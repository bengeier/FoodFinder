{"text":"Summer menu is amazing! Pork belly with cheddar grits is mouth watering! Short rib sliders, salmon, fried green tomatoes! Their beer selection is incredible best I've had outside of WI! Steak salad, pig ear appetizer and best chicken strips and bites of any restaurant hands down. So glad they are on the west side!
Also great wine list if you don't want beer! my first choice for brunch!"}
{"text":"Don't care for micro brews so the wife and I split a sandwich had one cocktail  $35, prices way high, service so so prob never go back"}
{"text":"Very cool spot for Peoria. Great beers, interesting menu. It's a little cramped but it won't keep us away. The service has been hit or miss, depending on how busy it is. I guess that's to be expected. Definitely give it a try, most will not be disappointed.

P.S. They also have live music and a nice patio to sit on."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely 5-stars. Had dinner here last night (spare rib, BBQ pig ear, tasting flight, scotch ale) and everything was delicuous"}
{"text":"I love this place!  This is exactly what the west valley needed!  The beer is great and the food is exceptional.  Try the burger...it's delicious!  The service has been terrific every single time we've stopped in.  Karlyn, one of the bartenders, gives great beer recommendations and is very personable.  Stop in, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been here about six times now and have not been disappointed yet.  You can tell that they really care about what they are putting out and it is really good beer.  Tiny and quaint with good beer.  Not much more you can ask for!"}
{"text":"The Litchfield Tap Room for Peoria Artisan Brewery gets five stars for being a great tasting room for local beer. While many tasting rooms have no food, they do have serviceable sandwiches and a meat and cheese platter - decent fare for paring with beer but not a family lunch or dinner spot. As someone who has tasted his fair share of craft brew, it's safe to say that you will not be disappointed (well, unless you consider the adjunct yellow swill that abinbev and miller sab produce in copious amounts as beer, but then you have other problems). I look forward to the new beers that they will roll out along with ironing out the wrinkles as they just established their location this month."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, design and brew.  Love that it was not so loud I could actually hear myself think. It will be a great place to work."}
{"text":"I keep thinking the service will improve!! Last night I went with 4 people, and were the first ones seated at an inside table. After approx 10 minutes, someone came and brought us water, and said they were not our waitress, but she would be there soon. Waited another 10 minutes, and left!! There were 3 people standing in the brew window looking through the glass and nobody did anything. When we left, there were 4 other tables, who were all looking for help also!! Won't go back for another try!! Could be a great place for a tavern!!"}
{"text":"Beer is good tried the an amber ale and honeysuckle with jalapeño wasn't sure how second one was going to taste but I was impressed no real jalapeño flavor just a slight heat at the end. Eat chicken club sandwich and it was good as well lots of flavor on chicken bun was good. Excellent service. I was hoping something different on menu that's only reason for 4 stars."}
{"text":"The taproom in Litchfield Park is a really quaint little place. Very friendly staff and solid brews. Stop by when you're in the west valley!"}
{"text":"A huge selection of their own beer and many others on tap. The food I've had was spectacular especially the jalapeño cheese grits."}
{"text":"Amazing find for a great craft brewery that serves a unique food menu. Dropped in mostly for a beer and discovered some great, uniquely-prepared appetizers and very creative sandwiches too. I had the PAB chicken bites and my buddy had the deviled eggs ... both in ample portions and different than your regular pub fare. I then had the meatball sandwich ... homemade grind that was served over grits with bread to scoop up all the deliciousness.  It had great flavor, a really fresh taste and clever overall way to make a heavy sandwich easier to enjoy. Definitely try this place out!

Had two beers, both PAB brews -- a Pale Ale and a Scottish Ale and they were outstanding too."}
{"text":"First time here and I am really impressed. The beer is good with an abundant selection and I ordered The fried pig ears because it was something different and I was not disappointed. The sandwiches and the fish fry are also great choices. Won't be my last time here!"}
{"text":"Loved the beer :) too strong of a cleaner ( lemon scent ) they use to clean restaurant and took away from the tasting of the beer"}
{"text":"Very rich tasting craft brews for all different tastes. I like IPAs and theirs are some of the best I've ever had. They do unusual things like infuse flavors in real time into tap beer, and make 32oz cans of your favorite brew right on the spot. The food is well above the average of what you typically get in a brew pub. I wish the actual 'bar' in the bar were a bit longer (I think it seats about 8), because  I typically fly solo, but I can typically find a seat."}
{"text":"We had delicious food and good beers. We came twice in a week, we enjoyed it so much. Loved the loaded fries, couldn't get enough of the beer cheese and really good bacon used. The burger with onion bacon jam was very yummy and cooked to perfection. I cleaned my plate with the pulled pork and waffle for Sunday brunch. Really enjoyed the Prophetic Soul beer too. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place and was super happy to see a brewery and something that wasn't a chain restaurant in the west valley! The beers were decent, but the food was awful. Our service was slow, our server forgot to enter our appetizer. I ordered the BLT. The bacon was good, but they placed a sweet jam on the bread in addition to the aioli. Weird combination and despite 2 different sauces, it was still very dry. My husband ordered the salmon and was not impressed. Not very flavorful and slightly undercooked. The side of warm pineapple was also blah. After our main course, our appetizer of chicken wings came. Meaty wings but gross. Super chewy and tough. The pickled celery sticks were weird. If this place would just stick with the basics and not try to be too creative, I'm sure the food  would be much better. Would rather drive 30 minutes to east valley for better food. Beer is worth checking out. I'm guessing the good reviews is just because there is no other competition on this side of the valley."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. Very cute patio area. I was there with three other friends. Had the buffalo pig ears which two of the four of us really liked. I ordered the French dip sandwich without the bun. The beef had so much fat on it. I tried to cut off most of the fat. I brought it to my servers attention. She agreed way too much fat. When she brought me my bill I asked her if she brought the fat to the chefs attention. She replied yes but that was that cut of meat???
The wine was fine.  My friends had the chicken bites which they said were fine. 
It was a cute place but not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"Just picked up 2 growlers full for a son who lives in Los Angeles. Apparently word gets around! Great place, cute interior, bar was filled with guys who just got off work and having a beer together. Patio large and shaded. Hope they have misters out there this summer and keep it usable. Yeah west side breweries!  We need more of you! Haven't eaten here yet, but looking forward to it. Bet it's amazing judging by the look of the hamburgers being delivered to the tables around me."}
{"text":"Went in there the first time a few nights ago, and it was amazing! Missy took great care of us. I didn't get a chance to try an entree, but the beer was fantastic!! I strongly advise getting a flight and trying a few, it's good stuff, believe that!!!"}
{"text":"Refused to serve me after I presented my perfectly legal California state driver's license. I don't appreciate being treated like a criminal when I'm just trying to enjoy a beer with my friends and family, so we took our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place! The service, decor, beer and food is always amazing! So happy this opened near by! Defiantly my new favorite"}
{"text":"Love this place! I would have absolutely given them 5 stars because their beer selection is awesome and so is the food but the service is lacking. I hope in the near future when we return I can update my review to 5 stars because I really like this place. So happy to see a gastro pub place in the west valley!"}
{"text":"While checking into the Cibola Vista Resort on the north side of Peoria they recommended this eatery.  I was not disappointed.  Our server, Missy, took great care of us, and she did not steer me wrong with her recommendation of the Southern Man's burger.  I couldn't tell you from memory what all was in it, but I can tell you it had one of the best combinations of flavors packed into one burger that I have ever experienced.  The salt and pepper fries were great too as was the pumpkin spice beer.  Now I'm clearly not the beer snob Jon B. is, but I know what I like in a beer, and this one was very good.  I would most definitely recommend this establishment to any of my friends with confidence."}
{"text":"Yes, I liked this place, I liked this place a lot. We came with our baby boy Sarge the German Shepherd and had a grand old time enjoying the summer air on the misted patio, tasting the many, many craft and unique beers by ordering flights (goodness knows I love me a beer flight), and the hearty burgers and those ROSEMARY PARMESAN FRIES, what, next time I will just put in three orders of those salty little potato angel fingers sent straight from above, along with, you know, my beer flights."}
{"text":"Here's my take on this place...

First and foremost, the place has a ridiculosly awesome beer list.  It has at least twenty craft beers on tap, all on a large board visible from almost anywhere in the place.  They even have some guest beers on tap from other breweries.

You get an individual list at your table, although it doesn't contain as much information about the beers as the board...would be nice if it did, but you can pretty much see the board anyways.  They will give you small samples if you want to try some before ordering.  Note:  only beer and limited wine currently.  My better half is not a big beer fan, so I kinda wish they had a full bar or maybe had a bigger wine list (maybe had some moscato), but hey, it's a friggin brewery so you can't hold that against them.

Most of our experiences here have been positive.  The place has a good vibe to it and they have unique events often.  One of the owners Matt is epic and very involved.  Super friendly and not afraid to help out his staff when needed.

We had one bad experience that was the result of either poor communication between the server and the kitchen or someone just dropped the ball.  We ordered an appetizer and the server asked if we wanted to order our meals as well.  I responded as long as they didn't bring the meal out on top of our appetizer that would be fine.  He assured us that it wouldn't,  so we went ahead and ordered it.  Naturally the meal came out literally three minutes (four tops) after our appetizer.  The server was very apologetic and said that he asked the kitchen to hold it but apparently someone wasn't listening.  I was a little surprised that no one higher came over to apologize and I expected them to comp the appetizer (we barely touched it) but they didn't...not the end of the world.

As far as other constructive criticism,  the seating is a little odd.  Some of the tables are literally butted up to each other so you are right next to a stranger...it's not a deal breaker, just a little weird.  The place is a little tight so I'm not sure they have much of a choice.  Could use some more restooms as well.

These are small items though.  Overall this place is really great.  I'm sure we will be coming here again and again.  I actually think they could expand next door a little...the place has been pretty packed each time we go.

Do yourself a favor and go check it out."}
{"text":"Great Sunday Brunch selections. We are told we are the first to have the exclusive \"Beermosa\"; our choice of beer was the L'Automne Saison, one of their finest. It's is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Food menu is small but yummy. Not typical bar food which is a nice change. Outdoor patio inviting though it has some road noise. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  Pleas come visit this nice neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Very cool vibe inside, but absolutely empty for weekday lunch.  I'd like to come back and enjoy the bar and patio at happy hour.  We need more options out here.  Interesting menu, ask before you order the pig ears....you've been warned.  I almost couldn't enjoy the rest of the meal.  I guess some people love them!"}
{"text":"The beer was good, but it took forever to get our food, they were out of several menu items (and it's a limited menu), the portions were not large enough for my husband, they forgot our appetizer and they didn't offer a vegetarian option aside from a salad. Who eats salad while drinking beer? Not me. :(  Sorry, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Was excited for this place to open and it didn't disappoint! Beer was awesome, especially the Chocolate Stout...so smooth. Got the wings and mac & cheese for apps and they were both good. Split the bacon burger for the main course which was delicious! It was good thing we got the endless chips with it too, because we got seconds. Our waitress was adorable. She was so thorough and checked on everything to make sure we had the best possible experience. Had a chance to talk to the owner before we left also and he was great. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner; waited over thirty-five minutes for our food.  After twenty minutes we asked about our meals and was told it would be another one or two minutes.  After five minutes passed my husband had to get up from our table to find the waiter and ask him where our food was.  He response was \"I am just the waiter not the cook\"......exactly.....you are the waiter so wait on us and go check on our food.  No apologies were given so no large tip was given.  Cross this one off of our list!!"}
{"text":"This the third time we have been here. Had the chilled corn soup and the summer chop salad. Both were delicious. My husband had the Monte Cristo sandwich that he said was the second best he ever had. The service was prompt and the waitress even laughed at my husband's corny joke."}
{"text":"Well I finally stop in after passing by a few times.  Waitress was nice but other then that i kinda wish I kept going. I mean the wings were ok and obviously the beer is beer. The $13 PAB Burger was not worth more then a burger  from BK  next to the brewery  and then to not even put all the ingredients on like the bacon and a real aioli sauce and charge that much. The avacodo on the blt were sliced thinner then the lettuce.  Also I'm no major food critic but when you have menu this small everything on needs to be up to par not mediocre."}
{"text":"Wow! you must have the Savannah Marie double IPA. it's one of my top-three beers! great appetizers, especially the pig ears (order them extra crispy!). the pork belly and the short rib sliders are amazing!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest experience but we won't judge on one visit.

The mussel broth was horrible.  Really, really offensive charcoal taste which some may like.

Salmon I had was good, not great.

Was looking forward to a great experience with staff and food but it fell short.  

Maybe next time?"}
{"text":"If you like good beer and eats, you better come check this place out!! ALL the food I've had here is amazing and I even went out of my comfort zone and ordered the Buffalo pig ears and omg they were so good!! The manager is an absolute gem, a total sweetheart who works alongside her staff which is highly respected. The beers they brew are and always have been great, and a good selection of other local brews. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The menu is elevated for pub food.  I've had the deviled eggs (YUM!), the Salmon, dry wings.  Nothing beats the giant pretzel though.  Last time their oven broke so we couldn't get a second one :(  The Green chili pork is more of a soup than a stew.  I have done flights of beer as well, which is always fun.  They do live music sometimes and have an outdoor patio."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get a beer. They don't have the biggest variety, but the beers that the do have on tap are delicious. My latest favorite is the Ruby Red IPA."}
{"text":"food was alright nothing brag about. But the customer service on the other hand was terrible! The server Stephanie had no personality and she was totally moopy. It was like she was put out by taking our order and having to ask if we wanted a refill. We asked for flight of beer and we waited atleast 15 minutes before having to ask her when it was coming and when asked she was all pissed off. She was totally rude! I would not recommended this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Loved it here! Great food and great beers! Definitely come check it out! Cool spot in the west valley! Our server, Stephanie, was excellent! Nice patio, too!"}
{"text":"Great beer and food in the northwest valley. Comfortable vibe, and they actually play decent music. The haboob IPA is fantastic. Foodwise, all the sandwiches I've tried have been good, as well as the \"dirty\" fries. They also have a fried pb&j for desert."}
{"text":"So finally after all is said and done, a brewery exists in the west valley!

Sometimes it can be hit or miss, they definitely hit a home run with this place! The beer variety of local beers, house and guest is amazing. Prices are reasonable so no need to to splurge and spend a whole paycheck.

Staff is super friendly and offer great service. Surprisingly enough they have a small limited food menu but to my surprise I saw a burger and salmon meal on there!!

Come by and check it out!!"}
{"text":"The beer is great, I guess that is why you go here. I have been to the Tap Room in Litchfield (same owners) and enjoy it very much. I was excited they were moving into Peoria. However, the food is just not very good. The Pretzel is bland and the dipping sauces are horrible tasting. This is a case of trying to be too fancy I suppose. Last time I was in Ian gave us great service. A couple days later I got an email from my bank asking to review my purchase with PAB because I had left a 50% tip or more. My bill was $20, I left a $ tip (20%). Yet it showed a $10 tip. I went down and the manager agree to send back the 6. I asked if I could see the receipt from just a couple days ago and she said no. I wanted to see if someone changed the tip. I asked her how she though this might happen and she said she had no idea and then asked it I wanted the other $4 back since I was asking these questions. My hope was for her to figure out why this happened so it does not happen to others. If my back did not email me, I probably would have never noticed."}
{"text":"Beer flights available which I always appreciate. Food was satisfactory. Will try again when I am hungrier."}
{"text":"Awesome brewery, great for pets.  Tried the flight.  Loved them all especially the HunnyHal the jalapeño beer. Our server Jessica was outstanding.  Would highly reccomend for a fun afternoon at the brewery."}
{"text":"Was referred by a couple we'd never met before as we chatted at another restaurant bar over a year ago.  We decided to visit one Sunday afternoon on their recommendation and have been making a visit most every weekend ever since.  We love all the beers and the tiny room ambience. They have a small menu with pretzels, sandwiches and a few other things!  The staff is low key and friendly and the neighborhood locals classy and well-behaved.  

Please don't tell anyone about it - - I don't want to ruin my secret spot!    ;)"}
{"text":"Looking forward to this brewery opening up in North Peoria!! Great beer and great people. It has been a long time coming and the time is near. Congratulations is soon to be had!!!"}
{"text":"The Savannah Marie Dbl IPA was amazing! I had the PAB Burger medium with dirty fries(worth the upcharge). It was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. My wife had the Chicken sandwich with bacon and avocado. She loved it and could not stop talking about how perfect the bacon was. The Hibiscus Saison paired nicely with the chicken. Portion size was good and service was excellent."}
{"text":"This is consistently my go to spot for great beer. I have never had a bad taste here. No super bizarre off the wall beers. Just great stouts, ipas, pales and others that simply are great. Quiet and comfortable place. Great service. Probably my only minor issue is the food which is just ok but I don't come here for the food! Great rotations of different beers, all fresh and wonderful."}
{"text":"Short pours, soggy sandwich, apathetic bartender. Had high hopes for the newly tapped PB Stout, but it was not good. Would be helpful to note somewhere that while all beers are $3.75 for happy hour, a guest tap comes in only a 10oz glass. Told the bartender my sandwich was terrible since it was so soggy and yet not only was nothing done about it, but she didn't even bother to acknowledge it. Been a few times with iffy results - this locks it ins as the last visit. Don't waste your time as your tastebuds and wallet will be sorely disappointed.

11/14 update to Matthew:
Thanks for your reply. I ordered a Total Crystalation from Ninkasi...which is 6.7% ABV according to your list. Additionally, please take a look at the photos I included as those pours are disgraceful. I know that there should be a little head on the glass but that's absurd. I accepted the first when the excuse of it being nitro was offered. The follow up same bad pour in a tiny glass is just poor form. The soggy, flavorless sandwich was the cherry on top. I did take my leftovers - which was about 65% - so I could try and fix it myself because, hey, I had to pay for it."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked through the door Katie made me feel right at home. With no breakfast this morning, I was starving and craving a good burger. I ordered the My Blue Heaven with the Rosemary Parm Frites. Amazing!!! The Passionfruit Sour brew paired well with the strength of the burger's blue cheese. Shout out to Katie again for her warmth and attention to detail."}
{"text":"Our anniversary fell on Mother's Day, so when we went for lunch it was understandably very busy. Our waiter was very friendly but slow and a little spacey (he didn't take our order because he thought someone else did, took 20+ minutes to pick up our bill when we tried to pay). However, the rest of the staff seemed very capable and on top of things in spite of the rush. The food was AMAZING, as were the mimosas and local beers. We'll definitely give them another try when it isn't a holiday!"}
{"text":"I've been to Peoria Artisan Brewery three times. Twice for food and once to visit the bar. The first time was a disaster. My table waited 2 hours for burgers and grilled cheese. The burgers were greasy and the grilled cheese was melted. He second time, we visited for brunch. The food was better than the first time, but still not comparable to pricing. The beer is worth the visit. Is recommend staying away from the food and just having a beer or two. I want to love this place, as it's only a mile from my home. Sadly, until the food changes, I won't."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to enjoy great beer and food. We had family visiting from out of state and went to PAB on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. The staff was attentive and very well versed in the beers.  True to form form the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great place. Had the short rib slider - it was awesome!  IPA and peanut butter porter were very good but the Irish stout was excellent!  If you like an Irish stout this is the place. Great staff as well - thanks to Jason for the suggestions."}
{"text":"When I hear the word Artisan I think of chewy bread with to many seeds. The Peoria Artisan Brewery over comes any thoughts of pretension with its unique menu items like buffalo pig ears which goes with any of the brez I tried.     
 My bevvy was the Angus Boy Scottish Ale. She be moorish.
Pours a translucent russet color with a tawny head. Thick lacing. Well-balanced mountain scent, with notes of bagpipes and plaid. Sexy tart flavor, laced with a touch of barry and . Heavy in the geggy with a smooth finish. Score: 4.06/5."}
{"text":"We started off on a little bit of an awkward start with our server. As our orders were coming out, the server dropped and spilled ketchup all over my boyfriend suede  shoes, the table and the floor and most importantly the appetizer. I figured she would have discounted the order or offered us a new appetizer, but nothing was offered . Two stars are given based on the beer selection. However, based on service, and not to mention the room temperature fries, we are hesitant to return."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre at best and our wings, fries and pig ears were so-so. The brew was pretty good but lacked carbonation."}
{"text":"First time here been to the Litchfield location many times! Ambience was good also a good beer selection. The beer I tried was spot on. Didn't try the food though. Service was awesome and the servers had great tats!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but has gone downhill. We enjoyed the finer ingredients such as the rosemary garlic fries, but now replaced with regular fries, like so many other things on the menu. Neat atmosphere but really no draw anymore."}
{"text":"Been here twice for dinner and drinks. Been kicked out at 9pm both times for closing. Went last night, bar was full, patio was full. Last call at 8:45. Everybody had to go so they could close. So weird to see a business kicking customers out the door along with their money at 9pm. Food is on par with pub food, liquor bar and wine menu is really limited."}
{"text":"Small Really great date bight pub! Awesome food and awesome beer! Great service and staff!"}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would because my husband and I were kicked out because politics were being discussed between us and 3 other people. We weren't disturbing or annoying anyone else except I guess this blonde waitress who told us that we couldn't talk politics in here. So we changed the subject and I started a conversation with some Indian baseball fans and all was fine until they asked me my view about  a political figure. I told them what I thought in a very low voice but the blonde waitress came over and told me that she had nicely warned me that no political conversations were allowed in this establishment. So I said that's right, so I guess I'm being kicked out and said goodbye to my new friends who apologized for getting me ousted. I was not mad or angry but it's unbelievable that this establishment does not hold up the 1st amendment, freedom of speech. I suggest you find a \"political correct establishment\" in the future."}
{"text":"Food was flavorful but not cooked very well. Unmelted cheese on sandwiches and over cooked fries. However, they have beer. So maybe you will drink enough so you don't notice."}
{"text":"Love to support local breweries and couldn't wait for another to open in the West Valley.  Visited during happy hour to try a couple of their craft brews and an appetizer.  A very nice list of draft beers including their own.  Unfortunately, they were already out of their IPA on opening day (really!!??), so I went for their saison, very tasty, and the esb which tasted like it was flat.  Ordered the 6 dollar small bite pretzel which is indeed a small bite.  Looked like a smaller version of a super pretzel from the frozen food section but surprisingly very tasty with a salty outer layer and soft inside served with a spicy mustard and in my opinion kind of bland beer cheese.  I would suggest for 6 bucks that they at least throw in another small pretzel.  All in all a nice place and the wait staff was pleasant and attentive.  However, I was a bit disappointed and shocked when I got my check for 19 bucks which included a whopping 2 beers and a small bite pretzel.  A not so happy, Happy Hour."}
{"text":"There's a little gem tucked away in \"downtown\" Litchfield Park. 

Brewery is a little bit of a misnomer here as it's actually a tap-room and there isn't any beer being brewed in the modest space.(EDIT: I've been informed they actually do brew the beer here so the batches must be pretty small)  The interior is spartan, with high top tables that are just slightly too close together and a couple of chalk boards to give you the low down.

I tried the \"Red Ale\", \"Pale Ale\" and the \"Chocolate Oatmeal Stout\".  Clever names to come, I'm sure.  They were all very good.  The stout was rich, the Pale was malty, and the Red was flavorful.  This place doesn't have a restaurant attached to it, but the ladies who work here will happily make \ a sandwich or provide a meat and cheese tray at a moderate price. 

Too bad the beer is so good, as I was hoping I wouldn't have to make the long drive more than once. I guess I'll have to make the pilgrimage on occasion to make sure they stay in business."}
{"text":"The area needed a local place just like this - not another chain! Friendly servers and management really made you feel welcome. Good variety of brews. Matt steered us toward some we probably wouldn't have tried, but ended up really liking. 

You can order flights (5oz tasters) for $2-3 each, no minimum and there were 20 beers on the wall menu to choose from. No happy hour food specials but the place wasn't expensive anyway, offering two sizes for appetizers. We tried the fries, pretzel and Mac and cheese bites. All good for snacking. We weren't hungry enough to order a burger, but saw one being delivered and it looked great. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"You must try the mac and cheese croquets. Mac and cheese croquets. Mac and cheese croquets. Has it registered in your head yet? It was DELICIOUS! I didn't even get a chance to take a picture because we were all fighting for those little balls of perfection. Our server Holly, was extremely attentive during our whole visit. We stayed and talked for 3 hours because I was visiting from Indy, and we never felt rushed at all!"}
{"text":"Craft beers, great atmosphere, excellent food, live music, just a great all around place on the far northwest side!"}
{"text":"Definitely trying to pig ears, the beer is cold and the service was great. I will definitely be back to this place on my next trip to Arizona"}
{"text":"OMG people this little place is a hidden secret ! Tucked away in a corner of a Peoria plaza . The food is so delicious it's a crime  Check out their social media page #Facebook #Instagrams for specials ."}
{"text":"Loving everything about this place. From the ambiance, atmosphere and awesome food. The PAB burger is great. Ordered is rare as they would plate it. Nice and juicy just how I like it. Fries are crispy and cooked in heavy salt and pepper. To die for! Server was responsive and attentive. I'm liking this quaint little place."}
{"text":"We are moving right into the neighborhood so decided to check this place out. I am so excited to have this locally owned and operated brewery in my neighborhood. My husband and I are not beer drinkers but the cocktails were delicious. The burgers on brioche buns were yummy and the fries with four dipping sauces were delicious. I can see us becoming regulars!"}
{"text":"Great food and beer.  We enjoy the 5 dollar burger wednesdays.  We also like the live music on friday nights.  Nice ambience."}
{"text":"I won't go back.  $60.00 for a salmon dip app that had 5 crackers and 2 entrees.   My chicken sandwich didn't have enough chicken to cover a 1/2 of the bread, and was clearly cooked in the am for our 6:30 pm dinner - so dry.  Burger was good - thus 2 stars.  Wouldn't recommend.   Not really a good venue to be that pretentious."}
{"text":"Great food, beverages, service & atmosphere.  A win-win for the parents.  We ordered the French dip, chicken pot pie & lots of beverages."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, the food was terrible, no information on the different beers, our waiter wanted to be anywhere but waiting on us and working and we felt every bit of that. 
I wasn't impressed and haven't been back. There are to many restaurants to choose from, then to have to go through that again."}
{"text":"Finally had an excuse to drive here and it as worth it.  Great selection of beer on tap (I had the flight and then the Brown).  Their small kitchen does a good job on some very basic food items.  They now have a pizza food truck stopping by.  This could be a real habit if it were closer to me.

And you have to try the Haboob IPA.  Full flavor and a great finish.  No bitter beer IPA taste for this beer. 

It's a little hidden but hopefully both the locals and the hotel guests in the area will give it a good following."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and drinks definitely recommend this place to grab a bomb burger and cold drinks to make your day even better great stuff."}
{"text":"UH-MAY-ZING craft beer!! The owners are super friendly and helpful when selecting a brew they think will suit your palette. My hubs and I love coming here. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It was a cool place but they changed up there entire menu so what you see on yelp is not correct. The chef likes to change things up but that was upsetting bc we went for what we thought was being reviewed. The service was okay our poor server had lots of tables and not one of the workers or managers was helping him do anything. We waited a long while for our beer and our waters! The food was okay, not anything great. The beer was really good. I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Peoria Artisan is a small Brewery with a larger menu of craft beers. They brew there own beer and have many outside beers. We were a little disappointed there were none of there own brewed stouts or porters. My wife had a  Uber Dunkel Lager and I had Malpais Stout . My wife like her beer. I have had better stouts. We both had 10 oz size drinks. $6 for the Lager and $7 for the Stout. Pretty steep for the size.
We My wife had substitute black bean burger with the Turkey Burger as her choice. I had the Left Coast Club. Both come with well seasoned french fries. They were both tasty choices . 
My biggest problem is the total cost of the meal. 2 small sized drinks, 2 sandwiches and a 20% tip equals $50.55. I can get better food and bigger size drinks at some of favorite breweries in the valley for less money."}
{"text":"Food delish. We enjoyed a couple apps and a couple sandwiches.  The crispy pig ears are AMAZING. Each bite has a burst of pork flavor that makes your tongue crave more.  I ordered the BLAT. It was scrumptious.  The tlasted bread didn't cut my mouth up either.  :) My hubby loved the short rib sliders. We also enjoyed our beers immensely. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Been here two times now and I have been pleased with the quality of their service, food, and drinks. Not much of a beer person but I enjoy their Amber ale. Their burgers and fries are good and my wife likes their sandwiches. They also make their own root beer which is really good."}
{"text":"Small brewery in a great location. Staff was fast and friendly and the restaurant was clean. It is a small place so it might be best to call ahead and see if there is a wait for large groups. There are is also outside seating but during the summer, it's beat to stay inside.  The brews and menu are short and sweet. The burgers are tasty and huge. The Italian beef is more of a beef sandwich since nothing about it tasted Italian. The sandwich is loaded with beef grilled onions and peppers on a cibatta. Argula and a horseradish spread was also added so again,  not very Italian but still tasty. Will definitely come back and try the other brews."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. First off the bathrooms were so clean and spotless that Mr. Clean himself could take a note. When you look at the kegs through the streak free glass window you can see your reflection as it gives you a constant reminder of just how much you have drank as you can witness your own progression of your own drunken state. The service is great!! The staff is so friendly that you should probably take a lesson on courtesy from them. The industrial feel of the decor reminds you how much you don't miss blue collar work but you can now appreciate what those workers really do. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants unique beer experience paired with excellent food quality. If you do go here ask for Bre. She is honestly, one of the best servers I've come across. Her timing with Everything was fantastic and she had a lot of knowledge on the products. I'll be back because of her."}
{"text":"We came here with some friends hoping to get some flights of awesome locally brewed beer. What we got instead were some flights of odorless, tasteless liquid. The beers they brew there were all terrible..and we tried them all. The only good one was a raspberry wheat and that was a guest beer. I don't think they take the proper amount of time to let their beer ferment or rest or whatever is required for it to have some flavor. Every beer we sampled was bland and had no finish, save for one dark IPA and even then it wasn't as bold as one would expect with an IPA. One of the beers tasted and smelled like bandages, another like dirt. We didn't try any of the food so I can't comment on that. However, the friends we went with had been there before and they noticed that the waitstaff were much less engaging than they used to be. We don't live near this place but if we did we wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"1st visit:

Absolutely awesome!

Great service. Nice patio bar seating. Great food. Most importantly, great beer.

I don't often venture into the west valley, but I'll be back to this fine establishment.

Buffalo pig ears were fabulous! Good charcuterie board. Fabulous tender meatballs.

Very good beers. Savannah Marie IPA,  Red Bite, Haboob Black all fabulous."}
{"text":"I'm a beer snob having lived near 3 Floyds until moving out here a few years ago and it took me a while to find a decent craft beer and craft food place that could even come close. With PAB's excellent food and excellent beer I found what I was looking for! 

The beer selection is good with a decent selection of their own beer and guests on tap and the food is delicious! Like a true craft brewery some of their selections do change, but I always look forward to what I can try next. 

Yes, their menu is small and it does change every so often, but I guess that is something I am used to, as again I lived near 3 Floyds and their menu was hardly ever the same. Everything we have tried on the menu has been delicious especially the PAB burger, you seriously cannot go wrong with it! Word of advice, when they have their fish and chips available order it as I have never been disappointed.

We go here multiple times a month and have always had wonderful service and even when we have to wait for a table the staff is courteous and welcoming."}
{"text":"Best thing ever:  their deviled eggs.... y'all, it's like Easter meets Christmas... you bite into these bad boys and find a secret stash of amazing housemade bacon jam.  I didn't even know bacon jam was a thing, but it is and it's wonderful shoved right into some deviled eggs.

Pretty dang good:  spaghetti squash and turkey meatballs. Let's be real, not many places serve healthier options like this and they really did a great job with it.

Also good:  warm brussels salad.  I think it would've blown my mind with a little more sweet to the salty, but it was still very good.

Very friend:  their staff.  Very accommodating and willing to actually talk for a sec instead of take your order and sprint off.

Meh:  the charcuterie board.  Didn't love it, didn't hate it, but it was there and edible.  

Not my favorite:  the beer.  I didn't love it, but didn't hate it.  Maybe my bar was too high as I wanted to be blown away like I was with those eggs.  

The food is a huge reason I enjoyed this place and, if I were local, I'd probably give the beer another chance.  Go try it and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"I've been back a couple times for drinks.  The staff is always friendly and the beers are pretty good.  Some are better than others but all and all I haven't had one that was bad after trying a few flights. I have heard from a couple people that the food was pretty good so I figured I'd give it a try.

This last weekend I went back for a date night and actually had some food.  We ordered a chicken salad, a BLT, and a pretzel.  The salad was supposed to have a vinaigrette but it had a thick mayo like dressing that it was smothered in.  It was absolutely disgusting.  The BLT had a ton of mayo as well and a tomato jam that was for some odd reason sweet.  I've never had a sweet BLT and never want one again.  We scraped off the mayo and tomato jam and ate the bread, lettuce, and bacon.

After the first two items we tried to give them one more chance and we were still hungry.  We asked for a pretzel.  A pretzel surely couldn't be messed up.  Wrong.  It tasted doughy and mushy in the middle and came with two awful mustards.  One was worse than the next.  

We paid our bill and left literally with a bad taste in our mouth.  The waiter was a young guy who was nice and seemed new so I really didn't want to get into the food with him.  Looking back I should have asked for a manager.  The place was barely a 1/3 full on a weekend so the owner should have a clue.  I am not sure if they are trying to overdo simple items or what but it don't get much more simple than a chicken salad, blt, and a pretzel folks.  

The chef needs to keep simple food simple.  I think this place could be a real gem if they could work out the food.  I'm really bummed about writing this review.  There's not a whole lot around here and this place had potential.  Not sure I'd come back now.  Best of luck."}
{"text":"I have only gone there once, decided to try it because the patio looked nice and inviting. They had a really good quad beer on tap, when I ordered a second one they told me they had just ran out. We ordered The fried mac & cheese appetizer and a burger, medium rare. It came out well done, so when we called the waitress over to have it fixed, she told us that the bacon makes it look different and it was really medium rare. Not quite! No matter how good the food is, nothing irks me morethen a restaurant so full of themselves that they refuse to fix what are inevitable mistakes. It's a deadly attitude that won't have me coming back, no matter how upscale and cute the atmosphere and no matter how good the beer."}
{"text":"The owners of this little brewery and restaurant are Extremely friendly and hands on.  Deviled egg appetizer is great, shows the owners Midwest roots. Nice selection of beers produced by their own brewery.  The servers are always helpful and quick!  A nice little gem in West Peoria ."}
{"text":"Great Brews, Great Beers and good vibes. For the NW Valley this small little place packs a good punch. You can tell they care and take pride in what they do here. First time here but will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My go-to brewery. Not just because it's nearby, (because we all know Saddle Mountain is closer...) but also because it has the best quality beer in Arizona. No wonder they're opening another location after only being open for such a short time. Love this place."}
{"text":"Went for crawfish boil for the first time, it was excellent! Excellent outdoor patio with Misters, Indoor space is pretty small. Will definitely be back as I was looking at other people's food, who didn't order the crawfish and it looked amazing as well. My only complaint was the Diet Coke from the bar was so flat & gross. I ordered a rum and diet Coke. Yuck. I know it's a brewery but still.. I switched to wine."}
{"text":"We revisited PAB on a Sunday night. The beer quality is still very good. Haboob is one of my favorite beers. The food menu has changed dramatically though. We miss the Haddock. I tried a Philly Cheesesteak and I was really disappointed. The bread to meat ratio was way off. The gigantic French roll was old, dry, and cold in the center. The \"rib eye\" shavings (tiny amount) were cooked to death and dry as a bone. This was quite possibly the worst Philly I have ever had. They need to change it or remove from the menu. I hope they don't fall into the trap of descending food execution that we see so often with new restaurants. Looking at recent reviews from other yelpers confirms the downward spiral. We'll give PAB another visit in a couple months and hope they start making good food again."}
{"text":"We went for the Whole Hog Roast, which was advertised as being from noon until 10 p.m. We arrived a bit before 5:30 and it was all gone. Very poor planning."}
{"text":"Offer $5 Wed burger but won't sell you because hours are wrong or it's Thanksgiving week.  Very rude about it.   No surprise so unbury"}
{"text":"Amazing time with family. Great beers and food. We came for the game but loved the place. A true time to visit. 

Try the dirty fry bar to start!"}
{"text":"Great beer and tasty food.  Nice atmosphere to chill out and have some good craft beer.  The only issue was poor attention by our server.  You should never have an empty glass at a brew pub..  My beer was empty and I still had some hamburger left to chow down..  C'mon man!!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Service was good, will get better. They are still working out the kinks, of course. That is expected with any new restaurant. I hope people read this before writing a crappy review. THIS IS A NEW LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS! SUPPORT IT! Have patience. Dont expect it to be perfect the first time. If you know that you're not a patient person, wait 6-9 months before even walking inside. If you like craft beer and good quality food, this is a great place. If you want Coors Light and a cheap burger, go toTailgater's. Lol DB  We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Best burger in the area, by far! I crave the PAB burger and the turkey burger too now that I've finally tried something other than the regular burger. The house-made bacon jam is to die for. The green apple jam and tomato jam on the turkey burger are also amazingly good, especially with the brie. Warm brussel sprouts salad is killer in the winter too. Do not miss this place if you're on the Upper West Side!"}
{"text":"Great little nano-brewery close to home with hand crafted beers.  Attention to detail is obvious and delivers high quality beers.  Can't wait to go back to try more!"}
{"text":"First visit, won't be our last!  Some great beers being brewed at this new Gastropub on the Westside!  Megan took great care of us, even initiating a quick brewery tour on how beers are made!  The salmon and their house ground burger were excellent!  Looking forward to our next time there, we enjoyed it all!"}
{"text":"PAB is a regular brewery that we frequent often. The owners are incredibly friendly and go out of their way to make their customers feel at home. We love the amazing selections of beers they have, whether their own brews or others that they bring in. The Crab boil was a fantastic experience, delicious is an understatement and Cameron sang beautifully. Such a sweet young man. My personal faves are the pig ears, grilled salmon, arugula salad, salt n pepper fries and their own brewed root beer. Jeff loves the Southern Man burger, mac n cheese croquettes, Lake Pleasant and Haboob beers. I'm super excited to experience their new fall menu. Take any negative reviews with a grain of salt. From the day PAB opened, we were there and have never had any negative experiences. Rather, we met the owners and have since gained very nice friendships with the owners and their staff. Perhaps we'll see an expansion in the future. ;)"}
{"text":"My wife and I went in with high hopes, as I've tried PAB beer at the Litchfield taproom and never been  disappointed. The beer was as good as ever; unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the food. Not only did it take an inordinately long time to be prepared, it was average at best. The bacon burger was so small that, after my wife was finished eating it, she had enough bun left to create an entire half bun. The fries were fairly dry and tasteless, and arrived barely lukewarm. Even the chicken strips we ordered for my son were extremely dry, with very little flavor in the batter. The only real saving grace was the pretzel, which was so good it's almost an insult to call it a pretzel. It was really the only thing we ate that would classify this place as a \"gastropub\" -- my wife remarked that she could get almost as good quality a burger at McDonald's. 

The server was polite and responsive, if a bit hard to find at times, and the atmosphere was relaxed and not noisy at all, probably due to the high ceilings and insulation. Overall, it's a nice place to go and have a drink, maybe an appetizer, but the food quality is not in any way reflected in the price."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this new place in Peoria....
Beers are great..
Menu looks a little on the on the bare side.. 
BUT let me tell you!!! 
Best chicken wings I have ever had!!!
Best Chicken in ALL the land!!! I would come back just for the chicken!! Talked to the chef.. He created a friggen masterpiece! Salmon is amazing as well!!!
Will def be back to enjoy this hidden \"gem\" in Peoria!!!"}
{"text":"Finally a great family-owned restaurant on the corner. Their parking lot is always full. Tonight was our first time. We are so glad it was all we hoped it would be because it's such a close place for a new hang out. 

I'm not a beer person AT ALL, but Roger did a fine job educated me and helping me find my inner beer soul. I loved the Heritage. I would have never selected a red ale but he asked all the right questions and in a sampling of 4, we found one I like. And I finished my whole glass. Great beer!

Norah took such good care of us. We happened to be there with a finicky couple and she was awesome taking care of our table. 

The food was great. The make all of their stuff from scratch except their pretzels which are ordered and delivered fresh from a local bakery daily. Their dedicated to good food and it showed (or tasted). Some of the things we ordered: salmon, charred romaine salad, pretzel, deviled eggs, chicken tenders and the club sandwich. We loved everything. 

Put your money into your community! Buy local family owned."}
{"text":"killer beer. good food.  try the pigs ears!  My review may be too short so i am adding that they flipped to the Arizona wildcat baseball game for me.  Will be eating here every time I visit the in laws."}
{"text":"Staff is friendlier and beers are tasty. I see things on the upswing with our local brewery. 

The vanilla rum porter is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Beautiful decor! I tried the berry cider, hamburger with bacon jelly, pig ears, and monte cristo sandwich. Everything was so delicious. All of the items are made in-house and the chef changes the menu regularly. My husband really liked the Savannah Marie IPA."}
{"text":"Enjoying the Nade's Reserve beer! Waitstaff attentive without being intrusive. Good music without being too loud"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Extraordinary food complimented by the best brew in Az. If you want a great date night, live music on the last Saturday of every month. I got the muscles my wife got the short ribs, we thought we were at a 5 star restaurant. Seriously service is amazing as well, kudos to Norah for that! This place is amazing give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Pab burger is 5 stars. French dip is 2. Beer is good but t not the go to place it used to be."}
{"text":"Awesome beer!  The food was all top-notch!  Our daughter loved the pretzel.  Super friendly servers.  Great place to be!"}
{"text":"I love their beer selection.  Really haven't found one I dislike.  Had the French Dip sandwhich which was good but a tad on the small side.  Wife had the Salmon with spinach and loved it.  Service was just ok, took a while to get our food but came just at the beginning of the dinner rush so not too unexpected.  Will definitely return to try their whole selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"So excited when we got here. Cool place. Good vibes. Air conditioning set to low. Here's the problem: we've been sitting here for ONE HOUR and still have not received our food. What the? A salad and a burger? Wow. Come on guys! We want to support you but come on!"}
{"text":"We had Sunday brunch which is served until 1pm on Sunday's.  The menu was amazing. I had chiliques which was green chili pork on tortilla chips with a fried egg on top.  John had pulled pork and waffles served with a side of homemade whipped cream and spicy syrup. Excellent beer menu and wine menu looked good as well. Mimosas and bloody Mary's were served as well but we didn't try them!  Happy hour was fun!!  Good service both times we have been there!"}
{"text":"Might be a great place for beer, not so much for food. I had a BLT, the bacon was rock hard. I paid $3 extra for the Parmesan fries, the were mediocre. The fries on the kids menu looked better. My friends son ordered a hot dog, which was served cold."}
{"text":"Service was good

Atmosphere was nice ( tables and chairs are visually appealing, however the wood seats could prove to be uncomfortable for some customers)

Server knowledge/ explanation of beer taste compared to more common beers was poor

Flight sizes are good size

Prices are average / good for what you get

Menu was diverse to satisfy variety of tastes, however it could include a few more items overall

Suggestion: beef up menu and include list of beers compared to common beers (example: \" If you enjoy New Castle / Kilt-lifter/ Dark Beers, we suggest you try our........\")"}
{"text":"Great spot in Peoria for great beer and great food. Michael was a professional and courteous server. We tried all the PAB brews and loved Savannah Marie (fruity start with a hoppy finish) and Angus Boy (great malty scotch ale flavor).The chicken bites were tender and juicy chicken strips- great appetizer. We split the blue heaven burger and the cheese was creamy and smooth, the potato bun soft and the bacon and onion rings crispy and delicious. Despite being busy, the staff took great care of us and made sure our visit was enjoyable. Thank you for a relaxing visit Peoria Artisan!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying... it's not all their fault. And I'm going to start with what I liked. The food was really good. My husband had their special of the day. It was a Short Rib over Garlic Butter Grits. He said it was the best short ribs he has ever had, and the most tender. The Pub Burger was good! I liked how the bacon mixed in with the burger meat made it fall apart yummy. Everyone thought that The Deviled Eggs were WAYYYY too salty. If the salt was toned down a little it would have been much better, might have just been a bad batch. The Mac & Cheese bites were really good, both crunchy and gooey.  The beer selection was a nice selection of rotating crafter beers. The flights were priced pretty decently. 

Here is where my first -1 star comes in. I called not long after they opened and made a reservation for 9 people at 7:30 that night. The girl said \"Let me check, put me on hold about 2 minutes. Came back and said \"That should be no problem! Would you like outdoor seating or in door seating.\" I told her I think in-door would be best. She said \"See you at 7:30.\"     My friend go there before me and was told that they had no reservation at 7:30 for a party of 9 under Ashley. So I came in and told them I had talked to a girl that morning that told me they even had room for inside or outside. I was then told \"Well the girl that was working up front this morning went home sick. She is the one who probably took your reservations.\" Ok... and it's not in writing anywhere? I don't understand. And the staff seemed annoyed WITH ME!? How this is all my problem I do not understand.   So even after all of this me and my 8 friends decided to stay and wait for a table to open up. It was a Saturday night and every place was going to be a wait, due to Holiday parties. We went to the bar and got some beers and flights. The bar tender was very nice and patient with us, as some of my friends were not familiar with craft beers and had to do some sampling. After we were seated, everything went very smoothly. The service was nice, the food was good, and so was the beer. 

My Second -1 star is because the owner was there. I even heard him say he was going to wait on a table. In my experience, a manager/owner should have come to us and talked to us. Maybe apologized for what happened. I don't need anything for free, but at least come and speak with me. The only person who spoke with me about the entire thing was the young hostess. Who I felt bad for because its not her fault. I hope that a lot was learned from this mistake. 

However, I will be back. I really loved the atmosphere. Very chic, modern and a little bit rustic. It is very small but I don't mind that. When you walk in to the dining room you see what I think was about 8 or more long bench seats and bench type tables. Right behind those there's a Large Bar with lots of bar seating, both on the inside and outside of the bar. They had a cute little patio on the other side of the bar where we ended up sitting. They had heat lamps that worked very well and kept us pretty warm. A few lights and plants outside. I enjoyed a lot of things about this place. So I hope to come back and give this place 5 stars. But as of right now I am a little embarrassed and upset that I told my friends from out of town I had made these plans only to end up looking a little foolish. It ruined the experience a little bit."}
{"text":"My hubby has been here 4 times and we were finally able to make it out together last Friday. We finally found an IPA that we both like-- the Red IPA was great. I also enjoyed the Pale Ale as I was just in the mood for a smooth, light beer that night. The food want tempting enough for me to want to try, it looked like something I could make at home easily and just a \"had to have\" menu. Maybe a signature appetizer would be helpful (hot, soft pretzels or fancy chips??) in keeping people snacking and drinking longer?

Small space, great beers, friendly service, light eats are the main things here. Also available are growlers to take home and enjoy. Give this local place a try!"}
{"text":"We love this place. It is so nice to have a local brewery with such high quality food, beer and service. Very kid friendly too. Patio area with misters is nice. We have had several things on the menu and everything has been excellent and not overpriced. Not only is the food fantastic but the staff is amazing also. If you have not tried out this gem; you should."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch & sample the brews today. Pet friendly patio, great! Great service! 19 selections of brews! Their own + from other craft brewers, great. Wings with pickled celery and hand made ranch/blue cheese dips, great. Chicken sandwich with fries, great! Impressed with the whole deal! Recommend! A+. All Good! If you are on the NW side...try them."}
{"text":"Enjoyable atmosphere! Had the steak frites,  they were cooked just right, I only wish I had more! One of the best Old Fashion I've had."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Drinks and food were small-portioned and expensive.  Also, they changed their menu 2 months ago, and now all of the things I wanted to try from Yelp pics are no longer available (steak & brussels sprouts, roast chicken, fried chicken, chicken & biscuits,etc). They took off the dinner-type meals, and now the menu consists of a few appetizers, salads, and a few sandwiches.  Check the menu on their website before going, rather than choosing from Yelp pics."}
{"text":"Best restaurant on the NW side of town. The food is delicious, service is great, nice atmosphere and one of a kind craft beers!"}
{"text":"Really cool, local brewery/gastropub on the northwest side of Peoria. I had the Caramel IPA and the bottomless homemade chips...both amazing! Great little local spot! BLTA sandwich with. Bacon jam was delicious too! Check it out!"}
{"text":"One star. I'm not being harsh I'm being generous. Let's go straight to the product.

Beer - nothing out of the ordinary, mediocre. Pricing, fine.

Food - Over-priced and underwhelming. Greasy, fatty, with a gourmet price tag.

Wine - Incorrectly labeled on the menu, don't order it either or you will be scolded by the service.

Service - Miserable. I can handle over priced food, I can handle mediocre beer, I can handle incorrectly labeled wine, but what I can't handle is bad service. Every time I came here it's been the same story, young service women with frowns on their faces. It doesn't matter if you came on a busy night or a slow one, just depressing people serving you with nothing more than a glance in your direction once for your order and once for your money. Don't bother mentioning the rudeness of one of the service women to the management because the red head manager on duty is the same age and cut from the same cloth as the others so you best not diss her friends or you are out of here.

Management - Also don't bother calling asking for management or the owner so as to dissuade you to write a bad review because I called and was told by management that she directly left the owner a note, and didn't even get a response. So Mr. Owner and fellow Peorians, read carefully, this place needs some serious re-staffing because no good times are to be had here, look somewhere else for a more 'primo' place to bring the gang."}
{"text":"What an interesting, funky little place . We've passed it numerous times always wondering what it was all about. I'd like to shake the hand of the person who decided to put bacon in the hamburger meat !! Our hamburgers were cooked to order and absolutely outstanding. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"So i met a friend of mine here for a beer.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the beer. We met the brewer who was amazing and seems very enthusiastic about his craft. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review of Peoria Artisan Brewery, full well knowing that the owner or Social Media person will post a reply pointing you to all the great reviews they've had rather than tasting the beer and realizing something is off.  Take my review for what it's worth, an honest opinion.

Went in with two local friends.  The ambiance of the place was great, cool hipster vibe, burnished furnishings and a view into the brew house.  The hostess was not the friendliest and got us to our seats after finding out that we just wanted a few drinks.  Having never been to this establishment - I ordered a flight of all their in house brews. 

Nice presentation on chalkboard boats with numbers indicating the tap, so you knew which beer was which.  This is where all the good ended. 
The beers lacked any nose, and had nearly no finish.  When drinking beer, there are a few things to take into consideration.  Aroma, does it smell hoppy? Fragrant? Floral? It's part of the tasting experience.  Tongue, how does the flavor hit our mouth? Is it sweet? Hoppy? Earthy?  Finish, how does the flavor continue to the back of the throat as you swallow? Is it robust? Is it fragrant?  Here's what we found...the best of the bad were the Honeysuckle and the Hefe.  Neither of which carried any body and nearly no aroma.  The finish on both was pleasant but not great. The Hefe was so clear it might as well have not been a beer at all. 

The worst were the remaining dozen or so that landed in front of us.  A few of them carried an earthy aroma of bandages.  Don't know what that means? Google it.  A chemical reaction happens in the early stages of brewing that releases a not so pleasant aroma.  Multiple of these carried such an aroma.  The culprit could be many things, but judging by the thinness of the drink and mouth feel of each, they are either not giving their brews time to grow and develop or they are not using properly filtered water.  Chlorine is a big culprit of the Bandage aroma.

The Angus brews are undrinkable, even if I were completely intoxicated - they would be undrinkable.   I did however taste them, gave each brew a chance.  Received no enjoyment from it.  I really wanted to like it, that's why we went.  They are calling themselves a brewery.  They are amateur brewers at best.  The best part?  There was one brew that showed up which was really delightful, albeit fruity which are not my favorite to drink.  #9 - full bodied, hit the tongue with a berry flavor and had a nice finish.  Turns out we got that one accidentally and it was not one of the house brews.

Go for the ambiance, if you're in the west valley and need a drink or want to watch a game.  I cannot comment on the food.  It looked fine, one person was eating out of the 8 or so who were in there on a Saturday night- if that says anything.

I would say maybe they're struggling?  Cutting costs having a hard time brewing fast enough.  Whatever it is...they should take time to sit and drink each of their beers and be honest with themselves.  Maybe cut down to making a few good beers rather than many mediocre or amateur brews.  I won't go back, you're your own person, you make up your mind...just don't be surprised."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because it's close to home and there really isn't any place else to eat. We came for dinner one time and the food was pretty good. 

Today's brunch was a disappointment. What made it even more so, is that you could tell that there was no care to taste or presentation.

The hashbrowns looked boiled  they were really undercooked. The breakfast burrito was super dry. The plate had no color on it and looked super drab.  My husband's ham had a weird oily sauce on top.  

My son had the French toast which he did enjoy.  The server could not be any nicer and kept trying to salvage our experience with apologies.  I felt that even she knew how gross everything looked. 

Not impressed. Breakfast shouldn't be that hard. I will not be back now for either the breakfast or dinner which is a shame."}
{"text":"The beer flight was nice.. atmosphere is good. the food is really, pretty terrible. I've tasted better pretzels at the mall.. the sauces were horrible. Wings were ok.. my husband's philly cheese steak left a lot to be desired and the chicken in my chopped salad was sooo over-salted and somehow the flavor of it reminds beds me of a barnyard or zoo.
All in all.. come for the beer.. skip the food"}
{"text":"This is a neat little brewery in North West Peoria, AZ. They have a revolving selection of high quality micro beers on tap and a small menu of artisan foods you won't find anywhere else. I particularly liked their PAB BLTA . . . 11 Apple Wood Smoked Bacon | Tomato Jam | Avo | Aioli | on toasted Sourdough bread. Make sure you get a side of the Matchstick Parmesan Fries! Yum!!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun spot to come to in the West Valley! Their beer list is always changing, so you can truly try something new each time you come in. I've never had a full meal here, but last night we got the Bavarian pretzel and it was delicious :) our waiter was awesome too, he was super friendly and gave great recommendations! 

If you're going to come here you have to try the Groupon deal -- a flight, two pints, and the pretzel for only $13 :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place for Sunday brunch and beers with friends. The food prices are a bit high, and the in-house beers were just okay. The atmosphere is great and having friends along made our experience even better. A couple of us ordered cocktails and they were really yummy. Because of the proximity to a couple of our friends' homes, we will most definitely be back - most likely just for drinks and to check out the patio."}
{"text":"Great beer! Best French fries ever! Are their last week and had them. Been craving them ever since. Going back there today for lunch."}
{"text":"Really good beer brewed here. The food was good, not outstanding, but I was here for the beer, and it exceeded expectations. Great service too."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try it out.  The service was terrible.  We stood at the door for a few minutes before a worker helped us and took us to a table.  She left, and we didn't see anyone else for about 10 min even though our table was right in front, and next to the bar.  Workers just kept walking by us.  Finally the lady that sat us told our waiter to come help us.  We ended up getting a few flights of beers, and a pretzel.   The beer was good.  They have a nice selection on tap.  The table liked the pretzel but with the service lacking so much, we decided to go elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"I love beer, especially local craft. Peoria Artesian Brewery has some very good brews, especially IPAs. Haboob, their black IPA, is good, but too much hop tartness for me. Despite my distaste for IPAs, their Savannah Marie DIPA is even better. However, the bartender Jason, and his customer service... well, sucks. 
I walked in, and was greeted cordially by waitress staff. The ladies present themselves well, and seem happy. Rather than being seated in the dining area, I excused myself to the bar. Two new customers (\"we have a Groupon\") sat ahead of me. The bartender engaged the couple, offering what types of beers to order. There is a second bartender (female) going off shift, who also says nothing to me. (From my experience and her avoidance, she likely was admonished for helping Jason, and now ignores new guests not on her register.) By this time, I've already decided I want to taste the Haboob and the Savannah Marie, and likely ordering the Savannah Marie. The bartender continued to ignore me sitting 2-feet from him, at the bar, until I engage him. He quipped about being free because one of the taps for the two new guests (also sitting adjacent to me) was feeding foam. (He nearly drained the keg to fill a 4-oz flight glass because it was foamy.) After served the two tasters but before I'd even lifted the second to my lips, he asks which I want, abruptly, \"have you decided\" tone and wording. Afterwards, I sat, mildly engaged but listening to Jason chat with the wait staff and two guys (regulars?) sitting next to me. He began venting about how bad visitors are, interruptive and demanding. Recall, this is with me (a non-regular visitor he may recognize) and two first-timers sitting feet away. He explained, he liked going to the bars but did not like serving guests. Soon after this \"don't bother me\" venting, the new visitor couple next to me ordered a sangria. Although not the worst events of my visit, I was astounded to see Jason server the new-guest woman a sangria. He filled a glass with ice, and poured what looked like Zinfandel over ice, top it off with carbonated soda, and then add a lemon to the rim; no fruit in the glass. (Isn't that the definition of sangria.)
I have been to this location multiple times, half dozen or so. On a couple visits, I was with my wife (who is not a beer drinker). The food was satisfying. The table service was good. Occasionally, there are delays during high volume cycles, but not unexpected. Wait staff tend to be apprehensive about describing what beers are on tap. Every visit on my own, at the bar, involved this bartender. They were eerily identical. Time for this bartender to be relocated to the kitchen; maybe washing dishes or something. 
IF you choose to visit this place, then ask for a table, as far from the bar as possible, and wear headphones -- trust me, you'll enjoy it if you do."}
{"text":"Best deviled eggs in town, the bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado is terrific comfort food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, they always have different beers on tap that are delicious and fresh. As I write this I'm sipping a cinnamon porter that's well rounded and crisp. Their Savannah Marie IPA, Red Bite IPA, and Haboob Black IPA are also delicious. Try a 4-beer flight and try what you like!

And the food. Oh, the food. First time I came here was for brunch, and I had pulled pork and waffles, a sweet and savory combination that was every bit as delicious as it sounds. 

Today is St. Patrick's day, so it's corned beef and cabbage for my husband (so good!) and a shepherd's pie for me. Both are amazing, check out the pics. 

Never had a bad experience here, the service is great, the atmosphere is welcoming and casual, and the food and drinks are superb!  Don't be shy about bringing kids, we brought them here for brunch and it was great. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!"}
{"text":"We had heard of a new brewery in the area and wanted to check it out. We did not find the one we were looking for, but we happened upon this one and we were so happy that we did. It is located in a quiet area that I would never think of to look for a brewery. We walked in and were greeted right away by the bartender and the owner.  They were both really friendly and extremely helpful. We started with one flight of 4 beers for $8 and those beers were so good that we had to get another flight to try some more, then the owner threw in the one beer we didn't get to try with the flights. Such a nice gesture! And to our surprise, all of their 9 beers on tap were excellent!! Usually there is one or two at any brewery that are not good, but we really enjoyed them all. It was so difficult to pick which one we wanted to get a pint of! Definitely check this place out. All their beer is great! Definitely try the Haboob Black IPA! We did not try any of their food, but it looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Kind of industrial layout with no booths, only tables and the bar. Good beer selection on tap. All local brews and of course their own as well. We tried all three of their house IPAs on tap, and they were all quite good. The pretzel we ordered was a bit on the bready side, but ok. Came with a nice, spicy mustard and a cheese dip. Happy hour is nothing to crow about. $1 off all beers, but no food specials."}
{"text":"Great food!  Had the salmon - wonderful spinach and great cut of fish, deliciously prepared 

Mussels were extraordinary - sauce was incredible 

Wings were a tie for our number 1 with some of favorite - right heat

White chocolate Stout was wonderful

PBJ desert was outstanding - great raspberry jam wow 

Scottish and amber beers also fabulous!"}
{"text":"Trendy restaurant with a very modern feel inside. Got the salmon and it was good but not anything to yell about. Had some creative dishes on the menu and intrigued me enough to want to come back."}
{"text":"If you want to wait an hour for two sandwiches, deal  with oblivious service and a bartender with an attitude, this is you place! Good luck! This just in,  after what is probably the worst customer service experience you've had in years, you  get a condescending response from the owner. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Amazing chorizo burger! Hipster kind of vibe, very laid back environment with awesome brews. Waiter was attentive, very informative as it was our first visit and we will be back! Def recommend it, only suggestion to the restaurant is more tvs!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this brewery after some family fun in the West Valley, why else would I be so far from home?! I was very impressed by the cleaniness and hospitality of the brewey and staff. The beer list is quite impressive for such a small location and didn't disappoint. I'm usually not a big hefe fan but I loved the strawberry fields. My biggest complaint was the IPA which didn't give enough of the expected hoppy flavor. We were sure to purchase some pint glasses before we left to support this local business. Wish them all the best and success!"}
{"text":"Attending their soft opening in Peoria. Loving the beer and wine selection!! Prices are SO reasonable!! Everything was so tasty!! The Mac and cheese croquets and homemade chips were AMAZING!! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars due to the atmosphere. It was just a big room and not very inviting. The food and brews, however, get 5 stars."}
{"text":"It pains me to downgrade Peoria Artisan Brewery.

Peoria Artisan Brewery is a small pub kind of place that offers craft beers and a limited food menu that used to be above average and sort of with a gourmet edge. Last time I was here I enjoyed an outstanding Scottish Salmon with lemon confit and skillfully prepared vegetables. I saw that salmon was still on the menu so I ordered it again.

The salmon was passable this time and didn't have the great sear and careful seasonings on it. It lacked the finesse it had before. (see photos..you can clearly see the difference) This time the salmon was served with couscous. The only flavor in the couscous was salt and nothing else. The couscous just tasted like a mouthful of seawater. My server did ask me how it was and I said \"just ok.\" She did offer to get me something else but I declined for two reasons. One the menu is limited and I don't recall wanting anything else and two..... I doubt the person cooking could pump out anything that taste good. I asked for some lemon to make the plate almost edible. Latter when I got home I looked at the menu and noticed I didn't get the lemon confit from the menu description. This plate was less than mediocre and nobody would re-order this salmon plate if it's made like this.

My husband had the Cubano Sandwich. He thought it was tasty but wasn't sure if they made it with Swiss Cheese and wasn't sure if his sandwich was suppose to contain Mortadella. Latter when we got home we looked at the menu and saw that they left off the Mortadella. So he was cheated.

BOTH our meals were missing an ingredient promised. The couscous was downright awful. I recommend to find a new recipe for the couscous.

If a restaurant is out of stuff I don't have a problem with that if that information is given to me because then I know what to expect or have the choice to pick something else. But when the customer isn't told about the stuff they aren't getting we feel cheated.

It seems like they don't have a chef anymore and just someone who gets paid to pump out whatever."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to relax. Nice to see some good local brews. Food is good but a little bit pricey. Their beers are quite tasty. I had the PAB Mild and Haboob and I was pleased."}
{"text":"I go to a lot of brew houses. I would say that this one is very average. I ordered the vegetable hash which was very fresh and tasty but did not come with potatoes seriously?  I don't know if any hash that does not come with potatoes. Now I did not look at the price as it as only 7.50 so my advise would be to make the dish more like 10.00 and add the potatoes and maybe one more egg as it only came with one. The beer was ok as it seemed like the beer they make, no matter what you order all either tasted like an IPA or had a hint of it and for me I can't stand IPAs. Now I am a vegetarian and this place has more bacon and pork on one menu than I have ever seen so if your into that I am sure it is great. I want to say the french toast and service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Diamond . I wish this place wasn't in the outskirts of Phx. I read an article about the restaurant and how they make EVERYTHING from scratch except the bread which they order in daily from a local bakery. So I was very excited to try it. This is so rare in the restaurant business and it is so much appreciated. I was visiting family that live in the outskirts and met them at this brewery... I was in a bit of a rush so didn't get to enjoy the full experience but from what I did.... it made the 45min drive worth it. I had one bite of my husbands burger (I don't usually eat beef) and it was almost almost convert-able (mostly vegan to meat eating fool). They had this onion bacon chutney that made my tastebuds sing. Then I ordered a salmon dip app that was so good and very fresh tasting. I will be going back here for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place...they have an amazing brunch and a good overall choice of foods. If anything, it's becoming a victim of it's own success... a bit crowded, a bit harder to get seated, and a bit of inconsistency in the kitchen. Service has become slower, and sometimes it seems like not as much care is put in the food as when it first opened. All in all, however, it's someplace that I will keep coming back to for its' special events and as a great place to grab a much higher quality of food and drink than is the norm in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stopped in last week after a long drive. Had a Black IPA and their IPA(can't remember the names) but both were super solid, definitely enjoyed those. Had the PAB burger and fries, which was excellent as well. Tasted like a fresh, handmade, gourmet burger, which is exactly what I was looking for. Zero complaints from me! I'd definitely go again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Meredith was AMAZING! The food, craft beer and atmosphere was wonderful as well! So happy to have found this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Love it! Great beer and awesome service. Glad to have this gem within walking distance."}
{"text":"This place is great, a wide variety of beers to choose from. We went on a breezy night and ate indoors. We had the pig ears which were spicy but good and the pretzel which was also good for our entrees we had spaghetti and meatballs, burger and chicken, our desert was fried peanut butter and jelly ice cream and shake ."}
{"text":"Most restaurants have cooks. This place has a chef. It's small menu but as a result everything is spectacular. Beer is very good too but the food is special."}
{"text":"Very fun place!  Much needed in north Peoria.  Great selection of beer.  Great food too.  The staff is fun and friendly with a very fun and inviting ambience.  My wife and I had the pretzel which was brought out with a couple of tasty dipping sauces and their PAB bacon burger, both were good.  I had their PAB Brown ale and brought home a growler of their PAB Scottish ale.  They also have a selection of wines for the winos out there.  Happy to have them in the neighborhood so close to home.  Thanks PAB!"}
{"text":"If you build it they will come.

Finially, the time has arrived, a local brewery in the West Valley, and their name is \"Peoria Artisan Brewery\", and these folks are here to stay.

Peoria Artisan Brewery  is located in a quiet area of Litchfield Park, an area that one would never think of to look for a brewery.  Located on a side street off Old Litchfield Road, Peoria Artisan Brewery is easy to miss (for those who aren't familiar with the Litchfield Park Area).

I have been to Peoria Artisan Brewery twice and the second visit was just as satisfying as the first. I have to admit.  Initially, my thoughts were, I'm really not a craft-beer person.  However, after just one visit to Peoria Artisan Brewery I can honestly say, \"I left converted.\" I can now proudly say \"I am a craft-beer person\".

As you walk into Peoria Artisan Brewery you're  greeted immediately by the bartender and the owner.  The staff is friendly, accommodating, and extremely knowledgeable.

On this visit I started with one flight of 4 beers. I samapled the Haboob Black IPA, Paul's Pale, Artisan Amber, and the Superior Chocolate Stout.  All of which were so good that I  had to get another flight to try some more. Needless, to say the Fields Forever, Day at the Park, Angus Boy Scottish Ale, and Savannah Marie IPA were of superior taste and quality.

I was pleasantly surprised that all the craft- beers on tap were of excellent quality and taste.  Usually, when visiting a brewery there is always one if not two craft-beers that are not particularly satisfying.  However, that's not the case with Peoria Artisan Brewery.  I can honestly say, I really enjoyed everything on tap . 

If your ever in the area or looking for a quality brewery stop by Peoria Artisan Brewery you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good selection of  brews and very  well done. I have been to micro brewery all over the west including Bend, and this is fine  brew. I also had a burger and it too was well above average.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend and I come here on occasion and are never disappointed. Our bartender, Mikey, always takes great care of us! We love the Shrimp & Grits and the Chicken and Waffles. Mikey even recommended the Beer Mosa to my boyfriend, which he surprisingly loved (he hates anything orange flavored). I highly recommend this place for any occasion, but I love their brunch menu. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Two days before Thanksgiving, we bravely ventured into this brewery at peak happy hour time knowing full well that waiting would be part of the evening. No surprise, it was, so we skipped the wait list and a couple at the bar generously surrendered their seats to us since they'd already been there for hours and were throwing the white flag. 

Front row seats to all the action. Bartenders scurrying around delivering beers nonstop. Those taps must've had wear marks already and the brewery had only been open a day or so. 

I was craving their famed Savannah IPA but since it was not available, I settled for the aptly named Savannah's Little Sis IPA. It was hoppy as expected and did not disappoint. We also enjoyed the brown ale and some of their other own beers. It'd only been a glass or two in and my hubster was already asking about growlers. Good beer, Peoria Artisans! Mission accomplished!

No lie, the kitchen was way backed up but the deviled eggs (full serving of 5 halves) and rosemary frites (really fries) found their way to us. Both were really good. Bry thought his burger was good, but the short ribs with grits was the true stand out. Bry was upset that I would order such a technique sensitive dish when they were obviously so busy that evening, but I'm glad I took the risk because I did really enjoy their short ribs. 

I'm sure this brewery will find its groove soon. Their beers are definitely worth a repeat try and they are quick to serve them. I stand behind those short ribs with grits too!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere! Good service! Burger was really good, and the country fried chicken was descent. The corn that was with it was awesome! The gravy was also a plus, however the chicken itself wasn't that great. Will probably just go with a burger next time. Great choice of beer and the white sangria was refreshing."}
{"text":"Excellent beer. Well worth the trip way out west from central Phoenix. Tremendous variety of their own beers on tap, sometimes more than less. Last time I was here there were 12-14 on tap, tried two different flights. This time, they're down to just 4, 
Food is strictly bar stuff. Great tiny pub atmosphere in old town Litchfield Park immediately adjacent to the Wigwam Resort. It's like being in 1960's Palm Desert or Palm Springs!"}
{"text":"Great place for beer and food! Everyone please support your local craft brewery so we can keep them around for years to come."}
{"text":"We are in love!!  We come here several times a week....for the beer, the food, and the camaraderie.  Neal's talent for brewing beer has ruined us for all other beers.   The red IPA and chocolate stout are stellar.  On the menu is a grilled cheese sandwich beyond compare.....3 types of cheese, caramelized onions, sweet spicy mustard....yum!!!  The A-team behind the bar complete the ensemble. The taproom is a true gem and not to be missed."}
{"text":"FINALLY got to this place last night and was so happy with everything. It was a bit pricier than I expected but the beers were delicious and Im so excited to find an artisanal style restaurant in the NW valley. Will definitely return since they have such a good happy hour window, parents can finally enjoy happy hour prices and bring their kids!"}
{"text":"Great little place!  We went here for a little date night with friends they had beers I had sangria and we shared a pretzel and the cheese board.  All was awesome!  I totally would come back and try some real food, it all looked delish coming out.  They also have some great looking different hand crafted cocktails. Oh and homemade root beer in tap!  They have s cute outside patio area and the inside is smaller but has places to accommodate a bigger group."}
{"text":"So happy to find a brewery and taste room near us!!! Olde town brown and artisan amber are delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I like this place for the bacon burger and a nice selection of beers.  Other food items were good too. We have never gotten good service though. The server (we had the same one twice on separate occasions) didn't seem knowledgeable about the menu items and took too long between check ins. The food also took extremely long on our second visit and there was hardly anyone in the place at the time."}
{"text":"I am giving this Brewery one star due to the awful service and the rude staff. The rules change every time and so does the menu. When I first started going to this place it was awesome and the food was to die for. Now they have gone cheap and stuck up just like half the people in peoria. DO NOT waste your money at this place."}
{"text":"I love that I have a brewery only a mile from my house. The beer is great I have only had about four varieties yet they have not disappointed. I have gone in to fill growlers and not yet eaten there but it always looks good when I go in for beer. I highly recommend drinking local and trying their food and beer. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't good. She totally orderd the wrong appetizer. As she was bringing the plates out she asked \"You ordered pig ears right?\" We were like no, we ordered the pretzel.  No big deal but then our food arrived before the appetizer.  So of course I was like um, we obviously don't want the pretzel anymore.  The thing is it was pretty slow and the service was this bad, geez guys. I could of handled the entire restaurant, I'm serious.  Even when we walked in we saw, I'm assuming the owner or manager was chewing someone's butt right in front of everyone and stated \"it's not even busy\". I had a bad feeling after that.  I also felt it is never a good thing to reprimand your staff in front of customers.  Leadership 101. The beer was good but over priced. 7 bucks for a small beer, WOW! The only good thing was the burgers were very good but small.  Either way, I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon. I would of just for a beer if it wasn't so pricy."}
{"text":"Way out west in the dusty high desert town of Peoria, AZ, also known as \"go-east-young-man-there's-nothing-to-eat-out-here\", lies a great little local pub. 
Peoria Artisan Brewery is easily one of the best places to eat and drink west of Central Avenue. From the huge list of in-house handcrafted hops to the small but delicious menu, this place is exactly what we have been craving in our neck of the woods. 
The staff is very knowledgeable of the different styles of beer and willing to make recommendations based on your tastes. Service is Impeccable as well, we bombarded them with a party of 12 and they treated us like family, thank you Tara! 
We love PAB!"}
{"text":"Cozy, well appointed neighborhood bar with good food and very good beer.  Has vege options we all liked and really good fries, french dip etc.  Matt the owner checked onus and introduced himself.  Server was great and the staff covered the whole restaurant as they saw what was needed regardless of assigned area.  Lucky neighbors!"}
{"text":"I just received quite possibly the worst customer service I've ever received in my time going to restaurants.

1. It was a busy Saturday evening and we were told there would be a 30 minute wait which we were fine with-at no time did the service offer us a to look at a menu to review or something to drink while we waited-we literally stood near the entryway for 45 minutes with zero hospitality whatsoever.  
2. There was a group before us that had an infant with them and it was a chilly evening though it's Phoenix no one offered them a warm spot inside to wait with their baby.  
3.  There's a fully functional patio with three propane heaters on it none of them were functioning and there was plenty of wasted seating out there. I couldn't understand this because people were actually offering to sit out there and they were being turned down and told that the heaters were not turned on.  My guess is 4 to5 families turned and left when they were told about the wait time.
4. A group arrived after we had already been waiting about 30 minutes and started asking us questions about the wait time. The host came up and told them that it would be an additional 30 to 40 minutes wait time-when the woman with the group asked \"is there a list\" he claimed that he had a very good memory and didn't need to start a list with an arrogant tone.  
5. The same group was offered menus and drinks while they waited and temporarily seated at a pub height table that we assumed it was ours just after he told us he was going to clean it off for us.  
6.  The group accepted and when we asked him what was happening he told us that table was now going to be awaiting area-at that point members of the group he seated at the table he previously offered to us actually stood up and offered to give us the seating which created a very awkward situation among the guests in the establishment.  
7.  At this point my patience had run out and I asked the host what his plan was to get everyone seated he told us everyone would just have to wait-I looked at my group and we all decided to leave-he then 
asked us are you leaving? I said yes it doesn't appear that you want to seat us. His exact quote to me was, \"Oh you can stay if you want to.\" What a horrible thing to say To people that are trying to come into your restaurant.  
8. We chose your establishment over all others in the area.  You should want us to stay.  If I were the owner I would get busy with some serious customer service training because I can tell you My Wife and I are not going to come back and When people ask us about our experience we will just have to b.  

9. By the time we left we wasted almost 45 minutes of our evening standing in a business that was not equipped to serve the Peoria community.

10.  Is the beer and food good?  Couldn't tell you.  This was our first and last visit.  

11.  Our friends we were with recommended this place and I feel bad that everything blew in their face.  Let's see if the owner cares enough to do something nice for them so maybe at least they will go back. 


Update...
Let me go ahead and conclude by saying the owner still has a few things to learn-he and his staff accuse me of being aggressive and threatening?  Seriously?  I'm standing there with a minister and his wife that were excited for us to try the establishment so how does this make sense? We were all very polite when we left?  Sounds to me like the Artisan employee is deflecting blame here. If the customer is always right (as you stated) the situation would never of happened.  Your employee gave away our table to another group after we were standing in your entry way for 40 minutes.  I'm pretty sure you would've been a little bit irritated If the same thing happened to you."}
{"text":"Food was good, did some beer tasting, service was so so. 
They try to do a community table atmosphere but it's done on regular height tables and chairs and they make you sit across from each other.
We got there about 7:30 and it was busy, they took us to the community table even though there was a four top stand alone available, we asked if we could sit there and the manager made a face and told us they wanted to keep it for a table of four (we were 2 ppl), so we went ahead and sat at the community table because there was a line behind us.  Not 5 minutes later they sat a couple (2 ppl) at that table.
Sitting at the community table we shared conversation with the other folks but the waitress would disappear unless we flagged her down.  They also twice delivered our food to other people and then picked it up and brought it to us.
I hope they can workout their customer service, cause it's a cute place.
I won't be going back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first visit this morning. Nice menu choices. Service was great. Food was great. Will be back to try more things. Love to support the local restaurants."}
{"text":"Well as I walked in the door and the hostess asked if I could be done in an hour rather than a normal restaurant that wants me to enjoy the food and take my time.  That really turned me off and my friends couldn't believe it.  The food was ok not great!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Mac and cheese croquet appetizer, amazing.  Yard bird and short ribs also delish.  Lots of craft beer on tap.  Mostly theirs. But a few other locals too."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. They have good food and great beer. My favorite beers are the Savannah Marie and the Haboob. They bring in great guest beers as well."}
{"text":"Excellent place! Nice pub food kicked up a notch. The beers are great . Nice outfit patio. I have taken home some outstanding growlers for a few parties as well. I highly recommend this microbrew place!"}
{"text":"Seriously love this place. The food is fantastic, the staff is so friendly and the location is low key. This is a hidden gem! Their selection in beer is so unique but everything I've tried on recommendation from the staff has been delicious. Check this place out!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Reminds me of the breweries I miss most from Seattle. Really good food (especially the pretzels and burgers) and awesome beers. Kid friendly too!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for my birthday last month. We were able to make a reservation for a larger party of 9 without issue. Had a great table on the patio. Door was pretty decent and our server was friendly. We had a couple of items not properly prepared, but it really wasn't that big of a deal. Would go back! It's nice having a local place to eat when most things in that area are chains."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise to find this little gem on the west side! We enjoyed a couple of beers and a pretzel appetizer one afternoon. It is situated in an unassuming strip mall so you don't expect a ton before walking in the door but open the doors and one will be pleasantly surprised with the decor and vibe. Well done!

The hubs ordered a flight of beers, all IPAs and enjoyed himself. I went a lager that was OK, but I probably wouldn't order it again. Its pretty cool that they have a happy hour on the weekends -- we ordered a pretzel off the menu. I thought the pretzel itself was fantastic but wasn't wowed by the mustard or beer cheese. Pretty standard. 

I would like to go back and have a meal, they have what seems to be a pretty decent menu just from reading it -- and they have some sort of PBJ dessert which sounded bomb."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  The beer is fantastic, the food is the best in the area, and the people are always friendly and attentive.  The beers and food change so there is almost always something new.  You can tell the owner and employees care about the business and their customers.  Don't miss PAB!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because my friend recommended it. Best turkey burger I've ever had. Brie and jam on a turkey burger? YAS. My pal had the pulled pork and waffles. Oh lawd. So good."}
{"text":"Impressive!  The food!!!  I love the bavarian pretzel along with both dipping sauces, the fried zucchini...the cornmeal batter is fantastic!, the burger was cooked perfectly and the sauces on it were superb, the deviled eggs...wow!, and to top it off for dessert we had the fried PB & J and it is so good I want to go back for breakfast and eat it again.  The beer...I don't drink, but the others in my group really like their IPA :)"}
{"text":"So glad to finally have a craft brewery/restaurant  on the northwest side!! Hopefully PAB will be here to stay!  and based on what I drank/ate today I don't see why not!! Beers were great- list of all local AZ beers. Good variety of styles. One area of improvement would be adding the IBU's and a description on the beer list please!!  definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by the variety of their beers. Usually a brewery will have 5 or 6 beers and they have about twice that. They also serve guest beers. I tried the Red IPA and it was very good. Kind of a amber smooth with a nice contribution of hops. Very well done. I visited on a Friday around happy hour time and pints were only $4. I will definitely return to try more flavored. The were opening a cask at 5pm which I didn't try because they were serving it at room temp. I love cask brew because it's smooth like a nitro but you can keep that temp stuff. Why not route the distribution tune through a cooler of ice? Apt her than that Peoria has a great brewery."}
{"text":"Went here on a busy Saturday afternoon. Great little cozy neighborhood spot...friendly laid back atmosphere. I'm not a beer drinker but according to hubby they have a great selection. We tried the salmon spread and I had the turkey burger. Great flavor...fancy breads. Love it...Would definitely go back.  Service was a little slow due to the crowd but we weren't in any hurry so no problem."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Their beer was nothing extra ordinary and their food is nothing special. We ordered their wings, which were good and the Southern Man burger. Good place for drinks and appetizer."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite find in the Peoria area. We live merely 5 minutes away and have always drove by and we finally decided to stop by today, Sunday, of Memorial Day weekend. Kayla was our server and she was very sweet and attentive. I only saw 2 other employees, but the establishment is pretty small so it made sense. The spicy Bloody Mary was delicious, and it was indeed SPICY. We also tried the French dip and the club sandwich which were also great. The ranch was so unique and yummy and so were the fries! So crunchy and golden. I do have to say that my club got a bit soggy with all the aioli they put on it. My bottom bun didn't last long. But overall great experience, good location, yummy food, and friendly staff. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was okay. It seemed they were short staffed. The tacos we're alright, they fell apart. I'd recommend new tortillas."}
{"text":"First time in their new place. I would highly recommend checking this place out. Same great beers with outstanding food."}
{"text":"This place was really good! Walking in, it looks like a small brewery & restaurant. It did make me question wether the reviews were true, but I was impressed. We ordered the Burger which came with bacon & onion jam (which is amazing), lettuce, & aoli and a side of fries. It was delicious & had a really great flavor which I think came from the meat & the jam. We also had a pretzel which was good, but I didn't love the cheese it came with. Also, buffalo chicken wings which were also great! The wing sauce is made in house & the wings were cooked perfect. Crispy, not too saucy, & the sauce wasn't the basic buffalo you get every else. I was impressed and definitely would go back. Prices were fair & service was great."}
{"text":"Great food, and awesome beer! They stumbled a bit when it came to service. We were treated very well, the issue was that the servers we encountered weren't organized or communicating with each other. We were left hanging without a server, brought food that wasn't ours and then handed the wrong check. We will definitely be returning for the food and the beer, but hopefully by then they'll have streamlined their service."}
{"text":"We were in town and wanted to try a new, non-chain restaurant. When we entered, multiple people greeted us and we were quickly seated. Our server brought over water immediately but she was very inattentive after that point. I'm giving the service here a three since we had to ask for plates and silverware from another server since lots went MIA.

The food was excellent...I'll give that 4.5 to 5 stars. We had the deviled eggs and burger. Both were solid and flavorful. I'd come back for the food but...would likely request a different waiter."}
{"text":"My folks and I went there for dinner last night. I really really wanted to like it and find a cool new spot near their house.  The atmosphere and decorations were great. The beer flight presentation was also delightful - Very rustic and cool.
Service/initial greeting: The service was missing a warm welcome when we came in. The woman who finally seated us didn't look like she wanted to be there or that she wanted us there for that matter.  
Beers: I struggled to like any of the beers in the flight. #17 was the best of what I tried. I'm from Oregon and really enjoy craft beers, but theirs missed the mark in my opinion. I agree with the other reviewer, maybe focus on making 2-3 really good beers.
Food: I think they just need a new chef and start over.  My mom's salmon was served on room temp coos coos (I think It should have been hot, but when we asked the waitress, she took the plate back and returned stating it was supposed to be served Cold.  BUT it wasn't cold either! Just uncomfortable room-temp like it had sat out for too long!). My hamburger was flat, over cooked/burned and the bun was so hard, I just removed it. 

This place has the bones for being great. It's got the right idea, but I think management needs to make the tough call for new food to be served. And take a deeper look into their beer. I would also recommend tasting notes be added to the menu to describe their beer.

That's my two cents. I really hope they make some changes to create a friendlier atmosphere with better food."}
{"text":"Last night was our second time at this neat little place with our friends.  I wanted to go back before a review to see if our first visit was the exception. Decor and ambiance is pretty cool. 

They have a lot of beer options that seem to change frequently. So if you happen to get one you like, you may not see it again. Apparently they are in the middle of updating their menu (which isn't huge to begin with) because we kept striking out. First, the beer we had last time was gone, the vegetable lasagna and white sangria are both no longer available. I should have asked what else isn't available. 

Prices are fairly high for what you get.  A small Caesar salad for 4.50 that was about as large as 1Cup!  They highly recommend the \"dirty rub\" which is a $3 upgrade to their fries that to us tasted like Lawry's season salt or the free stuff you can get at Freddie's. Quite unimpressive. 

We had the roast chicken sandwich but we expected both orders to have more flavor. A little dry. Needed to add more Aioli sauce. We also found bones in the chicken and some fat pieces didn't get cut off from the leg. 

We aren't in a hurry to go back. I hope they turn things around and improve the menu accuracy, food quality and reasonable pricing. There are a lot of competitors around and this one has the potential to be a great off-the-path local place. If you're coming for the beer, you'll probably be impressed. If you want to eat, get the wallet out and be prepared to eat and think...I could have made this at home."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and had a great experience both times. Our server was really friendly and the fish fry was awesome! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other afternoon - strip mall location :( - ok I was in for a surprise.  Beer was good and cold.  I had a great sour.  Burgers were very good.  Mine had a bacon relish.  Had the most amazing fried pigs ears.  Coated with a BBQ rub.  Did I say amazing?  I'll be back for the ears and beers!"}
{"text":"Great brewery for the area. Tap is a bit limited but you won't find much better for the area."}
{"text":"This was a nifty little place we found by chance. The beer is really interesting and there were a good number of choices all brewed right there on the premises. If you have never been to this brewery, get a flight and then you get a taste of four beers, your choice which ones.

The service was a little bit slow--but we were in no rush, so no big deal.  My only issue with this place was the lighting. It was nasty bright fluorescent light that has no place in bar. Get rid of the florescent tubes, dim the lights and you'll have a perfect little place.  Food wouldn't be a bad idea either, but this place is so small that I'm not sure they could handle a kitchen."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I've never been much of a beer fan...  at least until I discovered Peoria Artisan Brewery this past Thanksgiving weekend.
The beer menu changes with almost every visit, if you're uncertain about a particular brew, the staff will pour you a free sample.  
Be adventurous and order a flight...  you can't go wrong!  Just save the Artisan Amber for me!!!
Their grilled cheese with grilled onions and the BLT sandwiches are fantastic!

At the risk of overcrowding my new favorite spot, take a drive over to this place, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"OK, it took a bit, but we returned to PAB.  The experience was night and day.  I believe it was 14 of their beers on tap.  Bri, our server, was fantastic.  My son and I went for the microbrewery experience and had exactly that.  Instantly our beer preferences were apparent with our difference in beer flights.  I had the sinful cinnamon stout and it was great.  I am not an IPA fan, but the Habboob Black IPA was fantastic.  It has enough body to carry the bite of an IPA.  I'm not a \"bong water\" IPA fan, but this IPA is good.  The brown ale is amazing, better than New Castle.  OK, New Castle is really good, but this is brewed locally and so much fun.  Matt has messaged me to come back on several occasions and I am glad I did.  This was the experience I wanted in a local microbrewery.  We only ate the pretzel and croquets (sp?), but I have my eye on the cro**** (meat, cheese and __) plate.  We will be getting that the next time in.  There will definitely be a next time.  We had a great time and will be certain to bring friends in the future.  I look forward to trying the ever changing beer menu as that is what a microbrewery should offer."}
{"text":"We Had a great experience at the Peoria Artisan Brewery last night. We started with the fried pig ears, very tasty! I am a hop head and asked the bartender which IPA I should try and without hesitation he recommended the Savannah Marie, it didn't disappoint, delish! My wife ordered a nice glass of wine and the Salmon, which was cooked to perfection. We were pleasantly surprised that PAB is gluten friendly as well. I ordered the Monte Cristo sandwich and had the Haboob black IPA which paired pretty darn well. All in all it was an awesome experience and we will return time and time again."}
{"text":"Do not eat at this place   The worst customer service I have ever experienced.    Long waiting time for food and when you received our french dip it was like shoe leather.   Rude staff, asked for salt and pepper and was told with a sigh, \"I have to walk clear over threre to get it\".   Also hair on the plate!  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"First came here with a Groupon and have been back several times. Good variety of beer and tastes great. Great service."}
{"text":"Beer is pretty good. IPA's are solid. Sat at the bar and the service was not bad. Not super attentive, but that didn't bother me. I'm never in a rush when there is beer around. The number one reason you should come here is THE FOOD! I ordered the Chicken Club sandwich and it was honestly one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The aioli, the bread, the avocado, everything is on point. Come hungry and come often."}
{"text":"Beer was average at best and below in most areas.  Just not tasty.  Food was worse.  Had the blue cheese burger.  Burnt and way too salty."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times including their soft opening and a month later with my friend who I really felt I had to show how cool a place had opened near his house.

I really enjoy this place, though they are only a month old and still figuring things out. I look forward to the day when they have a bigger selection of their own beers, as their Litchfield tap room is consistently outstanding (if far away).

When you come here, you will find:
 - Servers who know the beer and food menu and are willing to give recommendations.
 - Several AZ beers including 3-5 of their own brews.
 - A really interesting selection of food. (Really, we have tried dishes we would not normally order only to be totally impressed (deviled eggs, I'm talking about you)).
 - A cool hangout.

I am excited for what this place will be, but they are already very very good."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I had the salmon which had a caper dill sauce and sautéed spinach. My husband had the steak frites with sautéed cabbage and spinach. The salmon was one of the best preparations I have had. My husband was equally impressed with his meal."}
{"text":"Uh I have died and gone to fat guy food heaven! Omg I can't say enough how good it was. First time visit. Amazing! Sat at the bar. Jason took excellent care of us. We had a general idea of what we may get for brunch but he steered us in the right direction. Had the Bone Marrow! Took me back to being a kid in Germany. My Opa would approve. Also had the pulled pork waffle with Maple Pecan syrup. If you put all the syrup, honey, butter, and whip cream you are in for a taste treat! It's so many cohesive flavors working together to deliver the itis. I will be back and often."}
{"text":"The beer here is very good. I've already enjoyed their range of original and guest taps. The food is good but I was really hoping for better. 

The crispy chicken bits - the chicken was good but it was over priced for what we got. For almost $7 I was looking for more than 4 pieces in this appetizer. 

The goat cheese salad - this was basically a handful of lettuce, two tomatoes, and a lot of goat cheese. Good thing we ordered it with chicken! I really expected more from a salad. This would have been better with more greens and less cheese. The goat cheese was really good but there was too much. 

SXSW - this was actually the best part of the meal. The black bean patty was really good although it fell apart while eating. Really liked the fries. 

Overall I like this place for its beers but the food is underwhelming and overpriced. I think I'll just keep it to drinks next time."}
{"text":"Upon recommendation tried the BLTA sandwich and added an egg... It was Amazing! Also tried the lemongrass honeysuckle beer and it was yummy!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to the West side. My visit was to the taproom in the Old Litchfield Park area. On my first visit I had a sampler flight. My first impression is that this is a nice, quaint little tap room. Emphasis on little. They have eight taps of their own beers. A sampler flight of four was $8. A bit pricey but well within the norm it seems. I tried all three IPAs they had going at the time and the Chocolate Stout. Overall impressions-the beers seem well-made, no discernible production flaws, with a pretty broad rotation of styles. My personal preference tends to be for dry, clean, hoppy styles so my only reservation after my first visit is that even their hoppy-est recipes seem to be quite malt-forward. The IPAs were still hoppy but definitely skewed more towards the malt side than I generally prefer. The Haboob Black IPA seems to be a favorite and was my pick in the flight as well. I'll be back soon to try more and confirm if my initial impressions are accurate. Strictly in the name of science...
If you're in the area check them out."}
{"text":"As someone who has visits as many Arizona breweries as possible, I've seen quite a few. Peoria Artisan is a small (very small) brewery and taproom with only a few tables and bar. However, it is a very well kept and designed; cosy and pleasant little place to relax with a few beers. 

Since it was our time; we ordered a flight. We tried the IPArk; A very low-hoppy IPA but smooth and drinkable, my favorite. Paul's Pale Ale; smooth and tasty, bready tasting & second favorite. The Heritage Red Ale, which was surprisingly good because I normally don't like reds. And the Fields Forever, a strawberry wheat that had only a very very subtle strawberry hint to it. 

Overall, the place is very far from me so probably won't go out of my way to go back, but if I find myself nearby, I would absolutely duck in for a beer or two."}
{"text":"We LOVE Peoria Artisan Brewery! They have the best menu that changes seasonally! My favorite brunch menu item is the shrimp and grits. Last time we went there, I recently have become dairy free. The cook was able to special make me the grits dairy free when he overheard me talking to my husband disappointed. It was such a nice gesture! It is a great little brewery in the middle of Peoria. Great drinks. Great staff. Great food."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, but I've never taken the time to review until now. We stopped in last week on a Friday for an after work beer and appetizer with my wife. We always enjoy the beer here and the Sangria is A+ according to my wife (grab it before it runs out). The food is ok most days. It's not ever terrible, but I'm never left that impressed. We had the pretzel and dirty fries this time and like I mentioned, not bad but but left with a \"wow, give me more!\". With a name like Artisan, I know I should expect something fancy, but sometimes I wish they had more to pub like food. Like some kind of nachos or something. I feel like they try to be too fancy. For instance, I don't really want like an apple coleslaw as a side. The other thing and maybe biggest downfall at PAB though is service. It was fairly full for a Saturday around 5pm, but I'm certain there are only two waiters/waitresses. I just feel like they're never very attentive on checking to see if new beers are needed often or if we need anything else. I feel like I always have to wave them down as they quickly walk past the table. Overall, I do enjoy this place because of its close proximity to our home and the beer selection. I know we will be back, just wish these things were different is all."}
{"text":"Great selection for a nano brewery...double IPA is really good.  The best pretzels I have ever tasted.  Service was good one visit, outstanding next visit.  A+!"}
{"text":"Thank you for giving North Peoria a quality, cool, casual, well priced brewery/restaurant! I am not a big beer drinker, but enjoy hanging out here. Food is good, creative, consistent and visually appealing. Love the vibe, decor, staff. Well done!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Great choice of beers. Bartender was great. Live music on a Friday evening. Hostess told us there was a 30 min wait for a table for two. We waited outside for about 20 mins and a couple walked in and was seated right away. They were told that there was a 30 min wait as well, but the guy asked, \"What about the patio?\" to which she said, \" Oh sure\" and sat them right away. Why she didn't offer us the patio I'll never know?"}
{"text":"The beer was good, the service was terrible. Our beer sat at the bar as multiple staff walked up and down the room! Oh how good it WOULD have been if it were  actually been cold. The staff takes your credit card out of sight to the kitchen to process your check, WTH!! They're gone with your card for 10-15 min and you're left wondering what the the hell they're doing. And when questioned about it he says, \"it's because we use  an IPad\" well, WTH ? then bring it to the table! No introductions from the server, he brings your flight, spills it and then doesn't even come back to wipe it up! In general, it was just terrible service and we will not be back."}
{"text":"If you like craft beer brewed in house, you will be very pleased! I did enjoy the pigs ears, but feel the food menu needs more options. A must try spot along Lake Pleasant Pkwy!"}
{"text":"I keep hoping this place will get better and I can leave a positive review. I've been here 4 times each time ordering something different and having my guests also order different. We've now maxed out the menu. How can one restaurant suck at everything but the service.  The service is great the food is bizarre and horrible. I can digest interesting food if it tastes good but the food is horrible. Seriously $16 for a chicken leg! Wow I was in Italy and paid no where near those prices for great food. The beer needs a serious revamp it tastes like diesel fluid. The only  redeeming quality is the exceptional service.."}
{"text":"I give it 3 1/2 for brunch and beer.  Dinner menu is eh-order appetizers and you can't
go wrong.  Service is not awesome."}
{"text":"Our first visit here and we decided to try  a little bit of everything . We ordered the pretzel and beer cheese, the dirty fry bar and the mac and cheese with bacon...to start.
The mac and cheese was stellar! The dirty fries were super seasoned, super delicious and came with 4 sauces. The pretzel, well it was a typical soft pretzel.
We then ordered the the BLT with an egg, and a burger with swiss cheese, bacon and an egg. Both were fantastic!!
We ordered WAY too much food, but it was SO worth it! 
Can't wait to come back to try the pig ears and beer! 
We found our new favorite place!

Totally rolled out to the car by the way :)"}
{"text":"They have an extensive beer menu, but not so much for food.  We had the Happy Hour menu and each had a couple beers.  The Prickly Pear Wheat was very good.  The pretzel and chicken bites were good, but the deviled eggs were bland.  This is a cute little spot in Peoria.  There were a lot of mosquitoes inside, but they had outdoor seating too."}
{"text":"Great local brew house with a nice selection of beers, easy drinking at its finest. We ordered fried zucchini, chicken and biscuits, and the house burger; all were excellent and cooked to our liking. The service was fast and every question asked was answered quickly and correctly. The restaurant itself is clean and not too loud, I can definitely have a conversation using my \"indoor\" voice. Overall, I will be returning, perhaps on a live music night and when the weather is nice to take advantage of the outdoor patio.

P.S. - We celebrated my husband's birthday here and the complimentary fried PB&J was delicious."}
{"text":"I would rate this place a 5 star for the food and service. Very disappointed when I walked in on a Sunday and they were hosting a pottery painting class. I was not prepared for that. Maybe that's exactly the crowd they are looking for but i was not prepared to be surrounded by painters.

On any other time - the pig ears were terrific and service is wonderful! I'll be back on another day!"}
{"text":"Update..been here several. Ore times and the beer is getting better and more diverse. I believe they had 16 of their own beers and a few guest taps. That's why I go to breweries is to drink the beer they actually make and I love options so PAB has earned a 5 star review in my eye!"}
{"text":"It was our first time at PAB. A busy Friday night. Tables are close. Nice energy. My spouse had brined chicken. The brine was over salted. Enjoyed the burger and fries. Delicious. We will be back."}
{"text":"Small place for good happy hour prices that last for hours. They have a good looking menu even though we did not get any eats. They also have a child's selection but I did not feel it was a good place to go with kids. Their selection of their brews were ok and they did have a lot of various others to chose."}
{"text":"I haven't had a chance to try the food but the menu looks incredible and might just earn them that last star. Great service and even better beer selection. I am incapable of leaving without a growler filled with one of their amazing beers. If you are in the neighborhood I would highly recommend them and look for their discounts on Restaurants.com!"}
{"text":"The food was really good however, the space is very small and so when my friend and I arrived we had to wait quite awhile to be seated. Usually that is no problem however, there were several tables open. When I asked about those tables the hostess said they were for other people before us, and again that would have been totally OK, but they weren't actually seating anyone and there was only 1 other party of 2 before us. While we were waiting I heard a different server tell someone else they had to wait to be seated because the kitchen was behind. So why did the hostess tell us something different? I don't think they should makeup different reasons, if the kitchen is behind then just tell us the truth. It was odd and rubbed me the wrong way. We did get seated and again, the food was good, but was just an odd seating situation. Also, there was live music which I think is a bad choice for such a small space."}
{"text":"Simply thank you! This is a much needed establishment on the West side! Twenty brews on tap, 95% local and the food is a very pleasant addition! Had bottomless chips with aioli, brew master salad with their IPA dressing and wings....all amazing and made from scratch! Wings meaty, chips flavorful and salad (who brags about salad?) just try it. You're welcome. Oh yes, they have Sunday brunch starting at 10am so more rave reviews to come I'm sure, stay tuned! I'm told bloody Mary bar, mimosas - yes they have wine as well - and again made from scratch - can't wait! Service spot-on as well, catch 22 reporting this as I do NOT want to share!"}
{"text":"Another year visiting AZ for spring training and wanted to find a brewery. This was perfect. The burger and beer Wednesday special is a great deal. The Scotch Egg just spicy enough and the Beers are very good. Loved the Savannah Marie and gotta love a Peanut Butter lager. Krystal was fantastic. She was informative and honest about menu and beer selections. I want to go back now!"}
{"text":"Second time came with out of town friends.  The beer is good. But I have to say I am disappointed in the food.  My hub had the French dip and it was pretty small for the price.  The flavor wasn't too bad. But the presentation wasn't great at all.  I had loaded fries they were meh ok.  Not fantastic.  The chicken dinner was ate by a friend and it wasn't good at all he regretted not returning it.  Just tired and hungry so he didn't wanna deal with it.  Would I come again ummm for a beer yeah sure but not to eat. Slower service but friendly folks."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place! My husband and I went at 8:20 on a Wednesday night. It wasn't crowded at all because they close at 9... I always feel bad doing that. They let us seat ourselves so we chose a comfy corner booth. The decor is really cool with wood panels on the walls and big glass windows to see the brews in process. 

We ordered a flight of beer, BLT, and PAB burger. The fries were not very good and the BLT was nothing special. The burger was good though, with the soft bun and yummy sauce. 

This place is a cool spot because of the decor and vibe but I wouldn't go back for the food I tried. Maybe I didn't try the right thing? If I went back, it would be to hang out with friends and I would order an app and drink."}
{"text":"Great food and beer, went here with my hubby and enjoyed some laid back music. The location is in North Peoria, food is excellent beer is wonderful."}
{"text":"So disappointed. We come here at least once a week and normally we enjoy our time, the beer, and the food. We were seated by the host and sat at the table for 10 minutes with NO service. 3 servers walked right by us multiple times and did not offer to help us at all. The same thing happened last Saturday night to us as well- but we decided it was probably a one time thing, so we decided to return to our local watering hole and give them the benefit of the doubt. We usually love this place, but tonight your service, or lack there of, really turned us off."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and lighting. Food was very exceptional and the mood was comfortable. Very classy and enjoyed our time. Our Georgia family enjoyed every minute of it. Must come here Y'all"}
{"text":"A real find for us westsiders, The beer is amazing and staff is friendly and excited to be there. give it a try!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the atmosphere is always great. Live music on the weekends is a big draw and the staff is always friendly and accommodating. This is one of the few brewery-style restaurants on this end of town, but it definitely doesn't offer anything you wouldn't be able to get elsewhere. The beer is served in the world's smallest glasses and the food relies heavily on fillers like rice. Prices are high for the quality of food you receive. Probably won't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Slow service, yes, but the beer and the food were quite good. This would be a 5 star review if the service was fast. The outdoor patio was nice and pet friendly. Water misters made it feel cool even on a hot summer evening. Friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"First time here yesterday. We went in for the daily happy hour (yes, happy hour on a Saturday!). Had one of the waiters/cooks drop a cup of ketchup on me while bringing out some fries. No big deal, accidents happen and the staff brought out towels and napkins to help me clean off my shirt. Immediately we had someone over at our table apologizing while giving us a 15% discount on the entire bill and comp'd a couple of items. We didn't expect this but it was GREAT customer service for something that was a total accident. 

We had an English pale ale that was on point and the peachy keen mixed drink instantly became a favorite. There were 4 of us so we tried quite a few things. The PAB wings, salt and pepper fries, pretzel, PAB chicken bites and left coast club won't do you wrong. A few more tv's in this place and it would be our go-to for football season. Will definitely be back to support our local brewery!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, and good selection of draft beers and food. The pretzel was great, as was the PAB burger. First time we stopped into this restaurant and we're pleased we did. We'll definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Peoria Artisan, first with Brewery Hop. We decides to arrive a little early and eat lunch. The PAB burger was better than I remembered and the pulled pork waffles were surprisingly delicious, I could order both again. As for the beer, I either really liked it or didn't really care for it. The ones I liked were Savannah marie IPA, Nades revenge, and Lake Pleasant. Being that they are 4 years old I would expect more from the beer but given some of their recent changes it seems that quality is improving. I would still encourage trying all of their beer."}
{"text":"Best Brew house in the area. Finally some worth while establishments opening up in the west valley.. Plus they love my dogs and let me hang out with them on the patio  The burgers are fantastic and if you haven't tried the short rib/ polenta dish you are really missing out!"}
{"text":"Being from Colorado, I have been searching for a long time for a great microbrewery in Arizona that compares to what I used to frequent at home. And finally that search as ended. A spectacular beer selection - you can't go wrong especially with any of the IPAs. A cool, cozy place with a friendly staff and amazing beer? What more do you need?! Reasonable prices with a variety of food options also add to the experience. A must try for beer lovers from both sides of the valley. Well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite spot in the North Peoria area. The husband and I frequent here whether it's for dinner or just to stop in at the bar or patio for a beer. The food is always amazing and I love how they change up the menu. The local beer is really good as well. The husbands favorite is the Savannah Marie IPA."}
{"text":"Smaller then normal portions with average food. Overpriced as well ($60ish for 4 beers, one burger that we split, and one appetizer that we split). We left hungry and disappointed. I was hoping for better, but I'll also give it another try and hope they improve."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have another brewery nearby and my experience was pretty good. The space is cute, the staff was friendly and attentive.  I had the southern man burger, which was pretty delicious - very juicy and cheesy! My friend chose the fish and chips. The fish tasted great, but the breading/batter didn't stay on and became very soggy. We tried multiple beers, I believe we had 2 flights of beer, so we had a big variety. Overall, their beers were pretty good, but I can't recall any of them that I thought were amazing or unique. So I wouldn't go back for specifically for their beers, but I would return for food."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so bad. My group came in July 1st on a friend's suggestion. When we arrived, there was one other group seated. We were quickly given menus, after about 15 minutes the bartender came over. When he asked my group if we were one check or separate (there was 7 of us), we said separate. He said, \"oh, then you'll have to wait for the server.\"  The server came over 15 minutes later and simple said, \"do you know what you want to eat and drink?\"  We were ready, so my group started ordering food and drinks. He was highly confused when some people ordered flights, and told us \"I only work Saturday & Sunday, they are always changing the numbers.\"  He never brought the sodas ordered, my friends had to go to the bar to get those, as well as refills. Having food allergies, I told him what I wanted to eat, to which he told me, \"that's too much to write/type, I'm just going to give you the kids burger.\" Totally get it, but his delivery was so condescending, I could tell he didn't want to bother with me. He continued to be absent for the rest of our meal. When it came time to pay, he brought 2 checks, then 3, the last 2 people had to ask again for their check. I could tell he wanted ya to just get out of there. The food was yummy. It's a shame the service doesn't make me want to come back.u"}
{"text":"A perfect recipe for success. A small but comfortable brewery with super nice staff, an impressive food menu, (the burger kicks ass) and a beer list to meet the needs of even the most serious beer connoisseur. 20 or so beer selections include 7 or 8 brewed on site and an impressive line up of guest beers. Lumberyard, 8 bit, sleepy dog, North mountain brewing. There all there. Awesome way to share local brews. Be sure to bring a growler. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Small place but not worth the drive as a destination spot to visit. Sandwiches are priced more than Subways and offer fewer choices but tasted fine. Have 8 taps but only had 4 beers on.  Beers were priced reasonably but really tasted like mediocre homebrew instead of artisinal craft beer. The oatmeal stout was sickly sweet for a stout and was marked 5 IBU's. It was clean and should do well out there even with the limited menu and mediocre beer as there is certainly nothing else around to compete with."}
{"text":"Great selection of PAB ales as well as thoughtful selection of guest beers. I tried a flight of hopped up PAB beer and all were great quality. Eclectic menu offerings makes me want to come back to eat. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  Got to meet the owner Matt who was very pleasant and it was obvious he is passionate about the brewery.  Absolutely a destination for any hophead in northern Arizona. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Thought I would finally give this place a try....the server I don't know his name because he never told us was a younger Asian guy not too friendly just blah didn't seem excited about his job....but I was excited to see a Monte cristo on the menu cooked the way I like and not deep fried....the sandwich comes with a jalapeno blueberry jam which is amazing...the sandwich and fries were awesome...we also got the pretzel appetizer and that came with 2 excellent sauces...a horseradish mustard and a beer Chz. I'm not a beer drinker so I can't comment on that part."}
{"text":"Friendly & knowledgeable staff, great apps & adorable patio dining so close to home, luv it"}
{"text":"My husband LOVES the craft beer selections - he is what people would call a \"beer snob\" so you know it must be approved.  The brewery also carries other AZ beers on tap so you can try something from other local brewery's.  The owner gave us a really neat & informative tour of the brew room. The food is good - we have had the hamburger, the mac n cheese bites & the chicken sandwich but I'm sure everything is good. Would definitely recommend this if you haven't gone yet."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great food and even better drinks! Customer service was top notch. Will visit again for sure!"}
{"text":"Industrial casual with a nice view of tanks from the bar as well as a big window behind the bar so you can look out at some mts. Would like to go back on a good sunset night since I bet it would be a nice view. I liked the logical numbering of the beers on the chalkboard list to coincide with the listing in the menu and then when numbered in chalk on the flight board. However, they are not listed by the same number in the handy laminated beer guide (remember to ask to see it as they are placed handily) with its well written descriptions, so it was not as easy to find them, and surprisingly the ABVs were not listed there either, and the book was not up-to-date. Pretzel was partially burned and nothing exceptional esp. for the reg. price of $8, but the mustard sauce and fondue sauce were tasty. The usual prices, esp. for their own beer could stand to come down esp. during non-happy hours. The menu was limited but I was told it will be reworked soon when summer is over. Our bartender was knowledgable about the beers. I especially liked that some beers are Historical Brews as it was fascinating to read the background info. I'd go again but only for specials or with a Groupon."}
{"text":"From the other reviews, I was surprised when I walked in.  Describing the décor as minimalist would be an understatement.  Stark, barren would be more accurate.  It did appear clean.  The beer was good, but there is no shortage of good beer in this town.  I can get that at the grocery store or Total Wine.  Yelp categorized this as a gastro pub.  What a misnomer.  I ordered a BLT.  It took a long time to get served.  I thought, well, they are frying the bacon, it'll be nice and crisp and I'll have a great sandwich.  What a disappointment.  It did have lots of bacon, soggy bacon.  It looked like that really cheap food service bacon you see in plastic sheets that is already separated into strips and already partially cooked.  It appeared to have been microwaved not fried on the grill to finish the cooking.  The cook (a description that is a major exaggeration I suspect) micro sliced the tomato and it was your typical under-ripe, supermarket tomato.  A complete waste of $7.  I won't go here again."}
{"text":"I like this brewery just to grab a beer or something, service can be slow, especially considering the low traffic the few times I have been here... they lean more towards hoppy beers it seems, maybe it's just a summer thing. But the staff is friendly, and they do some of the brewing on site which is cool. They had an excellent Oktoberfest with live music and full sized steins, which was pretty cool! They recently expanded their food menu and everything looks really good."}
{"text":"This is about my 5th time here. Typically I go during the afternoon with no crowd and service is ok. 

I don't know what happened but the girl behind the bar is overwhelmed.  I sat for 5 minutes with no beer while she worked right in front of me chatting with her boyfriend.  Finally she asked as a new couple came in and sat down next to me. Then food was ordered so she was now non existent again but another girl showed up to help. At least that's what I thought.  As the 1st girl is getting food orders completed. The second girl is doing what ever. I didn't see her pour a beer or make food.  Meanwhile I'm out of beer again and just getting aggravated. Two servers.  Only about 15 people in the whole place and nobody pays attention to the customers. I guess multitasking is something of the past. The first girls boyfriend ends up sitting by me at the bar. Good thing!  She at least payed attention to him and served him with a water before asking the paying customers if they needed anything.  Thank god he was next to me or it would have been like pulling teeth to get my check. I rather stay in Glendale and go to dubina.  This was a far drive for subpar service despite them having very good beer. It's unfortunate that they can't find decent help or a better system to cook."}
{"text":"My husband and I live in WestWing (about 10 minutes driving from PAB) and every single time we visit, we fall more in love with this place! The food is always excellent, the staff personable, and my husband really enjoys the varieties of brew. As someone who tries to eat healthy, there is always something for me (recently the spaghetti squash was added and is now my fave!). The Growler Club perks are true perks and the live entertainment (on certain days) is always above par and enjoyable! This is by far, our most favorite place in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My sons steak salad was so greasy he couldn't eat it plus his medium steak was rare. the Brussels sprouts were not cooked enough and they too were greasy. Out of 6 of us no one cared for their meal. They didn't come back with water and tried to rush us out, I know they close at 8;00 on Sunday but it was quarter till."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere .. Garden patio pet friendly too. The deviled eggs are great and the burger too . There are some things on the menu I would love to try but I'm a little scared to try . I wish they had a sampler plate so I don't have to order each one alacart . Beers a super great too. The breakfast is nice just want a few more choices is all for lunch and breakfast .. Great overall xxxxx"}
{"text":"Food was ok, not great and a little cold.  Staff was very friendly but service is very slow and disorganized.  You can tell they are still working out the kinks.  We will go back and try just the bar and maybe a pretzel.  Don't go if you are on a schedule."}
{"text":"Wow, food was good but surprised that they charged me to add more tonic water to an existing drink that was too strong.  Disappointing they did not state that before adding the tonic water (2 dollars).  I recommend the place just ask the price before ordering."}
{"text":"The limited amount of food that they offer is more than made up by how good what they have is. The reason you head here is for the differing varietals of local beers. I'm not a beer connoisseur in any way shape or form but I've taken to letting the servers make suggestions. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and an even better tasting IPA.  They've got some of the best craft beer on the westside."}
{"text":"Been there twice.  Its new, so its busy - which is good and bad, as you may have to wait a while if you show up when its busy.  Beers have been good, only a handful on draft from Peoria Artisan at this time, but a bunch guests on tap (majority are local brews).  Overall, good experience with the food.  I expected more from my burger, but all of it seems high quality.  Staff has been great, on top of things and knowledgeable.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good beer, GREAT food. 

Server was attentive despite the large needy table he acquired. 

Unfortunately, one hole bathrooms are not adequate when serving beer.  It's enough to make me think twice about returning.  Despite the great food."}
{"text":"Food is good but the portions are too small. Ordered the dirty fries and was not enough to share. Also they had live music and was so loud could not have a conversation with the party. Suggest they lower the music and increase the portions. Overall all nice place and tasty food"}
{"text":"Update: have gone a few more times since my review after our first couple visits. I would say that service has greatly improved and now that I got over that... Love the Charcuterie plate! Let's keep it strong. Oh yeah, glad there is a heffe on the list now...for my wife. #shehateshopps

Very disappointed. Was excited to have a local brewery to go to. The Red IPA was good and the food was also good. However, the service has been very slow and inconsistent. I also think the lighting is too bright. I don't mean to be picky, but it feels like a chain. I was so looking forward to having a local Gastropub to go to, but service is so bad it's back to breweries and restaurants far from the house."}
{"text":"Was here about a year ago and had a lackluster experience...what a difference a year can make! Met a friend and sat at the bar.  Had a burger and fries and sampled a few of the beers.  Wow! Tried the Haboob IPA and a new beer that was just tapped today, the Honeysuckle Amber.  Both were delicious as well as the scratch made burger!  The staff was super friendly and made sure the entire experience was great!  Special shout out to the bartender, Mike, and the brewer, Bret, who stopped by to chat about the beers.  I will definitely be making future trips into this local establishment.  Nice job turning it around!"}
{"text":"If you like a variety of created brews and great food.  This is the place.  Never disappointed with the options and choices."}
{"text":"A great little place with industrial chic decor, good brews and delicious food. High points of the meal were the tender and moist battered chicken bites, clearly freshly made, a really good Caesar salad, again, no bottled dressing for these guys, lovely smoky charred romaine salad, perfectly cooked Norwegian salmon served on a bed of garlicky sautéed spinach with tomatoes and pineapple. The dessert of rhubarb crisp was not the best. It was very thick and pasty, possibly because too much flour was used to thicken and had a powdery dry topping, but the ice cream made with beer was light in texture and subtle in taste.  This is a great place and I'm thrilled to have them in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"The southern man burger is the best I have ever had! The cheese and the gooeyness, the burger is always cooked so good. Makes my mouth salivate just writing this!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. I have been coming here every couple weeks... The reason is every time I come there is a brand new beer menu. If you come here do their flights. You get to try many different beers for reasonable price. Their burger is out of this world, it is so good. The fries that come with it are amazing too. They also have live music some nights. It's a great place to come and relax and have a good time with your friends. Great food. Clean. Amazing staff. Just an all around great place. If you have not been here yet you need to stop on by, ask for Bre see is awesome."}
{"text":"Beer here is solid. Food is meh. The sandwiches are buried in mayo, the mustard tastes like...nothing really. The burger is great, but a greasy bun makes you have to wipe after every bite. I'd come for the beer and pretzel, but eat first next time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place  It's close to our house so it's a bummer I don't have a great review. We sat outside, although it had been warmer that week, that day was chilly and breezy so we asked if they could put on a heater they had outside. They informed us the put the tanks away... Where? I guess somewhere way too difficult to get back out... Our server was very, very enthusiastic, and seemed in a bad mood. The food took forever... We ordered the deviled eggs appetizers do that took 25min. We ordered our food at the same time, and it came 45min from the time we ordered it. My husband burger was well overcooked, the kids burgers were barely warm, and our muscles,  the broth was barely warm although it was in a castor on bowl  that you would think would be steaming hot, it was not. We won't be coming here again, although the beer was good, but really can you messed that up..."}
{"text":"I made the trip out here from Arcadia on Sunday so that I could experience some west side beer scene over the weekend. This was stop number one, after reading all the positive food reviews, I was pretty excited to check it out and sample their beer offerings. 

Plenty of parking in an easy to find strip mall, when you walk in the place is smaller than what it seems on the outside, with a bar that only seats a handful but the décor is nice, rustic and modern mix and I got a seat at a booth near the back in no time. The brunch/Sunday menu was great - tons of options for pretty good prices - around 10-15 for everything. I went for the shrimp and grits because I'm a nice southern girl and that dish was actually AWESOME. My friend had the burger and seemed to like it ok, but my dish was a huge winner and a nice big portion for the price. 

Now the beer and the reason why this place doesn't get a better review. Lets just say, there is a lot in need of work here. I'd been to the Litchfield taproom the year before and thought the same thing, but we wanted to be open minded so ordered 3 flights in order to sample 12 of their beers. Of all 12, we only finished 2 of the tasters. The Savannah Marie IPA is far and away the best beer on the menu, although the Red and Black IPAs weren't too bad. The Peanut Butter Porter - another beer they're known for - was odd. Maybe just a bad batch, but tasted like raw peanut powder and was really thin. That was a disappointment as I remember that being a standout at beer fests I've attended in the past. The Amber and Scottish Ale seemed to be mediocre, weird finishes to those. The NW IPA was particularly bad, no nose on it and really tasted like sad hop water. We actually had a conversation about the strange off-flavors in that beer and a few others, wondering how they treated their water there. Overall though, this is not the kind of beer I want to be drinking and did nothing to break my east-side bias when it comes to the Phoenix craft beer scene. The worst part - they charged a LOT for those flights. Granted, they are bigger pours, but since we finished almost none of them and even mentioned to the waitress the poor reviews, you'd hope you didn't end up paying $2.75 for all 12 tasters. 

If I found myself in Peoria again for some reason and I was hungry, I'd go back - the food is really good especially the brunch.  Maybe order a craft cocktail though and skip out on the beers."}
{"text":"Disappointing, as I had the sense this place was too clever by half.

Issue one - while there were more than a dozen beer choices, there was not a single hefeweisen available. I can't be the only person who prefers to drink a hefe.

Issue two - after finally settling on the next-best option for someone who does not want to use a knife and fork on my beer (Boardwalk kolsch), I was told that it was not part of the happy hour specials because it wasn't one of the brewery's craft selections.

Issue three - after settling for option three, a Belgian tippel, it was served in what appeared to be a brandy snifter. I understand this is \"craft\" beer but it's still beer, not scotch. 12ish ounces for $5 plus dollars on happy hour is outrageous.

Issue four - the menu is thin. As I couldn't shake my disappointment on the beer, we ordered the brewery pretzel. Can't go wrong with a pretzel. Except the beer cheese fondue had an unusual, unsettling flavor - sort of a liquid version of Doritos. As I said, too clever by half.

The elements are there, including a great patio that isn't hindered by backing to the Lake Pleasant Parkway and driveway to the Walmart at the heart of this shopping center. But the patio can't make up for huge miss on everything else."}
{"text":"Nice place to go with friends. Chicken pot pie is good by not very big. Don't order pig ears."}
{"text":"Awesome Neighborhood Brewery!! Owner Neil is awesome and friendly. Ask for him to say HI! Great selection of beer and good atmosphere. Always people to talk too and staff if awesome! Will keep coming back! Spread the word on this place :)  Neil all I ask is maybe open later on weekends!! But other then that we love the place!!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday at around 4:30 website listed Happy Hour Sunday 4-7. Waitress said they quit doing Sunday Happy Hour about a month ago but since it was still on website they would honor it. Ordered our food which was presented beautifully but tasted very average. I had the Kentucky chicken and biscuits with gravy, chicken was nice and crispy outside but under cooked inside, husband had monte cristo, the ham was dry and tough. When we got our bill we also let them know we should get the BlueGreen discount. When we paid our bill it did show the blue green discount but not the happy hour discounts when we questioned her she said it was on there but prices were the same as on menu. Beer was good though."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday after church. We were seated right away but then waited forever for a server. Just when we were about to give up, our server arrived and she was great. I had a mimosa and he had a Bloody Mary because Sunday. The mimosa was heavy on the OJ and light on champagne. The Bloody Mary was fine, a little tomatoey. The food was mixed. My veggie hash was mushy without any carmelization that would have made it rock. His pulled pork and waffles were nice. The side of bacon was excellent. The pigs ears were omg! But the hash browns promised on the menu could not be delivered. Overall was just okay."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to try this place after looking at the menu online as I am not one to try food that is \"different\" but was told I wouldn't regret it, especially since I am a nut of a beer snob. 
We ordered the chicken wings with the run instead of the usual wing sauce and I was very impressed. I will continue to order those. 
I also got the chorizo burger which was every bit as good as the wings. 
For beer I had a few gingerbreads which are an obvious seasonal and had a nice mix of flavors and tastes. I also had their IPA which was tasty and not another overly hoppy IPA that tries to overpower your taste buds into thinking it is good. I got a crowler to go and will be back as often as I can, although a 2017 resolution for me ha no beer for 100 days. 99 to go."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place!  Great food, awesome beers and very friendly staff!  The patio area is so relaxing - one of my favorite places to be!  Also, they frequently have live music - hard to find in this part of town.  Be sure to try the PAB burger!"}
{"text":"Love the beer.  Pretzel and cheese sauce is amazing.  Great variety of beer.  Favorite new pub to hang out at.  Good service as well!! Already looking forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"What an awesome, awesome place in a neighborhood that's growing faster than weeds! I truly wish this place had been around when I live here, but now I know exactly where I will be when I visit my parents. Local brews from places like Four Peaks, you can do samplers, and their food is good too. (side note - the rhubarb dessert is VERY sour). Also because it's AZ.... PATIO TIME!"}
{"text":"This is by far our fav hang out!!!!! everything we have tried here is top notch! Beers are fantastic and all the food is DE Lish!!! Try the \"dirty fries\"  the BEST!!!! This place is soooooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the cute, inviting exterior fool you. This place is an overpriced, hipster brewery that doesn't deliver. We ordered the hot pretzel and it came out burnt and hard as a rock. My boyfriend ordered the French dip. It was dry as can be, which they tried to cover up with tons of horseradish. My Left Coast Club had no flavor. We don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Great service, quiet, cool music, smooth vibe without any pretentiousness. This place is spot on!  The beer is excellent, the food is delicious, and it does not feel like you are anywhere near Wal-mart."}
{"text":"For now I'll rate this place a 3. Service hasn't been great, the ladies working aren't very good at welcoming people as they walk in, I and probably about 10 other people arrived unwelcomed in the last 35 minutes. As someone who has been in hospitality, it's a big thing for me and I expect to be greeted everywhere I visit, it's a sign of good service. You get a welcome at first sight and you'll be more relaxed if service is not up to par. 

I waited about 5 min before anyone even noticed I sat down at the bar. I requested a menu and then wanted a sample & that took about 10 min or so. The girl filled up a big order for the outside patio while I had simply requested a small sample. I could have had the sample while she was finishing up and then able to order. But oh well, maybe I'm just being nit picky. Things just seem to be like they're still getting their grove going. Working out the kinks and getting it running smoothly will be key for this place. They have a ton of potential and I plan to come back and I hope it's a better experience. I love breweries and we need some on this side of town.

While I was here I had the Rosemary frites, the garlic aioli is awesome with them! Yum! I also had 3 beers, artisan Amber- it was ok, Savannah Marie IPA- very good & hoppy, & the HunnyHal Honey Jelpeno- also very good and creative!  I'll look forward to coming back for more beers. They seem to offer flights but I didn't see it on the menu, it must be something to ask for.

I hope to review again at a higher star rating! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Consistently solid beers and the uniqueness of this small place is much of the charm. Staff is always friendly and ready to help explain. I prefer this place over another local place and will support them 100% as they truly care about the quality of their beer and the happiness of their customers!"}
{"text":"Really tasty menu and some funky beers. I'd recommend the deviled eggs, and the burger.  The fries are good too, and they have music some weekends. The dining room is small, but the patio faces west and makes for great sunsets, and the bar window opens to let a nice breeze in when there is one. 

I'd recommend the Scottish Ale, they typically have 20 beers-a-brewing, so even beer simpletons like me can find something they like. Take your beer friends here to impress!"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour last Friday to have a beer and snacks. We went with a flight of 4 6oz. beers consisting of the Lake Pleasant PA, Push Mower Blonde, Haboob IPA, and Honeysuckle Street Amber. The Honeysuckle and Haboob we enjoyed, the other two not as much. I'll admit I wasn't highly impressed with the beer here.

To go with our beer, we shared the fried pig ears and Pab burger which were both pretty good and just the right amount of food. A whole burger would have left me feeling very full."}
{"text":"Kinda neither here nor there about this place.  I've stopped in twice on my visits to AZ, and it's been fine both times.  The beers are just okay for me, but the patio is nice.  Haven't had the food, so can't speak on that.  

The best beer I had on my recent visit was a guest tap, which was a truer to style NE IPA than their own that was on tap that day."}
{"text":"This brewery has been open for approximately three months and we understand why they were empty and the Tailgaters sports bar next door was full. The service was pathetic and unwelcoming. We understand that we arrived two hours before closing, but that's no reason for my food to come out cold and altered due to not having certain items. The best part was the staff would continuously fill glasses of beer and go to the kitchen. We won't seen them for a while and when they came back out they would sit in an empty chair and kick their feet up on another chair. The staff was on their cell phone and having inappropriate conversations with one another. All we wanted was to try a new place and drink good beer. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Wishing this was closer to home so I can walk to and from since they do such a great job at lushing me up, never fails. They have such great selection of beers. Foods ok too but DO NOT HAVE THE THE SALTY APPETIZER CHICHARRONES OR PORK RINDS whatever they're called.  They are grossly salty. Like bad bad. All else is ok here. Service nice. Prices reasonable as ambiance is always chill."}
{"text":"This place has awesome beer hands down. There is a craft brew on tap for everyone and definitely satisfies the \"hopheads\". Excellent food as well. Neal, the owner/brewer talks about his beer with you while you drink it and he has certainly created an ideal little craft brewery! Best local brews around."}
{"text":"Highly recommended.  Only tried the Scotch ale, which was very well done, but the food alone would have been worth the trip. Excellent salad with fresh ingredients and flavor, and one of the best burgers I've had anywhere, accompanied by perfectly done fries. Super friendly staff - the chef saw me checking out the brewing area and gave me a quick tour. Go for the food, stay for the beer!"}
{"text":"Great beer, great burgers! Beer flights are much bigger than the flights at other restaurants, so I would recommend sharing a flight between 2 people so there isn't any waste. We did try some Mac and cheese bites appetizer that was just ok. Other than that, it was an enjoyable experience. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah!,  this place lives up to the hype.   We were in town and were looking for a bite and good beer, and found both here.   The food was very good and the service also was very good.  My server was also very knowledgeable and helpful when it came to picking and describing the different brews.  Also thought it was way cool that they had outside dining for those who bring their dog.  Definitely will return on our next trip to AZ."}
{"text":"Really pretty good. First time last night with wife. Had pretzel and cheese, a blta and a burger. All were excellent and all freshly cooked. Also had one of their beers, Push Mower. Very light, clean and tested great. All in all a very good find in the culinary desert that is northwest Peoria. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Finally a brewery in North Peoria. Nice spot
to hang out and have some beers. I was here on opening weekend, so they only had 1 of their beers on tap, but they had a great selection of local beers. I look forward to coming back and trying more of their beers. The food is just ok, nothing too special about it. You can probably find better food for a better price elsewhere. Hoping to see a better menu in the future."}
{"text":"WARM  BEER!!!  and I tried 3 different ones my wife wouldn't even drink hers... The menu was strange very few per say normal choices very skimpy on the french Fries overall not good experience won't go back... Sad because they have a good selection of beers..."}
{"text":"Excellent beer! We tried the Savannah Marie IPA and Nade's Revenge and had the French Dip sandwich and Scotch Egg and Pickle Jar. All excellent. Friendly and helpful server. Also recommend the Blackberry Thyme Out cocktail!"}
