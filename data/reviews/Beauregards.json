{"text":"Grecian Tips - Marinated pork tenderloin with onions & green peppers over rice - 10.50

I visited this restaurant several years ago and got really good service and delicious food. Great steak. 

However, I stopped by today on my way to work for a carryout lunch. Since it had been a while since I visited, I asked a few questions about items on the menu. The person taking my order seemed bothered when I asked questions, for example about what kind of lettuce is used in the salad (iceberg); relatively simple questions. No real problem, I understand people have other things on their minds at times.

Sadly, my dish was as flavorless as possible and rather oily. I had a container of rice and very sparse pieces of not marinated pork tenderloin. I'm not a hard cookie to sell, but this was not even close to being a decent meal. Not even good for an eight dollar lunch special."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant twice. The first time I had the prime rib and it was great. Second time I had the lemon pepper wings and they were great. I haven't actually sat in and had dinner, both orders were to go. The management and staff seem to be very friendly. I will continue to dine at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best, place seems kind of dirty. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. The food is great and prices even better. My faves are the reuben, blackened prime rib, buffalo chicken sandwich and their wings. All those items are under 10.00. Tuesday drafts are 2.00. I would like to see an expanded beer selection but that is my only complaint. It is a 'Dallas Cowboys' bar so I would not recommend days when they play. Go Panthers!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here a few years ago and their food was good. Went there 2 weeks ago and it was horrible. i got the ribeye steak dinner and my fiancee got the ribeye steak sandwich, they were super thin, no seasoning not even salt and pepper, the steak was super tough and was reminiscent of those frozen steaks in a box the one could get at Walmart. Not sure what happened to this restaurant but it has seriously gone down hill."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday.....but
Food...bland
Service...slow n bad
Show....ok
But not worth that much money......."}
{"text":"My mom and I ate lunch here. We ordered the hamburger steak and the baked ziti. These both came with salads, and a very small bit of dressing. We asked for more. When the food arrived it seemed fresh. I took one bite of my ziti and it was full (and I mean full) of pepper. I like spicy foods, but expect a pasta dish with a red sauce not to be completely full of pepper-not a good spice just pure black pepper. It was not eatable. My mom's food seemed to be average, except her garlic bread was soaked with the juices (blood and all) from her steak. So, the waitress said she'd take our debit card-she didn't bring a check. When she comes back with the receipt it's about $5 higher than what we thought...so we ask for an itemized ticket (which we never got before paying) After 10 min she brings back a receipt-turns out they charged us 1.00 for extra ranch dressing and for 2 sodas -we ordered water. We were refunded for the soda. So, I probably won't be back for a while. Here's a tip, if you do decide to go here..watch your bill, don't order the baked ziti, and bring your own salad dressing. As for me, I think we will be eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place for seems to be forever, and just recently I started to stop in and pay local business owners some respect and also give them some business, the staff is always so nice, tons of food for great prices, sure I can dissect something, hell being in the same service industry we can always find something better to improve on, like I would do things this way, and why don't you serve this with that, but hey this works for them, it keep ls the doors open and to be honest I'm very happy with the food and service....I live the wings and things so keep doing well and great job"}
{"text":"Murder Mystery Review:

My date and I had discount tickets to Beauregard's Murder Mystery performance.  For the price (even after the discount) I expected it to be much more entertaining than it was.  This was my first time to Beauregard's, but not my first time to a dinner theater-type performance.  The food:  We were served a house salad (no choice of dressing) choice of: prime rib, chicken pasta, or baked ziti.  My date and I had the prime rib and baked ziti, which wasn't that great (for $29 a plate) also, it was cold by the time it was served.  Others at our table had the chicken pasta, which looked better than our entree choices.  A compliment:  the beer and wine prices were reasonable at 3.95 a glass for wine.

The show:  I had been to one of these shows once before, and it was excellent, therefore I have something to compare it to.  In comparison, the murder mystery show was amateurish.  It is very much an \"improv group.\"  It looked as if maybe they had trouble filling some spots, and rounded up some High School theater students.  

The restaurant was packed, and for the price paid, I expected more.  More could have been done with the set/costumes, audience etc.  Definitely do not pay full price for this show, I'm sure there are other dinner shows out there."}
{"text":"Low quality food!  I've been here twice with coworkers who insisted on coming \"because they are never crowded.\" Of course not, the food is awful.  The first time I ordered potato skins and a turkey sandwich. The potato skins were dry over cooked and it looked like half a strip of American cheese was melted on them- yuck! The lunch meat on the turkey was slimy.  The second time I went, I figured I'd get the chicken tenders and fries- can't mess that up, right?  Wrong! My meal was disgusting, the chicken tenders weren't even real chicken meat from a chicken breast, it was...processed chicken, that cheap crap made from chicken pieces and other stuff smooshed together.  Our waitress was nice though."}
{"text":"I arrived to see 2 kitchen workers in aprons unloading food from the trunk of a car. One was smoking as he unloaded and was walking in and out of the kitchen. 
Against my better judgement, I stayed to eat as I was meeting a group of friends. 
The service was poor and extremely slow. I think the server was the only one working the dining area! It took 10 min to get a beer and we finally asked for pitchers of tea and water since we couldn't seem to get refills in a reasonable amount of time. 
When we were finally able to order food, we were disappointed in the quality, especially for the price.  My fried shrimp was obviously from a frozen bag and I never did get my cole slaw. The $17 ribeye came out full of gristle. When my friend sent it back, they still charged her for it instead of the meal she got after that was edible. I could go on and on. After never receiving the coffee that was ordered at the end of the meal we said our goodbyes to Beauregards and will never go back."}
{"text":"So something weird to begin our visit.... While our waitress was taking our order, someone from the kitchen brought out a platter of food for another table and set it down at an empty table next to us. She stopped taking our order to get the food to the right table, then came back and finished taking our order. I have never experienced that in any restaurant before.

We ordered the Cheesy Chicken, blackened chicken breast, and the grilled pork chops. We waited for our food for at least 30 minutes. It didn't disappoint, the food pretty good. My party of four was happy with there entr√©e s for the most part. Pretty decent for the price. 

The service did leave something to be desired though, our waitress brought our bill and came back a few minutes later to ask us if the bill was separate, it was and she frowned at us. Her next words were and I quote, \"let me make sure my number is on here cause y'all are paying up front\". She didn't want to split the bill and allow us to pay from the table! 

She then came back a few minutes later to clear plates, I was eating my bread and potatoes and asked if I was done as I was about take a bite and took my plate. I gave it to her and said, I am now done, thanks. We left after that!

Needless to say this was not my favorite!"}
{"text":"I adore Beauregard's.  Their grilled chicken salad is huge, fresh and filling, overloaded with hot, juicy, quality chicken strips.  The Reuben is great.  Today I had the lasagne bc my friend was getting it and I didn't want entree envy.  The cheese was melty and prolific. The sauce was flavorful and tart, and the meat had a great flavor too. Better than what I make at home!  I love the Turkish waiter who often sings, very personable.  Worth a trip to the West Side!!!!"}
{"text":"Shit service and shit food. Wont return, took 20 to see a sever and another 45 to see food"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Service was excellent.  We ordered ribs and steak.  The only side dish I didn't like were the mixed vegetables."}
{"text":"This place was good the food that I ordered was pretty good I just wish that it wasn't so dark inside the lighting was poor but that doesn't take away from the fact that the food was good! I did order a baked potato to go one time and on my way out I forgot about it and I still think about it often LOL"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in they make you feel like your home. Very welcoming staff, lots of refills, they don't rush you out the door, in that aspect, I would give them 4 stars. 

However, food is the most important thing to review in my opinion. Unfortunately after eating here 4-5 times I must say that everything I have eaten has tasted just like a frozen dinner. Maybe I'm just choosing the wrong items? Each time I've gone, I have always selected one of they're daily specials -- I would assume that you don't screw up a daily special, correct?

Today I went with the chicken stir fry. Chicken was grilled at some point (grill marks) and was very dry. Veggies were drowned in sauce (seemed like they've been sitting in a tub with sauce for a while & then heated up). White rice was rice was fine. 
Lunch special came with a salad and piece of bread. Salad had shredded lettuce, a piece of cucumber, a tomato slice, and an onion string.

I'm sure I will be back as my coworkers visit this place frequently. But from a food standpoint, I give the place a SOLID 2."}
{"text":"I love this place and have since I was a kid, hope I'm not dating my self here....lol.  Any who growing up on the west side of town, I loved going to beauregrad's to eat, from the salads, to the burgers everything is just great.  I try and visit Beauregard's every time I go to visit my grandma, I went to see her this past Saturday so I decided that I needed a Beauregard's grilled chicken salad in my life.  I knew that they had the Murder Mystery thing going on, but I didn't think it was as big as it is.  So I called my food in like I always do, and went to pick it up about 10 minutes later.  I got there and it was no where to park, this is something that I'm not use to.  So I had to park further down then I was use to, I think the spaces made just for pick up were all taken up by the murder mystery people.....shame.  Any who, I got out the car and wow there was a crowd of people waiting to get in the door.  It made me feel like this was the last place to eat at on Freedom Dr.  Can any one say fire hazard?  Tried to get in the door, and the rude people waiting at the door were too snooty to be there.  But I gave them the benefit of a doubt, made my way in the door no one wanting to move, or being nice enough to do so.  So I had to push my way in, got the same excellent service as I always do.  Leaving I had to again push my way through the door, the rudest people ever.  Made me say hmm I don't think I want to go back if I'm visiting my grandma on the weekend again.  But I shouldn't let butt holes ruin my time with Beauregard's.  I just wish they could better plan this event, make it so that the people waiting to see this show come in on the other side of the building and let the other door be for those who aren't there to see the show, and those who just want take out.  Other than that, the food was great as always, I ate it so fast I don't remember what it taste like.  Made me want a do over, but I didn't want to go through that crazy crowd again."}
{"text":"I came to Beauregard's for their mystery dinner theater on Saturday evening. I was surprised they offered something like this since the set-up was less than ideal. We were suppose to mingle around and interview the suspects, but it was tough to identify suspects because 1) many people were in costume, 2) they did introduce themselves but the mic was very quiet so it was extremely difficult to hear 3) There was very little room in between people and there was a big column blocking the main stage area.  

Upon are arrival we had salads waiting for us. This was bagged iceberg shredded lettuce, a mealy tomato, and a cucumber. This was beyond uninspired but the dressing was tasty (though bottled most likely). Our group mostly ordered the prime rib and two had the blackened chicken pasta. I thought the prime rib was better than expected. It was a tad on the small/thin side but it was cooked right (I asked for rare) and it was served with a nice baked potato and some au jus. I tried the pasta which wasn't amazing, but it certainly wasn't bad. The dessert was a pineapple orange pound cake which I found to be an odd choice. I was expecting it to be a signature dessert so I thought it might be good. It wasn't. It was served with canned pineapple and was overwhelmingly sweet. Why not serve chocolate cake, cookies, mousse? Those are choices more people are likely to enjoy. 

The service was friendly -if a bit frantic. I felt bad for the servers since there wasn't a ton of room in the first place and now they had to work around people during the inquisition phase when people were walking around. I had to ask a couple times for some horseradish but in general I never wanted too long for anything. My drinks remained full..though the water had a bit of a funny pipe taste. 

The show was bad. Costumes were super cheesy and the storyline very confusing. There were a ton of characters- maybe giving each table a list might help, or even name tags. Some actors were better than others but oddly enough their audience appointed actors did the stand-out job. There was very little actual show time and most of the time consisted of us having to go around and interview actors...or audience members. Which sounds more fun than it is because you wanted to enjoy your dinner. They took some cute pictures in the beginning and tried to get us to buy them for $20- but I wish they spent the money on a better production or layout. 

We had fun since we came as a group, but overall half of us (and several others in the audience) left early, as it was rather disorganized and seemed to drag on. I would not pay full price, and I would not return."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here a couple of nights ago since it was close by and my studying was getting in the way of cooking. We didn't order much, the blacked chicken pasta (about $11) and an order of cheese fries. Apparently, you can get the blacked chicken pasta for 8.50 on Thursdays. We were disappointed to find that the cheese fries were unforgivably greasy and could not eat them. The blacked chicken pasta was also very bland.. there was absolutely no flavor in the pasta sauce..it felt like straight up cream. The salad that came with the pasta was literally burger iceberg lettuce, a slice of tomato, and a slice of cucumber....salad does not equal sandwich toppings. The garlic bread was soggy and tasteless, no crunch at all. 

We won't be ordering take out from here again. Hopefully sit down is better. I feel that Gardenia puts out better food and its not as far down Freedom."}
{"text":"Tony is an awesome server! He knows our names by heart and he is just down right pleasant. Lunchtime is very busy here so unless you have a hour lunch or getting a togo order, while working you may not have enough time. But I am lucky and get an hour lunch every other week! yay!  

We actually come here for work lunches for special occasions. They have great special everyday. This time I ordered the shrimp plate with baked potato and mixed veggies. The mixed veggies were amazing, I was glad I asked instead of getting the slaw (which normally comes with that entree). No extra charge either.

Salads are ginormous! I can never eat a whole one. The Mushroom and Swiss burger is also one of my faves, I've gotten it about 3 times already. I have also had the BLT with fries, and baked chicken. 

Guess what y'all, I'm going back tomorrow! I will do my best to check in with my bojankety cell phone service, but I am sure I will eat good and as always, enjoy the pleasant service."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is a gem. Don't let the neighborhood or the exterior scare you away now. This is one of those hidden gems that has stood the test of time. 

The food here is fabulous and the interior is quite cute. On top of all that, it's quite cheap and affordable As a matter of fact, I think I'll go ahead and mosey on in tonight!"}
