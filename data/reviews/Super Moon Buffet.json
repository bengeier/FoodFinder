{"text":"If you like food that has been sitting out for a dangerously long time without properly maintained temperatures in the midst of bleak looking gaudy decor all wrapped up in a ridiculous price then this is the place for you. If you want anything fresh you would have to wait 30 minutes to an hour just for them to replace it. It was like a creepy cafeteria.

By the way, what happened to the ice cream?

And have fun getting sick after you are finished with your delightful meal.

They even put false photos of a really nice looking buffet in their mailing advertisements, it is NOTHING like what they describe.

I just wasted $20 that I could have spent at many other great places like The Golden Buddha, and I probably would've ate more food over there since I wouldn't have gotten sick."}
{"text":"Closed.  Mixed feelings since the food tasted good, but it is always opening and closing which is scary."}
{"text":"I am very surprised.  It is huge, clean, and very well stocked.  Was everything perfect?  No!  It is a buffet!  You don't pay $7.99 to eat at the French Laundry.  

For sheer volume?  This is probably as good as it gets in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wow! Scary, scary! It's a huge space with a buffet that goes on forever. Sounds like a fat girls Nirvana, right? None of the hot dishes were hot. At best they could have been called lukewarm. Some were room temperature-the sushi IS room temperature. This is bacterial breeding ground. I'm totally serious. Some of my reviews are meant to be funny-this is NOT. I'm calling the Health Department from the car.
Well, I actually DID try to call the health department from the car. It was impossible.  I had to make an online complaint.
Sadly, if it wasn't for the temperature issue, The flavors were good.   I feel badly for the owners  I'm not sure it's possible to make a cavernous space that's laid out like that pay.  BUT, I can't let them leave out room temperature food.  I have to say something.
Maybe they should close between the lunch and dinner rush?  Or buy covers for the food?  Or TURN UP THE FOOD WARMERS!!!!!!

Something needs to be done before I go back.  Because honestly, the food tasted good.  It makes me sad."}
