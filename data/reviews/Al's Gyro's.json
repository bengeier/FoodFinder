{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place ! My boyfriend introduced it to me and I can't get enough of it honestly, it is family owned, the mother and daughters are so sweet, and are always very efficient with their customer service, 

I always order the Philly chicken ! It is delicious, my boyfriend always gets the normal gyro and says it is to die for, 

This place deserves a lot more recognition than it probably gets, it is defiantly a must visit if you are near the area :) 

Fast service, and excellent food !"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're hungry. I waited 45 minutes on one plateI was told it would take 20 minutes. The gyros and kebabs were cold by the time I receive them. We have tried this place twice and both times we had long waits."}
{"text":"I will go out of my way to eat here again ~ friendly, fast and unbelievably good gyros!!  Clean and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is our go to gyro place. We try other gyro places but we always tend to come back to this one. The sevice is great, the food is ALWAYS hot, and the french fries are really good, the best we have ever had at a gyro place. It is also family friendly."}
{"text":"I left a previous review for the same place under the previous name of the business. Went back for a second time and everything was great again. Can't beat a gyro, fries, and drink for 5 bucks. Leave full and happy every time. Please keep this special and I will be a regular here along with the guys I work with."}
{"text":"Best Gyro and Salad combo in town, so sad will be moving away from this delicious spot, great customer service and consistent quality, highly recommend"}
{"text":"We happened on this quite by accident : we were looking for a quick bite after shopping most of the day, and we saw a Subway from the road, but after parking, we spotted Al's, and decided to give it a try rather than face another Subway sandwich. 
We were greeted by the counter guy as we walked in.  Very friendly place, great food, and prices. 
I am vegetarian, and I had an excellent falafel pita, with the best falafel I have ever had.  It was a big sandwich, delicious, and I could not have eaten any more.  My wife barely ate half of her gyro, which she said was excellent, but just more than she could eat (we took it home for dinner). 
This is a very nice place for lunch!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went there today and my wife and I got the gyros. The food was great, restaurant clean. We would go back there again."}
{"text":"We've been to Greece, but Al's blow those gyros out of the water. I got the chicken gyro and salad combo, my husband got the regular lamb gyro combo. Both were incredible. The staff was very proud of their food and I don't blame them. They were so friendly and checked on us several times throughout our meal. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma I have had since moving to Arizona. The chicken is always fresh, and I've been told that the beef is great too! Salads are great on the side. Great value for your money, easily enough for 2 meals."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Delicious food at great prices and everything seemed to be fresh. The only reason I didn't give it give stars was because of the cleanliness of the restrooms. Other than that, I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Wow, excellent taste! Felt like having something healthier. So undecided to stop by and get a gyros, after looking at their full menu, I decided to go for a Greek Chicken salad. Could not have made a better choice. I had to have some carbs so I also ordered a pizza puff. Must say that the chicken is tender, moist and delicious! The sales was an excellent compliment. 
Thank you very much for that excellent experience. We will see each other soon."}
{"text":"Great place, staff is humble and kind and very patient. They have a great selection of food and the atmosphere is very chill and has a local feel too It. Love the vibe, thanks Al! Filled with perfectly flavored meat! My mom pulls gyros apart when she eats them so excuse the pic but this place is delicious. :) definitely will come back when we come back to az"}
{"text":"Food was great - the chicken was not dry which can be so hit or miss at places, pita bread was soft and chewy and veggies were fresh. Big portions for small prices and food came out quickly. The sauce that came with the chicken gyro was pink - like, definitely pink - and I'm not sure why it's that color but it tasted good with the gyro. Will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Great food and fabulous customer service. I have tried many gyros places and this is by far one of  the best in the valley."}
{"text":"My goodness do I love the gyro here!  The man who works the counter gave me a sample and I have been hooked every since.  Great with their greek salad or fries, the only thing that I would change would be to offer fresh brewed tea as the perfect compliment to amazing food!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. First of all, the service. You will feel like you just walked into the friendliest little Gyro joint right in downtown Chicago each time you come in here. They treat you like you're a part of their family from the moment you walk into the door. The food is so incredibly delicious I cannot even describe it. The salads, the gyros, the EVERYTHING. Their Tzatziki sauce is the the best I've ever had. The portions are generous and the prices are very fair. The $5.99 Gyro Combo includes the best gyro you'll ever eat, a choice of the best fries in the world or a mouth wateringly delicious Greek salad AND a drink.

What more could you want from a Chicago/Greek/Gyro place? Oh did I mention, the folks who run it are from the Chicago area. SURPRISE SURPRISE, RIGHT?"}
{"text":"I did a quick stop in here to get some food on my way to a class.  Honestly, without the glowing Yelp reviews, I don't know that I would have come here.  (It's no one's fault but strip mall restaurants just aren't appealing.  And it's a shame because that's where a lot of the good family-owned places are.)  

Service was fast and my chicken wrap was fantastic.  I think they might put crack in their tzatziki - I could eat a bowl of it.  The chicken was tender and extremely flavorful.  

I am in the area frequently and look forward to returning when I'm a little less rushed."}
{"text":"The food here is great. The meats are juicy and very flavorful.  Everything tastes fresh. Even the French fries were some of the best I've had. Make sure you try the pink colored garlic sauce. It goes great on just about everything.

As for the service; it was very friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"Fail! So I have been wanting a chicken gyro since yesterday. I was pressed for time so I just ate at home and saved' some money. Today instead of driving to Pita Kabob I went.  to Al's  because it's closer and to be honest I just didn't feel like driving. Mistake, I was looking forward to a chicken gyro with some delicious tzatziki sauce but what I got was pink garlic sauce. WTF man????  Thier gyro was overloaded with meat, I mean just falling apart so I thought I would have enough to share with my dog. Not the case today the meat was miniscule not very well seasoned at all :(. The cashier is still very nice but I think I have to say see you later! On a side note, what happened to Eddie?"}
{"text":"Took my daughter to eat her first gyros after she heard me say how good they were. Ordered two gyro plates, but received something different. Got 4 quarters of flat bread instead, fries and sauce. Wasn't looking to try something new. Wasn't pleased with food or how we were ignored and being the only two people in the place. Saturday evening, May 30th. Won't spend $22.17 there again. Will take my daughter over to a different Gyros place where she can eat a real gyros."}
{"text":"Probably the best stop for kebabs/gyros/falafel etc. in the Glendale area. Great for lunch if you work at Honeywell or are a student at Midwestern or something. I got the gyro plate but was charged a bit more than expected, not sure why and didn't make a fuss over a couple bucks, but just be aware the pricing may not be accurate. The gyro was excellent, however, and the yogurt sauce was on point. Portions are very hefty."}
{"text":"Order ubereats, and the food was okay. I did the fish and chips, and I also ordered the Chicago dog and also a Greek salad. Everything was just okay, not bad what I did like was the prices so if your price hunting down a decent restaurant this might be the choice for you. Again it wasn't bad, but just not outstanding which would make me give it a 4 5 stars, the hummus had no flavor so beware and do not order that. The pita was just okay not very delicious but it was okay."}
{"text":"Best gyros in the world customer service is great I would really recommend ALS Chicago Finest Gyros!!!!! Good food service and yummy"}
{"text":"59th and Bell is a bit of a food desert.  The area has the usual suspects, Mickey D's, Mexican phone company, Wendy's, Subway, etc.  Even with my high tolerance for the aforementioned slices of Americana fast food, I needed something unique on a Phoenix Saturday afternoon with the top of the Z down and the P looking cute with her red hair tucked up under a \"Got Wine?\" baseball cap.

Out comes the Iphone and similar in color to the big red S on my chest, I punched the Yelp icon on my home screen.  Nearby, tucked between a Subway and Island Teriyaki is Al's Gyro's.  The P was game and so was I.

Despite a very impressive menu, we both opted to go with the Gyro plate which comes with, surprise, a Gyro, a Greek salad, and a drink.  The Gyro was pure comfort food for each of us. Truly one of the best Gyros each of us have had in the Valley. The pita was terrific, the portion size is huge, and the tzatziki sauce is excellent, thick and flavorful.  The salad was tasty and authentic.  A small word of warning, the Kalamata olives are NOT pitted so don't just bite down on them, you might lose a tooth.  

The service was pleasant, food came out quickly, fun photos of old Chicago on the wall-I'll definitely return. Next time, I'm going for the Chicago dog, it might just be the ticket to up my rating to a solid five stars.  Well done, Al!"}
{"text":"Great spot to handle that gyro craving.  Decor on the inside has all the typical Chicago tourist attractions and gangster posters, and a TV playing ESPN.  Staff was very friendly and honored the MWU discount!  Got the #1 combo which was a lamb gyro with fries and a fountain drink.  Gyro was stuffed and filling.  Came with onions and tomato and tzatziki sauce.  The fries were East coast style heavily fried and crispy.  Wasn't in the mood for that hence only 4 stars.  Other than the fries, this place was great!  Would go to again!"}
{"text":"I've ate here twice with my boyfriend and the gyros are yummy... I definitely would recommend going here for good food"}
{"text":"I am a native Chicagoan.  I LOVE this place!  I haven't had a gyro like this since I moved here 5 years ago!"}
{"text":"I go here once a week for the past 15 months. The food is always fresh & tasty. I like the Philly cheese steak gyro with the cheese sauce  & Greek fries on the side. I'm from the east coast and this is very close to authentic Greek/American food. I haven't ordered anything on the menu I didn't like. Thanks Eddie for making my visits a enjoyable, relaxing, and mouth watering experience!"}
{"text":"Great family owned atmosphere, with excellent food. I have the chicken Greek salad and loved it. Stop by and definitely give it a try. U won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you want a \"mouth-watering\"gyro with awesome service...this is the Gyro place to go to in Glendale, Az! Oh my goodness, just writing this review now is making me \"jonsing\" for one right about now! Check out Al's Gyros on 59th Ave and W Bell Rd. Definitely, worth checking out if you enjoy gyros and other kinds of yummy Chicagoan eats!!!"}
{"text":"Kick A**!!!! Love Al's. Gyros are off the hook! Love the fries! also love the Greek fries! Service is stellar. Dining in or Dining out. Never once had a bad experience there. The people that work there are super nice. Not sure but, seems that they have maybe a new owner. I don't know but things were good before. They're way better after. Try a Gyro from Al's You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Just had the Gyro lunch special with fries. The service  was great And the lunch was great. I will be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"One of the best family owned, small business, restaurants in the area. The owners and family are very welcoming and the customer service is right on par with their amazing flavorful food. 

There is a wide selection of different types of food. From a gyro to chicken and hummus to a great classic \"Chicago\" Hot dog, you can't go wrong with whatever you choose. The food always seems fresh and the pita bread is soft, warm, and delightful. The price is spot on too! 

Come and enjoy this place. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great customer service and delicious food. I would definitely recommend coming in for lunch. If you're ordering for the office you can call the order ahead of time."}
{"text":"This place is SO good!! I got the grilled veggies and hummus plate and completely loved it. The spanakopita is good, my mom liked her hot dog too. AND THE FRENCH FRIES! Seriously they are amazing. Whatever you get....add a side of French fries!!  Menu is well priced. You do have to wait a little for your food, but because it's all fresh made and totally worth it. Cute family owned place with great food. I'll be coming here all the time now. In fact, I've been here two days in a row #noshame."}
{"text":"I love the Gyro, fries and drink combo.....you can't go wrong with the old number 1. Their Gyro is very good and always if a fresh pita. It is worth making a trip here for the fries alone. They are done up perfect! For sure this is a work place hang out during lunch time.

I am sure that everything else on the menu would be equally as good, but I just can't get away from combo number 1."}
{"text":"I work up the street from Al's and I have to say they never let me or my wife down. Their food is always great and they are very friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Great food and very good customer service I will eat here all the time. It's very family organized and the mean is amazing. Me and my family are going eat here more often."}
{"text":"This place is a true gem. The staff is always very pleasant & the restrooms are super clean. 
Now to the food... Delicious! Best tzatziki sauce in the area!"}
{"text":"This is a regular lunch spot from work. I personally always get their lunch special, gyro sandwich with fries. Let me also add that they aren't cheap with their gyro meat. They stuff that pita! Great flavor and definitely one of the more greasy and oily gyro meat I've tried in the valley. 

Worth the try and it's noteworthy If you have a short time for lunch, call your order in ahead, this saves me easily 5-7minutes every time."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. I work down the street, and frequent this Al's with a co-worker 2-5 times a month, depending on what we feel like eating. Al's Gyro's never disappoints. Their food is very flavorful, and the serving size is pretty big, so it fills you up and keeps you satisfied all day. If you go there long enough, the cashier remembers you (well at least me and my coworker) because every now and then she'll give us a discount or throw in a free baklava (also delicious). 
I've tried a few different things on the menu, and I have to say that the chicken pita is my absolute favorite. It's real chicken, that is marinated and  it's heavenly. Their french fries are also so so good. And for some reason, their coca cola in the soda fountain is also just so good, and tastes sweeter than at other places. The seating is limited, but even during lunch time (12-1 is my lunchtime) I have always found a spot to sit and never had to wait more than 10 minutes to get my food. They also serve you the food to wherever you are sitting. All in all, I love Al's gyros, and will keep going there!!!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time! I ordered Gyro sandwich combo! I was amazed at the portion size! It was very generous portion! Meat & fries! & the price was $7.50 for combo including drink very reasonable! I met the owner Eddie very friendly person! Looking forward visiting again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming here for years, it appears that they go under new management often but the quality of the food hasn't changed one bit! It's a bit of a drive from where we are located now but always worth it, I get the Philly chicken, the chicken is always moist and marinated well, and their French fries are to die for! The staff are always friendly and welcoming, I will always return to this place I wish I could visit more often :)"}
{"text":"So happy to find a good gyro joint close to home! I usually go to Pita Jungle when I want a  good gyro but they're a ways from me and they don't serve fries. Popped in to Al's to give them a try and they were delicious! My only reason for a four star was because their fries, although super good,  were placed in a paper bag straight out of the fryer and it just made a big greasy mess in my to go bag. I wouldn't have minded waiting a bit longer for them to work the grease off.  Other than that, this will be my gyro joint of choice!"}
{"text":"I went here earlier with my friend who works there. And I ed it!!! The Greek/Assyrian food was very authentic- I being Assyrian myself! I ordered the Italian Beef which was just bursting with flavor with the peppers I put on top of it! It made the meal have a little kick and spice! I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone who's American or Assyrian- It really doesn't matter you'll love  it either way! Bring some friends over here to eat n' chat for a little bit or even bring the whole family here to catch up on old times or modern things! It's not just Greek/Assyrian dishes there are also some American dishes like \"#11 Chicago Hot Dog\". Anyway, great place to bring family or friends together! Or maybe even a nice stranger you just met...  The people here are very nice and genuine- plus they really care about their customers! They just might even remember your name if you were to come there very very often!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I was here the place was super clean and the food was delicious it came out super fast the gentleman running the cash register was very friendly with good customer service. I ended up taking another order to my husband at work because I enjoyed my lunch I wanted him to try it too"}
{"text":"I moved here from Cali and was so hard to find a good gyros place. I stopped by here and oh man I will continue to keep coming. People that work here are very very nice. Food was amazing as well. I will definitely be back here again and bring my family as well. Must try people very tasting food. I love it"}
{"text":"Coming from the Midwest this is the closet to being home...the food is good and the prices are decent and friendly service... will return again but they close early"}
{"text":"Really good, fresh gyros and a roomy comfortable interior. Good prices and the meat was sliced perfectly. Bread was fresh baked and tasty."}
{"text":"Al's gyros is the best gyros in town. I always order the gyros plate and they have no problem with substituting grilled onions with my gyro. The tzatziki sauce is the best in town. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I got a Chicago Gyro with Chicago fries. LOVED IT! Small low key atmosphere. Sauces are house made. I highly recommend this place! I will be returning soon :)"}
{"text":"Food is awesome here and authentic!!  Always go here during lunch for their special which includes a gyro packed full of meat and a salad.  You have the choice of either salad or fries (tried both) but prefer the salad.  The meat is very fresh and the added sauce is good.

The guy at the front of the house is always welcoming his customers and appreciates the local business.  

Only con for this place is they have raised the lunch special price."}
{"text":"Love the customer service and the food is spectacular. I will never go to another gyro place. They have my loyalty."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is soooooo good! Nice mom n, pop shop with reasonable prices and you can taste the thought and love they put into their food! Fresh ingredients, large portions and friendly service! I got the Greek chicken salad and now I have a hard time ordering from other Mediterranean restaurants. Place is hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Close to home & work.Fast online ordering.Friendy counter service.
Ordered gyro platters & beef to go ..The meat was tasty and tender.Lots of rice ,good size portions although I'd like a bit more tomatoes & onions.
Only con is directional parking...You can only go one way, if all the spaces are taken, you've got to drive around the whole building or go back out into traffic.
Otherwise my local go to for gyros, will be back for more."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service...what more could you want? I ordered the gyro special, my wife ordered the chicken gyro. Both were topnotch. Al runs a great gyro shop. We showed up right near closing time and still got a great welcome and great service. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to write a review for this places and am recently new to yelp.  I have been coming here for years and it is my favorite lunch spot in then Phoenix area.  Wonderful Greek good gyro plate with the rice and Greek salad on side all wonderful.  Great flavor and good size portions.   To top off they do the Chicago thing.  Only been to Chicago once and loved the food there, and this reminds me of it.  Chicago dog is a must have item.  Best Chicago dog in town.  Double boom"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. The best Chicken gyro I've ever had came from here. The portion sizes are great and the prices are phenominal."}
{"text":"It's the real Greek deal. Lamb Beef Keota was fresh. Basmati rice was cooked to perfection. Tatziki sauce was just right & complimented the food perfectly. 

3 kinds of hummus available. Roasted red pepper, jalapeno, & plain. All very tasty with warm fresh pita bread.  

Prices were reasonable & parking convenient. Can't wait to use their catering"}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be an amazing vegetarian stop but I was extremely disappointed. I picked up a falafel wrap and a veggie/hummus plate. Was told the veggie plate would take about 10 minutes which struck me as a little odd (how long does it take to sauté some vegetables when there is no one else in the restaurant?) Well, when I got home I realized why. The vegetables had to be defrosted. There is no way what I got was fresh. Squishy broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. Dreadfully bland too - it looks like they might have dusted them with paprika but seriously lacked in flavor. The red pepper hummus wasn't particularly interesting either (though the olive oil they drizzled on top was delicious!). 

The falafel was tragic as well. A pita overfilled with tzatziki that was too thick and 4 extremely uniform falafel patties. I assume they were also prepackaged because they were super dense and all I could taste was the frying oil. 

Bottom line - nothing seemed fresh or \"home made\" which is a total bummer. My search for decent falafel west of the 17 continues!"}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING! Very tasty! Fries are seriously the best I've had! The gentleman and lady working there were very friendly. The gentleman has the best positive and upbeat attitude I've seen lately!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is definitely underrated. Everything on the menu is affordable and delicious. Every time I come here the service is also great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"One of the best Gyros I've ever had. Definitely coming back here! Even their fries rocked! The staff is super friendly which makes everything even better"}
{"text":"Expensive for the portion. Long wait even though there were barely any customers. Why did I go here Instead of the amazing Greek Wraps a few minutes away?! Worst decision of my life!"}
{"text":"The good things first....

Service: the cashier and cook were very kind and helpful with what they thought we would enjoy. 

Cleanliness of eating area: the booths and tables were kept clean. The bathroom were a different story. 

Food and presentation: the food was nothing to distinguish it from any other Mediterranean place. In fact the rice was tasteless and the lamb was dry. The pita was perfect though. The Mediterranean salad was drowned in dressing. 

Cost: WAY WAY WAY overpriced. Not worth half the price they charge but they caught us very hungry or we would have walked out."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!  Best in the area.  Had gyros the other night and went back again the next day to sample their combo Italian beef and sausage with perfectly grilled peppers and onions.  Plus the owner and his hardworking lovely wife are a true joy to meet!  We took baklava home both nights as well!  We will be back, again and again!"}
{"text":"We won't go back EVER. We had a very bad experience with the new owner. Time to find a new Gyro place! There are plenty of them, so no big deal.

It's too bad though. We've been going to this place for several years. I miss the old owner. But, like I said, there are other gyro places out there nearby."}
{"text":"Great little Greek place! Gyros are top notch high quality! They use an actual spit traditional style this is not pre-packaged frozen meat. The falafels are excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Eating here right now. Got the Gyros fries falafel humus and a chicken salad between two people. DELICIOUS!! everything came hot and authentic, considering I came from Chicago I had high expectations and those were beat. Must come !"}
{"text":"Pretty good! The gyros were average - not amazing but not bad at all. The dolmas were good (I should have asked them to omit the feta cheese, though...). The original hummus had an odd aftertaste. The pitas were amazing! I might return."}
{"text":"Great food and nice staff. They have a great lunch specials ($6.99 gyro, fries and a drink). I had that as well as some wings. Wings could've been spicer, but they were still good. I want to go back and try the pizza puff and Chicago dog. 
Very friendly staff and good food.
Give them a try"}
{"text":"What can I say, if you're looking for authentic, affordable dinning, with friendly staff,  Al's is the place. I have not had a Gyro as good as Al's since the 80's, seriously! I don't know what happened to the other customers who left bad reviews, but my family and I have nothing but an awesome dinning experience every time we visit."}
{"text":"I came here and tried to order Al's gyro, specifically. You know, the one that the name of the restaurant is advertising? I'm pretty sure that his gyro would probably taste the best, but I'm guessing he finished eating it a while back

I settled for a beef plate, with fries on the side. From the first bite I knew this was a match made in heaven. Which is weird because I don't recall ever being there, or being married to Greek food

Their fries were absolutely magical. Of course, we know they can't ACTUALLY be magical, as that's one of the exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration. Still, I wouldn't be surprised if they had house elves in the back of their kitchen, secretly prepping the food and making it delicious. Come to think of it, maybe it was Hermione who altered my memory with a memory charm, which is why I can't remember the match made in heaven (sorry, I'm not dropping this). After all, she IS the one who's best at charms. Fucking mudbloods

Since my first visit I've had falafel and chicken, and I can confirm that these two are indeed different meats than beef. In fact, falafel is made primarily from chick peas. Falafel is a funny-ass word, but it tastes pretty fab, so who am I to judge

---------------------

I stop by Al's on my way to class for lunch sometimes, and it never fails to satisfy. Great family-owned restaurant with excellent food and friendly service! Would recommend to anyone.

{"text":"I hope this is an American success story!  Good neighborhoodd marketing got me in the door. The service, quality, portion size, and great Mediterranean food will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"My first time here and had a great experience. The ambiance is casual and reminded me of the similar restaurants back in Chicago. The place was brightly lit with pictures of Chicago landmarks lining the walls. 

I ordered a gyro sandwich meal. The fries were nice and crispy, tasted good. The sandwich was huge, stacked with gyros, tomatoes and onions. The sauce was also really good; it was different from what I'm used to - it was more creamy than chunky. 

All in all, had a great experience! 

My only suggestion is to update the menus; the prices on Yelp don't match the prices in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I am not one to try new things. However  with all the amazing  reviews I figured why not. If it I didn't see these reviews I would have never tried it. The #1 Gryo is so tasty and the fries there omg they are melt in your mouth. I can say there fries are the best I have ever had. Definitely my new favorite food place. Dangerous that I live so close to it."}
{"text":"There's a closer gyro place to my house, but I drive further to go to this one. Their food is absolutely phenomenal...and they give you a full combo (gyro, salad, drink) for under $7.  I don't really get on yelp pftem, but I can't believe these other nearby gyro places get away with selling food that tastes half as good as this place for like 4 bucks more. Had to give Al some justice!!"}
