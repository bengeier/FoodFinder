{"text":"I haven't handed out five stars in awhile, and I am very excited to do so for this hidden gem in First Markham Place. First there are the handmade noodles, that have the perfect bite and texture to them. The broth is kept simple on purpose to let the quality of the noodle shine. My family and I were also lucky enough to get this dim sum dish that looks like yellow yuen bos (chinese gold pieces) that are actually only available upon reservation due to the labor it takes to mass produce the dish. The chef was nice enough to let us sample it when we asked what it was, and he had some extras from the reservation for tonight. They are filled with a condensed milk like filling and is petite and unique. Neat dessert piece. We also got the Xiao Long Bao, which in my personal (and my family's) opinion is waaayyy better than Ding Tai Fong. When I bit into it, the soup was flavourful, but not overly salty like many other restaurants. The chef then told us that it's because they don't add msg to the Xiao Long Baos, but instead  rely on the natural flavours of the ingredients. Then we had this wrap thing with a dough stick inside (also has hoisin sauce and chinese onion in it) which was delightful. The wrap was made from scratch (as is everything else thus far), and both textures and flavours was excellent. Finally there was a dish with marinated chinese pulled pork I guess you could say, b/w two white pan toasted homemade breads. Again flavourful and awesome texture. The price for this place is also quite low, most dishes are well under $10, and average about 6-7 bucks a dish I would say.   Sure this restaurant isn't anything fancy, but I believe that the cultural aspect of the dishes (which you can surely taste), as well as the determination of the chef to make most things from scratch is highly commendable and is quite rare these days in the Chinese food industry. As a result I believe that this place is well deserving of the 5 stars I've given them, and I hope more people can discover this place and share their thoughts on it as well! If you're curious about the dishes I've talked about, I've uploaded the pictures so take a gander =)"}

{"text":"3.5 star   Ling Long Legend is a Northern Chinese Restaurant opened up in First Markham Place, replacing V2 Noodle.   This new restaurant also specialized in noodles, but fresh hand pulled ones. You have a choice of narrow, regular and wide, depends on your preferences. You can see the lady actually making the noodle in the front counter.   Aside from noodles, there are also Shanghai dim sum and other Northern style dishes.   The reason I like Ling Long Legend because they are really single friendly in a way there are quite a few of smaller tables. Even the Steamed bun has a smaller portion, 4 in each order.   The Beef Noodle Soup ($7.99) with a really light broth and the beef was tender. The regular noodle was cooked al dente, a little on the chewy side.   Small Steamed Bun ($3.99) was also really good, as good as DTF next door. The skin though a tad thicker, but it is semi transparent and I can see the soup inside the bun inside. Best to eat is to wait for them to cool down a little and just eat the whole bun as a whole and let the soup and flavour expose in your mouth........   Waitresses are in training so a lot of hesitation but both really nice and friendly.   I definitely suggest to give Ling Long Legend a try if you are into noodles and Shanghai dim sum!"}
