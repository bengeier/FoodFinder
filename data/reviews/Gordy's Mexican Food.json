{"text":"Had been excited to try this new hole in the wall, strip mall Mexican restaurant. Well excitment quickly turned to disappointment. Food lacked in taste and quality. Service lacked. The place appeared clean. Unfortunately 1 out of 3 won't cut it. The menu was small. I did like the chips...so that's something :?/"}
{"text":"I came here with my best friend and we split a bean and cheese burrito and we got a few street tacos. The street tacos were amazing!  We did have to wait a little bit because it was taco Tuesday and some big group wiped them out, but the girl behind the counter kept checking on us and she was so nice! The burrito was fresh and the tortilla was amazing. The tacos were so flavorful and fresh. The salsa was on point. I will definitely be back. Great local restaurant with a friendly small town feel."}

{"text":"Great mexican restaurant! The meat had a lot of flavor and I liked the salsa. They were made fresh to order and it was very authentic. The people there were extremely friendly as well. My husband is a bit of a Mexican food snob (he only likes \"real\" mexican food), he was ready to go back the next day."}
