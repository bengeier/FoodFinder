{"text":"Sweet little place. Delicious food and desserts. Friendly staff. Would recommend to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food and friendly service. Try the zucchini pancakes- they are super good."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a crepe.  I went around the corner from Pamelas, and the salmon savory crepe was very good. The atmosphere is nice.  The wait staff is helpful and cheerful.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"My friends and I had several savory crepes as well as a liege.  The crepes were perfectly cooked and the fillings fresh and tasty.  The waitress was very helpful and we received prompt service."}
{"text":"We have been seated and haven't met our server get. It's been ten minutes. The food all looks and smells good but apparently we aren't good enough to eat it. Pretty upset but that's okay. We gave it a try."}
{"text":"Very good crepes. Is open much later than most brunch places. Loved their banelle crepe! Wish they had some form of fries-home or French fries. Good coffee as well"}
{"text":"I was really happy with his place. Another small hole in the wall with a very friendly wait staff and cozy atmosphere.  I got the Alaskan crepe which had spinach, smoked salmon, and an herb cream cheese. The salmon tasted very good and the cream cheese appeared whipped as it was smooth and airy. The crepe also came with a small salad on the side. The greens were a spring mix with slices of apple and a light vu egrets on it. It went really well with the dish I also split a dessert crepe that was covered in nuts, filled with Brie, and had maple syrup in it. I thought it was equally as good as the Alaskan crepe. The menu is loaded with sweet and savory crepes. If you don't find something you like, you can make your own. I really enjoyed running into a spot that is clearly not your everyday spot. Pittsburgh isn't really a hot bed for crepes. If you want something different, I'd suggest it as definitely being worth a shot."}
{"text":"Had Cafe Moulin on my bucket list for a while and finally got the chance to check it out. There was a wait to be seated and the cafe does not take reservations, so make sure you have time if you decide to go. However, you can put your name on the list and take a stroll around Walnut street while waiting.  I ordered their sweet crepe \"Walnut Street\" with has a Brie filling and is topped with walnuts, granola, powdered sugar, and maple syrup and comes with the whipped cream on the side. I also ordered a side of egg whites.   While the meal itself was a bit smaller than I would have liked, the crepe was absolutely delicious. The inside was nice and creamy with paired really well with the toppings. The additional egg whites on the side made the meal filling.  Even though this place is a little bit on the pricy side, you can tell the food is made with quality ingredients. Highly recommend Cafe Moulin!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for brunch. The Nutella hot chocolate is amazing. The French toast: top notch. Very charming little place and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Cafe Moulin has become a regular spot for my husband and I, especially for breakfast but we've also taken out-of-town visitors for lunch. The food has been consistently scrumptious, the wait staff is super friendly and attentive (and is part of the reason we come back), and they make good espresso drinks which is key for us. We usually bring our 10-month old son, and the staff is accommodating and sweet to him. It is kid-friendly without being a \"kid place,\" if you know what I mean. Also, we've started going regularly on Sunday mornings. It's a busy time (good for them!) and sometimes there is a wait. We've never actually had to wait, but seen people waiting. Probably not for too long, and it's worth it. I have to say the staff does a good job staying on the ball, keeping coffees warm and demeanors friendly even when very busy. It's just a great place."}
{"text":"We went to Cafe Moulin last week for Brunch. The servers were polite, but they are VERY VERY understaffed. They probably need about double the help they currently have to serve tables. The table turn over time is very slow because they are understaffed, making the wait times pretty long. Also, once you have a table, it takes them a while to take your order, and they don't have time to check up on you to see if you need anything. At one point, we were without utensils for quite a while and couldn't eat our food. The food at Cafe Moulin is not bad. We had savory and sweet crepes. I was impressed by the sweet crepe, but not so much by the savory crepe. I have lived in Nancy, France, where I ate really delicious crepes. Also, the crepes in Philadelphia (where I lived for 4 years) were amazing (particularly at Pari Cafe Creperie). I would say the crepes at Cafe Moulin are not bad, but also not breath-taking. Due to the understaffing of the restaurant, I would probably not come back again for brunch on the weekend."}
{"text":"Crepes are my favorite breakfast choice, and I have to say, Cafe Moulin has the best crepes I've ever had!! Cafe moulin offers so many different choices of crepes that you will definitely find one that you love. The \"Super Belgium\" is my favorite, which is made with cookie spread in the middle. It's phenomenal!! The restaurant is small and cozy and service is fast! If you have the chance to get brunch in Pittsburgh, make sure you stop here!"}
{"text":"I ended up at Cafe Moulin because the wait at Pamela's was too long, and I thought it might be fun to try to something new. I ordered a sweet crepe that ended up being delicious and beautifully plated. However, I waited close to an hour to eat. I am not sure if I will be back if the service doesn't improve."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food and service was top notch. Just be prepared to wait as the seating is limited. You need to try this place, I've never had better crepes in my life!"}
{"text":"Having been at Paris experiencing true French crepes, Cafe Moulin provided me with a similar experience to the authentic ones I had there! Cafe Moulin gives you choices between Sweet and Savory crepes. Having had both, I continue to go back to the Savory crepes because of the delicious salad that goes with it!  Only complaint has to be the service: the waitress we had was not very friendly, and treated us as if we were a burden on her."}
{"text":"Cafe Moulin is a nice french style cafe that falls a bit short on delivering a french experience.  I had high hopes for this place but as someone who grew up in Europe and ate crepes every week since I could remember I also had high exceptions  First of all if u want to make crepes take an egg, a cup of flour, a cup of milk and some salt ... mix it.  Take that mixture and pour a small amount in a frying pan and swish it around to cover the bottom... you are welcome I just saved you $10   I remember coming to a crepe place in a basement for french class in 10th grade, and just being astounded at how good it was.  I want to say it was Cafe Moulin, or its predecessor... im not sure, either way my experience went from amazing to meh.   I came here primarily because a friend had never had \"french\" crepes. And unfortunately she left without having any.  Long story short... 4 crepes and $40 later we had what amounted to a meh experience.  Some of the savory crepes were decent but more of a snack than a meal.  As for the dessert crepes soooooo disappointing with the selection.  Half of the crepes or more had nutella on them So if u put nutella on a crepe u reallyh only have a few options nuts, crumbs or bananas.  the taste is so strong and overpowering that it makes the fruit sour or just eliminates it.  All of the crepes we had though well cooked were just not complex and lacked unique ingredients.  Service was slow took a while to get the crepes though it didnt seem terribly busy.  Though the crepes were nothing great or unique i would come back for the other things on the menu"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and creative design. Most choices of savory crepes are both tasty and healthy (small salad+dressing is a nice complement). This is my favorite place in Shadyside, both to have a nice meal with friends and get a snack+coffee on my own and study for a bit. Brunch time on Saturdays is crowded, but during other times it seems to be much less busy."}
{"text":"As a Frenchman, I want to say that what this place offers is not even remotely close to savory French crepes. The so called \"classic\" section of the menu does not propose the basic ham-cheese-egg crepe. A quick chat with the owner revealed that he didn't even know that crepes are traditionally served with cider (note that I don't blame him for not serving alcohol). They use regular flour instead of buckwheat flour. The avocados in the Bristol crepe weren't ripe. The Alaskan crepe was OK. Positive notes: nice interior design and polite staff."}
{"text":"The neighborhood is great, restaurant is chill and adorable, and the food is delicious. Perfect for Saturday morning brunch date. Only downside is I asked for scrambles eggs instead of omelette style and they said no... This should not be a big deal . Overall an excellent meal- I had French toast and hubby had crepes."}
{"text":"Was on my way to Pamela's and decided to pop in here instead. It was a great decision. I had the Turkish Coffee and the Black Rose Waffle. I like strong, black coffee and the Turkish coffee did not disappoint. It was actually slightly sweet. With Turkish coffee and espresso sometimes sugar is a necessity, but not here.  Now for the waffle. Another reviewer said his waffle tasted stale or dry. Yes the waffle was dense, with a crispy exterior. Could it possibly be a little lighter? Sure, but I wasn't at all put off by it. And besides with the fresh berries, the airy whipped cream and the amazing Belgian chocolate, the density of the waffle is a welcome contrast of texture.  I'll be back with my family."}
{"text":"Let me be as constructive as possible.   First the good: I think that they did a great job with their renovations. When Crepes Parisiennes had the spot it was sort of... dingy. The restaurant looks great, with nice stonework and a kind of owl theme going on.  Another nice feature of this restaurant is that it is excellent at not being Pamela's. I've never really gotten the fuss over Pamela's and the lines seem to rival those at the Apple store. I was seated promptly.  Other things done right: service was prompt and friendly, and the coffee was good.  Now to the heart of the review: the food. Between myself and my dining companion we tried three dishes, the \"Black and Rose\" waffle, \"the Ottawa\", and the spinach, feta and goat cheese crepe. The spinach crepe was acceptable, but the waffle was bad, and the Ottawa was an affront to my Canadian heritage.  The waffle was topped with chocolate, blackberries, and raspberries. The waffle itself was either stale or had a really dry dough--in my opinion vastly inferior to the waffles at either Waffallonia or either of the Brug(g)e(s).  The Ottawa was a leathery crepe wrapped around unseasoned eggs. It was accompanied by a fruit salad that looked suspiciously canned, and cold bacon that I would have been disappointed to see emerge from my microwave on a paper towel. I left most of my meal which is, frankly, surprising because I am a long time member in the illustrious \"Clean Plate Club\".  In summary, the food was bad enough that I will not return unless major changes are made."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the perfect place for a family who likes Crêpes or French toast. My personal favorites are the Halle berry crêpe and  the Belgium cookie. They both had a nice harder-cream texture. The atmosphere makes you feel more like you are in a underground cottage."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a new crepes/waffle place opening up...to replace a crepes and waffle place!  However, after trying both crepes and waffles I remain disappointed.  The waffle I ordered was mysteriously...not hot at all.  It was topped with grainy chocolate spread.  The crepe, while hot, was a little bland and soggy.    The ambience is nice and the La Prima coffee hit the spot, but I'd love to see improvements in the food before giving this windmill another whirl."}
{"text":"This place has the perfect crepes for a snowy day! A few friends and I walked here in a storm once. The coffee selection was great and we had a wide variety of sweet and savory crepes to choose from. Because it's a place that's really small it does get crowded at peak times and even though there was a blizzard out, we did have to wait to be seated. I would go back though for the excellent service, perhaps during a non peak hour."}
{"text":"After eating here, I'm now a true believer that crepes are meant to only be sweet. The weird combination of meat in a thin like pancake isn't so appealing after it becomes soggy by the second. Nonetheless great brunch! Excellent, friendly service and staff. I'll definitely go back satisfy my sweet tooth with their awesome Belgium crepe topped with chocolate, strawberries and bananas and the amazing lattes."}
{"text":"Had a really great early dinner here. The crepes Marseille and the French toast with strawberries were both fantastic. The staff was also very friendly. They even had some good tunes playing!"}
{"text":"I really liked the classic French toast! All was good and peaceful until a loud crowd came . But overall, really good place."}
{"text":"My star rating is kind. I don't know - are these guys French? I think not, or, if they are, they were never Crepe chefs. As a long-time customer of Crepes Parisiennes, I fully admit bias, but being tired of the shut-out at C.P. over holidays, I decided to try Cafe Moulin. Heck, I was thrilled to see that the \"crepe genre\" had been maintained despite the loss of C.P. in that spot.  I really like the do-over and being able to sit down and be served, but sadly, the Salmon crepe was fishy. The Cafe Au Lait was just coffee and milk. Of course I guess C.P.'s espresso based Cafe Au Lait is Pittsburgh's best anyway. I found it patronizing to have the meal explained to me. I wondered: if the owners _are_ perhaps French, I guess they think that Pittsburgh is the same as Bug Tussle  Alabama -- \"we done never had crepes befo'\" Whatever.  Having had crepes in Paris, I think Crepes Parisiennes is much closer to the mark. I'm sorry for that, because I am a customer and not a loyalist. I would like Pittsburgh to have another great crepery and I don't care who runs it."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place for either brunch or afternoon tea. I have been here for at lease ten times and their crepes are really fine made and delicious. I hope they could serve in a bigger portion so we don't have to order an extra plate every time we go."}
{"text":"This place is amaze!! Feels like you're in France I love it . Great atmosphere and great food! Can't wait to come back:)))"}
{"text":"First I have to say that the place looks amazing!!   I have been there a couple of times already and like how they really took the time in every detail for decoration, even the center pieces. For me that tells a lot about a place. I really feel comfortable in that place. Let's  talk about the food. I tried their crepes and waffles. All of them prepared right in front of you, simply delicious. Fruits are fresh and the plate itself looks beautifully decorated.  One thing I love is that their tea are hand filled tea bags, Good Tea!! I strongly recommend this place!!! Not even mentioned the customer service. Everybody is really friendly and welcoming!!!! I love the food and the place!! thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Never go here. Lifted my napkin to put it on my lap and a cockroach was underneath. Can't imagine what the kitchen is like"}
{"text":"Wide variety of crepes on offer. Distinct coffees too. I tried the Turkish coffee and it was quite close to what one would get in Istanbul. Really interesting French decor too.   Quite cramped, so expect to factor in a wait time for your table."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Café Moulin and I absolutely loved it. The atmosphere was very cozy and the staff was very friendly. I got a PB & J crepe and it was both delicious and filling."}
{"text":"I like this place. Its a small cafe located by Walnut St. You get a french feel and I loved the crapes. I had their Walnut and cheese crape. It was franch, big crape with nice touch of syrup..."}
{"text":"Food was good, service left something to be desired. I'm okay with the long wait, but once in service should be good. Was there for brunch and once seated (had to sit by door and had to share a menu with my brother). Food came and the waitress never came back the entire time (drinks never showed up until after we were done and she handed my bill (after I pointed it out). No apologies or anything. I gave a great tip hoping that the server would learn from her mistakes and not be so bitter. Might try again sometime, but plenty of other great places to go!"}
{"text":"This is be second time that I've ate here, and both times I was really pleased. I've gotten the Alaskan Crepe with smoked salmon and creme cheese and while I've never had a crepe (or at least a real crepe that didn't come from be frozen food section), if this is an indication of how a crepe should be, then I'm a fan. The savory crepes like mine come with a small, spring mix salad with a light oil dressing. The meal was light but left me satisfied while out and about.       I took my mom out for a late lunch and she had an egg crepe. She added bacon and a side of avocado. She only ate half, so I of course willingly finished it. The egg was done perfectly. I believe there was Brie in there which added a nice creaminess, and the bacon added that hint of salt that really made it for me.      Lastly we split a dessert crepe, it had maple syrup, walnuts, creamy cheese inside, and a side of whip cream. The waitress suggested strawberries and it was a good call. They were fresh and added a nice, clean taste to the dish. I definitely hope to stop back soon. The only real negative is that the place is a bit small. It's not a place I'd hit if you're in a decently sized group."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Monday--def no substitute for crepe Parisienne.  Crepes are fine (pricier than LCP). Latte was very weak. Decor is... Kinda off.  Other two people I were with said average, I'd say a bit below."}
{"text":"We ate here on Sunday afternoon on a short stay in Pittsburgh and I would definitely recommend it! It's a below ground place right in a cute shopping area with a cozy, warm feel. It looks like it could fill up quickly but we walked right in and were able to sit at the bar to eat. I had the Tivoli crepe with an egg and my boyfriend had the salmon crepe which were absolutely delicious; we were both members of the clean plate club within ten minutes, tops! Full selection of sweet and more meal-like crepes, check it out!"}
{"text":"Didn't read anyone else's reviews but I found this little gem by accident. I almost don't want to write about it because it is a lesser known secret hidden below street level. I would like you to know that if you want a unique breakfast experience in a quaint little restaurant with amazing crepes, then you need to try this place! Keep it a secret though so that I can get a table without waiting in a long line next time I go here. My first time eating here was today and we were seated quickly as there was no line and only two of us. The place is small and the tables close, but I didn't mind (usually do) as the decor and ambiance was distracting in a good way. Our waiter was attentive and friendly allowing us to order quickly and get our lattes without to long a wait. Our Crepes followed shortly after and the ingredients/ preparations were spot on. Make sure to get the fall special for dessert. Not the cheapest option to eat at but definitely one of the better choices for a great breakfast experience in town. P.S. Don't tell anyone! I struggled with writing this review as it may turn out to be a double edged sword, but they deserve the recognition. Job well done Moulin!!"}
{"text":"Crepes are one of the simplest foods to prepare. They are so simple to prepare that in many cities, particularly Paris, they are considered street food. A Jamon et fromage (ham and swiss) crepe in Paris costs 3.5 euros ($7) and takes between 2 and 3 minutes to prepare by a single person on a street corner.   This is why Cafe Moulin, whose crepes are adequate at best, is so frustrating:  they take 16 minutes to fill an order that should take less than 5.   And that's after it takes one of the 7 employees 20 minutes to clean a table for you.   I've been there three times and the same thing happened each time. This place is incompetent.   Cafe Moulin : the crepes are fine, nothing special. Only go if you like waiting for no reason."}
{"text":"Insanely sweet crepes but good coffee and friendly service. Not a place for sitting down and reading though unless you sit outside when the weather allows"}
{"text":"The food is good. My friend and I enjoyed our crepes. We ordered Alaskan and Ottawa, both look fantastic and taste great!  However, it took rather long (~30min) to get our food, and I have to ask for fork and knife. Kind of have the impression that our server was busy chatting with the staff most of the time. The other server realized our table was ignored (we sat right near the counter), and he promptly responded to some of our request. Would give 4-5 star if the service was better."}
{"text":"Solid brunch location. The portions are a bit small, but filling enough. The Classic Belgian crepe was our favorite dish!"}
{"text":"We tried to come here once before but it was prime time and we didn't feel like waiting. We came early on another Saturday right when they opened and had a great breakfast. I had the Bristol crepes and appreciated that they came with a bit of greens and fruit. Mack had the Turkish coffee which isn't something you see everywhere and enjoyed it as well. His crepes were satisfactory, too. Our server was incredibly personable and kind and it made our good experience awesome. I don't recall his name but he was great. The ambiance here is also nice, between the decor and music I was pretty much sold! We'll be back! It's nice to have an alternative to Pamela's in Shadyside."}
{"text":"Totally hit the spot! I love crapes! I drove an hour and a half to be here! It was perfect! Thank you so much you made my day! I got the one with turkey or chicken and avocado it was absolutely divine! My daughter had the banana new tele-and we added strawberries! Love it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always a long wait for weekend brunch, but well worth it. My friend and I's go-to brunch spot in the Shadyside area on our weekends off from work. I have gotten the Marseille crepe a few times, and my friend usually gets a sweet one, like the Halle Berry :D - you can't go wrong with either. Highly recommend getting both the pesto (I'm pretty sure is homemade) and the harissa sauce for your savory crepe! It is so delicious. Usually not a big fan of going to the same place more than once, especially since I'm only in Pittsburgh for the year, but I have no hesitation making brunch plans here even having been here about 4 or 5 times already. Quick and friendly service. Limited seating and it can get loud inside, but it's a great place to catch up with 1 or 2 friends in a relaxed atmosphere. Try this place at least once! You'll be back, I promise :)"}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter last Saturday. There was a slight wait, but not more than 10 minutes. The food was very good and the service courteous, although slow. We will come back.  We had the Alaskan crepe and the Ottawa crepe and both were delicious."}
{"text":"This was a fabulous find, thank you Yelp! My wife and I came here for brunch one Sunday morning and we are so glad we did. A top 10 breakfast spot for sure, it will definitely be a staple for us whenever we are in Pittsburgh. The unique offerings, are extremely friendly and attentive service, and proximity to other cool places makes this the perfect stop. We ordered the Walnut Street French Toast and The Sofia savory crepe. Both were unique and both were fabulous. This was the perfect experience, and we cannot wait to be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite cafes in Pittsburgh it's food is delicious the only thing that's bad about it is that it's always crowded and a small cramped space"}
{"text":"Had the Bristol crepe with goat cheese substituted for Brie, paired with a vanilla latte. Seriously some of the best food you can buy in this city... All for less than $15! Truly a gem with great service and great food. Highly recommend this place for anyone visiting or local."}
{"text":"One of my favorite french brunch places in pittsburgh!!!  I've tried several of their crepes and french toasts, and they've never failed me once! When I think of crepes, I think of a sweet dessert so I've only had one savory crepe here - the Alaskan - but even that one daring switch to savory wasn't a bad try at all. I love their french toasts the most, though. They're as fluffy as can get and never too sweet. I've tried their regular french toast with added strawberries on top, and during my most recent visit I ordered the Amsterdam French Toast. It came with turkish sausages, two eggs and a side of maple syrup. It was the perfect mix of sweet and savory.   There's a rustic yet modern vibe to this little cafe. All the workers and servers are extremely friendly and always give the best service. They all seem like family, which makes me smile when I see their happy interactions in the business."}
{"text":"That's the house panini, it is a great place for friends enjoying great foods, and great services!"}
{"text":"I've actually wanted to go to brunch here for a long time, and I don't have any excuses as to why I didn't earlier- seeing as I live right down the street.  I actually didn't like the venue very much, as it seemed to be more favorable for a coffee shop rather than a restaurant.  Located in the bowels of a Walnut side street, it was small and quaint- which unfortunately doesn't bode well for the brunch crowd.  It was way too crowded, and I ended up sitting right by the door that people kept opening and shutting and it was unbearably cold.  The food was average to above average for brunch, and the service was so-so.  I was a bit disappointed with my experience but would consider stopping in again."}
{"text":"This is an amazing breakfast/ brunch spot in shadyside. my friend recommended this place, its hidden gem, off to walnut st. me and my buddy came today for lunch, I ordered walnut st French Toast, its melted brie cheese topped wt maple butter and salted caramel that is so delicious, omggg best thing i ever had for so long ( iv attached a photo of it ) check it out. They have brunch at weekends, I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"It was my first time here for breakfast!! I had the savory Bristol Crepe!  Yummy!! The crepe was filled with roasted turkey, fresh avocado, and goat cheese with a special sauce.  The combination was mind blowing!! The crepe was done well.  When I bit into it, the first taste are the turkey and avocado, as you continue chewing the goat cheese slowly enters.  It got better and better and better with every bite.  I recommend  Cafe Moulin if you are looking for something new and different for breakfast or lunch!!!"}
{"text":"The meal was very inoffensive, if not memorable. Service was attentive. My savory crepe with eggs, cheese and bacon was slightly under-seasoned but still tasty enough. The star of the show was a friend's french toast with berries and goat cheese--delicious."}
{"text":"This is amazing place... because i enjoy crepes... My favorite halle berry and walnut street... yummy... caffe moulin is owner and servers very kind and friendly. My favorite servers nursulu and reyhan... they are smile happy and friendly I recommend everyone. Cafe moulin = delicious breakfast and lunch"}
{"text":"I didn't know I liked french toast until I tried Cafe Moulin's!  For breakfast I'm usually a sweet over savory kinda gal, so I opted for the WALNUT ST. FRENCH TOAST. It was not too sweet at all.. so yummy.. I did add strawberries on top too!  There doesn't seem to be much seating, so I could see wait time being a problem because it seems to be a great breakfast/brunch spot. Good thing I came on a Tuesday morning so there wasn't a problem, but a decent amount of people came in during the time I was eating.  This was my first visit and I will definitely be coming back to try their waffles or crepes."}
{"text":"Cozy little place, conveniently located in the heart of Shadyside. Very popular spot, but I've never had to wait longer than 20-30 min. Great food. Crepes are amazing and always fresh coffee. Friendly servers.    I always send all my friends there."}
{"text":"This is far and away my favorite place for breakfast/lunch in the city. I haven't met a crepe I didn't like. The atmosphere is cozy, which also means it can fill up fast. For two people, I've never had a wait longer than 15-20 minutes. They have an awesome coffee and tea selection as well. Def a must visit for anyone!"}
{"text":"I visited Cafe Moulin on a busy Sunday morning. It was very busy and we had a pretty long wait. The good news is you can bop around Walnut Street while you wait because they text you when your table is ready! It's small inside and a little crowded - but I was soon to find out it was all worth it! The crepes were incredible, as were the lattes. There's a large selection of savory or sweet crepes. I always choose sweet and I was not disappointed. I will be back here again. Just make sure you have a lot of time!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Cafe Moulin regularly for almost two years, and I have never once left disappointed. There is literally no bad choice on the menu. Speed of service depends on how busy it gets - on weekends, Cafe Moulin tends to get crowded (I tend to go Friday mornings, when it is much less crowded and service is much quicker) but the quality of the service has never faltered even when I've been there during a busy period. Seasonal specials come and go, but are always excellent.   I visited Paris recently, and I must say that the food here is as close as it gets to how well my wife and I ate in Paris."}
{"text":"This is a small place. There's always a wait, and it can be a little confusing about how long you'll have to wait. It's a small place so you may have to wait longer for a table because of the size of your party. We were finally seated, and our orders were fast though.   I forget how much I love crepes until I eat them. I don't have them very often, but now that I had them here recently, I really want to go back. I had turkey, avocado, goat cheese and bechemel sauce and it was so good. The goat cheese was a little overpowering in some bites, but worked well overall. My friend and I split a dessert crepe and it was definitely too much food, but totally worth it. The crepes are perfect and the fillings just work together.   The coffee was good. I had a latte and it wasn't the best, but if I was eating crepes, I'd get a latte there again. The crepes are amazing though. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This location has the best selection of both sweet and savory crepes in the Shadyside area. Seating is limited, so be sure to arrive early!  My personal favorite crepe is the Alaskan (salmon). Tip: add avocado!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Took the family for a fantastic Sunday brunch. The Alaskan, the Ottawa and the banella crepes were to die for. Highly recommend you get here. Trust me, I'm a doctor."}
{"text":"This place is very popular and crowded. I went on a Sunday. The line was about 20 min wait. The crepes are not big but fulfilling. My friend ordered the Alaskan, and I ordered the one with Turkish sausages. Mine was great! You should def try it."}
{"text":"I feel like crepes are something you always see in movies but can very rarely order out expecting a good quality one. And it's definitely not a breakfast you attempt to make at home unless you're prepared to spend all morning in the kitchen perfecting your technique.   Anyway, really wanted to try a cool latte or hot chocolate after seeing pics of their foam designs but needed some normal coffee. It was good. For the crepes, I went sweet with the raspberry white chocolate and mascarpone and my friend went savory. Here had chopped up chicken and Swiss and some sort of hot sauce. We were both happy with our picks. I almost got the Halle Berry crepes, and a lot of people around me ordered them. I bet they're also good. Cute little rustic place half-underground, would definitely return!"}
{"text":"We got there for breakfast fairly early today and found a wait that was a little long, but after hearing good things we decided to wait.   I got the PB&J crepe but our waiter advised me to try the Carl special(he was Carl), by adding banana and mascarpone to the PB&J. It was amazing. My only regret was that it left me wanting more when it finished.  The service was also great, from the time we walked in the door with the greeting up until we left.  Definitely worth the wait and a place I will be visiting again on a future trip."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Cafe Moulin on a Sunday during the Shadyside arts festival. The three of us arrived around 1:30 and the restaurant was completely full. We only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were seated at a bar area near the door. At first I was disappointed not to have a table, but it worked out fine. The restaurant is below street level and has a very cozy feel to it. I had the Alaskan crepe and a cappuccino. Both were absolutely delicious. My niece ordered an iced coffee and unfortunately, it was luke warm and the ice melted before she was 1/4 of the way through. Other than the coffee problem, all three of us devoured our food and loved every bite of it. If I lived in the area it would be dangerous because I would want to eat there every weekend morning."}
{"text":"Best crepes I have ever had in Pittsburgh (comparing to delucas & Pamela's) but my god they were bomb. And the homemade hot sauce goes amazing with the eggs, I think even Gordon Ramsey would be impressed his first time eating here"}
{"text":"We just came back from Paris and these Crepes matched anything we has there.  There was an old crepe place here my wife did not like but these folks are friendly and have a great sense of style and warmth.    We only wish it was open for dinner.   But please try this new place.  We had the Tahiti the Belgium and the French toast and each one was a winner"}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here after seeing prior reviews.  When we got there, we loved the charm of the place.  However, the hostess needs some more training on customer service.  She wasn't rude but she wasn't very welcoming either.  We had a long wait, which we don't mind if it's worth it.  The food was yummy but the portions were not worth the price.  The cheesecake crepe was pretty thin (not much filling) and, although yummy, doesn't come with any sides.  If you're there for brunch and are hungry, you may be better off with one of the savory crepes as they seemed to be more full and, therefore, looked more filling.  The regular coffee was great so I didn't bother ordering an espresso (which I would normally jump at).  The wait staff was funny, welcoming and attentive but I think they needed another person to attend to the crowd.  Overall, I might go again if I wanted something light but not if I'm really hungry."}
{"text":"The Alaska crepe was delicious. The eggs and avocado were a great addition to their pesto in the crepe with the smoked salmon."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place in Shadyside especially when im craving delicious coffee and crepes. Cafe Moulin is such an appropriate name for this quaint little cafe which will transport you to Paris when you step inside. Tucked away in a corner, this was my go-to brunch place for every other Sunday this past winter.  My favorite go-to entree is the Super Belgium with a side of turkish sausage. The crepe is filled with cookie butter and topped with bananas, strawberries and chocolate sauce. The sausage provides the much needed savoriness which lacks in the sweet crepe. Sooo yum!  My friend once got the salmon crepe and i tasted it and it was also delicious especially if you are looking for a light and savory option. My friends also love their paninis especially the ones with the harissa aioli.   P.s: Dont forget to try one of their coffee drinks but seriously their black coffee is the best. I always get so sad days when i miss their daily brewed coffee (they usually stop brewing an hour before closing on weekdays). The cappuccino is good too but nothing beats their coffee. Must try!"}
{"text":"Looking for a brunch spot? Definitely give Cafe Moulin a try!! It's a small, but great place off of Walnut St in Shadyside. When I say it's a small cafe space, I mean SMALL. There's a few tables, and i would say it's not as accommodating for larger crowds, but for a group of two or three, I would highly recommend! The menu has a variety of different breakfast and brunch plates, but CREPES are the way to go! I had the Halle Berry (Nutella, and Strawberries) and it was incredible  Can't wait to get back there and try a new sweet treat!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm not a fan of Cafe Moulin but am torn between 2 and 3 stars..... I don't like going there, but I know others don't hate it....Okay so I guess I'll make a pros and cons list:  PROS:  -Nice atmosphere (aesthetically appealing and clean). -Food is consistent. -Coffee is great.  CONS: -Usually a very long wait time. You'll wait to get seated and you'll wait to get food.  -Very small restaurant with limited seating. -The food is average. I've never had anything \"bad\" but I haven't had anything that was really good either. I've had different crepes and they're all pretty basic and average tasting. I finish my plate, but am usually underwhelmed.  -The service can be bad. Not just bad because they're slow, which isn't always their fault, but bad as in rude and sometimes they seem agitated. I've had some pleasant interactions, but generally they are very curt and don't seem to care that much about how they interact. Example: A server didn't bring me an item I ordered when other drinks were brought to the table. I flagged him and politely asked for my item, and was told that he \"knows and it's coming.\" And then there was this ::eyeroll:: and it just describes the service you can expect to get every once and a while at Cafe Moulin.  If you want crepes and Cafe Moulin isn't busy, you can try their crepes without fear of food poisoning or being dramatically disappointed. If it's busy, I would consider waiting in line elsewhere."}
{"text":"So the crepes here were okay - nothing I couldn't make myself at home. When I walked in, it looked cute and trendy but nothing could have prepared me for how long we had to wait to get our order taken and subsequently wait for the food. I think the whole experience took about 2 hours which is just not acceptable. The flavors were a bit bland (I can't even remember what I ordered I just ate in fury, fuming at how long it took).  There are plenty of other crepe places in Pittsburgh that can serve you in a timely fashion. Advice to this restaurant? Don't seat people until you know you can serve them. I'd rather be told upfront there will be a 40 minute + wait than to be seated so then I can decide if I want to do that or not..."}
{"text":"Went today for brunch- lots of people, but the wait was not too bad at all.   Once inside, I had the Alaksa - a savory crêpe with smoked salmon, herb cream cheese and spinach and a cappuccino and was so pleased with my meal. My friend also got a savory crêpe (can't remember which!) and a latte and she loved it too. One of my favorite parts of my meal was the dressing on the salad that accompanies the savory items. So good! Our service was awesome too -will definitely return."}
{"text":"Wife & I ventured into Shadyside for some post Christmas shopping.  Found his spot thanks to a sign on the street corner & glad we tried it out.  Crepes were BOMB!   I had banana, peanut butter & chocolate (variation of the banella) add 2 eggs & bacon.  Wife had the Bristol.  Two thumbs up to both meals.   The place has character & the staff was friendly.   Had to dock them a star as I asked for hot sauce and they charged me $1.50 and the bacon was thin & not very good.  Other than that - crepes were"}
{"text":"This place is cute and a perfect place to drop in for breakfast/brunch. I discovered it for the first time today and I ordered the cheesecake crepe which was divine! Service felt a little slow, however. We sat for a while before ordering and food took a while, which the waiter even commented on and thanked us for not complaining. It also seemed confusing as to who would be serving us at first but for 12:40 on Sunday we got right in with not wait. I will definitely go again and bring my parents along."}
{"text":"This place just opened and a friend and I stopped in for breakfast today. We were both very pleasantly surprised by the experience. I had an crepe omelette, with roasted chicken, avocado and spinach and it was fabulous. Eggs were fluffy, and the ingredients were of very high quality and ample - I needed to take half with me for lunch.  I lived in France for four years and have eaten at many creperies; this one is really impressive and worth supporting! My Cafe Latte was excellent as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a variety of crepes sweet or savory, French toast and much more. I had the posh panini , it tasted great, the Ingredients were fresh. The server's were quite friendly, and the food came out quite fast . All in all it great lunch, and I would definitely return and recommend this place to others ."}
{"text":"We were in a hurry, and they served us quickly. Everyone had a sweet version of crepes or french toast.  I had the super belgium crepe with cookie butter (where have you been all my life) it came with chocolate and strawberries, drizzled in chocolate.  My daughter had the french toast with goat cheese and raspberry compote, my other daughter had a crepe with honey walnuts & granola, and another friend had the Hally Berry crepe (nutella and strawberries). All fantastic!"}
{"text":"It's pretty much every man for himself on arrival.  Waited at least 10 or 15 mins before waitress came over to take names.  If I hadn't shouted to her that we had been waiting, she'd have seated others who came in after us first.  They need a greeter on busy days to avoid chaos.  I ordered a crepe with fire roasted chicken and harissa.  If there was three ounces of chicken, i'd be surprised, more likely two.  I spent most of my meal thinking, well, there'll probably be some in the next bite. Don't get me wrong, the crepes are good, but prices are a bit high to be skimping.  Paid extra for avocado and literally got about a sixth of a small avocado.  Yes, Americans are spoiled on portion size, but this place needs to get a clue."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and cozy inside, stuff is very friendly, delicious food and latte. I will definitely come back with my friends. My new favorite place in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, but the service was poor. They only had one waiter and though he was nice,  it took us about 20 minutes to get our check after I had asked several times."}
{"text":"I've been to Cafe Moulin a couple of times, both of them with friends. The atmosphere is cute and charming, which makes it great for social gatherings. It's also next to a bunch of shops that you can visit before or after your meal.  Personally, I felt the food was average. I got the Marseille crepe, which felt a little heavy on the harissa. It came with a small side of greens. The portions are enough, but probably won't fill you up if you're arriving ravenous or have a larger appetite."}
{"text":"Walk downstairs and enter deliciousness.... Café Moulin is an excellent spot for a weekday breakfast. I came here on a Monday with a friend and was seated immediately. The service is friendly and fast, and the wait staff didn't mind answering a lot of questions for first timers (no the sausage is not spicy, yes dark chocolate pairs as well with raspberry as white chocolate does). I had the French toast, specifically the Mykonos Platter, and it was absolutely delicious. The sausage was tasty and the perfect portion. And, while I typically don't go for the pricier beverages, if you are a fan of chai and don't get the chai tea latte you are absolutely doing yourself a disservice. This was one of the best chai teas I have ever tasted.... ever.... and I drink a lot of chai anywhere I go. If it was just a bit less expensive, I might have crossed into five stars but this is definitely a shadyside breakfast experience worth having!"}
{"text":"Love the design, but the food was meh. I had one of their savory crepes and it was just bland. It came with an avocado and it wasn't ripe enough.  I've had waffles at this place before and they were yummy, plus the service is great - very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"It is certainly something different from the restaurants in the area and hence, it attracts a lot of people.  The choices are very good and tasty (even though mainly towards the heavy, unhealthy but delicious side).  However, the main drawback of this place is the service.  I understand that it is very busy at times but it is extraordinarily inefficient.  Even though when there are plenty of tables open it seems that it takes forever to get seated. I am not sure whether it is a policy of the owner in order to appear as there is a line and creating the physiological effect on potential customers that this place must be nice but it is something that can turn customers away. Overall I think I will give it again another chance but maybe not during rush hours."}
{"text":"I love a good crepe and Cafe Moulin had pretty solid sweet and savory choices. We were expecting a wait, but we were seated right away. I was with a group and we had a mix of the sweet and savory crepes, plus a fruit bowl and Nutella hot chocolates.   Everything was okay but nothing stood out. Cafe Moulin is a bit on the pricier side, but when you're the only crepe joint in town you probably can get away with that. The portion sizes are pretty underwhelming for the price - I'm not someone that likes to feel disgustingly full after a meal, so that's okay, but I do wish the crepes were priced a bit lower. Definitely not the best crepes I've ever had, but something different for brunch than your standard diner food.  I'm not dying to go back but if a friend wanted to, I'd return."}
{"text":"I tried the ham and swiss crêpe and a cappuccino today. They were both okay, but I wasn't overly impressed - the cappuccino was not one of the better ones I've had in the area, and the crêpe had a big thick (1/2 inch?) slice of ham in it, complete with gristly bits which were hard to cut. At other places, it's usually thin sliced luncheon meats which I think works better in this scenario. The side salad it comes with was fine, but not especially exciting. On the plus side, they have a couple of outdoor tables which work well on a pleasant day, and the interior has an appealing cozy ambience. The service was also prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my custom omelet today with smoked salmon, turkey, spinach and avocado.  The waiter was excellent and rather funny. This place can get busy, but moves fast if the party is small."}
{"text":"A great place to have breakfast, the crepes are made in the moment and the coffee is delicious. We went near thanksgiving so we got their delicious home made cranberry sauce. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a phenomenal French breakfast and brunch stop just off Walnut Street in Shadyside.  It's clear others feel the same as weekend visits will have a slight wait, but it's definitely worth it.   The place serves savory and sweet crepes and french toast, along with some other breakfast-type items.  All of them are delicious...the challenge is just picking one of them!  I'd recommend leaving young ones at home for this place, however this is a GREAT spot for breakfast with your love, a few friends, or mom and dad.   That said, I know I certainly can't wait until my next visit!  The crepes are incredible!"}
{"text":"Cafe Moulin is my favorite breakfast place in Shadyside. You walk down the steps into cute substreet level dining area with a space that can seat about 30 people. The setting is warm and open with plenty of natural sunlight shining into room and warm lightly colored wood floor.  Quickly one of the bohemian waiters asks for you drinks and give you what I call an amazing menu. One side will have sweet crepes, from nutella, banana and fresh strawberries, where as the other side will have the savory flavors. Being a savory girl myself there is plenty of variety to choose from. Be warned, these are large and creamy. Most will have a sauce of sorts whether the herb creme spread of alaskan crepe or the bechamel that drenches the Bristol. Your tongue will have plenty to taste. Having been here 3 times, I have enjoyed each of my choices and always left plenty full. When you need to break it up you much on the side salad that home with a house dressing. All very delicious.  Now to my favorite part of Cafe Moulin. They will do a Turkish Coffee fortune reading for you with the purchase of your coffee. Turkish coffee is brewed thick and grainy and sweetened for you. They will ask for light, medium or heavy sweet flavoring. You get it in a small 8 oz cup where you sip, sip, sip until only the bottom coffee granularity remains. Now, you quickly flip over you cup and wait for the grains to make their way down your cup. Depending on your personality and the spread at which you sip your coffee, the cup and therefore the grains will be a different temperature and therefore either make it down your cup more quickly or less quickly.   The girl will come over when you have waited the appropriate amount of time and will \"read your fortune\" .... I love having my fortune read. The girl is obviously not an expert and knows this cute party trick for her own fun, but either way, it's still pretty neat and a perk to your food.  Will come often again."}
{"text":"Great place! We were able to get in before the crowd on a Sunday morning and had our choice of tables. The staff was very friendly and the food came in just a few minutes.   We ordered two crepes and both were fantastic! Bristol - Smoked turkey, goat cheese, avocado and bechamel sauce. YUM! Ham and Swiss Cheese - Ham, Swiss cheese and honey aioli. Also YUM!  I had a hot tea and my friend tried the coffee - both good options! I definitely recommend heading there for brunch when in Shadyside!"}
{"text":"Decided to grab breakfast here today on a whim and oh my goodness am I glad I did! The food here was so delicious! I meant to take a picture but I ate it too fast! The staff here are incredibly nice and the atmosphere is so laid back! I had the Amsterdam French toast and that Turkish sausage is basically like chorizo so if that's your speed, I highly recommend it! My breakfast date had the Belgium crepe with cookie butter - and it was also phenomenal! I will definitely be coming back any time I'm craving crepes for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Cafe Moulin for lunch with my parents earlier today.  I was hoping for a quick and light lunch, and having read some of the other reviews, was concerned that the quick part might not happen.  My fears were confirmed when we walked in and, after getting a waitress's attention after standing in the front for five minutes, were told that the wait would be 25 min.  I asked my parents if they wanted to go somewhere else nearby, but they wanted to wait it out.  I think we waited about 20 min. to be seated, but even a wait of that length wasn't necessary, given that several tables sat vacant for part of the wait.  Also, despite keeping a list, the waitstaff couldn't keep the order of arrival straight, such that we the customers had to remind them of who had been waiting longest.  Once we finally were seated, service wasn't the most efficient, either.  For our entrees, my mom ordered the Halle Berry crepe (strawberries, Nutella, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream; $8.35), my dad ordered the Bristol crepe (smoked turkey, goat cheese, avocado, and bechamel; $9.50), and I ordered the Alaskan crepe (smoked salmon, herbed cream cheese, and spinach; $10.50).  Both savory crepes came with a small side salad, which was a nice accompaniment.  While the quality was alright, it wasn't anything to write home about.  While my parents enjoyed their crepes, they didn't rave about them, so I think we were on the same page there.  Overall, I wasn't overly impressed with my experience at Cafe Moulin, particularly in terms of the service.  It took us an hour and a half from the time of arrival to the time that we left, which is just too much time for lunch.  While I get that they're busy, it's clear that the management needs to do a better job of providing organized and prompt customer service.  Quite frankly, if it were up to me, I wouldn't have stuck around--I would have simply gone up the street to grab lunch elsewhere.  As it were, I doubt I'll return, given that I live two blocks away from Crepes Parisiennes, which is higher quality, cheaper, and quicker--not to mention closer--to boot."}
{"text":"Cafe Moulin is a cute little brunch spot with a long wait. But if you stay inside and put your name on the list, you can get seated within 15 minutes.   My sister and I visited Cafe Moulin before we headed to the airport to leave Pittsburg. I ordered the Bristol - Smoked turkey, goat cheese, avocado and béchamel sauce and a side of bacon,  a Nutella hot chocolate, and she ordered a dessert crepe which was filled with cookie butter and topped with bananas and strawberries (sorry I forgot the name).  The Bristol was surprisingly underwhelming. The béchamel was a little bland and did not go as well with the turkey and avocado as I was hoping it would. Eating the bacon with it, gave it a better taste to me, but then I felt like I was eating a turkey, bacon & avocado sandwich. :(  My sister's crepe was really good and was a good way to satisfy a sweet tooth without feeling too heavy. I really enjoyed this one.  The Nutella hot chocolate was good, but something I could have easily made at home. The bacon was bacon. No complaints there :) The total came out to $27 ish dollars. I love affordable, so no complaints there either.   I won't write off Cafe Moulin just yet, but would probably go with something more unusual when picking another savory crepe to try."}
{"text":"This is a quaint breakfast spot in Shadyside.  I got the Walnut Street French toast and it was really good.  In fact the food is quite delicious... so why 3-stars?  This is a rally small Resturaunt and the wait is long!!!! That said, if you don't mind standing for a while ... enjoy."}
{"text":"Shadyside of Pittsburgh! Beautiful area to walk, shop and live if you're moving to the area! Slightly off the main strip in a walk down basement venue. Service was excellent, these folks know what they're doing. The food was outstanding I had the Alaskan crepe with egg and avocado. Plenty of food you will not leave hungry. They did a nice job of recreating a French atmosphere and environment."}
{"text":"Stopped in to this cute little downstairs location for a light lunch and had a delightful experience. Savory crepes were delicious and served with a very fresh and tasty side salad. Even the iced tea was extra good. Pleasant service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came on a Tuesday morning. There was no wait and the service was very attentive and friendly. The atmosphere was nice, they were playing jazz music which I enjoyed.   I ordered the Bristol crepe with the sausage on the side. It was very good and filling. My latte was amazing!  Next time I will try the Turkish coffee, my waitress offered to read my fortune in the espresso grounds :)"}
{"text":"It takes FOREVER!!!! I arrived at 10:00 and did not get our food at 11:00. They said it's \"computer problem\".... Poor service"}
{"text":"So, I was gonna have a picture but I started to eat it before I remembered and I just think it's tacky to take pictures of half eaten food. Anyway, this was my first time to Pittsburgh and I was going to go to Pamela's because I heard it's an institution here. However, they had a wait out the door and ain't nobody bout that life. So I walked around the corner and found this little gem. I am sat immediately because you always have princess VIP status when you're a party of one. I ultimately decided on the Ottawa crepe which is brie and eggs inside with bacon on top. I got fancy and decided to add raspberry compote on top. I HIGHLY recommend it that way. Otherwise, it may be a little average. The salty sweet combo is supreme. This place is cute. The wait staff is personable. I recommend it as a decent crepe place. When I come back to Pittsburgh, I probably will find a new spot. Not because it's bad but because I like to eat my way through cities one restaurant at a time. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for breakfast and it was amazing! We all ordered sweet crepes and it was actually really good. These are not average crepes; you will actually enjoy your food. The prices aren't too bad and the atmosphere and staff are very cozy."}
{"text":"I don't give many 5 stars, but this place truly deserves it! Everything from being seated to paying the bill was pleasant.  My Cappuccino was just the right temp and strength.  My husband said the Turkish house coffee was delish.  I went for a sweet crepe and got the Walnut St with added dark chocolate.  The combo of walnuts, granola, caramel and brie was heaven! Mike went for savory and had the Sofia.  It was a crepe filled with eggs, harissa and sauted veg. It was served with fruit and Turkish sausage.  We arrived at 9 when the opened and within 10 minutes they were full and had a line.  Arrive early and go often!"}
{"text":"Great coffee here- cafe au lait was perfect.  Crepes were well executed- but fillings were a little odd.  Still tasty.  The service was totally fine.  All in all- a great neighborhood find"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere here are amazing. I had the Amsterdam French Toast breakfast with scrambled eggs and Turkish sausage. Everything was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful. This is a small establishment so you can expect to wait a little for a table. The short wait was certainly worth it.  Once inside the service was prompt and friendly. I will most definitely dine here again.  Hopefully soon!!"}
{"text":"I loved their decor. The service was really good food came out really quick! I wasn't expecting it to come out this quick. I had the Alaskan and my husband had the chicken can't seem to remember the name of the dish but both of them were good! Overall and good place!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I go to this place all the time to get some crêpe. The staff are a pretty nice day really friendly and they're always quick. Recommended"}
{"text":"We gave Cafe Moulin a second chance. The manager replied to my previous review and requested we give them a second chance and assured us that things would be different and we wanted to give them another opportunity .  We went this afternoon and things were different right from the start. We had the same waitress, who told us to sit anywhere we wish. We received cold water and each ordered a different ice tea.  Both were served promptly and were delicious. Our waitress was extremely friendly and took good care of us.  I ordered the same crepe as last time, the Cheesecake, with the same request of no chocolate, and was told no problem. V ordered a savory crepe. Both came out exactly as ordered and delicious. Mine was so good that I even had some friendly assistance finishing it!  Overall, this experience made up completely for what happened last time. The manager lived up to his word and delivered a great experience both in terms of service and food. I guess this goes to show that it is always worth giving a second chance, especially when management was so quick to apologize after our last experience instead of just dismissing our comments.   I am not sure how review updates work, if this score will replace my old one as I hope or if I need to delete my previous review because I feel that it no longer represents this restaurant. All of the issues I mentioned in my first review have been addressed and corrected and I recommend Cafe Moulin to anyone who wants a nice crepe, savory or sweet, or a nice french toast. They have a great selection of tea, that they can serve iced (I am a tea fanatic) so give this cozy cafe a try."}
{"text":"Cafe moulin was pretty tasty but overpriced. I ordered the walnut street crepe which I enjoyed and my husband ordered a savory crepe that he said was okay. The trick to the best deal is to come here when you're craving a sweet breakfast I would say. The Nutella hot chocolate was sinful. I will definitely be going back to try some more!"}
{"text":"It is a cute place with nice ambience. It was a bit understaffed so wait time for service was longer than usual.   The food is priced alright, though it is not the most amazing food. If the service was a bit faster, it would be a great place to stop in for a quick bite before some shopping."}
{"text":"Nutella!! Cookie Butter!!  Crepes!! Seriously, who would not love it here? Love the banelle (banana and Nutella crepe) and the French toast with strawberries is cooked perfectly. The staff is just so nice as well! Don't be put off by the basement entrance: it's actually quite cozy and inviting once you get inside. The house ice tea is refreshing and the Nutella hot chocolate is fabulous.  Did I forget to mention the Nutella menu items?! They have a nice list of savory items as well but they always get me at \"Nutella\"!  Kid friendly and free wi-fi"}
{"text":"Came in on Easter Sunday for a late lunch. Their menu, while not the biggest, certainly offers something for everyone. Both sweet and savory crepes had good options and we went w/ the Ham and Swiss as well as the Marseille. On the side was the classic French toast and a cup of mocha. The crepes were delicious and packed full of good flavors, wouldn't hesitate ordering them again next time I go. French toast was good too, paired w/ syrup and banana slices, even though I'm not the biggest fan of French toast in general. Service was decent, w/ only the initial getting menus/orders in being slightly slower than I would've liked."}
{"text":"I ate the Marseille crepe Fire roasted chicken Swiss cheese caramelized onions and Harissa sauce.   It was are very good crepe, texture was very enjoyable and perfect size, it's comes with side salad that's somewhat spicy! Yummy.  Very quaint good for brunch with friends"}
{"text":"Cafe Moulin is a nice little spot off of Walnut. If you're in the mood for savory or sweet crepes, this is the place for you. I ordered Mykonos French Toast platter, which is basically 2 pieces of French Toast with 4 little pieces of sausage. The menu says \"spicy\" sausage, but it pretty much taste like kielbasa. It was a fine meal, but I'm not dying to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The savory crepes are so die for. Best crepes in Pittsburgh. I highly recommend trying the Marseille, chicken savory crepe which is very decadent. Also there house coffee is much better then other breakfast places"}
{"text":"Had to come here after seeing the pictures on their Yelp page of the Crepes.  Needless to say, this place did not disappoint. Great atmosphere and the food was phenomenal. My entire party was blown away with the crepes.  Safe to say I will be back.   Crepes are a must."}
{"text":"Crepes are excellent. The only problem is the seating arrangement and long wait."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing; both the crepes and the French toast. The wait staff is great, Carl is funny and helpful. The only con is that it is small place so the wait times can be long."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly and welcoming. I had the Alaskan crepe, with eggs and avocado, and it was delicious. The prices are pretty good, ~$25 for two. Definitely prefer this place to Pamela's"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars, I would!  For a very busy place we got in pretty quick for Sunday brunch.  We were seated outside which we really enjoyed because it was so nice out.  We both got iced tea (ginger peach and pomegranate).  I enjoyed that the tea was flavored naturally and not by using sweet syrups. Made fresh to order. They were so full of flavor and we'd return for the tea alone.  We ordered the otowa crepe and the Bristol crepe (added egg) and both were fantastic.  The fruit on my plate was very fresh and delicious also.  Service was fast, and attentive despite how busy they were.  I have zero complaints about this place and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Got the Alaskan Crepes Omelette, was alright, no frills. The omelette part  is really tender and good, but didn't really like the salmon in them, a tad too salty for my taste, the coffee is nice. All in all wasn't that impressed."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and every time I go, I am not disappointed! I am a sweet person, so the raspberry cheesecake crepe is my favorite! I will continue to take clients here for a nice treat."}
{"text":"Cafe Moulin is a hidden gem on Walnut Street. I can honestly say I have never experienced better crepes anywhere else in Pittsburgh, and I became a regular for brunch quite quickly.  The staff is always very friendly, and the food never takes longer than 10 minutes to receive, even when every table in the restaurant is full. There's a lot of menu options and you can customize your own crepe, or you can have waffles, French toast, or a panini if that more fits your style!  I tend to order a savory crepe for protein and a dessert crepe for my sweet tooth when I go because it's too hard to pick just one. I highly recommend everyone to try the Super Belgium because their Belgium cookie spread literally melts in your mouth, it's unbelievable!  Prices are fair for the amount you get, and they accept both cash and cards. Happy Brunching!"}
{"text":"Ducked in for a coffee and found a great French breakfast.  Little bit of Paris in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere of this brunch spot and the crepes and coffee were delicious. However, the wait staff came across as rude considering we were rushed out immediately after paying our bill when we were told that another party was waiting for our table."}
{"text":"What a quaint little place this is. Very tasty everything! We liked it so much, especially the sausage. Wow! Unlike any sausage I've ever eaten. Every employee in there was welcoming and friendly as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We came here after biking the morning and didn't expect nearly what we got. My partner and I both got the Ottawa crepe (3 eggs, Brie and bacon) and an order of the Barcelona French toast to share. Both were beyond amazing - the raspberry compote combined with goat cheese on the Barcelona is such a unique and flavorful combination. We would definitely get either of these dishes again and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"You could not fail if you choose a super Belgium crepe. It's sooooooo good!! All waitress were kind too."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday with my girlfriend for brunch. Wait time was not terrible, about 25 minutes.   The place has a nice ambiance, but it seems understaffed. It took the server about 15 minutes just to get us water.   I got the Nutella hot chocolate which was delicious. It was not too sweet and had a nice hint of nutella.   We split 3 dishes between the two of us. The Marseille crepe was nice and the side salad was good. The French Walnut Street French toast was a bit heavy for both of our tastes and extremely savory. We did not like it that much. The Super Belgium sweet crepe was also very savory. I did not like it that much, but my girlfriend liked it.   If you do not have a sweet tooth, I would recommend to keep to the savory crepes.  When we left, nobody greeted us out.  Nobody took my money, so we just left the money on the table and left. I thought this was slightly unprofessional and rude. Like I said, they seem understaffed."}
{"text":"The cafe is charming. The staff are pleasant and the crepes are delicious! I had the Halle berry and a vanilla chai both very good. I will be back to try the savory crepes!"}
{"text":"There crepes are amazing!! I got great Belgium for the first time and Alaskan with eggs for the second time. Love walnut street only because of all the great restaurants you can check out here!"}
{"text":"Great little place, that you'll easily miss if you don't know it's there. Expect to wait, especially on a Saturday or Sunday morning, just be sure you don't leave. Awesome French toast and crepes. A little slice of Paris in the heart of Shadyside."}
{"text":"2nd time visiting and eating there overall and best best best place to eat! Food is deliciously great"}
{"text":"I came to Cafe Moulin on a couple of different occasions but mostly for brunch. While there is usually a wait, I have never experienced a wait longer than 15-20 min. Now most of the brunch places do not take reservations and Cafe Moulin is no different. I have had a couple of their savory and sweet crepes, coffee and also their french toast. All that I have had so far was fresh, light and very delicious, but specifically the French Toast was definitely my favorite. I also much prefer Cafe Moulin's crepes over Crepe Parisienne in Oakland. Much better quality, fresher ingredients and nicer atmosphere. I find the staff very friendly and approachable. Last time we were 3 people and in order to get in quicker we were sitting at the \"bar\" right next to the kitchen. It was a bit uncomfortable for 3 people (but that was our fault as we asked to sit there) so as soon as we spotted a table becoming available we asked the owner if it would be possible to switch and it was absolutely no problem at all. Every time I am here I feel welcomed and the food is amazing. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"The best crapes in Pittsburgh!! The vanilla lattes are delicious- I always want more!   The service is excellent and the atmosphere is so quant. It's my favorite breakfast/ brunch place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been eating brunch here for a year now. It is our go to favorite brunch spot. We always get the same crêpe and it always comes to us hot and delicious. The quality of food is always the same and the staff is nice. We will always come back for more!!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to go out for breakfast today, and this place did not disappoint! The atmosphere is a bit dark, but eyes adjusted easily. A lot of deep, rich wood work and interesting art cover the walls. It is a generally small place, down a set of stairs off of the main street.   I came with my friend and we split the two meals. I ordered a create your own crepe, which I got honey, granola, strawberries and whipped cream on top. My friend ordered the classic french toast with bananas. Wow! It was so good. The crepe was perfectly cooked. The french toast had a hint of cinnamon in it, which made it even warmer tasting and more delicious. I had a good experience and would definitely return."}
{"text":"I am writing the same review for Cafe Moulin and Crepes Parisiennes.  To me, they both have excellent crepes and coffee. And I have happy to go into either of them any day. The only difference is where I am at the time, and how big a party I have.   Crepes Parisiennes is on S Craig St. Street parking if you are driving and good luck finding a space on Craig. The shops have ~10 tables, and its customer base is Pitt + CMU + UPMC.  Small shop means it is likely packed.  Go in, line-up, order, find a table, and they bring the food to you when ready.  Definitely should try this out if you are a student nearby.  Cafe Moulin is in Shadyside, Walnut Street area, next to a parking lot. About ~25 tables I guess.  At least I never have to wait in the line.  Go in, they will find you a table, and the waiter will take your order and bring the food over.  If you are driving, or with a big party (6+), I would prefer Cafe Moulin.  Foodwise, cappuccino, Latte, chocolate strawberry crepe, smoked salmon crepe... I am going to say Cafe Moulin's smoked salmon crepe (Alaskan) has more salmon than Crepes Parisiennes... but it is also more expensive ($11 vs $10)... and it might be just that day.  So don't take my words for it."}
{"text":"We came at 9 AM (when they open) and the place filled up in less than 30 minutes- come early if you hate waiting like me. Service was prompt and friendly.   We tried the Walnut St. French Toast with brie, walnuts, maple butter and granola. I think this was my favorite. We also got 2 crepes: Tivoli (pesto, tomatoes, spinach, mozzarella) and Bristol (smoked turkey, bechemel sauce, goat cheese, avocado). I thought both were underwhelming. I also could get a crepe 2x that size for the same price in another city."}
{"text":"Cafe Moulin makes me smile. They are doing classic French crepes right! The menu has an extensive list of both sweet and savory crepes. The ingredients are fresh and perfectly cooked.  Add an egg to any crepe for an additional $2. I suggest you do this because it was the silkiest, most perfectly cooked egg I've ever had. The beschemel and goat cheese added to the creaminess. It just made me happy. I want to mention that we had the greatest waiter. He was super helpful and attentive and he spoke to me in French, for anyone that knows me this was the cherry! I can't wait to go back and try more crepes!"}
{"text":"Excelente lugar. Comida deliciosa, trato amable. Definitivamente un lugar al que regresaría. Me encantó el local.... con calefacción y muy acogedor. La comida es sabrosa con mezclas de dulce y salado lo cual le da ese toque innovador."}
{"text":"Great little place with great food. Although the restaurant is in a basement it feels more like a little hideaway the. A dungeon. The crepes are amazing both the savory and sweet. Coffee was above par and unlimited."}
{"text":"I was craving for some chocolate and decided on Banella. It was exactly what I needed because it was overloaded with Nutella (in a good way ;) ). Would love to come back and try something else on the menu too."}
{"text":"Exceptional breakfast!!!! ALWAYS consistent. The staff very accommodating. The best breakfast in Shadyside Love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The service here was unbearably slow even though it really wasn't that crowded. The hazlenut hot chocolate was mind blowingly delicious. 'ow-(h)ever..(I had to get Jamaican for a second) it was probably about 50 percent foam. Not cool!   I really couldn't understand why three crepes (one with strawberries, bananas, and Nutella; one with bananas and nutella; and one whose ingredients escape me but called for brie on the menu)  took so long to come out. How difficult it is to make a crepe? I'd imagine that the batter is pre-made and all you have to do is cook it and fill it. Our order took over 30 minutes. Not only was the service slow, but my sister's friend, specifically asked for no brie in his because he cannot have dairy products. Sure enough, it was in there and he had to continue to wait.  Once you get past the slow service, the food was quite good. I was glad that we stumbled across it, but it ate into the little time that I had left and did not allow for all the things that I had hoped to do before my flight left. *le sigh* C'est la vie..."}
{"text":"Great service and amazingly fresh for a subterranean grotto.  Well worth a visit. We had the house salad accented with avocado and feta and the spinach tomato pesto cheese crepe and crepe with strawberries and Nutella for a grand finish.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Delicious place~ The food here looks beautiful! And they are delicious. I had walnut French toast. It was  soft and sweet. But the vanilla latte was just mediocre. The sofia crepe was also really good. The egg was tender and they added spicy sauce on the side.  But the place is really small. Come early! We had a tight schedule so we had to sit at the side bar. But overall, it was a delightful meal!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff. Strawberry/ chocolate crepe was amazing. Gave me complimentary coffee while I waited for my to go. Freshly brewed at that"}
{"text":"It's always packed on weekends, and for good reason. PB&J crepes are a game-changer. I haven't gone the savory route yet, but I plan to soon.  If you're headed there on a weekend for brunch, be patient - it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Probably some of the worst service I have ever received.   Stood in a long line (which was growing by the second) for 10-15 minutes, and there was no host/hostess in sight. No one was taking names or anything. Waiters and waitresses walked past us without a second glance. One couple decided to just sit themselves. I finally went up to a waitress and asked, \"Do we have to stand in line or does someone take our names down?\"  ...and she tells us she will put our names on the list (then doesn't ask for anyone else to be put on the list). We wait another 20-30 minutes and watch as others in line become frustrated and leave as they realize no one is attending to the line of hungry people. Basically you had to stand in line, to wave down a waitress and request to be put on a list.  We are finally seated and have our order taken (we request some waters and coffee). After 15 minutes we flag down the waitress and request our waters and coffee again--seems we had been forgotten, as others who arrived after us had already been served.   I ordered the cheesecake crepe and it was disgustingly sweet with mounds of white chocolate chips and almost no marscapone cheese.   Overall, there was no organization or customer service. Probably won't be back here again.."}
{"text":"Very pleased. The menu has a great deal of options for being only 2 pages. The mix of classic style crepes and exotic options makes this a great go to plce. They even have a great deal of lunch options. Don't be fooled though their breakfast crepes easily can suffice as a lunch. I had the Sofia  (because it's in the only country on the menu I had not been). It had very delicious Turkish sausage and a vegetable omelet encased in a crepe that was fill with harissa (a red paste hot sauce ) it was incredible. We will be back for a almost traditional walnut french toast next."}
{"text":"Very great place to get some brunch. Their savory crepes are to die for! Also anything from the coffee drink menu is really good."}
{"text":"** Hip brunch spot with many choices for french toast and crepes. Smaller place that can have a wait on weekends.  I love brunch but I am not always a morning person, especially on the weekends. After a few failed attempts, I finally made it one weekend, and Im glad that I had the opportunity to eat here. I ordered the classic french toast and added strawberries ($9 total), which I think made it a lot better because the french toast by itself might have been a bit plain.   The pieces were really thick and decently filling. Typically I do not like to eat things that are overly sweet and more subtle in flavor, and the french toast here is kind of like that. I actually ended up using most if not all of of the whipped cream and syrup, which is typically rare for me.  I also ordered the Nutella Hot Chocolate Cappuccino which I didn't particularly like... I guess this one was a bit too plain and I was expecting it to be a bit sweeter or have more flare. Didn't think the drink was worth $2.50.    Not the cheapest place so I wouldn't eat here too often but its a nice experience overall and I would definitely be down to try one of the sweet crepes in the future."}
{"text":"I dined at Cafe Moulin with my extremely picky grandmother. The fact that she was a fan of everything was enough to make it a great experience. I ordered the tomato and cheese crepe and it was delicious. The small salad was a great compliment to the crepe."}
{"text":"i finally got the chance to visit cafe moulin for the first time today! the waitress was really friendly and super adorable. she was always available and didn't keep us waiting. i ordered the halle berry crepe with a house coffee (very rich with free refills!!), and my boyfriend ordered the sofia. mine came with a side of bacon, and he had some fruit on the side, so we both had some sweet and savory flavors. overall, the food was DELICIOUS, and the atmosphere was cheery and relaxing. if you pay by card, they bring a touch pad to your table to have you pay and sign electronically (which i love-- SUPER efficient). its location is great as well. i will definitely be stopping in the next time i get my nails done or am shopping down walnut street!"}
{"text":"Hmmm where to start. Being positive, the food was good and the coffee was hot. But my service, man it was horrible. It took 15 min to get our lattes, my friend ordered a coffee and got a latte, asked for a coffee again (not drinking the latte) and was charged for a latter not a coffee.   The female waitress wasn't friendly at all. It seemed as though it was only her waiting tables whilst a gentlemen was seating people (he was friendly).   Although the food was great, I won't return because of the bad service. I mean even though my taste buds were happy, waiting 30 min for waffles while hungry is just ridiculous."}
{"text":"This place has always been a go to spot for me for crepes! My favorite is the Marseille. But did they change the recipe? I could have sworn it didn't have zucchini in it before. The harissa sauce was DEFINITELY different, in fact, it was that roster hot sauce. I'm really sad about the lack of harissa. Other than that service is always great and food is good."}
{"text":"Pitt/CMU students, Crepes Parisiennes is closer. However, their quality and quantity are both significantly lacking. Try this little hole-in-the-wall place off of Walnut Street instead.   It's got tons more menu items, which all look pretty delicious. I've had a Belgian white chocolate crepe and a French Toast order with the Turkish sausage I can't remember the name of. It's halal, that's all I remember. Friendly, efficient service. Good portion sizes! Overall, a nice little hangout. Just take the 71B or 71D over, and you won't regret it.   It's not very full in the morning hours, so you'll have plenty of space to spread out, too!"}
{"text":"First off this is an awesome place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. A competitor to Pamela's and De Luca's that have ruled the breakfast and brunch scene in Pittsburgh for a while, hope Moulin gradually expands to seat more people, simply because of the quality of comfort food that comes out of their kitchen is amazing. I visited Cafe Moulin on a Sunday afternoon, still packed at 2:00pm. Needless to say they are tiny and in a basement but with a really nice quaint feeling to the place. They have a decent sized list of sweet and savory crepes and french toast. I tried the Marseille Crepe with eggs and fruit and the Classic French Toast both of which were delightful. The Marseille is a savory crepe with roasted chicken, swiss cheese, caramelized onions & harissa sauce. The spice of the sauce and beautifully cooked eggs complimented each other perfectly. The crepe itself was thin and light, letting the roasted chicken filling drive the flavor of the dish, served with a side of salad or fruit -  makes you want to go back for more. The Classic Toast is basically two slices of their special bread, soaked in egg batter & maple butter, served with whipped cream. It was battered to perfection and fried to melt as bite into it. Their home brewed organic coffee gives you a good start to an even better breakfast and brunch. I'd rate them a 4.5 over all. A must try if you're in the burgh."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. There was not one disappointed person that left from this venture! My party of four came on a Saturday lunch at around 12 pm and had to wait quite a bit for a table, but once we were seated, everything ran smoothly. I ordered the Walnut Street crepe and my friends ordered the classic French toast, Ottawa crepe and Tivoli crepe. My friend also ordered the Turkish coffee. The Walnut crepe was very sweet and filling; the texture of the crunch and the soft crepe were complimentary. I tasted the other dishes as well and will praise the savory crepes! I wished I had gotten that instead.  The Turkish coffee was a bit odd though. At the bottom the coffee grinds were left behind and they looked like dirt and tasted sooo bitter! We've never had a Turkish coffee so maybe that's the style? It was amusing trying to taste the grinds and figure out what to do with it. Overall it was a good experience. The food was fairly priced and tasted incredible! I would just come at a better time so our wait would not be so long."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the Shadyside shopping district and very near my hair salon (Whitehouse Salon -- highly recommended BTW) so stopped for lunch after getting my new hairdo.  The place is tiny but inviting.  As it was just myself, I opted for counter space sitting on a stool with no back, but there are several tables with chairs, as well.  The menu options are mostly crepes, divided into sweet and savory.  I opted for the Tivoli, a savory crepe with mozzarella, spinach, and tomato, with pesto sauce.  I wish they would use the Oxford comma because it is confusing on their menu as it is listed as \"spinach, tomato and pesto sauce\" which leads one to wonder if it contains tomatoes and has pesto sauce or if it contains tomato pesto sauce.  I was hoping it was the former and it was, gratefully.    It comes with a side salad with house French vinaigrette dressing.  I thought the portions were excellent, the taste very good, and the price of 14.79 which included a diet coke to be fine for lunch.  I will say I loved it but, as far as wanting to return with my husband for a weekend breakfast?  I think the space is too small for a drive here specifically for this restaurant only to probably find it is very busy and there is no place inside to wait for a table.  Off-hour visits would be best."}
{"text":"Good crepes! I got Bristol!! The avocado and smoked Turkey are great combination! Will go the second time!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place got such good reviews. Food was mediocre at best; tiny pizza lace with no room for people to wait."}
{"text":"Somehow we were able to grab a table on a busy Saturday morning.  Otherwise, it's usually packed and wait time is 15-20 minutes.  We ordered the Bristol Crepe (Turkey, goat gouda cheese, avocado, bechamel and a ?side salad.) and the Amsterdam French Toast Platter (Turkish sausage, egg, and maple butter).  The sausage was a little saltier than I'd like by itself? but paired with the French toast it becomes a great sweet and salty combo."}
{"text":"Good, solid breakfast place! We had no wait for a party of three on a Monday morning. I had a savory crepe with ham & swiss and added egg for $2 but when our meals came out they had forgotten my egg. Service was super attentive and apologetic and the kitchen whipped up an omelette for me right away to add to my crepe. I'm so glad I took them up on the offer of bringing me an omelette because it was perfectly cooked and a great addition. The three of us split a banana and nutella crepe for an after breakfast treat which was also delicious.  I will say, I don't think it's cute here or even special. It's in what is essentially a basement. It is not well decorated. But all of those things are okay! Just accept Cafe Moulin for what it is- a solid and affordable breakfast joint."}
{"text":"This is a tiny spot, but it's a great brunch spot.  The French toast is good but the crepes are great."}
{"text":"I more than enjoyed my breakfast here at  Cafe Moulin . It's a lovely Breakfast & Coffee shop in Walnut, Shadyside . The Owner and the staff are very kind and friendly. Especially the server Nursu is always there with her cheerful smile to help you with your choices. I came here to have continental breakfast and ordered Sophia crepe and french toasts. Everything i ate was amazing. I really loved every single one. French toast and the fruits are very fresh and tasted so good.I also liked the combination of turkish sausage and eggs in the crepe.Beside the breakfast i also ordered café latte. I loved it  all as much as i loved the portion size! I strongly recommend this place to the people who like French based European food or just want to try something different in Pittsburgh .I'm looking forward to come back !"}
{"text":"The food is good but there is only 2 tables outside neither reserved for disabled. It sickens me how many places have stairs that don't ensure disabled people can enjoy their establishment. We drove 30 minutes to get there. My Husband has trouble with stairs. Though the food was good not coming here again is no big loss."}
{"text":"Adorable little cafe located slightly below street level. The crepes are delicious and have great flavor combinations! The amount of smoked salmon on the Alaskan was perfect! However, I could have easily eaten 3 crepes!"}
{"text":"I def miss the old place.  They pack the patrons in here like it's NYC; yet completely ill-equipped to handle big crowds.  45 min wait for a crepe?!?  Really?"}
{"text":"The staff is always working hard, as there is usually a line out the door. I make so many adjustments to the crepes I order off the menu, and they always get it right! Along with a great  cappuccino! Plus lots of shopping around to do after!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Small and intimate. Bright lighting and rustic, Victorian decor. Definitely fits french fusion scene.  Service: It's funny, how the this one rude server actually yelped this place- praising it and all. Really, girl, really? Do better on your hospitality. She even took our order late. We already knew what to get while we were waiting. Besides her- the other server was sooo freakin nice! He was attentive and hospitable during our meal. Wish I gave him the tips personally.   Food: The crepes were on point for me. I was soo hungry for breakfast and the Bristol filled me up till dinner time. Their chai tea latte was good too but a tad bit too sweet. They could notch the sweetness down just a bit. My party also enjoyed their crepes. They gave it a 5 stars!  Unfortunately, the overall rating is average. The food is a 4 but one down for the service. Would I come back tho? Of course!"}
{"text":"We loved it! It was super busy but girls were so quick and sit us in 5-10 min to the table already! Since we were in such a rush they tried to accommodate us very quick. The breakfast was to just so yammi and delicious! Their feta& spinach crepe was just like in Paris, France: so soft and barely melting in a mouth! Latte was full of taste and we enjoyed it a lot. I guess this place is new and they are still trying to attract people it. That's why the atmosphere and food is so good. Hope they will keep their reputation always is good standing! Thank you so much for the breakfast!"}
{"text":"Small, intimate, and hip brunch place with great crepes.   I was there on a Friday afternoon and there were only a few other people there. It's small but cozy and the friendly, attentive service made it a wonderful experience.   The Halle Berry crepe was good--sweet and smothered in Nutella--and will surely satisfy any sweet tooth.   I also tried their salad, which was average and nothing really special (apparently, the goat cheese is quite unique but I am unfortunately not a fan of the strong goat-y aftertaste of goat cheese). But the waiter did inform us that they are updating the menu soon to include more salads so keep an eye out after around Christmas '17!   Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Cafe Moulin and will probably return to check out their revamped menu."}
{"text":"The perfect breakfast! I wish I lived in Pittsburgh as this would easily become my new breakfast/brunch spot. The menu had so many amazing choices that I had a hard time even picking one option. The coffee was fresh, the ambience cozy, and the food: ridiculously good. Thank you!"}
{"text":"It was so-so.  I guess thing to order are crepes.  The breakfast sandwich with over-easy eggs and bacon was a mess!  Should have just deconstructed it and served eggs over easy with a side of toast and bacon.  Not a place I could see returning."}
{"text":"The crepes here are prepared well, but they are way too expensive for the amount that is served. Every time I've come here, I have had to order 3 crepes to share with 1 other person.   The problem is that they fold the crepes into a quarter pocket, into which they stuff the toppings. It would be so much better if they served the crepes folded in half with the toppings on top.   The side salad and drinks here are also fine for lunch, but the cost of having brunch here is prohibitive!"}
{"text":"Cafe Moulin is a tiny, almost hole in the wall, little French restaurant right off walnut street in Shadyside. And I am so glad I decided to give it a try. We went around 11:30 on a Saturday and were told the wait would be up to 20 minutes but I think we waited for less than ten. The food deserves 5 stars, but the service was a little lacking. The waitress was slow to come over to us, didn't bring us waters, and took a good ten minutes after we'd finished eating to bring the check by. But I would still go back. If you love crepes, this place is a must try. I had a vanilla chai tea and the Bristol savory crepe, which has turkey, goat cheese, and avocado in it and it was to die for. Then for desert we split a cheesecake crepe. I have to say, it was better than the crepe I had while visiting Paris. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had the walnut street crepe and it was probably the best crepe I have ever had. The Brie cheese was nicely melted in the inside and the granola, maple butter, and walnuts added a nice sweet crunch with every bite. It was also surprisingly filling for a crepe.   The latte was nothing special and beware there is not a lot of seating, but definitely worth it. I know I will be back."}
{"text":"Banana crape is crazy. Sooooo yummy.  Sometimes it's too sweet but with coffee, no problem! The fantastic combination of dough, banana, chocolate, and cream entertains not only my tongue but also my eyes!! The plate setting is so cute!!!  I have nothing to complain about. Waitresses on the floor and customers at tables, all of them are so nice. I love this place"}
{"text":"My go-to spot for a cozy brunch date! I love the vibes of this place -- it's kind of tucked away on a small street and you go down a few steps to get into the cafe. It's always a little busy but I usually go on weekdays so it's never been packed.  My favorite crepe is definitely the Bristol! It's a perfect blend of turkey, avocado, cheese, and creamy goodness. It feels like comfort food but it's light enough so you don't feel bad about it afterwards (which is always good). The crepes are slightly cripsy on the outside, and super soft and light when you bite into them. They also come with a small side salad!  For coffee, I either opt for the bottomless brewed or the latte, and they both hit the spot for me. Overall, the ambience, service, and food here makes this one of my favorite brunch places in Pittsburgh!  *** Also if you're a student, make sure you use the Yelp coupon to get 10% off!"}
{"text":"Meh, just not for me. The food was ok, and the coffee was ok.   I had the Alaskan Crepe omelette... Contains smoke salmon, eggs, cream cheese, shallots, and some type of caper sauce. I opted out of the caper sauce and cream cheese. It also came with a side of greens with dressing. Maybe I'll opt for the sweeter more traditional crepes if I go again...."}
{"text":"Overrated. I admit I was stoked to come here after hearing coworkers telling me to come and all the shining reviews online. It's almost an hour away but I braved the frigid temperatures and traffic to try this out. Worth it? Absolutely not.   Prices are HIGH and portions are TINY. I got the Mykonos French toast dish with 4 thin, dinky slices of \"spicy\" sausage. This was already $10 and I was not full or impressed. The French toast slices were thin and unseasoned without the syrup. The menu claimed it was butter maple syrup but those are lies. I just got a tin cup with regular cheap syrup. Hubby ordered the Bristol crepe ($10) but was afraid the portion would be too small so added eggs ($2) on top. He said the taste was good but it was way too dry. It claimed to have bechamel sauce but definitely not enough.   I commented that the only authentically Parisian element about this place were the bathrooms. The door actually brushes against the toilet seat. This is all the room you get. I'm critical because I've had delicious crepes in Paris and not only are they not very pricey, they are a silkier, buttery taste that is lost on this poor substitute in the U.S. It was dim, stuffy, crowded and run-down (or hipster style). I would not recommend this place or go back myself. Give me First Watch or IHOP any day."}
{"text":"Such a charming little breakfast spot in Shadyside! I really enjoyed my visit and would recommend Cafe Moulin to others.   Atmosphere: It's tiny, intimate, quaint. It has very cozy feel to it... I almost felt like I was dining in someone's home. They have an open kitchen which was cool but potentially bothersome due to the heat being produced in such a tiny space. The back of the restaurant was HOT. The tiny air conditioning unit in the front of the restaurant didn't suffice. Also, the are very close together. Didn't necessarily bother me but just be aware that it's probably not a good spot if you're with a large group.   Menu: Pretty extensive list of sweet/savory crepes, a build your own crepe option, and other breakfast staples including French toast, waffles, eggs, sausage, etc. Decent prices... crepes seemed to range from $6-10.   Food: I tried the banelle crepe (banana, Nutella, chocolate sauce, and whipped cream on the side). Presentation was really nice... definitely picture worthy. It was very good. Very sweet and light. I would highly recommend to others!  Service: Good. We were immediately greeted by a very friendly employee. There was a 20-30 minute wait but the guy was really friendly and kept us updated throughout the wait. Our server was nice as well."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and both times have had pleasant experiences with the waitstaff and ambiance.  Both times, I've only gotten sweet crepes for breakfast here.  They were quite tasty, with good presentation. However, I was kind of disappointed in the size of the serving for the price. I guess I look at crepes to France as tacos are to Mexico - inexpensive street food.   I'll have to try some savory crepes - they look a bit bigger and more filling. The vegetarian selection isn't the greatest, though."}
{"text":"Like everyone else has been saying cafe moulin is amazing! I got seated right away and the service was fast and everyone was so nice. I ordered the PB&J crepe and it was everything I hoped it would be. Nothing here disappointed, and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for the longest time. I've tried so many breakfast places in Pittsburgh, that I am kind of disappointed in this place when I finally did try it. Don't get me wrong, everything tasted great, but just not outstanding I guess. I wish their food selection is larger. It is mostly crepes, so if you are a big fan of crepes, this is definitely your place. I love the sweet crepes I got, but the savory crepes was average."}
{"text":"Was craving a good crepe so we decided to go to Cafe Moulin.  Super Belgium Crepe (2/5): good if you like a lot of cookie butter, but I found it to have way too much cookie butter in it which made it difficult to finish.  Banella Crepe (3/5): better than the Super Belgium, but still had way too much nutella spread on it.  Alaskan Crepe (3.5/5): very filling and decent smoked salmon crepe, but a little on the heavy side.  Overall I found the crepes to be average and a little pricey."}
{"text":"Have been here twice in 2 weeks.  The french toast is amazing, each slice is about 2\" thick and their use of cheeses pairs perfectly with the sweet taste of the fruits and the maple butter.  Their crepes are also delicious.  The only drawback is the menu is somewhat small but this is overpowered by everything tasting so delicious."}
{"text":"Nice crepes place. I had the crepe with chicken, onion, and a slightly spicy sauce; the dessert crepe was the 'Halle Berry' with chocolate and fresh strawberries. Quite filling, and also tasty."}
{"text":"Well I was excited about visiting this café, considering how cute and tucked away it is. After walking down into the cafe, I wasn't greeted by anyone. That's fine sometimes during busy times anywhere someone can be overlooked.   I proceeded to walk around as it's rather small, just to see if I could set up my computer. I'm a freelance contract worker so it's usually pretty important to me that I be able to work and enjoy the restaurant. I'd already saw that there was Xfinity wifi available, so the only other thing I needed was an outlet. Since no one still had greeted or tried to engage me to help, I looked around. I made contact with a younger woman with an apron on, signaling to me she worked there, but after she didn't speak or rely to my southern head nod, I moved on. After finding an outlet I turned around to find help and understand seating. I saw someone set a table so I knew there had to be a host somewhere. Before I could, that same young woman who passed on saying hello or trying to help earlier, decide to speak after all. She asked where I was going, and I explained to her that I was just checking on available outlets and wifi to see if this would be a place where I could work and eat. Instead of helping she made the snarky comment that I couldn't sit there, although I wasn't sitting anywhere, and that there's a host and I needed to find him and wait for him to find me a seat.   I decided then that this wasn't the type of environment for me, so I let her know that she didn't answer my question or concerns about outlets and wifi and based off her unwelcoming demeanor and disregard to talk with me, I'd just find somewhere else. And I did right down the street. I was disappointed because it was such a charming place with a seemingly awesome menu, but I still believe quality customer service is important. All I could do was hope that race had nothing to do with how cold and rude she was.   Maybe another time it'll work it, I'll ask a friend to let me know."}
{"text":"Cute shop in Lawrenceville. My fiancee and I were looking for a tasty quick brunch before we went off to the grocery store (never shop on an empty stomach!)... and Yelp shows us the way! It is a small cafe on the first floor of the building but offers plenty of seating! We didn't have to wait since we were okay with sitting at the bar next to the kitchen. It was fun watching (read: learning) how they make their crepes and french toast! We ordered a vanilla latte and a cappuccino which arrived hot and delicious! We sipped on these as we waited for our food, which wasn't long. I ordered the French Toast with strawberries and a side of two eggs and my fiancee the Spinach Tomato Mozzarella crepe (you know, for the sweet and salty approach we always take!). Both were perfect! My fiancee almost forgot we were splitting and finished 90% of the crepe... so thankfully I still tried it. Fluffy, delicious, flavorful! The french toast bread was amazing and the coating was cooked perfectly! Yum! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went to this place before an academic meeting and I'm so glad I did. The Ottawa crepe was amazing and the complimentary turkey/chicken/greatness sausage was amazing. The coffee? Bruh! I do NOT drink coffee and this coffee was amazeballs! I drank it black and it was great. 15% off for students by itself is a reason to go. Great service, great food. I will be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town for French toast. The menu is perfect for brunch but the basement environment is really only a plus for those with a bad hangover."}
{"text":"first, this place would have been three stars if not for the fact that it replaced crepes parisiennes...  first, ambiance, if you don't care skip it. the renovations and location look good but now it's a completely sit down restaurant yyet still with a paper menu that you would expect of a suburban pizza joint. the place reeks of middle brown pretentions with little to back up it's nature. french people can be rude i am told but at least they make good food. further, mixed in are some of the alternative commercialized hipster movements such as a focus on italian coffees and water served not in a glass but rather a jar with a straw. this place is seeking a younger but classy ambiance and in my opinion falls flat for trying too hard. also the music was fairly lame, crepes parisiennes went the whole hog and played very french music, cafe moulin plays slow alt pop...  still, good coffee and in a ceramic cup. so plus twenty points.  as to the food, it seemed fitting that i would order my typical order at crepes parisiennes. i can't speak to moulin's sweet crepe, but their attempt of a tomato and cheese crepe was sub par. a tasteless crepe with cherry tomatoes and an overabundance of cheese to cover the lack of anything else. the cherry tomatoes make the mix less juicy as they retain much less water in cooking, further the cheese here was fattier leading it to remain rubbery at serving temperature. at one point i realized i was simply chewing a large chunk of cheese.  did i have fun acting like a snoody critic right now? yes, so this was a bit meaner than my typical fare, but still i won't be back unless i just want something sweet and a cup of coffee, then maybe..."}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday morning around 10 am or so, and it was empty.  Service was good and friendly.  The food was great.  I am not someone who has eaten crepes much, and I found that these were excellent.  I got the Super Belgium - which had belgian cookie spread, bananas, strawberries and chocolate sauce, with a little whipped cream on the side.  The cookie spread tasted similar to a peanut butter, but much better, richer, and more luxurious.  The flavors all together were wonderful - and complimented each other perfectly.  The whipped cream was also dense with a deep, rich flavor.  This place is a great breakfast option in Shadyside."}
{"text":"This is a quiet little spot in shadyside that can be easily missed if you walk too fast. But if I were I'd slow down and go inside! The crepes were flavorful, good variety and filling. Their coffee is so rich and fresh. I had the spinach and feta crepe with cafe latte, it was perfect brunch! My friends also ordered Halle berry to share and one bite was enough to take you back to childhood. It had Nutella, strawberries and the warm crepe melted the chocolate. This place is a go to in pgh, especially if you're visiting."}
{"text":"It can be a longer wait when it gets crowded, but everyone is friendly and the food is awesome! The super Belgium is really good."}
{"text":"Was here for breakfast and lunch at two different times. Very small place packed with people most of the times. Especially during a weekend, it is reasonable to expect a wait time of 10-15 minutes.   I ordered spinach and feta with eggs the first time. It is good. Their crepes are thick and well cooked. They serve it with a salad and it is usually fresh. My friends ordered the Alaskan and chicken (Marseille) crepes both of which they thought are tastier than the spinach and feta. So, if you are not a vegetarian, you might want to consider ordering those over the vegetarian options.   The second time, I started with a cup of Cappuccino and I am pleasantly surprised by the creaminess. This time I ordered the Tivoli which is served with tomatoe pesto, spinach and mozarella. By the way, tomatoe pesto is also used in alaskan crepe and it is delicious.   I will go back again and try the Alaskan or Marseille crepes next time. Very good place for both vegetarian and meat eaters when it comes to savory crepes."}
