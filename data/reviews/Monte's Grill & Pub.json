{"text":"Eaten here many times when in Verona for Epic training, staying at the Holiday Inn Express (see review there--great place). Monte's is a bar-grill type place. Staff is friendly and the food is good. Fried cheese curds are great. I've had most of the burgers, the fish special, stuffed grilled cheese.. it's all pretty good. The best thing about the place is the great selection of local beer, bottled and tap. make it a point to try something different each trip!"}
{"text":"Barely decent bar food. Chili had no flavor, just meat in tomato broth with a few beans. Taco salad was just lettuce in a greasy shell with bland and stringy hamburger on top and a few tomato fragments. Hamburger was cold. Yech."}
{"text":"Fish fry Friday night. Busy and took over an hour to get food. The staff was great and I felt bad because she was consistently delivering bad news (which she had no control over). They were out of co2 so they ran out of a lot of the beers. They ran out of potatoes. Food was good. Had the walleye and it was good. It was first time trying walleye. My friends said it was fine but they've had much better. Cheese curds were amazing. If I lived in town I'd give it another shot but since we are visiting a few days I'll try some other places instead."}
{"text":"It's your typical hometown bar in hometown Verona (with a few twists - more about it in a minute). The interior decor is aging (from the 80's), the sound system is uninspiring, and there's a sense of decrepit all around.   What are those twists and why a 4 star rating? Well, twist 1 - the staff is incredibly nice and really cares about you having a good time (hope that does not change under new management). Twist 2 - the food, even though it is your standard American bar fare, is a cut above average. I cannot put my finger on what it is but chilli is slightly a cut above the ordinary, the onion rings are a cut above the ordinary and so on and so forth. Twist 3 - fairly good selection of local beers on tap. Twist 4 - super awesome Tuesday night trivia.   Seems like they are also getting into live music later this summer. So if you are in Verona, WI, give this friendly neighborhood bar a chance one of the nights instead of heading out to downtown Madison every single time."}
{"text":"Nice place. Clean. Draft beer was a little on the warm side. I had the mushroom and Swiss burger with fries. Overall good, but it was overcooked. Not too done or dry, just not cooked they way I specified."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. It is clearly a bar that serves food as opposed to a restaurant that serves drinks. The game is always on the tv and the bartenders and waiters are great and very friendly. The people watching is good too, as it is with most bars.  I've had the fish both times I've been here and it was great both times. And the old fashion was fantastic. A very nice surprise."}
{"text":"Love this place. The owner is very friendly and likes to get to know his regular customers. The food is good and the atmosphere is too. Great brunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for dinner, but haven't been 100% happy ever. Wraps are decent, fish fry is just fine. I prefer just to stop in for a drink and/or appetizers only. Recommend the cheese curds or the chicken wings. Waitstaff is okay, but the bartenders are pretty great."}
{"text":"Stopped with a client for lunch and ordered the cod special. Fish was very bland and flavorless. French fries were mushy. Cheese cake for dessert tasted old as if it had either been frozen too long or in the box too long. The only thing good was the coffee. Eating area was clean and the service was good, but the food was obviously very low quality. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"One of the worst recent dining experiences I have had. My partner got his food 20+ min after everyone else. The spacey waiter didn't even notice so we had to track staff down at the bar. Bartender said our waiter was \"back there,\" gesturing towards the kitchen. Not helpful. After waiting outside the kitchen door's window, I did find him with others eating eating their own dinners (probably my partner's!). He was very chill and just said we'd get it for free....right. I saw this in multiple other reviews. Comping isn't the solution; providing legitimate service is.  In experiences here, the food has been dry to the point of injuring my mouth (sandwiches). Also very bland and one time rank (salad, I think the black beans). Beer selection is decent, however taps are sweet, which typically indicates unclean tap lines.  They do have trivia. I love trivia and the host."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, awesome cheese curds (and plenty of them!), delicious ranch dressing, perfect waffle fries and really good French fries! Restrooms were clean. The barstools were a little uncomfortable and they only had one low table big enough for a family of 5. We had to sit at a high table which was a little uncomfortable and awkward with little ones. The booster seats were disgustingly dirty and gross to the touch, but overall, I was pleasantly surprised with this place for lunch. I'd go back for the curds and ranch, for sure!"}
{"text":"First time we visited = 4.5 stars. The food was delicious, service was excellent, great beer list. The place was almost empty so I suspect that's why we got so much attention. It was a Thursday night.  Second time we visited = 2 stars. It was a Friday night, so they were much busier. My husband, two small children, and I were seated in a small dining area off the main bar. When we asked for a beer list, the server directed us to the chalkboard on the wall near the bar, which was not visible from our seat. I had to get up from the table with my 5 month old and walk over to see the beer list. Strike one. It took ages for our server to bring out our drinks, which she attributed to having to change the keg (it had been at least 20 minutes). Then it took her another 10 minutes to come back and take our order, so by the time we actually got our food we had been there 45 minutes. With a 3 year old and a 5 month old. Strike two. My husband ordered the beef dip sandwich that he had loved last time we came. This time he said it was ok but not as good. I ordered the stuffed grilled cheese, which was supposed to come with avocado, bacon, onion, and tomato. There was hardly any cheese, and I have never had such an underripe, rubbery avocado in my life. It was nearly inedible and I took most of it off. Very disappointing. Strike three.   We had been looking forward to a new family place to meet after my husband gets off work on Friday nights (he works at Epic), but sadly we won't be coming back to Monte's."}
{"text":"Picture 3 Austinites arriving at the Fairfield Inn at night with thin blood and all suffering from cedar fever allergies and starving. Since none of us wanted to spend much time out in the cold (yea I know u TX wussies) the front desk pointed us across the street to Monte's. Of course we drove!!   Being a veteran of Madison I insisted we order the cheese curd appetizer and it did not disappoint. Our entrees included burgers and the lake perch. The portions were bountiful, the beer was cold and the service excellent. This is a great pub/sports bar and I would definitely return. Love finding these places while on the road!"}
{"text":"Solid, no nonsense breakfast at a great price. Nothing particularly remarkable about the food--it's what you'd expect from any breakfast diner, but it is done well, tastes great, and has hearty portion sizes. Best thing, it's Denny's-level-priced but actually tastes like real food."}
{"text":"Warm and friendly bar and grill walking distance from the Holliday In Express in Verona. I went there 3 times recently and really enjoyed this place. I agree with Hien D's review about beer selection and chill factor. I had their Onion Rings, Sliders, Waffle Fries, Bully Boy Wrap and one night Emily suggested the Ruben - which was amazing! A friend ordered the cheese curds which were really great. On all 3 visits we were served fast and friendly! So if you want to escape the hotel (or are in the neighborhood) I recommend this place to chill out, have a few beers and a Ruben and enjoy life away from the snow."}
{"text":"While this spot was convenient, I was Staying at the nearby Hotel(across the street), It wasn't doing it for me. The bar is not stocked with much. Not many beers to choose from. I was trying to watch the NBA Finals and couldn't fully let the expletives fly because there were children hanging out in the joint!!!(It was after 9p..its a pub!)  I was there because the hotel gave out some free drink vouchers and I wasn't gonna pass that up. But that would be the only reason Id go there again."}
{"text":"Standard American bar fare. I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with fries, which was fine. The highlight here is the great selection of local craft beers on tap. If you're staying at the Holiday Inn Express in Verona for Epic, get a free drink coupon and walk across the street if you're relying on shuttle service. It's non-smoking, too, which was welcome for a bar."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, nice atmosphere, very clean. Onion rings were awesome and came with a garlic dip...yum! Hubby had the stuffed grilled cheese and loved it. Couldn't eat all of it. I had the quesadilla salad and it was good, but I think it needed a bit more veggies on it. It was also conveniently located right across from our hotel."}
{"text":"Great place. The prices are very reasonable, the T-Bone steak special was awesome, the fries were fresh and very good. The beer was good and the salad was pretty fresh. I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Food was ok... I had a wrap.  The cheese curds were decent and tasty.  It was the only place open later near our hotel after arriving on a late flight."}
{"text":"How have I not written a review about Monte's yet??!! It's like Cheers!  Everybody knows your name.  I had to make several trips to Wisconsin for work in the last couple of months.  My hotel was right across the street from Monte's.  I've got nothing bad to say about this place.  First, Monte and his wife Roxy are regulars at their own place.  It's fabulous!! They're so friendly!  Scotty Do and Tyler are superb.  They remember what your drink of choice is every time you come back.  I was up there during the NBA finals, and on the same night, it was the Dancing with the Stars season finale.  They spoiled me and put the Miami game on one tv, and Dancing with the Stars on another!  Tuesday night is trivia night.  The locals get very into it.  So much fun.  My team, Team WHATEVA, brought the house down on our first appearance at trivia.  The food is pretty darn good too.  Never been to the fish fry, but I hear it's amazing.  So if you're ever in Verona, Wisconsin and are lookin' for a good time, stop in at Monte's and you definitely won't regret it.  Play Livin' on a Prayer on the juke box and tell 'em Laura from Miami sent ya ;)"}
{"text":"Found this place after a day at the New Glarus Brewery.  It was across the street from our hotel.  We were pleasantly surprised!  The food was very good!  Nice, relaxed atmosphere.  Everyone was having a good time as it was karaoke night!"}
{"text":"Our family hasn't had a meal so disappointing in a long time.  We were in the mood for fish fry, and checked online for a location.  At Monte's the confusion started with the order:  The special was a Mahi Mahi with pineapple salsa, and came with Mediterranean veggies.  However, looking for the classic fish fry, my husband and I both ordered the highlighted perch fish fry.  (Although I asked the waitress if it was highlighted because it was a signature dish, and she said she didn't know it was highlighted.  Another point of annoyance: every fish dish on the menu was \"Market Price\".  Like the market for the Cisco truck fluctuates from day to day.)  I also asked to substitute the Mediterranean veggies for the coleslaw, and the waitress said that was fine.  When our food arrived, it was a pile of curling fried slivers.  Not a single piece of fish was more than about an inch wide and 3-4 inches wide.  My mashed potatoes were dry, and instead of the Med veggies, I got a large florette of steamed broccoli.  Now, I like broccoli in general, but it didn't have salt, butter, or any sauce - just bland, pre-frozen broccoli.  When I questioned why it wasn't the Med veggies, the waitress told me you can only get those with the special.  I barely ate any of it, yet it appeared as an additional $2 charge our on bill.  So much for substitutions!  Had a noticed it before we left, I would have argued, but instead I'll post a review on Yelp. :)  There is no printed kid's menu, but the waitress did say they had some unofficial kids meals.  Our kids got mini burgers and fries.  The fries were OK, but the burger was on some horrible bun that smushed down to an eighth of an inch think when you picked it up.  They ate their fries, but not the burgers, and usually they are good eaters!  All in all, our bill came to nearly $50 with tip.  The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because the staff was really friendly.  We will never return again - I've had better fish at Culvers for less than 1/2 the price!"}
{"text":"Great pub food with craft beer on tap, reasonable prices. Very friendly staff. Convenient location across the street from the Holiday Inn. I had the trio of sliders that were amazing, and they have beer and wine to go which is great if you're stuck at a hotel without transportation!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for a drink. Best cheese curds! Monte and Roxanne are fantastic and usually there at the bar."}
{"text":"Good beer, mellow bar, and across the street from the Holiday Inn. Kim was my waitress and she was super cool! I didn't try the food,  but it's definitely a chill place to throw back a few drinks, watch sports, and hangout with your buddies. A must visit if you're staying at the Holiday Inn! Ask for Kim if you go!"}
{"text":"I ate here twice on my trip to Verona. The first time I called ahead and ordered the stuffed grilled cheese (hold the onions) with a side of fries. Didn't take long at all to prepare and it tasted pretty good, especially with ketchup! The second time I ate in the restaurant with friends and ordered chicken tenders with sweet potato fries. It took longer than I thought necessary for fried food, but it was also somewhat busy. Unfortunately the sweet potato fries weren't all that warm by the time the food was delivered. I ended up taking most of it home and heating it up in my hotel room. I ate the chicken tenders with BBQ sauce and ranch dressing. They charge for the second sauce, first one comes with the meal. It was walking distance from the hotel where I stayed, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Went there for a Badger game and had an awesome time! The service was fantastic, very friendly and attentive staff. Plenty of TVs and seating. Had the California Chicken sandwich without the bun and sweet potato fries (they were waffle - BONUS!!). Good portion sizes. Free shots for touchdowns are always appreciated!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place. I had their cheeseburger with the cheese curds (which was surprisingly good).   Both times I ordered the food to go and the service was quick. Seems like a really good place to go in Verona (if you're in the area).   Side note: its a non-smoking establishment, so that's an extra plus."}
{"text":"Super genuinely friendly staff. Plenty of flat screens to catch multiple games at once. Cold Stella on tap. Average pub grub."}
{"text":"Great food, warm atmosphere . I was a little scared as a single woman walking in due to a row of guys at the bar and slightly broken dive bar decor, but the amazing bartender immediately put me at ease. He greeted me warmly as I hesitated at the door. I had the best cheese curds I have ever had, and the salad was full of crisp fresh veggies. I think the bartender is the heart of Monte's. Don't hesitate to try it out, great for business travelers and locals."}
{"text":"After a couple years of driving right on by (shame on me!) I've finally visited Monte's at least five times. The first visit was a pleasant surprise in every way; the exterior is plain and easy to pass on by. I assumed this would be a regular old bar/greasy burger joint. While it is pretty much a bar and burger joint, the menu exceeded all my expectations.  Service has been great every time I've been here. I will add a caveat to that... I've never been during a game or other typically busy bar times. We tend to go out to eat during non-peak times and there have always only been a few other guests at the bar or maybe another table or two while we were there. The waitresses have been quick to move on to their other tasks, which is fine by  me, and will sometimes jump in for each other to run a dish or drink to the table. I appreciate great teamwork!  The food is where you'll be surprised, and that's what really matters, right? If you like fried curds, theirs are great. Yes, they're a little greasy but definitely up there for texture/flavor. So far, my favorite meal was an amazing Chicken Philly with caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, sweet onion jack dressing and a cilantro lime cream drizzle. Oh.. my... goodness, this was delicious - and HUGE. I took more than half home and had two small meals out of the leftovers. My companion had a buffalo chicken mac and cheese, which included broccoli in a superbly classic homemade Wisconsin cheddar cheese sauce with blue cheese crumbles. The sauce was extremely rich and this meal also made for decent leftovers. I'll admit that on my first visit I tried one of my \"safe menu tester\" items, a chicken-bacon-ranch wrap, and was nonplussed. However, everything else has been great.  Will I be back? Oh, yes. Prices are fair, portions are huge, staff are friendly. Monte's is close enough to home to become a regular lunch spot, so we'll definitely return and bring friends."}
{"text":"Really great! I recommend sitting directly at the bar for the best service. .  Standard pub and bar food but they have had some zingers in there. I had a flat iron steak special that was amazingly seasoned. Veggies and baked potato were basic though.   Waffle fries, amazing. Good burgers and local ingredients.  Local beer selections, also good but limited. They make sure that they give the staff knowledge on what is served (there is a binder of the local beers for them to reference).   Most of the servers/bartenders are talkative and friendly. Trivia was fun but maybe look into a better sound system...tough to hear the answers at time...   Just going back to my prior recommendation...this is not a huge sit down and be waited upon place. So be prepared that the servers are also bartenders, and they are doing a great job for the size of the place. Go if you're laid back, if you're more formal or looking for something more, this may not be for you."}
{"text":"My friend and I are out-of-towners, visiting for Easter, chose this place because it was across the street from our hotel...and because it was open. Fantastic find!! Place has a bit of a dive bar-esque feel, but the service and food are great. Our bartender, Dolton (I think I got that name right.) was friendly, and informative. Its was late night so it was really slow but, the employees were on-their-game still, and seemed genuinely glad to have us. A much more far-reaching menu then I expected but, I was also glad to see they had the more standard bar fair. Overall, I probably wouldn't chose this place for a first date, or a business dinner; however, if you want good food & good conversation with a great bartender or just wanna chill alone with a burger and beer--you won't do better then this place. If/when I am back in town, I will definitely make this my go to spot."}
{"text":"this was a nice little place.  A bar with good food.   I was looking more for a restaurant, but for the price it was great.  service was quick abd the food was very good.  Well worth the stop"}
{"text":"Come here is you want good old style pub atmosphere with friendly service and a hearty meal.  We were staying in Verona for work and we didn't want to drive out to Madison for a meal so we literally walked across the road to monte's. There hotel staff had good words about the place and you also get a free drink if you're staying at the hotel so that's a bonus.  Entered, and from behind the bar the bartender friendly waved us in and said to sit anywhere. The vibe of the place feels like your local pub with people from all over the area sitting together around the bar chatting, and Monte was in the house also. It felt like the staff and locals were a big family but you didn't feel like you were intruding coming in from the hotel as they were very friendly and they obviously get a lot of business from across the road.  They have heaps of local beers on the menu and a good local cider too for me. Although there weren't too manay gluten free options (and unfortunately they were out of chilli too) I had ended up going with the pork chop after 2 prior attempts at ordering. They were very accommodating and I didn't feel like I was being a hassle or pressured to order quickly at all when I had to find another option. It ended up being a great meal the pork chop was a good one, one of the better ones I've had since moving to the States, grilled well and nice and plump...and I upgraded to the spicy waffle fries on the side. Although not particularly spicy they were still tasty and were great with some hot sauce (something that I love about American restaurants - they all have hot sauce!!).  My friend ordered the Tony's taco special of the day (Tony did a great job!) and he enjoyed his meal also (which was pretty big, came with 3 tacos, rice and beans.  3 hours and 5 pints of cider/beer later, we tumbled out of there a little tipsy and satisfied with a good relaxed meal, very good service and a nice and easy short stroll back to our rooms."}
{"text":"A staple for Verona residents.  Good consistent bar food with cold beer.  Excellent specials daily - you are very lucky if they have the salad bar open.  I love a true Wisconsin salad bar - fresh bacon, cottage cheese, hard boiled eggs, homemake croutons, peas, beans, blue cheese dressing, and so much more.  My husband adores the hot wings - slightly crunchy, meaty and plenty of sauce.   They have an enormous hamburger - I saw someone eat it . . . to much for me, but that guy looked very happy, his wife on the other hand - disgusted.  The owner is their frequently, very personable and good with his staff and customers."}
