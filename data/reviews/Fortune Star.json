{"text":"I've been here many times with large parties and also by myself. There's a great variety of tasty food, and I especially enjoy their Chinese section. The staff is attentive and clear away dishes and fill drinks quickly. The prices are reasonable for what you get. Also, the interior is very pretty, and the bathrooms are clean. I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"I must be stupid to not follow my own advice. After an initial poor experience in May, I have been back twice with continued disappointment. The only thing I can rationalize as to why is the convenience of a buffet. But, it is three strikes and your out and I won't be back. Food remains bland, tastes similar regardless of what the dish is called, and is lukewarm."}
{"text":"Found 3 different hairs- one in the ranch dressing, one in the salad cheese, and one in the fried rice."}
{"text":"Typical chinese buffet, which is one of my favorite style restaurants. Problem here was they did not replenish items very quickly when they ran out, their chinese chicken variety was lacking, and the white rice had some crunchy balls of rice that were...unappetizing."}
{"text":"So disappointed to the point I  had to post how much I hated this place. The food was tasteless and there was a sugar packet in my water. The rice was so dry and sticky yuck. Even the usual easy Chinese tradition stuff sucked.  The only good thing about this place is that I sat in a booth"}
{"text":"After reading mixed reviews, I decided to check it out for myself. The buffet has a wide variety of food.  Food was a little salty,  but overall, I wasn't disappointed. The buffet & tables were also clean which I can't often say for Chinese restaurants lately."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday on a busy Saturday and the food was hot and tasted well like what you would expect from a buffet.  Overall a good selection of food and nothing to complain about.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"I am sooo skeptical about Chinese places especially buffets! And this place is amazing ! Clean and fresh! The place has a great variety of foods for all palates. Kids items as well & they are constantly changing the food items so that food isn't getting dried out. Sushi bar as well. Highly recommend it. Recommend the lunch buffet for the price over dinner pricing though !"}
{"text":"Your typical Chinese buffet, but it's huge and they have sushi and a grill.  Nice atmosphere, it's always clean when I have visited. The service although not the warmest, is hard working."}
{"text":"Here's the deal. This is a Chinese buffet. You need to go when it is busy or, naturally, it will not be as good. That being said, this is one of the best chinese buffets I have ever been to. There is a lot of variety. Hibachi, sushi, average Chinese stuff, salad bar, dumplings, dessert stuff, deep fried section. The interior of the restaurant is very clean and looks cool.   I don't really understand the negative reviews... They prob couldn't name a better buffet if they tried.  Overall, this is a Chinese buffet that costs $8(for lunch) that has good variety. PERIOD"}
{"text":"I decided to be adventurous, and went to this place at duh duh dunn! 5o'clock! I have to say, that with the very first bite, I was in heaven! I started out with a plate from the sushi bar. Granted, they only have about ten different varieties to choose from, but the flavors were spot on. One of the more notable ones was the salmon, tuna, cream cheese and avocado roll. Delicious!! There was a tempura shrimp roll that was to die for! Probably my favorite things about the bar was that they had bottles of eel sauce and sriracha mayonnaise out for the customers. I really can't get enough of that stuff! Once I inhaled that first plate, I thought I should give the rest of the place a chance to wow me. There are ten different stations including a hibachi. There were a lot of things I wasn't able to sample, but everything I tried, I had a momentary love affair with, so much so  that I ended up having four plates. Some of the most memorable things I had were the scallop salad in a clam shell, coconut shrimp. The tempura dipped fantail shrimp, still makes my mouth water! The bok choy, and the cheesy seafood salad, melted in my mouth.   All in all, it was a great experience, the wait staff was so attentive in the sharp uniforms, the bathroom was nice and clean. The restaurants atmosphere was the most beautiful I had ever seen in a buffet or any restaurant, the cork carvings in between the booths were a lovely detail. I definitely will be going back many more times."}
{"text":"Good was subpar. Had a wide variety of food options; however, none of the food was actually good."}
{"text":"So my best friend and I went there for dinner and  what not but then later on, when our server brought out our receipts I only was making sure my payment was correct she all of the sudden slammed/ snatched the receipt/pen out of my hand definitely WILL NOT be going there EVER AGAIN!!!! (This happened on April 12th, 2018 by the way)  P.S. How can I report to their corporate office because when I've called they've said that they don't have a corporate office. (Please help)"}
{"text":"If you go alone or with two people, then I absolutely would not recommend Fortune Star. They will only seat you at a tiny table along the wall of the buffet where you will constantly get bumped into by other patrons, have your table bumped, and my favorite, get random food dropped on your table. THUMBS DOWN FORTUNE STAR!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time for take out and I was really disappointed.  The food was not very good and not very warm.  I arrived around 5:30 pm and nothing looked fresh.  Most dishes were drying out under the lights.  The white rice was more like mush and the food that looked appetizing did not taste very good.  I tried numerous things.  Chicken and Broccoli, some sort of spicy chicken, baked chicken, some sort of white fish that tasted fake.  The decor is very nice and the service was okay which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"The food here is comically bad. Absolutely terrible, borderline inedible. I wouldn't eat here again if it was free.   I've eaten some sketchy Chinese food in my life, but this takes the cake. Nothing has any flavor.  What I could taste, was eerily similar to wet cat food. There's a pet store next door, it's a distinct possibility. I literally didnt / couldn't eat more than one bite of anything.  The only time I was checked up on was when the check was dropped off. She asked if everything was ok. I replied \"no\". She giggled and walked away. Eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here. The establishment is nice and clean with very professional staff. I feel like no matter what I have eaten off this buffet it was of decent quality. I really like that they have eel sauce on the sushi bar! I'm always satisfied and a little over filled when I leave here. I can't even count the number of times I've been here and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"It is great for $8 lunch! Two of us ate with water to drink and our bill was $16.  We were stuffed and the food was good... You just have to remember when you go here you're getting an eight dollar meal not a $30 steak dinner and I would say it is a very good price for what you get.  Yes it is not 100% the best thing I ever ate but it gets five stars because I don't expect to spend eight dollars for the best thing I ever ate."}
{"text":"Okay for the naysayers - this is what it is - a buffet at a reasonable price.  Come during busy times as food turns over and you get something fresh off the stove.  Come at closing time not so much.  It is clean and modern with excellent service.  You will find something you like and I will be back."}
{"text":"A whole lot of variety,very reasonable price but the food is dry and stale! Avoid this place"}
{"text":"Thought I'd share a story since I thought it was pretty funny. I guess to lure in people they put a sign on their door saying \"today's special: lobster\" well my boyfriend and I were making our way to Mad Mex which is a couple stores down in the plaza, but that sign drew us inside and we ate here instead! It's a nice place inside, nice for a buffet I mean. We get seated and go to the food bar, look at where the \"lobster\" is, and we both laugh. It truthfully was every part of the lobster, EXCEPT for the tail haha! We saw the sign on the door and assumed they were serving lobster tails. We should have expected less since it is a buffet. Although we did think hm maybe this is just picked through so we waited until they refreshed the food pan and brought more out, nope, they brought more of the lobster scraps out lol. It was a good laugh, we did still eat here though. Their sushi is amazing and they have a huge bottle of eel sauce to eat with the sushi. If you've never had eel sauce before - you're missing out. My boyfriend enjoyed all the food he got as well. Overall good experience"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner today staff is nice food is awesome deff my fav restaurant had the coconut shrimp crab Rangoon & this mushroom stuff with chicken shrimp & some type of sauce (I forget the name of it lol) this place will always be my fav highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Tasteless freezer-burnt garbage is the order of the day at this place. If you have an ounce of self-respect avoid this over-priced dumpster."}
{"text":"Tried this again today and it was better than the first time!  The selection is really good and the food was hot and very tasty.  After today's visit aim changing my rating to 5 stars!  We had the same server, Candy, again today.  She is very attentive and very sweet.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I can't give this buffet more than 3 stars. If you like Asian buffets then it is possible to like this one. The restaurant is clean and always quick to seat you and serve drinks, that I have experienced. However, as the buffet itself is plenty and hot, offering Asian and non-Asian food choices, the food itself lacks any kind of flavor, and subpar at best. The food turnover seems to be steady. They have someone plenishing the buffet often.  The Sushi is okay at best and I have only had the Hibachi once, didn't find it worth a second visit. I didn't care of the Won Ton Soup. Family and friends have enjoyed the dining experience but have not come away saying anything great. It's quick ready fast food for substance. The price is very reasonable which makes it worth the visit for some."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch.  Compared to other chinese buffets in Pittsburgh, this restaurant by far is the best.  Great value, good food, clean atmosphere and the waitstaff is very attentive.  The food was tasty and a such a large selection including sushi and hibachi.  I will be back when I work in this area."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the tables were clean (which is important to me).  They offer a variety of food (other than strictly Chinese) however most of the the Chinese food did taste better  For the price we got our money's worth but if you are going here remember it's a buffet. The food sits which can become tough to eat. Salad bar is limited but the food bar is extensive including everything from ribs to steak, pizza, fish, (lots of fish) chicken, soups, sushi, hibachi, along with a small dessert table.  I'll probably stop again for lunch rather than a late dinner."}
{"text":"Great selection! I had dumplings, various types of chicken, a nice amount of sushi, and plenty of other Chinese inspired dishes! The best was the Shao Mai, so good! French Fries had an elegant texture, while maintaining the delicious crispness that comes with the deep frying! The General Tso's chicken had a sweet sauce, that complimented the savoriness of the seasoned chicken very well. Overall when eaten with chopsticks, was a very tasty bite! Bathrooms were clean, but I did feel like the staff was watching me often as they liked to hang out next to my table. Personal space please as I eat my chicken! A huge selection for under $10 is a win for me!"}
{"text":"One thing that surprised me about the Pittsburgh area was how few chinese buffets there were compared to Buffalo.  I was spoiled with high quality food with a large variety and fresh ingredients.    When the sign went up for Fortune Star I thought it was worth a visit.  I've been back two additional times.    The quality seems to be hit or miss.  The first time I went, everything was fresh and replenished.  The second time, it seemed most items were empty or dried out and the staff seemed peeved when asked about when/if they would be replenished.  Both visits were week days around 6:00.    It should be noted that the weeknight price is different from the weekend (Friday and Saturday) and the only real difference I noticed was crab legs.    Since there are not a lot of other buffet options, I will probably be back, but I won't be a regular."}
{"text":"Very sad that this place has gone downhill. The food quality is awful it looks like it's been sitting there for hours. No taste very bland. The Sushi & Hibachi cooks are on their cell phones, while the prep areas are filthy. The Sushi is old and dry, gross!!!!! The rest of the staff are on cell phones too. I even found a hair in my rice.......I Will Never will go back"}
{"text":"I can't give this place 5 stars because it's not the best Chinese place you'll ever go to. But you get a good deal for what you pay for (Friday and Saturday it is more though). They have a nice selection and most of the time the food is full. I have never gotten sick eating here.  The staff is friendly although they do not speak very much English.   This place gives buffets a good name"}
{"text":"We came in here on a Sunday afternoon. Even though I read some not so great reviews, we decided to give it a try. They had a small selection of sushi. The hibachi grill was good, even though I wish they had a wider variety of spices/sauces.  The buffet was large, and with the usual offerings.  It's a decent place."}
{"text":"Location: Miracle Mile Shopping Center Monroeville. Traffic in Monroeville is very time sensitive but the social engineers should be admired from the downtown area as dense traffic moves quickly.... until you head to Murrysville. Nontheless, it should be easy in/ easy out most times of the day via I-376.   Restaurant: It is a large and clean Chinese buffet. It can accommodate large parties and have everyone eating very quickly. There are 5 stations, a sushi station and a chef to make lo mein and rice noodle combos at your request. They have some American options as well, ex: ribs, meatballs, breadsticks, chicken wings, pizza, ham and sometimes steak. They have a wide selection of Chinese food, white/fried rice and soups. Also, there is a dessert station, 1/5 mentioned, with ice cream in the cooler and confections. They keep everything in well rotation and if they notice you depleting a specific item they will make it fresh and refill it.   Staff: They have laser sight on your drink and will not ever let it run dry. There is minimal interaction due to buffet but they will clear your plates and be attentive to your needs. Sometimes they will be pushy to get you your check, but it is out of goodwill that I have noticed. From my experience they aren't trying to rush you out, simply being extremely attentive.  My experience: I go here about once every two weeks. It's great after a long workday and a good reward for a hard workout at LA Fitness nextdoor (many protein options). Never have I left disappointed or had a bad experience. (+25 visits) Restrooms and facility is always clean and I have never thought twice about food prep or sanitation."}
{"text":"This buffet is excellent value.  The food is reasonable, the sushi is not bad, and the grill provides fresh stir-fried dishes to order, which is always nice.  I would really like to give them 3.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't provide that option.  It's not gourmet food, but gimme a break--it's 10 bucks!  You can spend more than that at McD's.  That's why I say \"excellent value\"."}
{"text":"The waiters just stood around watching me and my friend eat, studying us as if we were lab rats. Then every once in a while they laughed and talked in a different language, probably saying \"look at these fat Americans eating this discusting fried shit\""}
{"text":"Solid three stars for this place. The food isn't phenomenal, but it's do-able and a nice switch up from the other chain restaurants in Monroeville. I agree with another reviewer who said this place is hit or miss--I've gotten the food fresh and piping hot, and totally bland and dried out.   I wish they had better variety, but for a $10 buffet I don't expect all that much either. Mostly miscellaneous meat covered in various brown sauces, and a bunch of staples like rice, lo mein, various soups, and a cold bar option. Plus for having a sushi bar that isn't 100% sketchy and a hibachi grill that is included in the meal price. All in all, this place is way better than any of the other failed Americanized Chinese buffets in the area, so give it a try."}
{"text":"Consider this a 2.5 rating.  I wanted to like Fortune Star.  Upon walking in, it's a very attractive venue and from the looks of the enormous buffet, it certainly looks inviting.  There are fruit, salad, non-Asian food such as pudding and mac-n-cheese, lots of appetizers, main courses, noodles, rice, soups, even sushi.  The staff is very efficient and polite.  What's not to like, right?  Well, I sampled several of the offerings and the taste was just not quite right on a lot of it.  The cantaloupe looked delicious, but was hard as a rock, not quite ripe enough.  The General Tso's chicken was dry on the inside and if you had a blindfold on would not recognize it as being General Tso's chicken.  Hmm.  Maybe it wasn't. The green beans had no taste whatsoever.  After that, I was a bit hesitant to try the sushi.  Buffets are buffets.  It's difficult to have that much food available to their patrons and for us patrons to expect it to be fresh and tasty, I suppose.  Go for quantity and a fast meal."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times but yesterday put an end to it. We were there as they were switching over to dinner. No big deal. However, my son asked for something and there was no yellow sticker. So we got it for him. The waitress decided to fight with us so we showed her that there was not a sticker. Afte talking to her co workers she decided to walk up and take the plate from him as he was eating. Who does this even after being shown that there were no dinner markings? The hostess gave him back some more of what he was eating. HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"The only thing that is objectionable about the Monroeville location is the middle aged lady who serves as host at lunch.  It would be hard to find a more glum, unfriendly person in the hospitality business.  If this lady was a tipped employee and treated customers the way she does, she would starve.  Other than that, this place is great, offering a vast array of quality food at a bargain price!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill since opening. The food was down right discusting. My wife and I stopped in at 230. Still lunchtime right? Wrong!!!! Meal was over $35. It wasn't worth the $8 or $9 I was expecting to pay, let alone $35. When we asked I was told it was now after 3pm, sorry. Ad the owner/manager lady that works the front could be more unfriendly and unwelcoming. We won't be back. Hopefully they close soon and a good Chinese place comes in."}
{"text":"Great time with longtime friends. The buffet was fresh with anything you can possibly want. The seafood saute was great."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, I too am not a fan of buffets. However I've had two great experiences there meeting the girls out for dinner. Sushi and Hitachi are good.  As are the dumplings and the hot and sour soup.  Everyone found something to eat and  like including a little steak for those not find of Asian food. Servers are pleasant, no rushing. And it is BYOB with no corking fee"}
{"text":"Went here twice with consistent results; once for dinner and once for lunch. Their buffet is ginormous and includes a huge variety of stir fry platters, seafood, American food, sushi, desserts, fruit and even a Mongolian grill. The value is good and the waitstaff is quick and polite. I love the dumpling dipping sauce they have and the little cakes are so tasty! Their baked mussels and clams are wonderful and the location is great. Highly recommend!  I am not even a buffet fan, but this place did not disappoint."}
{"text":"My wife and I started off our vacation week by going to Fortune Star because we worked at home all day and were very hungry.  We never go to Chinese buffets or any buffets but we actually had a gift card from our wedding (4 years ago) from here that we had never used so we needed to use it.  I'm glad we finally did.         I think it's a decent buffet.  If you're looking for great food don't go to a buffet.  This place is good if your hungry and want to eat a lot but not spend a lot but still have a good time.  It's good for kids too which is nice.       We walked in and this place is huge.  I believe this used to be a Damon's so I can see how the space was utilized.  They sat us down in a booth.  The table and buffet wasn't sparkling clean but it was clean enough for me to eat at and on.       We walked around to see what they had to offer and they have a ton of food.  I'm not going to name everything but they had almost everything.  I really had my doubts that this food would be any good with the amount of food they had but it was good.         Was it 5 star gourmet food no but was it freezer burned food like a review earlier not at all.  It was decent Chinese food.  I liked the coconut shrimp and honey chicken the most.  My wife showed me their sushi which I was hesitant to eat but she liked it and I did try some tuna and salmon and it was good.  They have a hibachi grill in the back and that's what you need to do.  You can get fresh ingredients and have the chef grill some shrimp, chicken and beef.  The beef didn't look good to me so I got chicken and Carrie got shrimp.  It was nice.  Not expensive and we left very full.  What more can you ask for?  Next time we come here we won't eat as much though!  We rolled home...."}
{"text":"I typically avoid buffets specifically Chinese buffets so when my friends wanted to come here for dinner my girlfriend and I were both skeptical. I had seen it a million times going in to PetLand to play with the puppies and it just didn't look like anything special from the outside.   Once We walked in Alison said to me that this place was much bigger than she had expected. Looking around I saw row after row of fresh food all the way back to the wall. Strolling through I was very satisfied both by the apparent quality and abundant quantity of Everything from General Tsos, Won Ton Soup and even, now hang on stick with me, sushi. I would never have touched the sushi if it wasn't for the fact a man was making it as quickly as people were taking it.  Alison is a little more cautious than myself and opted for something I never expected to see: Hibachi. In the very back behind all the lines you can scoop up raw meat and veggies from a big fridge and give it to the Hibachi chefs and have yourself the freshest buffets around.   All of the food was STEAMING hot and tasted like the food from any standard takeout Chinese place. Except the sweet and sour chicken which was probably the best I've ever had. The batter was crispy and buttery all at once and was wrapped around insanely juicy chicken and of course I smothered it in delicious fresh sweet and sour sauce.   So here I was sitting at a buffet with a fresh sushi bar and hibachi grill but the thing that surprised me the most: cleanliness. We've all had to try and enjoy a meal in a dirty grungy restaurant, but at the Fortune Star that is not an issue. The staff was extremely efficient constantly cleaning tables and buffets while never getting in the way. Not once did I see the all too familiar piece of chicken floating in the beef, or the green beans that have somehow migrated into the corn.   What looks like your typical buffet on the outside will surely surprise you on the inside. I was so satisfied with my meal and the dinner cost was something like $11 per person. Of course I knew I had to wait and see what the girlfriend had to say before I could plan to come back. And I'm happy to say she somehow liked it even more than myself and so next time I want Chinese food this is where you will find me. And who knows maybe next time I'll be bold enough to try some of the more \"traditional\" looking offerings."}
{"text":"First off this place is clean with plenty of places to sit. Secondly, this place for lunch is only $9! This place has options of different seafood, meat, and veggie items. There's sushi, a hibachi station, and a verity of desserts. While the options and price are nice, the quality and taste of the food are 3.5/5. For the price though this place is good for lunch."}
{"text":"For 8.40$ for lunch is a pretty good deal + hibachi makes it even better the place is clean bathrooms are clean all in all a great place will be back"}
{"text":"The chinese buffet has many tasty choices. The staff is a little pushy however they are attentive. The food is good and plentiful for the price. The surrounding decor is interesting to look at whilst dining. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Just moving the Pittsburgh area from Southern CA, I was looking for a chinese restaurant but came across this buffet. Also, there are a lot of Asian buffets in Pittsburgh as well. To say the least, this buffet did not disappoint. It was clean and the food actually tasted good and not filled with salt and MSG like other places. The food actually looked edible. I enjoyed all of the chicken dishes that they had and the fried shrimp.   Now, this buffet has a focus more on Chinese food and wasn't trying to do the international thing like other places. So, if you strictly want Chinese food, this place will satisfy your craving. Also, I spent less than $10 on Sunday during lunch time. I think that's pretty good spending."}
