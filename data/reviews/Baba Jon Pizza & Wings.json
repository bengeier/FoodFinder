{"text":"The pizza is ok, not too thick, not too thin but it annoys me that they snip the pepperoni/salami in half to spread it out more. Like... What... Why. Toppings can be a little sparse, which is part of why I rated them a little lower. Sometimes, I find it a bit salty, but it might just be me because my family is all about it. 

I always get their honey garlic wings - they're a good size and the sauce is pretty decent. Other flavours are good too. 

Wish they'd get wedges as an option instead of fries, but this might not be an issue for most people. Also, would be better if they packaged them separately when you do take out so the fries aren't completely soggy by the time you start eating. 

Always check your order when you do pickup. If they're even the slightest bit busy, orders get mixed up.
Delivery is fairly speedy, but expect delays on Saturday nights."}
{"text":"While looking for some place new to try, we stumbled across this place and placed a pick up order for wings & fries.  The wings were great, they were all that i thought they would be.  The special was for 10 wings and fries for $10.  I had the honey garlic wings, and they were pretty good, however the fries, well they were just the Costco fries, and rather typical if not boring and just ok.  So, as for service, well the guy behind the counter is one hard working dude trying to keep up with the lunch rush as it seems he was short handed.  But gotta love his attitude.  So, not a bad experience at all."}
{"text":"Great pizza store. What's the food different types of specialization, nice people and it's pretty cheap. The food is really good and my favourite is the regular poutine. Their delivery also usually comes within 30 minutes and I've never had any problems. 

The actual store it's probably not the nicest. I wouldn't recommend but takeout is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Good poutine and very affordable. If you're in a rush and want a good bite I'd come here. The pizza is pretty good as well"}
{"text":"They really have good customer service and also their pizza reminds of Italian pizza when I used to eat. Yummy pizza"}
{"text":"Come here about once a week. Really good customer service, prices are good and quality is top A1. I usually get their walk in special pizza. Much better than pizza pizza. They Have AMAZING boneless wings, ask for the triple dip. Poutine is good, shawarma is good too as long as it's earlier in the day. Place is clean and the owner is super nice."}
{"text":"Love the staff here. Extremely nice and helpful. It's a small pizza shop tucked away in a plaza on Brock road. The wings are only second to Pizzaland. Get the triple dip wings! It is best sauce they have. 

The pizza is amazing here. They cut in weird slices and the last time I went they did not have many soda selections. Probably the only issues. 

Best halal pizza pizza place in Pickering."}
