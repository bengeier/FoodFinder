{"text":"It pains me to give Santorini a 2-star review. After all, my family has been coming here for over 10 years and have celebrated many milestones including birthdays and anniversaries. 

We had called in a reservation for a small group (which I'm pretty sure they didn't write down properly) and were tucked away in one of the empty front rooms, separate from the main dining area. It was a beautiful, warm summer night so we requested to be seated on the patio. The owner said it was \"too windy\" and \"going to rain\" (neither of which were true) and instead, allowed his staff to drink and smoke on the patio. Putting your needs before that of your customers is always a bad business decision. 

We had 2 or 3 different waiters who were intrusive, hovering around and clearing each plate the second we put our forks down. It made us feel unwelcome, uncomfortable, and extremely rushed. I don't go out to a nice restaurant with the intention of, or expectation to, scarf my food like I'm at McDonald's.

The souvlaki entree used to cost around $15-18 and has jumped in price to $21 for an embarrassingly tiny portion of rice, and lemon potatoes with zero lemon flavor.

I'm sorry to say that after having been one of my favorite restaurants for over a decade, I won't be returning to Santorini any time soon."}
{"text":"Held my moms 60th birthday for 14 people in one of their private rooms.  Set menu was great. Fairly priced and great options. Service was fantastic. I would definitely recommend Santorini an event."}
{"text":"I will start by stating the food is excellent and prices for the restaurant meals are decent. I DO NOT recommend hosting an event here.  
The owner LIES! Do not book anything without having everything signed by dennis on paper!
His word means nothing with a hand shake.
He ripped us off so bad during payment of an engagement party and then did the same at my co workers baby shower.  For the prices per person he ended up MAKING us pay at the end of the events is more then a banquet hall!  

we could've gone to one of those facilites for better service.  It's sad I didnt ask for more word of mouth reviews, because from what I'm hearing, it would've been an easier decision"}
{"text":"As good as it gets for Greek. Why go to the Danforth?  The best lamb chops you will find in Toronto.  It loses a star because there are a couple of wait staff that should be working in a supermarket, not in customer service."}
{"text":"Excellent food service and atmosphere. Been here numerous times and never disappoints. Much better than the Greek restaurants on the Danforth."}
{"text":"This is a real gem near Lake Norman. The decor is upscale but not pretentious - subtle lighting, linen napkins, well spaced tables and booths.The owner, Oretsi Arsi, greets guests and seems genuinely interested in their experience. The menu includes Greek favorites (salads, gyro platter) as well as artisan touches (stuffed salmon, Mediterranean inspired steaks). There is also a surprisingly extensive cocktail menu and wine list, all at reasonable prices. The desserts are also worth a mention - rather than the traditional and overexposed baklava, they have delicious chocolate, cheesecake and coconut options. Great for date night."}
{"text":"Delicious. I had moussaka and dolmadakia and avgolemono, my sister got the Opa and tzatziki, all of it was amazing. 

Atmosphere was nice although we forgot to dress up"}
{"text":"My friend and I decide to explore something new in the area. Something nice and different. This place is so amazing. The food is incredible. The service is exceptional. The atmosphere is very welcoming. Definitely a good place for different occasions...dates, family dinners, etc. The bread is amazing by the way! Definitely a place to come back to!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. By far the best Greek restaurant in York Region... Will definitely revisit"}
{"text":"We have been going to Santorini for years but hadn't been in about two years. This summer you can't keep us away. We have been three times in a month. The food is some of the best Greek food in the city and is right up there with restaurants on the Danforth and even in Santorini!!  The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the patio is very pleasant."}
{"text":"I dined here with my family on the weekend for a special dinner out. We used to frequent Santorini but hadn't been there in some time. Fortunately, they did not disappoint this time around! The service and food were great. 

Our party of three started off with the avgolemono soup. We then shared the \"dinner for two\". While somewhat pricey at $75, it was a reasonable deal considering all three of us ate and we still had leftovers! The Greek salad starter was excellent. The platter of meat then came out - salmon, moussaka, lamb chops, steak, and shrimp. They were each delicious. It was served with rice and vegetables. The vegetables were on the under-cooked side (carrots were still very crunchy) but overall, the food was great. 

As we were celebrating a birthday, the restaurant provided a piece of the most delicious 3-layer chocolate mousse cake. 

Overall, we enjoyed our visit to Santorini. The 4/5 rating is only due to their increasingly steep prices, but I suppose that is to be expected given the higher end of the restaurant and pricing trends these days."}
{"text":"Its an underwhelming kind of place. Overpriced on most stuff. The food was ok, but not great. Mr. Greek has WAY better food for much less. I dont know how this place survives. I went once and not since, and will likely not go back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Santorini for the past 15 years or so. Throughout all these years not much has changed... and that's a good thing!  I echo the comment below about how it's the best Greek food in Toronto. I'd much rather go to Santorini instead of going down to the Danforth.

Food is excellent, ambience is great and the staff is friendly. Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"The dinner here was great.  Everything we ordered exceeded my expectations.  The atmosphere was elegant and calming.  The staff was friendly and food was delivered in good time with a good portion size.  The bread with olive oil and herbs great!  The desserts also great.  I had the Ravioli de Mer and my husband had the Mousaka.  Both of us were impressed!"}
{"text":"Last night shared the most tender and flavorful lamb chops anywhere and exceptional sea bass fillet! Everything was perfectly cooked including fresh veggies! My second visit within 4 days during Toronto visit. Wish I could come once a week! Friendly, warm efficient staff. Could give 10 stars if allowed!!!"}
{"text":"Best greek food in the city. Better than the danforth. I have had almost everything on the menu and the quality is superb.
Stand out dishes:
taramasalata
avgolemeno soup
horiatiki salad
grilled calamari
dolmadakias"}
{"text":"Considering they peg themselves as a high end mediterranean restaurant, if you removed the white table cloths, the pricey menu and the fancy lighting you would consider it a low end Mr. Greek. We went there on a Saturday night with an 8:15pm reservation. We were seated at 9:30pm because our table's 6 person 5pm reservation wanted to hang around for 4+ hours. The maitre'D, Theresa, tried to express her apologies for the delay, but she didn't see it fitting to tell the 5pm reservation that there was another reservation waiting for the table. She didn't want to be rude, however, making us wait over an hour standing at the front was ok with her. Her reasoning was that they may get blasted over social media. Their accommodation for the wait was to cover the first round of drinks. While we stood waiting for our table, we were bumped and pushed by incoming diners. Even the delivery of centerpieces for the next day's event was pushed through at 9pm amidst that crowd and we stood beside other diners' tables to make room. Ridiculous! 
When we finally sat down, our waiter ran through the specials and expected our order right there and then with no time to look at the menu. The fact that the kitchen closes by 10pm he needed our order right away. Well isn't that the kicker; they made us wait over an hour WITH a reservation and now there's no time for us to sit and enjoy a relaxing meal. The waiter was hovering over us because he wanted to get out of there. This went on right to the end of our meal.
Now the food: The menu was nothing special and the grilled chicken I ordered wasn't even edible. Too much spice, tough and dry. My husband's lamb souvlaki, a staple at any greek restaurant, was average and could've been served at the local Mr. Greek take out. Very disappointing meal!
Now the loud racket of conversation: I'm Greek and can get very loud especially when having a good time, but the waiter/owner, not sure exactly who he was, came to the table beside us and spoke so LOUD and cackled that we couldn't hear ourselves speak. It went on for a good 10 minutes and became so distracting that our table went silent until he finished. It was so unprecedented to get that kind of loud chatter in a \"fine dining establishment\". Sorry, but that was the worst experience we've had. 
The really troublesome part is that I was still eating my meal when they began clearing the table and I felt extremely rushed. We were offered coffee and dessert but could tell the waiter was relieved when we said no. 
This was not my first visit, but definitely the last. There is no excuse for poor service, unless you just don't care but when you charge $24 for a plate of grilled chicken that was 1/4\" thick and tough as nails, you need to reevaluate your establishment. They've been around since 1995 but if they keep the \"xorio\" (village) standard going, they will lose what they've built. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I have literally not had a bad meal here. I have held and been to many events here and they're always well run and the food is top top quality. The surf and turf is the best I've had in the GTA."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 6:30pm on a Thursday to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. Not so busy upon arrival, which had us seated immediately. The waiter was quick to ask for our drink selection. As we waited, bread with dip and beans were served. By the time he came back, we had decided on what to order for dinner; we chose the \"Dinner for 2\" at seventy-five dollars. Shortly after he left, our fairly large Greek salads were delivered. The dressing was perfect, not too sharp or drenching, and they weren't frugal with the feta cheese. The main meal was astronomical! We couldn't finish, but we ordered dessert anyway . 
Service, ambiance, food, price and location was perfect! Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday and so we booked a private room. The room itself looked very clean and I loved the decor. 

Food: 10/10 - the hummus that comes out with the bread was a hit at our table! MMM MMM good. Our entire table of 12 ordered souvlaki plates and the meat (chicken, lamb, pork) was so juicy and tender. Also a huge hit at our table. Yum!

Service: 10/10 - they really know how to treat guests at Santorini. Not sure if the service was especially good since we were celebrating a birthday, but they did a wonderful job of making us feel right at home. Definitely a dining experience to remember. 

The food is reasonably priced and it's nice to have a restaurant like this so close to home. Will definitely be returning. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give 5 stars for the great service and nice atmosphere, but dinner didn't meet expectations.  We tried a few things on the menu. Unfortunately, all were lackluster.  The side dish of rice with peas/carrots tasted like it came from a box.  The vegetables were okay, not much flavor. The fish and steak were badly overcooked.  Dessert wasn't great either. Dinner entrees are in the $14-25 range, which puts them in the same tier as some of the best restaurants in the Lake Norman area and raises customer expectations.   

On the other hand- When we had lunch here, the sandwiches, fries, and service were outstanding.  I would recommend it as a good lunch spot, but we won't be returning for dinner.  With some tweaking, this could be a great restaurant. 

One prior reviewer complained about the bread being served in olive oil- we actually loved that part of the meal!  You can't please everyone. :)  I would also recommend trying the hummus."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 6.5/10
Food: 7.5/10
Atmosphere: 7.5/10
Service: 5.5/10

Full context - we sat on the patio so commentary on the atmosphere is not reflective of the restaurant's inside. 

There was nothing wrong with the experience until the end. The food was good/fine, though I would say that this place is crazy expensive considering what they are offering ($26 for a souvlaki plate which, if you look at the photos, includes 1 stick of meat, a tiny portion of rice and 3 pieces of vegetables?!). 

I didn't finish my meal and when the server was putting the remainder into a takeout container, I noticed he did not put the tzatziki in. So, I asked if he could give me some extra to take away. 

My friends and I are chatting for a bit after this, to the point when the server's shift had ended. He left without letting us know, which forced us to go inside and ask for the bill ourselves. 

That's when I see the note on the bill: Extra tzatziki - $4

As an established Greek restaurant, I expect the kitchen is swimming in this, so it seems a bit crazy to me that they would charge, and beyond that, not let the customer know of this charge! 

Take it as you will, but I found the end of the meal ruined the otherwise normal experience. 

THE BOTTOM LINE: be ready to pay a lot for an otherwise underwhelming and disappointing Greek restaurant experience."}
{"text":"You want Authentic Greek? This is where the buck stops.

I will be a loyal customer for as long as I can. The food is excellent, the portions are incredible and the quality, oh the quality!

Try the Calamari and the Exohico is the BEST I EVER HAD!

You guys make Greek food the way it should be. THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Greek restaurants in the city. It is worth the drive here if you don't live locally.

We've been here on numerous occasions and we've never been disappointed. The staff are all great and the family who owns the place is very active and involved. 

The quality of their meats are top notch. The lamb souvlaki melts in your mouth and it is wonderfully marinated and cooked. The food is presented nicely with perfect size portions. The tzatziki is AMAZING, which is one of my markers for a great authentic Greek restaurant. 

The prices are higher than some other Greek restaurants but it is definitely worth what you're getting here. 

Having been to Santorini in Greece, the restaurant is very authentic with the look and ambience. It is both traditional and modern in decor."}
{"text":"Entrees were excellent, great drink menu and great atomoshpere.  Main reason I have 4 stars instead of 5 is that the baklava wasn't so good."}
{"text":"2.5 stars

I have been saving this review for a while, and actually, have been to this restaurant a couple more times which has affected my overall rating.

My first time here was in a private room for a late Father's Day dinner. Service was great and the food was good (nothing outstanding). I am not sure how I missed this restaurant since I drive by the plaza quite often, but there is a nice patio as well.

Because we had such a good time for dinner, my parents and I decided to go back to try the patio. Service was on the slower side, but the food was still good.

The last time around, the service was bad. We had the same waiter as the one who served us Father day's and his demeanor was totally different. Banging dishes around and cleaned plates that still had food. We felt he was angry with us.

As for food, typical Greek Fare: your various dips, salads, meats and grilled whole fish. That night we were out of the patio, they were out of two whole fish types, so I just settled for a souvlaki.

I think for this area, with no other immediate Greek restaurants, this is as good as it gets. But overall, there are Greek restaurants in TO with better food and service."}
{"text":"One star for excellent food... Other than that service was horrendous.  We had a company xmas party and we had only 2 waiters to serve 60 people.  One was extremely rude too.  If you open up a decent restaurant like such and expect to serve good food only no customer service because you under hired your staff then rethink your objective."}
{"text":"A definite A-Ok place.

Came to Santorini Grill with my friend around 3pm for a midday meal on a Saturday... A Lunner? Dunch? Either way it was practically empty since it was between service.
But the gents working there were still accommodating.  We started off at the patio but it got too windy so we transfered inside.

Food was good. Greek fries, dolmas, zucchini tower and grilled calamari. Nothing mind blowing tho, but then again, we just got small apps and didn't try the entrees.

The space is pretty big and there's lots of parking. They have few private rooms and a decent patio.  One of the guys mentioned that all the tables were booked for dinner (starting @ 5:30), which was why we ended up at the patio in the first place.

Will definitely come back to try the entrees... Be sure to make reservations.
For now I'll give them 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food. Free home made Bread and pate spread is delicious. Love the chicken souvlaki dinner. Nice atmosphere as well. Been here about 10 times in the last five years and never disappointed. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great decoration and food. If you are craving for a good Greek food and don't want to travel to Danforth this is a great place. The ambiance makes you feel like you are really at Santorini. 

My mom had Octopus on Pita and it was perfectly cooked. My wife had Chicken Souvalaki which was as expected. I ordered Steak on Pita which was bit over cooked but the steak was big and meat quality was great it was still very enjoyable for $20 I would do it again."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in in the GTA. beautiful bright ambiance. Excellent service. Delicious and ample portions. My favourite place to take clients."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently decided to give Santorini Grill a try.  This location has been many restaruants over the past 10-12 years, from Mexican to 2 or 3 different Italian establishments.  All of them have had excellent food, it's just not the easiest location to get in and out of and that seems to be the main reason that they've failed in the past.  That being said; Santorini like the others before them has excellent food an elegant decor.  The appetizer list is eclectic and very tasty.  My wife and I chose Specofai a spicy sausage dish and it was great.  I'd make it a full meal if I could.  We then had the Mousaka, some of the best I've ever had.  The portions are very substantial.  My wife and I hardly ever order 2 apps and 2 full meals.  We split the Specofai and the Mousaka and were both comfortably full when we left.  They have a killer dessert menu, too.  Santorini also has an extensive wine list, from moderately priced to some pricey selections.  We chose to stay in the economical range, had a very nice bottle of red Zinfandel and enjoyed it very much.  All in all Santorini Grill is one of the best restaurants to fill this space and we hope they will stay there for quite some time to come.  Needless to say we will return again."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Started with the pan fried kalamari and the saganaki \"opa\".  The Saganaki was PERFECT, a must try for sure.  They also give you free bread to start and its super fresh and comes with a dip of some sort.  

I had the moussaka for my main and this was great.  My only complaint is that there was too much ground beef in proportion to the veggies, and not enough potatoes (the potatoes on the bottom were SO good). Comes with a side of rice and veggies too.  All around fantastic place for greek food in thornhill."}
{"text":"Loved the decor and ambiance. Cute place for a date. Food came in huge portions, and the service was good. Really enjoyed the bread and bean salad that came before our meal.

Wasn't very hungry so I ordered the mussels off the appetizer menu. It was very rich, and came deshelled in a bowl--I'm not used to that, but I liked it! Less hassle and lots of mussels. 

Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"The Yelp summary shows only 2 dollar signs ($$) -- are you kidding me? This is a super expensive $$$$ joint. My problem is that my wife and I remember this place when it first opened. Back then it was great food AND great prices. Somewhere along the way they decided to cater to the upper-end crowd (a polite word for wealthy) only, and the prices went through the roof. Their signature Greek salad for example is more than double what we used to pay and the portion is actually smaller. Same across the board. I completely understand the concept of restaurants that cater only to upscale clientele (\"if you have to ask what it costs, you should not be there in the first place\") but it is sad to see a family neighbourhood restaurant go down that path."}
{"text":"Lovely Greek gem hidden out here in Thornhill. Generous portion sizes and of good quality. Had the dolma, but the rice was stiffer and drier than expected. The octopus was fresh and tender, but the hummus did not pair well. The moussaka was excellent and filling. Sea bass was decent, if forgettable. It's a 3.5/5. Had it been slightly less expensive would be a 4/5."}
{"text":"Nice place, the decor looks really fancy. The sea bass and the saganaki was delicious. The steak was just ok."}
{"text":"Same prices as better Greek places on the Danforth; same quality as Jimmy the Greek. But it's one of few sit-down restaurant options where it's located so if you're stuck in T-hill, this'll do."}
{"text":"A classic but authentic Greek restaurant situated in an historic Thornhill home.  You can come here with just your loved one, but the experience is best gained by dragging the whole family out.  Kids and grandparents alike love this restaurant.  

Great service from long term employees, freshest of fish, and consistent in quality.

I recommend the always favorite saganaki, OPA!  And the rack of lamb (order it rare)."}
{"text":"Great venue and staff! We were the DJs there for a recent wedding! The food was amazing! Great work! Staff is fast!"}
{"text":"The best Greek restaurant I have been to outside Greece.  Food is authentic, the place is inviting and staff are courteous."}
{"text":"Had my birthday dinner at Santorini Grill last week.

The restaurant is in an old farmhouse that was moved from somewhere on Bayview to its current location. It's quite nice inside!

Service was above and beyond. 

Reasonable prices for very generous portions. I would even recommend for you to share a main entree and order some apps. 

Heaps of parking as it's in a plaza.

A solid four star !"}
{"text":"Amazing place!
Great service 
Lobster pasta (special of the day) was amazing.....
Calamares melted in your mouth!
Recommended to make reservation!"}
{"text":"A wonderfully romantic spot, in the heart of Thornhill.

While the location is a bit odd, it is an historical building, and it looks great, both inside and outside.

The food is pretty good, with an excellent selection, and wine list accompanying the food also has an excellent selection.

I found some of the food to be overly acidic, but this may boil down to my preference in terms of regional cooking in Greece.

I will definitely return, multiple times, as I've enjoyed every moment."}
{"text":"$25.00 for a chicken souvlaki dinner that was tough, dry and overcooked! The server made a face when I told him, and then walked away, which is what I am going to do with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here with a few family members - all of us Greek - and was wonderfully surprised at how good it was. The food, drink, and service were all excellent.  Not a very convenient location for us non-car folks, but c'est la vie. The entire meal was delicious, end to end. Complimentary taramosalata to start was great. Fried calamari appetizer wasn't too heavy or greasy, with a village salad that didn't skimp on the cheese. We then had the lamb chops, which were phenomenal. Pricey but totally worth it. Next were the ribs, also very good but probably the weakest dish of the night. Finally we shared baklava for dessert and it rivalled my grandmother's: not too sweet or sugary. Service was great all evening and we were very well cared for, with waiters having good recommendations and wine pairings, and water and bread always full. This place competes with some of the best, traditional Greek restaurants I've been to, but probably doesn't get the recognition it deserves because of the location. But I'm OK with it staying a lesser-known gem."}
{"text":"We had been to the Santorini in Hickory and loved the food so I was excited to hear we would have a location closer to us.  Finally had the chance to visit last night and was very happy with our experience.  The decor very nice.  The food was awesome.  We started with the hummus with warm pita and I could have made of meal of that.  They also brought fresh bread in olive oil with herbs which was very good.  We ordered the ceasar salad with grilled salmon and one of their specials; pan-seared mahi with roasted vegetables and rice pilaf.  We were too full for dessert but it sounded wonderful and we plan to save room next time."}
{"text":"I went here many years ago on a recommendation.  I was told to get the lamb chops.  I don't like lamb.  I was still told to get them and assured that this is not like other lamb.  So I got them.  Since that time about 5 years ago I've been back a dozen times.  Each time I have ordered the lamb chops and each time they have been mouth watering perfection.
The lady hostess is very friendly, funny,  and helpful.  Some of the waiters are aged and monotone.  The crowd of people going here tend to be \"alta cockers\".  Yiddish for old farts.  Would love this place to be a bit more appealing to the middle aged or younger crowd.  I feel old when I go here.  But the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Please note, my price estimate does not include booze.

I was looking for a restaurant for my girlfriend and I in a particular area so it was hard to be choosy. We both love Greek, so this seemed and obvious choice (since it was a celebration). However, the service reviews made me wary. Fortunately, we had no such issues.

The decor is beautiful. Despite having a fairly open dining room and a few hard surfaces, it wasn't loud; the fountain in the middle drowned out most ambient chatter from neighbors.

The food was awesome. We were dropped some of the house bread with a delicious red-pepper feta dip. The house bread, however, was the only bread and it was *crusty*. The saganaki could've used a little more lemon and given that the aforementioned bread was not strictly appropriate, a little hard to spread.

I ended up having the 3-course menu special which was the crab cakes, beef and cheesecake for thirty dollars. For the quality of food, this was a great deal. The crab cakes were delicious, the beef and cheese sauce melting and tender. Even the vegetables were bright tasty. My only complaint about the main course was that both my friend and I got long, semi-thick diagonal slices of carrot which weren't quite cooked and hard to cut.

The cheesecake was frankly the major downfall of the meal. It was over-sweet and I don't know what was supposed to be raspberry about it; perhaps some were waved at it in the kitchen.

The waiter was prompt but almost-absent. That's frankly the kind of waiter I prefer. His timing was dead on; we never had to ask where a course was nor for the cheque.

I would definitely make an excuse to do Santorini again."}
{"text":"Came here in the afternoon.  Ordered the greek beer, saganaki appetizer (fried cheese), octopus pita with greek salad, and fried calamari dinner. 
 I never had saganaki in Canada, but I have had it in Athens, Greece and so I was left a little disappointed, as it wasn't crispy and more just soggy and just really really greasy, but maybe they do it differently in Santorini Greece I really don't know.  The saganaki tastes ok, just not what I expected.  
The octopus pita with greek salad was very good.  The octopus was very very tender, highly recommended.  Even the greek salad was done better than most places.  
The fried calamari dinner was delicious as well.  
Ambience was nice with white walls and portraits of Santorini Greece and a fountain in the centre, a little bit of flies but I guess it may be hard to avoid with the warm weather and opening and closing of doors otherwise it would have been perfect .
Everything besides the saganaki in my opinion was just mouthwatering and so delicious definitely one of the better Greek restaurants in Toronto and GTA area."}
{"text":"Good ambience and quality food. The hummus that came with the bread was a pleasant addition to the traditional olive oil. I had the braised lamb and combined with the bread in the beginning, I was stuffed! Calamari was very well done as well, with a generous portion to boot. Only took off one star because they have one draft beer on tap, otherwise this place is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We go frequently but recently we had a very poor experience. Service was great. 2 of 5 dinners were cold. My hubbie had seafood stuffed in pastry and it was cold in the middle. My dads top layer of ribs were fine but bottom were cool. The meals are expensive $35-40, not acceptable. We are not picky. Others had lamb ribs (excellent), lamb stew (very good) & chicken souvlaki (good)."}
{"text":"This restaurant has gotten a makeover in recent years and the interior is just lovely. The decor is romantic and the candles create a warm and intimate ambiance. The space itself is large with plenty of seating. The menu includes all the Greek staples and I loved the juicy and flavorful pork soulvakis. The bread and appetizers were also delicious. Overall a good option for Greek food Toronto North."}
{"text":"This is a review based on a bridal shower private event that I assisted with hosting. Party of approximately 30.

Service: Excellent. The wait staff was very attentive, patient, and helpful. With 30 guests, I was surprised that it went so smoothly. We were also allowed to bring our own desserts and they were kind enough to serve it to us, help set up our cake table, and provide cutlery and plates. They even collected pens for us because we had forgotten to bring our own for our shower games!

Food: Large portions, cooked very well. The guest of honour had chosen the first package from the private function menu ($29 per person, but it turned out toe be slightly less as we brought our own dessert).  At first, they served bread, hummus, and chickpea and bean salad for everyone to share (several at each table). For an appetizer, we had a choice between mixed greens Greek salad or Caesar salad, and for main course, we had the option of chicken breast or salmon. I ordered the Greek salad which came with plump and delicious Kalamata olives, and the salmon with a white wine cream sauce and grilled vegetables. The salmon was excellent. I find that salmon and chicken are often very easily overcooked at restaurants. I tried some of my friend's chicken and it was moist, although slightly salty, possibly from brining...? The salmon was moist and not dry at all. They provided huge portions, double what I usually cook for myself at home. 

Atmosphere: We were in the first private function room to the left of the restaurant. There were apparently two other events occurring at the same time. What was great about this place is that even though there were several events occurring at the same time and our private area didn't have a door, you couldn't tell that there were other parties happening because the rooms were in separate areas of the restaurant.

I would highly recommend Santorini Grill for a private event.  I also would definitely love to come back here to try the regular menu in their dining area."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, one of the best Greek restaurants in the GTA is not in the Danforth but all the way in Markham. You enter Santorini and are immediately hooked with it's whites and blues and curved lines and sunken seating areas - all of which transport you to Greece. Service was a bit slow and curt, but then you get to the food and you forget your impatience. Because the food was really good - Santorini reminds you what Greek food is supposed to taste like when done properly. We had:
- (Free) bread came with a really yummy salmon dip. We were going to order the dips they had on the menu but this was good enough.
- Halloumi cheese with fig spread and diced tomatoes: The halloumi was nice and firm, though some people may find it a bit rubbery. The fig paired perfectly with it - I ended up just rolling the cheese over and over again into the spread.
- Octopus appetizer: The octopus had just the right level of saltiness and was chopped into small pieces which made it good for sharing. The surprising star of the dish though was the bed of mushed eggplant that the octopus was on.
- Grilled calamari: We got this for our main and it was a big enough serving for 2. I know many people here have reviewed the calamari though I think most have got it deep fried. Definitely try it grilled - done so well it melts in your mouth. And the red cabbage they pair it with has a sweetness that contrasts the 'milkiness' of the calamari and perks up the dish.
- Truffle chocolate with devil's cake: Standard tasting, which was a bit of a letdown compared to the rest of the meal. We asked if they offered homemade Greek yogurt and sadly they have discontinued it.

I know you may find it a bit weird to head to Markham for a good Greek meal (vs downtown Toronto or to the Danforth). Put the biases aside and head over to Santorini - it's definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"The food may be ok but the service is terrible and because of that, only 1 star
we tried to book a party here and the \"party manager\" (aka daughter of the owner) was rude, didn't want to accomodate us at all (we want to change one of the entree options, we were told no; we wanted to add additional appetizers and PAY FOR THEM for the entire table and we were told no and that if we did that, we couldn't have a set menu for our guests). Her attitude was very \"you don't like it, don't have your party here\" and I know numerous people who have had the same experience. It's too bad there aren't more greek places in the 905"}
{"text":"I tried Santorini Grill on recommendation from a friend. Let me start off by saying, this is not like Mr Greek or any of those types of franchises. As I understand it, their cuisine is more authentic to the type of food one would experience in Santorini.  It's on the pricey side---but I must say.  The service and food quality was great.  (They have a lunch menu on weekdays that I'd really like to try, which is considerably cheaper)

The restaurant has its own parking area. Which was so helpful considering how busy the mall it's in is!  A parking guard came by to check I was really a restaurant patron when I exited my car. 

They start you with an excellent bread with hummus and a bean salad. I really enjoyed this.  The bread was hot and artisanal. We all enjoyed it with the hummus. 

I ordered the taramosalata to start. It is just the spread and does not come with pita. You eat it with the starter bread, but they will bring you as much bread as you like. I can honestly say it was the most delicious taramosalata I have ever had. It was also a very generous serving. I took whatever was left of it and the bread home...it was too good to leave behind!  

I ordered the fried calamari dinner, which came with spanakorizo (a rice with spinach) and veggies including carrots, green beans and a most delicious pickled red cabbage.  This dish was amazing. The calamari was perfectly cooked, the tzatziki was thick and strong (in a good way) and the sides were very good. 

My friend ordered Chicken Supreme which came with roasted potatoes and veggies, and absolutely loved her dish. She just raved about it. 

We were very happy with our meals and the service. We were far too full to try any dessert. 

While I enjoyed the food and service I can only give four stars. I did find the food quite overpriced.  

I definitely would like to go back one day for lunch to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Went for lunch last Saturday with the family. Santorini has never disappointed. We all had a variety of dishes. I ended up choosing the fried calamari dinner. It was pricey at $25 but the amount of calamari on he plate was substantial. The veggies and potatoes were cooked perfectly. The calamari was cooked to perfection but it was slightly salty for me. Not enough to deter me from eating I just noticed it was  a touch salty for me tastes. Overall great lunch. Always great at Santorini."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for years - perhaps even a decade. I remembered it as being somewhat expensive but good.

I just went again last week and i was blown away. The flavours aren't just good - they're phenomenal and worth every penny."}
{"text":"The decor is lovely, but I cannot recommend Santorini Grill because the food is just too expensive for what you get.

We started with the hummus dip. At $6.25, we expected a much better than average dip.  Sadly, it was not.  The hummus was somewhat thick, and I'm not really sure the pita was even homemade.

For our entrees, my hubby had the bouillabaisse ($21.95), and I had the Greek combo ($16.95).  The bouillabaisse was not bad, but not great, either.  We expected more high-end seafood for this price.  The spice they used in the broth also somewhat overpowered the dish.

My Greek platter was the best of our dishes, but nowhere near worth the price tag.  That was a $12 meal, in my opinion, no more.

We were really excited about having a Greek restaurant near our home, but I doubt we'll come back for dinner due to the average food and high prices."}
{"text":"Amazing place

I went there while me and my wife dated. Back in the day where the walls were painted with Greek scenery. 

Now they have stayed up with the times and it looks like a hip restaurant 

Great feel

I've had both my kids \"after baptism\" dinners here where we rented out whole restaurant for our guests and the food and service was great

I still come here with my wife for celebrations etc

Food - amazing. Large portions. It is pricey but u get quality. One negative -- which really isn't a negative is the free bread and olive mix they give u at the beginning is so good I am full by time entree comes !

Price - pricey but worth it for fine Greek dining

Service - great. Family run and they work hard to keep u happy. Even when ur reservation isn't ready they offer free drinks

Patio- great patio. Patio faces a parking lot but at night it's great to sit and have a bottle of wine with friends and just laugh and enjoy life 

All in all great place. Hopefully stays forever."}
{"text":"\"I have to take you to this place\" said my girlfriend. And so we went....

Atmosphere: 
Beautiful, open space. Very similar to \"Auberge du Pommier\". You can tell the waiters have been with the restaurant for a very long time. Also, they were extremely friendly. A nice huge bay window that would be lovely on a bright sunny day. 

Food:
I ordered the \"S W O R D F I S H   L A D O L E M O N O\" since I don't see that on the menu very often and I was feeling adventurous that day. (normally i dont order fish/chicken since i feel it's gonna be dry) And she ordered the G A L I N I  S E A F O O D\". 

My swordfish dish was horribly dry. It had beautiful grill marks, which can only mean one thing. Either it's perfectly grilled or a catastrophe. My dish was basically overcooked to the max. The vegetables were good... but man the fish was a disappointment since she hyped up the restaurant for me too.

As for her dish, I actually loved it. The pasta itself was thin and perfectly cooked, however the sauce was THE best part. It was sweeter than the normal tomato sauces I've tried. But, the shrimp was overcooked and a bit chewy. 

Overall: I'll try the Danforth next time I need a fix for greek food, please."}
{"text":"Best Greek restaurant in the gta. Forget the Danforth - if you want good Greek food come to Santorini. We had the Chicken souvlaki and the Calamari. Excellent. Terrific staff. Great night."}
{"text":"I was in the Thornhill area and the kids wanted Greek food, specifically Gyros. After a quick Yelp search, Santorini popped up as the closest place, and had a 4 star rating. We made our way to find out that Santorini is a stand alone restaurant from a converted house. I suspect that the place used to be the residence of farmers, and the farmland had been paved over. A parking lot and strip mall surrounds the home converted restaurant. The structure was maintained and the interior updated. Hues of blue and white splashed on the walls to give that picturesque ideal of Greece with white homes with blue tops. The decor a mix of old and new. Clean white linens and an open concept dining area mixed with the old structural charm of the house. Windows round the one side overlooking the outdoor patio dining area, and the parking lot beyond that.

Santorini is an island off the Greece coast, and when I was there way back in 2003, I had the best Gyro of my entire life! (no joke), and it was the cheapest meal we had to boot! So naturally, that's what came to mind when I saw the place on Yelp.

After we were seated, It was a complete 180 for me. The menu had authentic Greek dish, much like KouTouki Greek Cuisine (Niagara Falls) with Lamb Shanks, Beef, Steak, Chicken, Seafood, Grape Leaves, Moussaka, etc. And like KouTouki, they did not serve Gyros. I guess it's considered a poor man's meal, and this place just wasn't for the poor man. The prices were on the upper end of $$.

We ordered some Cheese Saganaki to start, a Pork Souvlaki dinner, Grilled Sea Bass, Kleftiko, and Shrimp Giouvetsi.

While awaiting our meals, we were served some fresh bread with butter. We were quite hungry at this point, and the bread seemed to have hit the spot in quelling in pangs. The bread has a good crust on it. Not too hard, and not too thick. The bread was soft on the inside, but not so soft that the butter would tear it. 4 stars.

Kefalotyri Saganaki. Saganaki actually refers to the vessel in which the dish served in and not the type of cheese. In Santorini, Cheese is seared in the saganaki and served on a plate; it's rectangular shape is kept, and the cheese remains firm. The cheese is ever so lightly battered with flour before searing. The most common of these semi-soft cheeses (sheep's milk) are Kasseri, Kefalograviera, or Kefalotyri (all are ~$13/lb). In North America, we add showmanship to the dish and flambé it with ouzo (anise aperatif)  or metaxa (Greek brandy). The dish is finished off with fresh squeezed lemon juice to help douse the flames. The result is a seared outside and melted inside. I'm definitely a fan of the N.A. version over the Greek one, not because of the show, but because I prefer ooey gooey goodness. 5 stars.

Pork Souvlaki. I thought it would be juicier than chicken (same price), but it wasn't. The control of the flame grilling could have been better.  The outside dried out to get it cooked to order (medium). 2,5 stars.

Mixed Baby Greens salad. This came with the pork souvlaki and the veggies were fresh. The dressing was a house Greek vinaigrette and was very flavourful. 4 stars.

Grilled Sea Bass. I was actually expecting more from this dish. It was cooked  thoroughly, but sea bass is a pretty lean fish, so flavouring and cooking is key, and here I think they came up short. The dish came with steamed veggies whose flavours were also lacking. Like most places the veggies were also overcooked and slightly mushy. 2,5 stars.

Kleftiko. Cubes of lamb wrapped in grape leaves wrapped in filo. The filo was crispy on outside, but signs showed signs of softening. The lamb was diced into small pieces and there was very subtle gaminess in the meat. The sauce was a gravy of sorts and on par. Grilled tomatoes, broasted potatoes, and asparagus finished the dish. The tomatoes had nice grill marks, but came at the cost of over cooking them. The asparagus was steamed but should have been grilled as they're more resilient to the heat. Overall the dish was just OK. 3 stars. 

Shrimp Giouvetsi. Grilled butterflied shrimp. They were the 26-30 ct. size so 6 pieces provided roughly a quarter pound. They were grilled nicely and not overcooked. 3-stars. The rice looked better than it was. There was not much flavour and it was a on the mushy side. 2 stars. The veggies were similar to those that came with the fish (tomato had nice grille marks but overcooked, and the asparagus was once again steamed when grilled would have been better.) Overall 2,5 stars.

From a price point, they were very similar to KouTouki, perhaps a smidgen higher even, and the food was not as good. Does it pass for authentic, I would say so. Does it pass for decent? Sure, some dishes do, but their prices don't. Once again, I seem to be going against the grain based on my rating, as only some elements of each dish was executed well. Overall 3 stars.

{"text":"The food was fantastic. Grilled octopus was super tasty. If you want a nice romantic dinner without having to drive downtown. This is the place for you."}
{"text":"Been a regular customer to this place for
Over 15 years now. 

One of the best Greek food spots in town, always great food, great service and atmosphere.

It's definitely not your casual gyro stop, it's a fine dining establishment, on the higher end side when it comes to
Quality, Prices and service.

The Saganaki Appetizer is a definite recommendation, I can't even remember a single visit where I did not order at least two of these.
Kalamari, and Octopus are always great and fresh..

Their lamb souvlaki, Shrimp, Sea bass and Salmon are always great options.
The place can also be reserved for private parties, spent a new years party here few years back, which was a night to remember with great food and drinks.
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Really good upscale Mediterranean food.  The appetizer trio is recommended, but the star IMHO is the spicy feta dip.  The tzatziki dip and the hummus were great, but man... Spicy feta.  I got the ratoutoille and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Santorini Grill is now my to go to Greek restaurant for uptown...

This restaurant is huge... It is a Summer House that is built 1858 over 150 years ago..and Santorini Grill has done a marvellous job to converted that into a nice charming restaurant. 

The inside is modern and cozy... and there are a lot of separate section of private ares that you can host a private party.. or in the Summer the huge patio..or in the main dining area with skylight and big windows...

Santorini Grill maybe the place that converted me to become a lamb lover... 

Lamb Souvlaki on Pita Bread ($14)
- Cooked Medium is nice and tender.. and well seasoned....
- Pita Bread Soft and Fluffy
- Mixed Salad has the perfect dressing and oh so good Feta cheese

I will be back again.... For the food and the ambiance...

I don't believe now I start having craving for lamb!!"}
{"text":"Tonight was a very confusing experience!

Thankfully opened on Victoria Day, I decided to gather a few friends of mine to Santorini for a girlfriend's birthday. The decor is nice and cozy (inside a home) and tables were formal. As we were looking at our menu, we got a loaf of bread with spread and beans.

Our meals came about 45 minutes later however those who had appetizers had their food first (that's a given). After eating our meals, some of my party complained of dry chicken, \"cheap\" rice but overall I thought my grilled chicken was decent and tasty (though I felt like it was missing a sauce with it).

We then told the waiters about my friend's birthday and they were nice enough to give us a complimentary cake! It was all well and dandy until we got our bill. We unfortunately didn't get the chance to ask for separate bills so we all calculated our part with tips and tax. All was paid and we proceeded outside to take picture. 

A (head) waiter then came out to us and asked us how our experience was. I honestly thought he was so kind to continue making sure we had a good dinner. It was then he kept saying that my party (of 8) left only 9 dollars tip! That's close to impossible and we were so confused on our part. He wanted to make sure that our lack of tip was not as a result of the customer service but we said other than the wait for food, the service was great. He kept saying how he didn't want money but wanted to know what happened. We didn't know what happened either because we were so confused with the $9 tip left (that means about $1.1 per person which is unreal)! 

There was great confusion on both ends but aside from this mishap that I guess we will never figure out, I wouldn't come back for the price and for the food we got.

Great customer service though and really thankful that my friend got a complimentary cake.

I had really high expectations for this place.......

I JUST READ THE POST BELOW AND OUR WAITER WAS DENNIS TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
