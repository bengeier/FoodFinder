{"text":"Currently, you can only have two flavors of fried chicken: original or sweet and spicy.  The original did not have too much flavor but you can add additional salt and pepper to it.  For sweet and spicy, it was much more tasty.  It also wasn't spicy at all.    It'd be better if they had more flavors to choose from like at other KFC restaurants.    The kimchi fries were really good though.    I'll likely return if they add additional items to their menu.  For now, I prefer going to other KFC places along Yonge."}
{"text":"Half the items we tried to order on the menu wasn't available. The conversation essentially went like this:  Table (of 9 people): places order Waitress comes back: Sorry we are out of the sous vide sirloin beef and rib eye Table: okay we will have ox tongue skewers and lamb skewers Waitress says okay and then comes back: Sorry we ran out of lamb skewers and Ox tongue Table: okay we will have the panini  Waitress says okay and then comes back: Sorry we don't have that either. Table: What do you have??  Oddly the sous vide sirloin and rib eye beef ended coming out, which was delicious. However, because of all the ordering and re-ordering, we had ended up ordering additional friend chicken thinking we wouldn't have the beef..so 3 chickens instead of the 2 we originally ordered.  The fried chicken wasn't great either, the basket i got had too much batter and i had to use my napkin to soak up some of the gross excess oil - I'd say the Fry or even Kokoya is better.   I dont think i'd come back here, maybe only for the sous-vide sirloin or rib eye."}
{"text":"Overall - 2.5/5.0  Gave an extra 0.5 for their courteous and attentive service.   Was a bit of a shocker when we were told that they did not have any fried chicken given that it was around 8:00 PM prime time. Servers were not aware of this until the order was put in so it seemed like the kitchen did not notify them about it beforehand.   We went with the sweet and spicy chicken wings instead and it was pretty subpar. The meat itself was moist but overly seasoned. The skin was overly battered which made it separate from the meat and bone with each bite.  On a more positive note, their spicy cheesy udon was done quite nicely, with reminisce of the cheesy topping of a freshly made pizza.  Will likely not repeat."}
{"text":"I love how cozy this sports bar is, and boss is also super friendly. It is connected to idarts so you can play a few game of darts after eating a good meal. There's also a side entrance to avoid getting IDed through the idarts entrance.   If you come here, you must try their chicken wings. The boss said it is deep fried in a pressure cooker, giving it a fluffy but crunchy texture. I love how they give you seasoning on the side as well because I don't like my wings too salty. You can also ask for hot sauce if your into that.   Service is superb; right as I sat down the waitress helped bring me water. Many restaurants wait until you ask them so that was nice. The girls working there are also super friendly and cute, they can help you recommend some starters if you are coming here for the first time.    There are also two idarts machine inside chix if idarts itself is full. That is a really nice feature, and chix can supply you with darts if you do not have your own.  Overall, very great experience!! I would definitely return again with more friends"}
{"text":"I'm not sure you'd ever find this place from driving by on the street. It's hidden in a corner of the 2nd floor of what looks like an office building on 7850 Woodbine, just south of the 407. The only reason why I ended up at this place is because I was at iDarts that evening, and recognized the Chix N Stix logo from a few friends on Instagram (well done on the social media front, guys).  The menu is here is pretty well summed up in the restaurant's name. They sell chix (Korean fried chicken, to be specific), and stix (a variety of skewers). They also have some side dishes as well as a sous vide steak that you have to preorder.   Not being too hungry, my part of 3 ordered the sweet n spicy half Korean fried chicken ($16, $11 special on Sundays!), pork belly wrapped kimchi stix ($6/2) and Korean marinated beef stix ($7/2). We also tried the spicy lamb stix ($1/pc on Wed/Thurs!).   The service was quite fast. We received our food as it was prepared, within 5-7 minutes or so.   The first item to come was the KFC. It was served in approximately 8-10 large spherical pieces. The twice-fried skin was crispy, and the white meat underneath was very juicy and moist. I think the skin could have been crispier, but the flavour was so good I didn't mind.  Next, the stix. The pork belly wrapped kimchi was the most \"out-there\" item on the menu. In reality, the pork belly wrapped around the kimchi resembled bacon. However, the flavour was distinct. It meshed very well together.   The lamb was my favourite - it was a much thicker and juicier cut than most lamb skewers that can be had at this price. I'd highly recommend their Wednesday/Thursday offer for $1/pc!  Lastly, the Korean marinated beef skewers were on point - a classic. Can't go wrong with that.   The prices here were very reasonable. I'm not from the area so I won't be back often, but I'll definitely make a return visit when I can."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place hasn't exactly officially opened until December but they're open unofficially to test out the menu, and work out the kinks before the official launch.  Finally! A place in Markham with Korean fried chicken and izakaya vibe, with a bar stocked with soju and sake.   I've actually visited this place twice. The first time I tried to come here, I had tried to call them the day of us wanting to go because seeing as it is newly opened, I wanted to see if it was worth going or if my friend and I should make plans to go somewhere else. I called for an hour without an answer, so my friend and I chose to see if by chance we can get in there, but they weren't able to accommodate us that night because they had a 40-person party that evening.  I finally got to have dinner here the other night with a reservation after calling a few times.  When we arrived, most of the tables were full but the restaurant looked kind of empty. We obviously had to order the Korean fried chicken (KFC), but we also got an order of kimchi fries and takowasa (raw octopus with wasabi served with nori).   The televisions on the walls played K-pop videos that was amplified through the sound system (though they did change one TV to basketball for a bit).  The takowasa was good and the KFC was as expected, crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside. Now don't get me wrong, fried chicken is my favourite, but the kimchi fries was amazing, it looked awesome when it was served and it tasted like it looked, a bunch of awesomeness happening in my mouth.  The owner, Monty, was there and check on us, he apologised for the state of the restaurant as it's not fully completed (the empty space), that there's still a few things left to do before the grand opening in early December.  I can see this be quite a happening place and I look forward to coming back again to see the fully finished restaurant and try more items on their menu."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Found out about this place via a friend who visited here in their first week of opening and he raved about their sous-vide steak, which is only available on Fridays and Saturdays, plus you have to reserve beforehand. I decided to give this place a try this past weekend as a result.  This restaurant is quite hard to find; you have to enter an office building, go up one of the sketchiest elevators in Markham, then enter iDarts Toronto and it will be on your right. Yes, you have to enter a darts building in order to actually enter the restaurant itself.  Chix & Stix is similar to the Korean bars that dominate Yonge between Finch and Sheppard; the menu has the Korean feel to it, and they play loud Kpop and other Asian music on TV screens.  In addition to the sous-vide steak, we ordered the fried chicken combo, grilled beef wrapped enoki mushroom, and takowasa. The takowasa came first, and for $5 it was quite good. The nori wasn't the best I've had, but it did its job in wrapping the raw octopus. It wasn't that spicy, but I prefer it that way as I'm not tolerant of spicy punches. The fried chicken combo came after, and while both styles of chicken were good, the sweet and spicy one is miles better than the regular one.  The sous-vide steak came after, and considering that was supposedly our main course I found it to be quite underwhelming. The steak they use was striploin, and while it was properly cooked I found it to be on the dry side. Since I'm used to steak being juicy and a bit on the thicker side, I definitely expected more from the hype. Finally, the beef wrapped enoki mushroom was mediocre at best, as it was wrapped extremely thin and all I tasted was charcoal.  Service was overall excellent.  While I admit the fried chicken was good, I'm quite sure there are other places in York Region/North Toronto that serve decent Korean style fried chicken too. Therefore I don't see myself returning here for the time being."}
{"text":"This place is connected to idarts so expect it to be packed, ordered the food combo that comes with chicken and kimchi fries, chicken wasn't bad, had fried and sweet and spicy, kimchi fried sucked, fries felt like it was microwaved and the weird tasting kimchi, avoid this  Pitcher of Sapporo was $20, wasn't too bad"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  Since it's hidden in iDart, it wasn't busy at all when we stopped by on a Friday evening.  Servers speak little English so we had some confusion when ordering, but overall service decent.  Pros: Kimchi fries are super good, better than bahn mi boys and better than han ba tang.   Cons: 1/2 fried chicken was super dry and all white meat. pork belly wrapped kimchi skewers were tiny and average at best. Prices a bit high for what you get.  I wouldn't be opposed to going back - nothing was awful - but wouldn't be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Little hidden gem...great atmosphere and food. Great service friendly staff....awesome kpop and sports on the big screens. Definitely check it out"}
