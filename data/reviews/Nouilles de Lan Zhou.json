{"text":"If fresh hand-pulled noodles is your thing, then you'll like this place -- so long as you are OK with ordering noodles with beef, scallions, and cilantro in broth.  That's all they have.  Your choices are small, medium, or large bowls of soup; spicy or not spicy.  That's it.  In fact, the only reason I haven't rated this restaurant higher is because the choices are so limited.  That, and the fact that it is small and cramped, which is not helped by the fact that there is a busy escalator in the middle of the place leading downstairs to a grocery store.  But that said, the noodles and soup are excellent.  A medium bowl is sufficient for most adult human beings.  In fact, my wife couldn't finish hers.  My tween daughter did just fine with the small.  The place is clean and new-ish looking, contemporary if undistinguished in design.  The picture windows in the front give a good view from the street of the noodle chef thwacking and twisting the noodle dough before stringing it into noodles.    I wouldn't call this a destination restaurant, but for a quick and tasty bowl of noodles, it will do just fine."}
{"text":"Huge huge huge portions. Seriously, get the small if you have a size choice unless you want leftovers for the next day. I had the beef tendon noodle soup, which only comes in medium and certainly served as my lunch and dinner that day. The tendon was cooked well and not too chewy. The broth was flavourful and reminded me of the dark Taiwanese beef noodle soup broth. The noodles were perfectly al dente and chewy, as advertised by the guy kneading away by the window.   My boyfriend got the dandan noodles. While this dish was very delicious, it's also extremely oily! Beware, if you have a sensitive stomach. In addition, they use copious amounts of peppercorn so be prepared for that numbing-spicy feeling in your mouth.   All in all, a pleasant, efficient meal for a great price. Also, don't expect a Micheline 3-star restaurant service; Asian countries have a different mentality towards service. You come to a place like this for the food, not the service -- keep that in mind when you see the poorer reviews!"}
{"text":"Very busy, very yummy. Tricky to get a table sometimes... Often. But turnover is pretty quick here. Worth the wait. They got that beef soup that is simply unrivalled. Get it spiced up. If you have room for a side I dig that cucumber salad with peanuts."}
{"text":"We went there during lunch time. Waited for 20 min to get a sit at the table. Waiter offered tiny table with one seat next to a door. We politely refused and decided to wait for the next available spot. Couple behind us decided to take that small table but left 2 min later due to constant wind and people bumping them. Waited for 10 min more. Table opened up, waiter came and told us it is for 3 people minimum. We left. Wasted 30 min here. There hundreds of restaurants around with better service and similar food. No need to waste your time here just to eat above escalator and a grocery store."}
{"text":"Their beef noodles are amazing!! Really great texture; you can just feel the hand-made dedication with each bite. The soup may look bland, but it's actually very flavorful, thanks to the Chinese parsley, spring onions, daicon and chili oil. I asked for medium spicy, and it was just right, though beads of sweat were literally forming on my face as I slurped each bite -- but I didn't care, because it was sooo delicious!   The beef comprised decent cuts of brisket, though nothing fancy. Portion sizes are very generous. I initially wanted to order a medium bowl of noodles as a set (which comes with an egg and a side dish of veggies), but the waiter told me that the medium bowl itself was enough to get me full, so I just went with noodles only. I'm not sure how anyone can physically manage to finish the large size."}
{"text":"There is nothing I love more than noodle soup. The noodles here are hand-pulled and phenomenal! Just the right amount of chewiness (I ordered the thick round noodles).   The bowls of soup here are HUGE. I ordered the medium and couldn't finish (I ordered the thick noodles, remember?). Everything was very fresh and I could see the lady in the kitchen area thoroughly washing all the veggies.   The broth is good and warming and I had mine with the chili oil so it had a little bit of bite to it, but not really spicy, so it was perfect. The only criticism is that the broth could have been a little thicker. All in all, I would come back here again!"}
{"text":"C'est vraiment pareil comme en Chine, mais la portion est trop grande! J'ai pris un middle, mais je peux plus bouger?Pratique et délicieux, un bon choix pour dîner."}
{"text":"The first time I went there, I found it was ok. But compared to other Ramen restaurants in Montreal, Nouilles de Lan Zhou is definitely a gem."}
{"text":"Best noodle place in town. If you haven't been there yet you must go. Very simple menu but great great food! The noodles are chewy and the meat is tender. It's great on a cold night and they have cold soup in the summer."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm soooo good. They make noodles FRESH right in front of you. I was feeling a bit home sick and I saw this noodle place and decided to give it a try. Sooo worth it!   The broth is clear - with the right balance - not too salty or bland. The noodles are fresh and chewy. The meat is moist when you mix it in the broth.   They have combos too. So I got a small noodle bowl+ some salad (3 options to choose from)+ tea egg for $13 w. tax.  If I come back to Montreal will definitely visit again :)"}
{"text":"Showed up 45 mins before close and they wouldn't seat me.  Only one choice of salad.  Acted like they were doing me a huge favour."}
{"text":"We felt a little bit out of place here...but the beef noodle soup was delicious and the portions were huge. My husband and I ordered the medium bowl and I couldn't finish it (my husband did). The ingredients were so fresh, the beef was so tender...very good! We were a little confused about the drink situation. They brought us two cups of tea automatically but I was unclear whether we could have ordered different drinks. There was a pitcher of water on the table with a lemon slice floating in it but we didn't have glasses to put the water in so I chugged my tea and poured the water in my cup. Overall, it was a good experience..."}
{"text":"Food: Probably one of the bests of it's kind in MTL in terms of hand-pulled noodles Lanzhou style. The broth is tasty but not too salty, and actually quite clear unlike some other places where it seems to be tainted by soy sauce. The meat is tender and no big pieces of FAT (yes that's a no-no). The noodles come in different sizes, made to order, cooked just right~ the most popular being erxi but i love mine flat, ye jiuye! Erxi tends to be more chewy and jiuye is softer, and due to the flat shape, coats in spicy sauce better :)  Service: Fast, efficient, nice  Price: redefining worth the price for the amount of noodle~  Ambiance: why the minus one star. Located above the busy Chinese supermarket, squeezed in a bathroom sized space, where u literally sit back to back with the person behind you, no place to put ur belongings beware! really, eat everything and leave, u don't want to linger here~"}
{"text":"Whenever we travel we make a point of finding and trying the Asian fare. This resto did not disappoint. We've been twice! The menu has about 5 combinations of meals, most made with their signature pulled noodles made fresh (in the window). Both the the beef soup and the pork are very, very good, and moreso the spicy version.  Their space is a bit of a tight squeeze, but if you don't mind sitting at the counter, then you won't have to wait too long.  And I can't wrap this up without mentioning the price. $45 for a family of 4. Worth every looney!"}
{"text":"Amazing noodles.  Fantastic broth.  Loved every bite."}
{"text":"Visited Montreal last summer and we stumbled upon this joint. The beef soup was flavourful, spicy, but not too salty. We ordered the cold beef with chilli sauce for appetizer; which was surprisingly really good. Cost for both items was less than $20, we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Though it is a small place and looks like a fast food, the shop offers first rate beef noodles in authentic Chinese style in North America. There is a similar shop in the same Chinatown, but not as good as this one. The separate cold dish of beef is also very good, no msg added (yes, I can easily taste it, and the other noodle shop uses msg)--that's the fundamental difference between fast and non-fast Chinese food."}
{"text":"Les nouilles sont excellentes, très bon bouillon aussi. Le format des soupes est assez grand. Pas assez de garnitures dans la soupe à part les nouilles. Mon copain n'a vraiment pas aimé par contre."}
{"text":"Really authentic Chinese Ramen just like what it is in China. The noodles are freshly hand made and there are many different types of noodles to choose. The quantity is big so normally the small size is enough."}
{"text":"Great food! We had the za jian mien and beef noodle soup and believe me when I say unless you have a huge appetite, one bowl was enough for two ppl! The hand pulled noodles had good nite to it and the sauce was delish. The appetizers were also very good, had the pickled cucumber and the sliced beef not too spicy either. The place is super small and gets packed quick, you most likely will be rubbing elbows with strangers, but the food is good and the service friendly !"}
{"text":"Delicious noodles. I tried the DanDan - noodles, spicy beef, nuts ... very good."}
{"text":"Excellent (but very small saloon) chinese restaurant for chinese pasta. Feels very authentic."}
{"text":"Tried this place as my group was touring Montreal for a few days from Toronto. Our group was all Chinese, with local Chinese Torontonians and a few Shanghainese. The place was very busy for lunch as the location is good. It is only a short walk from old Montreal and located on the Main Street of Montreal Chinatown. The service is relatively good, but the food is just ok. There is really nothing so memorable. The noodles are truly hand pulled, with the noodle maker making noodles in the front window. The soup itself is ok but nothing so great. As a comparison, the Vietnamese pho shops generally have better quality broths and tastier noodle soups. The prices are around CAD$10 for a large bowl. When I return to Montreal next time, I will try other places as this one was not memorable."}
{"text":"My son and I first visited Montreal,this restaurant is very good,next times we will to eat this noodles."}
{"text":"This place does one thing and does it perfectly. The handpulled noodles are incredible and perfect every time. You get options from thin, medium, or thick for round or flat. I love handpulled flat noodles and this is the only place that does them well. Don't get the thick flat noodles though. They end up being ridiculously large and impossible to eat. The broth is always hot and flavourful, full of herbs and seasonings (but the light kind of beef broth, not the heavy dark kind) and the beef is yummy and well-marinated. The small is a slightly large portion of food for the average person. The medium is a very large portion of food that will be more than enough for almost everyone. The large is a bowl as larger as most salad mixing bowls and essentially comes with a little shovel instead of a spoon. If you're not a person who finishes the soup its more manageable, but still. Always add the tea egg, no question. The appetizer/side dishes are good but not worth it cost wise, plus you won't need the additional food.   I always end up spending around $10 here. Don't bother coming if you're vegetarian. The vegetables they use are frozen and of poor quality and the broth is not comparable to the regular."}
{"text":"I traveled through Lanzhou about 15 years ago, and fondly remember the noodle dishes there. So imagine my joy and surprised when we stumbled on this place during a vacation in Montreal. AMAZING! It's so much fun to watch them make the noodles and they're just amazing. I wanted to go back a few more times but my mean husband insisted we try new places. The broth was delightful and flavorful, the noodles had a great texture, and the price was great. The service wasn't great, but who cares. It was great!"}
{"text":"Noodles are perfect and made fresh to order. Broth is very salty but has a nice kick of chilli oil. Portions are huge while the prices are low. Would definitely come back but would most likely order a small bowl instead... Medium bowl filled me up and I ain't a small dude.  Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"We wrapped up our trip with the awesome food here. I'm a vegetarian and the vegetable soup was excellent. My husband got the Zha Jiang Mian and said it was awesome. I enjoyed watching the noodles being made. Very good price as well."}
{"text":"This is a rare find noodle house, situated in montreal chinatown. They only offer 3 types of noodle soups on their menu, with the most popular choice being the lanzhou lamian. It is a very traditional bowl of rich, clear beef broth with a mix of cilantro, beef flanks and white radish. Noodles are hand-pulled. You can choose the noodle thickness as well as spiciness. Overall its a very flavorful noodle bowel. No msg. Great value. Quick service."}
{"text":"Excellent. Petit carte gage de produit frais. Les pates sont préparées sur place."}
{"text":"I was craving soup and found this place while walking through Chinatown. It gets very crowed because the space is small and cramped. We were seated almost immediately, but we had to share a table with another couple. I ordered the medium spicy beef noodle soup with jo ye noodles and my husband got the non-spicy beef noodle soup. The medium is huge, but that didn't stop me from eating it all. Service was quick and you pay on your way out. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"this place Flank noodle is tasty ?but only available Saturday and sunday."}
{"text":"It's an unassuming little spot above a Chinese super market. We tried two types of noodles (the famous Lan Zhou soupy noodle and the black bean paste Zha Jiang noodles) and they are both extremely authentic and delicious!!! The noodles are all freshly made and you can taste the freshness in every bite when your teeth get in contact with the noodles. If you are not familiar with Chinese food, give a try! The taste is so universally good and you won't disappoint! Highly recommended to everyone!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent noodle bowl.  Hand-made noodles, super good -- you can choose from 6 size/shape options.  Broth is legit.  The beef noodle soup was pretty good, but the sliced beef was just a little unsatisfying -- would have preferred brisket-stlye which would have been a little more tender.  Tendon looked good but I didn't try it.  They also had a Dan Dan style bowl which was super yum, would definitely go back for that next time.    A little cramped, but the staff was quite pleasant.  I could see this place being a long wait if you hit it at the wrong time.    All-in-all, a good solid bowl.  You should go."}
{"text":"No words can describe how great their noodles are. I've been to many countries and tried different food but this place cannot be beat! When I ordered, I had a chili paste next to me ready to mix to creat my own cuz let's be real, most places their noodles are either salty or too blend. One bite from their soup.. EVERYTHING is perfectly blend. The shop is really small but who cares when the food is delicious. Their noodle bowl are Huge. If u order a large and finishes it, consider your self a professional foodie. Best food place in Chinatown. It's a must eat place. I will cross the border and go back all the way to Montreal just to eat in that place."}
{"text":"The service was quick and courteous despite the small restaurant being quite busy. The noodles were delicious, and both of the differing broths were quite good. It was nearly impossible to get a glass of water. Overall, if we were locals, we would eat here once a week."}
{"text":"Dear fellow food lovers,   I totally agree with you guys, this place is really good and they are VERY generous on their portions. I took the combo with the beef noodle soup. The soup was good with fresh noodles & ingredients. Served quickly. Definitely one of the best soup noodle places in Montreal.  The place is small so during peak hours it will be full.   Until the next meal... salutation"}
{"text":"I've been relying on Yelp to make dining, tailoring, barber, and just about any consumer choice for a while now, and it's about time I started pulling my weight and providing reviews. So here goes my first review.  This is an awesome Chinese place in the Chinatown district in Montreal.  It may seem like a tourist trap that the place has a guy who hand rolls noodles in the front window, but the food (and the guy) is for real.  I went there for lunch with my girlfriend on Valentine's Day (I know, I'm a true romantic). It was freezing outside but the place was still pretty full.  There aren't a lot of seats inside, but diners turn over quick, so getting a spot was not hard.  When I sat down, the servers immediately brought a super hot yet very welcome tea.  I ordered a medium spicy beef tendon noodle, and it was delicious.  The broth was rich and flavorful, and though the beef at times was a little gamey (it's beef tendon, so this should be expected), the rich flavor more than offset the chewy texture. And oh yes, the noodles were fantastic.    The portions are huge, and I couldn't finish off the entire bowl.  Unless you are really really hungry, a small bowl should meet most appetites just fine.  But if it's any consolation, the medium bowl only cost $10 USD.  Next time I find myself in Montreal on a cold day, I'm coming to this place."}
{"text":"Good, addictive & inexpensive Chinese Beef noodle soup.  TASTE : This Beef Noodle Soup is different from Japanese Ramen. This is more light & spicy I would say. If you like Asian noodles, you'd better try it to enlarge your taste. It worth it.  I never tried Chinese noodle in China so I don't know the original taste of Chinese Ramen but this is one of the most delicious Ramen in Montreal. Much better than other Japanese Ramens with fake tacky instant taste.  ORDER TIP : You can choose the shape of noodle(5~6) & it varies final outcome. You can also choose it to be spicy or not.  (If it is your first time & you don't fancy coriander, ask them not to put it because they put a lot then you'd expect.)"}
{"text":"Favorite noodle resto -- tiny menu / consistently fast, delicious, affordable food / good service / chill ambiance"}
{"text":"The only reason you get one star is because the food is good. HERES HOW BAD EVERYTHING ELSE WAS. I sit down put my jacket down and right away he asks me what id like to order. Ummm maybe a menu would help? Gives me and menu and says what would you like,i haven't even had a chance to flip open the menu, you just gave it to me. So he stood there awkwardly and I just ordered quickly. They say us split between two tables. So us being nice, notice it getting busy and tell them we'll squeeze into one table so they can serve other people. Well I ask for water. Food comes, one at a time, atleast ten mins apart, so by the last person, it's was all cold. Fine.. it's okay ur busy. I ask for water again. We finish eating, still no water. My dad gets up and asks for water, the guy starts pouring a glass infront of him and I'm like seriously? No we want water for the whole table my dad can't bring it all. So my dad sits and we wait. NO WATER. I ask again. The guy comes back with a pitcher.. we have no glasses. So he comes back with ONE glass of water. NO I want water for everyone. And he says: we have no glasses left and proceeded to pour the water in our tea.... I MEAN WHAT THE ACTUAL ******!!?? Sorry, just the principle, you guys are always busy so you know what to expect. It's not the waiters fault maybe they're only two or theee, So MANAGEMENT GET UR **** TOGETHER."}
{"text":"Best noodle soup in montreal. Fast and quality service, nice staff, delicious food. Also, huge portions for a good price; a small is mroe than enough. I go there almost weekly and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered the braised beef tendon noodle soup, a special served only on friday through sunday. The portion was very generous, the broth had an amazing depth to it, the beef was perfect and the noodles had a great al dente feel to it, unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Leurs soupes au buf sont délicieuses! On peut choisir la largeur des nouilles et la commander épicée ou non. Prix très abordable pour la portion et réconfortante :-)"}
{"text":"Side dishes here are excellent. You get to choose from the three choices of noodles in the menu - I tried the Dry Noodle dish - comes with flat noodles topped with spicy pork, edamame, sliced cucumber and carrots along with some steamed bok choy. Mix it up, top that mixture with some hot oil and you are in for a treat.  Warning: You better get a big bottle of water when you order this - makes you extremely parched/ thirsty even hours after you are done."}
{"text":"We were initially heading for Jardin Nelson but instead found ourselves mesmerized window watching how the noodles were made. We decided to go in for a hot bowl of spicy beef noodles instead on this chilly Canadian night. The place is very small so we had to wait about 5-10 minutes to get seats. You order the size (small, medium, large), how thin or thick you want your noodles and spicy or not spicy. It's a fast turnover place so food came quickly. The small bowl came with an abundance of noodles (which I love) and was more than enough for me! Food was great! Noodles were freshly made. Price was very reasonable. My husband and I ate dinner for less than $20."}
{"text":"Very limited menu but the food is tasty and authentic.  Definitely give it a try and order the cucumbers."}
{"text":"Good authentic lan Zhou noodles with Very generous serving size. Busy at night time but qeue goes relatively quickly and service is prompt. Served my Chinese craving while travelling"}
{"text":"I went here two days in a row and got the same thing cause I liked it so much. First, it's the very definition of tiny hole in the wall. You sit elbow to elbow next to other people slurping up some of the best soup to be had in Montreal like happy little pigs at the trough. They sit you down on a tiny rickety wood table perched above an escalator leading down to the grocery story below. There's no place to put your winter coat or bag so you sorta stay fully dressed but it's fine cause it's so good you don't talk, you just eat fast. They serve you up this horrible tea (to be fair, I'm not a tea person, I usually only get chamomile). The tea, 'cleanses the palate' by erasing all memories of good tasting food, and starts you off low so the soup tastes like the best thing you've ever had. I ordered the dan dan bowl with the fattest noodles BOTH TIMES (you can choose the noodle size). The noodles were doughy and perfect.  Then, when they bring it out, it comes in this bowl larger than your head, slippery plastic chop sticks and a small ladle to eat/drink/slurp it with. It's nearly impossible to pick up the noodles and then keep them on the chopsticks long enough to funnel them into your mouth - a humbling challenge to say the least. Oh but the food is so good it's worth the abuse of the crammed seating, cold winter air coming in every time the door opens, and inadequate eating utensils. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yummy Noodle Soups. I got the medium soup think it was decent sized but it was HUGE! So yummy though!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, great price and awesome noodles, what more could I ask for ?      This place reminds me of the Lan Zhou noodles i used to have in China as a kid. it's really authentic and the portions are huge ! ( I ordered a small and it was honestly more than enough) They only have a few things on the menu so if you're not into noodles, this is definitely not the place for you. As for the noodles, they have several option for the size and shape of the noodles, as well as the spiciness.     Highly recommend the place & will definitely be returning !"}
{"text":"I had the cold noodle bowl but also tasted the beef noodle soup and the cucumber dish. Liked all of them. The noodle is the best of all the ingredients. The sliced beef is only okay to me. I wish they were stewed beef chucks. At the catchier, you may be asked whether you would include tips in the check. You'd want to tell the waiter/waitress the amount of tip you wish to give to avoid a surprise that you may not accustomed to."}
{"text":"Les soupes sont succulentes, vraiment très bonnes, goûteuses. Une des meilleures soupes asiatique que j'ai pu goûter. L'endroit est petit souvent pas très confortable mais disons que ça fait partie de l'expérience et on fait avec. La communauté chinoise est bien représentée comme clientèle et c'est bon signe. J'y retournerai certainement."}
{"text":"PROS  - Good service (Français and English) - Soup bowls are full of fresh veggies - Take-out bowls are microwave safe - Huge portions and not expensive at all  CONS  - A bit too salty - Noodles have a very ''floury'' texture and taste - Bathroom is very far"}
{"text":"I just revised this review since I went back and found out that the name given is Yuki Ramen, though the Chinese name is Lan Zhou La Mien.  This is the second restaurant in Montreal that has a Japanese based name as it's Westernized name, that doesn't really correspond with the Chinese name at all.  The other is Kanbai on Ste. Catherine.  The rest of the review is the same.    Very inexpensive but very good HANDMADE NOODLES.  There are offered without soup mixed with some sort of sauce.    We had:  1.  RED COOKED BEEF SHANK:  This is a very traditional dish made with different spices, soy sauce, and a pork/chicken broth that is suite and rich.  Their name was anglicized and frankified, so I don't remember what they called it.  The broth was great. The meet was not cooked as long as it should, so it didn't have the tenderness that this dish normally has.  But it was tasty and the fresh pulled hand made noodles were delightful.  2.  PORK WITH PICKLED VEGETABLES: T his is a traditional chinese dish too.  The broth is oilier, but delightful and the flavors were rich and good.  A little bit of spiciness, but not much.   3.  WONTON NOODLES:  The kids had this.  The broth was more delicate and good.  4.  SPICY COLD PIG EARS:  I know.  Sounds gross.  Eh?  Delicious.  Spicy in the Schichuan style with hot and tingly or \"mala\" spicing.    NEXT TIME:  Want to dry the noodles with beef-dza jia mien.  My wife makes this and it's wonderful.  Want to try it.    BADS:  Waitress was kind of disintrested.  No decor at all.    INFORMATION:  1.  I don't know the English name of this restaurant. 2.  I don't know the exact address, but it's near Epicerie Lam Kee just to the sounth.  3.  Lan zhou noodles are normally made with a kind of naturally occuring chemical used in Japanese and Chinese noodles sometimes called \"kansui\".  I don't know if they used it here, since it usually imparts a yellowish color to the noodle, and these were very white.   4.  In New York, I would give this a slightly lower rating.  This was a joint rating by me and my Chinese wife.  We thought about 1/2 to 1 star lower for Manhattan."}
{"text":"This small restaurant can get line ups going out the door, my friends and I were lucky enough to get a table right when we stepped foot inside. You can see the noodles being hand-pulled right in front of your eyes from the store front window.  Food: Got their Braised beef tendon with noodles ($10.99). The thickness of noodles can be changed. The soup was clear and simple, my tongue could not detect a distinct flavour but the chilli oil did add some taste. The highlights of the bowl was the noodles, radish slices and tender melt-in-your-mouth beef tendons.   Service & atmosphere: Seating is slightly cramped but that just adds authenticity to the shop. The entrance of an underground asian market is housed inside the restaurant so after you are full from your noodles, you Jocan walk it off in the market.  Price: I am sure you can get this bowl of noodles from China for a cheaper price. However, the price is fair as it is the only hand-pulled noodle shop in Montreal that I know of."}
{"text":"Wow!  Nothing like eating fresh handmade noodles!  Even better is being able to watch your noodles being made!  It was so magical watching the chef stretch, pull, and cut the noodles with ease.  Everyone in my party ranted and raved about the \"spot on\" al dente texture of our noodles.  The perfectly crafted noodles that I had ordered were about the size of tagliatelle pasta.  Broth was served on the side to cut through the sweet, pungent hoisin based sauce served on the noodles. You could order three different sizes depending on the size of your appetite.  I ordered a medium.  It was so good that I almost ate it all, yet I was amazed that I didn't have that greasy, salty stuffed-up feeling in my stomach that I sometimes get at certain Chinese food restaurants.    If you drink your broth, you might be okay with the small.  I'm on a low-sodium diet so I tend to avoid drinking the broth.  Also, a side note--someone ordered the vegetarian noodles and was surprised that the broth was a curry based one.  She loved it, though and said it was one of the best broths that she's had.  I'm not sure if she just didn't read the menu well or if it wasn't specifically noted.    Anyway, the place was packed (try not to take your shopping bags with you because things are cramped here) so I am not the only one thinking that this place is awesome.  I will definitely return to Nouilles de Lan Zhou (so good that I have the name memorized) when visiting Montreal again.  No credit cards.  Prices were reasonable. I think it was cash only."}
{"text":"Very authentic handcraft traditional Chinese noodles!  Nice, clean environment and good service.  Overall, so impressive!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! I've tried all 3 \"salad\" dishes (edamame, spicy cucumber and seaweed potatoes) and of course the amazing beef soup. They even let you choose which size noodles you want. The soup is extremely flavorful and if you like spicy food they have a type of chili oil you can add to it which gives it a wonderful spice. The noodles are handmade and the price is right. Definitely a great pick if ever you're in the Chinatown area and are craving a good soup. The small is a perfect size, and the medium is good if you have a bigger appetite or are starving.  My girlfriend tried the vegetable version of the soup and said the broth tasted a little bit saltier, but still very good."}
{"text":"The noodles come in large portions. The medium can feed two. The beef noodle was delicious. The noodle was right texture, the soup was full of flavor. The special also comes with a side. The cucumber salad was also very good.  This is a fast and cheap eat. Would come back again."}
{"text":"pretty good hand strung noodle with good broth, the service is pretty fast during lunch time too. they have different thickness of noodle that you can choose from and they also have a variety of appetizers"}
{"text":"I tried the new cold noodle but didn't enjoy it due to sauce tasted like mayonnaise than typical peanut sauce.   My husband had the noodle with meat sauce and was way too salty.   Place is nice and clean and staffs are friendly but food was ok."}
{"text":"Needed to have some Asian after several meals of sandwiches, smoked meat, potatoes etc. so decided to stop by this place in Chinatown.  The noodles were definitely tasty!  The food is so good the place was packed.  Granted, it's a very small place (almost looked like they set up shop in the lobby of a small building) but because the place is always busy the service speed was very fast - you were literally in and out in half an hour.  I can't really say more than that the noodles were pretty authentic, but it wasn't as spicy as what's typical of Lan Zhou noodles."}
{"text":"A couple from Ottawa recommended this place. OMG. Their noodles n soup is just... Amazing! It's super affordable and satisfying. For a small girl like me, size SMALL will fill u up n it only costs like $7! If u haven't had any good noodles, please go to this one!! Having tried different Chinese noodles, This is like the best one."}
{"text":"Tasty, cheap and healthy Chinese eats. Great vegetarian options. The portions are very generous by the way; I wasn't able to finish all my noodles but the food was well worth it regardless. Cozy place too!"}
{"text":"This is a fun,cramped, tasty place to grab a quick lunch (if there is no line!). I really don't know much about noodles, but I do know when they are good. These are good. There is a guy in the window making them to order. It does not get any fresher than this.  I had the beef with noodles (medium bowl is huge). The broth and noodles were good, I thought the meat was way overcooked and dry. Nothing special to eat at all.  My wife had the noodles with vegetables. This is a better dish. The noodles were \"eggier\" and thin. The Broccoli was great.  I also had the spicy cucumber salad. VERY GOOD! Not super spicy so go for it!  The place is tiny, and you sit on a little bench. It is not the place for relaxing. You get in, get a seat, eat and leave!!  Sodas are served in the can. Water is sparse, you have to keep asking for refills if you are thirsty.  Great little stop in Chinatown, right in the heart of the area."}
{"text":"Hugely overrated. The place smells very promising as you step in, but quickly gives way to disappointment once you tuck into the food.   Had the standard beef noodles. Broth was pretty weak by Chinese standards, which I felt condemned the dish for me. Noodles and meat cooked ok but certain bits of the noodles were not pulled properly and ended up being clumped together.   At $10 after tax and tips for the smallest portion, I feel it is a tad too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing! Fresh noodles made on the spot. Perfect broth balance. Can't wait to come back. Totally addictive from the first bite of al dente noodles."}
{"text":"The dinning area is very tiny, can not eat comfortable. The food is a bit pricy. Not delicious, not authentic."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant in chinatown. They make their own noodles and let me tell you, they are AMAZING !!! I took the beef soup, the broth was very simple and light, just the way I like it. It goes perfectly with the huge amount of noodles they give !!  The portions are very big. I took a medium sized soup and it was pretty huge (I finished it though because it was sooo good!!)  I can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"This place was the perfect stop on a blistering New Year's Day! The noodles were perfectly al dente, the broth was nice and clean although I don't think their spicy is actually spicy. We ordered the Special Beef, Beef appetizer, pickled cucumbers and edamame - we needed to add some soy to the dishes for flavoring but otherwise everything was cooked well. The restaurant is cozy and the servers are quick and friendly. I like that there is a grocery store downstairs so you could shop while waiting to be seated. Who doesn't love a good bowl of steaming hot noodle soup with -35 windchills outside."}
{"text":"They only have 1 choice of soup, and it is excellent Lan Zhou style beef noodle soup.  You can ask them for no spice if you don't like spicy food, the base beef stock is still flavorful without extra spice.  Though try adding a little spice to your threshold level (maybe for your last few bites) for a more complete experience. They also offer a customer's choice for noodle type/thickness.  My personal favorite is the ultra-thin noodle, because they're soft and absorb the soup so well.  Though you can also go for big inches-wide chewy flat noodle and anything in between.    The portion is larger than you'd normally see in Montreal.  Their small is most people's normal size, so get small for solo, or get a medium/large to share.  If you always complain that other places don't give enough, you're going to leave happy from here.  It's worth the wait if the line doesn't go beyond the entrance.  Price, quality, quantity are all on-point.  Is it as good as eating it in Lan Zho, China?  No.  But this is plenty good enough to have a taste in Montreal."}
{"text":"Expect big bowls of Beef Noodle Soup and line ups here! This tiny stall only has 10 tables and some counter style seating. Their specialty is Szechwan style hand pulled noodles. You can watch the Master make strands of fresh noodles in just seconds. Just a few options on the menu. You choose beef brisket or thinly sliced beef shank, your size of noodles and if you would love like your soup base spicy or non-spicy. The soup is flavourful & aromatic with chilli oil, green onions, and hint of Cumin & Five Spice. The noodles have great texture and the perfect bounce. Can't go wrong with a bowl of noodles here."}
{"text":"Excellent soup, yes there is only one choice \"beef broth\" but who needs more. Their small size is pretty generous. We went with our 6 years old son and were a little worried about the lack of options but to our surprise he liked it so much he said \"I wish I could swim in this soup\" followed by \" can we come back here next time we come to Canada?\". I ordered their noodles in their smallest version, my husband ordered their recommended size (medium), I will stick with the smaller version, they are just more fun to eat!!!"}
{"text":"The cutest little noodle shop that I'll never stop recommending to anyone who comes to Montreal! Definitely one of the spots you have to go to if you have a few days in the city.   I'll come to this place once every few months, and I've never been disappointed. There's almost always a line during meal times unless you get lucky, but service is fast, friendly, and endearing. There aren't that many tables since the restaurant is located above a supermarket, but the noodles come in 5-10 minutes, so the turnover time is pretty fast.  The portions are huge, and the prices are super reasonable. Honestly, I love everything about their noodles. I've tried most things on the menu, but my personal favourite is the zha jiang mian, which comes with a small soup on the side. For me, half a medium-sized portion is already super filling. My tip: always order the tea egg (or two) for $0.99 each."}
{"text":"In my honest opinion, the one located in Eaton Centre near McGill University (Nudo) is much better than this one. I mean, this is supposed to be your main store, but how can it be so much worse than the one in Eaton Centre?  The pork ears I had were actually dry, meaning that they were prepared days before and wasn't served and not properly stored either. The noodles are not hot when served, and they were to undercooked for a La Mian (). They were not \"Al dente\", they were UNDERCOOKED...my jaws went sore from the chewing I had to do to eat those \"noodles\". The soup was just bland, and had nothing special in it.  The service was not what I had in mind; my water was never filled, and the waitress never came either."}
{"text":"I love Yelp!  I never would have found this place without them.  With my hotel being just a short walk away from here in Montreal, I decided to venture out and get some good Chinese food. One look on the Yelp app and I found this place...it was very highly rated.  It was wonderful to be able to sit at the bar and watch your noodles get made from scratch. The soup was great and it doesn't get any fresher than this. Also loved the cucumber salad come up but beware if you don't like spicy food, it has a little kick to it.  Definitely give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"The noodle soup here is legit.    Broth is delicious.  Well seasoned, not overly salty. You can ask them for non-spicy or mildly spicy broth.    Noodles were amazing!  Had a good chew and texture.  I tried two types- flat and round- and both were well prepared and cooked.  Great portions.  I got the beef tendon noodle soup for around $12 or $13.  Got a really good amount of beef and beef tendon. It would be the perfect dish to share (tho I'm not sure if they'd allow two people to eat one bowl).    Highly recommended! Wish this place was in Manhattan."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to go to on the way to G&D (my favorite grocery store in Chinatown), especially if it's snowing out and you're REALLY hungry.   Portion sizes are huge, I would recommend getting a small portion pretty much no matter what. I got the beef tendon soup, which was huge for the price of $10.99++, and I couldn't even finish it! Beef was really good and tender, and the soup was super tasty. The noodles were well made, good amount of chewiness, but I didn't manage to finish them. Nothing was really super special about this restaurant, but I could see myself coming here if I was nearby.  I can appreciate the authenticity of this restaurant, brings me back to Asia, for sure. Its also cool to see groceries coming straight from downstairs to be used in the restaurant! Confirms that everything's fresh :)"}
{"text":"Handmade noodles in a wonderful beef broth. Sliced beef shanks on top with scallions.  Ordering is simple, first you choose what size bowl you want. I was famished and went with the large. Be warned, I highly recommend that you stick to the medium because the large size was gigantic. You can also choose what thickness you want your noodles to be.  There are a few appetizer options: spicy cucumber, pickled cabbage, marinated eggs.  I went with the spicy cucumber since it was hot outside and wanted to whet my appetite even more.  It reminded me of my travels in Asia where I would walk into a small noodle shack and sit down at the bar and watch the chef make the food in front of me.  Simple, honest and great noodles. What more does a hungry man need?"}
{"text":"This was my family and I's first stop in Montreal. We were completely famished since we boarded our plane at 640 AM in the morning from New York. So when we got to Montreal and saw nearby restaurants we just had to stop here! Apparently Montreal offers amazing Chinese food and Nouilles de Lan Zhou DID NOT disappoint!    We each got one of the noodles except for the chef recommendation because they weren't serving it that day. The noodles came and they were heavenly! The broth was cooked very well and it wasn't too salty or spicy like other noodle houses.   My nieces enjoyed their vegetarian noodle dish especially the edamame side dish! Definitely recommending this place to any of my friends who decide to visit Montreal! :)"}
{"text":"I don't understand how I've not heard of this place! I have heard of it as the noodle place with the supermarket downstairs but you should all remember that it's called LAN ZHOU. They have delicious asian noodles with an assortment of different noodle thickness and shape of the noodle. I would go for the small if you're not too hungry. If you're starving you should get the medium. Their sizes are humongous and remember that it's noodles in soup as well and soup really fills you up! Their spicy is a little bit too spicy for my liking but these noodles will turn your sad day upside down. You can also watch the employees make noodle by the window at the front or inside. It's pretty mesmerizing watching them make the noodles. Don't come in a group of more than 4 since there isn't that much seating."}
{"text":"If you're hungry, Go here. Hand made, so fresh. A bit crowded, but the noodles are amazing. If you have a peanut allergy, either skip this place altogether or bring an epi pen and enjoy some tasty noodles before getting rushed to the hospital."}
{"text":"The noodles were very big (good for the price). They were also very tasty. I enjoyed my meal a lot, but I wish the noodles were cooked a little more"}
{"text":"This is one of those rare places that really lives up to the the reviews. The noodles were incredibly fresh, tender, flavorful, etc, and were a genuine highlight of my trip to Montreal. The pickles were also delicious and a nice complement to the meatiness of the main beef dish. The service was friendly and helpful; they guided me towards the right noodle thickness, and I liked their suggestion."}
{"text":"Honestly a group of friends and I were walking around on vacation and were looking for a good place to eat. When we stumbled upon this tiny noodle house, we weren't expecting the food and hospitality that we got. The place was packed and every table was taken. The bowls were incredibly filling and the noodles were amazing! The atmosphere of the place was so warming and great for the day. I would honestly recommend this place to anyone and hope to come back here some day!"}
{"text":"Beef noodles great, service is variable. One or two of their male servers are snobbish. When I came with my mom she also noticed they seem to have preferential treatment of some of the older Chinese clientelle. I asked her but she is sure it was no accident. We are Taiwanese btw, and we speak and understand Mandarin.  Avoid the vegetarian noodles. Really bad.  Dandan noodles were good. Special beef noodles were meh."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious bowl if noidles with beef, great flavor and value. Ordered a medium and took 1/2 home.  Would return to sample other items if i lived here.  Highly recommend for food- don't go for ambience or service -just amazing food"}
{"text":"My partner and I found the noodles were good. We were just disappointed we didn't order the thicker noodle. The waiter didn't offer, they basically just took our order and assumed that we wanted the regular noodle If we didn't  ask. You definitely have to know your noodles before you ordered. The noodle came out pretty quick and  was very good . Will come back again and definitely order the thicker noodles :D"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. Sooooo good.. I'm a big-eater (don't let my small frame deceive you, I can out-eat most grown adult men lol) and the portion sizes are HUGE!  I had a medium combo that comes with the a bowl of beef noodles, a side dish salad, and a tea egg, and I was full!  The beef noodles are some of the best that I've had.. I've lived in California, New York & traveled to Asia, and this restaurant is up there with regards to the yumminess.  Check it out if you're up here!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The noodles are freshly made and the broth is just insanely good. I would go back everyday if I could. My boyfriend got the vegetarian option and it was really good also!"}
{"text":"Authentic! I can proudly say that as Chinese. It's very fulfilling as the broth is flavorful but not overly rich. The noodles are super fresh and cooked just to the right tenderness. HUGE servings, so you might wanna clear up some space in the stomach before going. The beef stew soup noodle I'd amazing, but only available on the weekend I think. All taste pretty good though! One of the very few authentic taste of China in town. Place is aways crowded as it isn't big. Go early for lunch if you don't want to wait in line."}
{"text":"Not too impress.  Noodles are hard and uncook, not worth the wait. Space is small and no bathroom.  You have to go to 6th fl to use bathroom from other rest.  Not going back again."}
{"text":"Leckerer kleiner Laden. Es gibt nicht viel auf der Karte, aber was es gab war sehr lecker. Suppe kostete 7,99 CAD und war in Größe S völlig ausreichend. Man konnte auswählen wie dick die Nudeln sein sollten. War top  Selbst Tee gab es umsonst"}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy. Not quite BEIJING standard, but a definite must have for a foodie visit to Montreal China town"}
{"text":"Best noodles ever!  Make sure to stop in and experience the soup. Add extra beef and ask for it spicy!  The spicy cucumber salad and edamame is fantastic!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fresh Noodles & spicy soup! It was good. We ordered small & it was perfect sized 'cause we wanted  to go around the corner for a sesame dessert. Be sure to go downstairs to the small Chinese grocery to have a look around!"}
{"text":"Great Noodle place, fresh made noodles right in front of your eyes. Its fun just to watch them make the noodles. The restaurant is very small, so it can get very busy. But it is definitely worth the wait. I would have given 5 stars but they gave a large instead of a Med. Which turned out to be good as the food was delicious. But its the principal that they got the order wrong. Either way, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very good - broth was a little on the salty side and lacked the complexity of flavor for five stars. But the service was good, and the the noodles were overall awesome. Atmosphere good!"}
{"text":"Fresh made noodles served with really tasty broth. Generous portions and pretty inexpensive. Great value for money. You might have to wait in line for a spot though, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Try if you've never been, but if you've had beef noodle soup from Asia before, this place isn't worth a second visit.  MSG soup! Maybe it's my hyper sensitivity to MSG, but I was thirsty for at least two hours after having their signature beef noodles.   I ordered the thick noodles. Noodles were a bit undercooked and lacked elastic texture that you'd expect from handmade Chinese noodles. The beef was a bit dry.  The soup base is not made from beef; it tastes like a concentrate based stock flavored with lots of MSG and pepper oil. I'd expect something like this from a street vendor in China except this was 10x the cost."}
{"text":"Cheap and super filling. Hand pulled noodles are cooked to order and you get your food quickly. Delicious, though if you go all you're getting is noodles. So don't expect anything else."}
{"text":"You have three choices: beef noodle soup, veggie noodle soup, and zhajiang mian (dry noodles with veggies, bean curd paste, and meat). I had the beef noodle soup and my wife had the zhajiang mian. Both were really good. The cucumber appetizer was excellent - the oil was spicy and the peanuts made a great contrast.   Equal to any noodles we had during our five years in China. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The hand pulled noodles were superb! I just wish the soup was a little more flavorful. This place needs AC or lot more fans..I was sweating like crazy. I couldn't get the famous beef tendon noodles, it was only available on the weekends. But I ordered a small beef noodle and it was more than enough. My brother who usually eats a lot couldn't finish his medium. Street parking only. You have to go downstairs and to the second floor for the washrooms."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my noodles, but be aware that the menu is only about six choices, and the place is really tiny with only a few tables.  In my case, I sat on a low stool at a counter, facing a blank wall.  People navigating to a place of their own jostled me repeatedly.  A little like being in food prison.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Portions here are HUGE!!! I split a medium bowl with my sister and it was plenty of food for the both of us. We came here on a snowy winter night and were seated immediately however shortly after there was a wait as the seating is pretty limited.   You can see the kitchen from the dining area and the kitchen also faces the street so you can watch them work from the outside. Noodles are hand drawn, made to order which is always delightful to watch!    The place is cozy and right above an Asian supermarket so it's not immediately apparent. But it's definitely worth the wait and the price is most certainly right! After we were seated the food came quickly as well. Credit cards are not accepted-- only debit and cash.  I would definitely come again the next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The crowds gathered around the window are the first sign of something special. Inside are artists (noodle pullers?!) who start with balls of dough and a few minutes later, twisting and turning, create sumptuous noodles.   It's tiny and there's a line to get in at lunch, but the line moves fast. After being seated at a table with a quiet Chinese couple I realized that the tiny restaurant overlooks the foyer of a grocery store!  Grocery shoppers provide some people watching to accompany the meal.    The specialty is beef noodle soup. It's warm, soothing, and satisfying. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The noodles and broth were top notch. I wouldn't mind if the beef was a little less grisly (maybe I am a stupid American).  The soup was less greasy than similar soups I've had around Boston n  The portions are actually obscene, especially since hand pulled noodles are very filling. I had a medium soup and was unable to finish it.   Had the house soup and plan to return next year to try others.   The place is a little dingy and cramped, thus only 4 stars."}
{"text":"Order the traditional La Mein bowl medium size with a table of 4 during lunch hour.Great price, and minimal wait time. 2 issues - broth was a bit too salty and there were some noodles pieces that weren't properly quicked. No other problems!"}
{"text":"Wow! I think this may have been the best noodles I've tasted in a long time. The noodles are hand pulled right in the store. You can choose the size and shape of the noodle (thin, thick, flat, etc). I wasn't able to taste MSG in the soup, which is a plus. The noodle bowl just had the right balance of meat, carb, and vegetables to make it a satifying and delicious meal.  The service was prompt and the interior was clean. I think all quick serve Chinese places should aim for what this place has achieved. This noodle joint is definitely worth a detour to Chinatown!"}
{"text":"We ate here while visiting Montreal.  We were walking by and the guy making fresh noodles in the window caught our eye.  We decided to stop and eat.  Amazing! Can't get noddles fresher than this! Broth was yummy, meat was tender, juicy, and delish!"}
{"text":"J'ai goûté aux nouilles Dan Dan et à la soupe au buf. Nous avons aussi commandé les concombres épicés et les edamame et j'ai vraiment tout aimé. Le bouillon de la soupe est léger et savoureux, la viande est assez tendre et les nouilles excellentes. Vaut mieux commander les petits formats à moins d'avoir un gros appétit et de manger rapidement sinon les nouilles absorbent trop de bouillon et deviennent pâteuses. J'ai adoré le Dan Dan! Pas trop piquant une bonne dose de poivre de Sechuan qui engourdi la langue (in a good way). La saveur de la viande est délicieuse et pas trop grasse. Le bok choy apporte la touche fraîche et croustillante pour équilibrer le tout. Prenez les nouilles traditionnelles pour un plat qui frise la perfection.  Ce que j'ai moins aimé est l'emplacement au dessus de l'épicerie. Il fait plutôt froid (les portes sont grande ouvertes) et on est pas très à l'aise. On se sent pressé de partir avec le regard suppliant des gens qui attendent une place en grelottant. Autrement, j'aurais donné la note parfaite...."}
{"text":"Excellent noodle soup.  First class broth.  Full meal in a small soup for about $10.00 at time of review. Choice of homemade noodle. Cozy.   Be prepared to share table. Real street eats. Limited menu. Recomended. Went back for small soup as usual.  Kitchen error, they made a large.  Size of a small hub cap.  No problem, just charged for small.  But I was sitting alone at the very front.  Everyone  walking by looked at the size then looked at me in disgust.  Finally, with one woman I said, I ordered the small.  She gasped, that's a small!! Yes, I said. Lol."}
{"text":"The best noodle house in Montreal! I am from Pennsylvania (USA) and it's hard to find noodles this good in some parts of NYC! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Pros: Superb bowl of hand stretch noodle. Good broth, fresh products, fast service, very clean establishment. Complimentary tea is served trough the sitting.    Cons: Very few menu item, some only available on weekend. No washroom are easily accessible and the table are very small, like the restaurant. It gets crowded easily.  If you want to slurp up a good bowl of noodle and don't mine XS tables. This is for you!"}
{"text":"Delicious noodle bowls can be found here!  We were looking for a quick, tasty lunch in Chinatown and we were so happy we stopped here.   The place was packed - always a good sign - but we were seated promptly by friendly staff. The app was presented right away (spicy cucumber salad - yum!). The noodles were brought out in less that ten minutes. Steaming hot, amazing noodles and so filling! Huge portions (a small is more than enough) packing a flavour punch. It was also fun to watch the chef making the noodles from where we sat. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Since I first reviewed, they've introduced other types of soups, including a vegetarian option, and you can now choose the type of noodles, ranging from fine round to large flat, with several options in-between. And they serve free tea."}
{"text":"Wow! I don't have too much to say other than this soup really hit the spot!   So inexpensive and such astounding quality! The homemade noodles are like nothing else. Is there any other way to eat soup?!?!  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Delicious! You can pick the size of your noodles and you can see the guys making them while you wait (about 10 mins on a Sunday evening).  The seating was really awkward. My boyfriend and I had to share with another couple... and that really lessened the experience. We couldn't hold a conversation comfortably because they were sitting at the same table with us.   The food was good... Big portions and great price! BUTTTT the service was mediocre."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far, and wish I had more chances to go. The food is amazing: the broth is very well seasoned, the noodles are chewy, and the portion is huge. I am stuffed with a medium bowl no matter how hungry I was. You can add spicy oil as much as you'd like. Love their tea eggs too. The only thing is that the place is extremely small, so there is often a wait, but it shouldn't be too long. Overall would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The noodles are super fresh, soups are great and service is lightning quick. It is a little bit small, so dont expect to seat a group.   Friendly tip: take a smaller portions. Their bowls are HUGE"}
{"text":"I finally got around to checking this place out, and I'm glad I did. People weren't lying when they said the portions were huge! The medium bowl was more than enough for me, and I can't even imagine what the large would look like! I like that I was able choose how thick I wanted my noodles, and the service was very quick. It's in a bit of an odd location, since there's an escalator smack dab in the middle of the restaurant that leads to the grocery store downstairs. So you'll see a lot of people coming and going from there. Seating is quite limited, but it wasn't very busy when I was there, so it wasn't a problem. There's a clear view of the kitchen, which looked very clean, and you can watch them while they hand pull the noodles. The prices are good for the amount of food you get, and since it's so quick, it would make a good place for a lunch break."}
{"text":"Reminds me of NY's Xian Famous Foods. The noodles could be more toothy, but the soup is en point. The house made hot sauce (sesame, sesame oil and chilli based), is what my dreams are made of."}
{"text":"Lan Zhou-style noodles are famous in China, and you can find shops all accross the country selling this simple meal. It's usually a small joint with tiny tables and even tinier chairs. There's rarely air conditioning, and a fan is typically blowing from a corner of the dining room. Noodles MUST be fresh and handmade, if not by the owners of the restaurant, then by a noodle factory. The \"mouthfeel\" of the noodles is very important - something not unrelated from the term \"al dente\" in Italian cuisine. The rest of the dish tend to vary (broth, toppings, seasoning).   Nouilles de Lan Zhou used to only serve beef noodles, in three different bowl size, and different types of noodles (round or flat). They have since expanded their menu (e.g. cold noodles, beef tendon noodles) and added a few side dishes (e.g. edamame and pickled mustard green, spicy cucumbers). The regular beef noodles remain my favorite.  The restaurant is located in a weirdly arranged space at the entrace of the G&D supermarket, and has probably less than 30 seats. Service is fast, and the illustrated menu is helpful to make a choice. It usually goes like this: 1) choice of noodles, and if required, 2) bowl size, 3) type of noodle, and 4) spicy or not. Some noodles, such as the beef tendon noodle, only has one size (medium). Talking about size, the portions are humooongous. I don't recommend ordering anything larger than medium if you can't finish, e.g. three Big Macs.   A great place to grab a cheap and quick meal!"}
{"text":"Big lines to get into the small noodle soup place. Everything was delicious and served quickly. Prices were reasonable.  Noodle soups were very flavourable and generous size. Stick with a medium bowl unless you are very hungry."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best noodles that I've ever tasted. Definitely a must! It's a little cramped but it's soo worth it."}
{"text":"Lan Zhou Noodles was an absolute gem!  Located in the street level lobby of an underground Chinese supermarket, the only hint of the deliciousness inside from outside is the view of the chef making hand-pulled noodles.  The selection is limited but when it's forte is Chinese beef noodles in a clear broth, who needs anything else?  Having had some of the finest in Taiwan, Los Angeles, and New York, this place has then all beat.  I suggest the beef noodle special with the seaweed/daikon salad or edamame with pickled cabbage.  The only drawbacks were the limited seating (don't worry, the tables turn over quickly), lack of restrooms (use the public ones in the mall a few doors down), and lack or air conditioning.    I'm still thinking about dinner even though I'm stuffed!"}
{"text":"Ok, I don't know why everyone is so positive about this place. As other reviewers have stated the go to dish here is the Lan Zhou Noodles. There are a variety of sizes to the noodles and they are hand made. I opted for the third thinnest variety as I'm not a big fan of huge knife cut noodles. The noodles came out ok looks wise to my liking, but I was not impressed with the flavor at all. I felt like the noodles were the type that could grow exponentially in hot soup and I felt that they did grow a bit as I ate on. The soup itself was a clearer beef broth which is different from what I was used to. There is an essence of the bone there, but it's not really flavorful at all - pretty watered down in my opinion. As for the beef - it's a couple of thin slivers with no pieces of shank or stew to be substantial. I got the combo that came with the third veggie option which turned out to be a cold seaweed salad which was overly salty. I would say don't believe the hype and skip this place. It's not worth the calories."}
{"text":"I discovered this place when I attended a conference at the nearby Palais des Congres this summer - and boy - was I happy to find it! This small restaurant is hustling and bustling and serves mostly Asians - unlike many of the touristy restaurant around in Montreal's tiny Chinatown.  It's cheap, fast and hart warming since it serves mostly soups - for both vegeterians and meat lovers!  awesome lunch for the conference people!"}
{"text":"so happy to be here. the noodles are delectable as are the salads. it's no frills and scrumptious."}
{"text":"As good as Lanzhou noodle gets!! Great price and fast service. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The portions are absolutely massive and I'd definitely recommend getting the smallest size because even that is difficult to finish. The noodles are one of the best hand pulled noodles I've ever had. The soup is very flavorful, and the cost is extremely inexpensive!"}
{"text":"After watching them make noodles in the window earlier in the day, we had dinner here last night. Upon being seated, the waiter said they have one thing; three sizes and spicy or not.  Good thing we were looking for that one thing!  We both ordered the small, which is a good portion size, and some appetizers.  The apps, the mushrooms and eggs were good.  Soon after, we were brought two piping hot bowls of delicious noodle soup.  The broth was quite good, and the beef, contrary to one of the Yelp reviews, was just fine.  (This isn't fine dining.)  The noodles and overall spicing and flavor was excellent.  It was perfect for what we wanted for dinner.  I would recommend it if you are looking for a great bowl of soup."}
{"text":"One of my coworkers recommended this restaurant. Best hand pulled noodles you will ever try. Portions are huge! I would definitely come here again!!"}
{"text":"Bustling, tasty Lanzhou hand-pulled noodle place in Montreal Chinatown. There was a line when we got there for Saturday lunch, but it moved quickly. The staff was pleasant but busy.  My wife had the special, which was a beef noodle soup. I had dan dan mian. Both were delicious. As a heads up, the dan dan mian did not come in a soup (the way I've typically had it in NYC). Unexpected for me, maybe it's common, but it was very good."}
{"text":"Honestly in terms of food I would have given 3.5 or 4. The reason I am giving one star is because of service was just horrible.  I asked for a bowl so that I can share the noodle. The waiter gave ridiculous reason and refused to give a bowl. I was first surprised by his attitude then the fact that restaurant is refusing to give an empty bowl to customer. Seriously, wtf? Later on he brought the bowl but then why did he even refuse to give to begin with? Because of service I was about to give zero tip but I still tipped.  Another thing, this place debit or cash only. I wasn't clear on it since I could not find any sign."}
{"text":"I just order one soup for take out....it's over price,and the beef was not fresh...and the soup taste nothing....I think I like Vietnamese pho more than Lanzhou noodle..sorry..."}
{"text":"Arrived at Montreal late in the day. Found this place while browsing & yelping, decided to give it a try.   The line was out the door when we arrived at the restaurant. Decided to get take outs & bring back to the hotel. Ordered the medium beef noodles & the special beef tendon noodles (limited Availability on Friday - Sunday)  The noodles are really chewy, actually have a bounce when biting into it. The kids love it. The beef tendons are pretty good too.  The beef from the beef noodle soup were not seasoned, it was pretty bland until eaten with the tendon spicy soup base. And the soups itself are quite salty.   The restaurant does not seem to have AC, it was quite stuffy & hot, was sweating while waiting for order."}
{"text":"So, I can't say I'm a fan. After ordering the traditional beef hand pulled noodle, I was quite disappointed. I thought the broth was pretty weak, which is made better with the adding of a shitton of vinegar and chili oil. The meat has very little flavour, but the noodles are nice when pulled right. A few strains were under/overpulled, I might try the Za Jiang Mian but I'll not order the soup noodles anytime soon again."}
{"text":"Good noodles especially beef noodles; abhorrent service on the other hand, but food is worth coming for"}
{"text":"We order the beef bowl and the beef tendon bowl that they only make on the weekends.  I think the flavor was ok but the tendon and meat was not as tender as what I would have preferred.  It was so crowded on the tiny tea house chairs that we kept getting hit.  Maybe this would be better if you did take out."}
{"text":"Very cheap, portions are big and it is a great place for a quick full meal. The menu is is very limited tho and seating is not comfy, so I wouldn't recommend it for a meal where you planning to stay and chill for a bit with friends or family."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant above G&D Market in Chinatown with the live display of a worker making the noodles fresh right in front of you. It certainly attracts tourists but the place is good to frequent even for locals.  We got the cucumber salad for appetizer. I really like the peanut crumbles sprinkled on top. The cucumber tasted refreshing and spicy, it reminded me of cucumber kimchi. They use a lot of the Szechuan peppers so it's a bit numbing.  We ordered the noodles with braised beef tendon and Zhajiang. I especially liked the Zhajiang, which was cold noodles. I really liked the black bean sauce and the tea egg was as good as usual. I think I would've wanted more of the sauce compared to the noodle portion they gave us. The braised beef tendon was super tender and soup was heart-warming.   It's cool that you can choose the size of your noodles here, from round thin noodles to thick flat noodles. I always go with the thinnest round ones, I found they have the best chewy texture.  Everything was not suuuper amazing but definitely above average and I'd come back again."}
{"text":"A great place to go for a big, cheap, yummy bowl of noodles. Especially good when you're sick. Definitely go for the classic beef soup. The broth is flavourful, and fresh hand-pulled noodles are fantastic."}
{"text":"Delicious well-made hand-pulled noodles.  Soup was flavorful (a bit over salted IMHO).   Can see chef hand making noodles throughout the day.   Special beef noodle soup available Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  We ate here twice during our 4-day visit to Montreal!    Restaurant was an easy 5 to 10 mins walk from Notre Dame."}
{"text":"The place is super simple and easy going and super busy but a must do stop ... China town needs a visit and so this place. Ordered the meat noodle soup no spicy and it was very nice. If you like a bit of spicy the \"spicy\" version is the one to order. To be back."}
{"text":"I've never had this type of noodles before, so not a ton to compare them too, but I thought the noodle soup was delicious... It was cool to see them hand making the noodles at the front window. I liked that there weren't a ton of choices, which kept ordering more simple... If you're going to get the traditional soup, it basically just choosing your thickness of noodle and then whether you want spicy or not!  I don't think that getting a large is worth the extra two dollars... I think I definitely would have been satisfied with the medium. I didn't have the thinnest noodle option, but my friend did and those were my favorite.   I prefer pho over these noodles, but pho is basically my favorite thing on earth. I'd definitely recommend this and I will come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I'm not from Montreal but whenever I am in the Chinatown area I go to Lan Zhou. I recommend the place as it is one of the better hand pulled noodle I have had outside of Asia -I usually get the Spicy Beef noodle Combo which includes a salad and tea egg. I recommend getting the medium for $12.97 CAD (before tax) and going with the spicy cucumber salad -the noodles are fresh (high volumes at this restaurant) and beef is tender. The broth is flavorful. I usually skip drinking the broth (too much sodium) but couldn't help myself from taking a few sips. The waiter does ask you how spicy you want your noodles so don't be shy if you can't handle spicy -the spicy cucumber salad is okay but I think it is superior vs the other 2 choices -I wish they would give you the tea egg separately vs dropping it in the broth -the restaurant provides free tea or water -oddly shaped restaurant, L-shaped because it is basically on top of the large supermarket which is downstairs  Would definitely come back and deserves to be in my Montreal Chinatown rotation"}
{"text":"perfect ramen in Montreal, this taste make me recall my childhood memory. It have not ever happen when I eat in restaurant in Canada! I've ordered a medium bowl of beef ramen, I thought I could finish but not, when I packed it home and eat next day for breakfast the noodle is still pretty good!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for a quick meal.  The portion is generous that I can't finish the whole bowl sometimes. I usually order the medium size Lanzhou beef noodle with chili oil.   It cost around 12$(taxes and tips included). The noodle is chewy and the soup base is delicious. The beef slices are also well marinated and it has the perfect proportion of tendon and meat.  I also like their cold dishes. The edamame is my favorite and if I am hungry enough I would ask for an extra egg.    The location however is crowded and you may not have enough place to put down ur coat and bags.  Highly recommend this place for anyone who want try the authentic Chinese noodles with a decent price."}
{"text":"Noodles were pretty good. Be warned, their medium size is the biggest medium I've ever had. No wait on an early Friday evening although the place was at capacity."}
{"text":"SUPER YUM. Five stars for taste PLUS such value!   I came for lunch, and there is always a line-up. But don't be afraid, the line goes somewhat fast, and you can  The three other friends I was with all ordered the standard Lanzhou noodles (on page 1 of the menu), but I wanted to venture out and try the noodles with beef tendon, and boy, did I make the right choice!   You can choose your noodle thickness, and I went with the second thickest option, which was perfectly chewy and delicious. I really liked that they included a condiment on the table of spicy sauce with chili oil (it was barely spicy) so I piled that onto each bite of noodles I ate, which further heightened the medley of flavours in my mouth! ;)   Also, I was SUPER IMPRESSED with the amount of meat they gave; I feel like I got my money's worth and the quality of the meat was not too fatty. My friends were all eyeing my noodles and tried some of my meat too.   Only downside: no AC, so you're sweating bullets. Make sure to drink lots of iced water, wear less, and eat fast! :P"}
{"text":"The noodles were fresh and handmade. As with all handmade noodles, they have a good bite to it. I would've liked the noodles a little chewier, but it's still a lot better than dried or refrigerated noodles you buy in the supermarkets. The soup for the beef noodles tasted a little bland. Surprisingly, I liked the soup of veggie noodles better. It has a nutty taste and reminded me of Thai curry. Portions are large."}
{"text":"My grandparents live in Lanzhou and I visit them every year or two. Therefore, it is safe to say that I know what a good bowl of lanzhou pulled noodles is and this place is the best one I've tasted so far in Montreal.  I only get their signature noodles with the second third noodles (er xi - I find them to have the best texture, nice and chewy but also soft). The broth is nice and flavourful, not quite as good as the real thing but close enough. The only thing that I find lacking is the spicy oil, back n Lanzhou, the bowl is covered with half a cm thick of spicy oil while here I had to nearly empty the pot on the table to achieve a something close.   The wait can be quite long an the eating environment isn't be best but overall great fix when Im missing a good bowl of lanzhou noodles."}
{"text":"This is a popular place with locals and visitors. The food is very authentic and quite flavorful. The beef salad was delicious but a bit too spicy for our kids. The vegetable noodle bowl was excellent with a great array of fresh vegetables and a tea egg.  Edamame salad was also exceptional and quite unique in its flavor.  The decor is fun and creative with upbeat music. Definitely a fun stop for the family."}
{"text":"Honestly wouldn't mind coming here all the time! The noodles are fresh made right before your eyes, where the dough is pulled to the right size depending on the order. The noodle texture is perfect, fresh and chewy with the right kind of bounce. Both the classic soup noddles and the zhajiang noodles were delicioussss. Their egg is great too so if your order doesn't come with one, might as well get one for extra.  The food is a great deal! They give you large portions, even if you choose a small bowl size. I like to take the rest home cause the leftovers make another meal TBH. Theres also some combos that include a side and egg as well. Also, ask for their free tea! It's really mild with Chinese dates and flowers.  The restaurant is small, so expect a lineup. Worth it though!"}
{"text":"After all the rave reviews, we stopped by here on the way home on a Saturday night and ordered two medium nouilles de boeuf to go. The restaurant itself is very small and packed, so we waited by the bar and watched someone expertly make noodles by hand. Our amazing meals were packed right in front of us with the broth packed in a separate container, and I cannot stress how delicious and satisfying a meal this was! It was also incredibly affordable. If you're looking for a reliably delicious meal if you're in the Chinatown neighborhood, this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"Soupe de boeuf braisé: grasse et salée. La texture de la viande ressemble plus un ragoût de boeuf qu'un boeuf braisé. Les piments ne sont pas assez piquants. Place sympathique...concept intéressant. Bonne portion. Menu limité, mais amplement suffisant compte tenu du concept du resto.  Nous pouvons choisir la sorte de nouilles dont plusieurs combinaisons de possible selon le plats commandés."}
{"text":"I came here after a long day of walking and shopping. When I looked at the menu and I saw that there were small, medium, and large servings, I instinctually chose the medium. I was surprised by how large their portions are. Their medium would be a large at most restaurants. The noodles were very good and the soup was delicious as well. It was an experience to see the chef make the noodles in front of you. This was my first Chinese meal since moving here, and as a Chinese person, I think that the taste is rather authentic. I really enjoyed my meal here. I highly recommend this restaurant and I will be returning here soon."}
{"text":"Basically........ The place is smaller than I expected but the portions were larger than I expected. That large soup is the perfect size, at least for me! Great place, great food and yes I would go back."}
{"text":"I just discovered this cozy place and I'm glad I did. The delicious noodles are made before your very eyes and come in 6 different thicknesses, completed with a very flavourful broth."}
{"text":"After months of searching, I finally got to try an authentic Noodle soup with a vegetarian broth thanks to Aruns review. I would always be so tempted by the delicious waft of a warming soup bowl from the various places downtown filling the air but whenever inquiring on whether their vegetarian soup bowl uses an actual vegetarian broth, I would get a negative answer.   By chance, I happened to pass by Nouilles de Lan Zhou one bitter-cold Friday evening. It was absolutely freezing (-22) and despite not being hungry, we needed a place to quickly warm up so we could continue to our destination. Seeing the fresh noodles being hand made in front of my eyes through the restaurant window, I was pulled in and decided to order a small vegetarian noodle soup to try. It was my first time at such a place and I was not accustomed to the ordering system. Thankfully, the server was extremely friendly and guided me through the ordering process. He explained all the noodle types and thicknesses and confirmed that the broth was vegetarian. As we were eating in, he also brought us each a small cup of hot green tea.  Within 5 minutes my order arrived and I was instantly taken aback by the portion size! The bowl was huge for a small-size and I wasn't even hungry! Still however, I managed to gobble it down and enjoyed it very much with the chilli oil. The flavours were very fresh and the noodles were perfect.  The interior is very basic with cramped seating in a very small space. There is also an escalator leading down to a grocery store which I found very unusual and random. If it was closer, I would probably grab a takeaway as I wasn't too comfortable inside. However, still a great first- time experience - will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner! Considering the cold weather that has just set upon us, nothing better than a good soup to warm our hearts. Went there on a cold Saturday for dinner with friends. I arrived a little after my friends were already. When arrive, there was a line already. To consider, this restaurant has very limited seating spots as it is located right above a grocery store. Lines are to be expected at any time of the day due to that.   The menu itself offers very small variety, which can be good or bad. In this case, it is definitely a good thing since they have perfected their menu to those limited items. You can also decide which kinds of noodles (size and shape) you want. Worth mentioning is their weekend special which my friends praise a lot. Unfortunately, as a non-spicy eater, I was not able to taste it. I have opted for the original noodle bowl. It came to 12$ for a large bowl, before taxes. By large, I mean LARGE. There were so many noodles! I was barely able to finish it even coming in hungry. The flavors were not varied but well done.   Overall, very good value for quality and quantity. Would recommend in a heartbeat, especially during cold weather like the ones we have in Montreal."}
{"text":"Best hand pulled noodles ever! Perfect for chilly weather with generous portions on soup and noodles. I don't think they add any MSG since I left the restaurant stuffed and thankfully not dehydrated. Make sure to eat the thicker noodles quick because they will get soggy if you don't slurp em up fast enough.   I got the small combo which comes with a small side dish. I tried the pickled edamame which was a little too street market tasting for me and the cucumbers which were pretty spicy! The pickled edamame went perfect with the soup, however, so I highly recommend dumping some in your noodle soup for added flavor.  If you're wondering how big of a bowl you should order... definitely no larger than a medium unless you are STARVING."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. Located above the entrance of an underground Chinese grocery store, this restaurant is a tiny tiny cramped space housing the best hand pulled noodles in the area. For those that don't know, the Chinese city of Lan Zhou is famous for their hand pulled noodles, as long as you step foot inside this restaurant you're doing something right.   The setup and menu are extremely simple. The table setting is reminiscent of how noodle shops in China are like--with a bucket full of chopsticks and black vinegar for the noodles. The noodles had a perfect springiness to them and just FYI THE SMALL IS THE SIZE OF A NORMAL RAMEN BOWL. My dad unwittingly ordered the large and if I had a hamster, it could do some serious swim laps in that thing, no lie. The price is extremely cheap for what it is. DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE. Be prepared for a line, we waited about 10-15 mins"}
{"text":"When it comes to getting a cheap and huge (relative to size) bowl of noodles in Montréal, it really doesn't get better than this. Nouilles de Lan Zhou has always been my go-to place whenever our friend group wants to get something cheap and quick to eat in a lively social setting. The restaurant is cleaner and more attractive in terms of design than your typical Chinese restaurant, so I guess that's a plus for people who think that matters.  I always get the medium spicy Lanzhou beef noodle bowl with a tea egg. Medium-sized bowls here are more or less like a large anywhere else, and they only cost $12-$13 including tax depending on if you get an egg or not. While the broth is by no means spicy (which is disappointing considering normally one or two small spoonfuls should do the trick), it still has a nice flavor to it that is aided by hints of cilantro and radish. The noodles are perfectly bouncy and seem endless, which are perfect since I love slurping up noodles! The beef, however, seemed to have gone down in quality since I was last here, since I felt like it consisted of more cartilage than usual instead of actual meat.  Especially in comparison to other Chinese restaurants, this place is definitely one of the better options. While it's not nearly as good as the real deal back in China, it's still a solid choice and a good place to introduce your friends to authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"I'm someone who honestly doesn't care about the service much(unless it's notably bad), I'm just there for the food. Which is why I gave this place a 4 star, because the noodle soup was imo amazing, the portion was big despite the fact that I ordered a small. The service is extremely fast, you'll get your food in no time.   But the place is tiny and it reflects on the service a lot, it doesn't bother me but I imagine it could bother some people and is important to anyone who plans on coming here. This really isn't a regular restaurant, it's food first, everything else second. It's more like a food stall with seats; you eat, you pay, you leave. I think there's like 2 tables that seats 4 people, sometimes you end up being seated right next to strangers. So if you're expecting a nice comfortable restaurant, you're looking at the wrong place. They do have a take out option.  I also noticed most of the people that were eating there would leave as soon as they were done, so this kind of \"restaurant\" is normal to the regulars."}
{"text":"Best beef noodle soup ever! After a cold day of hiking in the snow, we were ready for a hot bowl of broth and noodles. First, the noodles are hand pulled right at the window, #Authentic. You get to choose your noodles size/thickness and shape. There's different bowl sizes, I went for the medium and its pretty sizable. We ordered the beef bowl with chili oil (omg yes please). The place is pretty small so there may be a wait and the menu only contained a few signature items. Each bowl is made to order, so there's true freshness. The broth was perfect and just the perfect thing to soothe your cold soul."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic noodle dishes. Tasty and not boring. Ambiance is genuine and the resturant is located in the heart if Chinatown. We were looking for the genuine dish and we found it. Perfect mixture of flavors and textures. Hot too! Which was good for Californians walking about in 30 degree Montreal weather.  I ordered the Brazed beef dish - medium spicy. HUGE amount of food!"}
{"text":"Delicious noodles and broth at a great price. Huge portions, noodles made in house in the traditional manner. Very professional."}
{"text":"We came in just shortly before they opened at 11am. They let us come in to sit instead of waiting outside. Many others had sat inside already before us. I guess they wanted to avoid long lineup on the side walk during prime hours. They let us browse the menus but they did not take our orders until right after 11 am. A very good blend of tea was also served then as well.  Overall, I must say the broth and the noodles were excellent. Very natural beef broth tasting without a lot of salt. Even the side dishes were not bad at all. We tried the house beef noodle in the \"third thin\" size and the dry pork noodles. They let you choose and specify the hand-pulled noodle size from the super thin to super fat depending on your own noodle texture preference. You can even choose the spicy level too.  Even a medium is quite large. Make sure you get their combo to get a side dish, a tea egg, and a beef noodle in a cheaper combo price vs a la carte pricing. Pork noddle unfortunately only comes in one huge size! We had to pack half of it in the end. Will come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice and authentic Chinese noodle boutique. You have a variety of choices on noodle and the meat and the soup are all carefully prepared."}
{"text":"I don't normally love plain beef soup, but I cannot argue with how delicious the broth and home made noodles are.  I also can't argue with the $7.99 price tag for a small (hint - it ain't so small) red noodle soup.    Yummmmmmm.  A little wait but damn good"}
{"text":"Great food! The noodles were served extremely quickly and they tasted nice. The servers are very helpful, and we enjoyed the restaurant a lot"}
{"text":"What to add to the long list of this noodle and beef broth soup spots accolades!?   the point: today being New Years Day.... LONG FRESH HAND PULLED noodles for an auspiciously long, healthy and prosperous life and red monkey year. Red Monkey is said to be prosperous for small businesses so happy to appease the plucky celestial primate.  ...shivering when I arrived and fortified for the stroll all the way back to Mile End afterwards.  Umm, so, yesh happy comfort camper."}
{"text":"Just look for the tourists standing outside the window watching the chefs pull their noodles!  Now this is a damn fine bowl of soup. Savoury broth and deliciously chewy noodles. Soup bowls are enormous so show up hungry or just order a small. Make sure to add a healthy splash of black vinegar before you start slurping. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Service was snappy and the food was great. The noodle soup is fantastic - i ordered a Medium and couldn't finish it. I'm amazed at the folks who could finish a large bowl. I asked the waiter if I should order the extra beef and he was honest enough to recommend that I wait and see if the beef portion in my stew was enough (it was more than enough!). I don't speak French, but I wish the waiter had told us that you could change the thickness of the noodles and even order flat ones. We sat by the bar and could watch the noodles being made which was very entertaining. I wish the waitress was more attentive with the waters though. All in all, a great Chinese food experience in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Soup was very good, with well made, fresh noodles. Get the medium as the large is gigantic!  Only (small) critique was that \"spicy\" broth wasn't all that spicy. Cucumber appetizer was a highlight--szechwan peppercorns made the dish sublime. Definitely will try to get back here the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Got the medium Special Nouilles de Bouef Lanzhou with the noddles (jo ye - flat). Small place and there was a line, but the service is quick so we didn't wait long. The noodles came out quick. The medium is bigger than what we anticipated. Soup and noodles was simple/clean(?) and very filling. Meat was tender. Bring cash!"}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant though so it's a bit of a wait but we weren't in a rush so it's fine. I had a medium beef noodles and it was honestly too big (should've gotten a small). I really like that the soup isn't too salty but it was flavourful. I had the three xi noodles and they were delicious! My friend had the ??? (zajiangmian) and it was excellent too. I'll have that next time because having soup noodles was a workout and a half. Overall great experience, just a little bit busy and service is a little slow but the food came fast. Would come again!"}
{"text":"The most flavourful and delicious soup ever and the noodles? Hhmmmmmmmm!!!!! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"As a Chinese who loves Lanzhou noodles, I can say this is authentic and delicious.  They gave a lot of beef slices and hand stretched noodles are the best!   We will definitely come back Whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant 15 minutes before they supposedly close, but it looks like they kept taking in people as they came in. In a small kitchen with a window facing the street, the cooks made fresh noodles (to the width ordered- narrow to very wide), cooked noodles, added sides and broth. It is an amazing production. We had the cucumber and seaweed salad, which tasted fresh and nicely pickled. We had the cold marinated sliced beef with scallions, hot pepper sauce, and peanuts. This was a nice addition to our beef noodle soup. I got the wide noodles, which went well with the excellent broth, scallions, and beef.   We are happy we stopped by here for an excellent meal and service. They only take Canadian debit cards and cash."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend visiting this place! Their noodles are delicious and there are so many kinds you can choose from. It's a fun experience being in the restaurant too because they make the noodle in an open style kitchen where you can see it.   For their main noodle menu, you can choose the shape and thickness of the noodle. I found thinner noodles better than thick ones, but you can really cater it to your preference!   The only downside is that the place is small and cramped so if you're going on a busy day/time, there will most likely be a wait."}
{"text":"Fresh pulled noodles were delicious, the broth itself was a little bland. Medium bowl is definitely big enough to share between two people, if sharing I would recommend getting extra meat tho! I recommend getting the edamame starter, they were my favorite."}
{"text":"Came here after a long bus ride from Quebec and it really hit the spot. The guy literally pulls the noodles near the customers, and the portions are huge. I got a small and it was absolutely enough for me. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"The reviews about this 'hole in the wall' are not fake.  You will get to eat the best beef noodle soup bowl here.  They have a selection of noodles that are made from scratch.  I went with the suggestion of the waiter.  The medium bowl is large enough when you are starving ;)  The sides salads are very interesting and make for an interesting appetizer.  This is a small restaurant and remains relatively crowded at all times.  Be prepared for a short wait at lunch and dinner time.  Service is super quick and the waiters are very helpful.  The soup bowls taste amazing and keeps you wanting for more.  Pricing is relatively low which makes the experience even better.  Do not forget to take a walk around China Town after your meal to try out some interesting desserts.  Will I return? : Heck, yeah!"}
{"text":"This place is decent. It's your typical hand-pulled noodle house and the portions are large and prices are average. The place ain't big, it's tight, but this is one of those in and out food places. You don't stick around for an hour to catch up with a friend."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious stuff! We were lucky to get in before the line amassed for lunchtime. Beware - get the SMALL bowl unless you are RAVENOUS (which we thought we were, each got a Medium and it was maaaasssivvve). We were a little gutted after we ordered that they didn't let us know there were different noodle shapes to get so look out for that on the menu and see if you have a preference.  We both had the signature beef noodles, and sure was tasty. We got the combo which means we got an egg and a little side dish of veg (edamame and cabbage salad). They were nice enough to let us use credit card (we were out of cash at the end of our trip), but normally only cash or debit so heads up there.  We got to sit at the little bar and watch the kitchen in action. Was really interesting!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are traveling in and I saw a big line down the street. We grabbed a menu and waited, I am so glad we did.   We got seated pretty quickly and was asked if it was okay to sit with another couple at a bigger table, we had no problem with it so we squeezed in. I didn't even care that there was not a lot of wiggle room.   We got the beef noodle and even got to pick what kind of noodles. If you didn't already know they hand make the noodles right there, I took a video and will add it so you can see what you're getting into.   We ordered a large to split and we couldn't finish it. The meat was cooked perfectly, the noodles were out of this world, and the soup was spicy and had a mix of dry spices and oil that made every bite so good. They added fresh veggies and herbs on top.   I can't recommend it more. We honestly loved it so much that after just finishing the left overs today for lunch we are heading back again tonight since we leave tomorrow."}
{"text":"Great hand made noodles with health yummy  salads dishes.  It's pretty small but your turn comes pretty fast.   Definitely go for a set of noodle, salad & egg. You need to specifically tell them you want a set menu otherwise they may charge entree which is much higher.   Can only."}
{"text":"I really loved the authentic noodles at Nouilles de Lan Zhou. I love how you get to choose between 7 different styles of freshly hand pulled noodles. I ordered the thin flat noodles and my girlfriend ordered the super thin round noodles which were as thin as angel hair pasta; I really liked both styles. I was very full from the medium sized bowl. I did like the beef tendon bowl a lot more than the braised beef bowl. The braised beef slices were very bland to me. The beef broth was delicious and had great depth of flavor. The beef tendon bowl was spicy but not too oily, just the way I like. My only complaint is that the restaurant space is really poor. The Restraunt is basically the first floor of an Asian supermarket downstairs and the space is very cramp with no place to hang your coat."}
{"text":"handmade noodles with your option to chose circle/flat and various ranges of size to chose from. the soup is light but great to cure that hangover and/or just in the mood for some great authentic noodles.  the combo is great- you get an option of the cold/spicy cucumber, cold seaweed & potato, or a third option that i didn't even pay attention to.  we also got an order of the cold spicy beef which was great to share among 6 of us.  the great thing about this place is the ability to chose your noodle size, shape, and spice level. word of advice, go less spicier b/c you can always add more spicy oil. the small is almost like a regular size but plenty of people were wolfing down the medium sized bowl (which was almost as big as their face),  the place is small so go as a group of 4 max unless you expect to wait until the long table/ledge is open. the service is eh however come for the soup and hand pulled noodles."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3/5 for the overall taste. I had that house soup and this is my breakdown:  Pros: Fresh al dente noodles Considerable amount of meat Generation portion of noodle and soup  Cons: Overlly salty soup base drawning the flavour (kidney hurting saltiness )  I had tried fair amount of noodle places in various cities and I'm sad to inform you Yelpers that is not the \"best beef noodle place\" around. Adding tons of salt on your beef broth doesn't mean it will be the most savoury and tasty soup ever!!!"}
{"text":"Be honest this one just not meet my expectation. I was told by my friend in toronto they had a fabulous noodles even better in toronto. I have order the beef belly noodles. The noodles was fine but the meat not tasty at all. Will never try again."}
{"text":"This will be my first stop the next time I come back to Montreal. There's a large bowl with my name on it. I may not be able to finish it but you bet your elastic waisted pants, I will give it my all.  Stick with their specialty - the Beef Noodle Soup - with its wonderfully tender beef and deliciously chewy noodles. And you get to choose your noodle shape/size - what fun! The broth was flavorful with a touch of chili oil to give it a little more oomph. Bring tissues for that runny nose. I got a small bowl, which was plenty filling with its generous portions. While b.'s Vegetable Noodle Soup was decent, the odd topping of seaweed salad in the soup turned the broth an unappetizing green color halfway through.  $6.99 for a small, $8.99 for a medium, and $10.99 for a large.  Seating is crowded so you may end up sharing a table with strangers. There was no A/C when we went and it was a fairly warm day so you may end up sharing a table with sweaty strangers. b. noted that the bowls may or may not be entirely sanitized as the woman seemed to be only rinsing them off with pressurized (hopefully hot) water, so don't go licking them clean. The restaurant itself is awkwardly situated above a supermarket with stairs and an escalator right smack dab in the middle. This is a plus for the occasional air-conditioned breeze from below if you're seated by the railing, for people watching, and for grabbing dessert afterwards - Pocky!"}
{"text":"Fresh made noodles. You can decide the thickness when you order. We tried the small dan dan noodles and the infamous beef tendon noodle soup. Noodles tasted great and the broth was flavorful and delicious. It is not as spicy as you think it is so if you like your food spicy, you should ask for extra spicy. The space is pretty tight but looked like tables turnover pretty fast so you shouldn't have to wait too long."}
{"text":"I'd had Lan Zou style Lamen (La = pulled, Men = noodle) before, several times, in Asia and Montreal. This is definitely not the real deal, but the lack of authenticity aside (I don't judge food by its authenticity; I grew up with and love General Tao and Butter Chicken).  The noodles are not very good. They are hand-made for sure, but so are the noodles from Nudo 2 minutes away, Yuki Lamen (sp?) at Concordia's Faubourg and that one Lamen shop at Eaton Center's food court, and frankly, it's not very good or fresh here.  The seating is atrocious here. It's very cramped, since it's a semi-open area to the outside, flies is a problem in summer and the extreme coldness is a problem in winter. Plus the floor  are just disgusting. The tables aren't very clean either, you'll most likely get your winter jacket and/or shirt dirtied.  The soup stock is itself is very watered down and tasted mainly... I dunno how to describe the flavor that only chemically constituted beef bouillon cube can provide. You might make better beef stock with half chemical flavoring and half real meat and/or bone at home.  TL;DR: Meh noodle, bad soup, extremely back setting. Good proximity to the metro, much better options, including other Lan Zhou style Lamen, to be had within 3 minutes walking distance."}
{"text":"So happy this place lived up to my best memories of fresh noodles in Chinese hutongs (I've never been to Lan Zhou but would love to eat my way on through.) It's bright and tiny and the food moves fast and the staff are quick and kind, they thoughtfully offered us to move to a bigger table and laughed and waved and smiled when I yelled my joyful thanks at them on the way out the door. And man, did this team deserve the thanks. They make lovely hand pulled noodles and serve it in gorgeous broth with garlicky soy beans, tea soaked boiled eggs, just so good. Also, we shared the trio between two people and it was plenty, the bowl of noodles was more like a tureen of mega goodness. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If you can score a table for a bowl of this soup, do it.  It's small, cramped, and usually busy.   You may have to wait a few.  It's okay. It's worth it.  Everyone is there for the same reason - to eat those bowls of steamy soup, made with hand pulled noodles.  Before you enter, you get an inkling of the goodness to come - the guy in the window is painstakingly and expertly working a hunk of dough into thin strands of fresh soup noodles. Over and over.  There are only a few items to order. Get the Lanzhou special soup.  A medium is plenty for most and probably more than enough for some.  The slighly spicy cucumber salad is a perfect accompaniment to those big bowls of broth.  Slurp. Repeat. Wipe your forehead and do it again.  5 stars."}
{"text":"They seat you along a thin ridge of tables and chairs that overlooks the stairs to a Chinese market.  Able staff thread themselves in and out.  You never have to wait long for a table or be served with complete friendliness and efficiency.  The food is outstanding.  The noodle is Udon, which is Japanese style, but the flavor is distinctly Chinese.  The cucumber salad with garlic peanut hot sauce for two dollars plus is exceptional and compliments the soup perfectly.  I ordered the tender beef and it melted in my mouth.  This is a great stop on the way to or on the way back from Old Town Montreal."}
{"text":"The broth is tasty, and the noodles have the right consistency. The only piece that needs some improvement is the beef, it was a bit dry as some of the the other reviews said."}
{"text":"Excellent noodle soup! However the beef tended to have a lot of fat on it and was chewy (not tender) which was disappointing and unexpected based on previous reviews. The flavor of the broth and the fresh noodles however were stellar. We sat at the small bar when you walk in so we could watch them make the noodles to order which was a nice treat. Two of us got the large soup and split it which was still a lot for two people.  If we return, we will probably split the medium instead..."}
{"text":"While I was walking toward G&D grocery store yesterday, I stumbled by this place which served handmade noddles. It got me curious and I went there today for lunch.   When I went in, I felt like I was back to the old chinatown ( but cleaner) that I used to grow up in. The kitchen staff told me to pick a seat. I took a seat next to the stairway down  the grocery store and the waitress gave me a menu. While I was looking at the menu, a waiter came in to take my order, I took the one with the beef noodle soup with no spice and a seaweed salads. Initially, I wanted a medium bowl but he reassured me that a small is enough for me. Then, he went to give my orders to the kitchen staff.   After 3 minutes of waiting, my seaweed salads came, I took one bite at the seaweed and I was blown away. It has the right texture and the right sweetness in it. Next, my noodle order came and I took a bite and I was pleasantly surprise of the freshness of the noodles and the broth is not overwhelming that I literally wanted to drink the whole thing. The beef was the right quantity too, I can't complain.   Overall, the place is well decorated, the staffs care about their customers and the food lives up to the hype. It's great that the menu options are limited because I wouldn't know which one I want to order (they all look so good!). I will come back in the future.   Xie xie!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and even better food. The portions are fantastic, with a large size being enough to feed two people. I've eaten noodles prepared this way in China, and these taste identical! Handmade noodles and fast service. The real deal. I actually came here to eat dinner two days in a row."}
{"text":"They make the noodle fresh but so-so for flavor. We ordered the special spicy beef noodle soup and spicy noodle with pork. We preferred the spicy beef noodle soup. It was rather expensive $30 for 2 bowls of noodle soup and a diet coke in Chinatown. Customer service is non existence so don't expect any - we asked for our diet coke 4x after my husband tried to get it out of the locked fridge by himself!"}
{"text":"Noodle soup is only ok; we are not impressed. Waiter is neither friendly nor professional. And our beef noodle soup comes with a slice of pork!?"}
{"text":"Saw a nearby yelper post photos and review for this place and it immediately caught my attention.  We dropped by for lunch on Tuesday and my hubby and I were blown away by the flavors.  I don't think we've ever tasted any beef noodle soup that was this perfectly seasoned and well balanced. The restaurant is pretty small with about 10 tables and a long table against the wall w/ stools and a few seats in front of their kitchen.  The restroom is on the 5th floor of the building that you have to access w/ a service elevator.  We ordered:  Julienned squash & seaweed salad - refreshingly perfect! The sweet, salty, and acidity levels were all in perfect harmony.  Cucumber appetizer - the cucumbers were coated in a creamy, porky, and spicy sauce. It had a nice amount of heat and very tasty.  Cold beef w/ chili oil - served w/ scallions, 1 broccoli and 1 cauliflower, and sate chili oil. The chili oil was packed w/ flavor and had a slight delicious garlic flavor.  This definitely elevated the dish.  This beef is the same beef they use in the noodle soup dish.  Beef noodle soup (Large) - WOW, this bowl was HUGE! Luckily hubby and I shared this bowl.  The noodles, meat, broth, and chili were all PERFECTION. We added an egg to this dish for an extra $1. The egg was full of flavor and hubby enjoyed it very much.  There was also daikon in the bowl, but I didn't eat it.  Wish it came with some greens, but that's okay b/c we had 2 veggie sides to eat along with the noodle soup.    Our lunch was so good that we came back and ordered the zhajiang mian and the julienned squash & seaweed salad togo for dinner.   Zhajiang mian - huge portion served w/ broth on the side.  The pork and fermented black bean sauce was delicious.  This bowl had julienned carrots, bok choy, edamame, and pieces of pickled mustard greens.  It was definitely tricky tossing the noodles when we got back to our hotel b/c the noodles had congealed together.  A few minutes in the microwave loosened up the noodles which solved the issue.  Overall, we would definitely return to this restaurant if we visit Montreal again.  Delicious food, fast service, and very affordable/cheap prices!"}
{"text":"Typical traditional Chinese restaurant. My Chinese friend took me there and showed us around the menu. We've selected about 8 dishes and all were tasty and satisfying. Recommended."}
{"text":"How can this place be anything less then 5.  They hand pull the noodles in the window all day long and drop straight into the bath for consumption.   Your options are spicy or normal. One of 6 different noodles. One if three different sizes. Period. That's all you need,trust me.  I ordered the medium, spicy and normal noodles. Chewy, flavorful, slightly spicy goodness. Yes goodness.  In from NYC and stopped by with my wife. Would go back again in a heartbeat.  Hummmmmmm chewy goodness."}
{"text":"Quick, very small place where you come in and eat your noodles and get out - in Chinatown fashion. Speed was their name but service was also very courteous despite their crowded small situation. I felt that the noodles were good (who doesn't like hand drawn noodles) but the broth could be better (lacking a bit of depth here). I also got a side salad of spicy cucumbers that had some sort of peanut butter sauce (which in my option was not THAT spicy, maybe a tad lower than sriracha directly on your tongue). I'd recommend coming before the rush hour lunch which is about 12:15 pm on a Monday."}
{"text":"Beware of the large portion!   Took a small bowl of lanzhou beef noodle and couldn't finish. The noodle of a good chewy texture but the soup lack a bit of flavor.  The side dish of seaweed and potato was excellent!"}
{"text":"Authentic LAN ZHOU beef noodles. ?.???"}
{"text":"Expectations? Fresh, quick and tasty. Non-expectations? Variety, room to stretch, exchanging patter with the staff. Oh, and at a very very reasonable price.  This Chinese beef noodle shop is everything one can reasonably want. The noodles are stretched and slapped and twirled and twisted in the front window. Based on the orders, the noodle-maker prepares different sizes, plops a portion into a vat of boiling water. A few minutes later, another person scoops up the noodles, drains them and puts them in a bowl, to which a ladle or two of simmering  clear beed broth is added. At the next station is the daikon, cilantro, chili oil (if so requested), beef slices, tea egg (if requested). There are three sizes and the medium is enough for a football player. There are a few other items like spicy cucumber and edamame. We had two small beef noodle soups, with moxi and Jo Yen style noodles. There are few seats, maybe ten tables and another ten at the counters, so we had to wait ten minutes for a table. Service was fast, price was great! If you are looking for cantonese or Szechuan or Thai or a Chinese banquet, there are a dozen other places within blocks. This place is for beef noodles."}
{"text":"This place is tiny but boy is the food GOOD. Their menu only has 4-5 different noodle dishes which might not seem great but it means that they know how to make it right. Nothing's too spicy and they even let you pick the size of noodles you want. Def going back again!  Now I know what you might be thinking: tiny place + chinese resto...here comes the rant about how awful their service is bla bla. No. Calm down. Their service was actually great. The waiter was super friendly and had a sense of humor. He even gave us two free side dishes because our order was taking longer than expected (we didn't even realize it was delayed).  Recommend"}
{"text":"Soup was extremely salty and the brown noodle was bland.   If they can mix the flavor between the dishes, then it might have been ok at best"}
{"text":"[Montreal Food Tour Stop #1] Delicious, freshly made Chinese noodles in the heart of Montreal Chinatown.  This restaurant is hard to miss - just look for the restaurant with a chef making noodles in the window.  You can stand outside in awe and watch as the noodles are prepared.  Or, the better thing to do would be to go inside and actually try them.  Notable entrees include beef noodle soup and zhajiangmian.  Highlights: The noodles are excellent.  They're soft with good texture.  I ordered the zhajiangmian, which is a large bowl of noodles with pork in a ground bean sauce topped with a layer of vegetables.  You get plenty of food in your order - in addition to your noodle bowl, you'll get a large cup of broth on the side.  The vegetables were very fresh and there was a lot of variety.  I noticed a pleasant herbal taste to the broth - definitely was a good thing to have on the side.  My photo shows a lot of vegetables, but they're not cheap with either the meat or the noodles underneath.  Critiques: Cash and debit only, but this is typical practice for a lot of the best Chinese restaurants.  Luckily, I had exchanged a few USD for some CAD at the overpriced exchange kiosk at the airport. With respect to the dish, the pork was saltier than what I'm accustomed to for this dish.  If the dish were less salty, I'd be giving this five stars.  Overall: Excellent quantity and top notch noodles are served at Nouilles de Lan Zhou.  I'd go back to try the same noodles with other toppings (for example, a beef tendon noodle dish that is only served on the weekends)."}
{"text":"Fresh, hand pulled noodles that are made to order based on your size preference, served with tender slices of beef and steeped in simple broth. Perfect on a cold day.   I only didn't give the 5th star (which I rarely give out) because the broth wasn't as flavorful and complex as I expected.  I highly recommend getting a small because I was stuffed after."}
{"text":"****VEGETARIANS THIS IS YOUR PLACE*****  Rant: It's a darn shame when you're craving a good noodle soup and can't find a place with an actual vegetarian broth. Yes I'll cave and have the chicken broth but damnit I want a guilt free delicious noodle soup and I want it now!  The good news is I've found it. Lan Zhou has the most incredible hand pulled noodles which are slightly chewy and oh so fresh. Their vegetable noodle soup comes in a different broth that they make and tastes incredible. I asked the waiter what the broth is made of and he said it's a secret recipe - how alluring. The coolest part is you can ask for the noodle size you want when you order because they make them to order.   I would have given the place 5 stars if the seating was a bit nicer and comfortable - the over all ambience of the restaurant isn't special but the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"Do not miss this gem in the heart of a mini Chinatown. A very limited menu with some of the best flavored and textured hand pulled noodles. When you taste the quality of the seasoning, the freshness of the broth and the insane taste and chewiness of the noodles you understand why they only need like 10 items on the menu to be this amazing. Do not miss the spicy cold cucumber (staple Schezuan dish) and the wonderfully seasoned Edamame with ginger chillies, both a delicious accompaniment."}
{"text":"One of my favorite beef noodle soup places. Come on a weekend to try the braised beef noodle. Did not disappoint"}
{"text":"Wow, so delicious. I had a small bowl of beef and vegetables, with noodles, medium spicy. Beef was ground beef, sauce had lots of peanuts, herbs, not much broth. Hubby had the beef tendon soup with noodles, also medium spicy. Baby bok choy in both. His broth was do wonderfully beefy and flavorful that this must be one of the recipes where the beef tendons are cooked for hours. Anthony Bourdain would love this place. Noodles are all made and hand-pulled on site. My small bowl was $8.99, hubby's large was $10.99. Cheap amazing food, well worth waiting for. On a very cold Friday at 1:30 we only waited about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Rather small shop with a Chinese grocery store beneath. Arrived around 2:15 and there was still a 10 Minute wait! There was no line when we left though - around 3:00 PM.  Anyways, the noodles are fantastic! I really liked the da kuan, which was the biggest square noodle. My sister loved the thinnest noodles. We also got the thickest circular noodle, but that was a bit on the chewier side for my tastes.  We got the special beef (not the beef noodle soup served seasonally), Dan Dan, and veggie flavors. Highly recommend the first two, the veggie not so much. It had a strange coconut flavor to it, and while I do like coconut, I wasn't feeling it in this soup.  As long as you don't get the veggie, the food is great and the service is fast. I can't imagine what the wait would be during normal hours though. Also, the portion sizes are huge. The small was more than enough for just me. Of course, I finished it cause it was so good, but I left feeling like I was going to burst."}
{"text":"So good. Insanely big portions. Fresh bouncy noodles.  It's tiny, some wait is to be expected if going during peak meal times.The only reason I don't give this place a perfect score is that there are very few menu options. Like now that I've been and tried the one thing I wanted, I don't really have a reason to go back.  Nevertheless a delicious and simple Chinatown option."}
{"text":"Il y a des restos qui servent des pâtes et il y a des restos qui servent des Pâtes.  Celui-ci appartient définitivement à la seconde catégorie...  Tellement fraîches, savoureuses et cuites à la perfection qu'on pourrait en manger un grand bol sans aucun assaisonnement! La soupe au boeuf est absolument délicieuse, quoique la viande soit un peu grasse, assaisonnée juste à point.  Les portions sont extrêmement généreuses: j'ai eu beaucoup de mal à terminer (en fait, je n'y suis pas arrivé complètement) le format médium, et je m'interroge depuis sur la taille du saladier dans lequel on sert le format large... L'endroit lui-même ne paie pas de mine et est assez étrange, éventré qu'il est par un escalier roulant qui mène à l'épicerie du dessous. C'est bruyant et non-climatisé...  Et préparez-vous à une expédition si vous cherchez les toilettes...  Mais le service est ultra-rapide, la bouffe est bonne (sauf les entrées qui sont plutôt ordinaires) et l'amoureux des pâtes fraîches y trouvera son compte à peu de frais. Bref, un autre endroit qui confirme que si l'on veut vraiment bien manger à Montréal pour pas cher, le quartier chinois est extrêmement difficile à battre."}
{"text":"HUGE portions of noodles. My family got 5 of the medium beef special noodle soups and they were gigantic. If you have a big appetite, you may be able to finish a medium, however.   Noodles are made on the spot and definitely taste fresh. The noodle sizes listed on the menu are bigger/thicker than they seem.   Also, make sure to put in the hot chili oil in your soup!!!"}
{"text":"Lawdamercy!  This place was off the hook!  It was a delicious meal for a great price! I had the small combo of the regular beef soup- spicy and it was one the best tasting beef soup with noodles I've ever had. The noodles were bomb, the soup was perfect for Montreal's cold weather, and the tea egg was yummy. The portions are huge!!   This place is always busy and crowded so my part of 2 had to share a table but we did not care. We drank the delicious tea they served us and merrily ate our dishes and left with a full warm belly.   Only thing is the service is a little mehhhh but I could look past that."}
{"text":"This is by far the best beef noodle soup restaurant I ever had. We came here because of the crowds and long waiting line while visiting Old Montreal. We thought it must be good. No surprise it was very good. The restaurant is very small and table sitting is very limited. Sometimes you might have to share table with others. So if you don't like the cramped sitting and space, you will not like here. Now for the food, the beef noodle soup was excellent. Not only it tasted great, it was huge in portion. You need a big appetite to finish it."}
{"text":"If this place were a slight bit larger and they served fresh water vs. leaving pitchers on the table unchanged from customer to customer, it would have been a 5 star rating.  There isn't much to the menu but what they do, they do extremely well.  Noodle soup is their speciality with some variations to what you can get in it.  Not being red meat or pork eaters we went for the veggie (chicken wasn't an option nor was shrimp).  Noodles were excellent.  It is very cool being able to watch how they are made.  The broth was very well seasoned and the veggies were perfectly cooked.  We ordered a large and a small since we were not completely sure how filling it will be.  Well we finished it all but could have gone with one large bowl for the three of us.  Definitely a great choice for our early afternoon option."}
{"text":"Best noodles period. Every time I go to Montreal I have to eat here. Can get busy though and not the place if you want to enjoy a nice relaxing meal. You come here for amazing noodles, hand made in front of you and the best price quality in Montreal."}
{"text":"De très bonnes nouilles Dan Dan !  Ça fait quelques temps que je recherchais un restaurant chinois avec d'authentiques nouilles et je suis ravie de l'avoir enfin trouvé ! Les nouilles sont préparées minutieusement selon la technique traditionnelle. Elles sont fines, très longues et parfaitement cuites.   J'ai pour ma part testé les nouilles Dan Dan au buf. La viande est très bonne, et le plat est plein de saveur (demander sans coriandre si vous n'aimez pas ça, ils sont assez généreux).   Les entrées sont bonnes également, je recommande néanmoins de les partager car les plats sont plutôt copieux (même la taille M).   Pour ce qui est des prix, ils sont très corrects (entre $10 et $12 pour les nouilles). À vos baguettes !"}
{"text":"Authentic, definitely worth trying it out! Portion tends to be big. I ordered middle-sized and it's too big (even though I'm super hungry). Add an egg too!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is located on the ground floor of a building. Shares an entrance with an underground grocery store. Shoppers going to the store have to walk through the restaurant. Don't expect much service or ambiance at this place. it is a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown after all.  You have to have the beef hand pulled noodles at a place like this.  Smashed Cucumber app - 5, very unique taste, peanut butter with Sichuan peppercorn.  Noodles - 5, as good as it gets Broth - 3, not a lot of beefy taste, mainly salt  Overall - 4/5, maybe graded on a Montreal curve, this is a 5."}
{"text":"Second time there and loved it again! 2 for 2! Had the spicy beef noodle soup and I loved it. I brought my coworker and he thinks it's the best noodles he has ever had. We watched the guy make the noodles and it's pretty impressive and the Italians have nothing on the Chinese when it comes to noodles. Boots!"}
{"text":"The noodles are the best!!! Their menu is very limited but you know it's good when there is a long line of people waiting to be seated. The restaurant is small but waiting is worth it."}
{"text":"Tiny hole in the wall restaurant above a grocery store. You can see employees running down to get groceries which is interesting haha cramped as if you're eating in China, not saying that's a bad thing at all! I took one star away cause it was so hot in there you couldn't fully enjoy the food. Makes service really efficient! Had the beef brisket noodle which is one size, and that size is LARGE, I ate as much as I could and it's as if I ate nothing at all, but at least we could take it home. My boyfriend got the vegetarian one and it tasted pretty good. The cold spicy cucumber was good! And price is not bad for the amount of food. Next time I would want to try the original beef noodles"}
{"text":"I discovered my new favorite noodle soup. Their soups are very generous and well balanced (from the noodles to the broth). Just to give you an idea, the small is about the equivalent of a ramen soup. The place is very small, so be sure to arrive early or avoid rush hours."}
{"text":"Décidé sur un coup de tête, mais je regrette pas. J'ai pris un plat médium et ça cale super bien. C'est aussi la première fois que je vois un escalator dans un resto. À conseiller"}
{"text":"Are you hungry? REALLY really hungry? Then this is the place you should check out. The restaurant is tiny with limited seatings so you might be seated next to strangers (which we were okay with). I really wished I knew how much food each entree was because I would have shared a bowl of noodle with my boyfriend. We both couldn't finish the food and felt overstuffed afterwards.   They bring out some veggie appetizers before the actual meal which was refreshing to eat. I had their spicy beef noodle while my boyfriend ordered the Nouilles de Zhajiang. The noodles were really fresh and so good! Both dishes were flavorful and not overly salted/spicy.   For the amount of food we got, it was well-worth it. Come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Nothing better than a warm bowl of hand pulled noodles on a cold day. Side dishes very good also."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré mon repas chez Lan Zhou, idem pour le reste de la famille. Ici, on parle d'un menu simplifié. Quelques items, mais très bien maîtrisés. Nous avons tous jeté notre dévolu sur la soupe Lan Zhou (soupe au boeuf). AVERTISSEMENT: si c'est votre première visite, assurez-vous que l'on vous montre ce qu'est une portion \"small\"!  Nous avons tous pris une \"small\" et je suis le seul à avoir terminé mon bol! La \"médium\" est grosse comme un bol à salade et la \"large\" doit pas mal ressembler à un bain pour enfant! :-P"}
{"text":"Tout simplement, délicieux. Service rapide et courtois, mets délicieux et très frais. Nous avons pris 3 plats à deux. Jolie présentation des plats. Les plats sont très copieux.  Si je devais faire une critique, les places assises contre face au mur n'est pas l'idéal, mais les tabourets sont confortables. Ceci étant, c'est critique pour en faire une..  Un restaurant à ne pas manquer dans le quartier"}
{"text":"The classic beef noodle soup is alright but the zhajiangmian is really greasy and flavorless. Love their potato and beans salad"}
{"text":"I've been to China 3 times and visited a lot of holes in the wall kinda restaurants. So I'm very picky when it comes to Chinese food.   This place is close to what I had back in China. Handmade noodles, authentic broth.   I totally like it and the service is super quick."}
{"text":"Love this place. Quick and crowded, loud and tucked away in an unassuming storefront in Montreal's Chinatown. This is not to be missed. You get seated and order. The signature dish is the beef bowl. Choose your size, most people order the medium size. Order your noodle type and size. You can do flat or round, and then choose the thickness. Served up super fast and super hot. We went twice it was so good! Cheapest meal in Montreal and one of the best. The server will bring your check, which you take to the cashier at the front to pay."}
{"text":"This place was very good. I came with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. We ordered the Dan Dan noodles and the Zha Jiang Noodles. Both were amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap, the best non-pho noodle place I've been to in the city  Only downside is the place is kinda small and it's hard to get a spot sometimes, but the food is so good that it makes up for it!"}
{"text":"I liked that they had a variety of noodle options to pick from, I like them thin but the flat one was delicious too. Don't get the widest option unless you like it dough-y. The broth was decent. I wish they had a non spicy braised pork option. Food itself is 4 stars but the environment is 2 stars.  Very tiny tight space! No place to put our huge winter coats where we were sitting."}
{"text":"A small place that is always packed and with good reason. The noodles are delicious and the portions are absolutely giant. They even give you options for extra meat and noodles, which is just ludicrous. Downside is that they only take cash and debit."}
{"text":"Ordered the dandan noodles which was tasteless and oily. The meat sauce poured over the noodles came from the bowl sitting in the microwave. First time last time."}
{"text":"Les meilleurs bouilles de Montréal , excellent resto de nouilles fraîches à chinatown, service rapide et efficace impossible de finir le bol format médium tellement c'est copieux j'y vais souvent surtout l'hiver avec des amis , seul bémols pas de sanitaire sinon le reste c'est correct"}
{"text":"If you love hand drawn noodles and are very hungry, you will love this place.   The portions are large and they specialize in beef noodle soup, beef tendon noodle soup with a wide variety of noodle options from extremely thin to wide. All of their noodles are hand made right out front.  Highlights: - Medium is big enough for normal people. You are competing in a food challenge if you order a Large bowl. - Seating is limitied with around 10 tables and 40 seats total. I would avoid coming during the lunch or dinner rush. - Located in the small Chinatown section of Montreal - Prices are about $10-$12 Canadian per bowl - Service is very quick. - Asian Grocery story on the bottom floor!"}
{"text":"Only problem with this place is too small. And too noisy. They installed right next to an underground entrance.   If you come to a rush hour. You have to wait.   They give big size bowl. Enough for any person. You can choose different type and size of noodles.   I like noodle."}
{"text":"I don't normally go out of my way to eat in China town, but I still need to eat here every 2 weeks or so to satisfy a craving. The dan dan noodles and the classic lan zhou noodles are the best. The broth is flavourful and I always get a side of cucumber and edamame."}
{"text":"Try the spicy cucumber salad with roasted peanuts on top. The broth and all the fixings are very delicious. And the noodles are amazing. Just the right amount of chew and beautifully hand crafted."}
{"text":"Delicious! They have a small menu and the beef tendon noodle soup is only available on weekends. I got a small beef noodle and my boyfriend got a large- the size difference is ridiculous! They're very generous in their portions and small was definitely more than enough for me. The noodles are great, chewy. I got the \"two xi\" size which I think is prefect; boyfriend got the \"three xi\" and it was a bit too thick. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Handmade noodles being pulled and stretched behind a window is always an interesting sight in Montreal. Exciting enough, I ran through the menu and realized that there's only like 3 main course options. This left me a bit disappointed but nonetheless, I opted for their signature Lan Zhou beef noodles.   Like the menu, I was let down. Basically, there's a variety of noodle shapes and sizes available and the noodles I received were two times bigger than the ones depicted in the menu. Not only that but my noodles were definitely undercooked. My broth was average with the oil making most of the flavor but I got to admit that the beef was tender and packed with beefy goodness. Unfortunately, 2 out of the 3 entrees that I tried had unpleasant combinations of flavors that still haunt me to this day.  There are many other restaurants in Chinatown offering noodles and Nouilles de Lan Zhou wouldn't be my first pick."}
{"text":"Hmmm. I had the beef tendon noodle soup. There's only one size for it and that size is \"medium\", the twice-the-size-of-my-face kind of medium. I went alone too and I absolutely hate not finishing my food, so I forcefully finished it and this is probably why I didnt fully enjoy my experience.  The taste of the broth was really rich, the meat was meat with tendon rather than being tendons (which is what I was hoping for). It's also quite on the more greasy side for Chinese Lanzhou Lamian, but overall OK.   Just make sure you have a super huge appetite/bring a friend. I still feel it in my stomach and that was two weeks ago."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese noodles soup place. It's little bit small and sometimes you may have to wait to be seated if you're in a group of 4-6 but it's definitely worth it. The broth is delicious, cucumber salad is really good and it's super cheap.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent beef hand pulled Lan-Zhou noodle soup, this little restaurant is conveniently located on Saint Laurent in the same building as the Asian market which is located on the bottom floor beneath the restaurant . There are three main soup types, beef, chicken and pork all served with hand pulled Lan-Zhou noodles, the most popular is the beef and for good reason it's fabulous with a very rich spicy beefy broth.There are three soup sizes small, medium and large, the two larger sizes can be easily shared as they are hugh; the spiciness of your dish can be selected as well. This is a tiny space seating no more than 20 people at most and gets very crowded quickly but the line seems to move fairly well. This is a great stop for lunch and then a visit downstairs to the market to pick up some of your favorite items. This should be on your list of stops when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Get the chef's recommended braised beef tendon noodle! I was able to try this as well as the Lan Zhou special beef noodle and so I strongly recommend the braised beef noodle!   You ought to order the thick noodle strands. They offer many options of size/kind of noodles, so pick wisely as it could influence your overall impression/experience.  It's a relatively small shop that attracts more than its fair share. Crowds and lines are common."}
{"text":"Definitely five stars! I can tell that it's good enough with no much difference of that in China. I love fresh handmade noodles, especially when you can see how the chef make it. Amazing! I was a little surprised when the first time I had it here since there was so much beef which was kind of pressure  for me to eat it up though it's not greasy at all, but too much, I like its soup also which makes me have quite good appetite. This place is a little crowded so avoid to come at rush hours if you don't want to wait in a line. Besides, I love the decoration of this place, wooden chair wooden table, the containers for the chopsticks and sauces, and the lamps, very classic Chinese."}
{"text":"A very popular place to eat Traditional Chinese beef noodles Lol good appetizers and Zha JIANG mian"}
{"text":"Among one of the most popular noodle shops in Montreal, Lan Zhou Noodle seems to earn the title of the best Chinese Beef Noodle restaurant in the city.  Lan Zhou is located in Chinatown Montreal. Although this historical district is relatively small in size compared to Chinatown in Toronto or Vancouver, it is certainly the most competitive place for an Asian noodle shop to survive. Lan Zhou Noodle almost feels like it was there since the beginning. Noodle pulling demonstration seems doing a great job attracting people passing by the street, so is the at-most atmosphere the place offers to people.  Nothing is better than a big bowl of noodles with hot clear beef broth in the wintertime. Slurping the smooth hand-pulled noodle in a cold day makes me nostalgic and reminds me of the first time I visited this place.  Hot 5 star noodle stop."}
{"text":"Autant on peut avoir un service rapide et manger quelque chose de très bon à bon marché, autant le service peut être extrêmement négligent et vous oublier. Les menus plastifiés ne sont pas vraiment propres. Certains plats sont très moyens en goût. L'hiver, l'entrée reste ouverte et un courant d'air froid vpus glace les pieds. Parfait pour une grosse faim après une journée de travail."}
{"text":"I had the classic beef noodle soup with medium-sized round noodles and it was pretty good. It's pretty packed in there at lunch and the tables are small, but that actually seems like a pretty appropriate atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't blink! You will walk pass this homemade noodle house! This place has limited seating as it is located above an Asian grocery market!  Talk about fresh veggies delivered to their door!  Well if you were walking slowly and notice a crowd standing at the window staring, you'd realize hand pulled noodles being put on for show!    Anyways, the noodles were delicious! Hand made, hand pulled noodles are the softest noodles you will ever get! We got the spicy beef noodles and let me tell you...the aroma just makes your mouth water! The tender beef combined in a savory broth, veggies and hand made noodles is the perfect dish for a cold wintery day! Heck, if I could, I would eat it everyday!!   You should not visit this little china town without making a stop at this noodle house!!!"}
{"text":"Noodles are fantastic and the portions are large. Came here and ordered the hand-pulled noodles with spicy beef. Noodles were cooked to perfection, not over-cooked, and spice level was perfect. Great place to go if you need something quick and tasty!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. The portions were huge, and the special.. noodles with beef, was delicious! The broth was amazing (get it spicy). At first I thought it was \"just\" good, but then it just got better as I ate it. It works so much better when you place all the noodles in a spoon full of broth. I also liked that they give you tea with tea leaves instead of that cheap, powdery stuff. The service is hectic and abrupt, but that wasn't unexpected for a place like this. The place is cramped though."}
{"text":"Great flavor and broth! Get the original Lan Zhou noodle, can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"????(LAN Zhou Pulled Noodles) has been growing in popularity &  sprucing up everywhere including this Montreal location.  Located in the Chinatown district of Montreal, locals & tourists alike are often seen lining up to get a taste of this new craze, since the place is very small & only a few tables are available; depending on the time of day, expect no less than 30 minute wait time. While awaiting, diners can enjoy the art of noodle hand pulling that dates back hundreds, if not thousands, of years, the chefs cook the noodles right in front of diners & mere spectators, so get your iPhone & S8+ ready to blog about the experience.  And if you're lucky enough to get a table, table sharing may be necessary if alone, the noodles cone in a HUMONGOUS size of soup bowl, the appearance looks enticing. When ordering, I had asked for \"??\" - I.e, Big Spicy, however, it wasn't hot at all. The noodle soup with beef tendons looked delicious, but the broth lacked the punch, especially considering the craze it has drawn. I thought the meats, combination of beef shank slices & tendons tasted better than the rest, again expectations were high due to its popularity seen by the daily long lines & social media reviews, so my experience was good, but not blown away, hence no 5 stars.  For those considering trying it, I'd do once just to get it off your culinary bucket list, but I wouldn't wait in line for more than half-an-hour. In Montreal, there are other better options such as Vietnamese Pho noodle soup, Schwartz' Montreal Smoked Meats, etc"}
{"text":"Soup is amazing and noodles are chewy and has nice texture! The salads aren't that good though. Would go here again for the soup and price :)"}
{"text":"The texture of the noodle was excellent. That tells me they had a master noodle maker making it. The soup was a bit bland by comparison. But they do not skimp on the portions with the noodles or the side dishes. Make sure you're hungry when you go."}
{"text":"Great noodles! Fun to watch them make the hand pulled noodles. Great people watching with the entrance to the grocery store below inside the restaurant. We had both types of beef noodles and they were both great. Cucumber salad a solid item as well. Tiny place with a lot of action."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a hole-in-the-wall kind of place. The restaurant is located above an underground grocery store and it's pretty small in size. It can get very cramped during peak hours. As soon as you walk in, you'll immediately be able to smell the savory homemade broth.  FOOD: Definitely one of my favorite places to go. The soups warms you up no matter what time of the year it is. You can choose the size and width of your noodles which is a cool feature. The noodles are all hand-pulled and you can watch them do so in the window. And of course, the soup is absolutely amazing and it tastes super authentic, I always look forward to coming here. Also, the portions are HUGE.  PRICE: It's very affordable. It's a fantastic price for the food that you're getting.  SERVICE: Staff is very efficient. They bring your meals to you quite quickly."}
{"text":"I had the beef tender ramen, the broth is really good, loved it! The portion of beef tender was generous as well. I asked for the wide noodle, but it was too soft, and got softer overtime in the soup. My husband ordered vegi ramen, the soup was very buttery. It didn't taste Chinese to me... The regular broth is much better in my mind. He had the regular narrow noodle, we both liked it better than the wide one."}
{"text":"Cash/debit only. The noodle is sooooooooo soft. I chose the small noodle size. A medium bowl of noodle can feed 2 women. So, be careful! They don't seem to have beverages choice, but you can go downstairs to the Asian supermarket to get yourself a coco drink."}
{"text":"Went here on Valentines for lunch after the spa. I had the small veggie noodle soup and my fiancé had a medium beef noodle soup(spicy). The portions are very big. I love how you can see the fresh hand pulled noodles being made while you're waiting.  The food? Sooo yummy! Loved my veggie noodle soup, the only thing I would change is to not add the seaweed salad. The noodles themselves were very good. My fiancé had lots to say about his spicy beef noodle soup. He said multiple times how \"amazing\" it was. And that he would rate 5/5. The next day I flew home and he went back to this restaurant alone to get the same thing because he loved it that much and said he will come back every time he comes back to Montreal."}
{"text":"I never knew a soup could be so flavorful! I had the spicy beef with wide flat noodles and it was amazing! Unless you are a competitive eating champion, I do not recommend getting a size larger than a medium. I had the small and it was almost too big to finish. If you're looking for delicious, fresh, cheap, filling food in Montreal, this is the place!"}
{"text":"If I have had not eaten so many places, I would recommend this place. But the tenderness of the soup, and the essence of noodles are both missing at this place.  location: in chinatown, adjacent to a market, this place is always compared with the other place, which sserves the same kind of noodles. the seats are fairly limited, that is to say that you have to wait in line until someone finished their food and then you can grab your seats and eat.  Food: they have three sizes of noodles. Small, medium and large. And you can choose the size of the noodles, and the thickness. In addition, you can choose how spicy you want the soup to be. I had medium, size 2 and less spicy for lunch. The portion is huge. I barely could finish it but I saw many men were eating large size. My \"OMG\" face is clearly showing towards them. I found the soup bit salty and I wished that I could add more spice into my soup to alleviate some saltiness. The noodle is less tendered and made me even miss more about China. I wanted to eat the real, autentihc one.  Price: small for 7? Medium for 10. Very pricy with regard to their qualities and limited other choices for lunch, and service quality.   Overall: although I probably won't be back in a while, I still do not recommend to come to this place. Why? It's just not worth to spend 10 dollars to eat something that is not that delicious. I 'd rather spend the same amount of money on Ramen than this."}
{"text":"For years, I have been going to G&D for my groceries. And every time, I wanted to stop and try out these freshly hand-pulled noodles, but for some reason, I'm always in a rush when doing groceries in Chinatown.  This past week, I finally had the time to wait in line (about 15 minutes at 2pm on a Sunday), and test this place out. Upon ordering, I was a bit disappointed because they were out of tea. The food, however, made up for it.  The \"salad\": the cucumber salad had a perfectly balanced, crunchy peanut/Sichuan peppercorn topping. Definitely worth ordering if you choose to get the \"combo\"  The noodles: The broth for the vegetarian noodles was better and richer than any vegetarian broth I've had at similar restaurants, and the noodles were just as fresh and springy as I had expected. The egg, on the other hand (which I had been excited for, given some of the reviews I had read), didn't have enough of a \"tea\" taste to it but it was okay, because I don't think I'd want that tea taste in my soup. In the future, I'd be interested to see if they could offer a vegetarian version of the beef noodle soup, because I feel like that would be amazinggg.  All in all, long lines but quick service, huge portions, tasty food, and at a good price."}
{"text":"I must admit, expectations were high b/c of all the rave reviews and after spending a cold, rainy day in Montreal, I was really, really looking forward to an awesome bowl of hot beef soup with hand pulled noodles.  The restaurant is a well run, smooth operation with limited options on the menu, good/excellent value, esp. with the combos, with each order made fresh and quickly with good service.  A sure fire recipe for success.  I'm not surprised they are popular - so, why disappointed?  In short, the food.  First, the noodles lacked the chewy goodness (\"kew-kew\") I would expect from fresh hand-pulled noodles.  A big bowl of noodles is only great if they are not soft.  In addition, the broth was watery - okay flavor but not at all rich in mouth feel.  Lastly, the beef, while tender, barely had any flavor.  The tea egg was good with a nice tea essence (vs soy). Will try a different hand-pulled noodle establishment next time."}
{"text":"I, along with the few who gave this place less than 4 stars, were drawn by the many praises of fellow Yelpers. Tasting is believing, and I honestly don't think this place deserves any more than 2 stars. Reasons:  1) The place is located in a corner section above a supermarket. Seating is extremely limited, like less than 40, and if you have a party of less than 4, you're likely to be seated with strangers in the same table. The wait can be atrocious.   2) The noodle: while it was made in front of me, I found it to be undercooked and not the true Lanzhou \"chewy\". It's OK, but seriously you can get better noodles in the supermarket below.   3) The soup stock: tasteless and salty, like someone took tap water, added beef stock and salt, and called it a day.   4) The beef: it was...okay.   The Lanzhou beef noodle place in Philly is way better, but driving 7 hours south is probably not in most people's interest for Lanzhou beef noodles."}
{"text":"Like everyone else I took the special beef noodle soup. The soups was excellent: the broth was perfectly balanced and tasteful. The noodles are freshly made: tasty and just thick enough. The beef is tender and fat enough as well. The medium size is huge, be aware! The device is nice only in English tho. I went during a cold night and I had to eat with my winter jacket on. The weird set up, some electric stairs going down to the grocery in the basement right in the middle of the place, makes it almost windy inside every time someone gets in or out. That's really the only bad comment I have because really for the price you get a real good soup!"}
{"text":"Hands down the most authentic Chinese noodle place in Montreal! Unfortunately you cannot sit comfortably here and chat with friends over hours, but fortunately it means even when it's crazy crowded with long line, you will get sitted within 15min.  Another cool thing about home-made noodle is that you get to decide how thick the noodles are as the chef is making them right next to you.  ps: check out the Chinese grocery store in the basement at the same time (to stock up cheaper coconut water and add some varieties to your vege consumption)"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with noodles and this is one of my favourite places to get my fix! It is above a grocery store and has very limited seating but the broth is delicious and full of flavour.  I love that I can pick the type of noodle I want and they make it to order!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm!!  We came at 8:45 because we arrived in Montreal late, but they still took us in! (They close at 9pm).  We order the neuilles jiazhiang (jiajiang men) and soupe de nouilles avec boeuf (noodle soup w/beef).  They were both delicious but I especially liked the jiazhiang men!  The edamame with takana (a japanese pickled vegetable) were good too.  The waiter also asked me if I was Japanese and wanted to practice his Japanese with me :)  Thumbs up for good food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and dad to try their hand pulled noodles. I was expecting more since reading all the great reviews on this place. We ordered a small bowl of the Lang Zhou beef noodles (medium) and a medium bowl of the beef tendon with large noodles. We also split the cucumber salad which was really delicious. I was expecting more kick but got a timid visit to my taste buds. I had to add quite a lot of the chilli sauce to my soup. It was good nonetheless. One thing. Both bowls had the same size noodles. I don't know if we got the medium or the large lol! Portions are HUGE! We could easily split a medium bowl for the three of us. Cheap fare for good eats. Not the best but still satisfying!"}
{"text":"Tres bon rapport qualité/prix Peu de choix , parfait pour ne pas se casser la tête et manger vite ! Mmmm"}
{"text":"Seriously delish! The broth is a balanced art, as it should  be for authentic ramen. Don't be afraid of the  tea eggs either. They are basically a boiled egg soaked in soy sauce. If you don't eat in Chinatown much, beware of of the portion size. Small is actually more than enough to fill you up & medium is enough for 2 full meals. Large will feed an army! Great food, cheap price & friendly staff. Ombiance is the one thing you wont find. Dinning room is a cramped hall over a grocery store, but once you taste the food, you won't care"}
{"text":"Authentic and tasty! Noodles are just right with beef broth and a tea egg! The service is surprisingly great given this is a very affordable place! Will definitely come back for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Freshly made noodles in a small little restaurant! Anyone can watch the masters at work right outside without entering! What a joy!!  This place is bustling with in-and-out's due to the Chinese grocery store downstairs.   The service is not amazing. The noodles are very cheap though for the size!!! Medium is more than enough for my petite stomach. Amazing value for lunch and dinner.  The noodles are above average, the soup is only ok. Overall a little bland for my taste. Beef wasn't that flavourful, it didn't soak up the soup enough."}
{"text":"Been here twice with the husband ever since he's moved to Montreal two months ago. This place satisfies our craving for authentic chinese noodles. Slightly expensive but comparable in quality to many noodle shops in Markham."}
{"text":"Food here is insane! The noodle, soup, beef are all super authentic and tasty. I haven't had such authentic Lan Zhou Handmade noodle for decade. Very happy here."}
{"text":"YUM!!! FIVE STARS. We came here mid-afternoon, around 2:00 PM on a Tuesday after a horrible dining experience our first night in Chinatown Montreal the evening before.   This place is comfy, hip -- wooden tables and chairs. A bit smaller for a noodle joint, but still very homey and \"cozy\", especially when it's 20 degrees F outside. There's a window in front of the restaurant where you can see the noodles being handmade from scratch from the outside. They make fresh noodles for each bowl ordered. It was very interesting to see how the dough was rolled, cut, simmered in broth -- all by hand. Note that there is a big stairwell to an underground supermarket in the middle of the store. Although some may say it takes away from the ambience, it didn't bother us too much!   The service - pretty above average. We were seated quickly, given hot tea and a pitcher of lemon water, and had our order taken right when we came in. Noted that it was a slow mid-week afternoon, so perhaps Friday and weekend nights are a bit more difficult to be seated in such a timely manner. Our order came out in about 15 minutes.  The food - EXCELLENT. There's only 3 options of which soup to order on their menu: a vegetarian option, a pork soup, and a beef soup. I ordered the beef soup -- their most popular one. They had 3 sizes: Small ($7.99), Medium ($9.99), and Large ($11.99). I ordered a Medium. They also give you the option of spicy or non-spicy. I had spicy.  The portions are HUGE. My medium bowl came out to be about 11\"-12\" in diameter. Lots and lots of noodles, broth was seasoned with spices and pepper, a handful of beef, steaming hot. The spoon they also give you is also very interesting (think stew soup instead of typical Asian soup spoon), and it was a GREAT meal. I was full afterward, and for the affordable price for such a large serving size -- I will definitely come here again and again next time in Montreal.   Final notes - The broth was flavorful, the noodles were very fresh, and the beef was great. I was extremely impressed by the efficiency of the service and, of course, the portions for the price. Five stars for a great, simple, and authentic dining experience.   Helpful tips - if you have a large appetite for meat, they offer \"extra\" beef (or any meat that comes with the soup you order) and \"extra\" noodles for an additional $2-3. My normal Medium bowl was more than enough for me, so it wasn't an issue at all! Furthermore, the \"spicy\" option is not too hot, for those who prefer a \"no sweat\" spice kick.  If you come to Chinatown Montreal, I really recommend dropping by this place by all means. I wish they would open one of these in the States, as I can see myself grabbing a handful of friends every weekend for lunch AND dinner. Hot, fast, and fresh. 5/5!!!"}
{"text":"I may be going against popular opinion here in leaving this review - likely because I travel in Asia a lot and have pretty high standards in this category of cuisine, but I'm not really a fan of this place. The food is just alright, the broth isn't too oily or watery but it doesn't have a lot of taste either. Similarly, the noodles are thicker than need be and don't have a particularly satisfying texture I often find in dishes with thick noodles (I.e. Hokkien mee). The price doesn't reflect what you can really get around this area, and the eating space is small and cramped, which seems cute and makes it seem busy and bustling until you're there on a rainy or snowy day and you're moving aside constantly to make space for people in wet coats passing you by all the time. I'd go here to give it a try, but if you're like me you might not be impressed."}
{"text":"I can't believe people are lining up for this place.  Its decent but not worthy of a long wait.  The noodles itself are good, broth fair and the beef was meh. Kind of what you find in pho.  The medium portion was massive amount of broth.  Service was not great.  I was sitting at bar and tough to get attention of server.    The other hand rolled noodle place I've been to many times (Shang's in Las Vegas) is way better in every respect, so maybe I'm jaded."}
