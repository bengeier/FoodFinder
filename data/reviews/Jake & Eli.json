{"text":"Went on a Thursday Night around 830. There were maybe 6 other tables filled in the whole place. They asked for my order right after I sat and I needed another min. 15 min late I had to ask a busser to get someone to take my order. Food came quick, but it was very under whelming. I got 3 BBQ shrimp ($14) and 4 Crab tots ($16). Both overpriced IMO. The tots were good but the shrimp was just 3 grilled shrimp with some BBQ squirted on top. They kept asking if I wanted more water, but they never came to refill. Just not the best experience all around."}
{"text":"Nice selection of whiskies and beers. Great bartenders. And the pork cracklings are amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow, thought it would be good.... frys n drinks came out in five minutes, sliders in ten. Then ask for a Prime rib dinner, wait for another 30 mins? How is this possible?
It's not the 60's and in Las Vegas there's hundreds of great restaurants and dining options. Give them another try tomorrow."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like walking or driving anywhere so thought I'd pop into the hotel restaurant to grab some food after a long day traveling. Prices seemed quite reasonable so went with an 8 oz filet with the three sides; wild
Mushrooms, seasonal vegetables, and sweet potato.
Also ordered a Manhattan to go with the steak. 
I always chuckle when servers offer a \"sauce\" for the steak as my first thought is that if it needs a sauce, it's not a good piece of meat. 
The presentation for every item is definitely minimalist (see photo) and laughed as the seasonal vegetables consisted of 3 pieces of asparagus with small pieces on ham cut and put on the plate. The sweet potato pur√©e and mushrooms were plentiful in their own bowls.
Cutting into the filet, I would say they were on the border of rare to medium rare which I much prefer over medium rare to medium so kudos to that. I wasn't too happy though when, after the first cut, the cut piece was still attached by sinew to the main piece in two different spots. While I was very pleased with the temperature, the taste wasn't there and for a couple of bites, it actually had a bit of a burnt taste which I assume is from searing it slightly too long. After the first two bites, I decided to add salt and pepper but that didn't have the enhancement effect I was hoping for.
All in all, the food was average and the drink was tasty. The service was very good so do want to commend them on that. 
If you want a good piece of meat, there are a plethora of options on the strip that would be much better than here but it fulfilled the role of getting some food in the belly."}
{"text":"This is such a nice suprise!! As a former regular of the old Max Casino here, Jake and Eli is a pleasant and refreshing change.  The staff friendly, the food excellent, the drinks awesome, and the place adds an element of class to the Westin.  There is an article out there on the internet that gives this place a bad wrap, that is totally unfounded and unfair.  Being a former regular,while I loved the old place, it was going downhill, not being taken care of and a certain element of society began hanging out there more and more.  The new place adds class, while still feeling comfortable dressing casually.  The black cherry Martini, totally awesome, and the chicken wings, excellent!!!  This is a \"must stop\" while in Vegas or staying at the Westin.  This is coming from a local."}
{"text":"Steak was excellent. Really tender NY strip Asparagus and mashed.. wife and I shared a 12 oz meal and were both satisfied on the fullness scale..was a great surprise for a hotel meal.. service was top notch as well.. if u like bread pudding... one of the best!"}
{"text":"The fried pig skins are so wonderful! Had to order 2 orderers. Also the chicken and waffles are great! Service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Attended a one day seminar the following day and I only stayed 1 night. Was too tired to explore other restaurants so I decided to try this restaurant located inside the Westin. Ordered clam Chowder and fish tacos with fries. Food was very good as well as the service. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"So glad renovations are done. Not too shabby.. I went to the new restaurant inside of the hotel \"Jake & Eli\". I ordered the wings that were not tossed in your traditional \"hot\" or \"buffalo wing\" sauce but they were still good and crispy."}
{"text":"Very good food and great drinks. The customer service here is awesome as well. I had the Kentucky Fried chicken sandwich and a drink made with cotton candy, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff. So nice to be here. This is inside the Westin Las Vegas hotel and is located where the casino used to be. Newly renovated and looks beautiful. They have less choices on their menu than the prior restaurant but it's delicious. I really enjoy the Bloody Mary from the bar too."}
{"text":"Good service and drinks but be prepared to get raked. HIGH PRICED DRINKS!!!
$12.75 for a long island ice tea 
Maggiano's happy hour has them for $6"}
{"text":"Brand new in hotel restuarant(Westin). Sat at bat and had some snacks and cocktails. We came in during a slow week so we were the only ones in bar or restuarant at 830pm.Very friendly staff and bartender. Snacks came out fast and hot"}
{"text":"Update : The business owners seem to be very responsive on Yelp . But responsive only on yelp , I  have seen 3 -4 more reviews about their pricing and quantity and quality of food some of them from Jan ( user Allison talks about 3 tiny shrimps ) , but just responding on Yelp and not on your prices and quality and service is just futile . I lost my money here and I want to recommend to all to save theirs , hey Vegas has no dearth of reasonable, good revive and good quality restaurants !"}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights and ate the buffet each morning and it was very good.  For dinner we had the Filet Mignon which is out of this world tender and juicy and the choice of 3 side dishes makes this $23 meal the best value anywhere.  My wife had an excellent Grey Goose martini while I had the \"not so old\" Fashioned which came in a smoke filled box with a strip of candied bacon!  Very good prices on the drinks by the way."}
{"text":"For some reason there's a lot of hype regarding this new restaurant-- I found it awesome possum for the service and very reasonable for the buffet breakfast which included everything from an omelette station to smoked salmon to gluten-free bread. The waitstaff was impeccable, caring, kind, and so on top of it.

Thoroughly enjoyed the hot water with lemon, orange juice, and ice water plus whatever else we needed, they brought with a big smile and politeness. It's quite relaxing eating here in a booth with the trendy lamps and mirrors around, sort of reminded me of the atmosphere of hipster Portland. I could lounge here for hours..and just relax in conversation."}
