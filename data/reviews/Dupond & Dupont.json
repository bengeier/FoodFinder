{"text":"My favorite brunch spot. Wonderful menu with broad selection of fresh, tasty food. Each trip to Montreal includes at least one visit. After your sit down breakfast be sure to grab some fresh baked bread and pastry from the bakery. Not a fan of the coffee but it isnt bad. I suppose coffee is particular to each person but it wasn't a fit for me. Recommend without hesitation.  Grab an outside table if you can for a peaceful outdoor eating experience."}
{"text":"Breakfast on weekends are one of the best! Their grilled cheese is to die for. Service is a little bit slow but you shouldn't be in a rush to have breakfast. Kind of pricy but worth the price!"}
{"text":"Very nice, very clean, good prices, yummy baked goods and I loved the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch...busy and bustling - like that!  Always a good sign. Service was fine.  Waitress was busy but was skilled and provided decent service.  

I can only comment on my meal - sesame salmon salad.  The salmon was great - about 3-4oz and it came sitting in a bed of spinach, peppers, and noodles coated with a teriyaki dressing.  My only complaint was that it was drenched!  It was almost like a spinach, pepper, noodle soup.  Hard to tell if there was oil in the sauce but some shiny looking bubbles made me thing that there was an oil in the dressing.  Trying to watch my caloric intake, I left a lot on the plate.  My mistake - I should have requested the dressing on the side.

A good salad!

My only caveat!!! Check your teeth when done! The little sesame seeds will hide between your teeth! :).

My co-guests enjoyed some nice looking, decent portion meals. Prices were reasonable.

Lots of locals to this great place where I grew up! I remember the days when it used to be a bank!"}
{"text":"My Uncle took me here one early morning during my visit with him in Montreal.   This Dupond Dupont we went to is located in the Town of Mount Royal.   He was eager to take me here as he enjoyed a great cup of morning coffee and croissant.   The actual bakery I believe is called Premiere Moisson, and boy... I did not realize what a treat I was in for.   This is one thing we don't see much in Southern California, a boulangerie or a cafe bakery.   I simply had there house blend cup of coffee and my Uncle their cappucino.  The coffee was strong, flavorful Columbian brew, very good.  The real treat was the croissant, when picking up the croissant, I observed their other assortment of fresh baked breads, it was awesome to see the rich color, textures and aroma of these breads so early in the morning, and perfect timing, a fresh batch of croissants had just been rolled out.   We sat down at a window table and it was an early bright Montreal morning.   A sip of the coffee.... ahh... mmm... good.  Then came the bite of the perfectly golden browned croissant, Ultra thin crust, yet very fluffy and light interior.  The warm, buttery, flaky, texture and taste of the croissant was heavenly.   I could not believe how great of a croissant it was, now I know what a croissant should taste like and how it should be, this is hands down the best croissant I ever had, I give kudos to the French on this for sure!   Once again, another positive experience in French, Quebec.... see inspite of what some people think I wrote about my other experiences, it wasn't all bad over there.   Dupond & Dupont/Premiere Moisson,  5 stars to you all!"}
