{"text":"I come here quite often.
Delicious, but not spicy enough.
Which is understandable due the local client√®le.
Authentic Caribbean food are by default more spicy."}
{"text":"Nice little joint with good Caribbean food. I tried the Jerk Chicken Roti the first time and it wasn't that great - it was missing the gravy. But I can understand why they may have opted not to include the gravy inside a roti.

Glad I gave them another chance and tried the Jerk Chicken with rice and peas. I will be back."}
{"text":"Had better, nothing special. Chris jerk on birchmount is better. The meat was so dry."}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken in town, good atmosphere and well respected. Will come again for more times"}
{"text":"I got here because of the line formed outside.. I found out later that the place is on Yelp so I am writing a well deserved review

I had the Curry chicken with rice and potato 
the portion is good for lunch, they offer also a larger portion as a dinner plate

the Chicken was spicy as needed moist and the rice was done excellent, although some heat was required which can be added via pepper sauce on the tables (carefully !) 
price is reasonable for lunch on the go 

the only reason not to get 5 stars is that this is a self serve type of place were you pick up the food and pay and than look for place to seat 

I will definitely be back to taste the Ox Tail.!!"}
{"text":"I was dissatisfied w/ the jerk chicken. I feel bad for leaving one star, so I've rounded up out of sympathy. With such few Caribbean restaurants in the area, I expect more."}
{"text":"Food was great. I had the chicken roti which was perfect. Just the right amount of flavour and heat. Restaurant could use some renovations."}
{"text":"I am there at least 3,4 times a week, great place some meals, rice is steamed, chicken is tasty"}
{"text":"Went: 6:00 pm Wed June 10 2015 (11th couple date)
Ordered: Small Oxtail Dinner and Small Jerk Chicken Dinner
Cost: incl. tax and tip $20
Comments: We liked the oxtail more and found it delicious, though the Jerk Chicken was very good as well. There is background music which sometimes takes away from the conversation if too loud, but it was okay here. The portion sizes were generous and the price is very reasonable.
Bottom line: I would definitely come back. Reasonable prices. Delicious food."}
{"text":"I had this for a corporate catered lunch today. Oh my golly! So damn tasty. Everything was so damn tasty.

The jerk chicken was flavourful and moist. The jerk pork was addictive. The coleslaw was stellar. The roti was tender and pliable. 

I do not have one complaint at all. I will definitely be coming to this place in future for more delicious food. 

Very great delivery and set-up service too!"}
{"text":"Got jerk fat, er I mean jerk pork take out.They chopped me all fat pieces. Seriously ?!"}
{"text":"I'm mixed on this one. I arrived around 2:30 in the afternoon to order a late lunch to take back to the office. The place wasn't too busy and the lady who was working there put down the broom to take my order: a chicken curry roti. After taking my order, the lady went back to sweeping. A few minutes elapse and my roti came out of the kitchen in a styrofoam box. The lady put down her broom and packaged it into a bag, along with a knife and fork. This is all fine and all, except she didn't wash her hands.

After arriving back at the office, I grabbed some clean cutlery and dove in. The roti itself is BIG, filling out the entire container. Flavourwise, there is a satisfying blend of saltiness, curriness, and spiciness (be sure to ask for hot sauce). The potato to chicken ratio is close to even, although more sauce would not have been unwelcome. I ate about two thirds, and continued to pick away at the remainder throughout the day. While the roti became consistently drier the longer it sat on my desk, each bite was still full of flavour.

Hygiene issues aside, I would probably return."}
{"text":"It was hard to know what to expect from here since there's not much on Yelp, so friends decided to go in blind. The actual restaurant is tucked out of view across from the Country Style. 

Goat roti was delicious with chickpea filling, and a fresh tasting roti which really makes the dish, as many other jerk places manage to just get the filling right. 

Didn't try the jerk chicken but looked good, and friend said it had sufficient time marinating unlike Tastee's. Jerk pork was ok, nothing special. Ox tail stew wasn't stewed long enough so it was hard to eat, but the pieces were of sufficient size. I'm guessing they just made it recently so your mileage may vary on tenderness. 

They also have an assortment of locally made drinks including Irish Moss (tastes like Vanilla pudding; disgusting) and beet juice (exactly what it sounds like so ok by me). They also have a good beer selection and ginger beer so it's well stocked. 

Would go again, simply because it's a take out style ordering place with a great sit down area and live music Friday nights. Food and prices about on par with other Jamaican places but much better ambience."}
{"text":"Right off the bat let me say this place is great, tasty Caribbean food, friendly staff, down right authentic taste. Combined with a liquor licence and patio space, this place is great during the warm season.

They have a small specialized menu with all your favourites. The food is well spiced and full of flavour, which is necessary because you'll be eating it with rice, beans, or roti. They have great daily lunch specials, and nice choice of sides.

It's hard to find such a place this far north from Toronto."}
{"text":"One further update... My original review provided only 4/5 stars because of the temperature of the chicken I had that day. I've had it twice since and it's been perfect each time. Nicely done Cravins, a well-deserved 5 stars for you."}
{"text":"Was hungry and stuck in the area because I had to wait for my car to be serviced, and stumbled upon Cravins Caribbean Grill.  I wasn't in the mood for fast food or Chinese, so i thought I'd give it a try.  The place is hidden on the corner of a plaza/office space.  The place was pretty big inside and had old school reggae coming out of a big speaker.  Conscious tings.  Wanted the ox tail meal, but the don't serve on Saturday's.  Ordered the jerk chicken meal. Came with a nice portion of rice and pease and coleslaw.  The chicken was nice, juicy and lots of flavor.  Not too spicy. Ordered a red stripe to get back to my roots.  In my way out I wanted a peanut punch, but the were all out.  The nice lady at the counter recommended an Irish Moss. She said \"it's good fi you\".  It was nice and cold. Tasted like a sweet pudding milkshake. Good find to pass an hour."}
{"text":"Had the goat curry..was boneless tender and very flavourful...came with side of coleslaw and flavourful rice. Coconut water added nicely to this dish"}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian roti. Flavourful and right amount of spice. They offer quite a few options for veggie roti but I always ask for a mix of everything and they have always happily complied. Bonus points for that. Very cheerful and welcoming service. 

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0

Ordered their Jerk Chicken dinner plate which had a very generous portion of rice. The chicken was moist and flavourful. Some folks may find it a bit too spicy but I definitely enjoyed the kick! The coleslaw was crisp and light on the dressing which fits my preference. 

If you don't plan on getting yourself into a food coma for the rest of the day, I recommend splitting it with another person which was just the right amount for lunch."}
{"text":"Very BAD CUSTOMER Service. Especially the girl that stays on the front desk. She very RUDE"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place so many times but never noticed it.  It's quite good and very flavorful.  We got takeout and I had the ox tail stew on rice with a side of curried mango.  The mango was really spicy.  I can normally handle a bit of spice too.  My husband had chicken roti and found it spicy too...but he normally can't handle his spice anyway.  

Would definitely come back next time I have a cravin!  ;)"}
{"text":"Hi,

I just want to thank the staff at Cravins on behalf of our team at Lorex. We ordered twice from you over the holidays and both times the food was fresh made and delicious. On top of the quality of food, I must add is the service provided by the team at Cravins. I had the pleasure of dealing with Tamara- who helped me with everything from food selection , budgeting and proportioning the meals. This was to feed very large group of people. She assisted me twice and both times were quite a success with our company. She is a valued asset to your team. 

We will always have Cravins in mind for future catering. I will also be posting this on my Yelp account to inform others of how easy it is to deal with cravins for a not so easy task.

Thanks a lot,

Shaheed S."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and wasn't impressed after so much Talking about this place. Food, rice and peas are overcooked, chicken seems like jerk sauce was put on top, very white inside and no jerk flavour. Looks like the chicken was NOT marinated. Col saw is the worse I ever had, so watery!!! Definetly food needs to be improved!!! A jerk plate is $10 will prob not come back again"}
{"text":"Really good food. Had the curry goat which was boneless. Full of meat and flavor! Really happy with that! Husband had the jerk chicken. It wasnt spicy and full of flavor. Wasn't too dry. Really liked their coleslaw though. The person who greeted us was really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"The food did not taste good.  The service was slow and worker had attitude problem.  But the back to the food, I made better jerk at home with the stuff i get from no frills.  Rice was mushy and just bad.  I went here bc of descent reviews not sure who is giving this place positive reviews."}
{"text":"the place is very hidden, can not see it from woodbine, i had to drive around the plaza to find it.
it's mainly for take out or you can order and then sit down (lots of seats)
the stuff did not look fresh at 1:30pm maybe it's the end of lunch already? the food was a bit warm but not hot.

the rice was really hard and the chicken pieces are really big.
i got the curry potato side.
Im not sure what it is, the rice, the chicken or the potatoes or everything but it is soooo spicy, way to spicy for me and i can eat spicy food."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've eaten here. I get the feeling that it's gone through another change of ownership. Service was non existent. Portions seemed larger than before but our meals tasted like the days reheat.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Awesome roti!!
I am a vegetarian and the owner provided me a chana roti with potatoes. If you love Roti hut, you will love this place even more!!!! 

If you are in Markham go here !!!"}
{"text":"Great spot, got the vegetarian roti, not to much sauce just the right amount so the the roti doesn't get soggy. My friend got the chicken roti and he said the chicken was nice and soft and the beef patty had a soft buttery base. Best beef patty he had so far. Definitely come back again! BLESS"}
{"text":"This place is more like a cafeteria style restaurant. It's great for people who work and simply just want to pay upfront, eat and then go. Staff are nice and place is clean. Great selection of sides to choose from, with options like spinach, curry potatoes and chickpeas. Jerk chicken and gravy both together to really well with each other with just a tinge of spiciness. Enjoyed their $6.89 lunch special which gave a whole leg, rice, side and a pop. Definitely my go to area for Carribean food in Markham!"}
{"text":"So delicious!  I got the goat curry with peas and rice and curried potatoes. I asked for two hot sauces on the side.. it's so delicious!  And yes, absolutely spicy. :)  I'm dinging one star because the wait was kind of long, but if you're not in a rush this place was just fantastic. I wish I were local."}
{"text":"Love their jerk chicken and the sides that it comes with ! Definitely going back to try the goat roti."}
{"text":"I've eaten the curried goat and oxtail a lot from here.   In the last couple of months the quality has gone down and portion sizes are smaller.   The curry goat is very oily and the meat dry.  I don't know if they're cutting corners or using poorer quality meats but both oxtail and goat standard has dropped.   I go the extra distance to a jerk place off Vic Park."}
{"text":"Just tried this today for the first time and the reviews are spot-on. By far the best jerk chicken in the area 9 dollars for a jerk chicken lunch special and it came with seasoned rice and beans, coleslaw and spicy gravy on top. Quality of the chicken is great and flavour is great. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Not the best Caribbean food I've had but it's not terrible. I wouldn't go back again unless we just wanted anything to eat quick. 
I had the jerk chicken & rice w/ beans."}
{"text":"I don't have a lot of Caribbean eats so this review is just based off what I think of this restaurant in no comparison to any others. 

My work place is close by, so we order here all the time for lunch. The staff here are friendly, and orders are always right. We love getting the Monday and Wednesday lunch specials (Jerk Chicken and Jerk Pork respectively)

The jerk chickens got a bit more of a kick to it, while the pork has more of a mild, home comfort flavour. I usually get these with a side of slaw. I love their creamy, light slaw. :) You can always try their potatoes too!! Everything's packed with flavour and it's a good value."}
{"text":"I've tried many jerk meats in the GTA and have yet to be satisfied with their flavour and spice. I've had some amazing jerk chicken from Jamaica so I think my standards are pretty high. The 3 times I've visited Cravins I only had their lunch special ($6.89) which is usually stew chicken with a side, rice, and a drink. Which is a great deal! The rice wasn't dry like most rice and peas are. The spinach, which I usually get, was good for my health conscious self and is also well seasoned with thyme. The stewed chicken wasn't anything to phone my Jamaican uncle about but today they featured their jerk pork!

I didn't expect much because of the sub par jerk I've been having in the area but to my surprise Cravins jerk was a good slap on the tongue of spiciness and filled my mouth with that distinct jerk flavour. It's a good swift slap that doesn't linger, like wasabi. It's not overly pungent either with hints of all spice, and peppers. It's a perfect balance. The pork itself was lean but still juicy. There's also some jerk gravy you can mix with your rice. They must've slow cooked the pork in the jerky seasoning because the flavour penetrates to the inside as well. Unlike other places where the flavour is only on the outer layer of the meat. It's also a hefty handful of pork, well worth it for the quality and amount."}
{"text":"Recently craving roti, I like B&B Roti and Jerk but it's a little far, so I decided to try something closer.

This little roti restaurant is located on woodbine just south of Denison and has their own parking spots for their customers, along with a small patio for the ones who want to eat outside.

I ordered a goat and chicken roti. The goat roti tasted average, I've tasted better, the meat tasted pretty fresh but everything else like the outside shell and everything else inside didn't taste really fresh. The same goes for the chicken. It wasn't horrendous nor did it knock my socks off, I'd rate it as average. 

3/5."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday during lunch hours at about 12:30pm and there was already a line up. This is like a food court style restaurant where you place your order at the counter and the food is served to you on an actual plate or take-out container. You pay right at the counter when they give you your food and you go find your own table. There is a fair amount of seats for dine-in but I got mine to go. 

Jerk chicken rice and peas (lunch size $7.89) - no complaints here. You get 3 pieces of tender chicken. Didn't taste overly salty like at other places. Coleslaw went well with the meal. Lunch size may not be enough for people with larger appetites like me. 

Chicken roti $7.69 - huge meal with lots of boneless chicken. Mostly dark meat which I liked. The curry sauce was excellent and with a little hot sauce this roti meal really goes a long way. Loved the curry chicken roti."}
{"text":"The place was amazing when the original owners were running the place. Ever since the food has changed but the biggest difference is the customer service and organization of the joint. The food is still pretty good and great for a work break however the workers are careless and forgetful. The last 4 times I've gone there they made a mistake. One time they told me my food was coming repeatedly and only to tell me that they ran out of jerk chicken after 30 min. Beware if you go, have low expectations!"}
{"text":"So happy I found this place! Delicious, quality food, generous portions, very reasonable prices. And a really lovely atmosphere, including a patio."}
{"text":"Ordered a Curry Goat Dinner with Rice and Peas and Potatoes for take-out, $13

Goat wasn't tender enough, curry flavour was ok.. Order my goat bone-in option, got about 6 small pieces bone-in and a couple of small pieces meat only, noticed I used the word small.. Meat portion wasn't enough and definitely less then other caribbean places.  

For the rice and peas, I usually ask for extra curry on top - which I think is pretty much standard for these types of food. Forgot to this time, waitress didn't ask, which they usually do.. Rice and peas didn't work out for me.. I would say it was average.. But without extra curry on-top, it's just missing something at the end of the day. 

Potatoes was not bad, but a bit gooey, but that's because they use for rotti orders.. 

I would say they give high portions or rice and potatoes tho.. Couldn't finish my dinner.. Which i usually do..

The service wasn't there either.. Waitress didn't seem like she cared.. I'm pretty sure she was manager or owner level..

Can't say I would recommend this place for take-out.. But the patio looked pretty sweet.. If you're looking for this type of take-out, check Chris Jerk at Birchmount and Huntingwood!"}
{"text":"I'm a pesca vegetarian so I have only eaten veggie or seafood things here. But their roti is so good and fresh, not too thick. My friends get the chicken or goat etc.. And really like it. The staff are super warm and friendly too!"}
{"text":"That was fast!!!!!

Soooo, was here a few months back and am not sure if the whirlwind of great reviews over stacked the place's confidence too much that they forgot what really sells..... CONSISTENT QUALITY.

Very disappointing, maybe it was 2 off days that lead to this review but purchasing chicken that is not fresh two weeks apart is enough for me to say that this place sells two-day old or olderrrr jerk chicken. Not cool! Especially for the price of $8+ for the medium and $9+ for the large.

Prior to ordering, I think it's best to request for fresh chicken cooked the same day. This way you get what you pay for. This is why Rap's is set apart on a different level of jerk chicken fresh off the grill.

This place will stay in business because of the industrial area it's surrounded by and that's it! Not a place I'd ever return to again."}
{"text":"Nice Caribbean restaurant in Markham! It is located in the plaza at the northwest corner of Woodbine and Steelcase. It's a little hidden but it's really close to the country style. They have weekday specials which is about $1 off from the regular price. Bottled water comes with the specials. 

I ordered the jerk chicken for lunch (take out). Got 2 pretty big pieces of chicken, rice, beans, and coleslaw as my side. The sauce was moderately spicy. Didn't burn my mouth all that much but if you can't really handle spice, maybe you should tell them to hold on the sauce. It was all very delicious and quite filling. Chicken was tender and I was told the coleslaw is really good but I found it so so. Wish I got more beans though but that isn't something that will stop me from returning :)

The ladies serving at the counter were friendly and the place works sort of like a food court. You order your food, pay, then you can take a seat anywhere."}
{"text":"My company catered from Cravins a handful of time, and each time the food quality has always been great! Their must haves are: jerk chicken, jerk pork, rice and peas and coleslaw (just to name a few).

This Christmas, my company is catering Christmas lunch from Cravins. The wonderful surprise was Shawn (I suspect is the owner) actually came to our office to drop off a thank you gift for being their customer, and to wish us a Merry Christmas! Talk about awesome customer service and attention to detail!

We are all happy customers of Cravins at Marketcircle :)"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for jerk chicken or oxtail. The portions are very large and the food is not dry like many other places. The level of spice is just right. The staff at the restaurant are super friendly. They also have a nice outdoor seating area on beautiful days."}
{"text":"I was disappointed that I couldn't try their jerk chicken with rice. But I had it in the wrap and it was okay. A lot of potatoes, decent flavour. Very good service - polite and quick."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and had jerk chicken and pork was really good and the gravy on the rice was great! The food was very tasty and the meat was so moist and the rice was tasty. I liked the multiple options of sides as I don't always love coleslaw. I think lunch time is the best time to go, we went closer to closing time one day and the menu options were more limited as is the be expected (our bad)."}
{"text":"This review of Cravins Caribbean Grill is based on their take out food alone.

3.5 Star for the Jerk Chicken which really have some heat from the dry rub! The portion for dinner size is decent with quite a few piece of chicken. 

I did not enjoy Oxtail Dinner as much as the pieces were mostly bones but have a good flavour.

Good to have a decent Caribbean Restaurant for take out in the Markham area and Cravins' food is definitely quite solid.

Would be back for lunch for more Jerk Chicken!"}
{"text":"Great authentic food. Got a full plate of jerk chicken which tasted perfect along with some pumpkin and spinach on the side. Very filling for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Been searching for a Roti place near work. Great spot good food had the goat roti , loved it. It's a little hidden from the road so don't miss it."}
{"text":"Good jerk spot, personally better than tasty jerk around corner. Daily special is cheap and it comes with drink.
Jerk chicken is my favourite with slaw"}
{"text":"We got take out: oxtail and goat curry. Oxtail was very delicious; falling off the bones and full of flavour. Goat curry has good kick too. I had to take off a star as the coleslaw was sugary sweet and saucy. Could use some extra rice with the entree. 
Overall very good Caribbean dishes. Will return"}
{"text":"It was our first time here last night and it definitely did not disappoint! First we were greeted so pleasantly and not knowing how and where to order the young lady happily helped us. The food was bombbbbdiggity. I ordered the oxtail stew with rice and peas and slaw and husband ordered the jerk chicken roti. Spiiiicey but absolutely satisfied my palette and craaaaaaving for some authentic and tasty carribean food. Both meat options were perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked tender. Def coming back here again and glad we dont have to go to Scarboro for our carribean food fix!!!"}
