{"text":"Very meticulous with his work! Despite it being time consuming with many pieces, Dave did a very good job putting my dresser together. it is sturdy and the drawers slide smoothly. Glad he came, because I wouldn't have got it done in weeks."}
{"text":"I can be a pretty demanding customer., especially with the stress of buying a new house coupled with a new job in the same week. Dave helped to make things a little less stressful. 

I called him on a Tuesday to do a difficult ceiling fan install on 14 ft high vaulted ceilings. He was there Wednesday afternoon and did everything that was required to get it done. Whoever build my house/did the wiring did a half assed job that rivaled DMV customer service. Dave worked under the light if a headlamp, cut into drywall, went to a hardware store, rewired the entire system, and then installed the second one. He was there for over 4 hours and kept us informed the whole way through. He stayed over 4 hours, until the job was completed. 

After that we had a conversation with him where he have us insider knowledge on what plumbers charge (ever heard of a trip charge? That's where you pay some clown to come out to tell you he can't fix something). I will be using nick for this home and every other property I own. He even charged us less than quoted and wouldn't take my cash when I tried to pay extra. I'll have to find a way to sneak it in to payment for other jobs!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best handyman I've ever worked with! Dave is strictly a one man operation, so you work with him and only him from first contact to job completion. He's friendly, courteous, respectful, a good communicator, prompt, tidy and a tremendous hard worker. I hired him for 10 hours of furniture assembly (lots of furniture assembly!), and he was on task, focused, and working hard the entire time. I also felt very comfortable having him in my home. I couldn't have asked for better, and I will absolutely be calling on him again!"}
{"text":"Wow, great handyman! Not a \"service,\" Dave's a good, old-fashioned handyman, the one you hope you'll find but seldom do these days. Best rates (shown up-front on his website), easy to book, arrives on time, works meticulously and with a smile, gives money-$aving advice. Finished everything on my extensive list in two surprisingly short visits. I am one happy camper!"}
{"text":"Dave was amazing. Very professional, on-time and got my doggy door installed in no time. Even has a paypal account for people like me that doesn't carry any cash and forgets to stop by the ATM. We'll probably hire him again for all those pesky little house projects."}
{"text":"Great guy came to my house to fix a leaky pipe and fixed a few other items. Easy to work with and accepts pay pal payments. Clean, efficient and honest. I will defiantly use him and recommend him again."}
{"text":"I asked Dave to save me from a series of chronic irrigation leaks; he was happy to do it, and also helped me with another couple of outdoor projects. Great guy to work with!"}
{"text":"Dave is so professional, informative and easy to do business with.   He arrived on the dot for our scheduled appointment.  He was very polite as he introduced himself and asked that we take a quick tour to review all the projects to be addressed.  

As we went through everything on my list Dave was upfront about a couple of things he could not take on.   I so appreciate his candor, because I've had too many experiences with service providers who can't deliver on work they said they could handle.  

Dave patched a couple of holes in my laundry room ceiling, installed two new bathroom light bars, installed a chandelier with ceiling medallion, hung curtain rod and a mirror.  He also changed the battery in a smoke detector that is too high for me and my regular height ladder.

His prices are very reasonable.  His service is first rate.  Will definitely use him again."}
{"text":"Dave's the best.  We found him when moving and he fixed up all of the things on the home inspector's list and did an exceptional job.  I always took good care of our house in Tempe, but it was never in better shape than the day we moved out.  Dave is very thorough and meticulous and does everything right the first time.  Since moving we've hired him another time to install a ceiling fan.  Normally I would do this myself but the ceiling was 19ft tall and I didn't want to deal with it, but a piece of cake for the maestro.  Seems to be very knowledgeable about everything from electrical to plumbing, to everything around the house, so great number to have when needed."}
{"text":"5 starts Service!!!!

I recommend for everyone who needs handymen 
To use his services"}
{"text":"I'm a Dad to a 19 year going to college at ASU and am miles away so I had the luxury of trying to find a handyman to put together her desk and desk chair. 

I wanted to make sure anyone I hired to go into my daughters apartment with me mikes away, I vetted and made sure they were whom they said they were and I could trust them as much as I could being I was miles away. 

I decided to go with Handyman Dave and sent him an message through his website as that was the only form of contact I could find for him. 

It was a challenge scheduling an appointment with this handyman. The communication was awful and all was done by email as I preferred speaking with him. But that didn't happen. He emailed me to say he called me and it went to a business and that made him nervous. That was a very strange email comment and this really made the antennas go up. He didn't leave a voice message. I emailed him back to see if we could try to connect again and I could get a feel of a guy that would be going into my 19 year old daughters apartment but he didn't respond and it's then I knew this wasn't the guy I could trust. If he wasn't willing to call me back to make me feel comfortable to let him into my daughters apartment, then it confirmed what I was feeling, this wasn't the handyman for me. If you're going to let someone into a place where you lay your head then he/she should know to make the potential customer comfortable.  

His excuses for not answering his phone:

He said he doesn't answer his phone because he doesn't want to cut into his customers time and because if sales people. That's understandable but as a new customer wanting to schedule an appointment with him, it was a bad experience. 

This was an awful experience and it went on for a week. 

If the service man isn't willing to make you feel comfortable enough to let them into your home, are they deserving enough to be hired? Probably not."}
{"text":"Dave was courteous, professional, and fixed a plumbing issue for a fraction of the cost a competing plumbing company I found on Yelp wanted to charge. I'm relatively mechanically inclined myself, but was stumped finding the root cause of a leak coming from my bathtub. The leak seemed to stem from the drywall, and I knew I was going to need to hire a professional. I called Dave in the morning, and he came to my house same day and was able to quickly solve what could have been a serious plumbing issue in under an hour. I'm not one to usually write reviews, but after such great customer service I'm going to recommend to all my homeowner friends. A+ Service, Quality, and Price."}
{"text":"Dave has become my go-to guy for everything handyman. He is the definition of reliable, professional, knowledgeable and customer service oriented. I could never recommend him enough. I live in an older home and have had cause to call upon him several times. He always is great with communication and is an absolute pleasure to do business with, not to mention more than fair in his pricing. I'll never go to anyone else!"}
{"text":"Excellent! I so appreciate how Dave was able to fix our leaky sink within a couple hours of my call. It was a pretty easy valve replacement (but not so easy that I wanted to do it myself). Dave is really customer and safety oriented and offered preventative tips as well. Guaranteed his work and rate was very reasonable. Thanks Dave!"}
{"text":"Courteous, genuine, and professional service. Dave completed a complicated closet door job I was struggling to get anywhere with and even taught me a few things along the way. His price seems fair and I wouldn't hesitate to use his services again!"}
{"text":"I had Dave back to fix a slow-moving sliding glass door. He removed the door and replaced the wheel apparatus. Now the door works perfectly. (It whirs when I use it. Sometimes I open and close it just to hear the sound.)

He also cleaned a stained wall. I thought it would have to be repainted, but he cleaned it with solvent. You cannot tell it was ever stained.

Dave is an excellent handyman. Just follow his instructions on his Web site to contact him. It amazes me that anyone would have trouble with him."}
