{"text":"A gem in Scottsdale recommended to us by a friend.  Every dish came out quickly and was fresh and delicious.  We ordered tuna tartare, a special roll wrapped in cucumber and a rainbow roll with spicy yellowtail inside.  De-lic-ious!  We eat sushi often and this is one of my favorite places.  I swear their wasabi tastes better than other restaurants, I can't get enough!  When we were leaving, every single employee turned to say \"Thank you,\" it was such a charming place.  Next time, my fiance and I will sit at the sushi bar, they have some pretty amazing creations!"}
{"text":"Very fresh & tasty sushi at a good price.  Atmosphere was fine & the service was excellent.  We both enjoyed our food & dining experience at Toyama"}
{"text":"Toyoma is all about the Sashimi. Decor is nothing.  No loud rock music blasting while rolls with too much sauce to cover up the mediocre fish are served.  This is all about thinly sliced Sashimi for those that appreciate just the best Sushi/Sashimi around.  Fartig."}
{"text":"All you need to know: FRESH fish. This is my new favourite spot for authentic sushi. I will be back weekly. I love the chopped wasabi and the Toyama Roll was delicious. The salmon and tuna sashimi were incredibly fresh, the salmon was especially good and sweet. I can't wait to to try more of the menu. Friendly and helpful staff as well. Arigat?. (I loved this place so much I was inspired to write yelp review, something I've never done before.)"}
{"text":"Toyama has two wonderful Sushi chefs (Mo & Giro) who remember you by name and offer great \"off the menu\" selections if you request chefs choice. I highly recommend Toyama for their great rolls and sushi. They have the freshest sushi around and their wait staff is very attentive...so much better than the \"other guys\"."}
{"text":"Yes! Great fantastic sushi here. We had about 12 different items from the menu, even the sea urchin was amazing. We had tuna, salmon, etc rolls in different forms and mixed with different ingredients as well as the shrimp dumplings which we loved loved very much. We took some tools to go (we were staying at a hotel near by) so our friends there could try some sushi as well! Customer service is outstanding. Prices are just right."}
{"text":"We headed out for a nice evening of Sushi and left very disappointed.  We were in and out within an hour.  The first thing that met us was a very inattentive waiter, the seemed to not have time for our questions about the menu.  We ordered our edamame and after the recognizable \"ding\" from the microwave our order arrived.  It was sitting in luke warm water and was wilted.  No salt on top or even on the side for our own taste.  We ordered the Poke Salad that came on a bed of really wilted lettuce, not even on the tradition bed of seaweed.  It was topped with nuts too.....mind you, there was no mention of nuts on the menu in the description of the salad.  I feel sorry for anyone with allergies to Nuts.  The portion of fish on the salad was the smallest I've ever seen.  Needless to say it was promptly returned.  Finally our rolls came.  They had to be the smallest pieces of sushi I have EVER seen, and again really unappealing to the sight.  The last insult of the night had to be the worst.  When we left the restaurant we were immediately met by the smell of trash and rotten fish that had just been taken out.  Perfect ending to a very unpleasant evening!"}
{"text":"Best quality fish in the valley! I love visiting and sitting at the bar and learning all there is to know about sushi from the owner and managing partner. Absolute favorite place, expensive ... But you pay for the quality.   If you don't appreciate good fish you wouldn't know how to appreciate Toyoma."}
{"text":"Incredibly overpriced and the fish was not fresh. The poke salad was about $17 and had a few pieces of spinach and maybe an oz of fish. Spent over $350 for s group of 6 and we were all starving when we left. Waiter was rude and we were there over 2 hours even though we made a reservation. Save yourself some money and just get some sushi at Whole Foods."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous celebration dinner at Toyama tonight.  There were fourteen in our party, including four children. We preordered because of the kids, and everything was served promptly and beautifully.  And it was all over the top delicious.   Thanks Toyama for making a special night perfect!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten sushi outside of the Phoenix area, but still feel safe in saying that Toyama has the best sushi in Arizona.  In fact it stands right up there with the best sushi I've had in Japan.  Their fish is always incredibly fresh and consistent, unlike other (usually very good) restaurants.  If you're in the mood for something cooked, the saikyo yaki is really outstanding and goes very well with a glass of sake. Chef Mo and his wife Mimi are incredibly warm and friendly, and I really miss dining at Toyama."}
{"text":"We are hoping to have some authentic Japanese sushi at this highly rated restaurant. I was standing at the door for about 15 minutes before anyone asked me if I was waiting for a table. It took about 20 minutes between the appetizer and the our main dish. The grilled white fish was very salty. The server wasn't very knowledgeable about what's on our Omakase sashimi plate, and she wasn't interested in finding out for us either. The Omakase plate was expensive ($86) but very tiny and not outstanding. Uni nigiri was $12 for two pieces and they were not fresh. Our server did not refill our water even thou our glasses were empty."}
{"text":"If you want real sushi and a wide selection and want it fresh then this is your best bet.  This small sushi restaurant focuses on extremely fresh sushi and sahimi and less so on those fancy cooked rolls that you find in some of the other popular spots.  Sit at the Sushi bar and engage Mo the owner/operator Sushi chef extraordinaire.  I know you will find him charming, knowledgeable and fun to talk to.  Ask about the specials and his recommendations and be bold, try something new and different."}
{"text":"Wow, the food was good but I wouldn't say great.  But, the thing that ruined it for us was the dull server....  We are new to the area and needed a Sushi Fix and saw that this place had a lot of \"5 Star\" reviews.  We were greeted and seated quickly, the place is clean and was not yet crowded, so we told our server we had never been there before, \"What do you recommend and what is good\"?  He was clueless, didn't try to steer us in any direction, didn't make suggestions, just said \"well, whatever you like, most locals just order sashimi\".  He didn't seem to know the menu at all.  We ordered a few things, they were good, but we had to pretty much beg for more Sake, more Tea, Water.... Then they started to get busy and that was the end of his attention to us.  Probably one of the worst service experiences we've had in a LONG time! It sounds like we should have sat at the Sushi Bar and met Mo... I so wish this would have been a better experience!"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise!  I am really satisfied with the entire experience from walking in to the speed and quality of the food.  I got the sushi dinner combo.  The sushi tasted fresh and there was a ton of detail in the flavor.  The rice was sticky and warm, perfect.  The fish was nicely sliced and tasty.  Overall, I loved that I found this place.  I'll be back for more great sushi!"}
{"text":"Ate here several times...as its a small place the owners seemed genuine and friendly however Mo served us old Toro which should have been thrown away. Immediately after serving they crossed it off the specials board.  Smelled and tasted terrible. Had to be from a while back. So disappointed. Was hoping to have a local sushi place I could count on. Never went back."}
{"text":"I went to Toyama with a few friends on Saturday night and had a great experience. The owner and his wife were very nice and she greeted us when we arrived at Toyama.   The sushi was great, very fresh and plenty of different choices to choose from. We were all very happy with our food and service.   They also had Toro available ... which has been hard to find.  My fiance is always asking for it when we go to sushi places and it's been rare that anyone has had it.   Toyama is great  for a smaller place to have dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was amazing as was the service.  Definitely try this place.  More traditional Japanese food - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We found the sushi to be good here. We could not go more than three stars because their prices are a bit high for the atmosphere and portions. We will likely try it again after we try some of the other sushi places around."}
{"text":"I was starting to feel like I'll never find exceptional sushi in Scottsdale, especially close-by in North Scottsdale. I have been driving by Toyama almost every day for almost two years, never thinking it was a restaurant . . . then one day, I stumbled upon a Yelp review while looking for something completely unrelated. I am elated!  Toyama is totally unassuming and unpretentious. We were greeted warmly as soon as we walked in the door by Mo, the owner, who creates the delicious fare. He really must love what he does as he wore a smile on his face the entire time we were there. Next time, we will sit at the sushi bar so that we can get to know him as we will surely be back again and again.   Everything we ate was top-notch, fresh, flavorful. We ordered the Sushi B dinner which came with California Roll (which for a small add on we upgraded to spicy tuna) and six pieces of sushi. Oh, and we got the \"real\" wasabi -- so different from the powdery stuff you normally get -- a nice bite with a sweet finish. That alone is reason to go back. My husband had the miso soup and a salad came with our Sushi B. Loved the dressing on the salad. The real kicker was the Orange Cup Tuna - chunky pieces of tuna, dressed with a citrus sesame sauce presented in a cut out orange rind. Simply magnificent. The Volcano Roll was delicious as well, although I prefer the raw vs. cooked fish.  We contemplated going back the next night, but as hungry as we were, we knew on a Friday night we'd have a long wait. We will definitely be back mid-week so that we can nab a spot at the sushi bar to savor the divine sushi."}
{"text":"Love Mo and the team, sat at the bar last Wednesday. Didn't order just let them make us sashimi and sushi, fish is incredible, rolls very creative, beer cold, saki warm  Not too pricey but well worth for the quality Sometimes I wish they were always packed but then  I wouldn't get a seat at the bar  Go and support, best sushi in AZ"}
{"text":"Was excited to see several decent reviews for a sushi place fairly close to our home.  Well...not that great.  The spicy tuna roll was smaller in diameter than my thumb.  Not much flavor in anything else.  Request was made to sub salmon for yellowtail on a rainbow roll, but they didn't do that either.  Have been trying to find a decent sushi place since moving to Cave Creek, but find ourselves driving back down to Sakana in Scottsdale as we have yet to find anything better."}
{"text":"The best sushi and service.   Tucked away in a strip mall and inconspicuous but really authentic!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST sushi in Phoenix/Scottsdale! There really is an art to slicing sashimi and making sushi rice. I have lived in Japan and this sushi is like eating sushi in Japan."}
{"text":"It's a really great, simple place. Usually if I go to a Japanese restaurant I order sushimi, rolls, appetizers etc but skip the sushi, but if I want some simple great sushi this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Sushi in Scottsdale!!! I've been to several, and though some other places may have great lunch and happy hour prices....they don't come anywhere close to Mo's place!  The fish is so fresh and Mo is awesome, meticulous, and fun!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand how anyone can give this place any stars.  I only gave one star because I couldn't give zero.  This was the worst presentation and the driest fish I have ever seen in a Japanese restaurant. They should be ashamed of what they served and what they charged for it.  Maybe they figure most people in AZ don't know good sashimi?  Think again!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place ever! This is a super great privately owned restaurant that the owners/chefs take great pride in. One of the owners, Moe, is incredible. I love sitting at the bar and chatting with them while they make the dishes. I love asking Moe for some of his recommendations and to to surprised me because there always the most unique rolls I've had. Definitely ask for the hand roll!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhh, a traditional sushi bar! My wife and I were in town for the weekend and had already splurged (big time) on Roka Akor the night before, but were still hankering for a more traditional sushi experience. Since we were way up north, Toyama was a great local choice. I am so glad we ate there!  SERVICE: The service from both the sushi chef/owner (Mo) and the wait staff was excellent. I was a little disappointed they didn't have any raspberry liqueur to satisfy my down-market penchant for \"purple haze\" style hot sake, but I don't hold it against them.  FOOD: As usual I can't recall everything we ate, but it was all very fresh and delicious, meticulously and attractively presented. I give high marks to any sushi chef who serves fresh wasabi instead of the reconstituted powder stuff, and Mo served up some kind of fresh wasabi with diced jalapenos or other chilis in it (I think he called it wasabi pico?).    All in all we were very very happy with this dining experience. Toyama has found a new out-of-state fan in us!"}
{"text":"Everything we had here -- and we ate a ton -- was fantastic. All the sushi was great, but I wish we ordered more smoked salmon. No reason really to splurge on the Toro because the yellowtail, albacore, salmon and all their rolls are phenomenal. Get the octopus cucumber salad to start, too. My only suggestion would be to those of you who like things a bit more spicy, you should do your best to insist on an increased kick with the spicy tuna roll and anything else they say is \"spicy.\" Great place -- we will be there often."}
{"text":"I have eaten sushi most of my life and have been to the best of the best within many of the major US cities including NYC, SanFran, and LA.  Without exception Toyama has the best quality fish I have ever encountered which is quite strange considering it is right in the middle of the desert.  Chef/Owner Mo Kugaguchi takes pride in his quality and does things most other sushi restaurants never take the time or care to do.  I have eaten there countless times and have yet to experience anything questionable or of sub-par quality ever.   If it is not good and fresh, it will not be served.  If any of the reviews indicate bad fish (or chewy salmon as one person states) they simply do not know what good fish is.  Toyama is about the only place in the valley that uses FRESH WHOLE Hamachi which is usually found being broken down right there in front of you.  Just about every other place purchases the IQF loins shipped from Japan which can be OK but will never stand up to fresh.  It is simply the best you can find.   If you are new to sushi or find your favorites in California and spicy tuna rolls, you may not realize the benefit of this place.    If you like Bluefin, toro, FRESH Hamachi, Uni, Saba, Halibut, and other more 'interesting' sushi items, THIS IS YOUR PLACE!   Lastly, this is a place for a foodie, not someone looking for a cool Scottsdale scene or entertainment.  It is a bit on the pricy side but the fish itself is very expensive to buy so it is more of a market thing than directly with Toyama.  Good fresh fish is expensive."}
{"text":"Had no idea this was here and I have been coming to this Safeway plaza for 10 years. I now love this place. Fresh sushi, tasty non-sushi dishes, real Japanese chef and an elegant environment with great music. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Fact. This is the best sushi in Arizona.   Ok, I can't back that up because I haven't been to every Sushi restaurant, but I have had the pleasure of dining at fantastic spots around the country (coastal cities) and this one is solid stuff!   I never really understood why Sushi restaurants existed in places like Arizona, Utah, or any other state that is not California or New York.   Here is why Toyoma rocks my socks:  --FRESH fish. --Chef/Owner handles your stuff. --Crazy Unagi Roll--The Unagi was absolutely divine! --Sashimi Platter--Holy balls. The fish was not warm, and the fragrance reminded me of my favorite sushi joint in LA Katsu-Ya (the original location in Studio City). --Mo and Giro are super sweet and know how to treat their guests --The pièce de résistance? Random selections provided by the chef. I had this Hamachi sashimi which seemed nothing less of a religious experience. So smooth, and like butter. My God.  I am definitely coming back here. This is the perfect restaurant if you love Sushi.  A little on the pricy side, but who cares? It's worth it."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh and original dishes. Every bite is an adventure! Great host and service. The best sushi and shshimi I ever had in Arizona!"}
{"text":"If you're a sushi purist, this place is going to be your home-away-from-home. Sit at the bar, if there's space, because Mo is a delight (and hilarious!), but it's not required to get the best fish. Reminds me of the great neighborhood sushi bars we loved in LA...and that's a HUGE compliment to Toyama."}
{"text":"Been going to Toyama's for over 5 years now and definitely my favorite sushi restaurant in Arizona.  If you are on a date night without the kids definitely sit at the bar by Mo (owner).  We have gotton to know Mo well and love walking in and he remembers our name and always says hello.  Japanese version of Cheers Bar.  We usually just ask him to surprise us with what he recommends and have not yet been disappointed.  Not only does the sushi presentation always look amazing the flavor and quality is top notch.  The whitefish carpaccio is amazing and so is the seabass and halibut sashimi."}
{"text":"I'm not a frequent sushi eater but I do enjoy it from time to time. Toyama is in the same center as the grocery store I shop at so I have known they where there but this was my first time trying them.  My first impression was that this a laid back, non-trendy, neighborhood place.  It was refreshing not to have a young 20 something, \"made up\" hostess with plunging neck line great me and no \"club\" type music blaring - both typical of most of the sushi restaurants in Scottsdale.  The bar was full so I had a small table on what was once a patio that is now closed in.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  The menu consisted of typical sushi offerings with typical sushi pricing.  Now I am not that adventurous so I usually stick to the rolls and I ordered a Philly and Spicy Tuna (my usual's).  While I waited I did notice a significant amount of pick up orders going out so I felt comfortable that the quality must be good if the neighborhood is supporting them.  My rolls arrived and I must say I experienced my first disappointment - they where VERY small and this is my only reason for not giving a 5 star rating.  They where fresh and good but I ended up having to order another roll, the Spicy Salmon, which was equally good.  Because of needing to order extra to \"fill up\" the total price edged up to the higher range of what you can get elsewhere.  That said It wouldn't keep me from coming back - although I would probably prefer to sit at the bar, have a beer, watch a game on the TV, and eat a roll or two when not necessarily needing a full meal....."}
{"text":"I admit it, we came here just because of the reviews. It was some what hidden in the shopping center, but found it...  Small place, but had a large sushi bar up at the front. A lot of decked out Japanese decor and Japanese chefs (whoo hooo!). I had the chicken teriyaki and Kris had the salmon teriyaki... we split a set of california and cucumber rolls. Quality is good, but quantity (particularly in the roll portion was slightly lagging). Waiter was friendly but reserved. Ended up paying a little over $50, which is a bit higher than what we're used to a our fav sushi place in Chandler (Hon Machi), but it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I lived in Tokyo for 5 years. This is real Japanese food and it has the felt of Japan as well. Its a 10.  Best in AZ period if I close my eyes I could easily be back in Tokyo."}
{"text":"Toyama is a fine Sushi restaurant that has been consistently excellent since it opened several years ago. This is the real deal, fresh, quality Japanese food made properly. Sushi is fresh and delicately cut and prepared unlike so many other restaurants which completely miss the importance of proper prep and proportion. This is REAL, QUALITY Japanese food and highlynrecommended"}
{"text":"Tried Toyama for the first time this weekend.  After hearing many good things about it, decided it was finally time to try it.  Sat at the sushi bar with Giro...who was awesome, friendly, and always willing to offer his suggestions on what was best that night.  I'm such a snob when it comes to sushi, if its not the freshest fish possible, I don't like it.  Toyama by far has some of the freshest and highest quality fish I've had in AZ.  I used to live in LA and got spoiled by the surplus of fresh fish.....Toyama reminded me of the fish I could only get in CA.  We had: -Sake (Salmon nigiri) -Tai (Red Snapper nigiri) -Albacore nigiri -Tobiko nigiri w/ Quail Egg -White Fish Carpaccio -Scallops Dynamite -Negihama Roll (Yellowtail w/ Scallions) -Crazy Unagi Roll  Without getting too detailed, I can just safely say every item we had was outstanding.  The nigiri melted in your mouth...the Tai was easily the best I've ever tasted, along with the Salmon.  Something as common as salmon, you would think ok...big deal, but no....it was amazing here.  Another semi-common dish, the Scallops Dynamite, was so incredible we ordered a second round after eating the first.  Huge chunks of fresh scallops, mixed in with mushrooms, baked in a Japanese mayo sauce (which they make in house).  The sauce that results after baking is so good I could drink it through a straw!  Another recommendation....get some chopped wasabi along with your sushi....its delicious bits of real Japanese wasabi that have been pickled.  So good I end up eating all of it by itself.  As far as pricing...in my opinion Toyama is a steal.  I've had more expensive meals at places like Sushi Brokers, with crappy fish to boot.  For the quality of fish and care taken in preparation...Toyama's prices really are reasonable and worth every penny.  Lucky for me I live right down the road from it.....looks like I found my new neighborhood sushi joint :)."}
{"text":"Dropped in to Mo's last night with hubby and kiddo for dinner and it was fabulous, as always!  We didn't sit at the sushi bar this time (not kiddo friendly--he's still wee for the sushi bar.  but soon!).  We waited a bit for a table but enjoyed an Ichiban with hubby while waiting.  Dining room service was fine--our service was relatively attentive, if not a bit on the serious side.    The food was FANTASTIC, as always.  We had: edamame, half seaweed/half squid salad (very small portion on this one), mussels dynamite (yum!), gyoza (yum!), for nigiri we had tuna, salmon, yellowtail, aji (YUM!), salmon roe, and octopus (all fresh and tasty), for specials we had the tuna cup (large chunks of ahi and asparagus in an orange rind 'cup' with a sesame orange YUMMY sauce, and a cucumber roll (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, avocado, wrapped in cucumber with drizzle of ponzu (light and summery).  Kiddo mostly shared our food and also had a side of rice.  He finished with strawberry mochi.  Hubby had another Ichiban and glass (8 oz portion-ish) of cold sake (Kurosawa).  I had green tea.  Total bill was $120-ish, so $150 with tip.  Pretty standard for the quality of food that we got.  No complaints there.  I much prefer the sushi bar experience and personal interaction with Mo, but Toyama gets 5 stars nonetheless.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"When I go to Phoenix for work, this is my go to sushi place. I LOVE this place. The fish is so fresh, and selection is amazing. This is a real Japanese sushi restaurant. Owned and run by Japanese people. It is so comforting to walk into a sushi restaurant to see Japanese sushi chefs at the counter. It is LEGIT.   When you order amaebi (sweet shrimp) they fry the head and give it to you. My favorite is the aji (spanish mackerel). When you order aji, they always give us the fried bones. It is super delicious!   I also love it how every time I go there, they give us something new to try. One time the sushi chef let us try some hamachi belly sashimi. I don't really like hamachi, but this tasted like toro and was super delicious. Last time I went there they gave us some chopped wasabi. I think it was semi pickled since it was salty, but that was really good too!  I am never disappointed when I come here. Please, try it out!"}
{"text":"The best. No trendy bar scene here. Just awesome sushi and service. Its not by accident the guy next to me at the bar was from Japan! Hands down my favorite local Sushi!"}
{"text":"When I was a naïve young man I used to go out and party on weekends. It was as if every Friday was the beginning of a national holiday requiring two days of intoxicated celebration. On any given night I would drop $10 to $30 on cover charges, $50 to $75 on drinks, $10 to $20 for the 2:00AM munchies and another $20 -$30 on a cab ride home. And what was I left with? A headache, some fuzzy memories and taking inventory of decisions made the night before.     Fortunately, with age comes wisdom. I have learned that a better way to celebrate life is to embrace unique opportunities and experiences.  If I am going to spend $100 tonight I am going to spend it wisely.  Eating at Toyama is a \"value added\" decision in my opinion.  I have gone twice now in as many weeks and both meals were fantastic.  My sister and brother-in-law joined me last Friday.  They were here visiting from California. We decided to go for broke and order the \"Omakase\" - chef's choice.  When it was all said and done they both agreed that a meal like this would have cost twice as much in LA.  While I can't remember every detail, some of the highlights were as follows...  -        An amazing sashimi platter, with fresh tuna, yellowtail and uni.   -        Two different toro dishes. One Nigiri and one toro tartare dish. -        This incredible Spanish mackerel  sushi topped with a thin strip of sweet kelp. -        A custom roll with Thai hot sauce, tuna and avocado. Amazing. -        Salmon roe sushi soaked and rinsed the proper  way.  It went on and on. Each new dish was a new indescribable flavor experience. One dish had this Japanese shisho leaf on it. We were all at the table trying to come up with a comparable flavor to describe it....\"It tastes like a licorice-earthy-minty-nutmegy-etc...\"...sounding like wine snobs trying to come up with just the right description, only this was food.  Really good food.   We got there early and were the only patrons for awhile so part of the amazing experience was the great conversation with our chef. We talked about golf, football, chef's knives, Santa Barbara, Japanese whisky, our favorite restaurants, etc... It was so interactive.  A great meal, a great evening... a great memory. Well worth the money."}
{"text":"This place makes excellent food and the service is superb,  The eel roll was excellent as well as the other rolls we had.  Their house salad was my favorite as they serve those healthy looking greens and not iceberg which I don't care for.  I would give it 5 stars except it lacks variety.  But what they do make is very good and they have all the basics.  Nice place in a nice area."}
{"text":"I went here based on yelp reviews...are you serious?  This was the worst sushi place I have been to. We ordered Salmon nigiri...looks like they used a serrated knife to cut the salmon...it was  unpleasant to the eye, however tasted great. We then ordered the Volcano roll...absolutely horrible. Very fishy tasting...it was a cooked roll, which did not say that in the description, and the pieces were cut about 1/4 inch thick...fell apart as soon as you picked it up.   Skip this place."}
{"text":"I was looking for a restaurant in the area of Desert Ridge Marketplace for a nice date night while my children were at The Play Factory.  I picked this place based on the great Yelp reviews.  I was really disappointed!  They seated us in a thickly curtained in outdoor dining area with fans and air conditioning.  Even though it was 100* outside it was FREEZING in this dining area.  Another customer refused to be seated in there while we were having dinner.  I had goose bumps and asked twice to have the temp brought up a few degrees.  We ordered hot sake.. for two reasons... we like hot sake and to warm up a bit.  It tasted TERRIBLE.  I have never had a sake I didn't like.  It tasted watered down (almost 50/50) and overly fermented (rotten/moldy).  I informed the waiter and asked for a different cold sake.  He was very indifferent and kept saying no one else had complained about it.  (I didn't even see a single other table with a sake pitcher on their table.  For an appetizer I got the sauteed asparagus.  The asparagus was fresh but the flavor of the sauce (mostly soy sauce with what tasted like sesame oil and sesame seeds) was to strong and not that good.  Also they were unable to make it gluten free for my husband even though they had wheat free tamari.  (The wheat free tamari is one of the two reasons I am giving the restaurant 2 stars instead of 1).  I am a vegetarian and ordered the vegetable tempura roll, the cucumber roll and the veggie roll.  The cucumber roll was boring.  The veggie roll didn't taste fresh.  Even the chunks of avocado had brown spots on them.  The vegetable tempura roll was my favorite thing about the whole restaurant.  It was DELICIOUS.  With yam, onion and asparagus battered and placed in the middle of the rice and sea weed it was my favorite vegetarian sushi roll I think I have ever had.  My husband ordered yellowtail, salmon and spicy yellowtail roll.  He thought the fish quality was mediocre and that the slices were very thin compared to other valley restaurants.  We will not go back.  $51 bill and I was not satisfied at all.  In fact I felt a bit nauseous after leaving."}
{"text":"As soon as I saw Blake B's review, I knew I had to visit Toyama!  I, too, have been a Sushi Brokers regular for about 10 years. During that time, the service has been very hit-or-miss... so I thought it was time to try something new.  Being nervous about trying new sushi places, I thought I would start by looking at reviews before taking a chance.  I'm so glad that we did!  We had a number of different rolls, sushi, and sashimi.  All were super delish and very, very fresh and high quality.  Got heaps and \"refills\" of fresh ginger, as we seem to consume that as much as the fish!  The Unagi roll (eel) was SOOOO good, as was the Cucumber tuna (not the official name) roll.  But everything we had was fantastic.  Small place, and we sat at the sushi bar and was able to chat and ask questions about what to get. Great service and we'll definitely be returning regularly!"}
{"text":"The service is incredible! The food is amazing! We had Dynamite Scallops, Veggie Sushi, Cod, Spicey Tuna Rolls, and Shrimp Tempura Rolls. Everything was so delicious and so fresh! They hand pick everything that comes through the door and only use the best ingredients. I would definitely recommend this place for any Sushi lover!"}
{"text":"It's easy to forget that there may be decent places to eat up in N. Scottsdale.  Heading back into town from Carefree we decided to get dinner on the way and saw the sign in the strip mall.  I told my friend to just drop me off  to check out the place before she parked.  Not looking like a Pure or ultra trendy/gimmicky Japanese restaurant it caught my interest.  As I looked thru the window I saw an actual Japanese (not Korean - asians can tell the difference)  chef behind the bar.  Not really expecting much I suggested we give it a shot.  We sat at the bar and a friendly Japanese woman (later learn that she is the owner/chef's wife) greeted us with menus and pointed to the specials board.  While the fish on display seemed limited it didn't' look daunting.  We ordered some sashimi, a few specials, and 2 rolls.  The quality and freshness was surprisingly very good; pieces were cut with precision and the rice was just right.  Prices were a little high but i guess justifiable considering the rent and other operating costs to this small establishment.  It's too bad this place is kind of out of the way and currently only has dinner service.  But If you're into a more traditional style sushi experience with a simple approach you may want to check Toyama out."}
{"text":"Great sushi experience here!  The wait staff was very attentive, and the freshness of product was top notch.  I think it's funny that it's taken me 5 years of being in the valley to finally eat here but I'm so glad I did.  Some of the stand outs were the fried baby octopus, uni, toro, and the striped amber jack nigiri.  Judging from what I saw last night Toyama will definitely be my new go to spot when I have that sushi craving I can't shake."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. My wife and I had a wonderful dinner here a few days ago. We live close but didn't realize the the restaurant was nearby. The sushi was wonderful: Fresh and very clean. We sat at the bar and the place was very busy. The sushi came a bit slow but the place was packed. The appetizers came first and were good except the tempura veggies which were not good: the coating was not crispy. The sautéed mushrooms were very good. Our favorite roll was the toyama roll that had scallops on top.  The service was very gid and once the place cleared out a bit the sushi came very quickly. Value is good for the quality. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"The best in Phoenix.  And trust me, we have searched. My husband and I enjoy traditional sushi over trendy sushi. And Mo takes his restaurant seriously with a friendly smile. It is always consistant and fresh, and served as edible art. Yes, it's fairly expensive compared to the others in Phoenix. But it's worth every penny. They even have a few tables where you can enjoy a family dinner."}
{"text":"Some people need to have the 'freshest fish possible' in order to give a sushi joint a high rating.  Others need ambiance, an overly animated sushi chef, or great service. I need none of those at a sushi restaurant.  i need a generous supply of booze on the cheap so I'm able to wash down this gelatinous shit while attempting a faux smile, indicating to my date who suggested we go here in the first place, how I'm thoroughly enjoying the experience.  I'm not. But she'll never know that.  What I am enjoying however is the Japanese beer served in two-liter bottles.  The sake, which I occasionally bomb my brew with. And the waitress, who reminds me of one of those giggling little dolts featured on Iron Chef.  Try this. Inquire about anything on the menu, purposely mispronouncing it, or at the very least, using the inflection of a redneck.  Then sit back and watch her giggle, like one of those cutesy asian judges who'd just tried one of Bobby Flay's odder-than-owl-shit creations.  Its adorable.  Only because this is Yelp will I suggest a dish. The tuna tempura roll.  Again, not because I like raw fish, but rather how it's served with hot sauce which when combined with their freshly ground wasabi, some ginger, soy sauce and a gulp of beer, will actually produce a nice little taste-bud orgasm."}
{"text":"WE were taken there by a friend who raved about the place since he lived in japan for 18 years said it was best place in town. we used to always go to pure but have since switched here.  We love the CHEF hes amazing and we always go in and just tell him to surprise us! Its the Best!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in Arizona. I think I would eat here everyday if I could. Mo takes such pride in having the freshest fish around. I'm not into the  places that are all about \"seeing and being seen\" and not so into all the fancy rolls that mask the flavors of the fish, either. If you want phenomenal sushi, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"3 cockroaches during dinner...  The sushi was decent but for $30 a person to deal with absentee waitstaff (although apologetic), so-so decorating, 50's music and 3 cockroach sightings... definitely a place to avoid."}
{"text":"Better quality sushi than the franchised sushi bars. Toyama is owned an operated by a very nice man from Japan that looks like he is 19 but he older and educated in the sushi business. It was more expensive than I prefer, but it is located in North Scottsdale were things cost more."}
{"text":"Love this place- food is fresh and tasty, exactly what sushi should be. Sushi chefs also very friendly.  My favorite dish is a tuna tartar dish which is a daily special, although it's been on the menu every day I've been there over the last 6 months or so.  It's fresh tuna with soy sauce, avocado, pine nuts, scallions, sesame oil, garlic sauce, and egg roe.  It is ridiculously good!"}
{"text":"Tried this place based on some recommendations and positive Yelp reviews. We got there around 6 PM and most of the tables and bar stools were taken. The main room reminds me of sushi places in LA. The other room is an enclosed patio that almost seems like an after thought. The fish is fresh and I stayed with the sushi options and also went with a few tempura options."}
{"text":"Best sushi we have ever had.  Monk fish pate beyond words.  Love sitting at the sushi bar.  Chefs are fun to talk with.  Wait staff attentive."}
{"text":"Hands down, best sushi in Phoenix. A gem in the middle of north Phoenix. I'm not sure how I didn't know this place was here. We sat by the sushi bar and let the co-owner surprise us with different sushi dishes to sample...and we were pleasantly surprised. I love sushi, and I think I'm spoiled from going anywhere else forever.....it's a new favorite!"}
{"text":"Business needs to update its hours of operation.  Came here on a Sunday at 6 pm and it's closed?  A little frustrating..."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Martika - Toy Soldiers)  Bite by bite Yelp to Yelp Left, write, left With all Five Stars  At Toyama  It wasn't my intention to ignore you It never should have been this way, What can I write? It's true I was extended an invitation (Thanks Roxy H.) I never knew how long you'd stay, When you grill Hamachi jaws It's my heart it takes Takes my heart    Am I Japanese...no but I can pass as one!  Chef Mo questioned as I sat next to my partner at the sushi bar.  He was energetic and entertaining at the same time reminding me of most of the chefs I met in Japan.    We started off with a bottle of Sake and with a toast our night started!  Chef Mo said the Yellowtail was the way to go that night so we shot for it; Yellowtail Sashimi & Hamachi Kama (Yellowtail Fish Jaw).  Boy was he right the sashimi was like butter and freshly cut while the Hamachi was grilled to perfection with some char still lingering providing a smoky burnt scent; tender and flaky was in each bite.  We continue to wet our palates with an Uni Shooter, sweet to the taste and gelatinous from the quail egg while the Uni provided a burst of the ocean in our mouths!  As we continued to order the Amaebi (Sweet Shrimp served Nigiri style while it's head deep fried), Chef Mo surprised us with some fried baby octopus.  Similar texture to calamari, but sweeter and more girth for sure; great with beer in my mind!  As for the Amaebi, its always a little weird to eat somethings head, but I'll get this any day and any time!  The shrimp was indeed sweet while the tempura heads were crispy, crunchy, and flaky.  We ended with some Salmon Roe, which to my surprise my partner never had!?  Punch to the throat!  However, watching her stuff her first bite of it was both pleasurable and comical -- wink!  If I could only post the expression of her face as the salty sea bite overwhelmed her palates!   In the end, Toyama is definitely a sweet spot for sushi and fun in my books!  The place is quaint and perfect to have an intimate dinner, but entertaining; as Chef Mo's aura brings out the warmth and welcoming cheer any quest would appreciate! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What else can I say that hasn't already been said by you other crazy Yelpers? This place is a hidden gem! I talked with Mo for a while about how they don't advertise very much because they get so many customers word-of-mouth and I can definitely see why! This place is stellar everything about it, the fish is so fresh definitely one of my top spots now! I traveled all the way from the west side to try it and I'm so glad I did. I had two quail egg shooters which were so tasty and just the right amount of ponzu and roe. Next I had the tako sashimi- it was cut perfectly and there was not a piece that was too chewy! I also got the monkfish liver pate and I think I need about 5 more orders STAT! Next up was the deliciously fatty toro hand roll. The rice in this was perfect and really accentuated the great taste of the fish. And last but not least, I had Mo make me a surprise! He gave me a salmon skin roll with salmon roe on top. It was soooooo good! The dry, chewiness of the skin paired perfectly with the popped salmon roe. Cannot wait to come back with a friend for some Omakase dishes!    Domo arigato!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret - yet not! I have  been a Toyama customer for years and I want to share that this hidden gem (you likely drive by it regularly) is one of my favorite \"go to\" spots when craving sushi.  Fresh and creative with  service that  is spot on. I have never left disappointed and is worth a visit."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with most of the other reviews. I am originally from AZ, so I think I was a little naive as to what sushi/sashimi was really meant to taste like, that is until I moved to the coast of New England. It seems no matter where I look, what I try, NOTHING comes remotely close to the FRESH, quality fish I've grown accustomed to. I understand that we're a little landlocked in AZ, but if the Northeast can get fresh fish from Hawaii, then I think we should be able to get something decent at least from CA or the Pacific NW.   But, I digress - I really think the nigiri at Toyama was overpriced and overrated. The sake selection limited and a bit pricey. Our waiter was not very attentive or helpful. On the other hand, their fish selection was much more extensive than other restaurants and the house salad with ginger dressing was tasty.  I was really hoping to like this place more, but my hunt for quality sushi will have to continue on..."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm just now writing my review on Yelp for my favorite sushi joint in town!    My husband has known Mo since way back in the day when Mo was working his magic at Sushi Ko.   We've been going to see Mo at Toyama for about 8 yrs now and we both agree that Mo delivers the freshest sushi in town. Hands down, this is the place to go if you are only about the fish.  It might not be the hip place to go to if you are all dolled up and looking for a scene.  But if you are a serious sushi fan, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"If you like authentic sushi- and by that I mean not loaded with sauces and crazy mayo mixtures. AND prepared by people actually from Japan - then you have found the spot Everything is fresh and delicious.  And Mo and Jiro are wonderful! Specials daily... I can't say enough good things about the food and service!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!   There's no fire or gigantic koi ponds to captivate your senses but if you're looking for fresh fish and food that will knock your socks off...  this is the best sushi.  Toyama's a quint sushi bar with an extremely cool owner/sushi chef named Mo, who aims to please!   Mo is from Japan and as authentic as the food, plus a funny guy to talk with.  It's really cool to see an owner take such pleasure and pride in his craft.  The food is awesome and shows Mo's passion for delighting his clientele.  I highly suggest not looking at the menu or the specials and ask Mo to \"hook you up\".  I don't think I've had the same thing twice.  I'm a new \"regular\" and I like it!"}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI IN THE WHOLE VALLEY!  The owner mo has 25+ years of sushi making experience and is from Toyama Japan. They carry a lot of fish you won't find anywhere else in the valley, like sea bream, striped jack, halibut fin & many more.  Yellowtail taste fresher than any I've had anywhere else. The most authentic sushi I've ever had, and I'm a huge foodie from San Francisco who has eaten at some of the best sushi restaurants on the west coast.   This place caters to the rich and famous, and there is a reason why!  Notable items on the menu include: spicy Toyama roll, crazy unagi roll, tuna tempura roll, volcano roll, the omakase sashimi plate(chefs choice), tuna tartar, white fish carpaccio, orange cup tuna, hamachi kama, red snapper, halibut, sea bream, Spanish mackerel, yellowtail......ya, pretty much everything!  No, they DONT have happy hour. If you want cheap, low quality sushi, go to sushi brokers. You want the highest quality fish in the valley, you come here!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and friendly atmosphere, I would recommend sitting at the sushi bar and talking to the chefs!"}
{"text":"The very best sushi and sushimi I ever had The freshness is very evident The waiter was very knowledgeable and really helped us in choosing our delicious dinner The white fish carpaccio was really Fantastic  Excellent food,very creative menu."}
{"text":"I would have to say that this place is an Arizona 5-star yelp rating.  In NYC, this would be a solid 4.  That out of the way, I've been here 3 times now and can say that the fish has always been very fresh on all three visits.  The sake selection is great.  Our favorite is the one from Toyama, which is the hometown of the owner in Japan.  If you plan to go here frequently, you can buy a large bottle and they will save it for you.  There are two things that make this place much more pleasant to go to than Yasu.  The first is the originality in the menu items.  They have an orange tuna avocado with orange-mizo glaze that I love. Mo also makes a salmon avocado roll with and entire diced soft shell crab on top.  All three times, I have ordered the omakase here.  And all three times, I have had new menu items.  Also, all three times, I have sat at the bar which to me is a must if you are going to get omakase.  The second thing that makes this place officially my favorite sushi spot in AZ is the owner and chef, Mo.  He is really friendly and on our second visit he remembered us.  Because of him, the whole restaurant has a laid-back, friendly appeal unlike places like Roka-Akor and Yasu which have more of an arrogant flair.  This is definitely my favorite sushi joint in the valley.   Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"My favorite place, a bit pricey and smaller portions but quality sushi. Mo is awesome and always has great conversation."}
{"text":"Food was good however, the order it was brought out was odd and we waited a long time for a Sunday night for service brought out one main course, and no one else's. not sure, maybe an off night."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the Phoenix area. The Omakase is best - Mo makes great recommendations and a good variety of sushi. Sit at sushi bar."}
{"text":"Everything here is top quality. I recommend sitting at the sushi bar. I also recommend you order the assorted sashimi platter it's enough for two!  There are fresh daily specials as well as house favorites from the menu.  Japanese whisky TOGOUCHI is our favorite and found here. Such a beautiful smooth ending.  By far the #1 sushi spot in N Scottsdale. We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Located at the corner of pinnacle peak and Scottsdale road , Toyama specializes in authentic Japanese cuisine.  This is a  very small restaurant with only a dozen tables and a sushi bar. The food is very tasty and the sushi very fresh. The service is a little slow though.. We were served one dinner at a time making it a little difficult to eat together."}
{"text":"We had shrimp tempura and the salmon teriyaki.  It wasn't bad, but wasn't great either and worst of all ... way over priced.  We have never been to a Japanese restaurant that didn't give you miso soup when you ordered a dinner entree.  They came with salads, but the dressing wasn't very appealing and the lettuce wasn't as crisp as it should have been.  The small piece of salmon arrived topped with 2 really tiny asparagus spears and a bowl of rice.  The tempura was okay, but the sauce served with it was rather bland.  We just expected more (besides the miso soup)...some maki, more vegetables or pickles..something.  Maybe their sushi is a better value and that's why they're getting 4-5 stars."}
{"text":"Yum, yum and yum!  A neighbor introduced me to this gem and am I certainly appreciative!  This is not a bass-thumping sushi mega-factory, but a small inviting space where the food is the feature attraction.  Everything I tried was fresh and perfectly presented.  Five stars, easy!"}
{"text":"This year the holidays were in Arizona and we were in the mood for sushi. While sceptical of sushi in the desert I was encouraged by the Yelp reviews so had to give Toyama a try.  The out of the way location and strip mall look did not inspire confidence but if you have traveled enough you will have found many gems in similar locations so we pressed on.   It was early and Toyama was just opening - apparently its so busy that this is the optimium time - so we had our choice of seats and in that scenario we always pick the sushi bar. Mo was on hand and didnt disappoint in his role as host as evidenced by other reviews. He was friendly and informative about the fish, where its sourced and what makes great sushi. Everything we tried was fresh, high quality and executed perfectly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Have tried many sushi restaurants since moving here from Chicago with no luck.  Based on the yelp reviews, decided to check it out - not too far from home.  Excellent!  Mo was great and very helpful.  The fish was some of the freshest I have ever had.  Yellowtail melts in your mouth and excellent halibut with ponzu.  Very friendly atmosphere.  This will be hard to top so new go to sushi place.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"What a great find close to home! Grabbed a quick bite with hubby.  Sushi is fresh and service perfect. Highly recommend the Spicy Toyama roll!"}
{"text":"Quality has gone way down and can't recommend this place anymore. Hiro Sushi is my new go-to."}
{"text":"Sorry, but something must have happened to this place since Ellen J. and Monica B. wrote their reviews.  My girlfriend and I went there tonight for our monthly sushi fix and to catch up.  It was nice to have it so quiet - we were the only ones in the restaurant for an hour - but we understand why.  The service was attentive but the food was poor.  The portions are small - you get twice as much at most other places for the same price - the happy hour offered nothing of interest - and they do not have a full bar as is listed - only beer and wine.  Imitation crabmeat?  Sorry - that's just not authentic fare and definitely not serious sushi.   We were very disappointed.  Fortunately the conversation was good!  But we won't be back here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Toyama; we started coming here after Mo opened (We used to visit him at a restaurant where he worked.); this is by far the best sushi bar in the Valley!  Why, might you ask?  Here you go: *  My husband works in procurement for a major hotel company buying fish and beef - he knows fresh fish! *  Did you ever talk to the customers at the sushi bar?  Many are local Valley chefs - chefs only eat where there is good fresh food. *  Friendly Sushi Chefs - The chef/owner is one of the sushi chefs; he will explain fish to you, help you try new things and is pretty creative.  They treat their customers right.  (And so does Mimi, Mo's wife!) *  Service Staff - how many servers greet you by name when you walk in and have your favorite beverage right up for you?  Also, Mo's had very consistent staff over the years; meaning they like working there and get along. *  Tempura - don't laugh - but one of the better tempura batters around - try it!  We have been missing our weekly/bi-weekly sushi fixes lately due to travel, but with the fall back, we will see you at Toyama."}
{"text":"Went here cause i wanted japanese style sushi.   This place converted a patio into a Arizona/sun room and then A/C'd it. Doesn't really match the whole \"japanese\"/sushi feel they had going on inside. Anyways enough about the decor.  I read some reviews, people said it was japanese style sushi. Well it was, but it was knock down great. I love to gauge sushi bars off of their Sashimi. Um... thats where they dropped on their face pretty hard.   I mean this is the livelihood of your restaurant, I was expecting some pretty good sashimi since the price was up on that end. The salmon had that old fish taste and smell, something that didn't really leave you saying i want more. The Tuna, BLECH! it didn't even taste anything recognizable.    We had two rolls, those were alright, but have gotten equally \"alright\" tasting rolls for half the price.  Wont be back. :( sad day"}
{"text":"Toyama is one of my top 3 favorite joints to grab some seriously amazing and fresh sushi! Mo the owner really prides himself on providing some of the freshest fish to his customers. Frankly he hasn't ever steered me wrong!  This isn't the type of place you will want to hit up if your looking for an overly sauced, California roll. Toyama is really for people looking for high quality and authentic sushi. The service is always amazing and Mo always provides a great education about the fish and honestly he is pretty funny to boot!   Place is pricey but like all good things you pay for quality."}
{"text":"Unfortunately it was a while since I ate here but forgot to write this review sooner.  Overall I was pretty pleased with their food here.  Their agedashi tofu was done in a way that was so different from the typical.  The sauce was actually a mushroom broth that was really yummy. The only gripe was that when you asked the waiter what was good - he said everything.  It depends on what you like.  Sheesh - duh!"}
{"text":"I really would rather not leave a review and keep this place a secret because of my own selfishness! Haha!    Sushi is super fresh and beautiful. The portions are appropriate. The soft shell crab tempura is delicate and crisp. If you like wasabi, asked for the \"chopped wasabi!\" It will make your meal an adventure!    We used to be a chain restaurant type of sushi people but we now truly appreciate the small, quaint and unique dining experience!"}
{"text":"Over priced mediocre sushi and poor service make it hard to give this restaurant a good review, but charging a 20 percent tip for a party of five after rude and slow service clinches the one star.  Adding insult tto injury, my waiter had the nerve to tell me that sushi (no frills hotate sashimi in this particular case) takes a long time to prepare - I typically have live scallop prepared in less than half the time.  Needless to say, i wont be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place to meet up w sushi loving friends!  The wagu beef is amazing, the tuna tartare is amazing, the mochi is delish.  I would so come back here"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. Mo the owner is top notch and only brings in the freshest fish and ingredients! Some of these other negative 1 and 2 star reviews are cracking me, up I'm not buying them. Yeah the decor in the sun room patio may not be \"Japanese\" enough for you but the rolls, service and up most the sashimi (how you should really rate a sushi place) is excellent and I would even go as far as the best in the valley. A++ give it a try and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food, but pricey. This should be marked as a $$$ restaurant. Imported Japanese Wagyu was incredible and all fish was super-fresh. If pricing was better, 5-stars!"}
{"text":"Small and more quint than expected, which is a good thing. Service was exceptional. Took a little long for our rolls to be made, but when they arrived, I was very happy."}
{"text":"We are almost afraid to write a review as we  want Toyama to continue to be the hidden gem that it is....Some of the best sushi we have ever had.  Clearly, Mo takes great pride in the quality of his seafood."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 5-6 times since discovering Toyama a couple months ago. It's a tiny place, but very cute. You should sit at the sushi bar so that you get a chance to meet the owner, Mo. He is delightful. We usually get the omakase, and I think has been a great deal for the amount of yummy items. Ask your server or Mo what is fresh, we have never been disappointed. I also recommend the ginban sake! MMMMM! Now I want more sushi!"}
{"text":"Top 3 sushi places in Phoenix. No overly sauced rolls, no great cooked options, mediocre atmosphere. For presentation i would only give it a slightly above par. The owner/sushi chef cares about two things; his customers and his fish. Mo might buy fish from the same company as other sushi bars but his close relationship with them and his willingness to send anything back that isn't up to his standards is evident in the freshness of his fish. Sit at the sushi bar, tell them your preferences, and let them make all the decisions."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY and read the reviews first! I made the mistake of seeing the high star average (probably fake yelp accounts by the owner) and couldn't figure out why until it was too late. It started the moment we ordered edamame and heard the microwave go \"DING\" in the background. Dried up pea pods with flavor like cardboard. Gave it a chance and decided to order the sea scallops and small portion sashimi dinner. Sashimi was old and far from fresh, scallops dish looked like a bowl of water...clearly a frozen dish nuked and ready for profit. This restaurant is not friendly, light bulbs out in several places, dust build up and sticky tables, wait staff hardly around and not interested in smiling or even asking how the food tasted. To add insult to our evening the check came to $89 for 2 people from that tiny order plus 2 beers! Go to Pure, Sushi Brokers or Yume all about 5min south of this dive. Much better quality, service and prices."}
{"text":"They must pay people for these reviews!  The worst sushi, stale, small portions and EXTREMELY poor service!!  Salty cod, leather calamari, and stale salmon!!  Takes forever to be served and then to wait forever for their food!  Save your money on this place!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted and I just can't get enough...just can't get enough!  In the past two months, I've eaten at 7 different sushi restaurants, including two in New York, and Toyama remains a slice above the rest. The intimacy of the atmosphere, the freshness of the fish, and the skill of the Itamae make Toyama an outstanding Arizona gem.   If you enjoy traditional sushi and have yet to visit Toyama, be sure to make the trek to North Scottsdale and you will not be disappointed. Mo and Giro will cater to your tastes and they will create something delightful.  If you go this week, try the red snapper!"}
{"text":"I moved to Scottsdale from the SF Bay Area for work relocation.   I was very worried I would not able to find good sushi; since well... we are in a desert.   I tried several other places in and around Scottsdale area that were the \"hip\" type of sushi places like Sapporo and Sushi Brokers. Yeah they were entertaining, and expensive and not authentic. Yeah they had full bars and very hot looking women and men at those \"fashion-ney\" places. A sushi bar is not for me to sit at a \"bar' and then have a piece of paper stuck in my face and ask me to order by ticking off little square boxes. When I want a drink; I will go to a bar... but when I want sushi... those are places are not the places to goto. If you know what the hell you are eating... steer clear of these fake sushi places... besides you don't want to eat those ridiculous rolls with too much fish and sauce and... my god someone kill me.   But I want an authentic sushi bar... a sushi bar where I can talk to a real Japanese sushi master; where I can say the word \"omakase\" and he will know what to do... where the maguro looks like its fresh and not from the ice box; and when they have aji, and toro, and none of those hyped up rolls with too much crap in them... simple; clean; no gimmick sushi.   Price was really what tipped me over for the final five stars...(give them six if I can) I had ordered the Omakse that night; which is chef special; I end up having... 2 pieces each order.   good maguro (pink ending; close to the toro part)  crisp mirugai  fresh scallops  new Zealand salmon  large sweet ama ebi  Aji with ponzu and ginger/ green onions (the way to really eat it)  Suzuki with ponzu  Kampachi   and a Large Kirin..   my bill come out to be 65 dollars with tax and tip... for a chef menu @ 16 pieces and beer... not to mention a kick ass chef and good conversations; while watching USC raping Wash on TV that night.   People who really know sushi will realize that 65 dollars for this kind of meal is absolute steal. Even from where I am from the best; Sushi Sams @ san mateo... appetizer; 10pc nigiri; small desert comes to 50 dollars a head... no drink. So the price range is right, if not a bit of cost savings.   Finding Toyama has really really saved me from self destruction!   The place is ran and owned by Japanese folks.... they are very nice and very humble... I have to say; the fish was beyond my expectation; and I dare compare this place to many of the BEST SF Bay Area sushi places. Sushi Sam of San Mateo is still the best on my list; but this place takes the cake for PHX area hands down... and is besides from creativity; a relatively close second to Sams.   note... if you love wasabi... as them to bring you the chopped wasabi.. its not paste; and its awesome.   Yelpers... thanks for steering me to this one; my chances of survival in the desert just hit up a couple more notches."}
{"text":"Seriously the best sushi in town. If you have to drive, drive. Jiro is the owner. Trust him. Awesome food, great drinks & great service."}
{"text":"This is a great Japanese restaurant. The appetizers that we had were gyoza, tuna tempura roll, and the calamari. They were all very good and tasted fresh. My wife had the chicken katsu which was well prepared. It was not heavily breaded like many I have tasted before, and the sauce to go with it was good. I had some yellowtail and salmon sashimi. It all tasted very fresh! It all just melted in my mouth. The head sushi chef/owner also had us try some special wasabi that he made. That tasted really well with everything. We also tried the miso soup, which was one of the better ones I have had. I am half Japanese and have had tried many Japanese restaurants and this one is one of the best in the Phoenix area. To top it all off the owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"Great meal at Toyama last night.  Friendly service, the hamachi was incredible, dissolved in our mouths, and we were all stunned by the amazing tuna tartar with avocado and pistachios!!  I haven't seen anything like that at any other sushi restaurant in town and will definitely come back for it again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been searching for a new favorite sushi bar in North Scottsdale...well, we found it. Toyama is superb!  The owner/chef, Mo, is amazing! Very conversational and personable, oh...and he makes some absolutely delicious sushi! He asked us what we liked, and gave some samples of things along the way. We ordered one last roll, and he made one special for us based on what he thought we liked. It was fantastic!!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"By far, the freshest fish to be found anywhere  - Toyama is a gem - and Chef Owner Mo is very accomodating, and has a great sense of humor. His hand rolls and specials are some of the best in town.  For a true live experience, I do recommend sitting at the bar as the sushi chefs are quite talkative and very knowledgeable about their trade.  Recommended specials: Toyama roll, orange cup tuna, seasoned squid salad.  Service: best at the bar - dining room staff is attentie, yet inconsistent and more often than not - just plain aloof! If you want to sit in fron of Mo at the bar, just make sure you arrive there plenty early."}
{"text":"Has to be one of the best kept secrets in town!  As someone who does not eat meat and loves fish but being landlocked .. Fresh fish can be a challenge !!!   I've never had a bad or even mediocre meal in this fantastic find ! A small hidden neighborhood gem is probably my favorite place for sushi! Mo's great smile, talent and fresh fish makes this place excellent ! He makes special requests with a smile on his face and always remembers my unique requests !   I agree with others reviews that maybe out of self serving thoughts not to share .. But u can't be there every day so why not ?!?!   Not particularly a  fan of chain restaurants so this find is a must tell ! Must visit ! You too will be 'hooked' !!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had on the west coast. Having lived in Japan for years I mean that. The staff is Japanese and while it's expensive, it's as good as I've had outside of Japan. I'll go back when my bank account allows.  Plus when I went I met Yutaka Sudo, the old coach(?) of the Yomiuri Giants, which is a huge deal in Japan. They're the most famous baseball team in the country. There he was just sitting there, having sushi in some brown adobe complex halfway into the desert."}
{"text":"At the conference I attended in Phoenix we had a craving for sushi.  I was a bit hesitant of what the choices would be given that we were in the desert.  However, a quick search of top rated places on Yelp found Toyama.  The reviews focused on the food, especially the quality of the fish that was served.  We rounded up the gang and headed off to Toyama after a quick review of their website.  I found Toyama to be refreshing.  Away from trendy places with standard americanized rolls and odd ingredients to make a fancy menu.  Toyama had a nice mix of various dishes that were mouthwatering and delicious.  Appetizers with 2 types of ika, a standard type of calamari and a dish with the calamari legs deep fried in a kaarage style.  I particularly enjoyed the legs with the light crisp batter and tender ika.  Also partook of the misoyaki butterfish with shiro miso in a Toyama style was great.  The miso was creamy and tangy with a crisp salt taste.  The fish was tender and moist with a grilled crust to the skin that intensified the miso flavor, great as an appetizer and would be wonderful as a main dish.  The sushi was excellent.  There was a few rolls that ended up on our table but I focused on the nigiri as that is my taste preference.  The ikura were salty and plump, there were no mushy eggs present.  Ikura was crisp with a clear taste, clearly from quality stock and preparation.    Many times saba can be overly vinegary or mealy if not of good stock.  The saba at Toyama was firm and fresh tasting.  There was the mild tang of vinegar but without overpowering the fish itself.  This is why I usually order ikura and saba to feel out a new sushi place, and I was very pleased with Toyama.  We also had suzuki, scallop, and tako, all of which were well prepared and fresh.  The sushi-su was clear and had a bright mildly sweet taste to it.  The rice was well cooked with tender grains, no overcooked mushy sections or undercooked hard areas.  The nigiri were well formed and consistent in shape.  Over all  I was extremely pleased with the sushi from Toyama and would be happy to eat here again."}
{"text":"SLOOOOW. Waited about 20 minutes for 1 sushi roll and another 15+ for the rest. The place was fairly empty... puzzling. Sushi was good but I'd choose to go somewhere quicker in the future, particularly since Toyama isn't the cheapest in town. Also, the edamame didn't taste very fresh.   2.5 stars"}
{"text":"We just moved to Scottsdale, AZ from California and had not yet found a good sushi place.  I am so happy to have found a great sushi place at Toyama.  It is a local little restaurant here in town and it is wonderful to have such a delicious place to have my favorites.  We met Mo and he is great, we really enjoyed chatting with him.  I loved the Nigiri portions... Big on fish and light on the rice.  Just perfect.  I had the salmon, yellow tail, clam, and eel nigiri.  So so so good.  My husband had Katsu and Gyoza and loved it.  If you are looking for authentic Japanese this is the place to go.  We will be returning again and again and again.  When we were ready to leave another couple came in and Mo told us they had been coming into Toyama's for sushi for 10 years.  I love places like this... They have roots in the community and it is clear they take great pride in their food and service."}
{"text":"I came to Toyama with a couple friends who had heard good things about their food from a friend who had recently been to Japan. It was a bit out of the way, but we were excited to try it. The restaurant is small but cute. We were seated in their enclosed patio (arizona room?), which had the nice feeling of being outside without actually being outside. We tried many menu items- agadashi tofu, asparagus, veggie tempura roll, tuna roll, gyoza, and the beef over rice appetizer. I'm sorry to say, nothing was that delicious or memorable. Most of the food was very plain and nothing special, especially for the price. The asparagus was served plain with a little sesame seed on top. The rolls were fine, but not amazing. One of the people in our party had a roll he said was tasty, but I didn't try that one. The beef over rice was one of the biggest disappointments. The beef was this thin fatty mangled beef web... Like a thin slice gone terribly wrong... It looked unappetizing. The sauce had no flavor... It was one of the most bland and boring dishes I have had in a long while, which was especially sad for the 12$ price tag. Other restaurants give you steak in a bowl for about the same price. When I asked the waiter about the difference between the beef I got and another beef on the menu he said 'they're the same beef, the sauce comes out of the same packet...' really? Your sauce comes out of a packet...super glad I'm paying 12$ for that. Additionally, our waters were never refilled and we were checked in once throughout the meal. We spent over 70$ for a wholly disappointing experience. Wouldn't be back, wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Once again, Yelpers. You rock! My hubby and I were out visiting and was looking for an easy sushi place. This came up on our radar and on a whim decided to go. At first look, this place is in a strip mall... hmmmm. Not exactly what I expected. Concrete floors. Worn tables and plastic chairs. But the bar -- nice and inviting. Ahhhh.  We pulled up a chair to the bar and settled in. Yelpers told us to say hi to Mo. So we asked. And lo and behold, Mo is the owner who was asking what we would like. We asked for his recommendation -- the yellowtail fish. And I was in the mood for a salad.  Kicked off with the seaweed salad. If a seaweed salad can knock your socks off, this one did. Just the right amount of dressing. Incredibly clean and cool tasting. I knew we were in for the night!   While we ate, we talked to Mo, who is actually from Toyama, Japan, and has had his own sushi bar for some time. He spoke broken English but that doesn't get in the w;ay of his great sense of humor and welcoming manner. And before I know it, we start talking to the person next to us who is none other than the concierge for The Boulders and this is one of his favorite places to eat! Talk about an endorsement.   Mo sliced the fresh fish right before us with unbelievable ease and skill. Yellowtail practically melted in my mouth. The tuna nigiri completed the night.   We absolutely love sushi but I have to say this is the freshest and most authentic Japanese food I have found. And being authentic is what Mo is all about. No fancy decor. Just the freshest, well-prepared sushi you will ever have. So don't go expecting some lavish dining experience. If you like California rolls. Stay home. Want ridiculous Americanized sauces? Skip this place. But if you know good sushi, you will never want to leave this place. Just writing about Toyama has me jonesing for it once again. I guess I'll have to wait until we're back in that neck of the woods. Wah!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Toyama. We first ordered edamame and a Perrier. The waiter delivered the edamame, the bowl was half full. We asked if we could have a bit more to make the bowl full. His answer was no. Then came the Perrier. He brought the glass with the Perrier in it. We never saw the bottle. After a while, I asked if there was anything left in the bottle. He answered yes, do you want the rest. As a matter of fact, yes we do.We paid for the bottle. We then told the waiter that we were leaving and that we felt the service was unacceptable. He said OK. This was quite a disappointment."}
{"text":"Hidden up in a strip mall, on the the border between civilization and desert expanse is Toyama, a small authentic Japanese restaurant focusing on some excellent sushi. My partner and I sat at the sushi bar so that we could watch the two Japanese chefs in action, chat a bit with them, and eat toro hand rolls delivered fresh from by their hands. The toro hand roll was amazing, as were the nigiri we ordered - ama ebi, hotate, and aji. The sushi rice was spot on. We also tried the tuna tataki (yum), asparagus sauté, and the black cod dinner. The house salad which came with the dinner was also really good, with some fresh ginger carrot miso dressing. The only thing I didn't like quite as much was the black cod, which was just different than I expected, but still tasty. I cannot wait to be back for some more delicious sushi."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious (I had sushi).  My friend had chicken teriyaki and it looked a little generic, but she said it was really good.  My Mom also had sushi but has some food allergies.  They were very flexible and made her exactly what she needed at a great price.  They also allowed me to make some substitutions when I ordered a sushi sampler.  That was great too.  The service itself was a little touch and go.  We were one of two tables in there (went for a very early dinner right when they opened) and our water glasses were empty for long periods of time and although accommodating, the waiter wasn't very nice."}
{"text":"We stopped here tonight based upon a number of yelp reviews and were very pleased.  The food was high quality and appealing and the service was very good. We each had Miso soup; I had vegetable tempura which came with a nice green salad and rice.  My pal had the \"sushi dinner A\" which also came with the green salad.  This is a place we will highly recommend and also visit again."}
{"text":"Toyama is hidden in the Safeway shopping center. It's small place that has very loyal Japanese customers. We placed a Togo order as we were in the mood to staying in. We ordered tonkatsu which came with a bowl of rice and side salad. The pork was a thick cut and crispy bread crumbs made this dish very tasty.  The Chirashi Togo had nice chunks of real crab meat which I thought was very nice and large Ikura fish eggs added nice saltiness to the dish. I really enjoyed this dish as they give you variety of fish slices (not overload on tuna like many other places do). The poke special was amazing. I think it was my favorite out of everything we ordered. It was flavorful and had just right amount of seasoning. I ate it with white rice and it was yummy! I would like to order 3 (maybe 4) of these and make it a meal.  The reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was the serving size. I wish everything was slightly bigger even if they had to charge more."}
{"text":"The best sushi in town.  Not for those who want creative rolls.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  They can be delicious. But this place is Japanese.  For the best experience, go omakase with owner, Mo.  He knows what he's doing."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite sushi place...it has ruined us for any other sushi bar!  Mo's fish is so incredibly fresh, and the way he preps it the fish is like butter...melts in your mouth!  So authentically Japanese, their food is big on flavor!  We love the staff and they treat us like family."}
{"text":"From the outside... Questionable... but once inside... very happy to experience this location.  The food is greatly prepared and the staff is readily available throughout the entire time.  Will be going back and definitely recommend."}
