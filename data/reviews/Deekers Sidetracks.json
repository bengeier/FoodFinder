{"text":"I went to Deekers as part of a bar crawl. We wanted a place we could show up for a short amount of time, play some games, drink some beer and move out quickly. Deekers was perfect for what we needed. I spoke with the owner beforehand to help plan, and he was super helpful and accommodating. I'd go back to Deekers in a heartbeat to spend more time. It's a little off the beaten path, but I thought was pretty cool inside."}

{"text":"It's honestly my favorite go to bar. There's a Touch Tunes Juke Box that works with an app on your phone to play music. They have 4 pool tables, darts, sand volley ball courts, corn hole, and three separate bars. It kind of has that homey feel, and most the people are really welcoming and laid back. The bar food is pretty typical, but some of the bar tenders have specialties that they make if you ask them. It has it's busier days and it's chill days, but not normally overly crowded by any means. Worth a visit."}
