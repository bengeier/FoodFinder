{"text":"been going here for years. one of the best soup spots in the area. I have never been disappointed. I have even tried a few here that I normally wouldn't eat and was not let down.
They have very fast service and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"This is a quality place! The chicken dumpling soup is great and portions are large, you won't walk away hungry. Aside from the food, the staff is the best! On one occasion I went on a Saturday and didn't realize they had just closed. I had just wanted to get a Pepsi and the woman working was so sweet she went ahead and gave it to me anyways despite being closed. This is a great place with friendly staff and yummy food; and its nice to get away from the chain places."}
{"text":"The food is still great, but the Tower City location used to have excellent service. Not so much recently...They lost 2 of my orders this week and they probably need to fix their order (computer) system."}
{"text":"Great soups for lunch, however, it is a bit pricey. I think a grilled cheese and a cup of soup is 8 bucks. I would be happy to pay that price if they ever got my order right. I have stopped going there due to their lack of consistency. If you order a sandwich or a salad be prepared for something to go wrong; trust me, I warned you.

Also, on a side note I do believe this is a religious affiliated restaurant ( I am pretty sure all of these people go to the same church and one of them is a pastor). When you sit in the dining area you will see  pictures of Jesus and a painted picture of \"they kingdom come\". I am not sue if you want to spend your money there knowing that, just thought I would throw it out there."}
{"text":"I am staying at the Renaissance Marriott so...
1. Super convenient location!!
2. The Ruben was amazing!!!!!
3. They gave my Preggy new soup when it was too salty for her at no charge!!!

This place is really nice, super clean and very welcoming. The lady who changed out Preggy's soup even checked on her to make sure that soup was better which she and the bun seemed to really like."}
{"text":"Our whole office loves Susy's soup. Delicious soup with good salad & half sandwich options. We have them deliver to E.22, which is impressive from Tower City.  The only drawback is their site is out of date and you can't order online.  Pick up the phone and call for the \"real\" menu. The order and enjoy the great soup!"}
{"text":"I can see how people like this place.  It's cute, cozy and comfortable.  It has free wifi and it's located in an ideal spot for the business lunchers.  I was excited when I walked in because I'm totally a soup/salad/sandwich person.  Even though there were about 10 soups on the menu, I was disappointed with the selection.  And they only had one vegetarian soup--black bean.  Everything else was chicken and beef based.  I don't eat red meat, or pork.  I don't mind chicken, but I'm really picky about it and it has to be whiter than white.

I ended up ordering a chicken salad sandwich on white and a cup of chicken noodle soup.  The cashier couldn't hear anything I said for some reason and she kept asking me the same thing over and over again.  What type of bread?  White, please.  What type of bread would you like?  Um, white.  Thanks.  Type of bread for your sandwich?  I don't get it.  It wasn't that loud in there and I spoke clearly each time.

The chicken noodle soup was full of dark meat chicken, gross.  I ate around and slurped up the broth and waited for my sandwich.  It came, and was also full of dark meat chicken.  Gross.  The bread was soggy and wtf are those green things in my chicken salad?  Grapes?  Disgusting.  I had to dissect the sandwich and scrape off all the gross shit and then reassemble it.  I would have trashed the whole thing but I was starving.

The only reason I give this place 2 stars is because there's free wifi (but then again, I think that it's all throughout Tower City) and the guy that brought out my sandwich was really upbeat and always had a smile on his face, asking me a couple times if everything was alright and if he could get me anything--rare for a counter service type of place."}
{"text":"I got the Corned Beef and Chicken Tortilla soup today. Definitely one of my favorites. Soup has a little kick to it just the way it should be. 

Owner is a trained Soup Chef and it shows. There is no better Soup in  the CLE !"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  Had the lobster bisque and had a food orgasm!  YUM!  Also had the honey mustard chicken wrap which was good, too.  This place is a must for anybody visiting Cleveland.  It's in Tower City, next to the Renaissance Hotel."}
{"text":"First of all, kudos to Susy's for NOT being located in the food court.  Makes this place so classy, haha.   

Anyway, BEST SOUP EVER. 

I love the Chicken and Dumpling soup, the Minestrone and the delectable Chicken Paprikash and Chicken with Wild Rice.  The service is super fast, if you beat the lunchtime rush, and the soup is always spot on.  The bread's always a little tough for me, but I can overlook it because the soup is so awesome.   This place is a hidden gem.   Visit as often as you can."}
{"text":"The soup was fantastic, however it could have been the fact I was freezing from being out in the cold. Salad was marginal. The service was typical for a deli type fast food restaurant.  The pricing was average. Good for a quick bite, but not going to be on my frequents list."}
{"text":"I have been to the Halle Bldg location several times. The Soup is very good as is the Chili. The service is quick, even with a line you will be out quickly. I have learned to get there early as the favorites do sell out early."}
{"text":"The sandwiches and wraps are ok but the soup is where Susy's excels. The chicken paprikash and chicken dumpling are entire meals by themselves."}
{"text":"My girls came downtown to have lunch with me. This was our first time eating there.
The staff were nice but not very helpful and were either clueless or were not willing to tell us about their menu.
Our food was good and the service was quick, but is was not really memorable.
I had an egg salad sandwich and a cup of clam chowder.
I will comeback again to have lunch but when my girls come downtown to eat with me I think we will check out East 4th."}
{"text":"The soup here is second only to their staff. Working downtown Cleveland near 14th and Euclid I frequent the soup stand in the Halle Building. They have a guy that runs this stand; Jeff, from morning until something like 2pm, when it closes for the day. This guy is the friendliest, more polite; helpful restaurant employee I have ever come across; anywhere. Yeah its just a soup stand with several varieties of homemade goodness. The soups are outstanding (the sandwiches overpriced and just fair. Love the Broccoli Cheese, Lobster Bisque, and Clam Chowder.

Stop down and see Jeff; he will make sure you have a sample of everything they are offering that day and have you smiling or laughing your way to your seat.  I suspect it wont be long before a someone rolls by and tries to hire this guy!"}
{"text":"Thick, flavorful, delicious soup, with complimentary bread of your choice and a side of friendly service, all for around $5? Yes please!!! 

There are so many soup options, and all are yummy! The classic grilled cheese also hits the spot. This is why I've been back consecutive days for lunch, and why so many Tower City workers make this THE go-to quick lunch spot. 

Whether dining in the bustling booths or grabbing quick cubicle-lunch-to-go, Susy's will ensure you do indeed \"have a SOUPer day!\""}
{"text":"I work in Tower City and Susy's is my favorite lunch spot. Their soups are hearty and flavorful, especially the Chicken and Dumpling. A bowl served with your choice of a roll or cornbread muffin for around $5 is a great deal."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!  Clean, great food and always consistent. My favorites are the Caesar Salad, Turkey Ciabatta, and the Grilled Cheese with Bacon and Tomato. Great people and so much positive energy!"}
{"text":"It took 20 minutes for them to bring me a Chicken Salad Sandwich.  The food is okay, nothing spectacular by any means.  Tower Deli has better breakfast and friendlier employees.   If you need a bite for lunch and this is your only option, then by all means get a sandwich or a wrap.  The chicken salad was bland, although the cashews were a nice touch."}
{"text":"Fantastic buffalo chicken wrap or ranch chicken wrap. Black bean soup, cheese potato soup are my favorite. Okay clam chowder & Italian wedding soup. I will be back. Plan on an early lunch or you will wait in line. Not a long wait, just may not find a table."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I walked in and I was tapped by the customer in front of me and informed that I was stalking an employee. I do not know any of the employees nor have I spoken to any of the employees prior to coming in today. I casually turned around and walked out. I called the manager informed him of this blatant character assassination and he said he would check into it and call me back. I am encouraging anyone who values their character not to patronize this place. Take your hard earned money to establishments where you will not be falsely accused of stalking."}
{"text":"Great soup....great variety.....really really friendly staff.  I wrote a quick tip and I'll post it here that every third Friday of the month they have Manhattan Clam Chowder.  When I don't go out for lunch, this is my first choice.  Its the old Panera Bread and located away from the nasty roach laden food court.  They also offer 4 different sizes of soups."}
{"text":"This place gets good reviews for a reason--excellent sandwiches.  I wouldnt hesitate to go back if I was in Cleveland again.  The Turkey Bacon avocado wrap (ex the dressing) was terrific.  The reuben looked awesome too"}
{"text":"This afternoon I went there for a late lunch. I arrived at about 2:05 p.m. I was automatically greeted by a young lady, who seemed a little frazzled. If you've ever been to Susy's during lunch, you'd understand why. As always, there was a line to actually place your order and the \"order pickup\" line on the opposite side, was just as long, if not longer. I already knew what I wanted and proceeded to order the half a turkey sandwich and the chicken wild rice soup. Well, needless to say I was disappointed for the first time. My soup came out quickly, which is typical but it was cold. I also did not get the Italian bread that comes along with it. The weird thing is, she asked me what kind of bread I wanted. I grabbed a table to wait for my sandwich, while eating my cold soup. The gentleman that brings your sandwich to you, is always very nice. As soon as he sat the sandwich down in front of me, I knew that it was just a sandwich. There was lettuce and tomatoes on it but no mayo. I do recall, not even being asked if I wanted mayo on my sandwich or not. I had to run back to the opposite counter for that! A little mayo on a sandwich goes a long way! Needless to say, I was disappointed today and probably will be bringing my lunch the rest of the week. At least this way I know what I'm getting and homemade sandwiches are always, just the way I like 'em! Giving Susy's a thumbs down today, fellow Yelpers. If I ever decide to return, hopefully, they'll have a new cashier that's more attentive and helpful to their customers. Hope your next visit is way better than my last! Happy Yelping!"}
{"text":"I had a delicious white bean turkey chili. The bowl only cost me $5 and it was served with a fantastic piece of bread. The service are also very friendly and are speedy about processing orders. I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I've been here probably twenty times, but sad (or proud) to say I've only ever ordered one item - pint of beef chili, with cornbread or their rustic italian. Order a side of jalapenos and you're good to go. Good size chunks of beef, an assortment of beans and other veggies, and you have one of the best chilis in the state. Make sure to go before 12:30 to ensure they don't run out! The staff here is exceptionally helpful and friendly, and offer samples of soups in case you can't make up your mind."}
{"text":"Jessica made me laugh with her food court comment. Yes, I am so glad this place isn't in the food court after that local news expose...(you are probably better in the dark). 

Susy's is a welcome addition to those of us in the office buildings around Tower City. If it's cold or rainy expect the line to be out the door, but it does move quickly. Tuesdays and Thursdays are also popular because everyone loves the Chicken Paprikash. There is a lot of variety each day, which I love. Overall the quality is pretty good, too. I think the only soup I haven't liked here was the gumbo (too much okra slime). The rolls aren't much to write home about (generic, store bought type) so I usually opt for the crackers. 

They also offer a variety of fresh made sandwiches. I like the grilled cheese with tomato and bacon. Pass on the smoothies though, they have a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"This place, by far, has the best breakfast burrito I've ever had! Everything is made hot and fresh. Nothing comes from the package. YOU MUST TRY IT :)"}
{"text":"Great selection of soup and the quality is very good and $5 lunch is a great sweet-spot for lunch. I frequent the location in the Halle building since I work around Playhouse Square. I particularly like the Chicken Paprikash, Lobster Bisque, Tomato Tortellini, Black Bean. And REALLY the best part is Jeff - the man that runs the show in the Halle location is super friendly and fun ta' boot. However, I just went down today and apparently no longer works there. OHHH so sad. I hope it's good for him though but I will not likely go down as much after Jeff is gone. :-("}
{"text":"This review is for their food truck. I had the grilled cheese and spicy vegetarian chili. The grilled cheese was done just right. The chili had a nice kick to it. Definitely a good find."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST! I eat here quite often. The menu changes daily but there are usually 10 soups or so to choose from. My favorite is chicken and dumpling and the broccoli cheese. They actually start making the soups at 5am every day! So they're fresh and homemade. There are also sandwiches if you're not feeling soup in the summer. The dining area is always clean and the staff is awesome. They talk to you and joke around with everyone. I have never heard a bad thing about anyone's visit. 
There is a line usually starting around 1130 till 1230 so go before or after. Like line out the door line. 
It's the place to be!
Updated with pics and prices in pics!"}
{"text":"Favorites are broccoli cheese and chicken paprikash. Never tried the sandwiches, soup is  so filing on its own i never ventured out."}
{"text":"This would be a 5-star review for the small cart that they have set up in the basement food court of the Halle Building closer to E.14th and Euclid if it wasn't for the creep working the cash register who wouldn't leave this young lady alone! He shook my hand, asked my name, and made other comments that went past friendly into creep zone. 

BUT the soup is so damn good (tomato tortellini im lookin at you) I'm gonna have to go back as the weather gets colder and either pray Creepy Cashier isn't there, or get in and get out as quick as possible."}
{"text":"Perfect timing for a soup/deli to open up right across the street from my work. In this cold, walking across town isn't an option and there aren't many good choices close by, so checked this out as soon as I noticed it was open (whoops it took me a minute). They have a lot of different soup options along with sandwiches and wraps. I tried the Vegetarian panini and LOVED it - Cucumbers, carrots, onions, spinach, cheese and honey mustard. Yum! I also added a cup of butternut squash, and my total was just under $10 - which is definitely comparable to other locations in the area. Will definitely be frequenting this spot now!"}
{"text":"Best place in tower city for ppl working tower city office bldgs. You'll get yummy and healthy soups. I bet u visited couple of more times after ur first visit.
I love chicken and dumpling, paprikashi, veg chilli and black beans soups."}
{"text":"I eat here ahbout 3-4 times a week. Super good and people are nice.( The bread lady does get mad from time to time because i don't get bread because they don't have butter) This is a wonderful place to eat at lunch so don't skip it."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite soup places downtown! The fact that I work in Tower City makes this place the best in the Fall, Winter or Spring when the weather isn't so great outside. Their options of soups are incredible and each of the ones I've tried have been delicious. Their salads and sandwiches are huge for the price. The service is always so quick and everyone working there is very friendly. 

There is nothing better than the tomato tortellini soup with a grilled cheese sandwich on a rainy cold day. Or a fresh spinach salad on a hot summer day. 

I haven't tried anything here that I haven't fallen in love with and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Susy's serves up some yummy soup each and every day.  I used to visit frequently when they were located on Public Square, but I have yet to visit their new location inside Tower City.

Anyway, in addition to the soup, the sandwiches and salads are pretty good too.  I've eaten many a chef salad here and never been disappointed - they're made fresh daily.  I've tried their egg salad wrap, it's yummy, if not a bit on the small side.

Most of the time, I'd get a soup and sandwich combo.  All of the soups are really good."}
{"text":"Had the club sandwich and chicken noodle coop.  Both were very good!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Tomato Tortellini soup. Unfortunately when I got to the soup pick-up line, I was told the pot was empty and there would be a short wait. Later I was told they ran out of it completely. The lady dishing out the soup was really nice though and managed well about a half dozen others in the same situation. I ended up going for the Spicy Veggie Chili. It was really good and I would order it again.

When I ordered I was told the soup came with a choice of a side: crackers, cornbread or rustic Italian bread. I chose the Italian bread expecting some hard crusted nearly baguette style bread, but I was underwhelmed by a slice of bread in a zip-lock baggie. 

I also got a turkey sandwich which was basic, but fine. It came with lettuce and a tomato and a pickle on the side. There was a choice of either mayo or mustard and also a choice of white, multi-grain or rye bread. The sandwich could be ordered either half or whole or as a wrap as well.

I ate in, so was given a number to take to my table so someone could bring my sandwich to me. Regardless though you have to queue to collect your soup. They don't bring soup to you even if you are dining in I guess. 

The guy that brought my food was nice. The lady dishing out the soup was really friendly. Unfortunately the lady taking my order was having a bad day and let it show. 

Susy's is located one level below the Public Square entrance level. Northeastern section. They literally moved right into the old Panera and did little to change the look of the place from the benches to the trash cans."}
{"text":"My favorite place for soup! I have visited the Tower City location lots of times. It's on the bottom level of tower city where panera used to be. Nice big dining area. I've also been to the location in the Halle building, although that one has a limited menu for sandwiches. I wish the chicken tortilla was a daily soup. It's the best chicken tortilla I've ever had. They also have a great chicken paprikash."}
{"text":"5 star review right here! The quality of soup I've come to expect from the original Susy's Soup in tower city but now with extended hours! 7AM-7PM, better parking and great food, what more could you need?! I'm a fan of the soups and sandwiches and am very happy to say this location is just as good as the main one. Ample dining area, friendly staff, adequate parking (for downtown!) and extended hours. Very happy to have visited this location and plan to continue"}
{"text":"Susy's has a great lunch menu - soup, salad, wraps, grilled cheese, even quesadillas (a special some days). 

My favorite is the turkey, bacon, avocado wrap. Each wrap comes with carrot and celery sticks and a pickle. Soups come with your choice of bread, roll or corn bread.

I also like the sunshine salad which has strawberries and mandarin oranges. Light and yummy.

It can get a little busy at lunchtime, but the line moves quick. Soup comes out very fast, salads, wraps and sandwiches take a bit longer, but it's still a good option for lunch. It's especially nice if you don't want to walk outside when it's cold or rainy!"}
