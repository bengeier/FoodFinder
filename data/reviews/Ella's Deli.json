{"text":"the kids LOVE it but I didn't actually eat the food because I was too grossed out. really cute for kids though"}
{"text":"Excellent deli food, great ice cream, and a crazy fun atmosphere.  It's definitely a place that needs to be seen to be understood.

The food itself is not extraordinary but quite good for the style.  There are other places I would recommend for \"just food\" in Madison, but the atmosphere and environment add so much to the experience.  I would recommend this as a place to check out for lunch, probably not dinner.  

The ice cream is also a great after-meal treat.  They come in a variety of great flavors."}
{"text":"You can skip this place. We thought this would be a fun place during a day trip to Madison, but it's just not worth it. The novelty items around the restaurant are broken, the food is overpriced and rather gross. I'm not sure how you mess up chicken strips, but my daughter said they tasted funny so she didn't eat them. She lives fries and didn't eat this either. The milk shake we ordered was itty bitty.  Perhaps, they should tell new customers it's a baby shake if you order one with a meal. The service was incredibly slow, yet it's a weekday on off peak hours. It shouldn't take 20 minutes for basically fast food, nor should I need to ask for extra napkins when food is set down and spilling. 
We tried to order ice cream to go and the guy in front of us ordered a double. I can't even imagine what a mini or single scoop looks like. Complete rip off and kids asked to go someplace else!"}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars for a mix of food and atmosphere + merry-go-round outside.
Great place for young kids/toddlers, especially to ride the carousel.
I gave it 4 at first, but after reading what I wrote, 4 did not seem accurate.

When it comes to the food I can only comment on the entrees, not the desserts, which are clearly a whole other specialty of theirs, seems like they would be good, but also it seems like it's an either or situation, either a meal, or a big dessert.

If I go back, I'm honestly happy just having a burger and fries, good coffee shop/deli style burger and fries.

I fantasize that the corned beef or pastrami is awesome like the kind I can get in Chicago at Manny's, or what used to be Kaufman's, but the reality is quite different, for the price they should pile the cb or p on high, like real deli's in Chicago or NYC do, but noooooo! (as Belushi used to say). Skimpy, penny pinching, the pickles are good. The rye bread is not substantial enough, too crumbly, too weak. The cb and p is mediocre at best, weak flavor, not fatty enough, and I prefer lean, but this is too lean, it's not really good and certainly no where near great. A definite letdown.

So to sum it up, for Madison, for Wisconsin, I guess if you're desperate for a cb or p sandwich on rye with a pickle, in a \"deli\", then this is your ONLY choice. If you want to drive 3 hours to Chicago and go to Manny's you will know what a real CB or P sandwich is, and forever after will not settle for less, unless you deceive yourself and live in denial, or are stuck somewhere, wherein the choices are non-existent like Madison or Wisconsin in general.

Sigh, what's with the mediocre food in Wisconsin, sad."}
{"text":"Expensive.  Bland food.  Terrible service.  Loud atmosphere.  Three people on a Saturday afternoon ordering simple dishes took almost an hour.  I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Sadly, Ella's Deli continues its decent towards total failure.
I decided to try the deli for the 12th time in the past year, and the quality of the place has dropped even lower than before. 

The prices have been hiked yet again, the portions
have shrunk again, the waitstaff has been reduced in number AGAIN, and the most upsetting thing that has happened to this once great deli is the fact the place is filthy. 

They really need to close for a good week and clean the place from top to bottom. Want to know how bad this once great Madison attraction has fallen? I saw a roach crawling around on floor. A freaking ROACH. As in the creepy crawly kind - not the Willy Street kind. :)

This makes me so sad as this place was once a true landmark for Madison. Now it is hanging on a thread - only getting by due to the animatronic toys and gadgets. If this were any other Resturant, it would have closed down years ago.

Sad."}
{"text":"Love this place! The nostalgia the food the service... Love love love. Summer time and the ice cream the carousel. Makes me so happy!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here to eat before we went to see Marilyn Manson at the Orpheum and I was surprised how packed it was on a Tuesday afternoon.  Our waitress was friendly, food was delicious and hot, however it seemed to take forever to get refills or our food.

I would gladly come back, just hoping for a slightly better experience on my next go-around."}
{"text":"Ella's is always entertaining for the kids despite the fact that many of the \"moving\" toys on the ceiling and walls are broken. But what really turned me off were the prices.

A turkey rueben on average-sized bread with three or four slices of meat was $8.19. For $2.20 more you get a small pile of fries and shot glass full of coleslaw on the plate. A Mr. B Burger with a tablespoon of coleslaw and some special sauce on a soft onion bun was $6.20. It looked small and lonely without any fries and I couldn't keep from thinking that I could have gotten something similar at the BK down the road for a third of the price. With sundaes starting at $5.50 we packed up and headed elsewhere."}
{"text":"Epic fail. Overpriced, not even fair tasting food, lousy service.  If you want to pay $8 for a sandwich far worse than you can make at home using prepackaged deli meats from the grocery store then by all means, this is your place.  It may have been good once and they may have had pride in the \"deli\" aspect, but that has long since been abandoned for motorized gadgets attached to the ceiling and the carousel out front.  Kids may be amused by the place, but you will be annoyed when you (finally) get your food and then move closer to enraged when you see your bill.  Go to Chucky Cheese instead."}
{"text":"HUGE menu.  They have one ~20 page menu for food, and another entirely different menu for the ice cream, shakes, etc.

The main menu is primarily deli standards, so if you're looking to get a tongue sandwich on rye, here's the place.  But they also have burgers and other American food.

The main reason I go here is their Chicken Matzo Ball soup, which you can only get a couple other places in Madison.  Tasty, but I wish it had more chicken, it's usually just chicken dust.  Manna Cafe on Sherman Ave. has much better Chicken Matzo Ball soup with fresh veggies, lots of chicken and a side of fresh bread - but they only make it on Fridays currently, so I end up at Ella's usually.

Otherwise, barring their lunch specials, the place is really expensive for what you get.  $9 for salami on a toasted bagel with no sides?  It tasted great, but I can make that myself at home for $1.50, even using \"artisan\" salami.

Ella's is a great place for kids.  Tons of moving animated puppets and things flying around the ceilings (which are made by one of the owners).  Games that kids can play, and even some of the tables are interactive.  They also have a carousel open during the warm months.

You can also reserve the place for birthday parties, and they have a bunch of different packages depending on your budget.

Since it's such a kids kind of place, and you have all those things whirring around the restaurant, it's pretty noisy, even when almost empty.

3 stars for prices in relation to quality and amount of food for us adults, but a neat place for kids or people visiting Madison."}
{"text":"This place is a kid's dream! Tons of animated toys and terrific ice cream. We didn't have a meal, just dessert. For such a cheerful place all the staff looked pissed to be working. Maybe it is all the sensory overload? I like that the menu has a baby plate for kids 1 and under with a variety of soft foods. We'll definitely return on our next trip to Madison!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I can help clarify the reasons one would eat at Ella's Deli.

Ella's is another Madison institution.  I used to go to the State St. location quite a lot in college.  It was laid out like a normal restaurant, *sans* toys hanging from every corner.  Funny story: before I knew better, I tried to order a BLT there.  That was the day I learned about what a kosher deli is.  Who says you don't learn anything useful in college?!

The last time we went to the east side location, it practically drove us insane.  Every object in the place is constantly spinning, moving, jumping, ringing, chirping, chiming. or otherwise distracting your attention the entire time you're there.  It NEVER EVER lets up for a second.

The food is completely average deli food.  Always has been.  Decently made, decent ingredients, absolutely nothing to write home about.  It is, however, massively over-priced for what it is.  Especially considering the sensory assault you have to endure while eating it, which just can't be good for the digestion.

IMHO, this place is a great place to take your kids.  They will have all kinds of weird stuff to watch, and it may even be distracting enough to get them off their game-boys for a minute.  hence the three-star rating, because there is at least this one reason to eat here.

Normal adults looking for normal food in a normal setting should avoid Ella's like the plague.  I hear Stalzy's is really good - I'll have to try them sometime soon!"}
{"text":"It had been a couple of years since we took our children to Ella's and time has not improved things. It used to be a place with slightly overpriced but reasonable food and an interesting ambiance for the kids. The prices are still there but food quality, if our visit is any example, has dropped considerably. My son got a hamburger that was so small it couldn't be seen without opening the bun. It was over poked and dry as well. My reuben sandwich could be charitably described as a sauerkraut sandwich with a lot of russian dressing and just a hint of corned beef (less than two shavings thick). Soggy toasted bread rounded out the entree. My wife's 'superb owl' of soup was quite a large bowl on a very large platter containing about an inch of soup (The best of the three meals)!

It's too bad when such an effort is made seemingly to cut costs. I guess diners are noticing. Ella's used to have a line almost every day for lunch. Today (a Friday at 12:25pm) we we seated also immediately. What a shame that a Madison landmark I have dined at now and again for years has lost it's way. Too many other choices for the kids now. I will go elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is interesting, but the noise created by all the whirliegigs is as loud as a bar on Friday night.  The service was terrible, even for a sandwich place.  I was one of four tables, two tables per server.  She walked away as she spoke, she didn't refill water, and was pretty clueless when it came to the menu.  The food was meh at best.  I tried the Lox Salad.  Some lox, nicely flavored, accompanied by a handful of pathetic looking lettuce and a few spoon fulls of rice on an enormous plate for $10.  Presentation was clearly not a consideration.  I want to support local businesses but if given the choice between Ella's and a chain bagel shop, the chain would win hands down in overall experience, food quality, atmosphere, and service."}
{"text":"Just stopped by Ella's after going by there for years.  Was hoping for a better experience.  I paid $10 dollars for a roast beef sandwich with a small pickle Slice and shit glass of coleslaw.  The roast beef was so brown it looked very old with no taste.  I spend a lot of time and money eating out and probably would never go here or recommend to anyone.  Nothing like any deli I have ever been to and not worth the time or money.

I really wanted to like the place"}
{"text":"While Ella's deli might not have some of the best food in town, it does have the electricity bill.  Therein lies the real reason you should visit, the explosion of gadgetry, mechanical toys, mouse-trap style novelties, and all around eye candy make Ella's the only restaurant I know of where its permissible to get up and wander around wide-eyed at this little shop of curiosities. 

If you have strong impulses towards cold-cuts, potato salad, reubens, and ice cream or a small convoy of children with frequently shifting attention spans Ella's will be perfect.

For those looking for a bit more culinary sophistication or higher quality shy away from the American foods and learn towards the more kosher elements.  The chicken in my Caesar salad was actually so stale it was send-back worthy.  But for a place with a carousal outside and an interior that's been as constant as bologna fallen behind the stove, Ella's makes for a nice one time excursion of new sights and sounds."}
{"text":"What could be more fun than Ella's?  The food is good too!

First time here after my daughter was diagnosed with Celiac and needs a strict gluten free diet.  They made her a sandwich on GF bread.  Sh ordered mashed potatoes as her side and the waiter came back with the ingredients from the mashed potatoes to make sure it was ok!   So great!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Some of the food is excellent; the soups, the salads, the ice cream, and it's a fun atmosphere for kids, but I wish it were a little cleaner, and sometimes the food isn't delivered as described on the menu, and it was a little weird to go to the checkout with my un-totaled tab to have the host ask me what I wanted to tip. Well, they hadn't given me a totaled tab at the table, or shown me the itemized receipt so I could a) check to see if it was correct, and b) calculate the tip."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for kids and great menu for vegetarians.  Lots to see, great service."}
{"text":"Bad food, overpriced, bad service. And this was at 3 in the afternoon when it was dead. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"We stopped in at 1:00PM on a Saturday with our two grandchildren.   After waiting to be seated, we ended up waiting 45 minutes for our food. For a while, the children were entertained by all the decor, but got antsy before too long.  The food was not quite as good as Culver's (but twice as expensive), the burgers were overcooked, fries were bland.   Nothing was very hot.     

We mentioned the wait to the waitress who had nothing in particular to say about it, other than they were busy.  We then mentioned it to the manager, who just said \"sorry\".   Frustrating experience.    We won't return."}
{"text":"Ella's is a great place for kids. Great decor and they even have a carousel! The food is pretty good, not amazing. Often loud and crowded. I would recommend the Reuben or the matzo ball soup. I love the strawberry cheesecake ice cream. - chocolate shoppe??? 3 for adults. 5 for children."}
{"text":"The other day I walked in with the hopes of walking out with an amazing Reuben sandwich. Instead I walked in to a sad-looking group of employees in the kitchen. I asked where do I order food? They weren't very busy looking at all, so I was confused. Each person bounced me around until I decided to just leave, and in summary never will I return...even when my  daughter is of age to ride their creepy looking merry-go-round & their lack of desire to take an order (over $20) made me lose my appetite. I took my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fun place for families,  my salami was tough, the bread was a bit stale. Slow service too"}
{"text":"Many fond memories of taking our young children to Ella's a generation ago. Today we took our young grandchildren there for a special treat. Abysmal. Dirty. Slow service. Stale bread. Burned hamburger. Cold hotdog. Not good."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I used to like Ella's and I think their premise is unique and awesome but if only their food and desserts could match the atmosphere....

The last time I was there, I took my out of town parents there for dessert. After perusing the sticky menu binder (seriously, why is the menu a binder?), the unfriendly waiter took our order. Black & white delight sundae for me, root beer float for mom, and can't remember what dad ordered.  Everything was just.....meh.  Seems like Ella's is simply resting on their laurels. Maybe they could take some pointers from other ice cream parlors such as Fenton's Creamery in Oakland, CA where the food is good, ice cream is delicious, and there are lines out the door.  

Sorry but now when I think of getting ice cream, I don't think of going to Ella's.  I instead think of the Chocolate Shoppe or maybe even Michael's. If they gave the place a hose down, dusted off some of the kitschy mechanical's, and slimmed down the menu a bit, Ella's might be able to compete with other establishments who are just doing it better."}
{"text":"Everyone, more especially kids, will enjoy this restaurant.  Antique mechanical games abound, including figures moving across the ceiling.  Some tables have games under a glass top that customers can play.

Food is excellent, especially the baked potatoes, matzo ball soup, and sandwiches.  Prices are reasonable.   Rstaurant is packed at lunch and dinner.

Other than in wintertime, a full-sized carousel operates outside."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is the first thing you notice. It's definitely more suited for kids, but it can be fun for adults as well. 
The food is typical diner/American food, which means it's fatty and greasy and ha peavy, so if that's what you're feeling, then this place fits. The desserts are decent as well, but the food here is not great enough for us to come back or crave."}
{"text":"Revising my previous review. Last year, went Ella's twice and the service was very poor to say the least.

Today, we went back to at least soak up the atmosphere with a few kids who hadn't been there before. We had Gregory as our waiter, and, based on Gregory, the consensus for Ella's went from one star to five stars. I hope Gregory and his light, fun attitude is what pervades the rest of the wait staff. People go to Ella's to have fun, and their server is at least 50% of the equation -- they don't have to be comedians, just be friendly, courteous, and attentive -- Gregory was all those things. The food was good, and we got it quick. Definitely a good night."}
{"text":"We went here on a recent visit to Madison with our kids after riding the Polar Express train.  If you're not a fan of clowns and circus stuff surounding you at every turn, don't go here.  If you are looking for outstanding food, don't go here either.  After paging through the 30 page binder they call their menu, our table had a Chicago style hot dog, meatloaf and mashed potatoes, a cheeseburger, a reuben sandwich and some soup.......  We all said the same thing after we left, \"well that was a disappointment\".

The kids really enjoyed themselves and ate most of their chicken tenders, I guess I haven't indoctrinated them enough yet into the belief that clowns and circus memorabilia  is evil.  Seriously, this may be a good place for desert and a quick look with the kids.  If you are looking for a great meal, keep looking."}
{"text":"If you go here for entertainment and ice cream (Chocolate Shoppe brand), you'll be satisfied. My daughter loved all the fun things spinning around the ceiling, and of course, the carousel outside ($1.50/ride, adults are free to join). Although they have a large menu, the food is expensive and mediocre at best. Reminds me of fair/event/concession stand food. So eat lunch elsewhere and then come here for dessert and some fun."}
{"text":"This is our 5th trip to this restaurant... if I could rate it a zero.. I would.   Each trip it has gone down hill. 

Nothing in our party of 9's food was good. The pasta was ice cold when it came, our rubens were Soggy and had barely any meat... it cost $14 for them with fries.. yes.. $14 each!! To add fries ot was $4.... for a very small amount of fries. 

Our daughter had the kids fish and fries... they are overlooked and in the shape of fish... (the inside did not resemble fish at all). 

A child a few booths down started vomiting, there were so many people touching the table and continuing to serve food.. I would not be surprised if there is an outbreak. 

We also ended the trip with ice cream. Our daughter ordered a $6.60 cherry ice cream soda as I watched them make it, it was spilling all over the counter and see them use different rags and touch the cup and spoon on the counter.. it was so gross. The drink tasted disgusting.. it appeared like she had no idea how to make it.. and it tasted the same. 

Save yourselves a trip, the atmosphere is cute.. but the food is over priced and not worth it."}
{"text":"What has happened to this place???  So loud all 4 adults left with blinding headaches.  Dirty dishes thrown - literally thrown- into bus tubs by wait staff made us jump every few minutes...we thought someone had dropped a tray full  of food on the floor.  We could not even talk to each other, way too loud. Service agonizingly slow.  When i got up and asked our server how much longer, she said it's coming up now.  I said \" no,  it's been up for 15 minutes, actually\" as we could see it.  The food is good, but prices really are high by anyone's standards.  Madison has plenty of great places to eat.  If you feel that your kids need this kind of over - stimulation, you need parenting lessons."}
{"text":"Horrible service, there was a kid working that looked about 13 years old. All the staff stands around talking and yapping. There is a sink full of ice that they go and dip their hands in without gloves and then fills the drinks up with ice.  The carousel operator watches his phone instead of the kids that are riding the ride. Asked for two banana splits and they didn't know how to make it... And that was 16 dollars. Never going here again!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place two stars for two reasons.   The first being the look of absolute wonderment on my son's face when we walked through the door.  He didn't know where to look.  The second would be because they are the only restaurant I've ever been to that offers a baby plate.  My daughter loved that even though when the menu says \"small amounts,\" it is entirely accurate.   

Now the bad,  which I never saw on any \"Things to do in Madison\" when I was researching the town in preparation of our move there.  I keep telling myself our waitress was just new,  as she seemed to be running constantly and assumed we only wanted drinks.   When my root beer float exploded all over the table,  I tried to mop it with the two napkins we received.   This didn't do the job,  so I waited calmly for the waitress to come back for our food order.  When she showed up, she ignored the mess and tried to flit away after hearing our drinks were good.  She didn't know the menu items and was unable to answer questions I had, but grabbed me a few more napkins so I could clean the mess up.  Food ordered, table sticky.  My three year old announces he has to pee,  which is bad since my husband took the oldest to the game shop, and I have the baby and the three year old by myself.   Our waitress figured out we hadn't left since she dropped the soup off and retreated before I could reach the table.   I had to retrive my son from the bathroom, and while making my way back to the table,  I notice a fella getting ready to bus the table, despite my bag sitting on it.   My soup in his hands, almost in the pan.  Should have let him take it.  The rest of the food took a while,  so we entertained ourselves playing the game that was part of the very sticky table... why didn't I let that fella bus the table?  Food arrives!   My daughter loved her baby plate, my son promptly dropped his corn dog on the floor, and I questioned the integrity of my meatloaf.  I know,  meatloaf is one of those hit or miss items.   In this case,  all the food (except the baby plate) looked like some one ran down to the local discount grocery store,  grabbed a few frozen dinners, heated them,  and served them at twice the price.  Blech!  The ice cream was nothing to write home about and for the cost of mine alone,  I could have gotten a pint of Ben and Jerry's.

Overall, not worth the time, money, or energy.   I may take the kids to ride the carrousel but honestly,  I've seen cleaner ones at county fairs."}
{"text":"I eat here usually with out-of-town guests who I want to have an interesting experience. And it never fails to disappoint. While the atmosphere is certainly unique, the place never seems clean, service is spotty at best and the food is generally below par, at best.

Most recent visit, I ordered a hot dog. I received a decent sized frank, but the bun was huge, way too big for the hot dog. Worst of all the bun was very, very stale. The dog itself wasn't great. Others at my table had similar disappointments. Thinking to the 8-10 times I have been to Ella's, the food pretty much stinks consistently. The only exception for me is the matzo ball soup, but even that seems watered down. Our server was ditzy and service was not fast by any means.

If you want a unique experience, this is a good choice. If good food is your goal, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"AWFUL PLACE. The French toast they tout as indescribable can't be described on the menu because the word they'd have to use is \"inedible\"-- it was dry and flavorless. The noise level due to some stupid overhead maze using billiard balls is similar to being in a bowling alley. The coffee tastes like dishwater and the server was disinterested at best--just dropped off our coffee and walked away. My husband had to go to the busing station to find the Splenda. This was our first and only visit."}
{"text":"Super fun place to take the kids. Go for the ambiance, stay for the indigestion. Great ice cream and, seriously satisfactory food. We had a great time on the old carousel, as well."}
{"text":"I came with a friend for dinner on a Friday night. The crazy ambiance was a complete surprise - moving toys all over the ceiling, themed shadowbox tables with moving parts inside, a functional deli counter, oldtimey candy like Orange Crush licorice for sale at the cash register. We were seated immediately and the waitress answered our questions about the menu. 

I had the open face Rueben sizzler (dresssing on the side) and loved it. The fries were great (I added salt and vinegar) as was the cole slaw. My friend had the lox platter with fries. We sat there for three hours talking and never felt a bit rushed by the wait staff. Our drinks were refilled as needed. We were too full to try the desserts, although I was intrigued by the pickle sundae!

I would love to come here again."}
{"text":"We stop with the kids whenever we get in the area. The food is good and the kids love the ambiance with all the animation. Unlike what others have said we have found the staff to be nice and honest hard workers. As far as the best midwest Ruben it's pretty darn good."}
{"text":"On a trip through Madison, my family stopped at this quaint restaurant based on a recommendation. First impression - cute, unique, noisy, busy, needed a little TLC, and an ADHD nightmare. We were seated at a table and a waitress showed up maybe ten minutes later. She took our order, brought our drinks, and after 40 minutes we asked when we might get our food. Her response, \"I couldn't begin to guess how long it will be.\" There was no assurance that she would check on it - it would come when it was set out by the cook. Great. Ten minutes go by and we see that the waitress has picked up plates that look like our order which has been sitting on the counter a little while. Of the three meals ordered, one was fine, another clearly had been sitting for a while and the bread on a sandwich had become a bit soggy, and the last, a cheeseburger, was extremely well done with much crunch at each bite. This especially was not going to work for us. We called the waitress over, explained the situation and asked for a new one. We asked if this could be made quickly as we'd already waited 40+ minutes for the meal delivered. She said she'd put the order in, but she didn't know how long it would take due to the orders ahead of us. Not a good answer. We asked for the manager, and explained the situation to her. She assures us she'll take care of it and will get it expedited. Twenty minutes later, we STILL did not have our food. That's it. We were done. We paid for the food eaten and left. 

I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone. It's a shame that customer service means absolutely nothing to them."}
{"text":"Oh please! Other than the desserts, which often come with dirty silverware, it's simply not worth it. The place is jam stuffed with toys, one would think at first glance, that it would be a mini paradise. Upon closer look, everything is filthy and dusty. The floors and tables are sticky. The prices are inflated and the waitstaff only occassionally friendly. I love good Jewish food. Ella's is not. The matzoh ball soup has no flavor and the blintzes are soggy. The sandwich meats are processed and the bread is dry. I would come for their famous #1 if I had to have a sugar fix, but it is most certainly not like the Ella's deli I remember on State Street from the late 1970's."}
{"text":"A place to bring the youth. Or be reminded of your own.  Amazing stuff in here.  You could look around for hours at all the stuff.  But you won't, because at least at lunch time, this place is crowded and so you better stay seated or else be in the way of servers or bussers.  
Paid over 80 dollars for 4 small adult lunches and 1 child.  Over priced much!? 
My MIL had a hair in her matzo (sp?) ball soup.  My husband liked the turkey on his sandwich and my grilled cheese with pepper jack was good.  We ordered a black and white split thinking it was a banana split with choc and vanilla ice cream but nope, there was no banana, just ice cream LOL ok.  
Husband said the men's bathroom reeked of smoke.  The women's did not but was so small only 2 stalls for a huge, kid's restaurant what?!?
Carousel was carousel-ey.  My baby wasn't impressed but my 4 year old niece loved it.  Only a buck to ride.  Next time we will probably just come for ice cream, skip the actual meals here.
(the greatest coffee shop MOKA is next door fyi, other sleepy parents)"}
{"text":"My wife grew up in Madison and spent her childhood going to Ella's Deli. Unfortunately times have not been kind to Ella's Deli. I first went 12 years ago with her family on my first visit to Madison and the food was good and the prices reasonable. A bowl of Matzo ball soup had two Matzo balls and came in an actual bowl. We have gone to Ella's on every trip that we make to Madison but have noticed that over the years it has become a disappointing experience. The food has become mediocre yet the prices have risen, which is quite an odd phenomenon. Usually prices increase with quality but Ella's has managed to rewrite the rules. A bowl of Matzo ball soup is now one ball in a cup, yet more expensive. A $9 Reuben does not even include fries and somehow a scoop of ice cream is a whopping $3.65. This was our last visit to this once good and reasonable but now expensive and less satisfactory restaurant. This ends 12 years of my visiting and a lifetime for my wife."}
{"text":"Terrible. Food and service were awful. Avoid at all costs. Overpriced, we waited for an hour to get our food, and when we did the bagel was hard, pastrami dry. Just...stay away"}
{"text":"The food is 3 star, the decor is 5. This is an amazing place to take children for ice cream! The menu is all bland and way over priced for what it is. But the tables are fun, the ceiling is a sensory overload, and the carousel is amazingly fun for cheap. I will always love this place!"}
{"text":"Fun and delicious in the summer; Cold and miserable in the winter.  

I had had the Mediterranean burger (a nice number with feta cheese and some lovely oil-based dressing for dipping or drizzling) back in the summer and have had dreams about it where I have awoken with a drool-drenched pillow ever since.  I'm sure you can imagine I was quite excited to be reunited with this special burger (a fresh one...not the one I'd already eaten on Memorial Day) when we 
went again in early January.

Well, it was not to be so.  The burger was fine.  The dressing was fine.  The problem was the four to five crumbs of feta on the burger.  They charged us when we asked for more.

But by far the worst thing about our most recent visit was the fact that there was no way in Hell the thermostat was set anywhere above the low 60s.

I run cold naturally so at first thought it was just me, but I looked around and the two other parties in the place were wearing their coats while eating!  My boyfriend who runs hot also kept his coat on throughout lunch (something i have never seen him do.). 

We even switched tables from one by the window to one in the interior of the place hoping, at first, we were just by a drafty window.  We were wrong.

We ate our mediocre sandwiches fantasizing about the hot chocolates and lattes we were going to get from Moka next store after our arctic lunch was over.

It wasn't all bad, though.  My five-year old had some Chocolate Shop ice cream to top off the meal (he was too distracted by the displays to notice hypothermia was setting in) and waitstaff was pleasant and attentive.  

I am doling out only two stars because if you can't afford to keep your heat on during winter maybe you should shut down in winter just like your carousel."}
{"text":"Loved all the cool toys moving around and that we could play with the table.  However the two sandwiches took close to an hour to get and were just ok.  Also the table and menu both felt grimy. If you don't like kids I'd avoid this place.  It was packed full of screaming little kids."}
{"text":"10.99 for a baked potato!!!!!!

First I asked what soup has more vegetables, the matzo ball or chicken noodle. The waitress says they are the same. I get the soup and there are no vegetables besides a very minuscule amount of carrots. Waitress should have advised me of that. The big bowl of soup only had 1 matzo ball in it too so I needed to order more food. The waitress had taken away my menu so I just ordered a baked potato without knowing the price. I asked if I ordered cheddar cheese if it would be shredded cheddar or the melted nacho style cheese. She said that she thought it was shredded. I get it and it's the gross melted cheese. I'm on my lunch break so whatever I eat it and just try to take off most of the cheese. I get the bill and its $18!!!!! For chicken broth, 1 matzo ball, and a baked potato with gross cheese, broccoli, and chopped tomatoes. Not to mention the slow service.

Ugh never ever coming back. Save your money and time and go somewhere else like Crostini. 

Note for server: if you don't know, then ask the kitchen. Don't just guess. Also advise someone on the absurd price of the baked potato if they are ordering it without a menu in front of them. 

If I didn't have to rush back to work, I would have asked to speak to a manager."}
{"text":"This place is pretty overpriced. The decor is a bit creepy, but the kids were entertained; I just hope they don't have night terrors now. 

I got a small bowl of soup and just one soup of ice cream and the bill was ten bucks after tip. I suppose I've wasted money in worse ways, but I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I was so disgusted by the food at Ella's that I decided to finally create a yelp account. I've been here a few times because it's popular with the kids, and the service has always been fine. The surroundings are also impressive, but this is a restaurant and the food has to be eaten at some point.

The food served here is so bad as to feel insulting."}
{"text":"* * * This review is based on Ice Cream & Merry-Go-Round visits Only * * *

My daughter and I came here yesterday (after a long ordeal up the block from here) for waffle cones.  Black cherry for her, Mint Chip for me.  

I took my 11 year old 2nd cousin here for ice cream and a horsey-ride about a month ago.

The place is pretty cool eye candy for out of towners; I agree with Nina O. though they ought to shut the place down for a day, cover tables, counters, kitchen, etc. and take a huge can of compressed air and blow the years of dust off of everything in the place."}
{"text":"Bottom line? Great for kids. Hell on earth for those without. 

The prices weren't great - $6 for an ice cream sundae? - but the ice cream was good, and the options are many. They have a whole desserts-only menu, for Pete's sake. 

The serving dishes are just small enough that if the ice cream melts at all, there's an overflow - but that's just incentive to eat faster, right? 

I've never been when the place isn't packed, but with a real merry-go-round in use, it's not surprising."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a pint sized tot. It's your average run of the mill deli style menu but the atmosphere is amazing and makes for a wonderland of excitement for little kids. I'm still in awe of all the moving gadgets when I go in. The carousel is beautiful and needless to say I myself have ridden it countless times... I luv Ella's!"}
{"text":"Ok, I am totally charmed by this place. It's kitschy and loud and the food is awesome deep fried deliciousness. Love the old animatronic crap that is everywhere!

Best of all, however, are the absolutely AMAZING and gloriously perfect deep fried pickles. I've yet to find them done better ANYWHERE."}
{"text":"Why are you closing, Ella's?! Ella's is the most amazing place. Of all of the places I've been (and that's a LOT), Ella's was the most enchanting, fun, wonderous, and magical. I told everyone that told me they were going to Wisconsin to go there. There is nothing like it anywhere. Who cares if the soup wasn't great? THAT WASN'T THE POINT. First, you should have had the ice cream, second, the sandwiches were great. Most importantly, Ella's was a treasure and it was lucky for all of us to have seen it without paying admission."}
{"text":"Although the decor was intersting,and out of place! It seems like something that should be in Wisconsin Dells/ Baraboo! Right next to Paul Bunions another distasteful tourist trap ! We sat down in this loud dirty dinning establishment,and got a filthy binder full of like 100 food items ? I knew we stepped in to a quantity not quality restaurant ! The prices where really high $2.95 for a dill pickle fries $5 crazy. I see by the 100,000, million kilowatts they are burning per hour is why the high prices. We ordered a soda got bill and left ! We only waited 10 min up front to pay! Service is poor and pushy.What does a Circus cluttered distasteful decor have to do do with Jewish, Russian American cuisine anyway? If you like high prices, screaming kids, crowds? poor food quality and lots of quantity this place is for you! Bring $50 with for lunch it will cost a couple just that !"}
{"text":"I has the Reuben today. I was very disappointed.  For a 10.00 sandwich is was sad. It came with the smallest dish of cole slaw, the bread was terrible thin and dry. Toast not grilled. The sandwich was so thin. There was 3 slices of meat. My friends was the same.  For a deli Reuben this was terrible.  The sandwich was no more than 2 inches thick, soggy and mostly sauerkraut. The sauerkraut juice literally ran out of it.
The kids meal came with a small cup of applesauce.  There was about 1/2 teaspoon of applesauce in it. It was so small you could not get a spoon in it. It was smaller than A 30 cc medicine cup. For shame.
Won't go back

."}
{"text":"Perfect place if you have kids.  Lots of visual stimulation...plus ice cream.  Food wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"There's absolutely no other restaurant like this, ever.  You wouldn't know what I mean unless you've been there.  The atmosphere is almost that of a bad dream or what I'd imagine a bad trip on drugs would be.  Clowns, circus people, etc hanging from the walls that move across the ceiling.  Feet with faces on them, strange decor all around.  Even the tables have a little  display underneath a seethrow plastic setting.  I bet back in the 80's this place was fun and great for kids, but now it's just rather creepy.  The menu is like 50 pages of word art, confusing and strange.  They have odd things on the menu like Lox and they don't have bacon or sausage or any pork products - I believe it's a Jewish owner.  Either way, this place is incredibly creepy but none-the-less the food was good and so was the service."}
{"text":"This is a sad place. It has a carousel, it has all sorts of cute kitsch scattered about, above, around, and beyond. It's got cartoon characters, horsies, and things that look like it came out of a child's dream... 

Unfortunately, this place is more of an adults nightmare. In fact, it's really only good for those who know no better, or don't care to get ripped off. The prices are unconscionably high for the mediocre quality and the skimpy servings (sides are extra, unless you settle for watered down cole slaw). There's a place in Chicago called Perry's, whose sandwiches are probably 4 times the size of those at Ella's, 10 times the quality, enough for two to share - maybe more... but at the same price. How is that possible? 

Ella's is also dirty. Dirty seats, dirty tables, dirty silverware, dirty plates, dirty cups... If you are going to slip that much money out my pocket, keep the damn place clean. The servers are kinda not so clean either. My son and I waited almost 10 minutes to be served after being seated. We only got attention after I flagged down a server from another section who passed by and made a conscientious effort to avoid eye contact. Really? I would have left, but my son would have been sad. Instead, I let him enjoy and decided to be the sad one.

It's possible only because they surround themselves with a carousel, kitsch about, above, around, and beyond. The kids want to go there... they don't care about an overpriced sorry sandwich. They are too young and too distracted - and can you blame them? I don't. I blame the owners of Ella's for using all the distractions... because if your kids didn't want to go there, you probably wouldn't even bother either ."}
{"text":"If you find that you simply MUST go here despite knowing in advance that the food is at best edible, at worst horrid and overpriced, and that the crap hanging from the ceilings is never cleaned although it zips mightily across the ceiling hovering over your plates, then there's nothing I can tell you to change your mind, is there??

The pound cake sundae is literally the only saving grace for this decrepit place.  You have been warned."}
{"text":"Watched with longing eyes as others were getting placemats and full sets of silverware as I'm sitting here with just a fork, warm lemonade, and soggy microwaved cheese fries. Not a happy camper."}
{"text":"I am a little torn on how to rate this place like other reviews. This place is a must see for kids at least once. The place is unique with all of the crazy decorations and toys hanging around. From our kid's point of view,  it is definitely 5 stars. For my wife and I, a would only say 3 stars.  They have a very large selection on their menu and the ice cream/shakes are delicious. It is a little over priced, but I think it's is because of the experience. The food is nothing special or out of the ordinary. I remember going to this place when I was in high school and loved it, but now that I'm older, I'm like,  \"Eh... its ok\"."}
{"text":"I went back to Ella's and they impressed me enough to edit my review and give them another star.  I still feel the majority of the food is overpriced, especially considering what you get for it, but it tasted good and was fresh.  Kosher isn't important to me but for those of you who it is this place will fill your need.  The ice cream was still very tasty as was their homemade chocolate lava cake which was delicious.  It's still a little too kitschy for my personal taste so I don't see myself frequented the place but the occasional meal might be fun.  One thing that kept me from moving them up to four stars was the service.  They seem to staff a lot of kids still in school for whom it seems like this might be their first service job, our server didn't have an attitude problem or anything like that he was just very forgetful.
Oh and they ran out of tuna.  WTF!"}
{"text":"Open faced roast beef on rye with mashed potatoes was stellar! Try the Big Red; It's a drink that comes with a large hunk of cotton candy on top. Kids who spend their birthday here get a balloon, free sundae, candy, and a free ride on the carousel. This place will keep your kids busy looking and pointing for hours! They will absolutely love it. They have a kosher deli, ice cream parlor, sit down restaurant area, candy shop,  and an outdoor carousel. So great! We've gone with groups of kids and worth adults! Everyone always has fun."}
{"text":"I could tell that this place was different, just pulling up to the parking lot. I've attached a photo and a link to their web site... but this is one of those cases where you just have to experience it to understand it. The web site doesn't even come CLOSE to conveying the experience that this small, family-oriented establishment is. And the best part of all... it was PACKED! And it was LOUD! (so be forewarned: this is for kids and those young at heart. it's not for those trying to be cool or hip.)

The menu is adorable, homey, features local menu items, and is reminiscent of a diner menu. But the really amazing part about this unique eatery are the gadgets, toys, and displays covering every square inch of the interior... and a working carousel outside to boot. There are a number of flying figures inside, including Bart Simpson, Batman, and Harry Potter. There is something interesting and unique inside every table. We sat at an electric toy-train table where the train actually moved. We also saw Monopoly embedded in another table, a display of PEZ dispensers in another, and a giant castle scene in another. Basically, this place is a child's toy fantasy come true.

A place where the families of Madison can have a good meal at a good price, and their kids can enjoy the near-chaos of every imaginable toy, gadget and doodad constantly in motion. A sensory overload experience!

I'm giving it four stars instead of five because it did seem like it could use an overall sprucing up. (My visit here was July 2006.)"}
{"text":"I want Ella's to be better. But the food is only okay and the service is slow. The food is overpriced and not that special (except the fried pickles -- those were great).

I do question the judgment of people who think that Ella's is going to be a quiet place for dinner, though. Seriously? Could you not tell from the carousel outside that it's not good for meetings? 

By all means, bring kids here. It's a great place for them to look around and be entertained. And my husband loves the grilled pound cake. But it seems cramped, dirty and in dire need of an overhaul. I'd love to see them close down over the winter and completely update the inside and the menu."}
{"text":"If I were 4 years old this place would be awesome.  However I am a mom with two small children.   The atmosphere was relaxed which was what we were looking for.  The moving toys everywhere were fun to look at at first but then were just annoying and squeaky.  My 2 year old freak at one of the toys on a swing and my husband had to hold her the whole time.  
The deli is FILTHY.  Everything from the table to the chairs to the highchairs.  Disgusting.  I wanted to scrub my kids down when we left.  Just moving my chair I grabbed onto God knows what on the back of my seat.   Gross. 
The food was just as bad.  We both ordered burgers.  They were so overcooked they tasted burnt and they was no juice left in them.   They came out dry.  No toppings whatsoever.  Our waitress was just as bad.  She would drop things at our table and turn to run before we could even ask for anything else.  I watched one of the hostesses pick up a booster chair and examine it and brush dirt off of it before taking it to a table.  

We skipped dessert being anxious to leave and let our daughter ride the carousel (once again, filthy).  We will not return here nor recommend it.  We can't believe The Travel Channel even stopped in here.  Terrible."}
{"text":"I would rate this lower, but for what the food lacks, the atmosphere makes up. The food is best described as cafeteria. But the decor is insane! Be prepared to wait for a table. Kids and grown ups alike will enjoy all there is to see here. Loads of gadgets, robots, and such to look at. Worth a stoping in at least once. In the warmer months, you can take a ride on the carousel out front."}
{"text":"Super fun place for kids if you are anywhere near the Madison area. The decor alone replaced any need for bringing out electronic devices. The food is fine.. What you would expect to find in most of Wisconsin. I had he matzo bowl soup which I liked. My husband ordered some sort of veggie burger sandwich which was really awful. Kids were delighted with their cheeseburgers and fries. Awesome selection of delicious ice creams. End your meal with a carousal ride!"}
{"text":"You know the scene in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas where he has a terrible trip at Circus Circus? Yeah. This is worse. I always thought it looked like a wonderland driving by but when my fiance and I finally stopped in.. We realized we made a terrible mistake. That place is the stuff of nightmares. I had a nightmare that night. What may be whimsical for kids and weird adults is what horror movies are made of. We stayed and figured maybe the food is at least good. Not the case. I got the blintz and couldn't eat more than one of them. They came with what tastes like cherry pie filling and the middle was filled with what I'll assume is cottage cheese which made me gag. Coffee is worse than usual diner coffee.. For the prices they charge you would assume the food would be better or would come with sides. Come once and order ice cream or anything they don't actually make and that one time will be more than enough. To restock your nightmare fuel."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really cool but the food is the problem. I got their classic corn beef sandwich. It was a $10 sandwich and it didn't come with fries. When it came out it was a puny little sandwich. Like something I would make at home. It just wasn't good. I really wanted to like it but I just couldnt."}
{"text":"The restaurant was dirty.  The wait staff served us a glass with mustard smeared on it.  Staff seemed annoyed to be there.  The food was OK.  a burger with cold rubbery cheese on a great bun.  A order of tasteless fries with a few still frozen.  Yes frozen and cold. A sunder that was $7.00 was not as good as it used to be with under grilled pound cake and a regular hot fudge sundae. I also noted that the sundea was listed 2x on the menu with slightly different names.  When I asked the server what was different about the 2 sundaes she told me nothing it's the same thing.  Not a fan of this.  The carousel is in need of repair and paint job.  This is a signature piece of the restaurant and is looking poor.  Overall, over priced, misleading and not well kept restaurant"}
{"text":"Pricey!!!  Worst value in Madison.  Top end prices for small meals made from mediocre ingredients.  $14 for a reuben that was tiny and about 20 crinkle fries. $6+ for a kids meal with no drink or dessert.  Party of 7, at best one person claimed there food good.  

Gets 2 stars as the service was decent & atmosphere is unique.  

Money trap, try to avoid!"}
{"text":"An ice cream parlour with a carousel?!!?  The ice cream is great in that old timey, not mashed with all the toppings sorta way.  The ice cream is great, but how do you fudge up ice cream?  The real treat is the setting which is so much fun.  Obviously it's ideal for children which for a person without kids means you have to deal with a least one child screaming for ice cream all the time.  I've never tried the deli menu, but I'd like to!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Terrible food and worse. service. Overpriced and under-managed. Don't waste your time. I had high hopes which made the disappointment even harder to stomach. I will NEVER return."}
{"text":"This resturant is good for one thing: birth control. 

The food is gross and WAY overpriced. 

If you love screaming infants and paying ten dollars for a hot dog, this might just be your place."}
{"text":"Best place ever!!! I am so coming back again! Food us delicious, service is good, and there is a carousel! Amazing decorations too!"}
{"text":"If you are going for viewing pleasure or dessert, PERFECT!  If you are going for an actual meal...don't.  The kids love this place, but they are also eating grilled cheese or chicken strips, hard to screw up.  The \"adult\" food is bland at best.  
Fun tables, fun views, and the merry-go-round is a plus, but just go for snacks."}
{"text":"Ella's is easily the Happiest Place On Earth!

I passed through Madison on my way up north and just had to stop here. This place was filled with the majest of a 1980's childhood, a real-life Pee Wee's Playhouse. 

The outside boasts in bright colors, a blue and white Vaudevillian awning and a large, working carousel out front. Inside, it's even better. The ceilings are lined with dozens of homemade paper-mâché figures that move. Yes, they are animatronic!  Characters range from the Beatles to Bart Simpson. All of the tables are display cases with clear tops containing everything from a Pez collection to a Wooly Willy Magnetic Face that you can play with while you wait for food.

After you're done gawking, you'll remember that you were here to eat...

Ella's menu is a whopping TWENTY pages with every kind of sandwich, side, and sausage imaginable. A separate SIX page menu is available for desserts, ice cream and milkshakes. They also have an entire two pages of vegetarian options, including soup.

I ordered:

- Kugel ( egg noodles, farmers' cheese, sour cream and cinnamon; served with a side of strawberries and sour cream)
- Reuben sandwich
- potato salad (the world's best!)
- cole slaw
- chocolate phosphate soda
- Turtle pound cake sundae (a big pile of fudgey, carmel, gooey yum!)

Ella's served up some of the most delicious food that has ever impressed my palate! It was so good that on my return trip, I went an hour out of the way to eat lunch here again. 

The food is a bit pricey, about $25 for appetizer, sandwich, and dessert. The portions are generous; but don't expect to get an overflowing platter. Ella's is good with following serving sizes. Restaurant was clean, servers were attentive and friendly.

Ella's satisfied not only my tastes but my imagination. This is a wonderful place for adults to reminisce and enjoy a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"As many reviewers have noted the food at Ella's is both substandard and expensive. It seems to be getting worse; the corned beef and pastrami are dry and tasteless, and tonight my dining companion's omelette and my kugel were both brought to the table cold. The server was friendly but forgot my fork, there was no salt or pepper on the table, and she thought that lox was \"raw salmon.\" This once upon a time was a decent deli by midwestern standards, but the only reason to go there now is with some little kids to enjoy the ice cream, the carousel, and the manic cartoon atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food is good/ok as well as the service.  The four stars are because it is a great place to bring a kid.  The atmosphere and decorations are terrific for a young one."}
{"text":"\"If my thumbs could grow there'd be two holes in the ceiling right now\" - my son

Cool atmosphere with the bonus that what's sensory overload for adults is just enough to keep the kids occupied. Food's not bad either."}
{"text":"Astounding. It's like the circus over lunch. A million moving things for the kids to see including real rideable carousel. And perfectly good deli food, including plenty of vegetarian options. Feels world-historic."}
{"text":"Also don't want to go here if you have epilepsy, because the chaotic hodgepodge of dolls, toys, signs and flashing lights might induce a seizure.  However, even in its craziness, for a west coast jewish boy, this place was a savior for supplying me with some of the only New York deli-style sandwiches and salads in Wisconsin.  They also have great burgers.  Definitely gets 5 stars for the effort at creating a one-of-a-kind experience blending Wisconsin and Jewish cultures with an acid-trip circus, all rolled into one motif."}
{"text":"My last and final trip: Counted 3 house centipedes crawl across the floor, food was stale (all the breads and buns), and the service was super slow. Not to sound harsh but I am surprised this place passes any sort of food and bug inspection each year. I don't know if there is some leeway with inspections because it's an age old Madison delicacy or what, but this resturaunt needs to be closed down. I'm sure they had a good run but please, don't take your children or family here. There are much healthier and more sanitary resturaunts to dine at. AVOID."}
{"text":"Literally the scariest place I have ever been.
I have no idea how people think this place is suitable for children because I'm an adult and I was uncomfortable.
Aside from the creepy atmosphere, I didn't find the food too appealing either. I got a grilled chicken with tomato + lettuce on whole wheat. The chicken was a little cold and the bread was toasted despite the fact that I asked them not to do so. Service was meh. Nothing out of the ordinary but not terrible either. In any case, I really don't understand how this place as survived as long as it has."}
{"text":"I can't rate the food since I never ate. My friend wanted to show me this place since she used to live in Madison and thought I might like to bring my kids to this fun themed deli/ice cream restaurant. We arrived around noonish for lunch on Friday Feb. 10th.  We had 3 in our party. The hostess on duty quickly sat us at a table.  My friend very kindly asked of we could please sit at a booth.  The hostess told her no and said there were no booths in our area.  My friend said, \"Perhaps we could be seated in a booth over in that area\" and the hostess looked up and said \"No\" in a very annoyed sounding tone.  My friend wears hearing aids and asked for her to repeat her answer.  The hostess looked up and said again, very annoyed, a firm \"No\" and walked away.  We were both kind of shocked.  We walked to the bathroom...there were indeed several open booths that were clean and set ready for guests  in the other area and other groups were seated in that area so it was not an area with no wait staff available. Its NOON on a Friday...were they understaffed??   We were given no explanation or perhaps a \"Im very sorry, this is the only table I have, we had a waitress go home and are short staffed.\"  

It was so uncomfortable to be treated that way thst we decided to leave.  On the way out we told the hostess we were leaving and she just nodded and did not smile or offer any apology or explanation.

I would like to add on a positive note, the waitress that brought water was not at all like the hostess. She was cheerful and kind."}
{"text":"Worst pastrami sandwich I have ever had. Paid $10 for dry meat, cheap bread and a pickle ( which was pretty good.)"}
{"text":"Love IT! For a person who doesn't have / doesn't like kids, I go here pretty often. I love the old school ambiance and just the sheer volume of STUFF to look at while dining. The menu is super extensive - I dare you to go and not be able to find anything on the menu to eat.

Con: if you don't like kids, it can be kind of a pain to go while there's a birthday party in progress. But then, you did go to a restaurant with a carousel out front.  :) Have fun!"}
{"text":"Ah, I wasn't sure where in the entire state of Wisconsin I could find Matzo ball soup. The answer is here, my friends! The broth is flavorful and the noodles a nice complement. At first I was leery of this place being gimmicky looking, but the turkey and melted cheddar baked potato changed my mind. My eyes were able to wander off and look at all of the moving mobiles on the ceiling and toys galore. In Manhattan terms, think of it as a mix of FAO Schwartz plus Serendipity plus a dash of Times Square showiness thrown in. 

I had to do a double take at our scratched table because at first I thought it was dirty. No, wait! On the inside, it was actually ground up magnets that you could use a pen with attraction to draw. 

I would return for the good food, but be extra prepared with my cheesy tolerance up. Take your friends that can handle the carnival-esque atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"It's crazy in a great way!!!  The kids loved it for two hours.  Everywhere they looked they saw something new and interesting to say the least."}
{"text":"If only I had checked the reviews here before wasting 19.00 dollars a 2 pops, a corned beef sandwich and fries. Terrible service, small portions and over priced food. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Good deserts, huge menu (people liked the food too, but I didn't have any). Lots of kitsch on the ceiling, very interesting and unique. Plus a carousel!"}
{"text":"Horsey Carousel or mountain high ice cream?  Depending on the day, you can enjoy both!
This place is packed with knick knacks, circus figurines, moving sculptures, toys, you name it all over the walls and ceiling.  If you have ADHD you might want to put on some sunglasses.
There's a carousel outside that you can buy tickets for in the summer, but to be honest there is enough going on inside.  Food is good.  Basic. Hot dogs, burgers, noodles, mac and cheese, salads, etc. 
Ice cream sundaes, cones, and other deserts are delish and just how you remember from your childhood.
Your kids will be wound up on sugar, over stimulation visually and will want a treat at the candy counter on the way out.  Hopefully they'll pass out on the way home and you get some quiet moments in the car.
It's fun.  It's crazy. But those are some good memories."}
{"text":"I just visited Ella's a couple weeks ago after not being in for a few years (as I now live abroad). It definitely has cleaned up its act since I was last in.

The food has always been ok and overpriced, but on this occasion we just got ice cream. GIANT scoops. Yum! (They used to do their own, but these days serve Chocolate Shoppe premium ice cream which is delicious and very high quality). 

The decor is the reason anyone comes back. And it needs a little love, but wasn't as dusty as the last time I visited. 

Ella's - you seemed shinier in the 80s. I hope you will return to your glory. But I still love you all the same."}
{"text":"Holy kitsch!

My fiancée and I went in here recently to see if it lived up to the standards we'd set for the place when we were little kids. The place had begun to fade from my memory so aside from a cacophony of mechanical whirring and children playing I didn't know exactly what to expect.

The décor is just as tacky as I remember. Trains chugging along the walls, flying Bart Simpsons and Yellow Submarines, the creepy little girl on a swing rocking back and forth. The place gets to be a bit of sensory overload, but that's sorta what it's known for. 

The server who took our order was very nice. i have no complaints about the service.

I have both good and bad to say about the food:
+The reuben I got was well built. It didnt get soggy until the very end when it was mostly just kraut and dressing left.
+The flavor of the reuben was great. I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had, but it can definitely hold its own. The kraut they use is particularly tasty
+I can't believe I'm mentioning this, but the soda. I got a cherry Pepsi, but it's not like cherry Pepsi that you're used to. They use crushed ice and a shot of grenadine to mix it. That in and of itself isn't unusual--you can get grenadine in cola at most any bar or supper club if you ask--but the proportions here are heavenly (and that word isn't an understatement). Usually places add way too much grenadine and it tastes like carbonated cough syrup. I've stopped drinking soda almost entirely except for going out to eat, so to make something relatively mundane like Pepsi taste fantastic is commendable.

-The fries were meh. Nothing stood out about them. They were just bland bits of potato.
-My fiancée got the mushroom and swiss burger, and her patty was burned. She took it apart to show me and it was, indeed, black as a hockey puck on the bottom.

Overall, I'd say that this place is worth stopping into if you have nostalgia about coming here as a kid or if you have children yourself. If you're a transplant to the Madison area and without kids, I'd suggest passing on this place for now. It's not that the food is bad, it's just about average and you don't need to surround yourself with kids and toys to enjoy average food. This place is, ultimately, a novelty and they're very good at being a novelty, but they're not the kind of place I imagine anyone being a regular at."}
{"text":"Now please take my review with a grain of salt, because I never actually had the opportunity to try any of the food at Ella's. I made it inside and had a chance to look around at the wondrous variety of colorful toys and games that would have brought out the kid in me. However, I then looked around and saw dozens of greasy screaming children that made me wretch at the idea that I ever used to be like that. 

The rest of the crowd here didn't do much for the atmosphere as well - morbidly obese hillbillies, old people hooked up to oxygen tanks, waiters with pit stains and spilled food on their clothing...together they created some kind of overwhelming stench that slowly turned my desire to put food into my stomach into an uncontrollable instinct to send it flying straight out.

Once we were seated at a table covered in a thin, sticky veneer that grabbed on to everything it touched, we had had enough. As soon as the waiter left to get our water, we had to sneak out of there. Any longer and I was afraid this place was going to devolve into a scene from a Stephen King movie."}
{"text":"I am torn! My grandma tells me she took me here when I was little. My brother and sisters talk about it as if it's a major part of our childhood. I don't actually have any memories. The ambience/decor is pretty cool with so much to look at and talk about. That's the best part. The ice cream was pretty good...but terribly overpriced! And the hostess who met us at the door had her boobs half hanging out! NOT cool for a children's ice cream shop!
We bought carousel tickets, the ride was long and the kids enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"I LOVE THEIR HUMMUS.  I would pay lots of money for the recipe. Or buy it in a large tub.  In fact, next time I visit, I just might ask about that latter option... anyway, every time I have ever come I have gotten the hummus platter and I always walk away feeling like I got a great healthy meal.  For a veggie and chickpea plate, it seems a wee bit pricy (I think $8 - I am cheap though), but it's oh so yummy."}
{"text":"All I am going to do here is inform you, if you are in Madison, Wisconsin, you hafta check out Ella's Diner!!!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place and came back for the first time in years. Main issue, my sandwich was SMALL. I got a Reuben and it was on small oval bread cut diagonally...the halves were like slightly large hors d'oeuvres. Seriously, regular grocery store bread would have made a substantially bigger sandwich. It was like three bites for each half, ate it in two minutes and it cost $9.50. They did load the rest of the plate with average fries (cost extra). My memory of Ella's from a decade ago is of getting huge sandwiches you couldn't even finish. Yeah, all the toys are cute and fun but the food is a rip off. Service took a long time, didn't check on refilling drinks, etc. Sad to say I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"If you haven't gone to Ella's Deli, treat yourself right and go now! The inside is decorated with endless decor that will remind EVERYONE of their childhoods, which is just the tip of the iceberg. They have a kosher menu with an ice cream shop inside too, and the service is simply unbeatable. Plus, this restaurant is located right on East Wash and is easy to find. :-)"}
{"text":"Fun place to eat.  Have becoming here for roughly 25 years.  THe kids loved it when they  were younger, now when travelling in the Madison area, we always try and get there at least once a year."}
{"text":"Cute place. Memorial Day. Our destination restaurant was closed so we back tracked and stopped here. Kids loved it from the beginning. Quirky. Memorable. I had the chicken salad sandwich on rye. The sandwich tasted like one your grandmother would make in her kitchen when you were 7. Nothing wrong with that.   I'm happy our plans changed and we could experience this place. It wasn't fantastic. But for lunch, it was simple and who can be upset about crinkle cut fries."}
{"text":"This is a great way to have a nice lunch/dinner with kids. On the outside is a 1927 carousel in full working condition and beautiful as ever.  You can ride it during the late May to early September timeline (sometimes earlier sometimes later- depends on weather).  Once on you walk into the place, there's tons of things for children to look at. Even some of the tables are interactive. There's even a Rube Goldberg contraption they've put into the ceiling near the deli counter.  I have been here several times and even took friends from out of town here.  The place is a good place for people who have different tastes. We had folks wanting the matzo ball soup, others wanting sandwiches and then others, just something little to snack on. They even have a diverse children's menu.  On top of all of these, they have Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream (as well as their own custard) and many ice cream creations within their massive dessert menu.  The price wasn't overly expensive and the food is good. Nothing over the top for taste but definitely a must see when in Madison.  Such a unique place."}
{"text":"We only go here when we're so hungry and we have the kids with us (great place to distract your kids so you can eat!) Food is very poor and prices are outrageous crazy high! The service is horrible! Like I said we only go here if we're crazy hungry and have the kids with us!"}
{"text":"It's fine for grabbing an ice cream at the ice cream counter. Their ice cream is delicious. I wish the games at the tables would be repaired. And that the tables were less sticky. Customer service could be a little bit better, but I think sometimes they're understaffed. Of course the carousel is awesome."}
{"text":"This is literally the coolest place to have lunch! The decor and table games are so entertaining you have to go back several times to take it all in! The food is actually surprisingly delicious and the there's a large menu to choose from. Some of our family favorites are the potato salad, the cheese curds, the burgers and of course all of the ice cream! Just overall a fun dining experience for everyone!"}
{"text":"I ate here years back and I thought it was good, but sadly it's not any more. The decor is cool but the place seemed dirty and the menus were gross to touch. Campground bathrooms are nicer than this place. They had a large menu but nothing good, unless you loved Reuben's and liver and tongues. Food was way over priced. $9 for a tiny sand which and a tiny cup of coleslaw. Food was blah. I would not come back."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Ella's I think, \"This is it! This is the time I'm going to get some really great food!\" And every time I am wrong.  I am not going to go into detail about the food I've had. I'm a vegetarian, so my menu choices are much slimmer than my meat eating counterparts. However, I've yet to have a meal at Ella's that I would deem \"good.\"  The whole things seems to me kind of like getting a hot lunch meal from school. And let's face it - the food is EXPENSIVE.  Really expensive.  I paid nine dollars for three small blintzes with some sour cream and applesauce that looks like baby food - I get it...it's applesauce, but I guess I was expecting something better than the \"old standby.\" Every time we leave, I'm shocked at how much money we spent.

The good things about Ella's?  The atmosphere. The carousel. The ice cream, which is also insanely overpriced, but for some reason it's ice cream so I'm okay with it.  We had a server the last time who had a smile on her face the entire time and seemed to truly be enjoying her job.  It's a fabulous place to bring people just for the experience, but from now on \"the experience\" for me is just going to include a dish of ice cream and a ride on the merry-go-round."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 stars for the atmosphere and the carousel. I could spend all day in there looking at stuff. I hear the ice cream is really really good but was too full to get any. The fried pickles were very good but....our meals were just...mediocre at best.  I ordered the Chicago dog and the bun was toasted. Toasted?  It should've been steamed.  My dad had the patty melt and said it was just ok.  Very small portions for the price. With this being said though, I would go back. My 2 year old had a ball there and I would to look around some more."}
{"text":"If Willy Wonka had a deli and ice cream parlor, THIS is what it would look like.

You can tell this is a definite tourist stop for kids and those young at heart. It is a true novelty of a place. It's fun and there are animations in every corner of the store.

Its fun that every table has its own theme and entertainment. It's fun that they have a carousel outside and many flavors of ice cream inside. The menu is largely filled with basic items, but nothing stands out as great per say.

Did I enjoy the time here? Yes. Would it be a regular stop? Not really.. but its a great touristy and kid location though.

The staff was generous and genuinely happy to help so I see that as a good reason, if any, to make a come back when I am back in Madison."}
{"text":"This is a good place to take your kid(s) because of all the gizmos and gadgets they have hanging around the restaurant. They keep the kids occupied for a good amount of time.

Service was only okay. Our waitress was friendly and helpful when needed. The downside was that they're so busy when we were there that we only had our water refilled once and it was done when we were almost finished eating. We were only given the kids cups too. I would think that since we have such small cups of water, that they would check often to see if we needed refills but that didn't happen.

The food was not good enough. I wouldn't even say it is okay. I got a burger which came with fries, a pickle and some coleslaw. The pickle and coleslaw was good but I have had better fries and burgers. My burger tasted dry and the fries were plain. My oldest son, who loves fries, tried one and didn't touch them again. He did enjoy the chicken tenders though. The price of the food is okay. I have had better food for the same price at other places.

I have to agree with some people about the cleanliness of this place. While we were waiting for our food, a worker cleaned up one of the booths next to us. He brushed all the leftover crumbs and french fries on to the ground. I thought he would be back to sweep it up but he never returned. The mess was still on the ground when we left an hour later."}
{"text":"You know what?  The food here isn't anything to write home about.

You know what else?   This has never been a destination I would go to for the food anyway.  In fact, if you are coming here just to eat you are missing the point entirely.

What you should be coming here for is the atmosphere, the carousel and the ice cream.  You should be coming here to make memories with your kids (or the kids in your life--nieces for me) and have some ice cream.  I remember this place from my childhood and I defy you to find a child that is not mesmerized with the amount of stuff hanging from the ceiling or tucked inside the many shodowbox-like tables (Ours had a medieval LEGO scene inside it).  

My burger was decent, but I can assure you it wasn't the reason I set foot through the door."}
{"text":"The reason for 2 stars was the atmosphere and the waitstaff and the nice woman hostess. 
We got there around 4 on Thursday. 2 other people in the restaurant. Not busy was a clue. 
I got the Rueben with potatoe salad and a tiny cup of coleslaw. You can get a much better Reuben from Arby's and much cheaper. Same with my friend and grandson. Hamburger and frys mediocre and over priced. Pbj ok frys dry and some overdone. 
We got icecream cones to go and there was crystals in the ice cream   Not good. 
The bathrooms need to be cleaned and remodeled. 
I probably won't be back. Quality down, prices too high. Ella would be sad."}
{"text":"This was fun! A friend we were visiting wanted to take her kids here before they sold, so we met up there. We loved it, especially the Harry Potter chasing the golden snich! The kids loved the carousel. Food was alright. ..kind of pricey and nothing great. But a fun place!"}
{"text":"First off, don't go here. Maybe walk in, go 'ahh' then walk out immediately. Don't worry, no one will bother you. There is no hostess waiting to seat you so you'll have plenty of time to sit by the door and look around. Then walk out. Leave. 

A deli? No. Worst meat and bread I've ever had. The menu is confusing, large with no instructions. I order a tukery sandwhich, with mayo. I asked for a hot sandwich. I got a moist bread, with turkey that was microwaved to a Luke warm tempature. 

We couldn't even finish our plate. Figured, why bother. 

The waitress station consists of a pen and a calculator. Nope, there is no system for them to type in your food, check the price. The cooks get the carbon copy of your order, if that. Your bill a
Is the what the calculator typed up and printed. 

Sorry. I'm currently waiting for my bill, so I'm rambling, bored, watching all the servers either sit and talk or get yelled at by other customers who want to leave, or just run around confused.  

Please, don't go here. It's horrible. And probably full of lots of fun germs you can play with at the table. 

New rule, you should only have to pay for what you eat. I would then owe $5 rather than $27."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the food there... but I certainly love the black-cherry ice cream they serve! :)"}
{"text":"Even though they are closing their doors next week, I still want to write a review because this is my childhood, and a part of me isn't accepting that they will be gone soon. Ella's is like a kid's dream. It's like House on the Rock in restaurant form. I stopped by yesterday to take my 13 month old for the first and last time. He was in awe of all the flying and moving tchotchkes. I was planning on just letting him chew on some of my fries, but saw they had a \"baby plate\" consisting of peas and carrot bits, vanilla yogurt, apple sauce, mandarin oranges, turkey, and cheese. It was the perfect meal for my little guy! I ordered the matzo ball noodle soup, and it was as good as I remember it. In addition to the soup I had the Wisconsin Cheeseburger, which was an insanely delicious overload of cheesy goodness. My husband had the barbecue burger, and he devoured it in 5 minutes. Accompanied by some crispy crinkle cut fries, it was obvious how impressed he was by how much he licked his fingers. Of course no trip to Ella's Deli is complete without some ice cream, so I had a good old fashioned vanilla shake and my husband, who can definitely stand to gain some weight since defeating cancer, had TWO butter pecan shakes! The waitress did say that this was the time to do it, after all. Waiting in a line outside for almost an hour was 100% worth it! We'll miss you, Ella's!"}
{"text":"You don't go to Ella's for the quality of the food, despite the vastness of their menu.

You go to Ella's for the atmosphere - it is every ADD kid's dream! There is so much to look at and interact with, lots of animitronics, and rarely changes in appearance, so you can always look forward to the comfort of seeing all of your old favorites. 

I particularly love that many of the tables are interactive, with glass tops encasing fun games to play with your family and friends.

Plus, they have a big ass carousel, and fun candy and toys for purchase.

Hands down, the best thing to eat at Ella's is their famous #1 - fried poundcake with vanilla ice cream and hot fudge on top - it is to die for.

Another special item for large groups: their sparkling kazoo (formerly the kitchen sink) - which is 32 scoops of various kinds of ice cream and sherbet in a big metal bowl, covered with every topping imaginable and a huge spoon to dish it out with. - great for parties!"}
{"text":"This is a four star review for nostalgia.  I have been coming here since I was a little kid on my way to grandmother's house we go.  If you are taking a youngster (I would say anyone under six) and you walk in looking through their eyes it is pure whimsey.  If you are an adult that can't handle being around a rowdy room of kids' ruckus, not the place for you.  The food is that of a Jewish deli and good.  Recommend the turkey reuben,  Kosher Chicago hot dog and Matzo ball soup.  They love giving free ice cream samples, which is exceptional.  There is so, so much to look at.  Definitely a novelty spot.  If you see a wait all the wait outside the door just keep on driving.  It's pricey but you kind of get a show along with your meal."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill.  The prices are absurd, the food is horrible, and some of the decorations that haven't been updated for 30+ years actually scared my kids!!  Last time we went the waitress was more concerned with the table next to us and we actually didn't end up tipping her (we never don't tip, we always tip at least 20%)  That shows how bad the service was!  We won't be going there ever again."}
{"text":"Yup. Insanely expensive. Service is rude and the food is just... not good. For the sad, sad sandwich I got and a bowl of soup? I should have gone to a restaurant downtown. Gross."}
{"text":"Grew up in Madison.  This is a must to visit, and definitely a place to take children: it is fun seeing their fascination with all that this place has to offer.  They also have a merry-go-round that operates in the Summer.  The food's good too: root beer and reuben is hard to beat, let alone the ice cream shop they've got for dessert.

I give this place 5 stars because you don't just go for the food, what Ella's offers is an experience, that that unique experience they do whole hog :)"}
{"text":"Decent deli food. Huge menu. Awesome decor FOR KIDS.
Ella's is really a kids place. By now you know they have toys everywhere, that its noisy and it has a carousel. But this place is so much better than any other KIDS PLACE around. I won't name names. It is going to a bit expensive as you will end up buying a toy , a carousel ride, ice cream and lunch for everyone in the group. But at least its not gambling for kids!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim for the first time tonight. Looks a bit suspect, but the food, ambiance, and our server, Sara, was top-notch!! We had such a fun time. We weren't sure what to order, as the menu is about 20 pages long(!), but Sara made excellent suggestions and it's great for kids. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Cool place for kids lunch. A little pricey and the Ruebens were not what they used to be."}
{"text":"My friends and I stumbled on this lovely place during winter break. If you are a person who has nightmares about moving dolls, this isn't really a nice atmosphere for you. They however do have famous characters on display such as spongebob and Harry potter.

They get most of their flavors from chocolate shoppe ice cream and the rest from other ice cream manufacturers. The food portions are small but the dessert portions are more than enough. Dessert in my opinion can't go wrong but I don't recall anything memorable about the I cream other than the banana split for two."}
{"text":"I am not sure how to rate our experience at Ella's Deli. If I were my five year old, Ella's would get a five star review for sure. But, since I am not five...I need to point out a few things with a more distinguishing eye. 

First things first, my daughter had a great time. She loved the atmosphere, the ice cream and the carousal. We will be back for ice cream and a carousal ride. However I will not eat there again for a variety of reasons: 

-the food is overpriced 
-it wasn't that good 
-the service was not good, the initial host we talked to to get a table for our party of seven was rude, it took a long time to get seated. Another host eventually took care of us, but the initial contact left a bad taste 
-the restaurant was dusty
-the atmosphere was overstimulating 
-the cleaning stations in the middle of the restaurant have got to break some sort of health code
-the baby  changing table is OUTSIDE of the restrooms, so, when a child is being changed you can smell them 
-the menu was large and confusing 

I have a soft spot for places like this. I wish them the best. I hope they are able to renovate and stay Madison's first and best deli!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was quite charming, with multitudes of animatronics and other interesting decor. Waiting for the meal was not at all boring with so much to look at! 
Unfortunately, the food left a little something to be desired. I originally ordered a 'shaved coffee cream' but was told that they were out of shaved coffee. I settled for a frosty mug of root beer, which was charged at the same price as the coffee drink I originally ordered. My dining companion was offered a 'refill' of his cherry Pepsi, but was charged twice for the beverage.
My dining companion also ordered mashed potatoes with his sandwich. Fries were brought and when this was pointed out, a side of mashed potatoes was brought. It looks as though we were also charged for the mashed potatoes.
My pastrami and corned beef Reuben was quite tasty, as was the Cole slaw. I would recommend this sandwich."}
{"text":"Went back for some nostalgia when I brought my family to Madison.  Unfortunately, Ella's has gone downhill fast.  The place is desperate for a relocation and new professional staff.  The guy working the carousel was intimidating people for tips.  Meanwhile, many unruly customers everywhere smoking ciggies and using profanity while kids are trying to enjoy the ride.  Relocate and return to a Madison staple.  This area is horrible."}
{"text":"They cover the walls with tacky crap with blinking lights and annoying little beeping sounds to distract you from the poor quality of the food. 

To call this a \"deli\" is an insult to all of the real delis out there."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic time at Ella's Deli. I always driven pass this place, and always wanted to come. 

I guess as adults, we have been used to 'generic' kind of dinning after a while. You are being served in a pleasant environment and happy to return. In Ella's Deli, it so unique I was just constantly stunned by all the toys moving around the side and the ceiling on their own. As well as how giant the Sparkled Kazoo. They are all really stimulating. And makes us be reminded, we could just be well stunned by a different kind of experience. And to top that up, the carousel ride was ace. 

Oh and their reuben sandwich and fries were quite tasty too. So they have some decent food too other than these stimulations. The waitresses were all very kind and nice to me. The service was very fast too. I have to say, I'm a little bit sad if Ella's Deli is sold and won't be here anymore. We are going to lose this one of a kind spot in Madison."}
{"text":"i really dont understand how anyone could give anything less than five stars

it has one of those things where a strobe light creates stop-motion
and flying superman's
and ball's rolling through tubes in apparent perpetual motion
and games INSIDE your table

and blintzes, kugel, dr. browns, and FRIED PICKLES

wtf. what is wrong with you people?! is there anything in life you like?!!?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Madison. Good coleslaw and I recommend the pump platter salads. Try to save room for some frozen custard.  You have to make it here if you have little kids just for the eclectic collection of toys and \"stuff\" that creates a great ambiance for kids."}
{"text":"I hate to say it---but this gets my vote for one of the least desirable places to eat in Madison. Their deli food is dry and sandwich portions are meager. Tables improperly cleaned and sticky, food is starchy and canned-tasting, and it's loud and dilapidated. I've been here a few times and besides the awesome merry-go-round in front and some very impressive homemade toys, my experience has repeatedly been very disappointing. Staff are nice though."}
{"text":"It's true, the tables are a little grody, and the service is not spectacular, but there are robotic toys EVERYWHERE. And the ice cream is delicious. And hello, it's JEWISH. They even sell little plush havdalah sets at the front!"}
{"text":"I was so delighted with finding this place. We drove in to Madison on our way to Chicago from Minneapolis/St. Paul, and we saw the carousel so we came back after going to downtown. Originally we were only going to grab some ice cream and let our son ride the carousel, but once we walked in and saw all of the fantasticness that was going on and I heard \"corned beef,\" we were staying for dinner.

I have corned beef with pickles and onions, and my husband had the holishkes. Our son had a hot dog and french fries. I though my sandwich was perfect, and the cole slaw was great (wish there had been more!) My husband's food was very good, too, with good portions of his veggies. The bread and muffin that came with his dinner were just incredible. My son liked his dinner as well, but the applesauce was ridiculously small...it was in an over-sized thimble basically.

After dinner we had ice cream. I had Kitty Kitty Bang Bang and Cake Batter Fudge. My son had Superman. My husband had a Blueberry Cheesecake and the one with \"everything\" in it. The ice cream was incredible, and the girl working the counter (with a large hemp necklace) was just as great.

The prices and food were awesome, and the staff was very good as well. If we're ever back in the area, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First off, the atmosphere is intense. There are old school animatronics everywhere. The tables are shadow boxes filled with knicknacks and toys of antiquity. It seems quaint by today's digital standards but that's part of the charm. 

It's somewhere everyone who spends any time in, or driving by (it's 3 minutes off the I, depending on stop lights and along the main drag of East Washington). 

The food is Kosher Deli standard, for the most part. The menu style is the same as ever, which can be a bit hard to read as formatted/organized. Whether you want kugel, a pastrami on rye or whatever, the quality is solid. 

If you have kids, it's even better with the carousel outside, but by no means necessary. All those little motors running means it's not the quietest location, so if you're looking for intimate conversation, this is not the place. Otherwise, give it a whirl."}
{"text":"Dry pastrami on dry bread and overpriced ice cream. The food here is a star less than a  chain diner. Fun for the kids but not worth the money."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when I was a kid with my grandpa and grandma when we visited Madison. So, it has sentimental value and memories. It is extremely unique place, I have never been in a restaurant such as this one. I could literally spend hours looking around at all the fun decorations. Hours. Food is average, ice cream is fun, but the environment and memories are the reason why I would still come back.  

Do not change Ella's Deli. Ever. I promise I will come when I have kids of my own."}
{"text":"This is a fun touristy destination place to go in Madison. The kids were happy,  the grownups were happy, because merry-go-rounds and ice cream are happy things.
They had a baby plate with little things to try for my friend's  little one, which was a nice touch. I had an egg salad sandwich and matzo ball soup, which was OK. I don't like celery, but it's not their fault. Pretty cheap lunch, considering... Wierd thing is that they don't provide crayons and paper for the kids to draw on-which would have been nice. we had a good time with old friends."}
{"text":"Ya know, I didn't have high hopes upon entering this magical circus land cafe.

But - they sure did surprise me.

The soup - you must get the soup.  Homemade - and delicious.  

The reviews are all over the map for this here deli - and I gotta say that my experience was really quite pleasant.  Our server (I wish I remembered her name) was top notch.  She was so sweet and friendly and really made for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I loved going here when I used to live in Madison. Overall, the food is okay, nothing special about it. But, this place seems whimsical to little kids. It's fun to watch them oohs and aahs over neat animatronics. They used to have small carousel set up outside. So, not really a place for foodies, but worth the visit for the little ones."}
{"text":"the review is definitely leaning towards the unique nature of the inside rather than the food, and i can't quite say that i've been to a place like this before.  well, we used to have the submarine thing in California.  

the food is so-so and not priced to match its flavoring.  even when it looks good as they bring it out, it is average deli food.  i concur that the menu is extensive and its really difficult to figure out what want to go for that day.   even soda costs more.  when we were there, there wasn't a whole lot of kids (it was a Sunday late morning), and we got to enjoy playing around with our table (it was the one with iron fillings covering some images, so you can play with it with magnets to form beards over ladies and such).  its a place worth coming to once, but not sure if it is worth a second visit if you're here for the food.  

nonetheless, unique."}
{"text":"This place is definitely for kids. Used to come here all the time when I was a little enjoying all the things on the walls, inside the tables and ceiling and the carousel. 

Now lately just for a quick stop in for ice cream. Which they no longer make besides the vanilla and chocolate used in their sundaes. Now they use Chocolate Shoppe.

Recently stop in for dinner for old time sake. They have extensive menus for both regular and dessert. So takes a long time to read it but it is available online to look over too.

I started off with a kugel. A sweet noodle cheese dish with farmers cheese, sour cream and egg noodles with a side of sour cream and mashed strawberries. Can almost be compared to a cheesecake minus the crust. Now it was mighty tasty and would highly recommend it if you have never had a kugel. But it tasted just like the one I make at home. So I can easily have it at home. Plus I like to add raisins and a nut topping for texture.

For my entree I got Holishkes. sweet & sour stuffed cabbage rolls filled with beef & rice topped with tomato sweet & sour sauce. Comes with a cinnamon muffin, sweetbread a bowl of soup and a choice of two additional side. I got fries and mixed vegetables. For 12.99 I thought it was a good value for the quanity and I left stuffed put that being said. The filling to the cabbage was bland but the tomato sauce helped out there. The muffin was dry. Sweetbread was ok. I got the Sweet & Sour Cabbage soup which was different and could of had a bowl of it. The fries were the frozen kind and the mixed vegetable were peas and carrots. Not a big fan of peas but thats my fault of not asking what kind of veggies.

The service was friendly and laid back put not too badly. But there was only a couple of tables full on a late thursday night. So not sure how it would be busy.

Had no room to try one of their Grilled Pound Cake Sundae my dad loves. A return  visit in the future maybe."}
{"text":"Ok for taking the kids for some ice-cream and to kill some time.

The food is overpriced and not much care is taken for the quality of food they serve.  It's what you would expect from a concession stand or worse.

The servers were fine, but i would not return for any of their menu other than dessert"}
{"text":"I have never had a satisfying meal at Ella's.  They have a few great things, but they are all over-priced, and kinda not worth it.  I mean, the croutons on the salad are delicious, but it's not worth paying $10 for a salad that tastes like the salad bar at Copp's grocery store to get them.  The fried pickles are good, but why would you just order a meal of fried pickles?  The ice cream is okay, but there is better ice cream in Madison.

The atmosphere is cool, but there are always screaming kids to deal with.  Overall, Ella's isn't worth the hype."}
{"text":"I can see how this place used to be a fun spot for children because our 3 year old enjoyed the crazy environment and carousel.  However, it's crossed the line into run down and a little creepy.

The food was horrendous.  The worst we've had since moving to Madison 8 months ago.  And it was very expensive for the quality.  I'm glad we came, saw, and will not be back."}
{"text":"Hmmm... where to begin... OK. If you live in Madison, you have to go to Ella's at least once. I figured I'd check it out, because, it's, like, a Kosher deli and those are hard to find in Wisconsin and I definitely have frequent cravings for good old east coast-style Jewish deli stuff. BUT, I made the huge mistake of not being stoned out of my skull when I went... this place is a trip! What the f*ck is up with the decor? Definitely clutter city in here with all sorts of crazy robotic puppet contraptions and automated devices, toy trains, etc - probably charming in the daytime, pretty weeiirddd late at night. The food was ok - not bad, but a little overpriced considering it wasn't exactly the greatest deli I've ever had, to say the least. It's a cool old place though; definitely has character. I just think the food could be a little better, and the place a bit cleaner. But, if you're, like, f*ckkkin BAKED, MANNN, you probably won't care about those things. Definitely worth checking out for the experience."}
{"text":"I don't have kids, but have been here when others want to entertain. Take out the knick backs, merry go round, and you have an average deli."}
{"text":"This is our granddaughter's favorite restaurant.  There was no other place to celebrate her sixth birthday.
The food is not fancy--but it reminds me of the Jewish delis we visited when I was a kid.
My husband and I shared a \"platter\" with pastrami and corned beef, Swiss cheese, Russian 
dressing and slaw.  Though meant for one person, it was a lot of food for two!
Another person in our party had lox with cream cheese and bagel and she loved it.
And the ice cream was perfect!"}
{"text":"This place was incredibly disappointing. The servers were apathetic, the place was dirty, and the food was average at best. 

This place had a lot of promise, and maybe was a fun place to be in its better days, but my family couldn't get out of there fast enough.

They were out of French fries, and it was only 6pm on a Monday night. The server came outside to hunt us down on the carousel (which was about the only thing my 7 year old and 4 year old seemed to enjoy) to inform us that there were no fries.

We spent nearly $50 on dinner and another $10 on the carousel, and left there feeling like we may have enjoyed fast food more than what we had just experienced. A waste of a meal out!"}
{"text":"If you are reading Yelp, then chances are, this place isn't for you.  I'll just lay out my experience:

-temperature was cold
-the \"binder\" menu felt dirty
-very overpriced
-napkins on the floor
-Reuben sizzler was dry, corned beef was dry, bread was dry
-very overpriced for portions and quality
-sundaes seemed small (I didn't get one)

Now that I think about it, just go to Culver's."}
{"text":"If you go expecting a typical deli experience, forget it. Go for the atmosphere!

We KNEW it was going to be a circus (literally) but even then were impressed/overwhelmed by the place- wild!!

The menu was a surprise- a binder seemingly done by a kid who just discovered Print Shop. 2 pages of banana splits alone, in the $6.75-7.50 range, but then a rather slim drink list. I really felt this could have been done better and still kept the fun feel.

I got a classic Reuben, my wife a Mediterranean Salad, and we shared a delicious Zanzibar dark chocolate banana split. The meal was perfectly good, but the split was delicious! The Reuben was $8.80+2.75 for the combo platter (fries). The fries were perfectly crispy, the side of slaw was nice, and the Reuben could have been a bit thicker for the price but was tasty.

The service was warm and friendly. I suspect the decor drives the staff slightly crazy over time, but it is in a good way. There was a bit of a line at the small check out stand/gift shop but not bad. 

The decor is... is... look, you just got to see it. The various You Tube videos don't do it justice. The small gift shop is equally fun and kitschy.

We'll go back, especially if we can drag along some kids!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the atmosphere, three for the food, four for the desserts and service.

The decor is absolutely amazing.  An overload of spinning everythings, carnival games, Rube Goldberg like machines, everything a kid could possibly by fascinated by.  I also greatly appreciate that not much has changed since my childhood.  They could stand with a little more maintenance (some of the lights are out, some of the spinning things are duct taped) but I'd much rather have that than a full on remodel that loses all of the charm.

The food isnt bad, but it is disappointing, especially for the prices.  Based on what we tried in our most recent visit . . . the fried pickles were great.  My chicken noodle Matzo soup tasted like canned soup with a large stale cracker in it.  My reuben was good but nothing I couldnt get elsewhere.  Other diners in our party enjoyed their food, which included a salad, a hummus plate, a hot dog, chicken tenders, and fries.  The desserts were good-- I mean, how can you have a bad sundae using Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream.

For the record, one of the other reviewers complained about bugs and cleanliness.  I've never seen those issues in decades of going.

Yes, the menus are weird."}
{"text":"I have chosen this place many times for various occasions both as a child and as an adult. Fantasy land was always what kept me coming back and reminiscing of childhood. However a few months ago I had a Jewish co-worker.  We got to talking about eating out. I inquired if his family frequented Ella's (They advertise kosher right on the outside of the building). These were his words, \"They aren't actually Kosher. My family and I were so excited, we went, we sat down, we started asking some questions, and left.\"

I was shocked. This restaurant has many other attractions then it being \"kosher\".  If they aren't kosher, they shouldn't advertise it that way. I'll never eat there again."}
{"text":"Absolutely most crazy place I've been to my entire life, and by far my favorite! Every corner you look at, every inch of every surface, is covered with fun stuff. And it's current! They even have harry potter on a broomstick! An experience like no other. Oh, and get a milkshake!! And good luck choosing which one."}
{"text":"Something different but cool !! The place is great for all ages. The decor is pretty nice, every where you look, you will find something different that will catch your attention. They also have a carousel out side if the kids want to get on it.  We only went to this place for the ice cream because the food doesn't look that great. The ice cream was very good!! The service was excellent too."}
{"text":"One of the most kid-friendly restaurants ever, and know that most of the clientele are going to be of the under-12 crowd. I grew up going to Ella's Deli, and this year I was able to take my 2-year old. She loved it! The matzo ball soup with noodles keeps bringing us back, and you can get pretty much any kind of deli sandwich you can think of at this establishment, and they are all pretty good. The price has certainly crept up over the years, and the cost doesn't match the food quality, which is frustrating. But let's be real - you don't go there for the food quality. You go there for the ambiance -- the 1920s carousel and the explosion of decoration inside.
Oh, and for those complaining about too many loud kids? Look around. Clowns on the wall? Check. Robot greeting you at the door? Yup. Candy counter? Sure thing. Use these context clues, turn around, and find a McDonalds."}
{"text":"This restaurant is now CLOSED.  Their last day was Jan 21.   It was a fun place for kids with some amazing contraptions all over the restaurant and a carousel out front."}
{"text":"Granted it was 90 degrees outside, but it was about 80 inside the restaurant. Air conditioner was not keeping up and it made for a miserable meal. 

The food was mediocre and the waitstaff was slow, uninspired and unfriendly. 

This used to be a neat place to take kids. Don't bother. Find a nicer place- like the Mc Donald's down the street."}
{"text":"Food was average. Ambiance is great for kids. Lots of doodads and trinkets and thingamabobs. Prices were good, especially the lunch specials. $5 meatloaf with mashed potatoes for example. Waiter got soup and salad dressing wrong. It took about 1 hour to get food once seated (an eternity for 3 year olds). It was crowded. There was a wait to get in. They actually ran out of glasses. Matzo ball soup was \"terrible\". The broth tasted like dirty water. Waiter didn't ever check in."}
{"text":"This place was like magic to me as a kid. I used to beg my parents to go here, but now that I'm an adult, I can see why they were reluctant. The food isn't great, and the service is pretty average. That, and the combination of animatronics, knick-knacks, and screaming children is enough to make anyone want to make sure they have some aspirin with their meal.

All in all, it's fun for the kids, but make sure you take it in moderate doses."}
{"text":"When we first visited Madison in 1995 we stopped here with our then 9 year old daughter. It was a good time.  The decor was charming and the ice cream we'd remembered was rich,  creamy and generous. So 20 years later and as a lark,  my wife and I dropped in again. To cut to the chase, I ordered a hot fudge sundae and my wife a strawberry soda. The ice cream was flavorless , granular with ice crystals and certainly less than generous, not that that was a bad thing. I had a ribbon of fudge around the periphery of the glass, a puff of cream and done. No nuts, no cherry but $6.50. I wondered why the menu said extra hot fudge,  .95 cents.  Now I know. I asked my wife about hers. Same flavorless ice cream,  no real strawberries but what to me  tasted like strawberry ester. So basically icy granular ice cream , a shot of pink chemical and some soda water. When asked by our waitress how we liked it I described it as flavorless. \"I'll inform the manager\" was her response. Judging from the myriad complaints about the food going back awhile here on Yelp,  it seems the complaints are falling on deaf ears.  I thought being robbed with a pistol wielding person is the more likely scenario in life than one using a soda glass. Go at your own risk. It's your money. It's Kopp's or Leon's for us."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of this place because the food menu was kind of limited in what I would want to eat, but the food that I did end up choosing was very good. Everyone was nice and friendly there and of course it was a fun atmosphere to be in. The tables even have environments inside of them that are interactive, but unfortunately ours didn't work."}
{"text":"I agree with everyone on the food quality.  Terribly overpriced and subpar at best.  The \"Midwest famous\" Reuben was very small, standard taste and unimpressive, and $9.95 with only a pickle and small cup of coleslaw. Add another $3.25 for crinkle cut fries or another type of potato side.  That is considered the \"combo\"(no drink with that combo though).  

The fried pickles were good as was the coleslaw.  For the price though I expect a lot more.  I was surprised at the amount of business they were doing for that quality at those prices.  

The carnival atmosphere and old time deco with  kitschy props was almost worth another star until we went out to take a ride on the carousel and one of the rudest people I have ever met was running it. He was practically yelling at the kids \"now what are we not supposed to do?\" Before they even entered.  And then he answered every time (because no one knew what he wanted), \"we aren't supposed to run so we can all have fun\"!  He was seriously barking it at kids who hadn't even had the chance to ride yet.  My daughter took a step back behind me and hid. He would make a better surly bartender than someone who greets the kids.  Interesting and fun inside atmosphere though and if you just go for the desserts you are likely to enjoy it more."}
{"text":"As an admitted crusty old fart, one would think that I would stay miles away from Ella's. Quite the contrary my friends. I would not consider a trip to Madison complete without a visit. 

I agree with many that the food is nothing special, but I have never really had a \"bad\" meal here either. I tend to stick to soup and variations on a corned beef / pastrami theme and I do ok. Tonight after spending the day at the anti- Walker / pro union rally downtown, we added a special treat to our usual order. We split the caramel apple crisp (ala mode no less). It was deeeeeeeeelicious!!!!

Anyhow, I come to Ella's time and again because I love the atmosphere. It is as though Rube Goldberg went crazy in a toy factory.  Even in my dotage, I can see this place through the eyes of a child. It helps to keep me young at heart. Yes, it is a bit over the top, but it ranks high on my Kitchy Kool list!!"}
{"text":"SLOW service. Waited 45 minutes after ordering a simple lunch.  Excellent food but you will be VERY hungry when it arrives and water refills were not offered."}
{"text":"Came for dessert for our out of town guest. Ordered pound cake without ice cream. Menu says pound cake great by its self and? even better with ice cream. I can't eat dairy. This man comes over. Doesn't introduce himself and says he is going to have to start inforcing no pound cake without ice cream. Had no idea it was an issue. Why tell me. Wait staff should be informed. Cake was awful anyway. Not coming here anymore."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Ella's in a long time and I was pleasantly surprised on this visit.  They really work hard to maintain all the...I don't even know what to call it...stuff.  Everything in there is moving and dancing and rolling and spinning and it's just a lively atmosphere topped off by a ride on a carousel.  So cool.  Our server was great too.  This would be a 5-star review if their prices were more reasonable for what you get.  I'd be fine with the cost of the reuben if it only had more meat - good fries, good coleslaw, my daughter's hot dog was on a nice bun, but the dog was tiny.  Oh well.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"If being surrounded in a loud, model carnival/circus ambiance is your thing, you might ... ugh, who am I kidding?   The food is crap.  The ice cream is mediocre.  Every surface you touch is sticky.  

You'd think that a \"deli\" that promises the \"Midwest's best reuben sandwich, for over 55 years\" would at least live up to a level of mediocrity, but two bites into a sauerkraut sandwich on sourdough, lightly seasoned with a slice of corned beef, left me physically upset that anyone would serve that to a paying customer.  And then you see the price ... $9.10 for a slice of corned beef on bread?  Really?

1 star deserves at least something nice said ... we had a lot of ... napkins ... I guess.  They stuck to the sticky surfaces."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Madison, I always come to Ella's Deli. Only for the dessert....

I've never had their food. 

The Old Fashioned Banana Split was delicious, especially the pineapple topping. Yum. 

Have fun exploring all of the cool ceiling pieces and neat pieces around the sides."}
{"text":"I was here once. I was so terrified of all the crap and toys and dead doll eyes everywhere that I bolted with my date before ordering with an apology to the waitress. Yeek! This place is like Coraline or something! If your kid is scared of clowns, do NOT go here! Also, the tables are dirty."}
{"text":"Ella's Deli is too close to my house not to go there. I don't see myself ever being a regular, but it's a fantastic place for kids. it keeps them busy and even gets them to eat a little. Ella's needs some major improvements in their food selection. we have bought their ice-cream multiple times and wereways happy with it. When I  finally took my niece there to look at all the amazing decor they have, we decided to give their food a try and it was not impressive at all. we tried their hot dogs and fries, a Ruben and coleslaw and a soup. all of which were bland and happily forgettable. We still left the place with a smile as my niece loved everything she saw there, and ate some of her food even though she didn't like it just to stay there a bit longer."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town.  Thought it might be fun and entertaining for our kids.  I will give it a thumbs up for being very stimulating, over the top, and a bit eccentric....most of our kids got a kick out of the multiple \"moving\" decorations.  On the other hand, the food itself was far from delicious.  Chicken strips were the best option at our table. The burger I ate was charred on the outside and pink on the inside....the bun was rock hard.  My husband had a Chicken sandwich....they must use a frozen chicken patty....not much taste and his bun was just as hard! French Fries were not worth $3.25 upgrade.  
Ice cream was decent....
Would I go again?  One time visit was enough for me."}
{"text":"The food here is terrible. Even the Ice cream is bad. But this has one of the most unique and memorable interiors I've ever seen. And my son loved our light up aquarium table and our seat looking at the carousel. 

One time visit, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Ella's Deli: what dreams and/or nightmares are made of, depending on what you're into. This was my fourth visit to Ella's; it was a place I drove past many times as a kid, but never a place we stopped. I've only experienced it as an adult, and it's a trip.

Highlight: the carousel out front. We rode it once and it was pretty fun. 

Inside, there are toys, puppets, games, and more hanging from and attached to every available surface. You will be overstimulated no matter what age you are. You may be delighted by it all, or terrified. There are a few too many clowns for my taste, but overall I'm more amused than anything. 

Half of my trips have been with small children, and that enhances the experience because they're the ones the entire establishment is aimed at. 

I do love that they have some old-school soda counter favorites like egg creams and phosphates - I loved the phosphate I had years ago on a visit, but this last time the ratios were bit off. 

Food and prices are where Ella's falls most flat, though. Everything on the menu is crazy expensive (a plate of franks & beans is $14.30; a baked potato with broccoli cheese sauce is $10.99; a bagel & lox is $10.15; two-scoop ice cream sundaes are about $8). If the quality was super high I'd understand, but everything I've had has been pretty terrible. Turkey sandwich - bland and not piled high like you would expect of a true deli sandwich. Veggie burger - out of a box, burnt, and served plain on a bun. On this most recent trip I kept it simple and ordered cheese fries for almost $5 - crinkle-cut fries out of a bag covered in processed cheese sauce from a can. This is exactly what I expected for cheese fries, but for the price it's nothing special. 

I do still want to get a group of people together to order the Sparkled Kazoo sundae for the sheer spectacle, and I'll happily tag along with friends who have kids because it's fun watching them try to take it all in. I think in the future, though, I'll skip the food."}
{"text":"OK so really cool place for kids to see with tons of things hanging from the ceiling moving all over with a circus type atmosphere. And this is a kosher Jewish style deli so no bacon or pork chops which is fine with me. However the place is a little dirty overall. Not sure I'd let my kids paw all over the various novelty things in the dining area as many looked awfully tired and dirty. Bathrooms not very clean either. The food was expensive and not as impressive as I had hoped. We split an order of friend pickles which were the best thing we had although they were barely warm when they hit the table. The chicken noodle motza soup was average but again, was barely warm. I had a the pastrami on rye and the meat was ok, a little dry and not very warm and the rye was a little dried out. Sandwich not very big either. After being to some of the NYC delis over the years, I expected a piled high pastrami but it was fairly small. Fries also room temperature warm. A mushroom swiss burger was ordered but seemed mediocre at best and was not finished. Lunch for two was $45 before tip which seemed like a lot of cash for an average lunch. But come on, a bowl of soup $5.20? Soft drinks $2.45 with no refills? A small pastrami sandwich $10 and another $3.25 to add a little pile of crinkle cut fries from your food service distributor? I know this place is a historical icon and a great place to bring little kids but they could at least step up the quality of the food for the prices and maybe close for a day and take some soap and water to the place."}
{"text":"The atmosphere makes this place. It's pure nostalgia and it still reminds me of being a kid. The food is so so. Go with a sandwich. Soup is great. Ice cream is almost a must here. At least check it out if you have kids"}
{"text":"The ice cream is delicious and the atmosphere is one of a kind. It's not amazing food but you don't really go there just to get a stellar meal. I loved this place as a kid and I love it as an adult too. My girlfriends and I have a tradition that anytime one of us has a breakup we go here and split a big ice cream treat. It always makes things better :)"}
{"text":"A whimsical collection of childhood fun. Ella's takes you back to a time unknown with antique toys- all in operation. You can't miss the carousel up front, it screams for attention. 

Once you get inside, it's a rollercoaster of emotions. Overwhelming, almost. There's toys on toys on toys. Above, below, side to side, you can't look anywhere without a monkey popping out of a hat or an elephant rearing its trunk. 

We came for an ice cream date with friends. I really appreciate the \"mini\" scoop they offer in a sugar, cake or bowl for $1.99. The Ella's Birthday Cake is incredible! Quite possibly my favorite ice cream ever, which says a lot considering the great ice cream options that my hometown in Ohio has to offer. 

There's about 25 ice cream options including super man, a rocky road twist and traditional vanillas. I did not get a peek of the menu but while I was scoping it out online, it looked extremely expensive :(

At the check out counter, you'll be pleased to find candy sticks and candy buttons (!!!). You can purchase tokens for the carousel up front and let your little ones enjoy a ride on a Badger mare or Green Bay steed. Overall, excellent place to stop for ice cream on your way through Madison."}
{"text":"Great place for kids.  Sandwich list is HUGE!   Look for Harry playing Quidditch."}
{"text":"If you don't have attention issues, this place is awesome. The food is mediocre, but the toys and collections are extremely entertaining to view throughout the meal. However, if you get easily overwhelmed by noisy places, lots of visual noise, and just general chaos around, I wouldn't recommend Ella's."}
{"text":"Well, my grandkids are in town so I was forced to bring them here. The only time that I ever eat here is when they come to town. One thing is for sure, if not for all the attractions for the kids, this place would never be able to exist.

Starting with the slow footed host with the red clown hair to the assortment of servers who all seem to be rejects from the Ringling Bros side shows, this place is simply horrid.

The wait staff are slovenly and the food quality and presentation is just plain awful. I had a feta and tomato omelet (didn't think even they could screw that up) the chef or cook or whatever they call them at this hell hole neglected to strain the \"fresh\" tomatoes, so the omelet was soaking wet on the inside with 2 large clumps of feta cheese.

My advice is to avoid eating here at all costs, I've lived here 15 years and Ella's has consistently delivered the worse food in town. Kids love seeing all the stuff on the walls and ceilings and of course the merry go round but having to eat a meal here really is cruel and inhuman punishment."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to check Ella's out one night for dinner.

The place was packed with screaming children (which I suppose isn't surprising, considering the carousel and decor - but still, not my bag). Our table was sticky, our silverware wasn't clean, and the food was mediocre. I almost lost my appetite when I looked up at all of the creepy, dusty toys hanging from the ceiling. The only saving grace was the ice cream - but in Madison, you can get good ice cream just about anywhere.

I know this place is a Madison institution, and I really wanted to like it, but mostly it just grossed me out. I might order food or ice cream to go, but I will not dine in the restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Great if you're under 5yrs old and care only about the cartoon themed decor and merry go round. My children love this place. I enjoy seeing how amused they are...which is the only reason I give this place 3 stars.

The food deserves 1-2 STARS. There needs to be more attention to the food here. The food is meh...not enjoyable or tasty at all.

I will most likely not dine here again. However I will drop by with the kiddos for dessert and a few rides on the merry go round."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to write a review, but now I feel compelled. Stop in for lunch after children's museum. Had to ask to be seated after being ignored. Food was ok (chicken matzo had mictoparticles of chicken/carrot and mutes flavor...Ruben was good). There was a server and a buser talking in the corner booth. The buser was swearing every third word. He could see me and my family with a 3 and 5 year old, but still carried on. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Cute, worth taking the kids to, food is solidly okay. You go to Ella's more for the experience than the cuisine."}
{"text":"Yes the prices are high because you are paying for the experience as much as the food.  (There's a restored carousel included with your meal!!!). This place is jam packed with entertainment. Most a kids fantasy and mine is almost 17 years old.  She made us stop when she saw it from the road.  ( we were passing through to breakfast somewhere downtown)
I think you have to know what to order.  The French toast plates were AMAZING!  Huge fluffy pieces of challah bread lightly dipped and grilled.  And it's enough for two, possibly three people so share.  The 3  of us should've only ordered two eye also had a side of corned beef, offered instead of bacon, with that.
I had Ella's plate:  scrambled altogether:  eggs, lox and onions with bagel.  Delicious.   Stick to the breakfast menu.
Waitress was great:  covering a party of 5 adults plus 6 children  next to us but was right there to refill drinks throughout.
This is such a fun place.   Keep looking around and you'll see something new.  Every table is some sort of game or toy.  It's amazing all the antiques here.

The only reason this isn't five stars?  Omg, the hostess.  We almost walked out before she seated us.  She looks like she would rather die than be there.  Equally as miserable ringing up our $50 tab.  Leaves you sad and this isn't a sad place.  Too bad."}
{"text":"If you like sensory overload from Rube Goldberg contraptions this is your place. Don't let the word \"deli\" fool you. The food is so so but get a sundae or milk shake. I read reviews that its not as good as it used to be, it never was you just grew up."}
{"text":"Loved it! Had borscht and nova lox and it was delicious. I am from out of state, I wish my daughter was here she would love it! Staff was friendly and service great. I will be back any time I come to Madison"}
{"text":"If you like kitsch and ice cream this is the place for you! Great selection of deli favorites from matzoh ball soup to Reubens to blitzes and more. The kids will lose their minds with all the stuff going on here."}
{"text":"We were meeting a couple people quickly in Madison, and not knowing the place at all - decided to meet up at the \"giant carousel place\". We pulled in and were pleasantly surprised by the large dedicated parking lot. 

Inside the situation gets insane. Right when you walk in you are at risk of poking an eye out with the millions of flying things. There are unicyclists, clowns - even a harry potter on a broomstick that are hanging from wires all over the place. 

There were tons of tables that had kitschy little trinkets under the glass - some even moved and were interactive! The server station is in the middle of the restaurant. The menu looks like a different middle schooler designed each page. The deli, which is what they started as, is down to about 10 logs of meat. The ice cream selection was good, and we both settled only for a cone and not a meal. The 'gift shop' area was a cramped little cash register with some old candy, creepy stuffed animals and little knick knacks. 

While we didn't eat, the reviews of the food seem fine enough. The carousel is cute and a nice little addition. Not sure I'd ever venture specifically to come here, but it was a cute little meeting spot."}
{"text":"I've never been here before now and I wish as a little kid, I would have had to opportunity to come to a place like this! It was such a good experience. 
It was a little weird to be an adult without a child there but they still treated us the same. Our waiter was a little awkward but the food was fantastic and the ice cream was perfect at the end of our meal. 
Unfortunately, I don't plan on staying in the Midwest long enough for me to have children here but if I did, this would be a regular thing for my family!"}
{"text":"This place is still in business for the ambience, not the food.  But that's ok.  I still think everyone should go at least once.  If you're just there for the ice cream, then that's perfect, as its chocolate shoppe ice cream, and the dessert menu is 3x as big as the food menu. :D"}
{"text":"As long as you look at the ceiling, you're in a world of fantasy. Unfortunately you sometimes have to look at your plate, where things are not as fantastic."}
{"text":"The food is okay but not great, but you have to experience this place at least once, especially if you have kids.  There's a carousel outside and inside there are so many things for the kids to look at from Dumbo flying across the restaurant to singing feet! Last time we were seated near the front door and I loved watching the kids walk in and just stare at the ceiling. We've only had sandwiches and they are okay..nothing real special. Ice cream is good and you get a lot for the money. An interesting and different place. Try it at least once for the experience."}
{"text":"I am not longer a youngin but oh boy do I remember the fun I had here. Decorations more like deteriorations! The ice cream is good but where can you find bad ice cream in Wisconsin.

The red haired host dude is creepy and enjoys staring at customers. I was  too generous in what I said, he LEERS.

Gross."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years food is good not spectacular or anything but hubby likes the pastrami old school crinkle fries reminds me rennies the food is overpriced imo chilli was awful kids meals ok don't get the hot dogs unless your kids are use to kosher dogs ice cream is very good recommend the grilled pound cake sundaes many times we come just for ice cream service is generally solid a few bad times but probably been here 60 times the atmosphere is 5 stars for families games built into the tables a menagerie of things in the air plus the carousel out front I'd give it 4 stars but I always feel I should get more for buck"}
{"text":"If this place had better food, I might come visit Madison more often just for the fabulously weird animatronic awesomeness that is Ella's decor. The tables are interactive games! There's Harry Potter and Sponge Bob flying around the ceiling! There's a giant robot and a giant banana!  I could go on and on.  If there's even a fragment of an inner child hidden inside of your ragged adult exterior, you HAVE to come see this.

All of this awesomeness is the only reason why I'm giving this place three stars, because the food they served us was abysmal.  As a Jew, I'm kind of horrified that this place has the word \"deli\" in it.  We shared the holischkes, which is a much-beloved stuffed cabbage dish prepared by Jewish grandmothers everywhere.  Ella's \"holischkes\" consisted of undercooked cabbage and stringy beef. Worst of all, instead of simmering the cabbage rolls for hours in sweet-and-sour sauce, these imposters had spaghetti sauce blopped on top!  This was served with boxed mashed potatoes and bad canned gravy, along with limp, defrosted frozen peas and carrots.  If someone tried to serve this on the East Coast, the cook would have a line full of angry Jewish grandmothers giving him a piece of their minds.

My daughter's bagel and lox tasted okay.  But the bagel was clearly from a package -- not deli worthy!  The ice cream was okay -- my husband had a good malt, but the so-called famous pound cake sundae was mediocre and very overpriced.  The grilled pound cake just tasted stale.

Would I go again? Well, probably.  Like other Yelpers have said, going for ice cream and skipping the food is probably the way to go."}
{"text":"Gave this place a visit again as we were in Madison. It has become one of our family's fav restaurant to go to everytime when we are in Madison not for food but to check on all the toys they have in there.
All the creations are amazing and look like made with love. Owner Ken shared his story of his love for Carousels and how he has spent hours creating each and every one of them over the past 40 yrs.
Food Menu is very very elaborate and has good portion size.
A must visit with kids for all the fun and action in there!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times since moving to Madison a few months ago.  My son and the kids of friends who I have brought here love all of the gizmos flying around and the interactive tables.

For a cheery place like this, the wait staff isn't as chipper as you would think.  Additionally, it takes FOREVER to get your food.  Okay, not forever, but I mean, c'mon, it shouldn't take 30 minutes to get a kid's hot dog and fries.  One time I waited nearly an hour at the restaurant to pick up an order of 3 regular combos and a kid's combo.

As for the food, it's okay.  I usually get a sandwich, either a reuben or a grilled cheese, and whatever I get is usually good but isn't worth the price. What's weird is that the two times that we ordered take out, each time my sandwich tasted better than when I've eaten it at the restaurant.

However, I would go back because the kids love it and though it is expensive, sometimes it's easier for someone to make me a reuben than to make one at home.  Plus, one of these days I'd like to try the pound cake sundae.  That sounds good."}
{"text":"If you  have young or young at heart children you need to bring them here at least once..the decor can keep someone with add sitting still...wait staff is pretty friendly..food by and large was just ok and a little pricey for what you got, that being said the menu is very expansive and i cant imagine someone going there and not being able to find something they want to try..there is a carousel out front for kids to ride which is another plus for the kids."}
{"text":"The only thing that has changed at Ella's in 20 years is the cover of their menu.  It's refreshing to know that papier mache rots slower than my mind does.  With tables, walls and ceilings buzzing with mechanical toys and games, and a full-fledged carousel operating during the summer, the environment proves to be kid-friendly, although as a kid I recall my taste buds not being well adapted to the bitter Kosher-style deli flavors I now eat with zeal: sweet and sour cabbage soup, open-faced reubens piled high with sauerkraut and swiss cheese (all this along with a side of cole slaw, and perhaps my zealousness is truly just geared towards cabbage), noodle kugel, cheese blintzes.  My \"mature\" taste buds still cringe at the sight of tongue sandwiches and gefiltefish, but I can look past this.  Treat yourself to a salad --- their croutons are fried in magical high-penetrating butter.  Their ice cream comes courtesy of Madison's local Chocolate Shoppe, and is made ever the more extravagant when served over pound cake and topped with hot fudge."}
{"text":"Great for kids, a lot of fun. The ongoing attractions keep kids entertained all night. The carousel is great when its open. Decent food."}
{"text":"Expensive!!!!
That is the only word I have for Ella's.  We ate here on a Saturday for lunch.  It had great ambiance and the kids loved it.  There were 4 of us.  We all had sandwiches and my cousin and I shared a $12 sandwich plate with all the fixins.  My wife and his girlfriend had sandwiches and we ordered 3 drinks and a water.  The kids ate off of our plates as they always do.  I figured the bill was going to be around $40 because we didn't even order ice cream.  3 drinks, 2 sandwiches and 1 \"shared sandwich\" and our bill was $61.62.  WTH?!?!?!?

I went over it with a fine-tooth comb and noticed they charge almost $5 for a small order of cheese fries.  The drinks were $3 each and their sandwiches were over $10 each.  WTH?!?!?!?!?

I couldn't believe how much they charge for cold meat sandwiches.  We could have spend $40 at Panera and had more food and much higher quality.

It looks like this place is getting a lot of bad reviews lately.  I really hope they are reading their Yelp page and they fix things.  I will never go back here again.  I can eat at a nice steak house for $60.  Cold meat sandwiches aren't worth as much as this place charges for them.  Ripoff Central.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Sad face :(
No, wait. A GIANT SAD FACE :(

Why doesn't this birthday place have a better selection of cake? I'm a traditionalist, and I'd like to have a nice pice of layered cake on my birthday. My friend took me here on my b-day, and as soon as I saw the dessert menu, my heart started sinking .... . There was nothing I wanted to eat. Sigh. 

I ended up sharing a lame chocolate cake with him. Another sigh. 
I felt bad to be such a downer when someone was treating me .... but the cake really bummed me out!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this two different ratings. The atmosphere is over-the-top entertaining for kids (unless they have sensory issues, then it's gotta be pure torture). It's unique and crazy enough that I would give that part 3.5 stars. I'm pretty sure most kids would say it's a 5 star atmosphere, but they're not the ones paying the ridiculous prices, so their vote doesn't get as much credibility.

I do remember as a kid enjoying their ice cream and I think that's probably what it should stick with--ice cream. Not sure how many people order the \"tongue,\" but I couldn't even bring myself to go with a burger and fries. My 6 year old and I split a serving of French toast (6 large slices in the one order). That was $7.99. The little tiny cup of strawberries to put on top was an extra $1.50 or was it $1.75? At least it was real recognizable fruit. The French toast was fine, but I prefer what we make at home. Thus, for the food (which grant it, wasn't a huge sample size) I would give it a 2. I am guessing their ice cream probably rates higher. 

Admittedly, I was quick to pull into the driveway when we happened to pass by it suddenly after a long day in Madison. I used to go here often as a kid (my mother must have been a saint) and wanted to share that experience with my own child. I guess 25+ years makes you forget a few things, like that the food isn't that great. C'est la vie.

The bathrooms during our visit were wet and muddy with trails of toilet paper on the floor, but thankfully weren't too nasty in other ways. The restaurant itself seemed clean enough. Our wait staff was courteous. Know that the outdoor carousel is a $1.00 a ride, although apparently if children are held on your lap  then the lap-rider is free.

Would I go back? Just on my own, no. With my child, probably for some ice cream and a carousel ride."}
{"text":"Some things never change. Ella's Deli is one of those things. 

I've been coming here with friends and family for more years than I care to mention. My grown daughter was pretty much prenatally raised on their food, as I was probably here weekly when I was carrying her. We have visited for nearly every family occasion of note ever since. 

The amazing thing is that the food has not changed one bit. I still order the same thing every time I visit, after all these years, and looking at the plate, I could not tell you if it was 2015 or (mumble-long-ago-year-mumble). There are a few new items, but not many. Beer and wine are a recent addition, but who goes to Disneyland and drinks? I dunno, I guess some people do, but I've never felt compelled to order alcohol here.

Most of the same robotic toy things are still in place, although many could use repair and a good dusting. (Poor Michael Jordan's arm is falling off, and the wizards are slumped over their magic acts like something went terribly awry in their performance.) Some of the same familiar staff faces are still there. They've changed from house made ice cream to Chocolate Shoppe, but nothing wrong with that. The prices have taken quite a jump, but I guess that is what it is. 

Our waitress was spectacular this weekend, even though she missed writing down lettuce for my sandwich, she didn't accuse me of not saying it, as seems to be the case for restaurant staff too often. She just brought me some., with zero attitude. Her bright smile and cheery demeanor was admirable in such a screamy-child environment. There was a hostess (tall, large blonde) that was going off on some customers, though, I'm not sure what her deal was. 

So, not a perfect experience, but for the most part super predictable and always fresh, quality, delicious food. Visitors to Madison with children should *not* miss it. Anyone who loves good deli food (and can tolerate shrieking for short periods of time) should also not miss it. Still a big fan."}
{"text":"By far the best kid friendly restaurant to take your kids. I live in the SF Bay Area now and my kids cannot wait to go back to Ella's Deli when we visit Madison to see Grandma and Grandpa. I wish we had one in Cali."}
{"text":"A hoarders paradise.  The food was OK, but I thought the ice cream was good.  Gaudy and too much SH**  everywhere.  We came here on a recommendation from someone in our group as a meeting place on our way to the Dells.  They have a huge menu, but NO Specialties.  I would imagine everything is frozen and cooked when you order it.  The tuna salad is made with Egg, which I have never seen before and did not like.  Not much of a micro beer selection (kind of expected), but they have Guinness, and two from New Glarus.  I will not be back, but I am sure some people will be.  Not my scene."}
{"text":"Great family entertainment, decent food.  Don't come here expecting a gourmet feast, it is for the kids.  Although, the reuben was good and the potato salad was also pretty good.  A little pricey, but you are paying for the atmosphere as well.  The carousel is only open in warm months  (whenever those are ;)."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that they got rid of all their cool vintage candy and replaced it with dollar-store toys charging $10 per toy, RIGHT where everybody has to wait in line to pay for their food.  Seriously.  Nobody wants to pay the pretty penny to eat here only to have their experience end with having to choose between a disappointed child or an even-more-complete ripoff.

Absolutely not worth the money.  

To top it off, my youngest child thankfully wasn't into the toys and chose a lollipop that broke in her hand within seconds.  I could tell the clerk was almost going to say something to us when I replaced it with an unbroken one.  Really??  After we paid $30 for 3 ice creams, a bowl of soup, and a cheap toy????"}
{"text":"We've been here several times.  Ella's is a pretty well known spot in Madison for NY style deli sandwiches/soups and ice cream.

The location is full of kitschy toy stuff, on the ceilings, on the walls and even inside the wooden tables where games can be played while your waiting for or eating your meal. The result of all the activity is that it is actually a noisy, clangy, plop-plop sounding place. Ella's is definitely targeting families with kids.

The location has a smaller version of an old-style carousel near the building, outside in the parking lot that brings back memories of days spent at Griffith Park in Los Angeles where it was a real thrill to ride the super-sized carousel.

The food here is AOK.  But, IMHO, this place is just about the experience, first, and the food, second.  Having said that, their hot sweet and sour cabbage soup with tidbits of beef is outstanding, as are their salads."}
{"text":"Ella's is an oddity but a child's haven.  It depends on why you're going here, if you're two grown adults and going to eat, the food is mediocre at best and very expensive. A plain as Jane tuna sandwich on regular bread is $10 and add an extra $3.25 for frozen krinkle cut fries. However, if you're a child, it's a sensory overload. The room is filled with wind up old toys, it's amazing. Even each table to dine at is decorated in toys, badger paraphernalia, clowns or something fun. The outdoor carousel is a must do. $1.50 and my niece screamed with joy! This place is great for some ice cream and to entertain a child."}
{"text":"I had fond memories of the Ella's Deli on State Street - and the fried pound cake in particular - and figured it would be a good second choice for brunch with my daughter when we found Monty's Blue Plate Diner was too busy on our visit to Madison.  What a mistake!  The restaurant itself is a kitschy tourist trap, with grime-covered mechanical toys littering the entire restaurant.  Entertaining for some perhaps, I found it extremely depressing.  The wait for our food seemed interminable, and when it did arrive, my omelet was cold, flat, and hardened.  I practically wanted to cry, realizing we had missed an opportunity for a wonderful breakfast at Monty's - much less, that we had shelled out as much as we had for a disgusting breakfast at Ella's.  I will not ever come back if I can help it."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING! 
I really want to just leave it at that, but that wouldn't be right. 
So let me tell you why I will never eat at Ella's again. 

For starters, it takes FOREVER until somebody comes over to seat you. Today I asked if I could sit in a booth, I wanted to pop out the laptop and needed some room to groove. I was walked over to the booths that line the one side of the restaurant and with the exception of the one that was occupied by a group of four, every single booth was overrun with dirty plates and glasses. Nothing says, \"Come in, sit down, stay a while\" like tables full of dirty shit. 

And so I was sat at a table. A table just a little too close to the server station, which is actually a server island. It's huge. And why? Stupid use of space. And a liiiiiiitle to visible. Today my lunch was punctuated by a dirty bus tub that stayed on the floor for mmmm 30 minutes before someone decided to pick it up and take it somewhere a bit more out of sight. And when she did, it was replaced by another bus tub, so servers could drop off more dirty shit instead of running it to the back. 

I won't go in to detail, it's not worth it, but suffice it to say it was rank. I almost lost it when a server dropped a few plates into the bin but sort of missed, making it so a smattering of fries blanketed the floor. Again, disgusting. 

I can't even comment on the food because my whole experience was tainted by the sight of ketchup smears, ice cream sundae remnants and those unruly stray fries. The only thing I kept thinking, \"If this is their solution to clearing tables, I wonder what they think cleaning dishes means.\" 

Someone in Madison, please start making Matzo Ball soup. It's the only reason I went to Ella's but not even that is enough to get me to step foot in there after today. I would have to throw out the shoes I was wearing after and I have nice shoes."}
{"text":"Oh, Ella's, I feel like you used to be a lot better when I was younger. I can't specifically tell if the quality has decreased (though other recent reviews imply that may be the case) or if I've always been blinded by all the toys and the carousel, but this visit was just not as enchanting as all my previous visits over the years.

The surly teenager acting as host? Mmm yeah, maybe not the best face you want to be showing your customers when they walk into the door? Gosh, that kid was all grumps and monotone and unwelcoming. 

The food is a little drier than I remember it being. Why did you stop being a grease hole, Ella's? That was part of your thing! A Reuben on dry toast is not how I remember your Reubens. And why was my aunt's Reuben baked potato just a dried, baked potato with Reuben toppings? 

Your ice cream is still pretty good, so the next time I stop in I'll just get a shake and skip the solid food."}
{"text":"By far the worst restaurant I have been to in a long long while. The food was horribly over priced. The service was awful. The portions aren't worth 1/4 of what's paid even the water that we ordered came in a cup that was no more than 6 oz. The restaurant has so much going on with the atmosphere it ruined any value of conversation you could have. The food was awful. The ice cream was unoriginal which is all this place could have had to keep it some what worthy of my money. I will never return to this place and I do not suggest any of you do either."}
{"text":"If I had to sum up my meal in two words: odd brunch. I started the meal with a kugel & strawberries based on another yelper's review - ate almost the whole thing! Would def order it again or serve it for guests at a brunch. Yum. The matzo soup tasted OK, felt like it was surrounded by canned chix noodle (ala Cambell's) though. Entre was holishkes (bland cabbage rolls with chunky marinara sauce), the sides seemed like random afterthoughts and portion size was enormous. My daughter ordered the kid's mac & cheese with a side of applesauce (which is always served in a ridiculously tiny cup). The wait staff were friendly and accommodating. It can be overwhelming and claustrophobic on a busy night but Sunday night was as chill as it gets. Next time I'm sticking with my fave dish there: open-faced tuna melt. Can't go wrong there.

The menus just kill me... I have learned over the years how to navigate them quickly but seriously Restaurant Impossible needs to come in and revamp here! A simplified menu featuring well made dishes to compliment some home made ice cream would have an immediate positive impact. That and some cleaned up, contemporary, functioning decor would really breathe some life into this place! We'll never stop coming here but will enjoy it MUCH more with some improvements. I'm rooting for ya Ella's!"}
{"text":"Not a great place for large groups. Went with my brother and his family, 10 of us total. It took TWO HOURS for sandwiches and ice cream. It used to be a great place."}
{"text":"Overpriced and blah food. Culver's makes better food than this. If you are expecting a great New York Deli experience, skip this."}
{"text":"if you have autism, stay the hell away from this place.  looks like mercer mayer blew up in there.  lots of ice cream and strange gadgets as far as the eye can see.  at night, the inside looks like a tool video.  very fun place if you are under ten.  or like ice cream."}
{"text":"I've been talking about this search for the perfect reuben for so long that people are starting to wonder. I figured that I'd better start documenting this search lest people begin to question my dedication to the task at hand.

I hadn't been to Ella's since I relocated to Madison 7yrs. ago. So I figured that this Madison Institution would be a good place to start. So, the sandwich was pretty decent. The corned beef was delicious and not too greasy. I don't know why they don't serve it on a dark rye, like most every other place I've had one (we'll forget the sourdough I had once in the north woods). Loss of points here. My only other gripe would be that they could have spared some fries and made a bigger sandwich.

The reason for the two star rating is the service I received. I was one of maybe four customers in the whole place (everyone else was already seated and eating when I arrived), and it still took ten minutes for a staffer to bring a cup of water. The server's demeanor was short and far from sweet.

So, bring the kids to Ella's. That's the demographic they're going for. It's like Chuck-E-Cheese for the pre-teen steampunk crowd. If you're looking for a decent reuben in Madison, get it to go."}
{"text":"As a Madison-area native for most of my life, taking a trip to Ella's Deli has always been a delight. As a kid I can remember going around the whole restaurant, investigating each table's theme and enjoying the toys flying overhead. That same atmosphere remains today, and it's a big reason why Ella's remains a go-to destination for my family (including my young son) today.

The menu is diverse, and you'll likely find something to your liking if you go in without knowing what's there. The basic foods are, well, basic -- don't expect a cheeseburger to be anything more than what it is -- but their specialties are well worth going back for.

With a carousel out in front, the fun toys and amusement inside, and a delicious menu to top it all off, you'll want to keep Ella's Deli in your repertoire for when friends visit from out of town. This staple of Madison dining isn't \"fine dining,\" but it's enjoyable nonetheless."}
{"text":"Well, I will warn you: do NOT go here if you are currently tripping on anything. The crazy animatronic things everywhere will GET YOU. Also, screaming spawn and their usually smug breeder parents. On the plus side, they have great matzo ball soup and great blintzes. BLINTZES! Yes. So, if you have a kid, take them there at least once. They'll remember it for a long time. Also: word through the grapevine is that this place is not actually kosher."}
{"text":"This is the first place we take visitors when they come to Madison. We love to see the\"shock and awe\" on their faces when they see all the antique toys, flying puppets, games, carousels and other childhood delights crammed in cheek by Joel. It's a real Jewish deli, too. Very good food. They make the best matzo ball soup. We tried the blintzes as an appetizer because we were curious.  They were creamy, not too sweet and served with a choice of fruit preserves. I tried the holitchkes - stuffed cabbage rolls- and they were meaty and flavorful with a delicious tomato sauce on top. The only negative was that the cabbage was a little tough. The portions were very generous."}
{"text":"I got a visit in before this Madison treasure closes up on 1/21.  Me and a small group went for desserts.  There was a line out the door.  My wait was about 30 mins but we were okay waiting to have our good bye moment.

The wait staff were moving fast to clear tables as quick as folks left.  And they did it with smiles and grace.  They were generous with snapping pictures of the patrons and answering questions about the closing.  I was so impressed with their service.

One member of my party got the pasta and cheese.  It looked like a Velveeta cheese sauce over noodles but she liked it.  

Three of us ordered the Grilled Pound Cake Sundaes.  The fudge one was always my favorite.  One ordered a blueberry and she loved it.  The little one in our group ordered Superman Ice Cream served in a dish.  And one got Root Beer Float.  It came in a tall glass and looked fantastic.

We savored our treats.  Reminisced about past visits.  And we had a great last visit.  Thank you Ella's Deli for my fun childhood memories and being a nice place to come as an adult to remember those times.  You will be missed. 

If you go before they close, go with patience as there will be a line.  The business will close at 3pm on 1/21"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  I grew up in Wisconsin, and this was a frequent visit with my parents.  It's a kids paradise!  Merry-go-round, fun food, ice cream, and the place is decorated with toys.  Something to look at everywhere.  Plus, you can buy candy buttons when you are leaving :0)"}
{"text":"It's so sad to see this place going down the hole.

I have very fond childhood memories getting ice cream and riding the merry go round.

This last time might have been the last time. It was dirty, the staff is a whole other story, the place looked like it needed some serious TLC.

Note to whoever is the owner or in management, don't let an awesome nostalgic place like this fall due to you and your staffs laziness."}
{"text":"I ordered a French dip here for dinner the other night, and there was a very large brown insect right there on the plate, floating dead in the au jus.

They covered the price of our bill, at least. But it's still disgusting to think that their sanitation is lax enough that a bug can end up right on a customer's plate. Neat toys and animatronics aside, this place sorely needs a visit from the health inspector."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, incredible food, friendly staff and a carousel.  We purposefully stopped on our drive from NC to MN and it was worth it.  Cheese curds, Kugel and blintzes - comfort food, fantastically wonderful comfort food. Take time to stroll around and look at all the incredible mechanical sights.  You can't but leave happy and full."}
{"text":"Was very busy the day we went and maybe they weren't prepared. Waited in line for 20 minutes and took an hour to get our food. Definitely not worth the wait. Reuben was just ok and fries cold. The fried dill pickle were the highlight. Great place to take the kids and look at all the cool toys but the food seems secondary."}
{"text":"Ella's Deli, an iconic restaurant here in Madison. I've been visiting this particular location on and off over the last 20 years or so. More so when our kids were younger, and when we lived just a few blocks away. The carousel of course has always been the main attraction and highlight. Even now, when it's open for the season, I, and my now teen/s still take advantage of a little ride once around. Now, about the inside atmosphere and food: yes, I won't deny it's a bit \"gritty\" so to speak. Sure, it could use some updating, but there's something nostalgic and kitschy about the original flooring, tables, counter tops. There's a lot of hoopla, movement, color, and mechanical paper mache characters moving above your head, that always seem to mesmerize youngsters, and a few elders I know as well. The food is, for the most part very good. It's one of these places I tend to order the same old, same old, because I'm never disappointed. I always loved the open face platters of turkey and gravy over mashed potatoes. The open face corned beef reuben on rye is always amazing and so is the sweet and sour cabbage soup. Mmmmmm.... love it. Fries are always yummy from my experience and the blue cheese burger is also good. I veered off my normal path recently and ordered the blueberry and blue cheese salad with walnuts. Loved it! The owners are very sweet people and take a lot of pride in their restaurant. I highly recommend stopping by when the weather is nice and the carousel is up and running. they keep the carousel and horses maintained and freshly painted often. I think they are doing right by keeping Ellas Deli up and running traditionally as most folks that come in, expect it to be as they remember it, and revel and reminisce in all that they always loved."}
{"text":"I've been longingly gazing at Ella's for years now every time I visit Madison. Now that I've finally moved here, I convinced my friends to pile in the car and give it a try! 

........REGRETS. 

First of all, what the nuts is going on inside?! So overstimulating. Then we were plopped down at a tacky table with an entire binder for a menu, with tabs separating all 599 meals they have, and the server didn't offer to explain anything. We were shocked at the prices, and served literally the worst meal I've ever paid for. My \"Cheese Frank\" was a cheap hot dog, in a bun that I'm assuming was leftover from 1942, with two half melted/half cold slices of kraft singles. 

We opted to skip desert, because who wants to pay $9 for a sundae after experiencing that \"quality\" of food for dinner?!

When I asked the hostess to split our bill, she looked utterly annoyed that I would inconvenience her on a dead wednesday evening, and  snakily complied. 

So so so so so so so so SOOOOO disappointed with my experience here. I won't ever go back, and I won't ever let my friends go back. YIKES.  I love food more than anything in this world, and that was not food. Don't waste your money or your time here."}
{"text":"Here's what I think: Once upon a time, this was an actual Jewish deli. Like maybe 40-80 years ago. Now? It's a midway for the kiddie rides. 

Here's what we waited 45 minutes: two orders of god-knows-how-old frozen crinkle fries, a grilled cheese that's exactly what a kid wants, only 35 minutes faster, and three blintzes from a box of frozen Empire blintzes, nearly burnt, with a thimbleful of applesauce. (The blintzes cost $10, btw, which makes them only about 4x what you'd pay at the supermarket.) The place is hot and sweaty and, yeah, kinda gross.

Took another forever to get the check. Would have gnawed a leg off to escape if I weren't already feeling crummy from the frozen blintzes. 

I bet if you're six and you go at 3 pm on a Thursday with your grandpa, it's awesome, just because of all the insane mechanical toys on the ceiling and the little carousel. But if you're not six or saintly, you should not go."}
{"text":"At the end of Back To The Future 3, creepy little Verne Brown signals and points to his crotch, when Doc is saying goodbye to Marty. No one knows why he did this. Well, a young girl was standing behind Marty. In fact, young Verne was known to do this and instead of moving to the next town like a logical person, Doc shifted his family from town to town in different time periods until the family landed in 1960's Madison. Verne was introduced to the \"Hippie\" lifestyle and soon changed his sex offender ways. Doc took this as an omen, he settled in and started a family restaurant. Ella's Deli was born.

I have an affinity for the creatively absurd, and only an absurd mind like Doc Brown's could have came up with such craziness. The decor is worth the price of a meal alone. Various cartoon characters from different generations float across the ceiling on motorized pulleys. Creepy clowns jump up and down on ledges. Pool balls travel along multiple tubes and contraptions across the entire ceiling. Each table had a diorama built inside of it. My 9 month old didn't stop looking around the whole time we were here.

Speaking of which, this might be the most family friendly restaurant I have ever been to. Along with the decor, there's a full size Merry Go Round outside of the place. The food is also very kid friendly, this is the first place I found with an \"under 2 plate\". Anyone with a kid who is just starting to eat knows how tough it is to go to a restaurant and try to share your food. They can only eat certain things, and everything has to be chopped up in little bits. Ella's makes this easy, putting yogurt, shaved turkey, crackers, peas and carrots, mandarin oranges, shredded cheese and applesauce on a tiny plate, charging us a little over 2 bucks. 

As far as the food goes, it's slightly above average. I had a Midwestern Burger, topped with a little horseradish sauce and big fried pickles. The burger was average, but the fried pickles were surprisingly good. My wife had the Garden burger which was good as well.

Dinner was pretty ho-hum, not bad but not the best. Then we had our socks knocked off with dessert. We shared a Turtle Grilled Poundcake Sundae, which was fantastic. We were fighting for spoonfuls, as the toppings were well balanced with the ice cream. So many times you get a turtle sundae and there is too much caramel or fudge, this one was perfect. I wanted to bring home some of the Poundcake to eat on its own (I wonder if they sell it to go? I should have asked).

This trip wasn't without its negatives. The actual food menu itself is unbelievably confusing, some of the items are listed twice in different parts of the menu, and it's pretty much hard to read. They should have someone clean it up. It took forever to be served. I know I came on Saturday during lunch, but we should be served a lot quicker than the over half hour we waited from putting in the order to be served our food.

Fun for all ages. I you haven't yet, you should dine here."}
{"text":"Been stopping here since the early 80's. The deli is kosher and I have'nt ate off the food menu for many years. Mom and I stopped here for a sundae as usual and the turtle sundae's are excellent! I had the poundcake turtle sundae and mom the regular turtle sundae as the poundcake has cinamon in it and she's allergic.

This place is a must stop on our roadtrips!"}
{"text":"Lots of fun to look at.  There is so much random stuff around the ceiling and the walls and outside and behind the counter... you get the idea.  The menu is extensive.  The Rueben is alright.  I have had better.  But since there is so much more to try maybe something else is better."}
{"text":"Today had cream of potato soup and a bacon cheeseburger for lunch. Can't imagine how it could be better.  Clean operation with courteous help, good food and fair prices."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing. Now it sucks. The food is awful. The desserts are awful. The service is awful. I went twice recently just to give it a second chance but it was still bad. Even the decorations are falling apart/not moving anymore. The ONLY thing worth getting still is the matzo ball soup and maybe the fried pickles. 
Breaks my heart, they should call Robert Irvine or Gordon Ramsey."}
{"text":"The environment was fun and exciting for our two little kids. However the sloooow service really brought down my rating of it. Expect to be there for a while even when they're not busy. Food was good, but not worth the price you'll pay for it. It was a fun place for the kids to go to, but not sure I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Emailed owners twice to ask if they had vegan options and they ignored my emails. Seems like it used to be nice but has gone downhill."}
{"text":"I miss Ella's Deli. There was just something so magical about it. 

Maybe it's my memories of riding the carousel as a child. Maybe it's the whimsical decorations that filled the interior. Maybe it's just this idea I've had in my brain about what Ella's is - was - since I was very young. 

The food was never outstanding, but it wasn't bad either! I always had good service. The ice cream was fantastic. 

I can't honestly think of a bad thing to say about Ella's Deli. It's a place that I wish Madison was able to keep going forever. There will never be another like it."}
{"text":"Decent food with a family friendly environment.  Smells a little weird."}
{"text":"Stopped & picked up a pastrami & corned beef deli platter, and 2 bowls of Matzoh ball soup for me & hubbs for lunch. The platter & soup fed both of us no problem, with leftovers. All quite good, and the potato salad is REALLY good. Will definitely do again!"}
{"text":"This is not a dinner destination but an ice cream carnival. I love the mechanical displays in the tables and all the overhead whatnots."}
