{"text":"Facebook pointed me to this place while I was visiting Scottsdale.  good coffee and the curry chicken salad sandwich is on point.  I'll definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Amazing cafe with the best coffee and delicious food. The coconut milk latte is my favorite and I've tried the avocado toast, chicken salad, and this hummus plate is so fantastic. I can't have hummus at most places because I can't have tahini. This tepary bean hummus doesn't have tahini and it tastes so good!!  The bread is so fresh and all the vegetables are so tasty!"}
{"text":"This was our first stop on our week long vacation in Arizona! My husband had the fresh avocado toast, simple, yet elevated, which was a wonderful welcome coming from Northern Wisconsin where the avocados aren't necessarily known for their freshness.  I had the goat cheese and jam toast, creamy with a hint of sweet. My large iced latt√© with a hint of hazelnut was spot on as was the green tea. Inner circle cafe is a must! I'm already trying to figure out when we can come back!!"}
{"text":"Nice people running this place, high quality food, amazing bread and coffee.  The chairs?  LOL, not used to them.  Happy to support a good local business that does it right!"}
{"text":"Great new coffee spot.  Friendly staff and good tasting coffee.  I will be back. 

No sign up yet.  Just to the left of the Mexican grill.  It's worth stopping in for."}
{"text":"Great coffee and awesome service. The owner, Sue, does an outstanding job of taking care of the customers.  I stop by here a couple of times a week for the tasty Lattes and Mochas."}
{"text":"I love this little local spot! I can't speak to most of the menu because I'm so in love with the avocado toast and goat cheese toast that I never order anything else! 

The space is cozy and great for studying or working. There's plenty of outlets for laptop and phone chargers as well. The owners are always very friendly and welcoming and they can sure make a delicious iced latte!"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST coffee place! I am addicted to the iced coffee, the mocha is fabulous as well, topped with house-made whipped cream!
There are plenty of outlets to plug into and the parking is ample. I have business meetings here weekly, it is the perfect spot! The food is great too. I've only had the toasts, but all are fabulous!
You need to check this place out for breakfast, lunch or any time in between!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place! Great ambiance, cleanliness, and smells. If you need to get some work done in a quiet peaceful place, this is the spot to come! 

Loved the \"Need a hug\". You can never get to many and it is wonderful to have that mentality! Spread love!"}
{"text":"First things first, they have the BEST coffee in the Phoenix/Tempe area!! Stumbled upon this cafe at the last minute and I couldn't have been more glad I did. The choices on the menu are simple yet great tasting. And lastly that hospitality!! 10/10 Thank you"}
{"text":"This new place in South Scottsdale is a winner in every regard! We were there for breakfast this morning on our first visit, and we got to meet the talented owners. Their early-on 5-star reviews are well deserved based on our experience today. 

Ellen had their beautifully presented avocado toast, a customer hit, with her favorite green tea. I had the brie plate with fresh fruits along with a perfect cafe mocha. We decided on a breakfast dessert of sorts after those winning dishes, ravishing a thick slice of poppyseed coffee cake in no time.  

As evidenced by this review so far, Inner Circle Cafe is a fine place to indulge in a way that's very hard to do at home. Opened in November, we just discovered the place on Yelp yesterday, spending little time in getting there! 

In addition to memorable food, the cafe is bright, colorful, well designed, with impressive, diverse, and affordable art for sale around the walls. 

Prices are very reasonable, and Inner Circle Cafe is just a happy place to be. We're going back soon for lunch. Maybe we'll see some of you there!"}
{"text":"Sue and Courtney are the light of my mornings! Such sweet women and such a great atmosphere. Um... the avocado toast with hard boiled eggs and cherry tomatoes... TO DIE FOR! Also a huge fan of the homemade chai. Sue's recipe is the best chai I've ever had. I just found out while ordering food that most everything is locally sourced, even their beans they make their hummus from! I'm in awe. Big props to you guys! My new spot for coffee/breakfast for sure."}
{"text":"We needed a quick breakfast in a pinch and found this place.  The reviews were great so we decided to stop by. My wife and I both ordered the Avocado toast with hard boiled egg on top and wow. Everything was super fresh and locally grown. My wife even stated \"I didn't realize I needed avocado until now\". 

The coffee was delicious and always topped off, they even offered me a to-go cup as we left. Service was outstanding and friendly. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"After a long night out, my friend and I stopped by this wonderful coffee shop on a holiday and the owner was incredibly friendly and opened the shop just for us. Great coffee, amazing service, and even greater owners."}
{"text":"Love the chai with expresso and the avocado, clean place the owner is very pleasant and easy to talk to. Will definitely be back. Very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM! Been in and out of town last few months for business and I have been to my fair share of coffee shops/cafes. ICC is now my choice to eat and drink a cup of joe while I get some work done. This place is nestled in an older shopping center with ample parking and quiet area in lower Scottsdale. Small shop but plenty of tables and seating. Local Owner is so nice and makes sure her customers are satisfied. Avocado toast is fire and coffee is great too! Support your local business and get away from the cookie cutter corporate shops. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. The woman at the counter was very helpful and friendly. My wife said it was the best whit mocha she's had in a while here in AZ."}
{"text":"The muffins were really good and the iced mocha was amazing!! There's not a ton of options but the prices are good and the options are healthy"}
{"text":"Cute place, good fresh food, and super clean and simple. Stop by this little store and you won't be disappointed. I had a goat cheese salad and my dad had a sandwich with a salad. Yum!"}
{"text":"Habanero Mocha is the (atomic) bomb. Avocado toast with egg is perfect. Don't miss inner circle when you're in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Love the coffee, it's my post yoga treat everyday! One of the cooler cafes in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Yes, great and fresh breakfast. Best of all it's not a chain so you get unique and affordable food. Will definitely come here again and invite others."}
{"text":"First time. Here great latte sweet not bitter. Best in town. Also ordered toast with Guacamole with boiled egg. Nice relaxing place."}
{"text":"This gem is our new favorite coffee and light breakfast in Scottsdale. The avocado toast is beautifully presented with watermelon radish garnish. Delicious! Sue is a gracious host. She made us feel so welcome. A great place to start the day! Jayne & Randy"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Coffee & pastries are delicious!  Sue the owner is super sweet!   Awesome coffee spot here in South Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"When we, 4 adults & 2 youngsters came into the highly ranked spot it looked promising. We ordered a couple of waters &  drinks along with avocado toast & a salad from their their menu.  We were the only patrons. 40 minutes later we had nothing on our table but the reflection of our sad hungry faces.  Finally, the items arrived along with the wrong salad.  Funnily we had  a toaster & avocado & bread at home. We make avocado & toast at home, usually takes 5 minutes."}
{"text":"You have to try the habanero mocha! This is a nice place to come read a book and slow down, or get cought up on work or school."}
{"text":"My first time going to Inner Circle Cafe was yesterday and I'll confess, I went back again today! The food was delicious! Yesterday I had the brie, granny apples, and jam on toast and today I had the avocado toast with boiled egg. My dad had the curry chicken in the stuffed avocado and I tried it- also amazing! Everything has been filling (yes, even the toast!) with great flavors and a beautiful presentation. The cafe is comfortable with these cool springy chairs. 
Go, you won't regret it. 
You'll probably see me there because I'm going to be a regular."}
{"text":"Great local spot, cozy and great for work or study. Good coffee AND good food! Finally a spot that's not another trendy copy of Cartel, but a homey spot to bring your kids or your laptop."}
{"text":"The vibe is peaceful and the service stellar.
Excellent crispy toast - not sure how she does it but this toast stays crispy & tasty no matter what you load onto it!
Locally sourced. Super fresh and simple flavors. Nicely priced for trying several items as you relax and chat.
Loved the Mexican coffee wth cinnamon/chocolate - better than dessert."}
{"text":"Yum. Simple. Quaint.

Good place to go for a cup and chill or talk to people who are there."}
{"text":"Hidden gem, healthy, fresh.   Avocado toast was excellent,   a whole avacado on it!   Excellent iced coffee, not bitter.    Going back for lunch."}
{"text":"Was looking for breakfast and stumbled upon this place on yelp and I'm glad I did! Lots of locally sourced ingredients and the coffee was great. I'm happy to have found a new place for a quick breakfast or lunch that is so close by."}
{"text":"Love this place! Stopped by to do some homework, great Environment for studying. Had a matcha latte it was delicious. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Great coffee & cafe items. Great vibe here, warm & friendly service. Recommend Mexican Chocolate Latte & avocado toast. Nice place to chill, alone or with friends."}
{"text":"This cafe is so welcoming, bright and a really great place to get work done or congregate with friends. Sue is so personable and her food is fantastic. Every dish she makes is meticulously crafted and gourmet. I am so happy I found my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This is a new place in my neighborhood, and I have been waiting for weeks for them to open.

You will find them in The Whilshire Plaza that house Atlas Bistro, AZ Wine and No Que No. Inner Circle is every bit of Cafe as any in town. The Coffee is serious and come to find out the owner founded Desert Grind and The Orange Table. 

Excellent Ice Tea, amazing Humus plate and The Very best Tuna Sandwich I have ever had in my life rounded out lunch.

They Promise an expanded menu soon, along with some grab and go, as well as several soups evry day.

For now it's a great lunch spot and even better for a delicious Caffeine fix."}
{"text":"Loved the Brie toast with apple!  Heading up that way again today to check out other food offerings.  The atmosphere is sweet - very calm and nicely quiet, conducive to long conversations over great coffee!"}
{"text":"The egg salad sandwich is the best! Such a great environment to hang out with friends and/or grab a bite to eat. Sue, the owner, is super awesome.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Friendly and chill vibe, playing a nice mix of 80\"s to now music. 7 chair/tables with a couch and stuffed chairs to spend time with your peeps. Inner Circle is on Scottsdale South of Thomas on the East side in the mall with Hot Yoga University and AZ wine, across from Pep Boys. We came in for a relaxing moment and coffee with my small people on a Friday late morning. Sue greets you with a warm smile and a menu. The menu hits all the highs with satisfying and tantalizing sandwiches and salads. See the yummy avocado toast I noshed on today. My kids enjoyed the nutella banana toast. The got on it pretty fast so no pic there. I appreciate supporting my friend and her dreams. Please do the same, you wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"Really great cafe. The coffee is fantastic, I had the Habanero mocha. And the food was so fresh and delicious. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a placed we picked only by chance.  But never will I come here by chance. I will come here because the place looks beautiful inside and outside.  The eating area is open and no mater where you sit you are surrounded by beautiful decoration.  But let me get to the food.  The food in this place is so good. It's is full of flavor and color and texture.  Maybe the owners are chefs, maybe they are gods of delicious food. Who knows?  But come and try this place because you will fall in love with everything from the fridge to the art."}
{"text":"I'd eat here everyday if I could! I look forward to their delicious, smooth coffee and the avocado toast that is made with crisp ingredients that have always been fresh and perfectly seasoned. I've only been 3 times, so there's many tempting items on the menu I can't wait to try! Oh and the service couldn't be friendlier. So grateful to my friend Lauren who found this place and glad it is so close to my new office."}
{"text":"The food was quite delicious, although it did take a significant amount of time to prepare a stuffed avocado and a hummus plate. This is one of those places that there's only one person working and they do everything: ring up your order, answer the phone, prep the food, clean. The woman was very nice and checked in quite a few times though which we appreciated."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place for brunch.
The food was so fresh, healthy. I had avocado toast with egg & the person I was with had an egg salad sandwich. Really good. Priced right. Latte was delicious too. 
And customer service was amazing.

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Avacado toast was amazing! Also had the Nutella and Banana toast with a Mocha and a White Chocolate Mocha. I went is vey sweet and nice. Well worth the visit. Great little cafe."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, their breakfast menu is limited. But the coffee makes up for it. It is tucked inside a mellow multi tenant retail strip which ensures plenty of parking.  They have a really unique lavender tea."}
{"text":"Greeted by the owner with a big friendly smile is always a great start to a wonderful cup of coffee! Thanks Sue, we'll be back again and again and again..."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot!  Delicious avocado toast & coffee was excellent!  Would come back again!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"I'm at Inner Circle Cafe every Sunday, as part of a writing critique group that meets there. The owners, Sue and Ethan, take great care of us each week. They've gotten to know us by name, and will greet us when we come in. They even know our usual orders. Oh, and the music they play is great. I often hear my favorite songs when I come in. We always feel welcome every time we're here. Inner Circle is definitely a great place for a meet-up. For all these reasons, I am happy to give them five stars. Inner Circle rocks!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place on the Nextdoor site and was anxious to try. We were big fans of the Orange Table (owner's previous endeavor) and we're already big fans of the Inner Circle. It's not too fancy, the people are fantastic, and the coffee is great. Everything is sourced locally (or as locally as possible) and prepared with tender-loving-care. My wife prefers non-dairy in her beverages and they have both Almond and Coconut to choose from! We'll be back! They don't have a big sign yet; look for the circles on the windows and the green VW Beetle out front."}
{"text":"The owner is very friendly and the cafe is super cute inside. She makes her own chai which is DELICIOUS- not too sweet and very gingery! Great coffee as well :) I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I just happened to stumble in this cuz it's by my yoga place.   It's a hidden gem!!!! Sooo glad I discovered it.     Very cozy vibe,  and amazingly friendly owners.  They even Have free WiFi and it's quiet so wonderful place to meet people and do some work. The lunch items were to die for, inexpensive and large portions. Order the avocado with egg  sandwich! And the bean hummus!!!   They also serve real Italian macchiato's!  Not like phony ones with chocolate."}
{"text":"Best quality breakfast I have had in a long time. I could smell the freshness of the avocado toast as it was served. Great iced coffee! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is simple, friendly yet gourmet. I love to support independently owned places. It literally felt like central perk from \"friends\". My roommate and I met there to catch up and it was absolutely perfect. 
The mojo chai was perfect! 
The owner checked on us a few times making sure everything was ok and asked what we thought. 
Love love love this place."}
{"text":"I love this new cafe in my 'hood! Lots of space - clean, open design. The food is seriously good and very reasonably priced. I can't wait to try literally everything. Sue, the owner, is friendly and accommodating. I work from home, and often hit up coffee shops to get out of the house and get some work done. I have a feeling this will become my new \"office\". If you're in the area please check it out - we need to support small businesses and we need more like this in south Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This has quickly become a favorite stop for black coffee right before yoga and a delicious bite to eat after yoga. I'm pretty simple when it comes to coffee so I just get an iced coffee(cold brew?)- Black, and it's soooo delicious. I've also tried the prickly pear green tea and that was also delicious. Food wise, the avocado toast was on point with fresh tomatoes, radishes, and a dash of chili powder. Just yesterday I tried the egg salad sandwich and haven't been able to stop thinking about it, I want more! There was horseradish mixed in it, yum!!! The owner is super sweet and makes me feel welcome. Will continue to frequent."}
{"text":"Sue is fantastic at what the does. 
I run a writers group here every Sunday and they've been more than accommodating and encouraging ever since we started a few months ago. 
And the food is fantastic! The bread served with the egg salad sandwich, for example, makes me wanna shoop! If you're looking for a local and cozy cafe, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for three days and had breakfast at Inner Circle Cafe everyday.  All of the toasts are delicious, on crusty bread with generous amounts of fresh toppings.  The fresh fruit included with each dish is a tasty way to start the day. Smooth medium roast coffee is topped up till you're jittering.  The owners are nice and friendly.  They are runners and mountain bikers and told me where to go trail running.  We will come back when we return to the area."}
{"text":"Very refreshing and tasty! The avocado toast makes it worth the trip. 4 shots of espresso in the cappuccino too!!!!"}
