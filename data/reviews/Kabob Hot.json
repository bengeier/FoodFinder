{"text":"We were HUGE fans of Jerusalem Cafe and so sad when it closed. If you were a fan too- be sad no more. Kabob Hot was amazing. We ordered lentil soup, a mixed grill, and their special of the day which was a Kafka with tomato sauce. Amazing taste and presentation. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I always like Middle Eastern food and I just tried Kabob Hot for the first time today. I can't stop thinking about how good it was. I ordered chicken shawarma that had this amazing pomegranate sauce on it and the owner brought me a little bit of a green bean appetizer he was making for dinner. It was garlicky and full of tomatoes- my 9 month old loved it as much as I did. I enjoyed lunch so much that I got the green beans to go for dinner. I'm already mentally planning my next visit and it's the good kind of stressful where my food was so great that I can't decide if I should order the same thing again or try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Went to Kabob Hot while visiting family outside of Charlotte for Christmas - it's fantastic! It's great to have an authentic Middle-Eastern restaurant option in the suburbs south of Charlotte. I ordered the shawarma, which was very flavorful and delicious (definitely unique spices I hadn't had before); we split the hummus appetizer as well and it was so good. I believe the man waiting tables is also the owner, and he was very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu and making recommendations. I will definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while visiting for the holidays. Really nice to have a good Mediterranean place out this way! Family had falafel, hummus, shawarma, and kabobs. Food was great (loved the rice with the kabobs) and owner was very friendly. The fresh orange juice with pomegranate should not be missed!"}
{"text":"Fantastic first visit. Husband and wife team, very authentic Middle Eastern food. Had the falafel and chicken shawarma, both fantastic and the presentation was great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not even worth a 1 star. Worst $65 I have ever spent on dinner. Only thing I was able to eat was the side salad. HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"Great food. Prices are decent but not as good of a deal as some other Mediterranean places."}
{"text":"Solid Middle Eastern food served fast and hot. Hummus with chicken shwarma rocks the house!"}
{"text":"New name, but not much else has changed.  We came for a late Friday lunch.  The fact there were no other patrons should have been a sign.  The interior feels too small because of how they closed in the kitchen though that is the same as it was under the old name.  

We really wanted to give them another chance as it was 1.5 years since our last attempt which was uninspired.  Unfortunately not much has changed.  The falafel tasted like it was heated from the freezer and had very little flavor.  My chicken shawarma wrap was ok, but there was nothing special about it.  

No real atmosphere, barely ok food, and a too small seating area.  We will drive the extra 10 minutes to kabab je the next time we want exceptional falafel and Middle Eastern food.  It's a shame because we live so close, but the food was just not good."}
{"text":"Yum! I stopped by here for lunch. I had the chicken schwarma and a side of mtabal. It was really delicious. I can't wait to go back. I only wish they had lunch specials."}
{"text":"Food was passable at best. Chicken dry and beef schwarma overcooked. Service was poor and tried to memorize order incorrectly."}
{"text":"We love their food! The babaganouj is amazing. We have been several times and never disappointed"}
{"text":"Ordered my first meal in this restaurant. A gentleman waited on me and very patiently taught me about the food on the menu! What a wonderful experience! My food was delicious! I will definitely return to try other choices on the menu. I am so happy I just stopped into Kabob Hot!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service.
Very caring and attentive owner. 
Must go eat at this Place .
All the items we ordered were fantastic.
The Tabouli salad was amazing and the falafel wrap was great.
A must must try"}
{"text":"We stopped in after a day at the pool.
I don't normally go looking for middle eastern food, but this was conveniently located across the street from the YMCA.
There was an abundance of flavor in everything that we ordered.
I opted for the sampler platter (any 4sides) since I'm inexperienced with Middle East cuisine, and asked the server to surprise me with the options.
Let's put it this way, I was not disappointed!
Aside from the humus it was all new to me, and all were tasty.
I will be stopping in again!"}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food in Charlotte. Consistently great food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Visited here for a late lunch after cycling - we were hoping that it had just been renamed but the Jerusalem menu was gone!

It's been replaced with a smaller menu of classic middle-eastern items, such as hummus, shawarma, and kababs. Missing now is the rich volume of salads that they had before, which is a shame.

We had falafel wraps, chicken shawarma, hummus plate and halloumi cheese. All were solid but the pita bread is no longer made locally, which is a bummer and impacts virtually all the dishes.

Service was brisk and prices are reasonable for the volume of food."}
{"text":"Please change back to Jerusalem Cafe. I ordered the falafel plate which consisted of 4 completely inedible hocky puck falefels, dry, stale pita, and flavorless hummus. I was really looking forward to this, but was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Kebab Hot. It is a great find!  The service and food are amazing. I highly recommend eating here if you like to try different cuisines like we do!  The meat was tender and the hummus was amazing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Two years ago I came to this Restaurant and it was called The Jerusalem Cafe, It has changed hands and is now Kabob Hot. The food is very authentic  Syrian - Middle Eastern and very good. We ordered a lot of appetizers to get the taste of everything. We had the Hummus with Cumin which was very smooth and creamy. We had the Fried Halloumi Cheese, fresh and beautifully presented . The Fried Cauliflower which was nice and lemony and hot and fresh. And the Fried Potato chips. All of those appetizers were good and they were served with some very thin, pita bread wrapped in plastic wrap, this is where they  lost the other star. There should be freshly made pita, which some of the competition makes. Serving that thin dried bread took away from the awesomeness of the good appetizers.  For Dessert we had Syrian  Bakdash Ice Cream, which is a middle eastern type of Ice cream made without eggs and flavored with Rose Water and it's pounded with large wooden mallets and then pulled and stretched, owing its taffy-like consistency to an ingredient called mastic gum. Covered with ground Pistachios and sitting on a thin anise flavored cookie, it was really good. Sitting in the middle of a strip mall it is a welcome place to eat when you want authentic ethnic!"}
{"text":"Wow is the best way to describe this new Resteraunt. Across from sisky y. I don't give 5 stars at all but this place is worth it. 
I had the special recommended by the owner . Beans in a tomato beef stew with rice. Beef was tender taste was very different with nice Mediterranean spices. It was great."}
{"text":"Come in once a week on my commute home to pick up chicken kabobs for the wife and I after work.  Folks are very nice and the food is consistently excellent.  The spice is very good and authentic compared to some of the other more bland Mediterranean spots in the area.  Really surprised the place isn't more crowded, people are really missing out."}
{"text":"Three of us stopped for lunch and were very happy with everything we ordered. The cauliflower appetizer was especially delicious and the baba ghanouj was also excellent. My husband was very pleased with his beef kebob. Fast pleasant service. It was a beautiful day so we were able to eat outside. If not the inside is a little small and cafeteria like so it might be 4 1/2 stars for that. However we will definitely be back often."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! We love to order all the different starters and salads for takeout, and the biggest challenge every time is to select amongst all the great choice!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean restaurants in NC, if not the best, one world to describe the food \"Authentic\" ... and on top of that, service is fantastic. Every foodie should try this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service, would come again if I am in town for sure.
Don't forget the desert."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service.  The best kafta kabobs I've ever had. Very friendly and attentive staff.  Prices are reasonable and the portion size is quite generous.  Will definitely return as there is much more I would like to try."}
{"text":"We love coming here! The owner is always there, with a smile and great suggestions. We absolutely love the Hummus with cumin and the Chicken shawarma wraps. Everything is so tasty!"}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding middle eastern cuisine!  The signature dish that I had today is the Baba Ghanouj, they have amazing grape leaves, hummus and the list goes on and on. I am semi vegetarian but my children and husband love the meat dishes here as well. The owners are wonderful and I love eating here. It is a must have."}
{"text":"Stopped in at 8pm (hour before close), ordered beef shawarma, chicken shawarma, hummus, dolmades, all to go.

The hummus was great, best thing we got.  The bread was a little hard, wrapped in little baggies and not freshly steamed as other places do it.  The chicken shawarma had dry little grilled chunks of chicken and a wierd sweet pomegranate sauce.  The beef shawarma was okay but somewhat dry as well.  When ordering I requested \"no onions\" 3 times, he even repeated it back to me.  Got home, had onions.  The dolmades (rice stuffed grape leaves) were good but likely out of a can.  

Atmosphere, small and awkward.  Very closed in, no way to see any employees to flag them down.

I wholeheartedly love supporting local businesses like this, especially ethnic restaurants (who needs another McDonald's right?), but overall it was just disappointing considering other similar options in the area.

For the money, just go to Zetouni's, Kebab Je, or even Athenian Grill."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful Syrian and Mediterranean restaurant. If want authentic ...(close your eyes and you're in Syria flavor) look no further. I have been to most of the Mediterranean restaurants in the Charlotte area and this one is the best. I highly recommend the hummus with cumin as an appetizer, then for the meal a chicken kabob with grape leaves and the very special  \"mnazale zahra soup\" with the rice and lemon. Excellent dinner for two. The atmosphere is nice and its never too busy. The music played is in the style and appropriate for the meals served. Service is excellent. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very good based on our first experience at this new restaurant. Lamb kafka was very very good as well as the lentil soup, chicken kabobs and lamb kebabs. All meat was very well cooked and seasoned really really well. Definitely will Hobbs k many times."}
{"text":"My family loves coming in for the entire experience! The owner is always present & always friendly. The chicken kabobs are always moist and full of flavor. 

I've never had a bad experience and would recommend this to anyone looking for authentic Middle Eastern cuisine. The food has been consistently delicious"}
{"text":"This place is very mediocre and way overpriced for what it is. I'm posting this because we read the other reviews and had high hopes, but it's just not good. We went in with an open mind, but the hummus is no better than a container of Sabre, the baba ghanoush was unrecognizable, chunky, and sour (why?), and the pita seemed like it was bought at the grocery store. My combo platter of four sides, plus an appetizer of hummus, was about $20... And I've had as good from chain restaurants. I've even made my own hummus that was better. Plus, while I'd be willing to overlook the bland ambiance, it's hard not to feel ripped off when the food is bad and the atmosphere is like a discount Chinese restaurant. There are a lot of great places in this area. Go there instead."}
{"text":"ok food denise b amore? stop posting about restaurant 136 review stop eating out stay in waxhaw please we dont care where you go out"}
{"text":"Excellent Middle Eastern food!  The service was prompt and very welcoming.  The grape leaves, hummus and pitas were very fresh and delicious. The beef, lamb and chicken were all cooked perfectly and had that great combination of charred and tender.  Nicely subtle seasonings and we also got a great hot sauce on the side.  Great addition to the area!"}
