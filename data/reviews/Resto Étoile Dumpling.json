{"text":"Ordered with Foodora, 35$ for two portions of dumplings and we didn't even get chopsticks or soy sauce. Thick and chewy, won't order again."}
{"text":"Decent dumplings and a range of flavours! They could be served a little hotter but were otherwise great. Servers there were extremely patient with the toddlers at our table who wanted to wander.  The resto is close to our home and definitely makes the list as a dinner option!"}
{"text":"Amazing dumplings, highly recommended for both dining in and take-out. Great options for vegetarians as well. I recommend getting them pan fried."}
{"text":"This is a strange, strange place. That being said, it's a mom'n'pop that's thoroughly deserving of your love and patronage.  The good: - Fills a niche for Chinese dumplings et al in this neighbourhood - Reasonably good dumplings, reasonable prices  The okay: - Wrappers on the dumplings are a little heavy and chewy than I prefer - I was there on a Sunday night so it was pretty quiet, maybe about 6 covers while I was there. With only one person working the floor, she seemed a bit frazzled, albeit friendly.  The meh: - Cucumber salad came without nearly enough heat, and too much sugar. Oh well. - Lack of proper chili oil at the tables. They seemed to have a certain Chinese BBQ oil in its stead, which really didn't cut it  The odd: - The decor. Even with what I expect from 'hole in the wall' Chinese restaurants, which I adore when the food is good and has minimal health code violations (such parties will remain unnamed here), this is most decidedly a strange space. It's massive cavernous space. They seem to have a bar adorned with lights and vinyl records attached to the side, but seemed to be more for folding linens at the time. Certain corners of the restaurant were too dark to even read a menu, much to the dismay of some of the patrons who had to break out their cell phones to provide enough light. And last but not least, the \"stage\" whose picture you can see above. There's a sign up sheet that *anyone* can sign up for, a sound system + karaoke + keyboard, just in case you need to get your inner-Christina Aguilera out. Thankfully no one was singing at the time, but I'm morbidly curious what it would be like if someone had been. Also, noticed the fat screen TV blaring out b-ball as well as the security camera just above the stage. Weird. - At one point in the meal, a woman came out of the kitchen and started skyping with her cell phone, and showing the dining room to the caller, while we were eating. Funny, unnerving, but yet adorable.  It's certainly an experience I won't forget. I'd actually be happy to go back if I were in the neighbourhood, after gaining the requisite amount of mental fortitude."}
{"text":"Truly great dumplings! Five stars even though service could have been better. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Loved it. So glad we have a dumpling place here in NDG. All my favorites were there. Coriander and lamb, pork and leek. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few months ago for a late night dinner after a long day at work. The restaurant was empty (yes no servers as well) although it was another hour before they close. The person who finally came to \"the reception desk\" and served me couldn't care less about introducing their menu and taking my order. I got steamed seafood and vegetable dumplings and steamed pork dumplings: dry, flavourless and unpleasant overall. I tried two pieces, waited for about 10 minutes to see the waiter to waive at him and ask for the bill, payed and left. Would never go back. What an experience for a \"dumpling\" place!"}
{"text":"Delicious dumplings.  Finally a good dumpling place close to home.  Don't have to go all the way downtown.  Dumplings are so good, full of soup when you bite into them.  They even made chicken and coriander for me because it wasn't that busy when I was there.  I hope they stay around for a long time.  You get a good portion for your money."}
