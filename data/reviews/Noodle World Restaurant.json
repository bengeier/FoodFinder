{"text":"When I go to noodle world, I only have three things on my mind:

1) canh chua ca/ canh chua tom, hot and sour soup with pineapples, and fish or shrimp
2) ca kho to, sauteed fish in clay pot
3) com ga xao do, red fried rice with chicken
just writing that makes my mouth water. The canh chua ca used to be made with a different type of fish, but the recent recipe is still delicious. Very fragrant, strong hot and sour broth flavour. An abundance of fish, pineapples, tomatoes, and bean sprouts. The fish comes sizzling hot in the clay oven, and is always well seasoned. The tenderness of the fish, and the sauce are two things I could eat over plain rice every day. 

The red fried rice with chicken is something that I only associated with noodle world. I like adding some hoisin sauce to my rice, give that a shot next time for some extra flavour (not that it's lacking any LOL). 

Well priced. If you're going with a group of two or four and want to try dishes (1) and (2), i recommend ordering the set meal for two or four."}
{"text":"Pho noodle was good.  Service was ok. We asked for hot coffee and they gave us iced coffee, but they fixed it right away."}
{"text":"Great tasting and very large portions! Good price and friendly service. More of a lunch stop but still worthwhile to try. I had the 38 and could only finish half my boyfriend had an XL 10 soup same thing he could not get it all down."}
{"text":"The Gioi aka Noodle World Vietnamese Restaurant. This is the place I hit it up when I *DON'T* want to eat pho. Sometimes it's more than Pho, it's all about the Vietnamese cuisine.

When I'm in the mood to eat rice dishes or vermicelli dishes this is the place I goto for those kinds of items. I really like their Com Bo Nuong Tao Hu Ky aka Rice with Beef and Bean Curd (I think lol.).

I'm also a fan of their Hieu Tieu dishes as well, the glass noodle kind, mostly seafood and usually very delicious to eat. 

I'll also add to the items I eat here is Bo Luc Lac with Macaroni. I know, simple dish right? Beef cubes and Macaroni --- but I love it! I'm a pretty simple fellow myself.

Cafe Suda Da aka Iced Vietnamese Coffee is something I usually order from here as well.

Service is usually very good, walk in - seated and within 5 minutes of sitting the order is taken and although it may take a few minutes extra for your food the restaurant itself is decent looking enough to enjoy sitting there twiddling your thumbs a little extra, not too much extra or I'm going to re-write this part of my review.

Staff are friendly, english is average but good enough for people who work in a Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, this is the first time I come to this place, which is on a Saturday. The noodles taste good and the meat cut just right."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty Vietnamese pork chop rice dish.  Flavourful and chop was moist and not at all dry.  Fried tofu wrap was interesting also.
Ketchup macaroni and beef was very kid friendly.  Teenager wolfed it down. 
Vermicelli with pork chop, shrimp and bean curd was rated excellent.
The only average dish was the chicken stir fry.  It was meh.
Atmosphere clean and typical Asian no frills decor.
Will be back to try the pho for the true test of the restaurants worth."}
{"text":"Restaurant ambient is ok, some uplift reno is needed. Food was pretty good depending on which dish you are ordering, quite a big portions, we ordered # 22, House Special noodle, generous portion with meat & seafoods. Our Pork rolls were refrigerator temperature, Yikes! Service was quite fast. Overall is ok."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is just memories.

First off, service is average. Sometimes you get the grumpy waitress and sometimes you get a blank waitress. Their service is fast though and you get your food almost instantly. 

My favorite food there are the quails. Oh what delight!! Their menus are extensive, my fiancee drinks a lot of their bubble teas. And I often get the broken rice special that has a lot of stuff on it. Their portions are good bordering a lot and I really like that. It's a good balance of meat, carbs, and veggies.

The flavour of the food is often good, though sometimes I feel that their maccaroni beef steaks are a bit too oily.

I like their pop refrigerator it is super cute! It always makes me buy their Coke there!

The setting of the place is mediocre, it's not really meant to look good. The fish aquarium is kind of moldy but that's a part of its charm.

The seating tends to be uncomfortable if you stay on one spot for too long but other than that the place is pretty medium. Though one note, they did play Christmas music till February last year and it annoyed me because there was an onslaught of repetitive Christmas music.

Because of the grumpy service and corny music, I give this place a 4/5.

And yes I would recommend you to try pho here."}
{"text":"The service is not really too good. We felt like we were unwanted. The food is actually quite good, so that made up for the bad service. Everything is really overpriced!! Caf√© sua da is $4.50. Soda lemonade is $4.50. There is absolutely no way those drinks should be valued that high in that neighborhood. It's just highway robbery. I would only go back if there was nothing else to eat in the area."}
{"text":"They also have a vegetarian menu that's written on a board on top of the fish tank. You can also just ask the server. We tried the Vegetarian Bun Rieu and we both enjoyed it very much. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Food 5/5 the food here is phenomenal . I love the sweet & sour soup & caramelized fish! Very authentic. 

Service 4/5 service is good but servers don't speak a whole lot of English. 

Environment 3/5 place is clean , the bathrooms could use a little bit of TLC

Parking 4/5 depending on when you go there will be lots of parking but there is another restaurant there and sometimes the parking lot can be full."}
{"text":"my last review was in 2012, and towards end of 2014 my review still stands. I had a craving for Pho last week and I went to Pho Xuan in 36th  st. NE, the next day I have to go to noodle world to satisfy the craving...coz the other place didnt cut it. Even my doggie didnt like the spring rolls I brought home from Pho Xuan. I hope they NEVER close! family owned, very friendly. yah, the paint is pink....not a biggie, the food is awesome! serving is more than enough!"}
