{"text":"When I worked near Manrijangsung, I really enjoyed coming here for lunch. So when my sister and I had a failed attempt to dine at Anju before they closed for renovations, our hankering for Korean lead us here.

Not gonna lie, this place isn't situated in the best part of town (right by the infamous sketchy Mac's on 8th St) but it was still light out so I wasn't too concerned.

This place is pretty small, maybe about 8 tables are squished inside. The nice thing is that they have tall wall dividers segregating the tables so you have some privacy.

We skimmed the menu (they have both Korean and Chinese options) and ordered the glass noodles with black bean sauce and the spicy tofu hot pot. The black bean sauce was a nice combo of sweet and salty and although very flavorful, the spicy tofu hot pot was too spicy. We ended up ordering sides of rice to subside the fire in our mouths.

For the both of us to be super full it cost us just over $20 - pretty sweet deal for some tasty Korean food!"}
{"text":"I've never heard of Manrijangsung before and I never knew where it was and so it took a bit of looking to actually find the place. It's almost on the corner of 7th avenue and 9th street so the best parking is if you can find parking on 9th street somewhere close to 7th ave. This part of downtown is pretty sketchy so I don't know how comfortable some people would be finding this restaurant to eat at.

I had just finished having a few beers at Joey's to celebrate an awesome day for me and decided why not go have some Korean. Initially our intention was to have some of their chicken wings which I've heard is great - however, they don't have it on the menu anymore which kind of sucked.

Manrijangsung is a small restaurant, there are a few tables - to me, nothing inside screams authentic but at the same time I'm not sure what I would expect a Korean restaurant to look like inside either.

We ordered this combination of food items like the bbq pork belly which was sliced fairly thick and tasted great I mean I am not a korean connoisseur of any sort. Paired up with an sliced ring of onion and a jalapeno my taste buds said fabulous. We also ordered this egg pancake thing which was good as well.

Separately we ordered two bowls of rice and also got a bottle of soju with our meal which was nice. There's nothing like eating Korean food while shooting down an ounce or two of soju right?

I really didn't mind Manrijangsung although it would help if our server who was cute understood and spoke english better in my opinion. The food wasn't bad at all but I definitely have had a lot more delicious Korean in the city. 

If I am in the area I don't mind coming back here."}
{"text":"Manrijangsung is a Korean and Chinese restaurant, and although the food was decent, I've definitely had way better Korean food elsewhere (hence the YELP rating of 2.5). 

It is a small little place along the c-train line with an unusual Asian decor. There is pink/red wallpaper, a giant mural of the Great Wall of China, lanterns and pictures of food from the menu plastered on the wall. There are small tables set up around the restaurant with some areas sectioned off for privacy. 

I came here with a group of friends for dinner and we mostly ordered Korean food. The menu consisted of stir fries, stews and soup, deep fried foods, korean bbq meat, and chinese noodle/rice dishes. A huge variety with prices ranging from to $10-$15 for small to medium dishes and $20-$25 for larger dishes to share. A tad pricey compared to other places, but they do have some deals such as getting soju/3 beers plus a selected dish from the menu for $35 (feeds 2 people), and 10% off on the menu on Wednesdays.

We decided to try the Marinated Short Ribs (kalbi - $13.99); Seafood pancake (haemul pajeon - $16), korean BBQ with thin sliced pork (Dape samgyup - $28); pollock roe stew with onions, radish, pepper and crown daisy (al tang -$19); and tempura deep fried shrimp and sweet potato ($13).  

I enjoyed the short ribs since they very sweet with a smokey BBQ flavor. The Korean BBQ with sliced pork was nothing special. It was just like cooking and eating thinly sliced bacon. For what you're paying though, this dish is not worth getting.

The seafood pancake had a soft mushy center, crisp exterior, and was full of seafood. It was a little bland though. My favourite dish out of the whole evening was the pollock soup. The broth had the right amount of spice that the menu had stated and was full of flavour. Although, the portion of fish and tofu was decent, the fish was overcooked that it became unappetizing.

Although, the rest of the menu looks interesting, the price and dinner experience makes Manrijangsung not worth my taste buds."}
{"text":"One of the best late night Korean restaurants in Calgary. They have everything from beer & soju to gamjatang and soondae lol. The owner served us and was so friendly and welcoming. She made sure to check up on us often to see if we needed anything. Their gamjatang on stove was delicious. They have a lunch menu for it too but the \"on stove\" is constantly hot and tastes a lot more fresh."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on a weekday to try this place out.  They have lunch specials at fairly decent prices for downtown (~$10-13), I ordered a beef short rib.
The short ribs came with a gigantic portion of rice, one spring roll and some salad.  We were also provided with some banchan (kimchi, pickled radish, mashed potato ball) and a bowl of miso soup (tasted more like some kind of light fishy broth).  The short ribs were nice and flavorful, there was way too much rice for the amount of banchan/meat.  Service wasn't good though because there was only one person working front of house and one chef.  It took a while for us to get our orders in and to get our bill."}
{"text":"I am very confused why this place has such a low rating - it's wonderful! It should say something that my table was the only one without Koreans and when we left, there was a line outside the door. 

I would say that this place probably suffers from the same problem that Don Day does...it is filled with a thin of grease (because of the hot pot/BBQ) and the menu is not very accessible if you're not Korean or not familiar with Korean food. Also, the place is pretty small and dingy and if you're a vegetarian it's impossible to get away from the smell of cooking meat. 

All of that being said, I really enjoyed Manrijangsung and I thought it was excellent Korean BBQ. I don't think this is the sort of place where I would go to get Bibimbop or Bulgogi but this is a great place to have really good soups or BBQ. The meat is delicious and well seasoned and the soups are hearty and full of spice. 

If you like Korean BBQ you will like this place. If you have never tried Korean food (or all you know is spicy pork) then this isn't the place for you. I have had Korean BBQ before numerous times and I still l was happy my friend ordered for us the entire time. So if you want to be adventurous or you miss South Korean flavor then definitely put this place on your \"to try\" list. Just don't wear clothes that you won't mind washing when you get home."}
{"text":"Last time I visited Manrijansung was with my friend and we both decided to order Tangsuyuk and jajangmyeon as the restaurant is a chinese (Korean version) restaurant. They also offer non chinese-korean dishes, so in case you are looking for kalbi or bulgogi they also offer those dishes.

The atmosphere of the restaurant wasn't too bad, but it felt a bit stuffy and dusty.  The walls definitely needed a nice scrubbing when we went to visit.

Also, there is a button on your table that you can push to have a server come to your table. This is quite common in Korea and some other Korean restaurants and Karaoke bars in Calgary have it too.

As for the food, the Tangsuyuk was not too bad, but I prefer Korean Village's Tangsuyuk better. Also their jajangmyeon wasn't too bad as well, a bit runny, but not too bad.

Overall, I probably would come and have lunch there again if my friends wanted to. And if we were already downtown and nearby. But I wouldn't drive down and spend parking to have lunch in Manrijansung."}
