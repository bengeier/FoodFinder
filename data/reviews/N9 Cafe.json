{"text":"SCARY!!!  The food was either so bad or their food safety was in so much question that I only finished 1/3 of my order.  Among the worst places we have ever dined.

I believe the actual name is No9 (as in #9), but the \"o\" is tiny on their signage.

OVERALL
They don't know how to keep hot food hot and cold food cold.  Food tasted bland not subtle.  Their cuteness is not enough to offset feeling robbed by not being able to eat or regretting eating the food I paid above-average prices for.

HOURS
Why doesn't a cafe have morning hours?  Open Noon weekdays and 2pm weekends.

AMBIANCE
Besides the Santa doll that greeted us at the entrance in April, the first thing we noticed in the cafe was the vile, swampy, overwhelming perm solution smell from the salon next door.  We think the open door the washroom in back might be a shared area between businesses?

Most of the restaurant has black granite tables and black leather, ornate chairs.  One lacquered tree stump table by the front window.  White walls.  It's all downhill from here.  A huge post obstructs the centre of the restaurant.  Cob webs in their Provencale crystal chandelier.  A dusty faux fireplace.  A little shelf of disarrayed Korean board games and a stand of tousled magazines.  The Dollar Store Christmas decorations taped on walls and windows clash with decor and hint at the lack of attention to detail.  

Behind the counter is filthy, dusty, and disorganized.  It looked like a shed where gardening supplies would be kept ---- not a professional foodservice operation.

DRINK
Reviews and their FB website caught our attention because of the creative, unusual beverages:  Raining Coffee where cotton candy is clipped to a stand and starts to melt over a cup of coffee and a white robot w/ red heart marshmallow floating on coffee.  I thought, how can anyone mess up coffee or tea THAT badly?  Well, they did.
They only offer whole milk.  No sweeteners offered at the table, so drinks get cold waiting for the overwhelmed, lone server/cashier.  
Their beautifully layered, Black Sesame Latte had flavour potential, but they did not heat the glass mug and only heated the milk to just above luke warm.
We were afraid we were going to get food poisoning from their cold Pudding Milk Tea.  The cute, long spoon w/ a smiley face on it had dried food bits like it had not been cleaned.  So we wondered if they cleaned the glass milk bottle it was served in.  The pudding seems to be made with packaged custard mix with a bit of old nutmeg --- which we think gave it the \"I can't put my finger on it\" curious flavour.  
They have options for Kung Fu Tea that are served in playful tea sets that have fun 3-D characters.  The clips that hold the cotton candy did not look clean or something that should be used in commercial foodservice.  

FOOD
There are next to no English descriptions of food items, but there is Korean.
The Milles Crepes Cakes are edible.  Not subtle...but bland.  I swear their squishy strawberry crepes are made with a hint of Strawberry Quik mix.  Tiny smears of whipped cream between each layer and only one thin layer of shaved strawberries (probably only 1/2 of one strawberry per serving!).  Topped with half of a REALLY old shrivled strawberry half.  Bleck!

The Sakura mousse cake was beautiful, but inedible.  Sakura are Japanese cherry blossoms; there was one salty, brined edible flower place in the center of a thick layer of clear, almost unflavoured gelatin atop the mousse cake.  A few layers of broken strawberry mousse sandwiched between boring, dry yellow sponge cake.  The mousse had a tinge of acidity, but was near flavourless.  After 1.5 bites, I gave up eating it.

Ham crepe was over-cooked and cracked from being folded.  Filled with the tiniest amount of grated white cheese (cheddar?), smeared with an egg and a few baby spinach leaves.  Somewhat edible.  For goodness sake, they specialize in crepes and can't get it right!  Baby greens salad is withered and topped with a overly heavy drizzle of out-of-place, thick, Japanese mayo and 3 halved grape tomatoes; INEDIBLE.

The oddly-named Waffle Burger are quarter waffles that sandwich a slice of ham with 1/2 teaspoon of cheese.  They went overboard with the mayo on the withered salad and on top/inside the waffle.  I had to scrape off all the mayo and not eat the dried out cold ham, but the waffles alone were okay.  One over-cooked sunnyside up egg off to the side like the menu states, but not two eggs like their website depicts.  No salt offered for the egg, but ketchup pile resting against it and both entrees were dusted with an insane amount of black pepper.

SERVICE
Greeted promptly.  Dessert brought before entrees.  Entrees brought several minutes apart. Did not even return to notice that most of the food was not eaten.  Had to chase her down to pay. 

PAYMENT
Cash or debit only.

PARKING
Yonge St. meter parking.

Great, creative ideas, but execution is soooo awful."}
{"text":"Decent crepe cakes, obviously not as good as Lady M but still pretty good for Toronto standard. The waitress and the owner (?) were very friendly and the seats were comfy, overall a nice dessert place."}
{"text":"N9 was close to me and it had good reviews on Yelp so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the green tea mille crepe and a rose tea latte. I believed that these were more distinct items from their menu. If you like matcha and red bean, definitely try the mille crepe (warning: it's a little bitter) and the texture is amazing. Next, onto the latte, the rose latte just tastes like a normal latte with a few sprinkles of rose petals but it was quiet pricy, cost: $5. The service was alright, they asked me if I was ready to order 3 times within 5 minutes which was a little annoying. One of the waiters are extremely cute! Finally, there isn't much people hence its not that big. The restaurant is located in a small road off of Yonge. Will I come back? Not if I had another choice, I definitely prefer Pastel more than N9. Overall it's okay, and I would've give 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. ordered a brown sugar latte and green tea crepes cake. didnt expect much but the latte was surprisingly satisfactory. the cake was so-so quality but i see people keep coming in to get all the cakes they want. good for some chilling time but i wont it a cozy place for a longer hangout. polite servers and not noisy. they provide a few games like card games and jenga."}
{"text":"The mille crepes tastes very bad, cream is not creamy and the crepes are loose and puffy... Ugh... if Lady M is the score of 10 then this place is 4. We ordered two lattes and after 40 minutes I asked if the coffees are ready, the answer was we haven't made it, we left and didnt even have ice water served. The ambience is also not comfortable, cold and not that clean.. I WILL NEVER GO AGAIN."}
{"text":"This place has decent food but slightly pricy, which would have been fine if service wasn't so retarded. I walked in with my husband, waited a few minutes, nobody greeted us so we sat down at a 4 person table. Then the waitress came over and asked us to switch to a smaller table. I looked around the store, plenty of table for four was occupied by two people. Whatever, we ordered two drinks and two slices of cake, after one drink and two slices arrive, I waited another 40 min and didn't receive my specialty coffee. I asked them after 25 min in about my drink, they told me its on the way and it takes a while to make. By the time I said forget this, I am leaving, we been sitting for 30 min with nothing in front of us- everything's done. Only then they said, well, our machine for coffee is broken, we are waiting for someone to come to fix it. Are you kidding me? Why didn't you ask me to re- select a drink when you first noticed your machine broke down? Or tell me that when I inquired about my drink half in? We just sat there and wasted time because I thought my drink was coming . So unprofessional."}
{"text":"Ordered mango Mille crepe, the taste is just ok, nothing special, won't go back again."}
{"text":"This place is nicely decorated. We had green tea, chestnut and durian Mille crepes. They were decent, nothing out of ordinary though. I've had fluffier lighter Mille crepes before. The chestnut one tasted very bland, needed more chestnut in it. Their original milk tea was very sweet and thick to me, but tasted good, had a hint of rose in it.

I've heard many compliments and seen ad about this place before, but seems like it is just a mediocre place. Like other reviews stated, they are a bit pricy for the quality."}
{"text":"Literally all for the photos. The setting was lame - not much decor or theme just regular glass tables and chairs. The only more scenic spot was these two huge chairs with the tiniest wooden stump table (we had to move out from there when the waiter advised us that the food/drinks we ordered wouldn't fit on there LOL). 

We each ordered a combo which was very decently priced - 16 dollars for ANY drink, savoury or sweet crepe, and a crepe cake! We both ordered flavoured lattes, rose and taro, and I have never been more disappointed latte-wise. It was lukewarm and tasted like diluted coffee with zero rose or taro flavour. I got the mushroom crepe, and it was actually pretty yummy but not outstanding you know? It was weirdly HUGE in size, like literally put two hands finger tips to finger tips. LOL The crepe cake was what they are known for so the matcha one was really flavourful and creamy. But it was served FIRST before the crepes? It was awkward because me and my friend both ordered crepes...but literally, mine came 15 minutes after. Lastly, we got the infamous cotton candy coffee as seen on IG. The person who set it up for us set the cotton candy way too low so it touched the coffee. We had to fix it for the photos. It was really pretty when the cotton candy melted like raindrops into the coffee. But honestly, literally cotton candy on top of black coffee. 

Wouldnt come back because I have the IG worthy photos now. Here is one of them LOL."}
{"text":"I went there for the crepe cake. Do not expect the crepe cake is as good as lady M. There are lot more improvement needs to be made. The crepe layers are thick. Also when you cut the cake, it just collapsed and went apart.

However, the flavour is quite balance. 

Make sure you go early coz   i went at 4PM in the afternoon, green tea flavour is all gone and orginal flavour has only one piece left.

My frd order their toast, which is pretty good. I love it becasue it is not too sweet."}
{"text":"I came here for the mille crepe and cheese cake. Cheese cake is ok (so-so) , mille crepe is good, the texture is very smooth. Recommend the rose tea!"}
{"text":"Bad overall. They served us the wrong order, they didn't apologize but they exchange the order for us. Then i found a piece of hair in my drink, again, they didnt apologize. In fact, they blamed it on us and said that the hair was probably from us. The original milk tea and taro latte weren't good, it was tasteless and over priced. The honey toast looked very nice but the bread was very dry and burnt. I wouldn't go back and I don't recommend this cafe."}
{"text":"The cakes we ordered were Sakura cake and green tea crepe cake. Both are not bad but does not give me any special impression. The drink we got rose latte and green tea latte. For rose latte, they use real rose buds. You only can breath the aroma from the rose. Just like aroma therapy. After you drink it, the aroma stays in your mouth. I definitely will order this drink again. But for green tea latte, again not really impressive. 
The interior does not get proper design and some furniture get placed in some awkward places. A lot of spaces got wasted! They should hire an interior designer to make it better instead of a decorator."}
{"text":"I came in solely because of the raindrop coffee - genius idea with the marshmallow rain cloud \"raining\" (and sweetening) your coffee! It would be even better if the marshmallow at the end of the wooden stick was a marshmallow so you can eat it as well (or put it into your coffee). 

We ordered mango and chocolate mille cakes as well as the green tea and red bean  crêpes. The mille cakes weren't that great to be honest...they were too creamy for my taste, had mushy textures and had very artificial flavours. The chocolate mille cake barely tasted like chocolate at all - I tasted mostly cream. On the other hand, the crêpes tastes better than the cakes. It was very nicely presented and I highly recommend it for sharing. 

Overall, N9 was good. The desserts as a whole were comparable to a lot of other Asian dessert cafés. I would recommend coming here to try out the raindrop coffee as it is certainly something to experience!"}
{"text":"So I'm back with friends!

It's too bad their service is a bit slow for a quiet night. Mind you, I think it depends on which night you come. Some servers are more attentive than others.

I've recently had this fascination with Mille crepes mainly because of the labour and perfection involved. I like the lightness of the crepe to the proportion of cream. It's also not too sweet. 

The Millie crepes that I've tried so far;
- strawberry - could use a little more strawberry flavour
- green tea with red bean - my second fave!
- mango - good but I think it could have a bit more mango punch
- rainbow - very pretty!!! Vanilla creme flavour
- rose - could use a bit more rose, but not too much to the point that it taste like soap
- durian - my fave!!!

I was also hoping to try the brick toast, but they ran out. I was a bit disappointed. Hopefully I'll get to try it next time.

I would like to give this place a higher rating but service was so-so."}
{"text":"Not sure why the rating for this place was so low; my friends and I had a pretty good time when we visited this past Sunday! Food and drinks are super cute, service is distracted but quick once you get the waitress's attention, and the space itself is cozy and perfect for hanging out with friends.

We ordered a variety of drinks and desserts, my personal favourites being the raindrop coffee and the strawberry mille crêpe. I loved the cute concept of the cotton candy melting as \"raindrops\" into the coffee and I was surprised to find that the coffee tasted quite good as well - style AND substance! I thought the mille crêpe was on par with the cakes from Millie Creperie and I enjoyed it much more than the sakura mousse cake. The mousse cake looked very pretty but I was disappointed to find that it was a little flavourless. I also had a sip of the marshmallow coffee and the black sesame latte; the coffee tasted a little strange with the marshmallow (definitely not as good as the raindrop coffee) but the latte was pretty good - very smooth and creamy, although it could have had a stronger black sesame flavour.

I'm glad I went with a group of people because I got to sample several different drinks and desserts, but even so, there is still so much of the menu left to try! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Walk all the way there, and they weren't even open. It wasn't even 9:00 on a wednesday, and theyre apparently open till 11pm. Looks like you lost my business."}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty underrated. The interior is nice. The location is a bit hidden not exactly on Yonge street. However, that's what make it a hidden jewel- a great place to study because it's quiet and not a lot of people come. Their food is good too- very cute Baymax Drink. Their cake was good didn't feel very heavy with the crepe between each sheet of crepe (Millie crepe)

In terms of service- you just choose off of the menu at he front counter and then pay there. They will bring the food to you (quite of a do it yourself type of restaurant)"}
{"text":"Came here only for takeout on a Sunday afternoon.  The place was empty which is never a good sign.  I ordered the chestnut mille crepe.  The slice is rather small for the price.  In my opinion it is way too expensive.  The cake itself was pretty tasteless.  I couldn't taste any chestnut flavor but just whip cream taste.  Would probably not come back for the price."}
{"text":"Small shop dessert shop. Good place to study or read. The place is really quite. Surprised about the rating of this place but still check it out. They have a large variety of cake and drinks. 

We ordered the Raindrop coffee as it was one of their top items. The presentation of this was extremely cute. It was  a cup of coffee with a cloud of cotton candy on top. The steam from the coffee would melt the cotton candy and make it drip like rain. This drink was good for pictures but coffee was just average. 

The Kiwi ice mug was also a really unique drink. The drink literally came in an ice shaped cup. The ice cup kept the drink cold. 

Cookies and cream crepe cake and Strawberry crepe cake. Were decent. Not that good. The cream felt thick and not smooth. Millie's creperie, crepe cakes are better. 

Overall average place nothing really outstandingly delicious. Service is really slow though."}
{"text":"We had green tea crepe cake and something else (Sakura cake?) they were just ok but bloody expensive. I don't think we will go again."}
{"text":"I've been reading quite a few reviews about this place and many have commented on their service. I suppose, it really depends on the days and servers that are working. The service I've experienced today was very prompt. As soon as we sat down we were given menus. It took about 10mins for our order to arrive. The cake came first and then our drinks.

We ordered the Chestnut Millie Crepe cake and I found the filling to be too creamy. They use crumbled chestnut however, it lacked the chestnut taste. The filling was very heavy in creamy taste, it leaves a buttery aftertaste in your mouth. However, the pastry (crepe) of the cake was a good texture.

I ordered their Cappuccino and loved the little cup and plate they served it in! You can definitely taste the espresso in their cappuccino and its not too milky tasting. I must say it was a pretty good cup of cappuccino. 

Nice place to relax and kick back especially if you take the window seat! Very quiet cafe tucked into a small street on yonge. Will definitely give their Durian Millie Crepe Cake next time!"}
{"text":"food was just okay. they.do have some creative food like special coffee or cheesecake"}
{"text":"Extremely slow speed and low quality service having horrible experiences with this cafe."}
{"text":"Just be fair. The crepe cake tastes good but the green tea latte is tasteless. Cake costs $7.19 and small latte costs $4.95 are way over priced. Tried it but won't go back again"}
{"text":"I arrived here on a Friday night, around 7pm, for a small get together and teaser before dinner. The place was empty with just another couple there which I thought would be fantastic giving it an intimate setting and quietness to catch up with friends.

As I looked through the menu, from Instagram and previously seen YELP pictures, I knew what I wanted to order already. Their rainy coffee was a top hit so I pointed to the waitress that I wanted both that and the \"baymax floating marshmallow\" drink. My friend got her matcha drink roughly ten minutes in. A good five minutes later, my other friend's milk tea came. About 45 minutes later after asking the waitresses where the rest of drinks were, they kept insisting they was coming. Finally, the raining coffee came and it was so neat to see the coffee's steam melt the cotton candy atop making it literally rain sugar into the coffee. 

After taking paparazzi style pictures of the raining coffee, I was just waiting for my baymax drink to come. Alas, it never came and as we saw other people's drinks from another table get served, we decided to once again inquire as a friend was paying for his drinks. Turns out my drink was never ordered and what pissed us off even more was the fact that my friend had seen them take pictures of drinks they were making for clients behind the counter. I suppose in a matter that is fine but espresso can only be served and drank after a certain time before it's no longer effective and good. 

On top of the all year round cheap holiday decorations that is an eye sore, it's safe to say that I will not come back and praise Initium Cafe even more!"}
{"text":"I love their latte n cake, their strawberry n blueberry cake tastes good. The fruit is fresh. Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"I had a durian mille crepe cake and the raindrop coffee. The coffee was delicious and the setup for the cotton candy was really cute! The durian crepe cake had a decent durian flavour but I would have liked it to have a stronger taste to it since I am a huge fan of durian anything. A little less cream would have been better as well.

The store itself was pretty cute too! Service could have been faster since it was a slow night but it's ok if you're just catching up with some friends."}
