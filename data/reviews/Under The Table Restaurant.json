{"text":"Amazing food, unbeatable service. Super happy I used Yelp to find this hidden gem. Had a personal experience with the owner - watched some Hell's Kitchen with her - she made me a chocolate martini (Which was perfect) I had steak, lobster claw, and shrimp with a delectable sauce - The vegetables were soaked in a wine bath - I almost ate every last bite - which for me can be hard with that amount of food - would recommend you try it to anyone who wants from scratch food made from real ingredients - completely unprocessed ."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but far away from amazing.
 I had chef's wings and 4 cheese pesto pasta. Wings aren't bad and are well presented but not yet called delicious. 
As for the pasta, it's too salty due to tons of cheese. I could barely taste any pesto. The good thing is the veggie ingredients used taste fresh.

It's a nice visit and the owner is super sweet (kept giving me extra napkins for wings without asking). But the food I had is just so so."}
{"text":"Greated warmly by the owner who called me \"honey\".  Sat down and the pleasant server delivered the same warmth.  Ordered the generously portioned chicken, waffles with bacon and maple syrup. The batter was so fluffy.  The chicken had the perfect crust.  The food delivered pure comfort on a winter's day.  Will be back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing jerk chicken, and funnel cake would come back again and again."}
{"text":"Although I am of West Indian Heritage, I tend not to be the biggest fan of West Indian Restaurants.  As a small business owner myself, I definitely like to support other small businesses so on Saturday night, my sister and I decided to try this place out.
Thank goodness we did!  Where to start ...

FOOD
Absolutely delicious, great presentation, good mix of flavours that blend together perfectly.  I would call it West Indian/Caribbean fusion.   I had the Thai Beef Salad which would be perfect if they dropped the Thai descriptor (as one who loves Thai food and flavours I can say there wasn't much that was Thai about this salad but I didn't care it was so great!)  My sister had the jerk chicken salad ... perfection!
Great portion sizes and good pricing.
We had the salad because our server/hostess suggested that we leave room for dessert.  Drum roll please.  So glad we listened ...Dessert was like heaven in your mouth.  The funnel cake (yes, I said funnel cake ...really why don't more places have this on the menu) was made to order ... I really didn't care how many calories I was consuming at that moment, it was worth the extra dress size.  The same could be said of the brownie with cheese cake in the middle, I mean really brownies and cheesecake, you had me from the get go (just so you don't think I'm a pig, I didn't have both desserts .. my sister had the brownie, I just snuck a taste).
Next time, I'm going in super hungry so I can have an entree and dessert! 

SERVICE/ATMOSPHERE
As I sat down, I felt as though I was in someone's home.  I was seated by a super friendly server who made sure that I was comfortable in her place.  As I sat down, a pitcher of water with lemon appeared on my table before I could even ask.  The seating was comfortable, the decor was cozy and tasteful and the music was lively but just at the right level.  Loud enough for you to enjoy, not so loud that you have to yell at your dinner companion.  Kim is the most attentive server without being overbearing.  At the end of our meal she invited us to stay as long as we wished, which we did because the atmosphere was so great.  If we didn't have things to do that night, I'm sure they would have had to kick us out.

This is a place that you should not miss, get in here quick before you have to line up for a seat!"}
{"text":"Great service from Kim and the team. Kim was very welcoming, the restaurant didn't have a high chair but she purchased one before our reservation date knowing we were coming with a toddler.

Good was fresh, flavourful and delicious!

Definitely worth the trip from Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Sunday for brunch. Service was pretty efficient and very friendly. Ordered the chicken and waffles with bacon maple and the BF ordered the special (smoked salmon bennies). Also got some coffee and OJ (basically Folger's instant and Tropicana) which was a little underwhelming, but when the food came... Wow! Big servings with even bigger taste. Loved absolutely everything about the chicken and waffles. Put on some of that crazy homemade hot sauce on the side and you're done for. You can pretty much die happy then and there. The bennies were really good too, and for $9? Can't go wrong. I totally recommend everyone to try this place. Will also be coming back for lunch next time to try their jerk and oxtail."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun. The food is comforting and delicious. The owner Kim makes you feel right at home. Completely unpretentious food at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I had the chicken and waffles with bacon topping. It was delicious and very filling. The place is very small. It accommodates about 30 people max.  The waitresses are very familiar with the guests so it has a very relaxed atmosphere.  Everyone feels welcomed - or at least that was my impression. This seems to be a popular spot for carry out for the locals. That's another good sign that this is good restaurant."}
{"text":"Almost missed it as we drove down the street. Came just in time for a table for two without a wait for brunch last weekend. I absolutely loved the soft scrambled eggs. As an egg enthusiast, I must say that I'm still thinking of how delicious it was. My boyfriend had the jerk chicken waffles, which he thought was just ok. He requested medium for his spice level but it tasted more like mild. The waitress offered him a side of the spicer sauce if needed while we were ordering but she forgot to bring it with our meals. Didn't bother to ask for the sauce after a while as we were mostly done with our meals. We loved the affordable prices as well. I'd come back again for sure if in the area again."}
{"text":"Finally had the food here given the great reviews. Had the jerk chicken and it was solid. Overall the hype here is well deserved. Around Cabbagetown, you won't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our brunch here. We inadvertingly came here quite close to brunch ending but they let us in anyway which was sound. 
I got the chicken and waffles which was great and my gf got the French toast. She said it was really good and extremely filling.

Overall service was great and the food too. Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"One of the best finds ever!!  Absolutely amazing food and the most friendly and inviting atmosphere that I've ever experienced. 

My wife and I typically race through our meals when we dine out but felt we could've stayed until closing, enjoying the conversation and our dessert (definitely try the brownie!). 

Jerk chicken was the best I've ever eaten and ask for the hot sauce if you really want that extra kick. 

Definitely going back for the oxtail as well as the mac and cheese (when it's back)!"}
{"text":"The portions were plentiful and the food was delicious! Ordered the fried chicken and oxtail meal and couldn't decide which one to eat that night. Ended up taking a bit of both lol."}
{"text":"Fantastic food with great seasoning!  The jerk chicken sandwich was fab. Everyone was very friendly. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Love love this place!!! Everything was delicious!! Jerk chicken was moist and well-seasoned. Great ribs and oxtail!! Yummy tropical drink!!! Out-of-this-world funnel cake!! Best dinning experience I've ever had"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Wonderful food , friendly atmosphere and attentive service. Went for the first time ten days ago with six people and have been back twice .  We have tried the meatloaf (delicious and so moist and flavourful) the Ackee and salt cod (creamy cod  with just right texture of rice and peas, oxtails , spaghetti bolognese (this dish was so good we went back to order it as takeout, the chicken,avocado and b.l.t. Sandwich which,with their fabulous fries was enough for two of us. It a very long time since I have been in such a comfortable atmosphere and served by such lovely people"}
{"text":"So we found this place on yelp and their menu looked the most appealing, I can honestly say it was freaking delicious. Kim, she took our order but I think she was the owner..she has a wonderful spirit and had great conversation. Amanda was another server, she was soo nice also. She made us the signature drink, it was fruity and just amazing. Of course we came in looking for liquor at 10am but Canadian law says 11. As soon as time changed, Amanda was right on it for us. The place is a bit small but that just makes it more intimate. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! We went for lunch after the lunch rush (past 1pm) and it was pretty empty. Our food came out pretty fast as well. 

They have a great selection of food with meat, seafood and vegetarian options! As I am vegetarian, I had ordered the curry cream vegetable pasta. When the food came out, it looked absolutely amazing. However when I started eating, I noticed there was chicken in my pasta and immediately notified Kim (our waitress). She was really nice and apologized multiple times for the error. She even gave me 50% off my bill las a result which I honestly did not expect. In the end, the pasta was worth it and I enjoyed it tremendously!  

We also ordered their famous funnel cake. It was one of the best funnel cakes I've tried and the portions are huge so we were able to share with 6 people in our group. 

Really loved this place! Kim was absolutely amazing! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Comfort Food: yes, comforting is definitely the right word! Everything about this place from the food, the service and the ambiance made it a comfortable, pleasant experience! This little gem in the east end serves an amazing plate of chicken waffles along with a side of warm, friendly service. We loved the service and the wicked throwback music. 

Can't wait to return for their dinner! Definitely recommend others to come and check them out!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend was on yelp and found this restaurant with great reviews about ox-tail.  We decided to check this restaurant out with a few friends after a day out in the sun at the beach.

Love the food here. Great quality and friendly service!

Oxtail is tender and falls off the bone.
Amazing Jerk chicken.
Desserts are delicious.

{"text":"Travel weary, my companions and I stumbled on the spot hungry for brunch. Unfortunately for us, it was already after 11 o'clock, and it was a Thursday. After handing us the lunch menus and seeing her crestfallen faces, Betty (the chef) said that she'd make an exception and handed us the brunch menus. I ordered a Bloody Mary - wait, make that a Bloody Caesar - and was served a perfectly spiced salty tomato beverage to start my day. 

Only the tea drinker opted out of coffee, but she soon realized she was missing out. This coffee is brewed with a special blend of spices that will make you crave it for weeks afterward. It's seriously worth a stop just for the coffee alone. 

Once we received our breakfasts (reasonably fast, considering they'd closed service an hour before), all talk ceased. We were far too busy filling our faces with delicious fried chicken, eggs with hollandaise, and waffles (well, we all had our own combo of it, anyway). Forget going Deep South USA - hit this stuff instead. 

Kim, our waitress, was an absolute charmer. Recognizing that we were out of towers, she started naming all the best pride spots. She and her wife Betty took care of us like we were a part of the family. We ended up going back twice more during our stay since they were so kind and the food was tasty!"}
{"text":"When I first walked in I said \"where am I?\" then we met Kim, who is the loveliest and will call you babe and honey and make you feel like she loves you. Then there's Betty's food - I had oxtail and jerk chicken and it was an epic dish! I will say it's the best jerk chicken I've had in the city. Along with a lovely glass of red wine that I had Kim pick for me. My dinner comrades loved their meals as well.
We are SO coming back for brunch. Do not miss this place! I (heart) Kim + Betty."}
{"text":"Went there with my family for a casual quick dinner.

The atmosphere seems like a divey-bar turned into a restaurant-I mean this is a very cute and charming way.  

Food is very value, dinner is approximately $15/person and large portions are given.  My only call out is that the food is quite salty, but the attentiveness of the waitress, who is always there to fill up your glass, definitely helps.

I would recommend the oxtail for sure.

Restaurant is definitely 5 stars for service.  The one waitress that was working was very sweet and attentive- she gave us free wings (which were delicious) as the perogies were sold out.  There seemed to quite a few regulars there as well."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I stopped here after reading the other great reviews on Yelp, and they certainly lived up to the hype. Our server, Kim was fantastic. Very friendly and attentive. We all ordered different things: chicken wings, spaghetti with bolognese, meatloaf dinner, and the special for the evening, which was a salmon & avocado sandwich. Though we were delightfully full, we opted for the funnel cake dessert. Everything was delicious. We enjoyed the cozy interior and the literal \"hole-in-the-wall\" feel. It was quiet inside and intimate. I would say they only had about 6 tables in there total. The bar was not fully stocked but the \"glass\" of wine I ordered was easily 2 or 3 pours worth. Overall this was one of the most memorable restaurants we have visited during our first trip to Toronto. Wish we could come back again!"}
{"text":"Great place, excellent food and very homey atmosphere. Outstanding service to say the least. Definitelly coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch. Got introduced to this place this weekend and what a little gem it is. Reasonably priced  and good portion servings. Friendly staff adds to the charm of this casual gathering place. Can't wait to come back to try their dinner entrees next time"}
{"text":"A place where you always feel welcomed like one of the family and leave with a full belly."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food amazing service and amazing deser what more could u ask for? Its probably my new comfort food spot"}
{"text":"I almost never trek down here on Parliament, besides coming down to 'Kingyo' once. We actually came by when it was nice and quiet, so we didn't have to wait for a table. The place is just downstairs, and seats less than 30 ppl including the bar...They also take reservation, which means it could not work well for walk-in ppl.

We were greeted by 'Kim' who is one of the owner, along with her partner who is the Head Chef. Kim is as normal as anyone, with being honest about the restaurant life. She definitely wants to improve the neighborhoods' image and I wish for this place to do well long-term.

We ordered two apps and two mains. This place is one of the few 'comfort food' place we got the chance to dine in.

Chef Wings ($8)- I would've preferred more wings, but got drums instead. The wings were not bad, a bit overcooked and dry for our liking.

Perogies ($8)- 6pcs i believe. Topped with bacon, sour cream, cheddar cheese. My gf liked this dish. I thought its alright. But its comfort food, so we may pass on this next time.

Jerk Poutine ($11)- jerk chicken meat with gravy and cheese. This is good portion. I would have to say the 'best poutine' i had is at 'Come and Get It'... This place is still fine, it just reminded of something else.

Oxtail Dinner ($14)- We're use to eating this dish at 'Island Spice' close to our area we stay in, and my gf enjoyed it very much. Its served with rice n peas, salad, and coleslaw.

I'd say we would come back next time to try other dishes they have. Prices are reasonable, even brunch if we wake up.

I also like to note that Kim gave us very nice service and definitely felt 'taken cared' of =) THX!"}
{"text":"really good flavor!! best dishes ever eaten. Strongly recommend all the dishes. If I have more time stay in Toronto I prefer eat at this restaurant everyday!"}
{"text":"Their cooking and food handling methods must have been under the table because I got really bad food poisoning here. An hour after having the meatloaf for dinner, I was stuck in a washroom puking my guts out. I felt so unwell that I would rather stay in the washroom to throw up than go to my musical. This basically wasted my tickets and ruined my date.

I don't particularly care if I'm being paid to go back to this restaurant again because I'm not rolling the dice. I would recommend that you avoid this place for that reason as well."}
{"text":"Lived up to the high rating.

This place is in the lower level of a building, and it is a really inviting place with a diverse clientele. 

People come here to eat alone, with their families, with their date, with their friends. A huge range of age groups as well.

The food is very comforting, and they have a good menu with something for everyone. Ox tail and jerk chicken stood out to me, as I do not really see these items at a nice sit-down neighbourhood resto. Oxtail was $14 and came with a fresh romaine salad and really clean-tasting creamy coleslaw. I think they used some form of apple in their coleslaw, as it tasted light and had a nice, almost fruity scent. I could be wrong of course, it might have just been really good coleslaw. Ox tail was flavourful, and not spicy. Rice and beans was good. 

I can tell they make their food with care. Everything was arranged nicely on the plate, and tasted fresh, and healthier than other places.

They had three specials the night I went, and they will explain each one to you when they sit you down.

Service was very, very nice. Very home-ly and genuine. Felt like a warm neighbourhood restaurant, which it is essentially.

My only complaint is that the place is too small for its popularity. It filled up quick, and some tables are way too close to the front door. It would not be nice to have one of these tables during the winter."}
{"text":"Wow, what an amazing experience!  I ordered the Bacon Dijon Chicken and Waffles, my wife had the Salmon Eggs Benedict. Both were simply excellent. The atmosphere was cozy, and were made to feel comfortable from the start. We left feeling like we'd been going there for years. 

As others have said, it is a small space.  So be sure to call ahead for reservations. If in winter, try asking for seats further from the door.

Overall, 100% great, I would gladly make the trip from Brampton again."}
{"text":"My family was in Toronto for the week to go see a Blue Jays game, a Blue Rodeo concert, and attend the Roger's Cup Tennis tourney. Who'd have thought the highlight of our trip was this restaurant. Awesome food and Kim and Betty have true passion for their business.  We had a great meal and an awesome time. They had a seafood soup special that was so good that my daughter had a 2nd bowl for her dessert!  These reviews are not kidding. If you are in Toronto, as Tina Fey would say, \"you want to go to there\""}
{"text":"as good as sex

I have tried countless jerk chicken places, high end bars with steak and italian restaurants. This place easily beats them at less than half the price. The portions are very large, and the cost to quantity ratio is great for people that don't have a lot of money(me). Me and my girlfriend had the 10oz ribeye steak for $19, seafood pasta for $16, and the jerk chicken dinner for $12. Lastly, we had the citrus creamcicle cake for $6. The steak we ordered rare was cooked to perfection. The gravy was fantastic and complemented the mashed potatoes perfectly. The veggies were cooked well enough that I would actually eat them more often on a regular basis. The seafood pasta actually had a lot of seafood. There were muscles, shrimp, onions, broccoli, spinach, fish. Wow. The jerk chicken was not sandpaper. It was very moist and had the perfect amount of spice. The rice that went with it was well cooked too. Lastly, was the dessert. It was a little dry, but otherwise it was perfect. Maybe it's Caribbean style?"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  They're running a bunch of specials to introduce themselves to the neighbourhood, so you can get a tremendous amount of delicious food for very little.  Yesterday's special was a combo plate of the oxtail and jerk chicken--both delicious!  The oxtail is rich and fall-off-the-bone tender and the jerk chicken is nicely spiced.  They don't have a liquor license yet, but once they do, I expect it'll be busy all the time!"}
{"text":"Kim is amazing. The fried chicken and waffles was terrific, juicy, the waffles were deep friend too, yet Uber light.
my friends had the full monty, and the Big Breakfast... the flap jacks were light as air as well.  
comes VERY much recommended by me, and I LOVE to eat... former chef too, I know good - and this place was great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just visited under the table for dinner on a Friday night. We made reservations the same day and were accommodated. Kim is amazing and so warm ! We absolutely loved the atmosphere and the food was delicious. Kim treated us like family and this was also reflected in the food. We both ordered the jerk chicken dinner which had a mouth watering slaw on the side, jasmine rice and salad. We ordered the garlic bread with cheese which was also delicious. The place is small -only a few tables but the desserts and specials were also quite spectacular looking although we didn't get to taste. We will definitely be going back and it will be because of Kim and the home cooked food. Mmmm !!!"}
{"text":"Worth coming to come check this little place jn the middle of parliament, I'm definitely bringing friends to try it out"}
{"text":"Excellent food with an even better atmosphere.  Waitress treated us like we were old friends. Great food at an affordable price!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. Very unassuming place with a very homey and welcoming atmosphere.  I really wanted some delicious food. Consider myself a foodie. Absolutely made the right choice. I had a jerk recipe entrée which completely blew my mind with the flavor profile. The Bailey's brownie and ice cream for dessert was just perfect. Kim and Betty are the best. Don't walk run to this place."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I have a monthly dinner club where we check out restaurants in the city. We decided to check out under the table given the good reviews.

Food was really good!! I personally recommend the seafood pasta and the oxtail dinner. Funnel cake dessert is a must.

The owner is very friendl"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. Had the jerked chicken poutine. So good. Would come back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Feb 2016 - Saturday brunch
AMAZING $5 Classic breakfast. Good coffee. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Great staff and delicious food. Particularly recommended for breakfast/brunch.

The only issue I have with this place is that it seems to be unpredictably closed. I've tried going there twice, only to discover a notice at the door explaining the cook had to leave or so. The third time was the charm and well worth the effort though!"}
{"text":"Seeing all the hype on Yelp, it was finally time to give this place a try ourselves.  We went first for brunch, and loved it so much that we asked to see the dinner menu, and tried out their dinner dishes a few days later.  Each time, we were able to make a reservation to avoid the lineups;  and service was friendly and prompt, despite how busy it was, especially at brunch.

For brunch, there were three of us and we had:  Prime Rib benny;  Chef's breakfast;  and Chicken and Waffles (with bacon).  All were fantastic.  The special that day was actually jerk chicken and waffles and it made for a really difficult decision for what to choose for brunch.  But knowing that I wanted to come back for their jerk chicken dinner, I went for the chicken and waffles.

Then for dinner a few days later, we ordered pirogies and fried pickles as appies;  then the Fried Chicken;  the Jerk Chicken dinner (swapped out jasmine rice for rice and peas) and the Curry pasta.  Everything was scrumptious, and we were especially impressed by the moistness of the jerk chicken (and boneless too!) and the absolutely lick-the-plate delicious curry cream sauce for the pasta.

For brunch, we had booked for 1030am on a Saturday, and there was already a line-up of people waiting outside.  Dinner was for 7pm and there were a few empty tables at arrival, but due to a number of walk-ins the place filled up by 8pm.  

We noticed there is a Yelp check-in for 10% off, but the prices here are so reasonable that we felt bad and didn't use it!  (Yeah, we're sucks that way, but want to support a small business and make sure it sticks around!)  

We don't live close by, but will certainly continue to make the drive to visit Under The Table regularly!"}
{"text":"The best Caribbean food in the city. The service is amazing very friendly and personal. The Sunday brunch is the best we ever had and we've had it in some of the best places in the city. I wish they had a wider variety of cocktails. Would definitely visit them again..."}
{"text":"I would like to take this chance to say thanks to your restaurant. The fantastic service you have given to us was like a breath of fresh air. The staff who served us was very fantastic, friendly, professional and certainly awesome. They made it easier for us to decide what to order. I highly recommend your restaurant to our friends and family. Your dedication in your work must others should learn from you."}
{"text":"Wonderful restsurant!! Great food, laid back atmosphere.  The food is 5 star and everyone is so friendly....coming from an American..."}
{"text":"Been here twice now for brunch. Food is great, portions are generous and not too expensive. Not to mention that the owner is super friendly! Their daily specials are great for what you get. Definitely an interesting menu set as well."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly and food taste amazing, but ALL my friends including me had food poisoning afterwards"}
{"text":"Great find off the beaten path. You can tell it is a popular neighborhood hangout. Kim is fabulous and makes sure you are well taken care of."}
{"text":"Okay, so it took 5 visits for me to finally up my star rating to 5, but this place deserves it. If you're looking for a Cheers-like atmosphere (except still no booze!) where it feels like a family dinner in several levels (comfy décor, friendly camaraderie, traditional home-cooked tastes/flavours) then you've found your place.

Things I have eaten that have been delicious:
- oxtail
- meatloaf
- burger
- chicken noodle soup
- leek soup
- jerk chicken
- ackee and salt fish
- the free starters of pita and garlic bread with chipotle mayo....mmmmm...
- funnel cake
- cheesecake

Two words: eat here"}
{"text":"Wonderful chef ! Baby ribs were awesome and loved the spicy salad!"}
{"text":"There needs to be more restaurants like this in Toronto.

Large portions, very reasonable prices.

Excellent variety of simple (and simply-described) items on the menu.

Service that was attentive without being overbearing and very friendly without being OTT or insincere.

Cosy, relaxing setting and atmosphere that wasn't trying to fit a certain niche or cater to a certain crowd. Comfortable and enjoyable for all.

Said reasonable prices also extended to alcoholic drinks, pop and juice. No outrageous mark-ups.

Discounts for Yelp check-ins.

And absolutely STUNNING food. I had the jerk chicken wrap and it blew me away. The wrap was overflowing with spicy, perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked and marinaded FRESH chicken that was juicy beyond belief. I was absolutely stuffed halfway through even though I only had a salad instead of fries on the side.

I came here to celebrate a new job and could not have been happier with my overall experience.

We cannot wait to come back for another dinner. Before we left we asked the owner Kim what the best time for weekend brunch was and if we could make a reservation, because we cannot wait to try the brunch menu out as well.

To repeat: there needs to be more restaurants like this, not just in Toronto (which has a pretty amazing food scene already), but everywhere."}
{"text":"This is my first choice for brunch.  The price to quality ratio is off the charts.  Restaurants charging twice often have inferior food.

Great dishes include the fried chicken waffle, jerk chicken, rib eye, seafood pasta. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The salmon and shrimp sandwich was the best sandwich I had during my four day trip to Toronto of all the restaurants we tried. They had some super hot pepper sauce that was great, too. French fries were also awesome! It looks a little rough around the edges but don't judge it-  give it a try!"}
{"text":"So hard to find amazing food in Toronto for under $15 these days. This restaurant kills it by providing unreal flavour, great prices, large portions, AND awesome service. 5 stars!

Ordered the jerk plate btw"}
{"text":"Under the table is one of the best restaurants i've been to in the GTA. It's certainly my favourite. I won't go into extreme detail on the food as i'm sure you can read below. This place executes everything perfectly. Very inexpensive, VERY delicious and amazing service. My friend and I walked in here and it was empty. At first we were a little skeptical, but once i had a bit of that jerk chicken, I couldn't remember where i was. It is that good. If you're deciding whether or not to come here, just do it. Thank you Under The Table. I'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"Very good food for a good price!! The ladies here are lovely and this is a cozy little spot. Service is also great. :) it only opens til 11pm except for Thursday's!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner at 6pm on a Saturday night as it was close by to the Phoenix Concert Theatre. From the outside, it is hard to spot as it is on the lower story - you have to walk down a flight of stairs and there is a black curtain that covers the door. It's a cozy restaurant with seating for around 25 people, but we were seated right away as it wasn't too packed yet. 

I ordered the Jerk Chicken Pasta, while my friend ordered the Jerk Chicken Dinner, and we were so impressed. Generous portions of chicken (which tasted amazing), and the pasta was a creamy, buttery, cheesy sauce - so delicious. The bill came to around $15/person (including tax/tip), and it was definitely worth it, we were so full. 

The waitress we had was very friendly, but she left halfway through our meal and service was slower once she was gone with only 2 servers remaining ( it took a while to get the bill).

Will definitely be back to try out their brunch menu!"}
{"text":"I loved it so much when I went with my friends that I took my husband the next week. We started with the wings (a nice jerk flavouring), my husband had the jerk chicken poutine and I had the seafood special. 

The wings were really good, we both enjoyed them. When my husband got his poutine I thought it looked a little small, I was wrong, it was a good size and delicious, however, I do wish it came with ox-tail gravy. I'll have to remember to ask next time. The seafood special was okay, the fish was a little bland but the sauce was nice; I wish I'd gone with the ox-tail. 

Kim was fabulous again though. As we were leaving she asked if we found her on Yelp, I told her I had come in last week with my friends. She immediately recognized me and told me exactly where we were sitting and described the friends I was with. This kind of personal attention is rare these days."}
{"text":"Great food & kind restaurant owners... I never knew the place before.. Good thing I have my Yelp app.. 
I like the sirloin steak with perfectly cooked onion. I also like the Brownies (:
Will definitely come back!!! 
Good job!"}
{"text":"worth it just for the customer service. owners are incredibly nice and make you feel like a queen. 

they also have really good jerk chicken. good experience all around."}
{"text":"We were looking brunch place to try and found Under the Table on Yelp. They had some special items that aren't typical in other brunch places (ie, not just the typical diner breakfasts). The staff were pleasant and gave us a warm welcome. We ordered the chicken waffles w mixed berry sauce, and the 10oz ribeye steak with eggs.

The chicken and waffles was tasty. The waffle was also fried, so it's not health food, but you don't order chicken and waffles as a healthy option. The berry sauce was also good but too much of it could overwhelm the waffles and chicken. Other than the berry sauce you can choose bacon maple dijon, which we'll try next time. The steak was also good, it seemed a little small, but was tasty and came with roasted potatoes, three eggs, and fried mushrooms. The steak went well with the mushrooms.

Overall it was pleasant experience and we'll be returning :)"}
{"text":"***cue Meg Ryan voice ***
Yes, Yes. YES!

Saw the yelp reviews and decided to give it a try. My daughter tried poutine for the first time in Vancouver a few months ago and demanded it on this visit (we are from Washington state). Ended up getting a side regular poutine for her (apparently I raised a classicist. Who knew?) and a beef poutine and fried chicken for my wife and I to share. All the food was great and very fairly priced. As much as I love me some poutine, the chicken was the star: tender, juicy, crispy, and really flavorful. 

Additionally, Kim was fabulous, friendly, and responsive.  Our daughter had just returned from the Maplelea store and wanted her doll to dine with us  Kim brought out an extra table setting complete with perfectly-sized shrimp fork and made sure our daughter and Caroline were satisfied with their settings. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I had the oxtail dinner and my friend had the jerk chicken. Both were extremely delicious! The service was amazing and although it's a bit out of the way for me, it's on both of our 'revisit' lists!
My friend is from Detroit and she told me she woke up a week later one morning dreaming about the jerk chicken! Definitely recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this hidden gem over and over again and every time leave totally satisfied. Food is excellent  fresh and plentiful, prices are excellent for the quality of dishes prepared.Kim and Betty work as a great team are very pleasant and eager to welcome you into their cozy restaurant. We live close by and have heard nothing but great reviews from the local Cabbagetowners, I would highly recommended this place. A great place to go for a casual evening of fine food."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner. Very small place, probably packed during regular times. Sort of a home-y feel. We had the oxtail and the seafood pasta topped off with funnel cake for dessert. The oxtail had many bones, so it felt like not enough meat. The seafood pasta was fantastic. The funnel cake wasn't at all what we expected,  do not recommend it. It tasted way to greasy. 

The staff were supper friendly and attentive.  I would come again."}
{"text":"I went for brunch with a buddy and I had the Chicken and Waffles and he had the fritata. We were both thoroughly impressed. If there was one complaint was that the waffles were a bit soft and I like them a bit crispy on the outside. It was still top notch. I also had a side of home fries as well. It's a small intimate place and it was busy, but I see why. The wait staff was friendly. Food did take a while but I didn't care too much as I was having good convo with my friend. I really liked this place and I would go back to try their dinner dishes. I was impressed. Excellent breakfast and brunch spot in Cabbagetown. I can't wait to go back actually, I've made up my mind."}
{"text":"Amazing service, great food and fun environment. More than happy to be supporting a local establishment. Will definitely be back to this joint. Thank you for an amazing meal"}
{"text":"Wow.  This was my first time here and the great reviews are well deserved. This is a lovely, down to earth restaurant with excellent home cooked food and great service. While the decor is slightly outdated, I think it may be intentional as it reinforces the fact that this place is not meant for those who judge a restaurant based on its appearance - its merit and reputation is instead earned from its superb food and warm ambiance. We had the jerk chicken and oxtail which were very well prepared and as good as advertised. They also have their own custom made hot sauce for the jerk chicken which was very aromatic and flavourful. 

It was a vey unique experience and a nice change from the pretentious, over priced and over rated restaurants that are typically found in the downtown core. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I have been there several times I either order the soup of the day which is usually really rich and hearty, I have ordered the huge steak sandwich really tender,chicken wings awesome and the ox tail. Great prices and amazing customer service,Betty and Kim always have a friendly smile when you walk in. I can't wait to try their brunch menu and for them to get their liquor license which now they do! . I could see this place being like cheers the TV show where everyone knows your name."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner while visiting Toronto for the first time.... Such a cozy and welcoming environment. I can see why it has become such a local favorite. The food is fantastic, the music Kim plays is eclectic, and most importantly, the food is amazing. And the aforementioned Kim is such a sweetheart. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Lovely little place that I found on Yelp.  Went there, Got 2 chicken dishes, ate one when I got home.  Nicely done.  The rice & beans is excellent.  Jerk chicken, just the same.  Friendly server, great food.  Looks like a nice place for a first date.  Parliament still impresses me.  A lot of restaurants forget to check their end product.  This place is one of those places where the staff probably eat their own food by choice."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing. The best food and service I've ever received. The ambiance was incredible, you can feel the love and care that the servers have. We ordered the cajun wings and they accidentally gave us the chef wings. They were so friendly about the whole situation and gave us another order of wings. Both wings were the best we've ever had. This is an amazing place to go on a date or just have brunch"}
{"text":"Was in the neighbourhood and craving some jerk chicken. Was not disappointed!

Ordered the jerk chicken dinner ($13) and the oxtail dinner ($16). Both were extremely flavourful and came with large sides of salad, rice and coleslaw. The hot sauce was to die for as well. They also gave water with slices of cucumber in it-nice touch. 

Service was so friendly and felt cozy the moment we walked in the door. Restaurant is on the small side and had dim lights-perfect to get to know someone ;)

Would come back again and definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and price. The ox tail was amazing. I would definitely go again in the future."}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews, Me and my brothers can't resist ourselves to visit there. But believe me We just loved this place. I personally love how welcoming the servers were. We had dinner there and the food was preety awesome. 

The prices were really good for that awesome items. Will visit there again on my birthday."}
{"text":"I recommend this place for the delicious food, fair prices, extremely friendly and competent service. I'll come back (for sure) and bring more friends ;-)"}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken in Toronto by far nice people , top 3 restaurants I've been to in Toronto"}
{"text":"This place just opened up literally downstairs from my apartment, and it is phenomenal. They seem to switch specials every few days, and all the meals are cooked with care. Their menu is eclectic, with cuisine spanning over several regions -- from Caribbean to Asian. 

We went there for brunch and for dinner (take-out). For brunch, we had the classic items. I had a pancake with fresh fruit, and bangers on the side. My dining companion had eggs and bacon. 

For dinner we were more adventurous. I had oxtail with rice and bean, and coleslaw on the side. The oxtail had been cooked so tender that it almost fell off the bone. My boyfriend had General Tao's chicken with greens. But this wasn't your shitty Chinese fast food General's Tao -- the chicken was fresh and the seasoning tasted different, more homemade, and with a Northern flair. 

Next time we are probably going to try their shepherd's pie. Can't wait!

Also, the service is always amazing. Both times we were served by some very enthusiastic women who appeared as if they were proud of the food they were putting on our table -- as they should have been!

I'm really happy this place opened up because there is a dearth of good restaurants in Cabbagetown, and for someone who is often too lazy to cook like me, but still a snob about food, this place hits the spot."}
{"text":"So we've been here like five or six times this year. We'd be here more often but we live uptown. This place is always consistently good and definitely a hidden gem of the city. Prices are more than reasonable for the quality of food and the only brunch place I've gone back to multiple times. 

So of the food we've ordered here:
Pancakes are big, light and fluffy.
Jerk chicken dinner is beautifully seasoned. I wish it was a bit jucier but boyfriend says its perfect as is.
But what keeps me coming back is the steak eggs benny that comes with a side of home fries that have a beautiful crisp outside and soft insides. *Drool*"}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal. My friends and I dropped by one night on a whim while visiting the city. We didn't expect much, but, man, the food really blew us away! We shared fried chicken, Shepard's pie, poutine, and lasagna; all the dishes were fantastic, leaving us extremely satisfied. Seriously, Under The Table is on my top 10.

We also walked in on karaoke night, which was basically the regulars singing for a few hours. We were the only unique guests in there so we experienced entertainment that felt almost personal. Hell, we even sang a few songs ourselves! That's just a testament to how comfortable the manager and everyone else made us feel because a few of us had never done karaoke before and probably wouldn't have done so in other circumstances.

Environment was small, but cozy and inviting.

Next time I'm in Toronto I will start off with this place, and will end with it as well.

(This review took forever to write... I kept on remembering the fried chicken I had)"}
{"text":"Wow! Simply the best \"home-cooked\" meal I have had in a long time. Stepping into the restaurant was like being in my mother's kitchen, and Kim's warm welcome and smile sealed the deal.

I had the steak with veggies and mash, and my friend had the oxtail. Both were absolutely to die for, and were perfectly cooked and presented. For dessert, I had a crepe stuffed with ice cream and berries which was also amazing.

I will be back to Under the Table very soon. Thanks to Kim, Betty and the rest of the team for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"There is little that can be said about this place, and its management that has not been said very well on here by others. I am continually amazed at how good the food is and how friendly the management, staff, and customers are. If you have not been here you owe it to yourself to experience it."}
{"text":"The most melt in your mouth oxtail ever! Caramelized on the outside, tender inside. The meatloaf and mashed potatoes were savoury, comforting and delicious. 
Our server was the friendliest.  The city's best comfort food."}
{"text":"The food was great - home style, made with love. And the service was amazing! We were there with a stroller and our little one, and they were attentive enough to bring us extra napkins, when they saw him spitting up a bit. Very cozy atmosphere. What a great find!"}
{"text":"Walking in during an evening ice storm in April the restaurant was nearly empty. Some of the staff was huddled by the bar seemingly held hostage by the electric Toronto Raptor playoff game (followed by the Maple Leafs). 

Walking in we were immediately greeted, despite the attention the game held and seated to the table of our choosing. We sat near the huddled group. We were handed our menus and told the specials as the group cheered and jeered the game. 

Our order was taken with attention and the waiter displayed his full endearing personality. I had ordered the Jerk Chicken Poutine my girlfriend the fried chicken dinner. The food was excellent! Tender juicy chicken with the right amount of spice. The waiter was extremely accommodating by bringing out a jar of the house made extra spice so we could add if needed.  

If that wasn't enough reason to stop by then surely it's for the staff. From the beginning they were friendly, funny, attentive, each their own wonderful character and entertaining. Especially if you enjoy local sports teams (or route against their opponents) you need to find your way to Under the Table. 

The staff, the food, the casual friendly atmosphere. What more do you need? Nothing. You need nothing more."}
{"text":"My omelet was very well prepared and tasty, but it's the customer service that stood out. I arrived with a friend who preferred a different table than we chose, but it had a \"Reserved\" sign on it for a regular. We accepted our \"fate\" without complaint. Unbeknownst to us, our server phoned the regular, found he was going to be quite late today, so she gave us his table. 

Secondly, I asked if they had Coke Zero? Nope, only Diet Coke. BUT...she ran a few doors down and bought a Coke Zero from a convenience store, again, without telling us! Talk about service with a smile. That's the kind of customer service that brings people back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I have a monthly dinner club where we check out restaurants in the city. We decided to check out under the table given the good reviews.

Food was really good!! I personally recommend the seafood pasta and the oxtail dinner. Funnel cake dessert is a must.

The owner is very friendly and sweet. She let me stay in the resto while waiting for my husband and offered more water. 

I will be back again!!

Tip: call ahead to reserve a spot."}
{"text":"Great Food! Ox-tail was awesome! Wings too! Great Service! Thanks Kim! Will Definitely be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was a great surprise during our vacation in Toronto. We wanted Caribbean, but the first place we went to was cash only, so we decided to go to the next restaurant with Caribbean options, and we're glad we were had to. 

The jerk chicken poutine was awesome and the jerk chicken plate my boyfriend got was great too. 

Definitely go! 

They serve cucumber water - nice little treat!"}
{"text":"The best chicken and waffle in Toronto and the best I have ever had. The staff is very friendly and excellent. The food is amazing. The location is very unique and nice. Can't wait to stop by again!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and seeing the awesome pictures, my friends and I just HAD to go here.


We made reservations about a week in advance and once we were arrived we were seated right away. The service was great as they constantly filled our waters.

The food was even better! I don't believe I had Caribbean food before but safe to say, it has definitely won me over! 

I had to get the chicken and waffles just to see how they are like compared to the NYC style chicken and waffles and it's a close tie!

I have to say... it might even be slightly better!

I highly recommend coming here if you're in Toronto. The atmosphere was lovely and very energetic and I felt really welcomed! 

Thanks Under the Table!"}
{"text":"We gave this restaurant a second chance and I have to say that I'm glad we did.  The first time we went the service was ok, we didn't really enjoy the food and they didn't have a liquor license.  We decided to give it a chance again as it received so many rave reviews on Yelp...we must have missed something.

First of all, it's still in a basement, but it now feels homey and cozy like you were going over to a friend's house for dinner.  The menu is simple.  It's a lunch/dinner casual style menu with some traditional caribbean dishes.  I have never really tried Caribbean food before, but they put together a combo plate that was to die for...I'm a big fan now.  The Ackee and Salt Fish and Jerk Chicken is a must have...next time I'm going for the oxtail.

Now let's talk about Kim...I have honestly never met someone so authentically nice.  I don't remember the last time I was in a restaurant (or any \"service\" establishment) that was so intent on making my experience enjoyable.

Kim and Betty (I didn't know them when I walked in, but you'll know them by the time you leave), nailed it with what they were trying to accomplish.  A hospitable local restaurant with great food, great service at reasonable prices.

It's not trendy or fine dining but it is what it is and they do what it is extremely well.

P.S....they have a liquor license now too!"}
{"text":"I came here for my boyfriends birthday. I wanted a place that served some carribean food but wasn't you're usual fast-food counter type place.  It's a small quant little place that you would never really find unless you were looking. We ordered curried goat, Jerk Chicken and some desserts. The food was incredible, portions were great and the price was affordable. The waitress was attentive and made me feel like I was dining at my sister's place or with a family member.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Just flew in from New York, and I was in need of food.Great food at a good price. My first meal in the Great Country of Canada and I have to say it was tasty Chicken Parm with Pasta cooked al dente and seasoned to perfection. It was like having the home meal you always wanted and warms your soul. The atmosphere is like the best things of home. Welcoming staff and free pita bread with Chipotle aioli. The apple pie was a great way to finish the meal. Flaky crust with warm apple filled topped with vanilla ice cream and  Caramel drizzle.  This little spot will fill your stomach and comfort the cold."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Our server Kim was a hoot, the chicken and waffles are amazing, but the lamb sausage breakfast platter was our favorite. Small place, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is a really comfortable restaurant because it gives you the welcoming feeling when u walk in, the waitresses are very friendly and they are not like the regular waitress in other restaurant who's trying to their job well, but they are really enjoying working there and talk to the customers, lots of smile, relaxing conversations, I really enjoyed staying there. 
I've had a seafood soup(daily soup), spaghetti bolognese with meatballs, and a fresh berry funnel cake, everything tasted very good and the service is a five star. Customers and staffs who work there are all friendly, this is a heart-warming restaurant that is the treasure of this neighbourhood. 

Btw, great menu, everything sounds delicious and not too many options yet still enough to choose, very reasonable price, I enjoyed a lot and thank you:$"}
{"text":"Comfort food is the only way to describe this place. Unpretentious and relaxed. I quite enjoyed the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the service was amazing as well super friendly I felt right at home. I'm visiting from Florida and let me tell you I would recommend this place to anyone. The food was great. A must eat at place"}
{"text":"food: ok 

service: great

prices: great

decor: ok

overall: its alright.

not too much more to write about"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles. It's not exaggerated, it's amazing. Chicken is crispy and waffles are very tasty. Not your average waffle iron waffles. 
Service was quick and friendly"}
{"text":"Came here early for Sunday brunch. Under the Table makes an excellent omelette, the best I've ever had so far & their hollandaise is like liquid gold. The fresh egg bread was soft, buttery & portion generous. Also I must have had 3 cups of coffee, cuz it was that good.

Kim the owner is such a gracious host. She really knows how to make you feel welcome and ensures you have everything you need. And if you are looking to try their funnel cake she told me it's usually served in the evenings on weekends. 

Cabbagetown is lucky to have this restaurant and I can see why it's a fixture in the community. Thank you Kim for the great service and food, you rock!  I would work \"under the table\" just to eat here."}
{"text":"the best Caribbean food, you do not need to take a plain to south"}
{"text":"Came in with the family for my birthday dinner. Everyone had a different meal and I tried them all meatloaf was amazing !! Spegetti flavourful it was all fantastic. !! The server is a sweetheart. This is Definitely a hidden gem"}
{"text":"Saw this on yelp and headed over for the chicken and waffles dish but unfortunately I missed the brunch hour. I ended up having the jerk chicken dish which was fantastic and the funnel cake with berries and ice cream for dessert....hands down THE BEST DESSERT I've ever had in my life! If they opened one of these in the states I would definitely be a regular. Great place and the staff were extremely kind!"}
{"text":"The food is cooked with love and passion, and shines through onto your plate. Not to mention the staff, my favorite part of the restaurant. They treat you like family, and thus is great place for a solo traveler such as myself to get a wonderful look into Canadian life. I was here 6 months ago, and will be back each time I travel north of the border into Toronto."}
{"text":"Quaint hole in the wall. Great food and excellent service. Oxtail is plentiful and flavourful. Jerk is not saucy but marinated well with spices...my husband thinks it's the best he's ever had. The staff always make you feel welcomed. Fun music too."}
{"text":"I ordered the jerk chicken pasta (which was delicious) and the french toast (which was good... but the amount of cream cheese filling was... overwhelming). Overall, quality food and BIG portion sizes."}
{"text":"Great food, great people. Should definitely try the jerk chicken. Never knew chicken can be cooked to that level of tenderness and still be so chewy. I will be going back for some home made comfort food for sure!"}
{"text":"Great spot for casual brunch -- regular brunch fare plus amazing specials like jerk chicken, lasagna. Such tasty food. 

We also brought kids with us (babies and toddlers) and it was fun."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing the positive reviews

Jerk chicken is delicious. Cooked really well and excellent flavors. Its probably the best that I've had. 

Oxtail dinner is really good as well. As others mentioned, the meat just falls off the bone... I didn't even use  my knife once. The sauce was great too. 

And to top it all off, extremely good value and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Do you miss the Caribbean?   Are you longing to go back on a cruise so you can experience that Caribbean flavour of food you missed so much while intoxicated with Jamaican rum on your last all inclusive resport.  Well here's your place!

Under the table simply put has some of the best food TO has to offer.  Their jerk chicken and fried chicken are things that cause prison riots.  The super secret funnel cake is so good,  you'll think the one you get at wonderland every year tastes like wet diapers from a 76 year old senior citizen.

If you like Caribbean food, or just eating in general do yourself a favour and come here."}
{"text":"I didn't know I had to drive all the way from Maryland to Toronto to find some of the best food ever!!! While vacationing in Canada and being a vivid Yelper I decided to see what the hype was about with this place. Boy were we happy we went there!!! Welcoming, warm and cozy, the owner Kim was so warm and friendly we immediately liked this place. Then the food came out.... WOW!!! Fresh and tasteful! Some of the best ox tails I've ever had and Ive eaten my fair share of West Indian style food. The curry pasta was also to die for! And the cucumber water tastes great!! If I ever go to Toronto again this will be a place I always go to. Sad that it's so far away, this would def be a regular place for me."}
{"text":"This is the sort of place you could pass over 100 times if you weren't careful--- the location is hidden and literally below the ground. But, venture down the stairs and you're in for a treat.

The atmosphere at Under the Table is super warm and friendly- locals and friends fill the place and the staff are all welcoming and helpful.

I had a completely reasonable full rack of ribs for lunch while my partner had the Jerk Chicken. Both were great portions of tender, deliciously spiced meat and veggies for a good price. I left ready to explode with happiness and also possibly excessive amounts of rib. 

Come for the food, fall in love with the vibe! 

Will be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!!! The food was amazing and Kim was such a cool host (Thanks for putting up with my bday crew Kim!!!)).

My friends and I were visiting Toronto for Caribana, and naturally the restaurant was busy, but it was worth the time!

We recommend the chicken and waffles, french toast, friend chicken with mashed potatoes and corn, cheeseburger (yes, the burger), maple crusted salmon.... All Amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"It's places like this that make me miss living in  the east end! This place is full of charm and has such a welcoming environment! They have amazing breakfast specials for a very affordable price! It's quite small and cozy do id recommend going with a few people, and not too big a group. Service is very friendly and make you feel like your at home! I love the booths and set up it gives it a very intimate feel. Advice: don't go if your in a rush. It's the type of place where things can take time and they are quite busy and there's only a few people working, but they're very sweet and do constantly talk w you and help you w what you need. I'm definitely a fan and will return'"}
{"text":"Thank you Toronto yelpers! This restaurant was everything you raved about and more. Searching for a delicious dinner one a freakishly humid evening in Toronto, Gretchen P and I stumbled across this place on the Yelp app.

Completely nondescript, we almost walked right past it before we noticed we had to go downstairs to reach the entrance. We were seated right away by a very sweet and friendly lady who quickly provided us with water and a WHOLE BOWL OF ICE. I thought that was such a nice touch as it was so sweltering and she wanted to make sure we stayed cool.

Our server, whose name escapes me, was positively fantastic. It felt like we were being taken care of by a friend who made the perfect jokes and had excellent timing. I ordered the nachos to start, which were pretty average, but my main entree of greek salad with chicken blew my socks off. The dressing was perfect, the chicken amazing, and everything was crisp and fresh. 

For dinner Gretchen P and I split the funnel cake, which was pretty much out of this world. All crispy, flaky golden fried goodness topped with ice cream and berries...I'm so glad I saved room for it!

Our dining guest had the Ackee and salt fish and it looked awesome! She enjoyed it, and a slice of their toffee cake (which I obviously stole a bite of - yum!).

Despite the sweltering weather (why the lack of air condition, Toronto?!), we had a totally enjoyable experience. The staff were beyond awesome, the food was tasty and the bathrooms were clean. Next time I'm in Toronto, I'll absolutely be stopping by."}
{"text":"Amazing Caribbean food! We got fried chicken with garlic mash and salad, and jerk chicken poutine. The fried chicken was wonderful tender and juicy. Beware the spice - we ordered spicy jerk chicken and it actually was pretty spicy, so it's definitely not one of those places where you order \"spicy\" and end up with \"just above mild\". 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"i like the chicken waffle here. very delicious. staff are friendly. the restaurant is very small and seats are limited. You should come early to try their chicken waffle. I havent tried other items on menu so I can't give a straight 5 stars for this review."}
{"text":"We came for brunch this past Saturday morning and were pleased to find that all the great things people say about this establishment are true.

Prices were excellent and the portions were generous. It did take a little while to get our food, but you get the feeling that it's made with care and love. Kim did mention that she was training someone new. So a little understanding was not a problem for us. My Chicken and waffles were so delicious. I love both chicken and waffles, but I'm not a fan of overly sweet food. UTT, does a savoury version that was right up my alley. My partner's Prime Rib Benny was outstanding. Such great flavours and the hollandaise was outstanding.

In every review, you read how Kim, the owner is the best. She's very real, caring and so great at anticipating the needs of her customers. We will be back the next time we're in the neighbourhood, Kim. Thanks for the awesome brunch!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with friends. The owner is so nice! She is the most talkative and humorous restaurant owner I've ever seen, can't imagine how can she keep this level of energy and interacts with all her customers everyday.

I ordered pancakes. They are very fluffy and the dryness is perfect to me (don't like the ones that are too soggy). One of my friends had Waffle Chicken and my bf had Oxtail. I had a bite of Waffle Chicken, it tasted great but a little spicy; didn't try the oxtail but my bf said it was good.

Will try the Waffle Chicken next time."}
{"text":"Came here last year, November 2013, when they had just been open a few months. Best Canadian comfort food ever! And this is where I had Poutine for the first time in my life! Jerk chicken poutine...ugh, so good! The gravy sauce wasn't watery and wasn't too thick. The ox tail dinner...meat so soft, it fell right off the bone! The decor isn't super fancy smancy but that's not what you're there for. The music they were playing I loved! And the owner and cook even came out to chat with us. Made me feel very homey and comfortable there. I am definitely stopping in again if ever in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Caribbean food I've had. The food took a little longer than expected. Highly recommend this place, but definitely factor in a little more wait time because the food is cooked and prepared right after you order. 

Ordered the fried chicken poutine, oxtail stew dinner and jerk chicken dinner. Suggest trying to hot sauce but warning - it's a pretty spicy and a little Smokey."}
{"text":"Y'all. Gotta. Hit. This. Place. Up.

Had me putting my hands together like the 6 God himself. My girl and I are visiting from Atlanta, Georgia and as many southerners with some chagrin will admit, we have high standards with breakfast and brunch. If you find yourself in Toronto: GO. 

But it's no secret out here so...you should call."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food. I ordered the chicken parm special and it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place lived up to its expectations. We had the suggested jerk chicken and funnal cake which were fantastic. Amazing flavors, perfectly seasoned. The chicken was juicy and tender, and the pork and beans complimented the rice very well. The dressing and salad weren't bad as well which made the whole thing an amazing experience. As the waitress said, the funnel cake we ordered was a pretty big portion and great for sharing. I recommend this place to anyone visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Had a great first experience at Under The Table! Service and venue were both great! But more importantly, the food was great!  I had the best fried chicken (served with mash and corn) I've ever had! Quality and price were also great.  Will definitely be returning for the brunch menu."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Went for brunch today and was amazed how good it was. From the cucumber water to the chicken and waffles with egg on top. (hands down the best chicken & waffles I've had) everything was on point. And for the price an absolute steal. 

The staff there is amazing, very nice and good sense of humour. I can't wait to go try their dinner menu. 

I would give this place 6 star if I could. They need one of these on every corner. 

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great food. Cute/intimate space that feels like home. The owner was really nice and we ended up chatting with the guy sitting next to us. So thanks for a yummy meal and good conversation/friend. Price point is on point!"}
{"text":"Very unassuming restaurant. Would have missed it from the street view. Went here for brunch on a Sunday. And was intrigued by the Caribbean inspired menu. Really down to earth servers. Small but intimate dining area. Oh and did I mention the food is amazing!! Tried the jerk poutine and jerk chicken and waffles. Also tried the eggs Benedict. All delicious. An underground (under the table) cabbagetown gem I'd say!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and it did not disappoint! It is located in the worst area of the city, Cabbage town. A place where you can probably get stabbed walking down the crazy streets. A little hard to get to commuting via subway but maybe it's because I'm spoiled by car rides. This place offers UberEats along with some other delivering services, so if you do, I would suggesting ordering over the phone for pick up or UberEats. The restaurant is quiet small to dine in but it offers a comfy and authentic feel. 

On the menu, I have ordered their seafood deluxe or something similar. It was wonderful. Their ribs are also great, fall off the bone type of meat. If you are not a pork or seafood type of person, or any person, DON'T skip out on the jerk chicken and fried chicken. It is so juicy and tender, perfectly cooked along with some coleslaw. I believe this place is vegetarian friendly as well. And don't forget that brownie !!!!"}
{"text":"When I look down the aisle of tables and those that fill them, all I see is happiness.

People eating their food, engaged in conversation with not a care in the world, this to me are the tell tale signs of good food and great spirits.

 Although is was  it exactly honest here, the food wasn't good it was great."}
{"text":"My friend and I got food to go from there two weeks ago. From all the pics and reviews from Yelp we wanted to try out our old neighbourhood's new restaurant. 

The owner was really friendly but too many \"hun's\" and \"honey's\" for my comfort level just meeting someone. She was honest that the restaurant is a mix of foods not just Caribbean food (versus most of the Yelp reviews). 

Between us we tried the jerk chicken wings, poutine and dinner. The wings and poutine were great. The jerk chicken dinner was okay. We know better places for that. 

We plan on going back to try out the brunch, pirogies and their desserts.  It's a nice clean space. Kind of a rustic interior."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, perfect for couple dinner or dinning by myself. Very cozy, staff are very friendly, good music good food good vibes that's all I need"}
{"text":"This unassuming restaurant is neatly tucked away in Cabbagetown and serves up large portions of delicious food. We tried the seafood cakes, oxtail and jerk chicken  and all were fabulous. To top it off the service was excellent.  Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Where to start? The wings? The friendly service? The incredible value?

This really is a wonderful dive/hole-in-the-wall if you could ever pick one. Mostly below ground and seating for maybe 20-25 at best. The decor also looks pre-restaurant makeover. Hey, if keeping things the way they are is required to keep the prices low then I don't care. The servers are so friendly that you really get a \"where everybody knows your name\" vibe while there. In fact, they seemed to have regulars there, who didn't mind singing Whitney Houston and NKOTB aloud. 

We ordered 2 pounds of wings: one pound was the chef special, the other was a chipotle/maple. OMG, so delicious!  The chef special is a top secret recipe, and so you'll just have to try these - which may be the best I've had. They're the XL-sized wings, which have a nice crisp on the outside. It came with fries, which were fresh-cut, delicious and served with aioli. We also ordered a jerk chicken wrap (half the menu is Jamaican food - the chef is Jamaican) with a side of salad. The chicken was delicious, and coleslaw inside was pretty good - but the bread was so-so and could've used more sauce or even jerk gravy. I still won't allow that to bring down the rating however. We shared a chocolate cake pudding dessert which was also perfect.

The bill before tax and tip was under $30...seriously. Yelpers: a tip that when you check in you get 10% off your bill. Without a doubt, I'll be back...again, and again, and..."}
{"text":"On the hunt for brunch on a weekend, our very own Yelp suggested this as something in the neighborhood to try.  We left highly satisfied.

Like: Basically everything.  We were warmly greeted when we walked in and immediately pegged as first-timers.  The server came over to talk to us about the place and explain how she and her wife owned it, and tell us a little bit about the restaurant.  To be honest, I've forgotten her name but I'm assuming it's Kim based on other reviews.  She was so sweet to us the entire time and we really enjoyed talking to her.  The food was really tasty, a good size and incredibly affordable.  We lingered a little longer than normal after eating but never felt pressured to leave.

Dislike: I don't really have anything to say in this category.  You've got a partner run business with two women that clearly want to make sure you are satisfied.  And we were.

I would love to come back to this place again for dinner and check out some of the other options on the menu.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My previous brunch was so amazing I had to come back and honestly, dinner WAS EQUALLY AMAZING.

I just love how cheerful the owners are, cracking little jokes here and there and offering such delightful service. I ordered the jerk chicken dinner but asked for garlic mashed as a sub for fries and there were super nice about it. The chicken was so tender and delicious with the perfect amount of spice (I got mild because I'm a baby) where I got good kick out of it but it didn't cause me to profusely sweat (like I normally do, sadly). The garlic mashed was fragrant and flavorful and overall, my friend's dishes all received compliments as well.

I said it before and I'll say it again, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE, IT'S A MUST COME!!"}
{"text":"Good food for a reasonable price and nice people. So glad my friend showed me this place. I'll probably be here every week"}
{"text":"Came back to Under the Table for brunch, and wasn't disappointed! This time around it was less busy, so the service was more attentive than the last time I was here. This is a very cozy environment, and even the other customers are very friendly and inviting. It's not the type of place you come in to be pampered, but where you can get some of that friendly tongue-in-cheek banter with the staff and owner.

This time around they had a brunch special - poutine! Story goes that a regular requested that the kitchen make a poutine for them, and so the dish was created. Instead of gravy, the poutine had hollandaise sauce. There was also bacon and two eggs any way you want them. I put UTT's special hot sauce on it and I think it was the magical touch that made the poutine go from great to heavenly. 

Conclusion: thank you to the regular who made this request! I really hope the poutine becomes a regular item on the menu. 

Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Came on Sunday for brunch, but the restaurant was closed despite all signs indicating they are open on Sunday."}
{"text":"My friends and I really enjoyed our dining experience here! What a great gem to find in cabbagetown. Kim who greeted us was one of the best I've ever had serve me dinner. Why? Because it felt genuine, homey, and authentic. Not like a five star restaurant with very friendly and professional staff, but putting on a fake smile just for the tip you know? 

The food was very reasonably priced. My friends and I had the seafood platter and oxtail, both tasted great! The only thing was the sole which was a bit over salted. Dessert funnel cake was also great. No soggy dough and just the right amount of sweetness. 
Overall highly recommended. Visit if you have a chance when you're in he neighbourhood you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A new favorite Brunch place my boyfriend and I are dying to go back to!

The owners and staff treat you like family from the first second you come into the place. Great atmosphere and people. Kim (co-owner) is a wonderful host/server and she'll do everything she can to make your experience awesome! 

The food is always fantastic. We ordered the Prime Rib Benny and the Jerk Chicken Waffles. The jerk wasn't to dominating and just piquant enough and the waffles were light and airy. Can't wait to go back! Real soon hopefully."}
{"text":"Food was great, customer service was off the chains, and the atmosphere was very home-y. 

We were craving some jerk chicken and decided to come here because of the reviews. it's hard to spot the place because it's literally \"under\" so u gotta look for the signs! 

We ordered fried pickles and jerk chicken poutine as apps. Fried pickles was good, the poutine was amazing! The jerk chicken was tender and juicy with great flavours.

We also ordered the jerk chicken wrap, oxtail, meatloaf, steak, and the cheese lasagna. Go for the carribean dishes, they are packed with great spices.

The menu specials changes all the time which is exciting. With the food prices, it's hard not to come back! 

Shout out to Riley! Great waiter with a great sense of humour. Can't wait to come back to see Riley 2.0 :)"}
{"text":"A solid four star, maybe 4.5. 

Jerk chicken was excellent, tender, flavorful, and with the right kick. 

Oxtail dinner was also very nice, off the bone soft. The rice with beans had the right amount of juice in it. 

I didn't enjoy the Ackee and Saltfish as much. Like the Ackee texture, but it could probably use a little more Saltfish. The dumpling is too hard. 

Kim the waitress was indeed great. 

In summary, it is a nice little gem definitely worth a recommendation and return visit. 

Plenty of nearby metered street parking for a Friday evening."}
{"text":"Another jewel I stumbled upon. This one courtesy of Yelp. I wanted to dine here last night but I was exhausted and my body did not want to cooperate. Anyway,  I called to check on their Easter Sunday plans for opening. They were scheduled to open for brunch with the rest of the day up in the air. I was asked to call back on Sunday. Thankfully, they decided to open for dinner. I knew I was in for a treat when Kim, the owner I had been speaking to, greeted me with a hug.  This meal of oxtails washed down with happiness in a glass (their name but an accurate description) was just what I needed for my birthday dinner. Oh, and Kim gave me a hug on the way out."}
{"text":"Was here less than a week ago for dinner...and back again already =) But for brunch this time!

My sister had the chicken and waffles here not too long ago, and she loved it. So I figure, why not come back to try the brunch menu?

We ordered both flavours: triple maple berry and bacon maple dijon. I preferred the berry one. The sauces were just the right amount of sweetness. The fried chicken was fantastic. Crispy breading on the outside, super juicy and tender on the inside. Waffle's texture was like a mix between waffle and pancake. For some reason, I tastes a bit of bitterness when eating the berry one - not sure where that was coming from. 

Super filling! I would love to see more combo options here - like 'chicken and waffles two ways' so you can try both flavours at once. And for dinner, to have the 'combo special of oxtail, jerk chicken, and fish' as a regular item on the menu.

All in all, great food. Everything I've eaten here so far has been super tasty!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I came to Toronto for my birthday weekend in April. We were looking for Jamician cuisine and found Under The Table in the Yelp App. After reading the reviews we were looking forward to trying new food in Toronto. 

The food was delicious! I had ox tails and hubby had jerk chicken. We received plates FULL of food which we couldn't finish and ended up taking it home with us. Kim was very sweet. I liked the scenery with candles and dim lighting. Perfect for two. It is small and we did have to wait a few minutes for  seating but it was worth it. 

I recommend to anyone looking for Jamician food. This is the spot!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed by any of the meals I have had here.. always top notch quality and service. . Everyone that works there is friendly and knowledgeable.. The atmosphere is also very inviting and it feels like home. Good job!! Thinking about going there tonight.. : )"}
{"text":"I went with my friend on Saturday, supposedly for a brunch, but I had been craving for their oxtail plate, so I had an unorthodox brunch-the long awaited oxtail! My girlfriend got the Chef brunch, which she liked a lot. 

As for my oxtail plate, I enjoyed every bite of it, the coleslaw, the salad, the oxtail and the rice with beans, all is perfect except one tiny thing, the sauce is a bit on the salty side for me. However, I'm notoriously known for light taste, so it might just because of me. The hostess is super nice, will come back just even for her. 

I have passed this gem so many times without entering, given my workplace is so close to it, what a shame! But now, I'm delighted that I've discovered this charming place. In a word, the food and services are superb, but the weakness is its decoration and environment."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the high rating here....this is a tiny basement level neighbourhood grease spoon, with long wait times. Really, you can get the same in many other places...."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best place to grab a bite in Cabbagetown. Although the place is hard to find, the food is amazing! Everyone has to try the jerk chicken here - it's probably the best I've had."}
{"text":"Bruh. So damn good. 

That should be enough, but since your probably want more, I'll go on a bit. 

Great brunch! Obviously they don't take reservations, but my gf and I walked in one Saturday morning mid-December, and were seated right away. 

We were given tea and coffee right away and made small talk with who I believe is one of the owners. Her picture is by the door. Very sweet lady. She told us that they were working on a large catering order, so they may take a bit longer. I ended up having to interact with my gf. Oh no. 

We ordered the prime rib eggs benny and jerk chicken waffles and gaaaaaddamn so good. Cannot say it enough. The jerk chicken melts in your mouth. The flavours. Oh the flavours!

Ive been telling everyone I could about Under the Table, but thought I'd make it yelp official since I can't sleep right now. I hope you go. You deserve it."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. Went to this place in Cabbage Town on a cold October Saturday morning. Didn't look appealing from the outside but it's such a homely feel when you get inside. It's a bit hard to find. You need to go down the stairs. 

As soon as I walked in I saw a lot of people but the server approached me quickly and got a table ready. The service here was so friendly, personable and the servers just generally seem happy. 

I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Home Fries and Aioli for my dipping sauce. The Benny was delish with salmon and avocado and the creamiest Hollandaise sauce. The presentation was beautiful.

Happy belated birthday Kimmy!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 6 stars for this place.  It deserves 6++++ stars. We visited on a Friday night and were lucky to get seated right away.  We initially wanted to try the wings but they were sold out so we opted for perogies as an appetizer instead and fish n chips and oxtails for our mains.  My partner ordered their drink special which was eggnog with Kraken. It came fashioned with a cinnamon stick and went down smooth.  Our mains were equally as good. The oxtails were braised to perfection and fell off the bone.  The gravy was rich and savory. The salad with it was fresh and refreshing.  My partners fish and chips were excellent. The fish was thick cut and lightly coated in a malty crispy batter.  With it were hand cut fries that were nicely seasoned.  We took our perogies to go as we were pretty stuffed.  Once reheated later we wish we had ordered two portions.  The bacon used was smokey and fried to a perfect crisp.  Hands down the best perogies we have had.  

Cannot say enough good things about this place it's a true gem and offers up a warm friendly vibe.  We were newbies but noticed they have quite a few regulars.  Our server gave us first rate service throughout our meal.  

We are coming back to try the wings but will call first."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely stellar, even the wings which we only got as an appetizer were delicious. I chose the fried chicken dinner with the mash and wow, it was more than I expected. Even the funnel cake at the end was a delight. Waiter was super nice too. 

Portions are more than great for the price as well. This is one place that I definitely want to check out again and a place that I would recommend to anyone. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"My two friends and I were in Toronto for a quick weekend getaway and were looking for a quality meal without a hefty price tag. 

I yelped different types of food in the area and came across this little piece of heaven! 

We arrived by UBER and were a bit taken aback ( I must admit, I didn't look at very many pictures) as we didn't expect it to be a \"hole in the wall\", type of restaurant. We entered and were promptly greeted with a smile and given a table to sit at. Shortly after sitting down we were entertained by a local man who frequents the establishment. He was a lively character bursting with energy and humor. 

We checked out the menu and I was slightly disappointed that I didn't see any of the dishes that I associate with Jamaican food - curry chicken/goat and/or pepper steak. Not to worry though, a fan favorite, oxtails, were on the menu. 

Every time that I've had oxtails I had more fat than meat, so I was a bit skeptical ordering them, but I am so glad that I did! They were absolutely delicious and the meat came right off of the bone and with very little fat attached. The accompanying salad and rice and peas all made for a very tasty meal at an unbeatable price. 

My friends and I were there for a limited time and opted to take a few rounds of shots (shots, shots, shot, shots...everybody, lol). The woman who primarily helped us was awesome. She made sure that we weren't going to be driving and even dedicated a song to us, Keri Hilson's \"Pretty Girl Rock\". 

We had a wonderful evening at \"Under the Table\" and an incredible meal. 

Our experience and the obvious ratings remind me that often times a \"hole in the wall\" is the way to go for authentic food, great service and a good time. 

Much thanks to the owner and staff at Under the Table!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 1 lb chicken wing there and it was really good! The portion is good for me and it tastes delicious! Also the waiter is cute^"}
{"text":"This was the best meal experience of my life. I'll start with the important stuff: food was delicious. I had the oxtail dinner. The rice and peas were a little sparse and the \"salad\" left a bit to be desired but the oxtail made up for it. Fall off the fucking bone tender and juicy. I didn't leave as full as I'd like for 15 bucks but again oxtail was delicious.

So, why five stars? I had The Best time. I walk in and this woman is wearing a shirt that says I AM KIM. I'm thinking to myself, \"There's no way this woman's name is Kim.\" But sure enough I hear someone call for her. Then she tells me the story of how some random guy came into the bar and he met her and he sent her the shirt (he's from Utah or something insane like that) and so now she wears it every day hoping he'll come back into the restaurant and see her wearing it. No, I'm not making this up right now. The back of the shirt says LIGHTS IN THE HALLWAY. Why? Because the bathroom light is on the fucking hallway and she yells that at people when they go looking for it. 

She tells me this story as if it's the first time she's ever told it to anyone in her life, giant smile on her face, hanging on every detail. I ask, \"do people not ask about the shirt?\" Oh, no, they ask all the time. \"I just love telling the story!\"

Then she starts telling me the story of the restaurant, how she worked in customer service her whole life and opened a restaurant because she wanted somewhere that felt like home where people could get good food fresh without spending a lot of money. Then the jokes start. It's jokes about me, jokes about the staff, jokes about other customers, some of whom are clearly regulars but others who are like me and have no idea what is happening right now. Did I mention she does all of this in a voice that could be heard two towns away from us? Yeah. Everyone is cracking up, spitting food out of their mouths. Kim is laughing harder than anyone and I'm still trying to figure out what the entire fuck has happened.

Then the bus girl (super cute, by the way) comes and drops the check. They gave me 10 percent off my meal. Why? I don't know why. I didn't ask. I pay, tip 35 percent and get on my phone to figure out how to get home. Then Kim starts pouring drinks. 

She's been sober this entire time.

The cute bus girl walks out with a plate of wings. Kim says, \"At the end of the week I like to buy my staff a couple drinks and wind down.\" Oh yeah, they close at 7 o'clock. Post meridian.

I get my directions, walk out the door. On my way out, Kim shrieks, \"Byeeeeeeee!\" My heart. I melted. 

For a hot second I was in love and then I remembered that Kim told me her wife is the chef who made that bomb oxtail and I want no problems with a Caribbean woman who's good with the spice rack and a knife. Nope.

I have no idea what happened or if what I experienced was even real. This was 6 pm on a Sunday.

So, yeah, go to Under the Table, tell Kim you're from out of town and enjoy. You might just send her a shirt your damn self."}
{"text":"This review is only for the fact that we came here at 10:40am this morning and waited until 11:30 for them to open when they were suppose to open at 11am. 

Unfortunately could not try this place out. Spent $10 on an uber to come over here and from out of town, so definitely disappointed. 

When we left there was still no one inside to open restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I checked out this place over the weekend for brunch.  He got an omelette with bacon and a few veggies (plus side salad), and I got the most delicious combination of salty and sweet that I've tried as a vegetarian - blue cheese waffle with maple syrup and candied (and slightly spicy?) pecans.  OMG - so good, you guys.  I devoured every bit of those waffles to where the staff must have thought I was going hungry.  Additional bonuses: kind, sweet staff, a rockin' soundtrack, and no wait! Loved this place and will definitely be back - Under the Table is definitely a gem in Cabbagetown's delicious brunch scene."}
{"text":"The best food I had in Toronto....what an excellent find. If you are in the area you can eat breakfast, lunch and dinner here....in the same day (I'm not joking). I was with a group of friends in Toronto for the weekend and we found UNDER THE TABLE on Yelp. We were greeted by KIM who is probably the nicest person that we met in Toronto. For breakfast on Saturday we ordered the ROYAL FRENCH TOAST, BANANA PANCAKES and the SATURDAY SPECIAL (eggs, breakfast potatoes, toast, bacon) which were all amazing. They had no problem switching the bacon for a veggie option at no extra cost. We were so impressed that we decided to come back for dinner the same day.....yes you read that correctly. For dinner we ordered the PAN SEARED SALMON, STEAK SPECIAL and OXTAILS. We didn't talk much after the food came to the table.....you know what that means. Before we left we told KIM that we would come back the next day for breakfast. She laughed but we told her that we were serious. As promised we came back the next day for breakfast and ordered the same dishes that we ordered Saturday morning. Very good food and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Love this place! The interior is basic, but the atmosphere is great. I felt like coming home here because the owners are so welcoming and friendly. The spagetti bolognaise was simple but tasted great, spicy and fresh. A little more cheese on top would have made it perfect. Sometimes all you need is a simple home-cooked meal in a warm environment."}
{"text":"Very good food. Good portions.  Had the jerk and meatloaf.  The server was excellent.  Not too often you see people who are truly friendly like that.  
Meals take a while to come out so be prepared to wait a bit. We went with only a few customers inside and meal took 20min"}
{"text":"Not that under the table needs more 5 star reviews but this place is excellent. Everything the other reviews say about the jerk chicken is true and the specials are also great. I'm really surprised how not busy this place is whenever I've gone, most of the other restaurants with this kind of yelp hype have a super long wait time but I've found when I go I get seated right away."}
{"text":"If your visiting Toronto or if you live in Toronto make sure you eat at this restaurant. Take the time to venture to this little gem not on the main streets were real good food is prepared by someone that actually loves what there doing. Cooking great food is exactly what they delivered up. Eggs Benedict was cooked perfectly and the touch of avocado made it even more better. Since everyone's food was looking so good I need up ordering two meals the chicken and waffles was kick your mama good with the triple berry sauce. I'm going to steal their French toast recipe with sweet cream cheese in the inside probably the best French toast I've ever eaten. The food is great and the service was also great I believe the owner personally took the time to guide in menu selection. 


To the idiots that wrote jerk chicken wasn't jerk because it was catered to those that eat jerk chicken that live in the area. WTF do you want it to taste like, apparently you don't go in there often for them to cook to your taste buds."}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service, great people, if you ever come here to eat something let the waitress do the serving! They will definitely give you the best food you can get for a really cheap price. Make sure you get \"Todays Special\". Have No doubts if you're having the difficulty if this place for you they will definitely make you happy"}
{"text":"What a great first place to eat at in Toronto! Went here because of the positive Yelp reviews and they were all correct! This is a small establishment, but the staff is friendly and the service is good. I had the jerk chicken wrap and was pleased that you can pick how spicy they make the jerk because I am a spice wimp and was worried I wouldn't be able to handle it! They give you water infused with lemon or cucumber for the table too! And our waitress gave us 10% off our bill, we are not sure why, so it was more than affordable but would have been even without the discount!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome. We had jerk chicken and oxtail, and it was heaven. And the Kim's personality is just amazing!! Would love to give it a 5 star, but my bf said he saw a cockroach crawling thru, so... Other than that, everything is just perfect"}
{"text":"Come for the food, return for the service. One of the best spots in Cabbagetown. Super chill and fun ambience. Seriously, this place can't be beat, all of the servers are amazing and the owners are lovely."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I visited Toronto from Chicago. To be honest, all of the restaurants we visited prior to UTTR was blah, at best.

Let me tell you... this place is legit. You must get the chefs wings. Best wings I've ever had!!! And that's saying a lot. (We did medium spice).

I ordered the maple salmon and it was on point!!! My bf had the jerk chicken plate.... omg!! Amazing! 

Last, but certainly not least, shout out to Kim she was wonderful:) Excellent food, excellent service. It was the cherry on top of my weekend vaca:)"}
{"text":"Food  is good but not great nor special.
Interesting interior but very tight seating that spoils the ambience.
A bit of mixed bag but still a standout from many boring places.
But this place has a character.
If i could give it 3.5 it would be fair.
Would earn 4 with better seating.
Worth visiting in lieu of many chain places, more character and better value."}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for decades and I've been waiting for a restaurant that sold comfort food other than Cranberries. 

I was craving fish and chips and right there, in my face, was a sign that read \"Special Fish and chips $9\". Thank you universe! I went in and was greeted warmly. They serve everything from breakfast and comfort food classics to food you would eat back home (if your natal or ancestral home is the Caribbean). There are a lot of choices but its not overwhelming.

The fries were perfectly seasoned and the batter on the fish was just right. Score!!

Goodbye pizza pizza (Both of them on the same block), cranberries, subway AND Tim Horton's (Wait I take that back, I'll never say bye to Tim Horton's) I've found a new food spot!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place for brunch and we found this with many good reviews. So why not?
When we found the place I thought that there must be something wrong here. We've walked in and then other thoughts.. \"are we going to live? Is it safe? Do they serve food? Like real food? Is anybody home???\"
But then Kim showed up, lovely lady super friendly, explained the whole menu and we had a great meal. Very clean and tasty food with good portions. 
Still not the best atmosphere but a nice hidden treasure with quality food."}
{"text":"Not a place for traditional jerk, but I am sure they are good at their eclectic fare.... 

As a Scarborough boy raised on jerk chicken, rice and peas along with the 1 dollar patty on a corn bread lifestyle back in the day, I still get the craving from time to time.  Most times I am in Scarborough and I will hit up my known spots.  Today I was out shooting downtown and got the craving so I yelped this place.  Walking in the atmosphere was pretty chilled out; its on parliament and there are parking spots on the street outside. 

I was greeted by a friendly lady whom I asked for the menu and ordered some oxtail and jerk chicken to go with rice and peas.  Order was made fresh and all the while in my car the smell of the food was making crazy so I sped home!  

Sat down and made a ceremony of it, bringing out real plates and everything (normally I just eat right out of the styrofoam boxes cuz you know, it's just jerk take out). This was $20 worth of jerk, which is twice my normal spend so I wanted to give it the respect, you know?   

Anyway, long story short, the jerk chicken was average not as amazing as other reviews made it out to be.  The average spots known for jerk food beats this.  And the oxtail was the bigger disappointment, the flavors were bland, I guess I should have known, it's made for the community it serves I guess.   I hope the items I didn't try are good, as the service was excellent and the place looks fun for a visit; but I probably won't be going here for my jerk craving. 

tldr:  jerk didn't taste better than other places as the reviews made it out to be..."}
{"text":"Under The Table is a local neighbourhood restaurant located in Cabbagetown that serves comfort food along with a few Caribbean dishes. I have been meaning to try this restaurant to see if warranted all the great reviews on Yelp and a restaurant that serves  good comfort food and good Caribbean food in Cabbgetown, that really piqued my interest for some reason.

I got there on a Friday around 5 pm and was seated by Kim and one of the first questions I had asked, was how they ended up offering a few Caribbean dishes that really got good reviews since the majority of the menu specialized in comfort foods. Kim told me the chef is Jamaican, so that answered my question why the Caribbean dishes got such good reviews and it assured me the Caribbean dishes were authentic.

I attended up ordering one of the specials of the day which was a steak cobb salad and my companion ordered the oxtail with rice and peas.

Steak cobb salad ($12): The steak was tender and cooked to perfection. The salad was fresh and they had a great house dressing that came along with it.

Oxtail with rice and peas ($14): The oxtail was amazing, the meat literally fell off the bone and it had great flavouring. The rice and peas were good, moist but not too moist. The coleslaw was okay.

The service was great, Kim is very attentive, friendly and very knowledgeable.

Overall, Under The Table serves very good comfort and Caribbean food at very reasonable prices accompanied by great service and I can see why it's garnered such high ratings on Yelp."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Like really amazing! Which is a bit of a surprise because anyone can just walk past this place and dismiss it as not even worth stopping to check out. 

Don't walk by! Stop and check it out! You will not be disappointed!

We were here for brunch and we had their version of fried chicken and waffles--it was fried chicken and french toast. And it was delicious! :-)

The staff here were awesome too. Spent time to chat and ask us how we were. Seemed appreciative that we had come in. Treated us like they wanted us to be there. (Which doesn't always happen in other restaurants.)

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Oh my god. I thought I could handle spice. Sometimes I think I'm pretty good at it. This restaurant got me good and I'm looking for another chance to go back. Got the standard jerk chicken dinner. Let me tell you, you don't need the extra hot sauce yet. And if you do, be gentle with it.

The chicken was tender and nicely seasoned, hitting all of the right spots. I'm definitely heading back for the oxtail next time, which my friend had gotten. It's fairly small, so we were lucky to snag a seat on Thursday evening with a row of reserved signs beside our table. 

4.5/5 would jerk again."}
{"text":"We ordered the oxtail and jerk chicken dinner. Both were good. Very friendly staff. We came here on a Saturday around 4pm, and there were a lot of tables reserved. I would suggest you to make reservations first if you plan to come!"}
{"text":"Things I Liked:
- The most friendly service. I actually feel super guilty right now for giving them only 3 stars because they were so friendly. 
- The cute little slices of orange and lime they put in the house water. See how hard I am trying to return the kindness here?

What I didn't like:
- How crushed I was when I tasted my all-time favourite Caribbean dish, oxtail, from the no.1 rated place on Yelp. The dishes was overly salty and generally lacking in flavour (except for the salty kind). 

Protip: 
We let Kim know that we found her via Yelp and she gave us 10% off our bill. She might do the same for you ;)"}
{"text":"The place is a hole in (under?) the wall.
Oxtail soup is simply amazing
Had the jerky dinner and best jerk I've ever had.

Kim was a great server."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices. Portions are great and price is on point. Small space, so sometimes reservations may be necessary. Good jerk chicken if you want to try that."}
{"text":"Not living so far away from the gem of an eatery Under The Table restaurant on Parliament and Wellesley was a great experience. My jerk chicken was so juicy and flavourful. It was my first time there and I already felt the warmth Kim brought to her costumers and to the neighbourhood. Kids and locals come by for takeout and always leaves with a hug and a smile. It's a hard business to capture that small piece of the niche market but somehow I just truly believe that the locals will support kim and her restaurant as she supports her community. It was a true pleasure to have met you and totally support your tasty eatery. I truly meant it. I will be willing to teach you how to make creme brûlée in exchange for another piece of the best carrot cake in the city!"}
{"text":"Whenever I want some jerk chicken or oxtail and rice, this is were I'm heading.  It's soo good!  Just stop reading the reviews on Yelp and go eat."}
{"text":"This place is really as good as it is made out to be! We went for the lady friends birthday a month ago and every bit about it was enjoyable. The food was great and I had the toughest time picking my entree (just gives me an excuse to go back)."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch today and gotta say the owner/manager is really funny! But she is also really good with customer service and she didn't turn us away even though she had reservations, she made sure to advise us that her next reservation was for 12:30 and it was 11something at the moment which allowed us to be aware of what time we needed to be finished by. We ordered the chicken and waffles (again) and their royal french toast with the side of bangers (sausages). When our food was brought out...along came a plate of sliced avocados. She joked with me about reading my review and I have to say I felt really touched that she made the effort to bring me avocados. It was very sweet of her. My BF and I were really surprised at the avocados...like really shocked. The food was really good, I love the french toast bread and my BF loved the chicken and waffles. We love the homey atmosphere of the restaurant and the customer service makes you feel special. It's really hard to find places like this which will keep us coming back. Officially our new favourite brunch spot! One day we will come and try the lunch/dinner fare!"}
{"text":"My friend recommend me this place for ox tail but we came on Saturday morning for brunch . We ordered Soft Scramble egg and Chicken and Waffle . The service is good , and the food tasted fantastic . The soft scramble egg is very soft and better than we expected. Chicken and waffle is really good with bacon honey Dijon sauce. We will come back to try the ox tail at some point. 

Only downside is that the service is very slow and there is no A/C in the restaurant. So for a hot summer when we went, we were sweating quite a bit while eating ."}
{"text":"I was around the Bloor and Sherbourne area and this placed just popped up on my Yelp-dar!

Ordered Grilled Eye Rib Sandwich, crispy onions, garlic horseradish mayo with rice and peas topped with gravy.......DELICIOUS!

This place inst fancy and it's definitely not going to be on your radar but if you are in the area and you are feeling hungry, hit them up!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars I would. We came here after New Years and while the curb appeal was If'y at first the ambience inside was cozy, the staff was nice and helpful and the food was BEYOND phenomenal. We got the chef wings, fried wings, ox tails, fried pickles and jerk chicken. Not one piece was left on any of our plates. Pretty convinced everything on the menu is good. I could eat there everyday if I lived in Toronto!!!!"}
{"text":"breaking news: this place finally has a liquor license!

Review in short: Good food, fair prices, very friendly staff.

Review in detail: I had jerk chicken, and was impressed that it was all boneless white meat. Ordered french fries as a side and they were surprisingly good (looked plain, but had great flavour). The wife had a rib eye steak special and said it was good. Not really what I'd define as a memorable meal, but a satisfying hearty meal that hit the spot without any issues.
2 dinners and 4 bottles of import beer came to $53 after tax before tip."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but it could be a hit or a miss.  Not sure if it's timing or just the chef but there were times where the food was very good but there were times where the food was not cooked fully or prepared in a rush. There have been times also where I saw the waiter/waitress fight with one of the patrons.  It's a good food place so it's worth a try.

Food: 3/5, I've gotten the chicken/waffles very good.  The jerk wrap is a bit watery and not as good.  Some other people that came with me got the ribs and this is where we thought the food was done in a rush (not fall of the bone; rather, frozen to cook) 

Service: 2.5/5, it's ok but them fighting with patrons sometimes can be putting-off as you can hear the yelling.  They are not as attentive but I don't think this is a place that does that generally.

Ambiance: 3/5, not bad, very diner feel and home-y.

Price: 3/5, average around $15-20 per person. Nothing spectacular"}
{"text":"kind of empty on saturday afternoon at 5. but I wanted to check it out anyway. This place only has like 20 seats. I loved the oxtail and jerk chicken. very flavorful and you can substitute rice and peas for fries too. mm-mmm good. Will definitely come back and try other things on the menu! Kim was fun and very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a great small cute little spot... The people who work there are super friendly, You feel the whole place is like a family room!
Food... soo good! Had a seafood platter & pasta platter... and a brownie... All were great!
Would come back soon..."}
{"text":"I had super high hopes for this underground restaurant on the east side of yonge that I never venture out to.

My twin offered to take me to one of my bookmarked restaurants anywhere for my birthday present ^_^ So I picked one as far away from the west side of Mississauga as possible lol we belted in my nephew and mom and off we went for a mid day lunch. 

We had a fun time lifting the stroller down the flight of stairs as strangers looked on. Once we got in we grabbed the last open table (wheeee) and the owner came over all smiles with menus and said you need to try the ox tail soup it's amazing! We ordered 2 small orders amazing wished we ordered 2 large. I would have been super happy just having that soup for lunch, so full of flavor and jam packed with tons of ingredients. She said they change up the soup often but it's amazing sways good... I've decided to believe everything this woman says from now on.  

We also got the goat cheese salad, the dressing looked homemade and was served on the side with out us asking which was great! Then we followed up with some delicious bacon, fried onion peirogies!!! Heaven!!! The bacon was plentiful and the cheddar and onions added the sweet contrasts and texture with the sour cream and large potato peirogies :)

We ordered the chef wings which the owners aid was sweet, tangy and spicy... lol of course it was all of the above. The wings are a great size and the sauce really is finger licking good!

Lastly we over finished our full lunch with a jerk chicken entree. It was moist, fatty and full of flavor! A dry rub version of jerk chicken and served on top of jasmine rice. 

We are never too full for dessert so we ordered the chocolate baileys cheese cake topped with ice cream! Finished it off in less than 1 minute haha

The owner was joking and playful with us right off the bat and just over all great even though it was busy the whole time we were there.

My mom (who never really enjoys the non asian cuisines and I normally get the eye rolls for every new place I try to take her) was licking her fork clean and fighting for the last piece of every dish lol and she doesn't even like chicken. 

I'll be back for their chicken and waffles one time... wkd brunch ONLY :) thanks for helping me show my mom something new!

Btw the music rocked the whole time we were there, had to catch myself from bursting into song every few mins."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in Toronto. Their dishes are super delicious and filling. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff helped us make a reservation the night before my Saturday brunch with a group of friends. An inviting atmosphere, delicious food, reasonable prices and a cozy location puts this on my list of great breakfast joints. Will definitely be stopping by again."}
{"text":"I have heard about Under the Table for quite a while now, and I've always wanted to try it. However, the location was a bit outside of my regular 5km radius in the downtown core, so I've been putting it off for a long time.

At last, I had the chance to come here on last Saturday during Victoria Day weekend for brunch. It wasn't too busy when I went, probably because most of its regular customers were out at their cottages enjoying the long weekend. The waiter was very friendly and sat us down right away. At first, I thought the brunch menu seemed to be similar to any other brunch place I've ever been to. There were pancakes, waffles, omelettes, etc. I decided to order an omelette with cheddar, mushrooms, and green peppers. My boyfriend ordered the pancakes with bananas on top. 

When his pancakes came, I began to understand what all the fuss was about. The pancakes were huge and fluffy! I tried a bite, and the soft pancake almost melts in my mouth. It was absolutely delicious! Not to mention, the portions here are huge. It's definitely worth the price.

The service here is also exceptional! My order had a small mix up, but it was quickly corrected. The waitress (maybe she's the owner) still offered the meal to me for free. Overall, I really enjoyed my brunch experience here, and I will definitely try to go back more often."}
{"text":"Came in here based off the reviews and was definitely not disappointed. I ordered the french toast which came with creme cheese INSIDE the bread. Truly innovative. The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. The menu had a lot of different options, allowing you to order breakfast or lunch. Highly recommend you check it out if you want good food served with a smile!"}
{"text":"As a long time resident of Cabbagetown I make it a point to try all the new restaurants but this one provided a real surprise, don't let it's petite size and casual atmosphere fool you into thinking casual thought is going into what is coming out of the kitchen...because chef Betty will rock your taste buds with the most tender Jerk Chicken I've ever eaten. So, I thought I'd try again and was treated to beef ribs where the tenderest meat fell away from the bone. So I thought, ok, but does she over cook the pasta...nooooo perfect El Dante with a sauce to swoon over! This woman understands food and can serve it up in an unpretentious, friendly, neighbourhood location where everyone is made to feel like family, perfect !!"}
{"text":"Just visiting town for a couple of days and tried this place out, and I'm so glad i did. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, the coffee was great, every plate tasted delicious, and the cocktail really was happiness in a glass. I may have to take a second trip here tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great find!  I went here with my partner on Friday night for dinner on my way to a meeting.  He'd been there for lunch the day before with an old friend and he wouldn't stop talking about it.  We walked in and I was immediately hugged (a real hug) by one of the owners who was so genuinely happy to see that we were there.  They had Judge Judy playing on the big screen on the bar area as a regular customer was on his way in and he had pre-ordered his meal and mentioned he wanted to watch Judge Judy.  I was like \"WTF\" this is a bit strange but I quickly just gave in and went with it.  Very different from what I am used to, but the hug kind of solidified that too.  

We decided on the meatloaf which was presented like a sandwich.  One tasty slab of meatloaf, with a thick layer of delicious mashed potatoes and then another slab of meatloaf with the crunchy onions resting on top.  Lots of gravy and a side of mixed veg.  We had coffee and the most amazing funnel cake.  Note: Share the dessert... with two of us eating it, we still didn't finish it.  

The entire experience was very pleasing.  Great food, amazing service, the friendly atmosphere and the price point was more than fair.  I really felt that we had amazing value for our hard earned money.  

Will certainly go back... seems that most customers do.  They seemed to know everyone who walked in the door.  If you want a non-pretentious dining experience with some good old home cooked food, check this place out."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto and was looking for a restaurant that had Caribbean food but also had a kids menu - love this place - well priced, good food, super nice server."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. I really did. Food was mediocre at best, service was a bit slow (I think they were understaffed) and it seemed like a lifetime before food came out. The prices are a bit expensive for what it is. The jerk poutine was not that great (esp the gravy). The oxtail was good, but the side of rice and salad and slaw were both...mediocre.

I feel like I could get better oxtail and jerk chicken along Eglinton W. 

On the other hand, the owner was incredibly sweet and friendly."}
{"text":"Those of you who have read my posts know that I rarely give 5 stars and never give 5 stars to diners. This place deserves a 5 star rating. The hostess, waitress, manager - Kim immediately made me feel welcome even though she knew I had never been in before. This place is frequented by locals and she knew everyone in the restaurant - except me. No matter. Her service was friendly and efficient. I ordered the fried chicken and it was exquisite. The chicken was so tender and flavorful. There was nothing on my plate when I was finished. This restaurant is underground in Cabbagetown and a medium walk from downtown. It is extremely reasonable and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch recently on a Saturday morning with my wife. Little place that you'll probably miss but luckily they have a good sign so you don't miss it.Walk down the stairs and you'll notice that the place isn't too big. Few tables, a bar area and a tv screen. You're greeted by Kim who is one of the nicest person you'll ever meet calling you hun to make you feel welcome. She was also very engaging with my daughter who waved hi back to her.

We ordered their Prime Rib Benedict as well as their waffles. Never had a prime rib benedict before but definitely a plate to try if you come to this place. The prime was was cooked perfectly though I would've liked the egg to be runny though. Nevertheless good food and good service! Definitely a place to go to for brunch."}
{"text":"Attended based on YELP reviews as we usually go across the street to Cranberries. Same prices, lower quality food, definitely a basement atmosphere. Ordered the ox tail stew as per reviews. Moderately interesting flavor but definitely not fresh. Friend ordered a seafood plate that had no pizzaz at all, just fish on a plate. Will continue to hit Cranberries!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Been here a few times and had french toast, 30 oz rib eye & the fritatta. The rib eye is about $15 and comes with a 3 eggs and fries. It's not the best cut of meat, but it is delicious with it and hits the spot when you're craving for steak and want tons of protein.

My favorite is the Frittata so far. Loaded with tons of cheese and potatoes, you seriously can't go wrong with this. It's true comfort food here. I crave for it sometimes.

The owner, Kim is super sweet. I always show up after the brunch rush on the weekend and have only ordered from the brunch mine, but need to order Jerk Chicken Poutine next time. It looks amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, food was amazing and atmosphere was great. Very reasonable priced. Really worth the stars. I really love how they serve their Dishes with fresh salad which is different from a lot of other carribean places"}
{"text":"Maybe our expectations for this place were too high... After reading many positive reviews on yelp, we couldn't wait to try this place. 
We came here on Friday night for dinner (at around 7). The place was smaller than we thought, probably ten tables or so? It wasn't packed so we got seated right away. 
Both dishes we ordered (jerk chicken and oxtail) didn't have that much of flavor. The chicken was on the dry side, but oxtail was very tender. Generous portion, and it came out to be a very well balanced meal with salad and rice on the side. 

Overall, not worth making a trip just to eat here. If you are around the area and want to have a good amount of food, this will do. There was nothing memorable about this place."}
{"text":"We went for a Sunday brunch. I liked its super low key atmosphere. Unfortunately, I think the servers enjoyed that a bit too much. They seemed like they were high (looked it and sounded like it based on the number of times they asked the same question). They frequently had discussions between one another about billing tables and which tables plates of food would go to. They seemed to have a difficult time keeping track of people's orders, although they always ended up at the right place eventually.

I ordered fried chicken and waffles. They were quite good, except the waffles were more like pancakes. They weren't a miracle to write home about, but I was happy with it. My boyfriend ordered the Full Monty. As a fan of English breakfasts, I think he enjoyed it decently enough too. We were overall satisfied with the price and the quality of the food that came out. 

There wasn't a big \"wow\" for any aspect of the experience, but for its proximity to my place, I'm sure I'll give it a shot one more time. I'm hoping I went on an off day for them and this will become my go to place. I really want it to be better so that it can be. I'm rooting for it!"}
{"text":"This past Saturday it was my turn to pick the restaurant in our adventure of rediscovering places to eat with reasonable prices. This time I found a winner!

Tucked away below street level on Parliament street this little gems was a surprise from the moment we walked in the door.  In general I don't like 'basement' restaurants but the cozy and warm atmosphere assuaged my concerns. 

A surprisingly large menu, it took some time to choose, and while we poured over the choices we both enjoyed a cocktail watching what dishes were served to other tables and asking what they were. 

My partner had the jerk chicken while I had the fried chicken. When I ordered I asked how the chicken was prepared and I was a little put off learning that the chicken was skinless and boneless. For me fried chicken is all about the skin and bones. I was assured that I wouldn't notice the lack of my favorite bits and when my plate arrived I was a convert. It was amazingly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, the portion was large, we should have skipped the nachos so that we had room for dessert. The table next to us had what looked like a sumptuous dessert that left me longing. My partners jerk chicken (mildly spiced) was equally tasty, large and we ended up sharing our dinners they were both delicious. 

It's a busy place doing a lot of takeaway and despite that we didn't feel rushed at all. I'd like to go again, but our journey continues on, my partners choice is this week. 

The cheque was a surprise making our meal the most affordable one yet."}
{"text":"Wifey and I came here for brunch during May two-four and wanted to try a new place on the east end because we didn't want to deal with the throngs of people lining up for breakfast at the west end. 

We were greeted by Kim, who acknowledged my Raptors gear and started talking game 3 with me, and she was kind enough to walk me through the menu. Of course there are your safe choices, including a $5 Saturday breakfast special, but I always prefer the road less travelled, so I decided on the lamb sausage with curry lentils while my wife enjoyed the ittani. The waffles were amazing and the lamb sausage was bomb. I must add, though, that you have to ask for the ghost sauce, made from Scotch bonnets, if your stomach can handle the heat.

Some tips and points:

- amazing staff chat them up and don't be shy!

- little details like cucumber water and the coffee has special ingredients that bring out the coffee flavour, like cinnamon 

- if you like it hot, grab the special ghost sauce made from Scotch bonnets/habanero peppers

Thanks for reading and I hope you will enjoy this place as much as my wife and I did. We'll be back for dinner! Bottle up that hot sauce for me!"}
{"text":"Great oxtail!! On a hiatus from New York, visiting the cousin country - my friend and I decided to explore the good eats of Toronto!

Since this spot had such good reviews we decided to swing up to cabbagetown (why is it called that?). Our waitress with the accent was a great accent to the experience - super welcoming and she has an interesting accent (not the aboot type but apparently she's Nova Scotian)...

So my buddy ordered the jerked chicken w garlic mash potatoes and I had the oxtail w rice and peas... Man - it was on point... Oxtail was super meaty and flavorful - some plantains to too it off would've made it just right.. 

I def want to check out this spot when I'm back in town again."}
{"text":"Every time I've eaten at UTT, I've not only died and gone to gastronomic heaven, but I've had stellar service too. My goal is to try everything on the menu. So far, my theory is that the chef can do no wrong, whether it's stuffed French toast for brunch (to die for) or her fall-off-the-bone oxtail dinner. I am definitely a huge fan and owner, Kim and her staff, take so much pride in their place that they treat their guests exactly how they'd want to be treated. It's truly a gem in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the intimate, family feel of the place.  The jerk chicken was very tasty ( could have used more sauce ). The owner / bartender was great. Aol-around good experience."}
{"text":"Let me begin this review by saying that Kim, the waitress at Under the Table, is quite possibly the greatest waitress I have ever encountered in my life. Even if the food wasn't spectacular, I would give this restaurant a favourable review just because of the amazing service/warmth that I received from her. You go, Kim.

But this isn't the case, seeing as the food also does happen to be spectacular! I had the steak. It was super flavourful, perfectly cooked, and was delivered with love from Kim.

Try this place out! You definitely won't regret it.

Also, did I mention how awesome Kim was? Because she is just lovely."}
{"text":"What a hidden jewel in Toronto and since I've left I am still having dreams about the drinks and food.  The location is hard too find and is somewhat small, well intimate but once your in and start with a refreshing cocktail that will eventually sneak up on you you will be happy happy joy.  The menu was so hard too choose from but since I was here for a day I had to pick the right appetizer and entree.  I choose the jerk wings and chicken and waffles.  What great choices.  The jerk wings were perfectly marinated and served with a side of celery and carrots.  I could have eaten ten more and just sat at the bar with a few more drinks.  The chicken and waffles with the maple reduction and a side of fruit was one one of the best waffles I've ever had, perfectly cooked and flavorful.  The chicken had the right texture and flavor and had me clamoring for more.  If your ever in Toronto try this place and being from the south I'm a chicken connoisseur."}
{"text":"Wowwww what a wonderful place, the girls make you feel like you are part of the family as soon as you walk in, I have never like BBQ sauce, my husband got the ribs and holyyyyyyyyy, that BBQ they made was just divine! I got the jerk chicken wrap and it was soooooo delicious, the chicken was so fresh and tender, the best part the serve huge portions and the prices r so affordable, we r definitely going back and telling all my friends about it."}
{"text":"I was really hyped for this place, given the amazing reviews on Yelp, but I guess I set the bar and expectations too higher. We came for dinner and I had the oxtail dinner while my friend had the signature salad. The oxtail fell right off the bone, but I found the dish a tad too salty and strong in flavour. The salad was very well done, with mango, almonds, grilled chicken, and a tangy cranberry sauce. The speed and quality of service did leave something to be desired though, we found service quite slow and had to flag down a waiter for something. Contrary to other Yelp experiences, I didn't find my server friendly, if anything she seemed more pushy and annoyed.

It is a small restaurant, with around 20 seats, so if you're coming in a big group, or just to be on the safe side, I'd say make a reservation beforehand. Also, they have a black curtain/cloth right behind their door, which makes it look completely dark inside the restaurant when looking in, so just push the door to come in, even if it looks closed and dark inside!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Kim (I think she is the owner) made us feel like we were her friends not customers. We had hamburgers, fried chicken dinner and Betty's jerk chicken wrap.  Absolutely perfect. Everything was juicy and tender.  We also tried the funnel cake.  Wow!! I only wish I ordered more then one as it was gone within 5 seconds. Not a good idea to share it lol."}
{"text":"Best oxtail I've had in Toronto thus far. It's soooo moist fall off the bone and the portion size was huge. Really reasonably priced at $16

It's a small place and when I came at around 7pm on a Friday night. We were the 3rd table to arrive but boy did it fill up fast.

The service was great too, friendly and quick and the server really seems to know food. 

Highly recommend!!

Can't wait to come back to try the jerk chicken."}
{"text":"A friend highly recommended Under The Table saying they have one of the best Jamaican Jerk Chicken & Oxtail Stew at a reasonable price. Then I checked Yelp and found glowing positive reviews from fellow Yelpers so this really piqued my curiosity to check this place out as people are giving 4 and 5 stars.

And boy we're glad we did coz by far this is one of the best jerk chicken and oxtail stew  in downtown Toronto! We tried Rasta Pasta and it doesn't even come close to the deliciousness that Under the Table offers.

Located in the heart of Cabbagetown, it's hidden below street level and a hole in the wall. The place is also dark and dated but don't let that stop you from coming and checking inside the restaurant. The owners and the staff are the most friendliest bunch we've ever encountered. Service is also 5 star, you know everyone who works here love what they're doing by how well they treat their customers.

And the food, OMG, the food here are heavenly! The Jerk Chicken is so addictive - it's smoky, moist, sweet and spicy. It's not the normal jerk chicken leg you find in other restaurants. The dish comes with bite sized jerk chicken, rice and peas, salad and a delicious coleslaw.  The oxtail is also fall of the bone tenderness - a satisfying stew perfect for a chilly day.  They also give you homemade hot sauce which is amazingly good and spicy.

And the best part, the prices are so reasonable. Can't wait to come back and try other dishes from their menu."}
{"text":"While on a quick visit to Toronto, we wanted to patronize a breakfast place that offered a neighborhood atmosphere. If you're not familiar with the place (and are totally reliant on gps for directions), remember to look \"down\" as some businesses are located on the basement level of buildings hahaha.

We were so glad to find the place...warm greetings met us at the door and the genuine hospitality continued throughout the course of our dining experience. The menu can be a bit daunting...so many choices and it was hard to choose. Our server was very sweet and advised us to choose what our eyes gravitated to. With that direction, we were soon feasting on the lamb sausage and the chicken and waffles! Perfect choices for a late cold morning breakfast."}
{"text":"The meatloaf plus mashed potato were tender and tasty. The jerk chicken. Dinner also very very good. Very big portions and food is still great quality. I especially enjoyed the laid back atmosphere. The staff were all very welcoming and gracious. Definitely a favorite."}
{"text":"Stopped here based on the great Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. The manager/owner(?) Kim was lovely and friendly and helped us tailor our order to get the best tastes of everything. Not only that, she went the extra mile to make sure we got the most value for our money and helped us restrain ourselves from ordering everything on the menu (which we wanted to do) Definitely order the Chef's Wings, they are AMAZING! The icy cold water even had cucumber slices in it. The other patrons were clearly regulars and were friendly and pleasantly eclectic. We also happened to stumble in on karaoke night which was wildly entertaining (props to Jerry).  If we didn't live in another country we would make karaoke night and a chat with Kim a weekly event. Highly recommend based on the delicious food, great value, and friendly customer oriented staff."}
{"text":"ugh, so good. came here for late and ordered the poutine and dinner specials which were lasagna, shepherd's pie, and fried chicken with mashed potatoes. everything was so delicious. so freaking good. if i didn't live 280 km away i would come here like every day! can't wait till my next trip back to toronto to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Very good food, will come back definitely. We had half chicken and oxtail, taste fantastic."}
{"text":"After I kept hearing about this restaurant and reading the great reviews I finally managed to organize a brunch date with my girlfriends to check this place out.  Boy am I glad that I did because it certainly met up with my high hopes.

It's not a fancy place by any means but it certainly delivers on food and service!  We went for brunch around 11am on a Saturday and it was about half full...but an hour or so later there was a line at the door so make reservations or come a bit earlier.  

First the restaurant is located down some stairs in case you are trying to find it.  Don't be expected to be blown away with the decor - it does look dated but who cares if the food is good..right?

I'm assuming the owner Kim was the one serving us that day and she is a pleasant delight!  Genuinely a nice person.  I ordered the lamb sausage with the curry lentils and the scrambled eggs dish.  I also had their brunch special drink which is all kinds of delicious  - it's mixed berries with chardonnay with coconut juice and some other good stuff in there.  It's an absolute must have delight.  The lamb sausage was delicious and a big portion (not some shriveled up piece of meat) and it wasn't that typical game-y taste to it.  The curry lentils was lovely and I scooped them up with the bread that comes with your dish.  I can't comment on the eggs because I don't really like eggs but since it came with the dish (most brunch dishes do) I just left them.  It does take a bit of time for the dishes to come but I think they are making them fresh - not like some other places that make them before hand and then just warm them up.  

I'm looking forward to coming here again but this time to try out their dinner menu!  The oxtail seems to be a favourite and I'm looking forward to another great meal.

{"text":"This is one of those places where YELP makes a lot of sense..
I've worked near UNDER THE TABLE for 6 years; never been, or really noticed it.
Staff is super friendly, jerk chicken very good.  
Easy to understand all the regulars."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast spot! We ordered the prime rib eggs Benedict which was delicious, but the chef's breakfast with the fried chicken was incredible. Ask for their spicy sauce on the side to dip the home fries in. Super flavorful with a spicy kick. Definitely would come back here!"}
{"text":"We happen to stop in on Saturday around 2 p.m. and they were only serving brunch. We sat there for a minute and decided if we were going to stay or not. I am so glad that the waitress convinced me to stay. I ordered the Jerk Chicken and Waffles with a little heat. Delicious. My mom ordered the meatloaf, garlic mash and two over easy eggs. Yes, that's what was written down. We thought \"okay we skipped breakfast so this will work, half breakfast, half lunch.\" Wow, it was so good. Every single employee gave top notch service. The place was clean, the dishes were clean and the food was great! We wanted to go back the next day because we had an awful meal for dinner but it was getting late and we had to get on the road. The next time we visit Lauden we will be back."}
{"text":"Best Caribbean food I've tried so far. Have to wait longer for the food to be served, though. But, worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great comfort food and great service. Loved the jerk chicken. Pumpkin pie and the brownie were amazing !!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. The service is okay. They're great about filling your water, but not so much with the management of tables.

I had brunch there. They had a jerk chicken and waffles special and fried chicken benny on the menu. Both were great, but the fried chicken benny is one of the best benny's I've had. Top that off with an amazing, if not discernibly lemony, hollandaise and I was a happy camper."}
{"text":"Great experience! Kim welcomed us at the door as we walked in and everything about her said 'I love my job'. I ordered the pulled jerk chicken which was great. The service is indeed what makes this a 5 star instead of a 4. I would go again if I am in Cabbage Town"}
{"text":"Ok,  so on Saturday March 3rd 2018 around 11:00am my husband & I, and his cousin and Lady had one of the most friendliest, joyful, humorous & welcoming experiences here at Under The Table! We're from Nyc & came to Toronto for the Romeo Santos concert for the weekend, and I yelped a few places prior so that we'll have an idea of some places to go to, and oh I'm so glad I did!  It's a little hard to find the place, but if you pay attention you'll find it. It's below ground level, A small little Gem, a quaint spot. So if you're blessed to come at just the right time you'll have a spot, because it gets pretty packed.  So as we entered we were greeted by a very friendly young fella and seated quickly.  We were given refreshing water with lemon & my hubby went for some Coffee as well which he was raving how he liked the flavor!  The friendly fella which I wish I knew his name, was on top of our refills! Our waitress/Owner Kim came and introduced her self and gave us menus. Very friendly and bubbly, didn't rush us at all told us take our time if we had any questions about the menu to just ask. We took some time looking over the menu, because EVERYTHING sounded yummy!  We couldn't make up our minds what to get. So we finally decided . We had the Ox Tail dish with a side of Fried Breast Chicken, Prime Roast Benedict, Jerk Chicken Waffles, and the Lamb Sausage with Curry Lentils.. Our dishes arrived in a timely matter. They put our dishes on the table with a home made hot sauce as well. A little bottle of homemade Yummy Fire! Lol..  so here goes, we go and taste our dishes and Omg F**ken yummy, so yummy we all started tasting each others dishes, and all you hear is oh wow... Kim came by several times making sure we were good, and oh boy were we... lol.    We all scarfed our plates clean!  Kim came by & conversed with us & asked where we're from and occupations, small talked & had us laughing!  Gave us hugs and all!  Just A Beautiful person!  We left very satisfied with the food & service!  I feel like taking a trip up again in the future just to stop by here..  For me to write this much on a review, it must be good!! Bottom Line Come to Under The Table, you will NOT be disappointed!  Thanks Kim!!! Xo"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing. Since I'm a vegan my restrictions are hard to meet but the chef did an awesome job of coming up with a great, customized meal. My friends enjoyed their jerk chicken  and fried chicken  meals. The owner was so sweet, definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant with tasty food served by nice staff ! ! My friends and I spend almost 40 mins walking to have dinner. We still felt so happy because of the comfortable food. 

The restaurant's name is Under the Table and the location is just under the floor. You have to go downstairs and then find the door. A little easy to miss.  

The staff was very friendly. She told us about daily special and recommended some popular dishes. I have read a lot on Yelp so I ordered the Oxtail dish and my other two friends chose the special steak and jerk chicken. All of three meals are good and in great portion... The oxtail was stewed very well, tender and flavorful. Steak was well done but not dry. I love the side dish salad and coleslaw, and the rice with kidney beans in oxtail sauce are really die for.

Prices are not very expensive. Quite good overall. We still expected to have their brunch dish- waffle and fried chicken."}
{"text":"Comfort food restaurant not just a Jamaican restaurant as verified by the owner. However I still wanted to try their Jamaican dish since it was the most popular amongst yelpers. The food was amazingly good. Wanted to try more but I had no space to indulge. Owner was nice as well."}
{"text":"What we had: jerk chicken poutine, ox tail dinner, tiramisu cake

Taste: 9/10

The food here is flavourful and if that's not enough they provide a hot sauce with a great kick. I was a little worried that the jerk chicken would be dry, but it was not dry at all! The poutine was solid and I particularly enjoyed it with their hot sauce. 

Steven had the oxtail dinner, which was good in terms of flavour but the oxtails seemed to be overcooked. Some of the oxtails were hard to chew and a little dry on the inside. The rice was really good with the hot sauce. Did I mention their hot sauce is delicious? Haven't had hot sauce like that in any other restaurant. 

Tiramisu cake was good but didn't actually have any coffee flavour so it was really just... a slice of cake. Didn't seem to be made in house. The funnel cake that everyone is raving about in the other reviews wasn't available when we went. Wanted to try that out.

They serve water with cucumber in it so it tastes refreshing.

Value: 7.5/10

I forgot the prices of the individual items, but I do remember the total price. 

**Average cost per diner: $20 after tax and tip 

Service/Convenience: 8/10

This place has a sign facing the street, but you would have to go down a flight of stairs to enter the restaurant. The inside of the restaurant was not very spacey and tables are packed closely together. We were lucky that we went in the time that we did, because we took the last non-reserved table. This place gets packed FAST.

When we entered, we were felt a little misplaced as the server at the counter did not try to engage us. It felt like we had to make some effort to get her attention at first. Once we did get her attention, she seated us quickly and took our orders quickly. As she was taking our orders, she seemed to be very distracted by something. 

Our food came after a long wait that day. The owner later explained that it was due to their delivery person being late and throwing a tantrum when he was confronted about his tardiness, so I won't hold that against the restaurant. That was why the owner and likely the server were so stressed.

The owner was nice and she even gave us an extra slice of tiramisu cake on the house as an apology for the wait. :)

Would go back? Maybe, this restaurant is fairly out of the way for us but we might come back when we're craving solid Caribbean food.

Would recommend to friend? Yes, if they enjoy Caribbean food.

Similar places: None that we know of.

**Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza"}
{"text":"After convincing a friend a couple of weeks to try out lunch at Under The Table but not being aware that this restaurant was closed on Mondays, we braved it there today and our quest was rewarded with a quiet, pleasant lunch at this foodies favored downtown eatery.
My friend had one of the day's specials, a Cheeseburger with a crowning amount of near crispy bacon and a side of thick-cut bracelet sized onion rings that came with what I could assume as the UTT's own version of ancho-mayo as a dip. I don't ever remember properly tasting Jerk Chicken anywhere in Canada so curiosity got me to choose the Jerk Chicken Meal as a \"hmm, there's jerk chicken on the menu, must order it and maybe I will like it\" introduction to the dish. And I was glad that I order it. The amount of spice in the chicken seemed moderate enough that I did not feel it at the tip of my tongue and only as I continued chewing the meat. Not one biteful got me to quickly take a sip of the coffee to tame whatever degree of spice was present in the meat. Which means that I will now be opting for the Jerk Chicken if I ever go to a Caribbean restaurant at another date. As a Caribbean influenced dish I do wish that it was served with Rice and Peas since I've come to like this rice dish that I only trust Caribbean eateries to be able to prepare to properly. The flavors from the jerk chicken would go so well with it.
I'm a big sucker for onion rings and I'm glad they were served with the burger, so when my friend got me to try one of his onion rings I was happy with the crispness of batter coating.
Recently, I seem to have gotten into the habit of eating about half of the food on my plate and taking the rest home, which only means that I liked the meal and want to continue savoring it the next day :-) 
Oh, and the pictures speak more for themselves."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner without being told where I was going - entered the restaurant and realized there isn't the restaurant name anywhere to be seen haha 
It's a very cozy and homey environment at Under the Table. 
Ordered: 
Seafood soup - yummy! a lot of ingredients were used.
Sheppard's pie - love love the cheese on the top.
Jerk chicken & rice - the sauce for the rice was SO good.

Overall, I'd recommend this restaurant for those who'd like cozy comfort foods :) 
Service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"After seeing great reviews, two of us went late Sunday morning to try it out. The small restaurant was full, but I asked if we should wait, put our names down, come back in an hour or so? An \"I don't know\" with a shrug was my response. I left feeling a bit defeated without any information to work with. Even a, \"maybe try to come back on a weekday\" would have helped. It doesn't seem like they struggle to get business, but the utter nonchalance was really off-putting. We ended up going to the 420 Smokehouse (a BBQ joint) down the road for a huge portion of chicken and waffles and a delicious pulled pork eggs Benedict-- and it was empty! If you have the same issue I did, check it out."}
{"text":"We are first time visitor to Toronto and Canada for that matter, we love jerk chicken as it reminds us of our vacations in Jamaica and really wanted to find se on our trip.  This place is unassuming and warm, very down home vibe which we loved.  They were packed (the only hold 30 people so it fills up fast) so we had to sit at the bar, we both ordered the jerk chicken and loved it! We also talked to the owner who was very nice and you could tell she was passionate about her restaurant.  We even got a funnel cake on the house to celebrate our 5 year anniversary.  It was incredible by far one of the best desserts we've ever had, so simple but so crispy and full of flavor with fresh berries.  I highly recommend this place of you are looking for real food and really good arrive from real down to earth people."}
{"text":"Kim was fun to hang out with. And the food was great. We were told the oxtail sold out fast, so maybe we should call ahead of time before visiting Toronto :)"}
{"text":"First time here, both Servers were amazingly friendly, both went through the menu with us and recommended their favorites. It's always a good thing when you can't decide what to eat at a restaurant because you want to eat them all!!! The starter wings were delicious with a tangy sauce and I normally don't like saucy wings. They were crispy and fried to perfection with the sauce tossed while they were fresh out the fryer so the sauce stuck nicely. My jerk chicken dinner was a generous size with good flavors and my husband's jerk salad was also appetizing with fresh fruits. We were skeptical in the beginning since the price was economical so we thought the quality would take a dive. But overall, we were blown away by this neighbourhood jem. The Servers and Chefs came out to chat with the tables, which created a jovial and inviting  environment. You can tell this restaurant is successful and well loved by the neighbourhood because it had such diversity with different age groups, gender and races. Will definitely return and get take out from here again"}
{"text":"Very charming little hole off the street on
Parliament. Been there a couple of times and have been tempted by the waffles but to date have only had steak and eggs.
Great date spot."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the door we were greeted by Kim, who was super sweet and made us feel like family. Kim sat us and made amazing recommendations for drinks (happiness in a glass). After disclosing we were from NYC and of Caribbean descent we ordered the oxtail. Kim brought over \"pepper sauce\". This is hot just hot sauce this is the real deal that taste like someone's granny from back home make. The pepper sauce just added to the already flavorful oxtail. The food was so good. This is a MUST do if looking for authentic Caribbean food in Toronto"}
{"text":"Cute little place where locals frequent and knew waitress by name. I got the jerk chicken salad. Chicken super tender and moist. It tasted amazing with grilled pineapples and mangos in the salad, that comes with a homemade vinaigrette. Husband ordered the pulled chicken sandwich with ox tail soup. Soup was great, but the chicken was quite dry. 
Will definitely come back again for anything with jerk!"}
{"text":"Really great home cooked meal!  Kim was very welcoming and knew we would appreciate different music as soon as we walked in!  I had oxtail and hubby had the fish - we both really enjoyed the food.  The interior is basic, and the place is quite small.  The food is delicious, the hosting incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the prices were very wallet-friendly!  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"It is a story of what happens when an accomplished chef collaborates with the ultimate foodie; the marriage is something special.   They feature innovative daily specials and have a proven menu that keeps them returning.   Both the atmosphere and waiter are warm and engaging.   Under a the arable has a great Community conscience and is a hidden gem in Cabbage-town."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've never been to the Caribbean and I've never had good Caribbean food in my hometown Boston.

After learning that Toronto has a significant Caribbean population (thanks, Drake!), we knew we had to try authentic Caribbean food during our visit last weekend. We arrived at Under the Table around 9PM on Friday evening and managed to snag the last table for two. We shared the chef's wings (medium spicy), the signature oxtail dinner (with rice and beans, salad, coleslaw) and the jerk chicken (mild) with waffles. Everything was SO GOOD. The wings were crispy and saucy. The oxtail was stewed very well with fall-off-the-bone texture and incredible flavor. The jerk chicken was moist and the waffle was buttery and fluffy. Portions were generous for the price too.

Service was very friendly but a little bit on island time if you know what I mean. It was a mix of an older crowd (locals) and some tourists. Halfway through dinner, it was Karaoke Night with patrons singing oldies but goodies, which provided brief entertainment. Under the Table is a bit out of the way from the city center, but definitely worth visiting!"}
{"text":"This place is hidden and the seating is basic however, they serve a great brunch! The service is EXCELLENT! Our water and coffee was always filled. 

They serve really great classics/comfort foods. I ordered waffles with berries and my friends ordered eggs and fried chicken and everything was really great. Also, the price is so reasonable!

We will def be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing Poutine, even more amazing seafood pasta and best most fun, down-to-earth service.  Come on Thursday Karaoke night and enjoy a perfect evening before heading out of town to typically more boring US restaurants"}
{"text":"Okay first, let me talk about my experience. On our last day in Toronto, we decided to come here for breakfast/brunch on a rainy Sunday and it was absolutely packed. After seeing that there were no more tables available we decided to sit at the bar. Although we did wait a while for our food, we completely understood that it was a very busy day and didn't mind at all, especially because one of the waitresses (who is actually the owner) was so kind to us the entire time. She continuously expressed to us that it usually doesn't get so crazy packed and apologized greatly for making us wait. She even gave us our food for free for making us wait so long (even though we were ready to pay the bill and leave a generous tip for her kindness and delicious food). When we were getting ready to leave she gave us both a hug (super cute) and wished us a safe trip home. 

Now, the food. To put it in the most simplest form, it was amazing. It was absolutely delicious. I had the eggs benedict and my lover boy friend had the big breakfast (which included pancakes, eggs, bacon and home fries). 

I would definitely come back here and recommend it to anyone who's in Toronto. I cannot express enough how grateful I am to have come across an establishment that is satisfying in every aspect possible from the food to the hospitality."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! A must try when in Toronto. Kim is incredibly welcoming and makes you feel right at home. Food is delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just had lunch here and the service, food, and ambience was amazing! Loved the music selection too. I had the jerk entree and my husband had the salmon and shrimp sandwich; we enjoyed every bite to say the least. 

Lastly, Kim the owner welcomed us the minute we stepped in the door, spectacular service. :)"}
{"text":"This place is really good! Would recommend for sure. 

My mom had the oxtail dinner and she said it was delicious and falling off the bone. It was served with rice and peas, a perfect side! 

Delightful service and friendly atmosphere. 

This place can be a bit hard to find, there is a sign, but you have to look carefully. I now understand why they are called \"Under The Table\", because there are stairs going down leading to the restaurant.

Very good restaurant. Will be back."}
{"text":"This is a perfect example of how a restaurant should be operated. 

Amazing customer service from the second you walk in. 

Beautifully crafted menu with fresh delicious ingredients. 

I ordered the Prime Rib Benedict for breakfast and it was to die for. 

This place is fantastic."}
{"text":"We tried Under the Table for the first time tonight after reading all the rave reviews. It did not disappoint! We had the jerk chicken dinner and oxtail dinner. Seriously the best we have had. We were looking forward to meeting Kim and she was exactly as other reviewers have described. We will definitely be coming back soon to try out the rest of the menu (although it will be hard not to keeping ordering the jerk chicken and oxtail!). We hope to meet Betty next time. It's too bad we don't live in Cabbagetown anymore."}
{"text":"I came here upon the recommendation of a friend but I have to admit, I had a misassumption about the menu. I thought I was coming to a Jamaican restaurant, serving all the classic Jamaican dishes and more. Instead, they serve mostly Canadian comfort food with a few Jamaican dishes, such as Ackee and Saltfish, Oxtail, and a few Jerk Chicken variations. They also have an all day brunch menu. The chef is Jamaican.

I had the soup of the day, which happened to be beef, and the Oxtail dinner. The soup, although not the Jamaican style that I was hoping for, tasted pretty good. It had a lot of substance, the way I like my soups, instead of a watery broth.

The Oxtail (15.00), served with rice and peas and salad, was a very generous serving. It was fall-off-the-bone tender and rich with flavour. Very good. I would order this again.

The atmosphere is cozy, the service is good, and I enjoyed the food. I would consider coming here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best jerk chicken and oxtail in the city. I also love how friendly the people are in here. Definitely will come back for more spicy tender chicken and those oxtails that melts in your mouth (so tender!!)"}
{"text":"So glad my friend suggested this restaurant for dinner! The food was so good and so was the service! We ordered the jerk chicken poutine, salted fish and ackee, and oxtail dinner. All were delicious! The jerk chicken was flavourful and juicy. My favourite was the oxtail, perfectly cooked. I have my eye on the mussels in curry for my next visit. It was constantly busy while we were there for an early dinner on a Saturday night. It is a small restaurant, so I suggest making reservations."}
{"text":"We visited a couple of months ago on a Saturday around 12:30 PM, going out of our way to walk from Union Station to this place (35 minutes at a leisurely pace!) and overall, while I was really excited to visit this spot after reading the glowing reviews, personally, it was only slightly above average and wasn't a total 5 for me. 

We were seated promptly by, who I can only assume, is the famous Kim (although she wasn't as overtly friendly the morning we visited - she later mentioned that she had a cold and wasn't feeling too well). We ordered: a) the chicken and waffles topped with crispy bacon and maple berry sauce ($13.00), and b) the Sunday Special eggs benny with avocado and smoked salmon ($9.00). The chicken and waffles were decent but a large portion of it was dark meat the morning we visited, which I'm not personally a fan of. The waffles themselves were crispy, fluffy, and I actually ended up liking the waffles more than the actual meat! The eggs benny was fine, if not a bit salty, and the home fries were nothing more than your usual seasoned potatoes. Overall, the meal was pretty ordinary (aside from the insanely delicious waffles!).

Seating is minimal, so call ahead and book a reservation. If we're ever in the area again, perhaps we'll stop by and try out the other menu options, but we won't go out of our way to try it out again like we did for our first visit. 

For two people, with tax and tip, our total came to around $28."}
{"text":"It feels great when yelp introduces you to places like these. We were looking for a place to have brunch and decided to give this a try. The food is absolutely amazing and the ambience perfectly complements it. We tried out the rib eye steak and the salmon eggs benedict. Both were mouthwatering good. That being said, if I had to complain I would about the price of the steak being different from the one in the menu ($19 to the menu's 16, both without tax). I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"This place really is a hidden gem (in a basement unit of all places). The staff is incredibly friendly and the food is comforting.  I've only been there for brunch items so far but I definitely plan on getting their dinner plates. I'm always eyeing them down when other people order them since they're big and BEAUTIFUL.  

As for the brunch items, their waffles are delish and I love the benedicts. However, one pointer about this place - if you like jerk chicken, don't order it here.  The jerk is basically just grilled chicken since it doesn't have any jerk flavour.  It's just bland and underwhelming.  Give the other options a shot though.  Fried chicken is good."}
{"text":"Made and impromptu visit here after training one night upon seeing all the positive reviews on Yelp. I had the jerk chicken wrap, and my friend had the jerk chicken salad. They were both absolutely amazing. We had the medium spice level, which for us was just right. My wrap look small, but I can tell you it was deceiving. It was basically just jam packed with huge, delicious chunks of chicken. I did take a stab at the funnel cake after, and it was great. I'm not a big dessert eater, but I really did enjoy it. We most definitely will be making more trips to this little gem.

*Tip: it took pretty long to get our food, which for us wasn't a huge issue because we weren't in a rush at all. Not sure if that's normal for them, but the food was totally worth the wait. Just something to consider if you're pressed for time :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Jerk chicken poutine is must try.  Jerk chicken dinner is good too.  The chicken is nice and moist."}
{"text":"Just as all the other reviews say, the food was great. Kim was awesome. Super friendly. Love to call you out if not a local. We came after a rush around 3:30, so we were seated immediately. We got the the jerk wrap meal which came with hand cut fries and the oxtail meal. If you want heat, ask for the scotch bonnet sauce on the side. Awesome!! (Cleared by sinuses) Refreshing cucumber water to help if you're not into heat. Definitely a local spot."}
{"text":"We walked in and the lady there's greeted us immediately. She was very sweet and let us feel like we were welcomed into her home. I ordered the meatloaf my girlfriend ordered the poutine and a pierogi. The food was excellent served hot and made fresh to order. I highly recommend dinning here."}
{"text":"This spot is cool.  Small with a local flair.  Had their jerk chicken poutine (it was ok...bit too salty), jerk oxtail dinner (amazing), and brownie cheesecake with ice cream and baileys (really good). Friendly service and great comfort food."}
{"text":"This place had good reviews so me and my wife tried it out. We were greeted with cucumber water and the hostess was very nice and made small talk with us. She recommended a jerk chicken entree saying it was very popular and you get a lot of food. My wife got the seafood pasta and she said it was very good. The jerk chicken was a huge plate of jasmine rice and a pile of perfectly cooked chicken (probably 8-10 oz) a bowl of coleslaw and a salad. Everything was delicious and the hostess even gave us a discount because we said we picked the place because of Yelp reviews. Highly recommend this place food a delicious and filling meal."}
{"text":"Did someone say chicken and waffles...or is that someone whispering to me Under The Table....

While visiting Canada I found this cute little place on Yelp. I found parking outside but I wasn't sure if I understood the parking signs correctly. I ran in the restaurant asking Andrea, the lady who worked there if she could help me. Andrea helped me figure it out and then sat us down to eat! 

There were so many choices on the menu and I wanted them all. They had regular chicken and waffles, chicken and waffles with berries (Itanni), and even jerk chicken and waffles. They had lots of breakfast, my favorite and lots of choices. I wanted to try the jerk chicken but I thought it might've been too spicy for my mom. So instead we got the Itanni which was fried chicken, waffles with maple triple berries sauce. It was sooooo good! It was a perfect size to share since I also ordered a breakfast plate. 

My breakfast plate had egg whites, bacon, potatoes, and butter bread. She told me the butter bread is just like white bread... But they must have buttered it to perfection because I could've eaten a pile of it. Great cheat meal! Everything thing I tasted was delicious. 

I also thought it was cute that they had old-school hip-hop playing in the background. Maybe 90's R&B. What else can you asked for when you have great customer service, bomb food and good prices?! 

I definitely wish I could have come here a few times on my trip to Canada! I know they have more delicious dishes Under The Table! One of my favorite meals on my trip!"}
{"text":"This place deserves all the stars on Yelp. I stopped in for Easter brunch and they had a booth for me and my friend. 

The fried chicken and waffles are,  hands down,  the best in the city. Fluffy waffles,  crispy,  juicy,  boneless chicken comes with either maple bacon dijon or maple berry sauce. I couldn't decide so they split my meal and served me both sauces separately.  

My friend ordered the royal French toast and chantilly cream was layered in between the slices of bread. So yum. 

Our dishes were both $13.00 and although, I did think it might have been a little pricey,  it's definitely worth it since the food is just so good and the portions are huge. 

I'm coming back to try their dinner!"}
{"text":"25 years ago I had my first and only piece of jerk chicken. It was a tough, dry, oddly spiced piece of meat. So I took it off my food list. Until today.  The jerk chicken at Under the Table is fantastic. I ordered it medium spiced and it was so juicy and tender and went extremely well with the jasmine rice, zesty coleslaw and salad. A huge portion for $12. Exquisite.  The menu is very interesting with a variety of plates to please any pallet. The atmosphere is cozy and neighborhood like. However, as it only seats perhaps 25 people, reservations are strongly suggested.  They even have takeout spaghetti on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday night as a special for get this: six bucks. How could you go wrong?!"}
{"text":"~Found this place on yelp, decided to go here from the reviews....We weren't disappointed at all....The food was fresh and made to order....Kim the hostess was really nice and welcoming....Will def try when in Toronto again~"}
{"text":"After reading several reviews on yelp I felt I had to try this place out. To see if it was worth all the positive reviews that I read.

As a result my wife and I attended and we were met by Kim who greeted us with a warm hello and sat us promptly. We had the soup of the day which was a turkey vegetable and I have to say the restaurant crushed it. It was very delicious. Then my wife had the jerk chicken dinner and I had the roast beef prime rib dinner. Both were excellent, the jerk chicken was very flavourful and moist. The prime rib was fantastic and cooked to perfection. I would highly recommend \"Under The Table Restaurant \" to anyone who wants great food at a very reasonable price.

Thank you so much"}
{"text":"I was brought here by a friend of mines who wanted to take me for brunch.. Told me about this little place he had found and that it was amazing and that I had to try it...

I walked in not knowing what to expect.. Cute little place kinda reminded me of cheers the show.. :) the owner was there and she greeted us with a great big smile and made you feel right at home... 

She came over and gave us water with a twist of lime.. She took our drink orders and got em right away.. I had the herbal tea she recommended (super delicious) and he had coffee... 

I had the Saturday special ($5 great price) choice of 2 eggs done any way, bacon, home fries (to die for btw and made from scratch not frozen) and 4 pieces of 12 grain toast with a side of bangers... And he had the made it yourself omelette mushrooms, bacon and smoked salmon with home fries and 2 pieces of 12 grain toast.. 

Food came out In a reasonable time frame (under 10 mins from the time it was ordered) and piping hot.. Took my first bite of my home fries all I can say is OMG YUM!! Such tasty home fries to die for !! I can sit there and eat a whole bowl of it.. Everything was excellent and all made from scratch.. 

He said that we needed to try the funnel cake it was amazing there!! so I said lets do it and spit one... When it came it was sooooooo appealing to the eyes.. Hot funnel cake with vanilla ice cream and fresh berries.. If I wasn't so full from my so very large breakfast, I would've gotten one to myself.. :) 

Overall amazing experience there... As i sat there and watched them greet other customers and regulars, I realize it was exactly like cheers cause they do get to know your name and get to know you on a more personal level which is really great cause it's like coming to see family, so it makes you wanna come back again and again.. 

Most definitely would recommend to the breakfast & brunch lovers who want a real comfort feel type of breakkie.. 

They have a points card where you can get points for every time you spend money there and can redeem points towards food there.. 

Can't wait to come back soon :) cheers !!"}
{"text":"The only thing disappointing about this place is that it took me so long to try it. Perhaps one of the most 'authentic Toronto' restaurants I've ever been to. Unpretentious, warm, & welcoming. Service is incredible and the free refill coffee isn't some burnt pot brown diner water, it's a full bodied brew by a staff who are paying attention to the little details that make dining experiences worth writing a review for.

I had the special. Jerk Chicken and Waffles which were just the right amount of spicy and unsurprisingly excellent. The chicken comes deboned so you can dig right in without fussing with a carcass and ruining the pillow soft waffles hidden underneath. 

Under the table has all the hallmarks of a Cabbagetown institution in the making. Bravo!"}
{"text":"The person that took me here (for my first time) seemed to be a regular because the owner greeted us and welcome back my friend. It was pretty full (no 2-seaters) except the one by the door with a reserve sign on top. She immediately told us to sit down and she removed the reserve sign for us. That was a nice and welcoming surprise. 

My friend suggested the \"jerk chicken\" and since the chef is Jamaican, I knew I couldn't go wrong. We both got the jerk chicken, and I gotta say, I don't think any of us tried to make conversation until we finished. 

The jerk chicken was cooked perfectly and the chicken was so juicy, flavourful and simply delicious. I've only ever had jerk chicken a few other times (in Turks & Caicos Island), but hands down, this was better (not as dry or burnt). 

The place is pretty hidden and you gotta walk down a few steps to its main entrance, but even then, it's door front is curtained all in black and all you really see is non-lit sign \"Under the Table\" with a bright fluorescent OPEN sign. Other than that, you wouldn't know what a gem this place is. 

Once we walked in, it felt homey, looked homey, and most importantly, it was packed. 

This was a fun experience and I'm glad my friend took me here. But as for me (no car) I found it harder to get to using TTC! (So please open up another one more central please!)

I'd definitely go back, and maybe next time I will try something different ;)"}
{"text":"Best food ever! Please go and support Kim (front of house manager) and Betty (chef). 2 beautiful ladies that poured their heart and soul into this establishment. 5 star food at 2 star prices. Great for lunch, dinner and weekend brunch. My biggest fear is that too many people will find out and there will be a day when brunch line ups are around the corner (have you seen Lady Marmalade on Queen East in Leslieville ? - the line up is an hour and brunch quality and selections are very poor. #fad #wontlast #hugedisappointment ). 
Great soups, salads, canadian and island food, and traditional brunch. $5 Saturday brunch special (the works: eggs, bacon or sausage, homefries and toast). The plate isn't big enough for the food. Cheaper than McD's and better quality than The Ritz."}
{"text":"Pro:

Friendly staff. Definitely feels like a mom and pop where regulars will go in and they'll great each other. Food is decent and portions are fair.

Street side parking and the meter is right infront of the restaurant.

Cons: 
Located inside the basement probably has 8 tables (could be more or less I don't remember exactly)

Decor needs to be upgrade (IMO)

Although, I gave them high rating because their services but the location and decor it needs work. I will recommend you give it a try but I don't know if I'll return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Loved this place! 

Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning for my birthday! It was surprisingly empty (but ended up having a line by the time we left, so this must have been a fluke). The food is crazy cheap for how good it is...\"five star dining at two star prices!\"

We ordered the chicken and waffles (soooo good! The waffles weren't the usually weird soggy mess, but instead almost like crunchy, yes fluffy pancakes from a waffle mould). I had the meatloaf which was super flavourful and came with delicious mash, toast and an egg (I had this poached and it was like loco moco...one of my favourite Hawaiian foods). The steak Benedict was amazing! The meat was amazingly flavoured and extremely tender (could have eaten an entire plate of it) and the eggs were done perfectly. 

Will DEFINITELY BE COMING BACK FOR MORE BREAKFAST...AND LUNCH...AND DINNER!! 

Side note: Kim and the rest of the staff are absolute delights! Kim was super friendly, made great conversation and recommendations for food. She also made a point to ask me what kind of music I liked so she could play it for me on account of it being my birthday."}
{"text":"I came on a Sunday evening and made sure to make a reservation because fellow Yelpers had mentioned it was a small place. In the end, I'm very glad to have tried it and enjoyed it all.

Staff: I didn't catch the name of the lady serving us, but she was very friendly and personable. They were definitely on top of clearing dishes and providing fresh utensils which provided this great sense of comfort. 

Ambience: It's definitely a cozy place. Dark wood all around, a television airing sports and music that I grew up listening to (Lauryn Hill FTW!). It had a great sense of welcome.

Food: They provide cucumber water and it was quite refreshing especially since there are so many spices. I had the Coconut Shrimp to start which unfortunately overcooked. It probably would've benefited if they had use jumbo shrimp. However the coconut coating was light and the dipping sauce was yummy. I had the Jerk Chicken Dinner which was jerk chicken with rice, a garden salad and coleslaw. It was so filling and very yummy. Excellent jerk! Lastly I had shared the funnel cake and it was probably the best dessert I've had in a long time. It was fresh, it was topped with all kinds of berries and a giant scoop of ice cream. It was heavenly!

I definitely want to come back and try their wraps because they sounded delicious too."}
{"text":"Chef's breakfast was amazing!! One of the best meals I had for breakfast. Nice place and really good food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Once for brunch and once for supper. Both times I was served by a waitress who didn't seem to particularly like her job. She kinda looks like she might be related to the owner, which would explain how she got the job. The owner of the restaurant was herself cheerful and had great energy.

The first time I went, I had waffles and chicken which was ok. The second time I had their oxtail dinner which was flavoursome but the portion of the stew was so small. I also tried their sangria which had tasty fresh fruit but not enough alcohol. 

I love that Under the Table is around the corner from where I live and it's owned by a queer couple, but the food isn't stellar and their waitress needs to be less grumpy and not forgot orders. I don't think I'll be returning for a third try."}
{"text":"On one of our tiring Pokemon hunts, we decided to stop in for a meal at Under the Table one night because my bf had gone previously and raved about this place...and as much as I hate admitting he's right...he was right.  

We ordered a seafood pasta and oxtail dinner and they were both phenomenal.  I have to say though, that the seafood pasta was definitely my personal favourite.  It had the right amount of flavour and the sauce was spectacular.  

This cute little place is literally a busy hole in the wall and our server was absolutely fantastic.  I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Under the table is a classy Caribbean restaurant that servers up amazing Caribbean food with an elegant twist. I had the fried chicken on a bed of rice with spinach special and it was amazing. You can tell by the flavours in the food that the cooks take their time to make the food. The place isn't huge, but the people who work there are extremely friendly. 

This place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great little place with delicious food! Has a really homey, comfort feeling to it. I will definitely be going back. A must go to if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Pros: - Friendly atmosphere
- great service
- food was unbelievable 

Cons: There are none!

The chicken and waffles are my favourite dish here. Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place truly deserves 5 stars, Kim the chef was a beautiful soul and the food was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Never disappointed by this place - affordable, food is always delicious, waitress is lovely. Always have specials that are around $11-13 and delicious. There's no air conditioning so can get pretty warm in the summer but the restaurant is in the basement and food makes it worthwhile!"}
{"text":"D and I is slowly making this place a go to place not only for brunch but for dinner too. We came here the other night for dinner (I didn't want to cook after my long day - flight back into Toronto and then going straight into the office). This place is very much a community restaurant. I noticed that the people that work at the restaurant actually know some of the customers by name. D ordered the oxtail dinner and I order the jerk chicken dinner. Both dishes were so good. The portions are very big and the prices are definitely very reasonable. I liked the oxtail dinner more than my jerk chicken dinner although both were delicious. The oxtail was fall off the bone, really tender and the flavors are really good, especially when you eat the rice with the oxtail sauce. The jerk chicken dinner was good too. I ordered mild as I can't eat too spicy - even at mild, the chicken had a nice kick to it. I find their jerk chicken is much better than another jerk chicken place in Kensington Market that I've been too. Overall, wonderful food, very comfortable ambiance. An added plus, the place is not noisy at all."}
{"text":"My kids declared this place \"the best restaurant in Toronto.\" It's in a fun location and the food is terrific--a lot of variety so everyone in the family can find something they like. (I strongly recommend the jerk chicken salad!) The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We just sorry we won't be able to eat here again until our next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"Home cooking, but with a level of sophistication and complexity of flavours that comes from a highly trained chef. Case and point--hot sauce. Yeah, it's got heat, but the flavours you just don't typically get from even the best home made hot sauces. Mom simply cannot cook like this! 

I'm convinced that Chef Betty can make any type of dish taste absolutely amazing. I have tried everything on the menu and it is all great. Try to find a better oxtail dinner or jerk chicken in the City. You won't find it. You could easy pay 3x as much for dinner and walk away thinking, Under the Table beats it hands down. 

Kim is great! Makes you feel like part of the family. You walk in and just want to hug her. Reminds me of the experience you often get in Italy, but rarely in Canadian restaurants. Where the wait staff have a personality and really know how to socialize with customers. 

There is a reason why this restaurant gets so many perfect reviews. It's perfect!"}
{"text":"I would give this place five stars just on service alone. Kim is not only an amazing server but a genuine and amazing person. She just hugs you as if you've been best friends all your life although you just met her! Even if the food was awful her service would make it worth it, but the food is just as awesome! I completely understand why this place has such a high rating as not only is the food amazing but the prices are reasonable! I had the jerk chicken dinner (12$) and my girlfriend had the oxtail dinner (15$). We got the only oxtail dinner for the night as the delivery was late and they could only make one portion! (Thanks to KIM!) 
The jerk chicken was melt in your mouth delicious without being greasy or fatty, and the oxtail dinner was the best I ever had! We finished with the toffee sticky pudding (6$) as per Kim's recommendation and it came nice and warm! It was an amazing dessert and I will definitely be a regular from now on! Will definitely try the funnel cake next time!"}
{"text":"Went in for a couple of times by myself . Based on their great reviews and the fact is its close to me  the corner of Wellesley and Parliament . I never notice this place and if it were not looking on yelp I wouldn't find it .  The service is excellent she is on top of her game , always happy to answer questions and very knowledgable with their food .  She make sure all the table know the daily special and check on whether i like the food .  So the first time I had ox tail dinner with side salad some vinaigrette for the dressing !  It was good but not amazing . Some Jamaican take out places are just as good.  Second time I tried ackee with salted cod that's the national dish of Caribbean.  I never tried ackee and I did liked it a lot . The texture is in between scrambled eggs and tofu well seasoned . The salted cod is not my thing way too powerful like those salted dried fish loaded of sodium can't handle it.   She noticed I didn't like it as much even gave me a discount . That made a big difference when they really care about the reviews from the customers and try to make them happy : )"}
{"text":"As a lover of true Jamaican cooking, Ya Mon, this place was a bit of a let down. Granted I ordered from Uber, so quality may have been compromised, but who serves jerk chicken on jasmine rice? I requested they swap it for rice and peas. It was slightly dry, lacking gravy and the Jerk, well it just wasn't hot. If you are seeking authenticity, this is not the place for you, but if you want a decent home cooked style meal with a slight Jamaican flare, you will enjoy."}
{"text":"Wow!! Thank you Kim for really making our experience to remember!  The wait-staff were great, Kim's recommendations were fantastic, and the food was not only affordable, but very delicious. This was a place that we will stop into whenever we are in the Toronto area and I would recommend you do the same.  As seating is limited, I would tell you that you should call ahead and or go at an off time.  The limited seating does allow for a more personal atmosphere, and it not only gives a home-like feel, but Kim is always there and checking up on you!  Thanks again Kim!! 
    I had the jerk chicken, my wife had the meatloaf, kid 1 had chicken fingers and kid 2 had a grilled cheese. Everyone was appreciative of their food, the grilled cheese was delicious, hand breaded chicken was devoured by the kids who also loved the fries.  
      If you do order the jerk chicken, and you enjoy extra spicy food, I would highly recommend the extra hot sauce on the side. It is the best hot sauce I have ever had, no contest!! Not so hot that it just burns, but it the taste was fantastic and it was hot enough to bring tears to my eyes!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! The owner was so friendly and gave us lots of information about the area and the city. We are from out of town, so it was helpful to know about the location. 

The first time we came, we had the chicken and waffles. It was sweet and savory. Be ware of the hot sauce - when she says it's hot, she means it, though it did add a nice heat to the dish. 

We came back the next day for our final meal in Toronto before heading home. We had the chef's breakfast (breaded chicken, eggs and potatoes on toast) and the prime rib eggs Benedict. Both were amazing. The breads come fresh from the bakery right across the street and the English muffin on the Benedict was the best we've ever had. 

The prices are extremely reasonable and the food is definitely all fresh. I would highly recommend this place to out of towners and locals alike!"}
{"text":"I ate here twice. The first time, I ordered delivery from Door Dash. I had the Jerk Chicken and the Cajun Seafood Pasta. But the Oxtail is by far the best part and I stumbled on it by accident.

The portions are sufficient such that any one item would make you full. Having ordered both, I ate half the Cajun Seafood Pasta (which made me full as is) and then I tried a few blocks of the Jerk Chicken. The Jerk Chicken dinner actually comes with oxtail gravy (yum!) and when I bit in, I think they accidentally gave me a piece of Oxtail. This piece of oxtail was f*****n delicious.

I went over the weekend to the actual restaurant and the waitress knew everyone there (except me) because they all seemed to be regulars. I got the Oxtail dinner because it was f*****n delicious. It's not greasy at all and it's very tender. This is one of the best oxtails I have ever had.

The salad was OK - it was standard Subway topping-level salad. But the Oxtail dinner was magical.

The only thing I would say is that when they call it Under The Table, they actually mean Under The Ground. The restaurant is located below street level so it was hard to find after I parked (pay parking is easy to find).

The albeit pricey for what it is food (because Jerk King is a lot cheaper) was great. Strong 5/5 for the Oxtail Dinner, 4/5 for the Cajun Seafood Pasta and the Jerk Chicken is OK at a 3.5/5."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Caribbean restaurants in the city! Service is fantastic and food is awesome."}
{"text":"This review is based on service..not food since we did not get the chance to try out the food. My party of 4 was super excited about trying this place out given the rave reviews. I have it bookmarked for ages..so I was beyond happy when my bf let me choose the place for his birthday dinner. I read reviews and most said brunch was busy so I thought \"meh..dinner shouldn't be that busy\"..however I did not think the restaurant was as small as it really is. The yelp photos make it seem larger than it is... So off we trudged, on what must have been the coldest winter day yet. I talked the place up to the rest of the group who was apprehensive. 

Anyway,we eventually found it on parliament and opened the door to a long black curtain covering the door. \"That's odd I thought\" as I pushed the curtain aside. I walked right into what seemed like a private event ( although I don't think it was ) I was leading the group inside. Anyway...the pple seated inside kinda ignore me even though the black curtain looked like it grazed a few of them who were seated close to it. I looked around for a few secs confused. Eventually caught the gaze of one of the waitresses (I assume by the big red tshirt she was wearing) who just stood there looking at me confused. I was obviously missing something. So I asked if there was space ..she whispered a response which was barely audible when another women seated looked up at us and yelled from the bar that all the seats were reserved from 8pm, then put her head down as she continued to write something. She literally yelled across the restaurant over her seated patrons. I come to find out her name is Kim..the owner or manager I think. Either way..I don't care. She was rude. That left a bad taste in my mouth. Sure u are fully booked but how about...
1. Coming over to address us instead of shouting across the room..
2. Finding out if we had been there before and  suggesting we make reservations next time seeing as we obviously didn't know. 
3. Offering for us to take out maybe? It was after all before 8 and their Facebook page said they were open until 11. So you permit 3 hr seatings for the reserved tables? Seems kinda odd. 
4. When I think back now...the bar seats they have in the yelp photos had no one in them..why couldn't we sit in those? Also the table to the left at the top of the restaurant was empty from what I recall..it looked like they were organizing napkins and cutlery on it. 

Either way..she didn't crack one smile and this experience was very off putting. Needless to say..we will not be coming back. Seems the food is good but I will never know."}
{"text":"This is such a hole in the wall place in Cabbage town, located underneath another restaurant.  I stumbled upon this restaurant on Yelp and dragged my cousin to come with me after our spa day.  I chose Under the Table Restaurant because it was close by and because there were a lot of nice looking salads shown on their Yelp page.  My cousin almost dragged me out of this place because it looked so shabby, but I convinced her to stay after seeing all the delicious looking dishes on everyone's tables.

We were not disappointed.  We had the poutine made with fresh potatoes, chicken BLT with soup and the jerk chicken salad.  It was all really delicious and the portions were large, but not American large where it can feed your whole family.  Everything was made fresh and was just so flavourful.  The jerk chicken, oh my god... soo tasty!  Service was fantastic and our server/restaurant owner helped us pack the food that we couldn't finish.

I love finding delicious food made with love at reasonable prices.  Two mains and an appetizer came out to under $40.  Oh, and since I checked in on Yelp, I got an additional 10% off.  I'm so pleased!  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had my first meal at Under the Table last night and it most certainly won't be my last.  I had a fish combo - salmon, shrimp and halibut (I think).  It came in a delicious dill sauce with garlic mashed potatoes, broccoli, asparagus and carmelized onion.  The fish was perfectly cooked and the dill sauce was so delicious I had to scoop up every bit.  My friends ordered funnel cake for dessert and I had chocolate brownie with ice cream and caramel sauce.  Wow - the brownie was so good and it was the perfect ending to the meal.  My friends couldn't manage all the funnel cake so gave me a bit (never had it before).  I will be having that next time.

Bottom line, the owners are lovely and very friendly.  The atmosphere feels like your home with a group of friends and the food is really delicious.  The prices are very fair and I can't wait to go back and try the oxtail!"}
{"text":"Cute and cozy place with friendly staff and great food. I got the Itanni which was chicken and waffles with the triple berry sauce. It was delicious, the chicken was moist, the waffle was fluffy and tasty. I would definitely return if I were in the area again."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Atmosphere is Cozy & Friendly. Great Service and a Welcome Addition to the Neighbourhood !!"}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I've ever had!

Very cozy atmosphere & Kim! The lovely Kim is one of the nicest people I've ever met who works in the service industry!

The industry exists & is surviving because of people like her!

The food is great and very delicious!

{"text":"I've been here for both dinner and brunch - and both times had a positive experience. The restaurant is on Parliament street, in the heart of Cabbagetown - it's a bit hidden as it's on the lower/basement level.

For dinner - I tried the seafood plate (fish was a bit dry but overall felt pretty clean) and a bit of my friend's order of the oxtail dinner (the meat was tender and pretty flavourful). For brunch, my friend and I shared the french toast (I always try the french toast at new brunch spots - this was served with plenty of cream cheese and syrup), while I also had the berry bowl (a yogurt parfait with honey but no nuts, so wouldn't be filling on its own) and my friend the chef's breakfast (fried chicken on an egg benny - quite satisfying).

Overall, while it may not be the best tasting food I've had, everything on the menu is very well priced so it's definitely worth a try if you're ever in the area. The food, and service (friendly and decently speedy), will not disappoint."}
{"text":"We were a large group that came in and they were very accommodating with us, especially considering we had 2 preschoolers and a baby.  The owner was awesome and she was training a server that day who was also good.  The food was delicious and a good portion for the price.  I had one of their cocktails, similar to a dark and stormy but it was so good, with the bite of the ginger beer offsetting the alcohol.  It did take awhile for some of the food to come.  I ordered the chicken and waffles and it was delicious though the waffles weren't what I was expecting (almost like a half pancake/waffle).  I would definitely go back if I was in the area as there were some other items I'd like to try next time."}
{"text":"Oh my god, yessss!

There's over a hundred great reviews for a reason... Go in for yourself and find out why. You won't be disappointed. 

The Full Monty and Chicken and Waffles. Add a runny egg on the Chicken and Waffles, you NEED it, it will change your life.

Servers are great, food is awesome. I'll be back UTT, I'm in love..."}
{"text":"I usually don't like to do reviews. However, I was visiting Canada with my brother. We went in for a brunch and literally THE BEST BREAKFAST I have ever tried. The food was out of this world, the service was outstanding. The music and the whole atmosphere was the best. If you're in Canada try it and thank me later. Thanks again guys for making such an awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"The hours of operation have been recently changed. I took an uber ride to grab brunch with some friends and this place was closed"}
{"text":"No-BS comfort food, heavy on the Jamaican influence, with a few Canadian twists.

The Yelperatti lean towards jerk chicken options here, so that is where most of our table went with their entree options. First off, we dug into a collective plate of jerk chicken poutine. It had all the spicy jerk sauce goodness (with a healthy dose of scotch bonnet pepper sauce to boot) and rich, beefy gravy. A great take on a signature Toronto dish.

Jerk chicken and oxtail stew both tasted like legit Jamaican fare to me, accompanied with an ample dose of perfectly flavored rice and peas. Their fried chicken had a thick, southern-style batter that would 't be out of place in an Atlanta eatery. 

Awesome, attentive service and bottles of Steam Whistle augmented a great meal. My kind of place.

If I lived back in Toronto, I could see myself making frequent trips to Under the Table."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant dining experience.  Food was  very good and the waitress was friendly and helpful.  Oxtail was good but I would not go so far as to call it extraordinary. All in all, a very nice neighborhood dining experience."}
{"text":"nice food staff are friendly spicy jerk chicken is delicious but bit spicy highly recommend"}
{"text":"Woooo, yelpers, this place is really special. The vibe is so comforting and cozy and the food was fantastic! I was expecting comfort food based on all the reviews, but somehow, to me, \"comfort food\" implies an element of crackitude, like a box of macNcheese in bed, and there was none of that. It was just super wholesome, well-made, absolutely delicious food. The perogies were out of control amazing, and the jerk chicken and meat loaf were totally delicious as well. And great portions for the price -- we both took some home. Also, all the raving reviews are true: Kim is this incredibly warm and lovely person. I was chilling at my table seeing her talk with people and connect strangers with each other, and it seemed like she left this trail of smiles and laughter in her wake. I spent a few minutes reevaluating my life and what good I can do in the world. Anyway, this place rocks and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't disappoint in hospitality and wonderfully spiced food. We met the owner who was as warm and sincere in her conversation with us as all previous reviewers observed. My jerk chicken was the obvious choice for me since I had never had jerk chicken. If this is the standard, it will be a big disappointment if future jerk chicken isn't as well prepared. 
My only disappointment was that the owner didn't have the time to personally make the Baileys Chocolate cheesecake we wanted to order. She explained she usually makes all the desserts. 
I guess it is a reason to go back the next time we are visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Amazing, cozy, laid back atmosphere with the sweet tests owners who also serve. The jerk chicken salad is a go to that won't disappoint. Very generous on the chicken"}
{"text":"I completely agree with Katie K. After all the amazing Yelp hype, I drove almost an hour from where I was to visit this restaurant for Sunday brunch, and I wasn't super impressed.

We got the eggs benny and chicken waffles, along with some juice and coffee. Unlike most diners, I don't think coffee is refillable? Finished my coffee in 5 minutes before my food arrived but was not offered any more.

Eggs benny was simply average. It was nothing special, nor did anything stand out. I usually don't like my eggs benny with chicken but I thought I'd give it a shot.  Portion was amazing but I expected a lot more from this place.

It seems like there are a lot of regulars visiting this restaurant. But for a new customer, the service can definitely be improved."}
{"text":"Yum hands down one of the best meals I have enjoyed while in the Toronto area this quaint great vibe restaurant probably deserves a sixth star staff has a great personality which makes the experience that much more enjoyable. Prices are very reasonable I enjoyed the prime rib cooked a seasoned secret way
Rice and beans with veggie medley au jus and horseradish wow great flavor!
Oh did I mention big portion!"}
{"text":"We went for brunch today with our 10 month old daughter and a couple of friends today. The food was so good and the service was fantastic. Our daughter really loved the waitress Kim and she was so drawn to her! She even held her and walked around the restaurant to say hi.

We were seated at the front originally because it was pretty busy. We called about 20 mins before we arrived (2pm) so we were lucky to get a seat (thanks!). She also moved us inward when there was a bigger table available because she didn't want our little one to get cold (so sweet). 

My husband and friend ordered the rib special (for brunch! Soo yum), our other friend ordered a veggie omlette and I ordered the steak and eggs. So yummy! Photos attached.

We parked down the street and took a stroll up parliament - cabbage town. Luckily we put our daughter in a carrier because the restaurant has stairs leading down to the entrance and when we called Kim mentioned the restaurant was a but small inside so we opted for no stroller. 

All in all, great place and we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I visited the venue for my 7th time four days ago - the fact that it was my 7th visit there should tell you something, and it does.  Quite simply, I can't really find a single thing do dislike about UTT.  Everything from the variety of food (even more commendable considering it's a quite small place) to the quality of the same, not to mention the really great value: some big portions and overall large quantities of food (and I must mention the quality again) for such great prices.  And to top it all off, top-notch service from the server, Kim, when I/we go there.

At this point I should clarify: every time I've gone there it's been with a dining out social Group, which means a bigger group of people and more customers overall in the restaurant, but I can't recall the service ever really faltering as a result.  My most recent visit was for Christmas dinner - I was there for the same thing a couple of years ago - and it was great to experience their food again during the Holiday season.  I've been there only once for brunch (so far); I ordered scrambled eggs, bacon, toast and homefries.  My choice was another great value and I'd like to go back for brunch again for my next visit."}
{"text":"- Reasonably Priced considering generous proportions
- Don't miss the spot. You have to take the stairs down
- Highly recommended : Prime Rib Benedict, Must try Chicken and Waffles
- Excellent customer service. Very friendly and servers come up to check up on you several times
- Pro tip : Go with a few friends, hangout there, grab a few drinks. The casual ambiance really encourages conversation."}

{"text":"I went to this place when it was pack and they actually run out of food because they wasn't expecting that many people but they did a great job handling the stress of an unexpected situation. This place is run by a wonderful couple, one of them host and waitress,  the other cooks, All while smiling. It is truly a wonderful place to a great environment. Even the customers are friendly and interactive. we were visiting during Toronto's carnival and what a gem we find. the place is small, clean and  one of the customers offered our table free drinks and even went to the bakery to get us some pastries. on to the food which was excellent. most of the people at our table had oxtail with different sides except for one girl who had chicken. everything was excellent. food had the right amount of seasoning, flavor and juices. rice was cook to perfection and I am Haitian so you know I am picky about my rice. the set up of their dishes are so pretty place is very clean. you feel right at home here made my Toronto experience perfect."}
{"text":"We had a 5 hour layover in Toronto and wanted to eat at a nice place out of the airport. We yelped restaurants and this was one of the top options. After reading the reviews we decided to try it out. So glad that we did! The hospitality is beyond amazing and the food was so good! I ordered the cheesy garlic bread and the chicken club sandwich. Both were so filling. The waitress, Kim also made me a specialty drink which you can see in the pictures. It was amazing and I will definitely recommend this place for anyone going to or in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This tiny hole in the basement wall is all about value. What you pay for the food here is far outweighed by the value you get.

{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere.   The staff and owners make you feel like a regular or like family and will try to accommodate your requests Would highly recommend it to my friends and family.  A small menu but a big variety for everybody's taste. Not a big seating area but it's worth the wait.  Oh yah. Remember make room to order a funnel cake.   Yummy"}

I'll be back again and again.

UPDATE: I have been back ... again and again.

Everything I have ever eaten here was the best version of that thing I've ever had. No, I'm not kidding. My dad, who is normally a pretty stoic sort of guy, treats the meatloaf with nothing less than reverence. He has to whisper when he speaks of it, such is the awe he feels in that moment."}
{"text":"Amazing !!! The food was so good and the service was super friendly. Generous portions too."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Amazing food. Fun & snarky wait staff.

We had the oxtail (which melted in our mouths,) the seafood pasta, jerk chicken and the ackee saltfish. All great in their own ways. The ackee saltfish ratio was skewed much more towards ackee than other Caribbean restaurants, which I liked a lot personally.

Their complementary hot sauce is out of this world. I bought a bottle of it to enjoy at home."}
{"text":"Visited Under the Table for their weekend brunch, as recommended by a friend and it's now my absolutely favourite brunch spot in Toronto.

Most breakfast/brunch spots try and put a spin on the classic--eggs, bacon and toast. What Under the Table has done with this classic is absolutely nothing. They've taken the fluff out of the classic, and focused on making each ingredient on the plate just *perfect*. Bacon is thick and evenly cooked, sunny side up eggs' yolk is runny and the toast is perfectly crispy on the outside with just the right amount of softness on the inside. This experience has been consistent through out.

We've recently ventured out from their Weekend Brunch plate and tried their Chicken and Waffles...let me tell you, they are are heavenlyyy. Chicken is perfectly moist and seasoned with a batter that is lightly crispy (no roof-of-mouth cutting here!) and their waffles are so lightly crisped on the outside and has a buttery taste on the inside.

HIGHLY recommend this spot for brunch. I can't confirm their dinner menu as I've never tried it before, but judging by their Weekend Brunch plate and their Chicken Waffles--it's going to be stellar."}
{"text":"Amazing Service - From the moment you walk in, you feel like you are at home.  The owner is a sweetheart and made us feel welcome.  We had great service the entire time from bringing fresh water to our table to clearing our table.  

Food - YUM!!! Nothing bad to say!  Not a fan of fried pickles but we ordered them to try and they were fried and made to perfection with a delicious dill sauce on the side.  The Bruschetta was delicious.  Soft delicious bread and tomatoes and cheese on the side to avoid the bruschetta from being soggy.  Great idea!

NOW on to the main course, the Jerk Chicken dish.  WOW!!! Such a big portion and so delicious.  The chicken was made perfectly, the rice and beans were great with the oxtail sauce and the cole slaw was bang on.  The salad was also pretty good.  

The customers in there were also extremely friendly and we had a really good time laughing and chatting away.  It was a fantastic dinner ! Definitely going back...this weekend :)"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, prices highly reasonable especially for the quantity and quality  you get. Most importantly the owner/hostess is incredibly personable and caring. We are going downtown to a meeting and my wife wants to reschedule so that we can have supper at \"under the table\"."}
{"text":"What an amazing place.. could not have had a better birthday dinner. The food is amazing and well priced, good portions and the pleasure of Kim's company, she really was amazing. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"It's not news that I love Under the Table (UTT). I am obsessed with their jerk chicken meal, their chicken and waffles (my namesake fyi!), their garlic mash, their wings...oh God those wings & that dip! And the list goes on. So when I need to plan an event, albeit a birthday celebration, holiday party, or I just want to have a delicious meal with friends, I take them all to UTT - great portions, great value and delicious. Do I need to say more? I have had many private parties at UTT, and they have all been received with rave reviews! In fact, many of my friends and their families are now regulars. There is almost no point in asking them where they had brunch over the weekend. The answer is ALWAYS the same!! \"I went to UTT!\" 

In this review I wanted to share photos of other dishes from their menu so that you can see for yourself how ridiculously good the food looks and to tell you that it tastes even better than it looks! I know, you don't believe me. Well, then I dare you to try it for yourself! 

Till next time UTT! :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday, wasn't packed, but there were continuous stream of regulars coming in.

Dishes tried: Jerk Chicken & Oxtail with rice. Jerk chicken had a nice kick to it (as I ordered spicy), the oxtail was very tender, and the sauce with the rice is delicious.
Dessert - funnel cake - I shudder to think of the calories, so I won't. Fried dough and ice cream and fruits and honey, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I haven't reviewed this place yet and I've been here a few times already.
Last order: Oxtail dinner, Chicken & Waffles
The waffles were nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. 
Chicken fried to perfection so flavorful and juicy
I am extremely picky with my oxtail, not everyone can make it how I like. But they def did the job here it hit the spot and the serving size was perfect.
It is a smaller place, downstairs of another spot.
But the service and quality of food they provide is amazing and makes you feel so comfortable
See you again soon!!"}
{"text":"L'ambiance est relaxe, les employés sont très cordiaux et gentil. J'ai mangé un brunch avec une sauce aux petits fruit avec une gauffre et poulet frit. C'était vraiment bon. Le café est bon aussi. C'est vraiment un endroit qui est clairement adoré par les locaux et le staff connais bien leurs clients. La musique n'est pas trop forte et c'est du R&B relaxe. Vraiment un excellent endroit et pas cher!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I had the chicken and waffles with berries for brunch recently. It was some of the most delicious food I have ever had. I could have eaten 3 more plates worth. I am gross.

My husband enjoyed the steak and eggs, but should have ordered the steak rare as it was closer to medium well. He asked for med-rare. 

Kim is the sweetest. We truly enjoy terms of endearment if the person is genuine. Kim is genuinely interested in her customers' well being and strives to provide excellent service."}
{"text":"Oh boy! What can I say about this little restaurant tucked in the basement?  It is unassuming like its owner/operators Kim and Betty.  In the big smoke the restaurant game is generally dominated by the so called 'celebrity chefs' with their 'celebrity clientele and those who love to pretend they are celebrities; it is no secret they do not impress me.  It is the mom and pop brick 'n' mortars like this that truly set off my food appreciation radar.  UTT fits the bill of the type of restaurant that Toronto needs more of.

Came here with a group of friends for Thanksgiving dinner, the menu choice consisted of:

1. Vegetable Soup or Salad
2. Turkey, Ham, or Roast Beef (choose two for only $5 extra)
    includes Mac'n'Cheese, Stuffing, Brocolli/Carrots, Mashed Potatoes, Cranberry Sauce
3. Pumpkin Pie with ice cream

I ordered the turkey and the roast beef (hey...it's Thanksgiving after all!)

The turkey was moist and tasted like the one grandma made, and the roast beef melted in my mouth - so good!

The food overall was like home made and did not disappoint.  Which brings me to the service...it was so nice, seemingly like dining at your favourite aunt's place with Kim efficiently and with great acceptance of everyone enjoying the delicious offerings.  

I will be trying their brunch on Sunday - I understand their chicken and waffles are a must try.

I cannot wait.

Rating 5/5
Food 5/5
Service 5/5"}
{"text":"Found this place from Yelp as it was close by for a wedding rehearsal.
Not a fancy hipster place at all mind you but a warm cozy restaurant with real home cooked food and attentive service. 

It's on the lower level from the street so there are some stairs you need to use, there's a small bar seating 4-6 and 10-12 tables that seat a pair. 

The food is really good, Caribbean to standard diner like fare. The water is infused with fresh lemon and cucumber slices. Our server Kim was very helpful and honest on suggestions as I wanted the special- maple salmon with instead of mash the peas & rice, but she insisted it won't mesh well with the hollandaise sauce. She was right! So I had some on the side instead, cuz it was that good. 
I will admit an hour or so later I was thirsty from dinner, so if you have high blood pressure you might wanna be careful here!

Tip: the washroom lights are in the hallway"}
{"text":"After reading Itanni's fantastic review of her Christmas group dinner at Under the Table, I decided to contact them to see they could do something similar for my bday dinner.

Kim, the manager, was awesome to deal with.  She worked with me to create a menu and put together a very reasonable quote.

Our family style dinner for our group of 15 consisted of spinach salad, vegetarian curry pasta, jerk chicken, rice and peas, coleslaw, oxtail gravy and funnel cakes for dessert.  The curry pasta was a hit, very creamy as was the jerk chicken which was moist and tender but full of flavor.

The restaurant is not that big so our group pretty much took over the entire dining room area on a Saturday night.  Kim provided fantastic, super friendly service - extremely personable and managed to make the birthday girl feel special!

Much love for Under the Table."}
{"text":"The one thing that killed my whole experience was the atmosphere and service and it takes alot to leave a bad taste in my mouth because I'm all about food. But I definitely am never coming back

Our waitress has the weirdest attitude. She took forever to take our order. When she finally came she was already starting to walk away without asking us if we would like drinks. My bf quickly threw in an order for a beer after she  half heartedly described beer options while walking away. Like wth..Then we wait forever for food to come out and he never got his beer despite the restaurant not being busy. She never came back at all to ask if I want a drink. I finally stopped her and asked her for a pop and for my bfs Stella. Which she then brought right away.

Food came out which was good. I got jerk pasta which totally hit the spot. My bf got jerk chicken plate. He felt like it was okay. This is when the service got weirder..

I asked to pack the rest of my food. The waitress silently took my plate and walked off. Didn't ask how food was or offered dessert menu or more drinks.. she then brought back my food packed and then walked off again??? She legit never came back to ask if we wanna pay the bill literally just left us sitting there.

She goes out for a smoke and another lady comes and asks do we need anything and I said just the bill pls. She just looks at me weirdly and says okay.

They leave us there for another 10 min and start eating their dinner as now it's close to closing. Our original waitress nowhere to be seen. I really wanna leave but feel bad that I see the other lady eating her dinner. I wait a few more minutes and finally just ask if we can pay our bill pls. She gets up and says she thought we already paid. Like???? Why would we just be sitting there. With no food or drinks literally waiting??  She brings the bill and then my boyfriend says he has cash. She responds with a disdain \"oh. No one ever has cash anymore\" 

LIKE WTF. 

Just also want to point out another couple customers other than a big group behind us weremt treated great either. One guy actually got up and took his food to go. Another customer came in for a take out order that they messed up for him with no apologies and started having a back n forth with the guy in front of the whole restaurant. 

I don't know how yelp misguided me so bad. Or if like the owner was off and the staff were acting out but it was a really uncomfortable experience and I would really advise they change how they treat ppl."}
{"text":"came in on a recommendation from one of my mates on where to go for take out. was greeted by Kim was very warm and friendly. The had run out of what I wanted to order but other options with a change to accommodate me was offered with no hesitation or arrogance. Space is cozy and service warm. The food was amazing...fall off the bone Oxtail was suburb and probably the best ackee and salt fish I've had outside my Grandmama's place. Can't wait to eat more. Be sure to attend their Fundraiser on November 2nd at the flying beaver."}
{"text":"Under the Table has always been my to-go place whenever I visit Cabbagetown. The owner of the restaurant, Kim, is definitely one of the sweetest and coolest person I've ever met. Whenever I step inside, she would greet me with a big big smile and take me to my regular table which is right next to the door during summer as I enjoy looking outside to the streets, or to the innermost table during winter as I like to keep myself warm.

Everytime I go there Kim always amaze me with her daily specials which is never the same and they always are so good. I could say that I have visited this restaurant more than 15 times in total and I always and try to order different things on the menu and have not been disappointed once. The dishes that I enjoy the most here are the steak and eggs and Chicken Waffles during weekend brunch, their Cajun seafood pasta, super famous Jerk chicken, and definitely their 10oz Ribeye steak (Caution! this plate is enormous). If you are a fan of something spicy, request for their secret housemade ghost pepper sauce, this thing would literally burn your mouth!"}
{"text":"excellent customer service. the owner is very friendly & was helpful. 

jerk chicken poutine is something to try. 
got the fried chicken but I didn't like the corn, and mash potato.. tasted sweet for some reason 

must try their house spicy sauce! 

& funnel cake was gooood 

I will be back on a weekend day to try brunch aka chicken and waffles"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick lunch of coconut shrimp and jerk chicken wrap. Both were excellent! Next time I'm in the area I'll return to try the oxtail. Service was friendly and professional."}
{"text":"nice oxtail?so soft and tasty?the beef pountine has amazing gravy?a little bit salty. Their special dish is oxtail. I suggest bros try it"}
{"text":"After reading numerous rave reviews about this place me and my friend decided to try it. The restaurant is smaller than you would expect but the ambiance was very nice.

I ordered the jerk chicken dinner and my friend chose to order the jerk wrap. His wrap came to the table already broken which was very irritating as all the meat kept falling out as he tried to eat it. For my dish I was happy with the presentation but the food not so much. The portion of the rice was small and my coleslaw was rotten. It smelled sour and the taste was rancid. The smell was so bad my partner almost threw up from it. What irritated me the most was that the owner was there and asked the server what the issue was. Afterwards she continued to talk to the diners she knew and paid us no mind. I don't know about her but if I owned s restaurant I would have at least stopped by the table to ask if there was anything she could do or apologize for serving rotten food. On top of that we had to remind our waitress for a coke that we had ordered and my chicken was not fully cooked. Several pieces were a bit too tender but after constantly calling the waitress over I gave up on the meal.  We got our bill and left. At least the waitress took 15% off our bill. This place wasn't memorable and I wouldn't dine here again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great service. The oxtail and rice and peas were the best, lots of flavour, just melted in your mouth! Will highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After seeing all the great reviews on Yelp my family and I decided to venture out downtown for a late Saturday meal. 

I must say, we were VERY SATISFIED. We were very surprised when we walked in. Although a very small restaurant, it was very popular. We figured out why. 

After reading the reviews, we realized that the brunch menu does not actually have a lot of the items on the dinner menu. We were dying to try the jerk chicken so Kim, our amazing waitress, asked the chef and managed 2 orders of it for my mom and brother. I got the chicken and waffles and my dad got French toast with a berry sauce. 

CHICKEN AND WAFFLES - I've never tried this dish before but it was very good. The proportions were very large and the chicken was on point. The waffles were a little sweet for my liking but really paired well with the chicken. 

FRENCH TOAST - My dad actually loves sweet breakfasts so he really enjoyed this dish. It wasn't overly sweet and the sauce was amazing. 

JERK CHICKEN - By far the best chicken dish I have even eaten. My brother and my mom ordered it but everyone pretty much ate it together. It was delicious and proportions were huge. Did not disappoint. 

Overall, the restaurant really held up to its rep and we will definitely come again! Especially loved the service from Kim - the kindest waitress I have ever met!"}
{"text":"My wife found this place on Yelp and we decided to check it out. Our first impression was that we felt we were in somebody's rec room, the décor is kinda circa 1970's meets down home Caribbean. And, frankly the tile floor and bright lighting hurts what could've been a warm hidden gem. 

There are two owners here. One runs the kitchen, built all the wood furnishings and is apparently a jack (er, jane) of all trades. The other was our waitress. To say she was sweet, warm and friendly is to not do her justice. As for the food, well that really is the  story here. Though the choices are somewhat limited, what we ate was just delicious! The meatloaf was plentiful, flavourful and comforting, the jerk chicken yummy (no need to serve both regular salad and coleslaw, though) and the rum bread pudding dessert was out of this world! I'm just glad the cops didn't stop me for a breathalyzer.

All in all, this place is the definition of cheap and cheerful! Check it out."}
{"text":"We went on an early Sunday morning, on the basis that it was one of the top-rated restaurants in the city. Located in the basement, our first impression was that the restaurant certainly lived up to its name.

We ordered the Sunday Special (eggs benedict with salmon and avocado), as well as the banana pancakes. The eggs benny were nothing to write home about; the salmon could've been fresher and hollandaise sauce was too salty. And while the salad on the side added some colour, it did nothing more than fill the plate.

Even more disappointing were the banana pancakes. While huge and fluffy, each pancake only contained about three slices of bananas. I make better (albeit not as fluffy) ones myself.

The service was really friendly but it was a bit out of my comfort zone. I feel bad giving this rating, as it might have just been an off-day for them."}
{"text":"This restaurant will forever be known now as the restaurant that popped my Yelp Check-in cherry. Kim who runs the show in the front is extremely hospitable and makes you feel right at home so I finally checked-in somewhere for the first time, against my personal weird privacy philosophy, for the 10% discount but mostly for hoping to do something nice for her.

This place is not only seemingly a hole-in-the-wall, but a hole-in-the-basement wall, that i would not have volunteered myself to go down save the wonderful Yelp reviews for this place. And Yelpers were right, the food here is as good as it gets.

I ordered the oxtail that fell off the bone with the delicious rice and peas. Next time, I need to have me some of that jerk chicken and some waffles. Yum!"}
{"text":"I love this small hidden gem on Parliament Street. Kim and Betty are awesome they make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. The food is outstanding I love the jerk chicken and you can't go wrong with their Sunday brunch menu. Hangover Sunday's chicken and waffles here I come."}
{"text":"This was a great place, food service were both excellent.  I went there based on Yelp info and I wasn't disappointed. Had five friends tag along.  Great Fried Chicken, I had the Jerk Chicken pasta, so much.  The starter I had were the perogie and they were great too.  The great server even took a group photo for us.  I will be back when in Toronto.  Terrific place."}
{"text":"It's been on my list for EVER and finally finally finally, I can mark this off with a big fat 5 star.

When I got there, I was already prepared for the down-the-stairs, \"wait, is this it?\" moment. So don't expect to be blown off your toes with the decor. Inside is a clean, slightly dated look with a mirrored bar.

First off, Kim is so sweet and helpful. As my party ordered, she made sure to warn us about the Jerk Chicken Spice-o-Meter, asking each of us what our spice level was. One adventurous friend said \"7\"...and his eyes were watering near the end. One other friend said \"3\" and her dinner was sufficiently spicy by my standard! I ordered the oxtail dinner ($15), which comes with rice and peas and coleslaw. The oxtail was melting in my mouth. I'd barely had my first mouthful and I was swooning. It was SO good. Highly recommend. In fact, when I come back, I may do the unfoodie thing and order the same thing again. Each dish is made to order, so everything is freshly cooked, but takes a bit of time (15 min)

For the finale, even though we were all stuffed, because their portions are fantastic, we ordered a funnel cake to share. This funnel cake was HUGE and for $6, it was a steal! Freshly deep fried, topped with vanilla ice cream, maple syrup and blueberries and strawberries....oh goodness, it was so good. But sharing is caring - this was a big dish.

Fantastic place! Love and will keep spreading the love."}
{"text":"Good friendly service and quick food serving. 
 best jerk chicken in my life. And their home made hot sauce is only 5$ !! 
Fresh salad and big jerk chicken drives me crazy!!!!"}
{"text":"Our dining experience at Under The Table Restaurant was very special. Aside from the  delicious dishes we tried we went away feeling like we just ate at a friend's. Kim was very gracious and welcoming. You could really feel the pleasant homey vibe that makes this place such a gem in the community.

The Jerk Chicken and Oxtail were as good as any I've had in the city. Both were succulent, tender and well seasoned. Not too salty and none of that greasy stuff that give you itis. 

The pièce de résistance was the maple and pecan funnel cake topped with scoop of ice cream. It was enormous and it took more than two to finish. 

Under The Table Restaurant is now one of my favourite caribbean eateries. I'll be sure to drop by again and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best meals I've had in a very long time. Under The Table is a family-owned gem in the heart of Cabbagetown that pride themselves on home-made comfort food. I ordered the oxtail dinner and it was absolutely divine.

The meat was perfectly cooked and succulent and the spices were rich and flavourful - I couldn't stop eating! I also tried a bit of the steak and it was unbelievably good, ten times better than what you'd get at The Keg. 

The coleslaw with vinaigrette was refreshing and tangy. The portions were perfect, not too much, not too little, just right. We were greeted by one of the owners upon arriving and service was excellent, personable, and memorable. 

Many of the patrons here are regulars and are even known on a first name basis. Attire is casual and the music is nice and light. Lots of dining space and great for groups of two or four. This ranks in the top must-eat places in Toronto. 

It's a clear winner."}
{"text":"I'm in this part of town to visit family occasionally, and I always try to make a stop here. Oxtail soup is a standout. Good stop for breakfast. A bit hard to find, but worth the effort."}
{"text":"Amazing grub for a fantastic price. 

What we had, and what you should try:
- POUTINE ($7)
Crispy, rustic fries, a beautiful scatter of cheese curds and gravy
- [SPECIAL] OXTAIL & FRIED CHICKEN DINNER ($15) 
This was sided with rice and beans, coleslaw and a salad. The Oxtail was very flavoursome and had a fall-off-the-bone quality to it, and the Fried Chicken was very tender and surprisingly not oily at all! 
- JERK CHICKEN ($11) 
Served with jasmine rice, salad and coleslaw - the Jerk Chicken was as expected, full of flavour and absolutely delicious. 

A stuffed dinner for two under $40

The pricing is insane! We truly felt that we were ripping them off for this immense quality of this food. 

Their brunch and sandwiches now have me so, so curious! A very homey feel, no bazazz to the whole place at all in this restaurant. Just what we needed tonight!"}
{"text":"This place does not look very impressive from the outside looking in. However, the food has never disappointed and the staff always friendly. 

The jerk chicken is great. Full of flavour. The oxtail is fantastic! I would get this every time. The meat is tender and melts in your mouth. I also appreciate that they don't skimp on the meat for every dish."}
{"text":"After a long day of walking around and looking at attractions this amazing restaurant was the perfect spot for a great meal. Upon entering this restaurant the chef greeted us with a big smile and made us feel right at home. She brought us our waters which was cucumber water. It was extremely refreshing after a long day. The server came moments after playfully joking with us and also making us feel at home. This display of service was one of best I've ever seen. I ordered the oxtail dinner and it basically came with oxtail, rice and beans, salad, and coleslaw. It was a big and filling portion and it was so damn good. The oxtail fell right off the bone and exploded with flavor. The rice and beans complimented the sauce of the oxtail. I also got to try the jerk chicken and fried chicken. Those two were really good too. Both were moist, juicy and packed with flavor. For the table we got jerk chicken poutine. I've never had poutine before and this place really set the bar high. They put real cheese curds and everything was piping out. Anyone who's in this area should try this place in a heart beat. With excellent service, amazing food and good portions, this place is a must try !"}
{"text":"I'm torn on how to approach assessing this place. I like to calibrate my ratings based on what I guess are the objectives of a given restaurant, and I believe a lot of people have made that adjustment here with respect to the price point: Under the Table is going for home-cooked, stick-to-your-ribs comfort food served with a \"make yourself at home\" feel at very affordable prices. I think it does those things well. The \"I'm a fan\" description of the four-star rating makes me pause, though, because I'm not sure I'd return. It just didn't hit the mark on the things I'm looking for when I spend money on dining, but that's not to say it might not for others. That's my disclaimer!

Standout food: the wings. They're really very good; probably some of the best I've had in the city.

Entrees: A few friends ordered the oxtail, one the meatloaf, and a few of us got the seafood platter, which was crazy stacked with seafood: a whole lobster claw, two fish filets (one was salmon, the other was a white fish I can't remember now), and shrimp. Everyone's portions were huge, and I think the group was generally satisfied with their entrees. On my part, the seafood platter certainly was filling, and was not bad in the least (after all, it's not a seafood restaurant)--but I felt like I could probably do better in my own kitchen (which is also not a seafood restaurant, for the record). Really not a complaint because I wasn't expecting a Michelin-rated Bearnaise sauce or anything when I walked into the place, but I did leave feeling a little underwhelmed (rice was kinda dried out and clumpy, the shrimp were either overcooked or were precooked--again, I got a whole barge full of undersea treats for $18 so I wasn't expecting miracles but I would be lying if I said it was great).

Dessert was, first of all, $2 a plate. It was some type of blondie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. We had table-peer pressure with our other friends ordering it; otherwise, we probably wouldn't have bothered since it was store-bought and nothing special. 

People who really like to feel at home in a restaurant, as well as those who like value for their meals in connection with portion size, will love this place. They don't skimp on anything and I think there's an overall warmth and generosity that defines Under the Table's character/ambiance which offers a palpable appeal. For me, it was a bit too far outside of my strike zone for what I like to invest in when I eat out."}
{"text":"Perfect pasta and chicken wings!!! Great service of Kim made me feel like home. Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"The yelp reviews took me there. Best decision ever. Had the pork ribs; huge portion, I thought I won't be able to finish it, but couldn't stop eating once I started. Will go again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now. My first time I had the ox tail, and my second time I had the jerk chicken. Both were hearty and delicious. I love spicy food, even though I sweat like an idiot and look like I'm dying. The hot sauce at Under the Table really brought that out in me. My girlfriend enjoyed her meal as well, she had the fried chicken. I of course helped her eat it because it looked amazing.. and it was.

One thing about this place that I noticed both times was how amazing the staff was. I felt like I was eating at a friend's home. It really is a gem. Prices are reasonable, too. This ranks as one of my favourites in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great little weekend brunch spot. If you're looking for a less snooty downtown brunch place that you can get great food without breaking the bank, this is the place to go. The location is a little bit tricky to find, could use better signage, but for drivers, there's lots of street parking in that neighbourhood. 

The food was a 4/5 for me and a 5/5 for my friend. The only reason mine lost a star was due to the temperature of the meal. My chicken and waffles were cold when I got it whereas my friends chefs breakfast was piping hot and absolutely delicious. All of the food coming out of the kitchen looked wonderful and I will definitely go again to the other things from the menu. 

The waitstaff does come off a little pretentious and aren't particularly attentive but I feel like it's a \"you get what you pay for\" situation. The food is great so, the service is mediocre. 

It gets a little crowded and they could use a bit more attention to detail for cleaning around busy times but that certainly wouldn't deter me from returning. 

The unique atmosphere and the fun food and drink choices will have me returning in the near future. 

100% recommend this place"}
{"text":"I decided to come here based on some yelp reviews, as I was looking for a place to eat brunch. I decided to try the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon and avocado. I love eggs Benedict, and I have eaten it at other restaurants. This one happens to be the best eggs Benedict I've ever eaten in a very long time, plus it tastes more luxurious than the other restaurants that i've been to. this one is going to be a new favourite for me. Now I'm very curious about eating there for dinner, as they serve jerk chicken poutine around dinner time. so far for the first time, really good, highly recommended, I'm looking forward to going back there for dinner. I really highly recommend the brunch menu, the eggs Benedict is fantastic! also, the staff is very friendly and very accommodating. And the food gets out to you at just right time, no long waits, just sheer perfect timing. Again, check this place out, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Detroit area with guests from Germany and looking for a restaurant in the area. Yelp guided us here and we have to say that all the other reviews are correct. We all took the Jerk Chicken and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome place for dinner! It was small spot but very inviting. We had great and very friendly customer service. We had Happiness in a glass... literally! No but really it's a drink that you should definitely try. Also had the jerk which is a must when visiting for the first time. Also tried the snapper (too many bones) but it was also good. All in all it's a great Toronto find!"}
{"text":"Close your eyes point one of meal on menu and choose it,you won't be disappointed.Hot,spicy,sweet anything you want,you will find here with quality and good service."}
{"text":"Located in Cabbagetown, this place is one not to be missed.

On the first visit:
The Chef's wings were definitely a hit with my other (better?) half.  So much so that I had to physically move the dish away as far away from her as possible on the table to ensure she didn't finish them all.   

Afterwards she had the ox-tail, and I had the jerk chicken.  The jerk spices tasted just right, and the chicken was tender and juicy.   As for the ox-tail, we weren't able to reach a consensus.  I found it to be flavourful, but lacking a lightly sweet sauce to complement the saltiness that I'm used to.

And the apple pie was quite flaky and tasty , yum!

Second visit:

Brownie (see picture in reviews).  Yes, it is as good as it looks.  

A full stomach is a happy stomach!  You'll need to have a nice long walk after eating here."}
{"text":"My friend ordered the lamb sausage and curry lentil. I had the chicken waffles with maple bacon dijon. Both of us agreed it was one of the best brunches we've had. 

First the place is small and cozy. We were lucky to beat the rush. Second they do take their time to prepare the food but it's worth it. Both dishes had complex flavors and the personal touch to make it more special. The service is also very friendly. 

Based on the photos here, their lunch items look just as good and I would try it if I was in town longer. But if you're going for brunch you can't go wrong. We saw what other people ordered and it looked fantastic as well. 

Go there!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite restaurant.  The food never disappoints ( spaghetti and meatballs, jerk chicken poutine and the wings are to die for! )
The manager Kim is gracious and the atmosphere here is inviting.   A true gem of a place.  

Karaoke Thursday's is a lot of fun!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a 5 stars... The place is a bit hard to find since it's below street level I had to go through the street 3 times to find it... Absolutely worth the walk!

Had the chef's recommendation of wings... Tastes absolutely mouth watering and filled with delicious flavor with the right hint of spiciness that will make you want more

Also had the ox tail with rice and salad which is quite a fulfilling meal and delicious! Hats off to the chef!

Amazing service and very attentive!"}
{"text":"under the recommendation from a friend i tried this restaurant with a group of 7 ...  this little restaurant that only fits about 25 people, to my surprise was quite good.

although the food did take a long time to come out, the chef explained that it was their sous chefs birthday so she was working the kitchen alone.

we had no problem with the wait after she explained to us very nicely.  

i ordered the oxtail dinner, my friend ordered the fried chicken dinner ... both portions were generous and overall great value.  

the fried chicken was juicy and tasted delicious... i've had better oxtail to be honest.. but they did not stinge on anything.  portions for all their dinners were large.  price was good..

i would return to this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Awesome Service and AMAZING coffee!!! The food was absolutely delicious! We had everything from the chef's wings and jerk chicken and waffles to the lamb sausage, curried lentils and rice peas. The Happiness in a glass was just that... pure happiness (but it couldn't compete with the coffee!) We thoroughly enjoyed our experience and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday late morning (nearing 1pm).

Cons:
- Nothing stands out i guess
- Location
- Just okay"}
{"text":"We used Yelp in looking for a walkable dinner place while visiting Toronto for a family vacation. Picking Under The table based on prior reviews, we were thrilled with our choice. We arrived right before karaoke, which the owner informed us was about to start and we were totally welcome to be a part of. Although we had no intention of doing that, this family owned business was so warm and inviting, before long we were singing along. For dinner we tried the Caribbean jerk chicken salad, Caesar chicken salad and wings. All of the food was fresh, seasoned perfectly and nicely sized portions. For dessert we shared the chocolate brownie with caramel sauce, which was the perfect ending to our meal. We loved this place. The owners are so passionate about their work and it showed in the amount of regulars that frequented the place. That night was one of the highlights of our trip. Would recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday afternoon around 1 and I was surprised to find it empty due to the hype from all the reviews. The waitress was very friendly and seated us immediately. When we struggled with choosing our meal, she recommended the Chef's Wings so we ordered that as well as the Chef's breakfast and the jerk chicken dinner. 

The jerk chicken was pretty good but I felt like it was missing a kick. The Chef's breakfast was so so good due to the buttery base and it tasted so good with the chicken on top. Overall great service, great food, and a great time."}
{"text":"This was a great brunch spot! We actually went early enough to call it breakfast. There is a 10% off deal when you check in on yelp. It's a smaller spot, so seating would have probably been limited if we had gotten there later, but it was great not to have to wait for all of the yummy food. The prices were so reasonable that our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. We tried, but couldn't finish our whole order. Everything was amazing though. 
The chicken and waffles were great!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Very simple, tasty, plentiful, reasonably priced comfort food served up with some very friendly ans helpful service. 
We had chicken and waffles, pancakes and cocktails. This was not my first time visiting and will not be the last.
If you are looking for an instagram worthy brunch experience this place may not be for you though."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Server was rude and unfriendly towards us. Never offered us a drink other than water. Had to wait for menus and drinks so she could clean off the other tables except the place was empty."}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly one of those places where you have to remember the saying \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\". Walking down Parliament street we totally missed this restaurant and had to back track to find it. It's actually located in the basement but there were street level signs.

Stepping inside it was very under whelming. Without all these positive yelp reviews and my desire to indulge in there famous jerk chicken I may have just turned around and left. The restaurant is really dated with old school wood panelled walls, tiny rickety cafeteria tables, and matching wood panelled banquets with saggy pinstriped cushions.

Before I had chance to consult with my hubby of our intentions of staying or leaving our lovely waitress Kim warmly welcomed us and told us to grab a seat anywhere. It was just past 4pm and the restaurant although tiny had about 8 other guests dining. We took a seat against the banquet beside the bar at a corner table. I have to admit the seats were a bit uncomfortable as the wood panelled banquets were awkwardly angled at least they had some sort of cushion and the small table seemed to be at awkward height as well but nothing I couldn't manage. 

Kim came back and delivered us the menus, informed us of the specials, and brought us a pitcher of ice water with sliced cucumbers inside which was a nice touch. They also have daily specials that change all the time but we both knew what we wanted the jerk chicken dinners. We asked to sub the jasmine rice that it comes with for peas and rice and Kim said no problem. I thought there would be an extra cost to do that but surprisingly there wasn't. Kim asked if we like our jerk chicken spicy or mild and we both wanted spicy. She also explained that they grill the chicken made to order so it may take a while. We were both cool with that as hearing our food was not precooked and being made fresh for us was another bonus.

Kim was really nice and chatted with us and keep us posted on the status of meals. What was also nice to see was as guests came in you could see that they were all regulars as she greeted them by name and had there drink orders memorized.

When our meal finally arrived I was in heaven. After that first bite of chicken I knew why there were soo many regulars and why it was so raved about. Seriously some the best jerk chicken i've ever had! The chicken itself was soo juicy and tender, seasoning was perfect, nice grill flavour, and the heat was good without being too much. What I also loved about this chicken was it was all boneless chicken, mostly thigh meat, and not saucy so you get that nice dry jerk seasoning through the moist tender meat. The meal also came served with a garden salad and homemade coleslaw. Normally I hate coleslaw but this one was pretty good, not too creamy and it had a nice tangy sweet and sour flavour. The peas and rice were also really good and the hidden gem in this dish was the bit of oxtail gravy over the rice and a little piece of oxtail with bone. The oxtail was also amazing, so tender and flavourful you could tell they really stewed it well. It was such a nice surprise to find it under the chicken but such a tease because it was soo good it made me want more.

At the end of our meal we were highly satisfied. The portion was ample with lots meat and we definitely fulfilled our jerk chicken craving. This restaurant is also really affordable I think our meal was $11 each which I thought was a total steal! Fresh, flavourful food and a waitress that's soo warm and welcoming you can totally see why so many people keep coming back here. I will definitely be returning to get my jerk chicken fix and to try the oxtail dinner!"}
