{"text":"If the pizza wasn't so amazing, they'd get 2 stars. It's not the food, it's the staff. No eye contact whatsoever,  from anyone, clowning around with each other, and even being rude (not to me, but the guy behind me, who asked which is the pepperoni slice, only to have the girl, with her back to him, pointed at the pizza. It also too forever. Waited - ordered - \"slide down\" - -waited - paid - went back to the first girl and waited more. Maybe 5 minutes to get 2 slices that were already made, and maybe needed to be heated for 30 seconds. Bad system, bad counter help. But like I said - GREAT PIZZA!"}
{"text":"I am in sky harbor airport at least two times a week, and always looking for good food at a decent price. The pizza was actually really good, I was surprised. I got two slices of pepperoni pizza and they were delicious! I would have to say, if your looking for pizza in the airport this is definitely the place to be. I paid around $8.00 for two slices, so not the cheapest but not to bad at all. This spot is located in the B 1-14 gates area."}
{"text":"Wish I could do NEGATIVE 5, rude staff, food took forever, staff got annoyed when I asked status at 30mins, personal pizza"}
{"text":"Pizza is always delicious! Every time I have a flight in Phoenix I make sure to stop by :)"}
{"text":"I was greeted with a genuine smile.  She gave the name of the cashier and everyone seemed to enjoy working at this place.  That is so unusual!!  The food is fresh, since it's in an airport, and the prices were reasonable!!  Will and have recommended this place already!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Not even 8 pm on a Friday night and they are once again closed. Not only closed but already cleaned up and out of here. Why doesn't the airport do something about businesses that don't want to be open? Better yet why doesn't the owner of this place want to make any money? Too bad there isn't a zero rating!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pepperoni pizza is very delicious. The 2 large slices is crisped perfectly. The cheese stretches far when pulled apart. Very greasy."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza. Came here for a slice on a stopover from New York to California. This helped me curb my New York pizza withdrawals. Not much room to sit, but it was a good place to grab a slice on the go."}
{"text":"Wow, best airport pizza!  Very good overall pizza.  Pros:  Very good pizza, good price, large slices. Friendly staff.  Cons:  crowded, dirty tables.  Overall: Stop here every time you are at the airport!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to my gate when pizza samples were given out. I tried the Wall Street and told myself if I had more time I would order it, but I didn't. I returned to the same airport and had dinner at NY Pizza Dept. I ordered a slice of the Wall Street, Chelsea salad and a Bud Light. Best combination ever! The Chelsea salad had peeled chopped cucumbers, sun dried tomatoes, blue cheese and bacon. The Wall Street slice showed off mushrooms, sausage, pepperoni, bacon, oregano, and cheese. And the Bud Light ties it all together. Great prices! Best Airport Food!"}
{"text":"Horrible service waitress was too busy on her phone to ask if we needed another drink, or how our food was. Ordered the Chelsea chop salad, it arrived missing half the listed ingredients. When I told the waitress she went in back and came out stating they didn't have the ingredients that were missing. No offer to order something else, no adjustment offered.  It's the only restaurant pre security so they have a captive audience and fosters the subpar food and employee's."}
{"text":"I would say this is more of a 3.5 star place. But after eating at the Mexican place next door (spending $20+ and still hungry). I decided to grab some pizza. It is nice and very fast. The crust could be better, and the slices could be more evenly sized (I got one normal sized and one super small sliced). But for the price of $7+ for 2 slices it's really a good deal and the pizza is totally more satisfying than the small burrito that you get next door. So if you're debating, get pizza instead of burritos."}
{"text":"First time to Phoenix. Every restaurant we have gone to has had very slow service but this one topped it off. As we walked up to the bar, the only server had her backed turned to patrons, granted she was making a drink but she was also talking on her phone, not only talking but FaceTiming. She chatted the whole entire time we were there on her phone, even carrying it around as she bussed and wiped down tables. Why is this becoming so acceptable?  Pizza was great. Hot wings for my boyfriend came out a good 7 minutes after my food. This is not acceptable service."}
{"text":"Probably the most unorganized business ever. I may just leave and get food elsewhere and still be able to come back and still not have my food ready."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the breakfast pizza which was pretty good but the service was horrible. My coffee was cold when I asked to heat it up the young lady told me to go next door. I told the young girl that I just bought the coffee less than 2 minutes ago she offered to get me another cup which was great but the second cup was cold. I walked away in disbelief and the young girl started telling the crew that I was mad because the coffee was cold. I told her that I expect a hot cup of coffee and she then replied what I expected her to do ?? The SERVICE is HORRIBLE. Being Mexican myself I don't need that type of Latina Attitude at anytime of the day much less early in the morning..."}
{"text":"For airport pizza, it was ok but compared to the real joints outside the airport, it needs an upgrade. 2 slices for $7.50 would be ok if they were decent sized."}
{"text":"Awful. Cucumbers in salad were rotten. Wings cooked so hard the bones broke. Floors and tables nasty. Size of portions inconsistent. Not that you wanted more."}
{"text":"I had two slices of 'Wall Street' and it was excellent.  The prices are actually airport reasonable.  2 slices of specialty pie and a soda for $6.19.  The slices were pretty large as well.  The crust is typical New York thin and the toppings were plentiful. Not greasy either.  Although the line was long when I arrived customers were processed quickly with friendly staff. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sorry but who ever designed the order at one end pay at the other end and fight though all the people waiting in line to pickup your order in the middle is brainless and as stupid as your pizza is greasy"}
{"text":"Would have like to get a slice but this turdhole doesn't make pizza's after 7pm. Man I am in Phoenix old people don't eat after 6pm so the airport restaurants close down"}
{"text":"One of the best places to get really good & cheap food at PHX! They have a big selection of pizza slices to choose from, including vegetarian & vegan choices. And the food is actually really yummy. I had a slice of the margarita pizza, and if my eyes had been closed I would not have known it was airport food. The crust was light and thin, and it was full of a wonderful garlic basil flavor with lots of cheese. With prices like $6 for 2 slices and a drink, no wonder the Pizza Hut in the same row is empty."}
{"text":"Better then any other airport pizza.  Quite nice. Friendly staff. Busy at times. Still nice."}
{"text":"Best deal for airport food. Mediocre pizza... I think the seasoning for the crust got left at TSA. Wasn't a long wait. Vegetarian options exist: Cheese, Bruschetta, & Joey. Tight squeeze so just grab to-go and head to your terminal."}
{"text":"Not quite like NYC, but pretty good pizza. I had the bruschetta slice and a white slice which had tomato and ricotta. Both were tasty, thin crust and not too greasy. Two slices for less than $8 was a good deal for an airport. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Whack! Nothing even close to New York pizza! I'm dying to go back to New York just to eat their pizza. I did not want to say it, but New Yorks pizza is a breed of its own. I've had nothing like it since"}
{"text":"Not too bad for airport pizza! The prices were reasonable and service was friendly and fast even, despite being busy. I had a slice of \"Brooklyn\" and a slice of \"Hawaiian.\" Overall, they were above average for NY style pizza outside of NY. Not bad for an airport in Arizona!"}
{"text":"We had 2 slices of vegetarian and 2 slices of BBQ chicken pizza. Vegetarian pizza was okay. The chicken pizza had 1 tiny piece of chicken per slice. Really tiny. Rest of the pizza was pretty average. I guess most of the people who like this \"trash\" are probably stressed out for/from air travel and not objective enough."}
{"text":"Just had a few bruchutta slices at the Phoenix aiport. As I told the manager as I was leaving, this was the best pizza I've had in a long while. My 10 yr old son agreed. He said,  \"Dad, glad we didn't go to the McDonald's in the next terminal!\""}
{"text":"Worse service ever. Ordered 2 slices of big kahuns and they were given to the order ahead of me. The employee didn't know how to poor beer and gave me attitude that you shouldn't drink beer. Worst service ever."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but VERY limited seating.  Good luck trying to get a  table a busy times in the airport.  Otherwise, every bit as good an airport pizza has a right to be...  ;)"}
{"text":"I hate to give such an awful review because the service was very friendly. I think the service is the only reason I'm even giving this place two stars.  If you're hungry, don't waste your money coming here. If you want beer or wine, knock yourself out.  So... my mistake for not looking at the reviews, but we were starving and kinda in a rush to find food. Obviously I wasn't expecting great food at an airport, but wow... I wish I would've just went to McDonalds. I got a small buffalo chicken Caesar salad. Thank god I got a small because I don't know what I would've done with a large. It's literally just iceberg lettuce, some kind of cheap chicken, and croutons. It was way overdressed, a complete mess. Very sad to say that I've had better salad at Wendy's and McDonalds. Not at all worth whatever I paid for it. It's not easy to mess up a salad.  My boyfriend got a personal pizza, just pepperoni and mushroom. Originally he was going to order the large, but the server made it seem like it was really, really big. So I asked if the personal size was filling and the server said yes. Well, when we got the pizza, I couldn't stop laughing because it was so small. Not trying to be mean, but it was just really funny because it was the size of a Pizza Hut personal pan pizza. I honestly think that they're short of staff and the server didn't want to get slammed making a big pizza. It also took us about 20 minutes for the food and it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"My mom and I loved the pizza, absolutely delicious. In the airport with limited seating, but convenient for those long layovers when you need good food in your belly :D"}
{"text":"I ordered a pre-made salad from their fridge and paid extra to add chicken. Waited for 20 minutes for them to put pre-made chicken in the pre-made salad. Wow. Good thing I wasn't on a time crunch to make my flight."}
{"text":"Good pizza for airport food. Pepperoni slice is better than the Wall Street slice. Price is reasonable as well for airport. I didn't have high expectations and was pleasantly surprised with the food."}
{"text":"Our servers were in a good mood, came and asked us about how our pizza was later, and had a genuine conversation with us. The pizza was not super oily and had a great crunch. Our cashier was a middle aged white dude with gray in his hair and was super nice. We had a great experience.    Also there was a really cute baby at the next table."}
{"text":"This locally owned and operated establishment is a breath of fresh air in Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport   The owner from New York met me with a smile and a menu explained how they take water filet it to zero and then add the exact mineral makeup to match New York City Water   \"ONLY N.Y. WATER MAKES NY PIZZA\"   And he's right!   For $9 I got a hot, fresh 8\" pie with excellent dough, sauce cheese and meat.   I ordered the \"Wall Street\" (pep sausage bacon and mushrooms)   Without the mushrooms because I'm just not a fan.   It came out within 10 mins and did not disappoint   Skip the Wendy's and subway line and come eat here!"}
{"text":"The only place in the airport that was serving lunch options before 10 and I wanted some lunch on the layover. But I do have to say, not only did I not care for the food, but the fact it's called NY pizza makes it even worse. I've had lots of NYC pizza and you sir are an imposter.  The cheese pizza was fine. The chicken parm sandwich was just awful though. I think the chicken was flavorless and the cheese was strangely unmelted but the whole thing including bread was just covered in oragano and other seasoning probably to mask the bad taste but a mouth full of mostly spices isn't better. I was starving and didn't even finish it because it was so weird.  The place did have a decent amount of seating (comparatively) and some areas to charge, so it wasn't the worst place to sit and eat, but I would not recommend coming here if you've had great pizza, but only if you are in a settling mood."}
{"text":"It's not often you can find fresh pizza in an airport.  It's even rarer when the pizza is good.  Amazingly, this joint has both.  My wife and I were starving and in a bit of hurry (also, quite flummoxed after having to hike from one end of Sky Harbor to the other) but we wanted to make sure we got food before we boarded our next flight.    If you're in a hurry, I wouldn't try this spot.  Reheating pizza takes significant time--which you obviously don't have.  If you can spare the 10 or so minutes to wait for it to be recooked, jump in line.  Don't be surprised if there's a build up of patrons as it's a small dining area, spot of a wait and lack of proper direction.  Plus, when people are in large groups their IQ points drop, anyway, which doesn't help.  Two slices and a drink for $6 is a great deal anywhere, and to find that in an airport is phenomenal.  Slices were super flavorful and not even remotely heavy.    Should I end up back in the Sky Harbor, I'll do my best to track this place back down--this time hopefully able to savor the food as opposed to inhaling it."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! It is not greasy and the prices are what I expect for an airport. It is higher than I would pay off airport, but not on airport property."}
{"text":"The pizza was good and the Chesea salad was even better.  Good selection of pizza slices with veggies and combos.  Price was decent."}
{"text":"This place is proof that, if you fly out of the non-hub airline terminal, you're screwed.  There was one young lady waiting all the tables and she was about as unconcerned with providing good service as I can imagine.  I ordered the Brooklyn and a side salad.  I was not asked what dressing I wanted on my salad and was brought Ranch when it was brought out.  The salad appeared to have come from a bag because it was dried out and mostly discolored.  It was garnished with several cherry tomatoes for good measure.  The pizza I first received was not the one I ordered.  I politely told her I had ordered the Brooklyn.  She took it back, stopping at the terminal to see what I really ordered.  The correct pizza was eventually brought out with not so much as an acknowledgement of the error, let alone an apology.  That pizza was hot, fresh, and actually pretty decent for airport food.  I mainly blame the owner for this poor experience as it is obvious that the place is not being well managed with poorly trained employees who do not seem to care."}
{"text":"Place is a dump. Pizza is just ok and salads are low quality  Not much else to say besides I would never go back"}
{"text":"So this morning, my 4-year old and I were rushing to our American Airlines gate after a long security line.  We'd had yogurt when we first woke but needed something else for the 2-hour flight we were about to jump on.  My son is normally a pretty cool kid but when he's hangry (hungry and angry) I feel I've failed my mommy duties and not protected the world.  haha  Anyway, that said, I dove into Ziegler's New York Pizza really quick and grabbed a slice of breakfast pizza.  Since our plane had already boarded, I didn't have them heat it but it was still so delicious!  It was egg, cheese and sausage pizza on a sourdoughy tasting crust.  Yum!  Had I known how tasty it'd be, I'd have definitely ordered two.    We're always flying through PHX so will remember Ziegler's!  (It's at the end of the gates, btw.)  See ya there!"}
{"text":"Best airport food I've ever had. Excellent thin crust New York style pizza and a generous Greek salad at the Phoenix airport concourse B."}
{"text":"The \"Order Here/Pay Here\" layout is crappy and confusing when it gets busy. The woman at the pay here station was so rude. I said hello and asked how she was and she didn't reply. I got 2 slices of cheese pizza which was a cheap, $4.70 after tax. The pizza was good enough that I'd eat it again if I needed something quick at PHX."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome. Service was great. Had the fried mozzarella, buffalo chicken pizza, sausage/pepperoni pizza and the zeppoli ice cream dessert. Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the pizza here, it really was just like the pizza I had in New York City. Yum!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised that the sandwiches at this restaurant were cheaper than the prepackaged ones at the many convenience store-type places throughout the airport. I got the turkey pesto on focaccia for ~$8, which is pricey in general but by airport standards reasonable. Plus, It turned out to be a huge amount of food! Each half sandwich could've been one meal by itself, plus sandwich orders come with a pickle and bag of chips. In addition to turkey, the sandwich included tomato, spinach, and provolone cheese. I only wished that they held off a bit on the strong mayo-based pesto dressing. The very soft focaccia bread was oily and savory enough, so the sandwich did not need so much added fat for flavor. Grilling or warming the sandwich might also improve it. All in all, if you have a big appetite, you should get a sandwich here for a similar price as much smaller sandwiches available at other stores nearby. Sandwich orders take a bit longer than pizza orders, but I waited less than 10 minutes so if your gate is close it should not be a problem."}
{"text":"One of the best airport pizzas I've tried. Thin and delicious. Priced well per slice.  Limited seating but worth the wait"}
{"text":"I'm in airports twice weekly at the moment and it's rare that I find a spot with food worth reporting about, in transit.   I also pay rent in NYC, so I love and appreciate a solid slice.   Just demolished a slice of bruschetta pizza and a Greek salad and am astonished by how awesome both were.   The pizza was still piping hot even once I got to the jet bridge, crust was crispy, cheese and flavors, perfect. I ate a few bites, closed the box and boarded the plane.   Sat down, made more headway on the pizza-- YUM!  Decided to crack open the salad before finishing the slice, poured off extra oil from the balsamic dressing in the box (I always think there is too much oil in a dressing), topped the salad with croutons given on the side, and dove in.   I was delighted by the fresh, crunchy romain that didn't taste like a plastic bag, wonderful olives and croutons, and good feta...!   Then, I circled back to the, now room temperature pizza, and it was still amazing. Still crispy but tender crust. Still wonderful flavor. What a lovely surprise.   Can't wait to be back in the terminal 4 B11 area!  Hardly care that my flight is delayed as I write this review."}
{"text":"Friendly service and tasty pie. I try to grab a bite here everytime I fly through Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"Your name is totally disrespectful to all the NYC pizza spots that are actually good.    Pizza is hard to mess up but you figured out how.  Doughy, flavorless, piled with a mess of cheese and covered with burned left overs from the oven.  Not to mention the guy that rang me up was half asleep and acted like I was bothering him.    Please change you name, you don't deserve to use New York in your name."}
{"text":"Really really good and reasonably priced for the airport! I have a high standard for pizza and I would eat here regularly if this shop were near my house (instead of at the airport). Makes me want all my future flights to connect through PHX!"}
{"text":"Holy heck Sky Harbor has blown my mind once again. This place deserves a medal, not for the best pizza but for the best deal I have ever received at an airport. For under 8 bucks I got two massive slices of pizza that were tasty. Ziegler's NYPD Pizza delivered incredible value. The local Arizona chain is serving big, greasy slices on the cheap and besides being wallet friendly they are taste bud friendly. Ordered the Big Kahuna (ham, pineapple, basil, mozzarella) and Brooklyn's Favorite (sausage,pepperoni, basil and mozzarella). They were big, greasy and foldable and made my seat mates on the flight home a bit jealous."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite on a layover. Service was good and fast and the pizza was good also!  Pizza is a thin crust which is what I was craving."}
{"text":"As someone who frequents the B concourse at this airport I can vouch for the the quality of the pizza they put out. Is it the best I've ever had? Far from it, but compared to the sky high ( no pun intended) prices at all airport vendors, this place is a breath of fresh air! Totally reasonable and good.  I guarantee this is where most of the crews go ;) that says a lot."}
{"text":"Order an \" New York Pizza' in Phoenix airport and you get what you deserve. Truly awful. Staff overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!!!!! I ordered the chess pizza because every other meat option was either with pork or chicken - meh! But omg!! The cheese was soo yummy!!! Good amount of cheese and sauce, puffy edge w little crispy base crust...  The server asked if I wanted the special 2 slices + drink for $7  I thought two slices was too much.. Anyways I declined and ordered one slice... Half way through I knew I was gonna order another one! So delicious!   I noticed later that they also have boneless wings.. I would have tried that as well but I was already I'll after my two slices - next time! :)"}
{"text":"Pizza joint and airport don't go we'll, but this place is an exception. They sell pizza by slices and they pretty good. Next time I fly through PHX I will make it a point to stop here.  ( took a star away for the confusing menu description of the combos, u have to ask for the drink in the combo, maybe that's how they do it in New York :) )"}
{"text":"hours show 8PM closing... trekked CLEAR across airport cause reviews were good. arrived at 7:30 to find them closed and mopping up! NOT HAPPY!!!"}
{"text":"I gotta give it to them, these folks handled a line full of disgruntled airport passengers like pros! At first, I walked right by because the line was incredibly long and I didn't feel like waiting. I quickly discovered that no other food options in my terminal were going to satiate my need for Vitamin G.   The wait went by quickly, and about three minutes after I placed my order and paid, I was presented with two gloriously sizzling slices of pepperoni pizza. I loved the seasoning, someone with a heavy hand had a say in the oregano and garlic sprinkling - amen! Part of me was expecting Pizza Hut style re-heated 'za, but this was cooked to order and so very tasty.   It was shoulder to shoulder while we waited so I was able to hear the know-it-all old man behind me tell the young cashier that they should really rearrange their display so people in line can read the pizza descriptions, and also, they should be larger. That nice young cashier handled him with grace, while I rolled my eyes."}
{"text":"Best place to eat, watch some games, and drink some beers, came for spring training, and we will definitely be back next yr to this place! Great staff and very friendly"}
{"text":"I've never experienced a place with more brain-dead employees and broken processes. I purposely ordered a slice of the pizza that just came out of the oven so I wouldn't have to wait.  One person took my order and gave me a receipt (the pizza was right in front of her and she could have easily handed it to me) then I had to pay a separate cashier. Then I watched as two people walked around like zombies as slow as the human body could possibly move and my slice of pizza arrived 10 minutes later.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Probably one the best pizzas I've had! New York style crust. Very crispy. Toppings weren't greasy as expected being pepperoni and sausage. Highly recommended Brooklyn pizza. Fast service. \"Ok\" Prices"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, tasty airport food?  YES!!!!  Nice staff who are efficient, and the pizza is really really good.  One slice and a soda for a fiver."}
{"text":"This is a new place, and I haven't seen it before. I believe it used to be a chain restaurant, but it's possible I may have missed this place in the past. However, believe it or not this is quite possibly the best overall dining experience I have had at any airport.   Cost  I purchased the special, 2 special slices an a drink for just under 8 dollars. To tell you the truth, as far as airport food goes, this is a steal, because nearby you can buy a chicken salad sandwich for 12 dollars nearby.   Food Quality   The food quality here was pretty good, and better than average compared to most places. I ordered a white pizza and a BBQ chicken. Both were above average in quality. In particular, I enjoyed the white pizza with spinach because it had just the right amount of garlic and cheese. The crust also was very nice. It wasn't spectacular, but it was definitely better than others. they also have a selection of pepsi products to order. It wasn't a very extensive list of choices, but they had Sierra Mist so that's all that mattered to me.  Customer Service and Decor  Like any airport restaurant, this restaurant has limited seating so it gets busy during rush hour. One of my biggest pet peeves is people sitting and hanging out in the area when they don't intend to order anything, which happens frequently, but is something you can't control, and on my visit, I saw a lot of this because it was in the middle of a rush.   As for the customer service, it was ahem...serviceable. they were in the middle of a rush and needed to get people in and out quickly, and I thought they did very well.   For airport food, I found this place to be extremely impressive. Not only was the food cheap, but it was of decent quality, and I would definitely consider coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Stone cold panini on REALLY stale bread. Worst airport food I can recall."}
{"text":"And out of nowhere unsuspectingly a good slice of pizza at the airport. I have to say the several times I have chosen to eat a Phoenix airport has been better than any other food courts located in airports or malls.   It all started with a sample taste. Then I scurried about the terminal seeking other edibles. I came back to New York Pizza Dept and went for the whole slice. For a few bucks it was a steal of a deal to eat an an airport, and if you dare fly US Airways then you can cash in on this bonus too!"}
{"text":"Decided to try again. I don't know why. Pizza is actually okay, but the service is so inadequate that can't endorse this place. The cashier didn't give correct change and simply can't be bothered with customers, and last time, I had no cheese on my pizza. Guess I'll go out of my way to Humble Pie next time."}
{"text":"Overpriced food pizza was tasteless, the best thing about meal was salad sadly that was not outstanding just ok but for 24 dollars price for 2 slices 1 salad I should have walked to another terminal and ate."}
{"text":"A great place for a quick bite! 2 slices specialty pizza and a bottled soda for $10.05, tax included. Pizza was nice and hot, devoured in 15 minutes! Airport food is usually pricey but  these slices was worth it."}
{"text":"Good pizza for airport standards. Two slices were a little under $7, and while not as huge as non-airport pie joints, they were fairly portioned and filling. I tried a white garlic veggie slice and a barbecue chicken slice. They were pretty good, not great, but a decent option compared to the awful Mexican food next to this place."}
{"text":"I loved this pizza and its such a great deal for airport food! The ladies are super sweet and patient as you are ordering your food and deciding what slice to get and what salad! I got the Wall Street with a  Chelsea Salad. I will say for the price tis great! I travel a great deal and I eat a lot of airport food.... this is some good airport food! Get you a slice, even a good take home slice!"}
{"text":"We had really bad service......and it took forever to receive our food and pay the bill. You are in an airport restaurant--pick it up!!  People need to get to their gates--sitting for 50 minutes is not acceptable--no wonder the place was empty.  The pizza's were very good though!!   Great crust and nice and chewy dough! We both ordered personal size pizzas--I opted for the vegetarian style which included green peppers, Roma tomatoes. mushrooms, black olives and onions.  If you are not in a hurry, then I'd recommend this place for their pizzas.  It's just outside of Security so you'd have to factor in that extra needed time too."}
