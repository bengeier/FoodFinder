{"text":"When you think of airport restaurant meals, expectations are low but this gem of a dining experience is in a class all its own. Service was quick for bar service and to take our order.  At that point all forward motion stopped  (as in many other fine airport establishments).  After a two and a half inning wait - and dealing with a yelling server standing beside me I was presented with a very tough pork butt steak with a limp bit of pepper, some yougurt and a touch of dill on top. Our server explained it was \"a la carte\" but no sides appeared on the menu. When my table knife proved inadequate to the task, the manager appeared brandishing a plastic knife that he assured me was much sharper... Unfortunately I had enough of perhaps the toughest $17 piece of pork I have ever tried to eat. Miss this pretentious and underperforming dog and try  one of the more predictable chains down the concourse."}
{"text":"I went for a lunch while waiting for a connection. Nice, clean place with quick and professional service (thx Ivona). Good food, fresh and perfectly cooked (I had a grilled turkey sandwich).  Downside was that menu at the entrance does not tell you that the price does not include a side dish. Hence, I had a small green salad for 60% of the price for a main dish. Hence, sandwich went quickly from 12$ to 20$. This is why gave 3.5 stars instead of four. And I find a bottle of Corona for 7.50$ slightly expensive. In general, nice experience but at the limit of the price I am willing to pay, even at the airport."}
{"text":"So on a stopover to Ottawa. Stopped for a quick beer and burger 30.00 later what a waste. The burger arrived and finding a party was a job. Don't think about a side. It arrived with a slice of bree  and shredded cabbage. No nothing. The beer was cold and the waitress friendly otherwise walk away!"}
{"text":"imidiate seating hostess was great waitress was over loaded ordered fried chicken which was recommended was told two sides came with meal found out when the second side was not received that sides were extra almost $5 for fries the chicken was hot over cooked seemed like it was reheated very dry second piece was better but still dry very dark like it was refried ask by waitress about food told her the complaint nothing was done full charges for substandard food nice atmosphere terrible food I'm guessing they are counting on no repeat business because of busy airport environment highly recommend A&W if your looking for chicken its way better just down the concourse"}
{"text":"A jewel of a find in the Toronto Pearson International Airport, this eclectic restaurant is full of tasty dishes from a variety of influences. Truly World Cuisine with 'Twist' on many old favourites.   I had the Lightly Wilted Spinach with brown garlic and olive oil. This was so tasty I ordered a second helping for desert.  I also had the 'Picnic Salad' with green beans, almonds, blueberries, quinoa mixed with a whole seed Dijon mustard dressing.  Scrumptious!     The restaurant is the brain child of celebrity chef, television host, and cookbook author, Roger Mooking. Mooking comes from a culturally diverse background, the Trinidadian-born, Edmonton-raised chef is no stranger to combining diverse flavours to new and exciting signature dishes. While his earliest influences are his family's Chinese and Caribbean specialties, Roger has also trained under Japanese, Chinese, French, and Swiss German chefs.  Many of the dishes could be adapted to a dairy and gluten-free diet. The staff are fantastic and very helpful for those with dietary needs. My only wish is this restaurant had a second location in Toronto so people other than airline travelers had access to it.   Main menu here: http://www.gethostfacts.ca/toronto/Menus/TorontoTwistEN.pdf Breakfast menu here: http://www.gethostfacts.ca/toronto/Menus/TorontoTwistBreakfast.pdf"}
{"text":"Airport food is the worst as it is always expensive and generally lacking nutritional value. Twist was expensive but I was happy with the salad I ordered as well as a pasta appetizer. Although the price was high, the food was great. My salad was fresh and the pasta was cheesy.  The server was knowledgeable and was able to answer a question I had about the dressing. She made a good substitution suggestion for me. If I fly through terminal 1 again, I will make a point to swing by and check this place out again."}
{"text":"The place looks cute but the food was horrible. The empanadas were so gross. The lamb burger was also supper greasy. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"$3 for a coffee. Omelette came with no toast or home fries for $12. Omelette was dry and tasteless. If you like overpriced food then go here. The staff was not very attentive"}
{"text":"Quite a few mixed reviews for this restaurant but I have to say my experience was exceptional. I had a short amount of time before my flight and my food and drink (both absolutely delicious) came quickly and the server was phenomenal (friendly, fast, polite). Without a doubt this will be my first stop for a great meal next time I find myself at YYZ."}
{"text":"Had the poached eggs and polenta and it was amazing! Didn't miss bread at all ;) fresh Parmesan and crunchy bacon on top!  There was only 1 guy working at 6 am on the day I was there but he was amazing, super busy and running around but still kind and trying to please. Even when some others arrived you could tell he was the customer service guy as he was still tuning around while they were slowly walking."}
{"text":"So not that hungry waiting for a flight. I ordered the perogis and a glass of wine. Wine was great. However the perogis not so much the we're supposed to come with Chrizo, however it tasted like dry old hotdogs chunks with a little bit spice.   the manager treats the staff like crap.want to know how I know? Instead of them doing there jobs they bitched about how much things suck  to each other. I had to listen to the servers talk about the shitty things you do to them. Also change the music they hate it.  It's really hard to smile if what they say is true."}
{"text":"Reached the airport starving and needed a good meal as I'm on a flight that doesn't serve food. I prefer a sit-down restaurant so I can relax and this was my option. The restaurant looked promising and the menu seemed diverse. However, the overpriced food came in very small portions and I left hungry. The $13 pork kebab meal consisted of two small kebabs, only meat, on skewers. That's it. A side dollop of sweet potato and chopped peppers was enough for one bite. The side salad was pricey and the blue cheese dressing watery, creating a soggy meal. I left hungry. And sadly the server never even asked about the meal, so I was left to take to Yelp to have my say. Wandered down to a take out counter, where I'm having something more substantial."}
{"text":"Really disappointing. All I want is to find an average restaurant in Terminal 1 at Pearson. This one looked promising: the food looks good from the walkway, the menu is well written, the atmosphere looks fresh and inviting. That's where it all ends.   Before ordering I asked the server if there were options on the menu that could be made without wheat. He pointed to the mussels so I ordered those. 40-minutes later, the mussels came in beer broth and covered with bread... and I had to tell him that both are made from wheat.   He rushed around a bit and eventually said the mussels could be made without the beer (which was my original request) and 20-minutes later more mussels came. They were touted as \"extremely spicy\" but in reality were mild but still good (which is why I rated a 2 instead of a 1).  After eating, it took an additional 30-minutes for me to get the bill. Other frantic people were having the same \"I'm going to miss my flight if this waiter doesn't bring the damn bill\" thoughts as me. In all it was a two hour ordeal that should have been way more efficient and I didn't find an \"average\" restaurant, I found a below average one."}
{"text":"Good food(4 star), terrible service(1 star). I had the steak with carrot pur√©e and a side of brown rice. I had to get up and go ask for a server to come take my order. After I asked for the bill I also had to go to the server much later to tell her I have to get going and need the bill. They should improve on their service."}
{"text":"This is way better than Mill Steet Brewery I ate at on my stop from BOS to The Soo. On my way back today.  Had the pork shoulder at the recommendation of my server, since I was debating between that and the  DDD burger.  But I then saw 3 people get the burger and the look of yum on their faces told me I NEED to get that next time.   My pork shoulder was really good. The only downside was I had to slice it very thin but my server noticed that I was trying to do it with the metal knife which wasn't serrated so he grab me a couple of plastic knives. That worked much better.  Even though this place is gourmet it gives you big portion so you don't need to order the fries (frites) which I did and I now regret.   This will definitely be my favorite stop when I have to fly through Toronto."}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner recently while waiting for a plane. It was full and lined up but we were seated quickly. The tables are very close together so don't expect private conversation.   The wait for our food was longer than we would have expected at an airport but when the food arrived we were pleased. I had a butter lettuce, candied bacon salad that was really delicious and fresh. The wine selection was ok too. My companion wanted the lamb burger but they were  out so he had the double-double-double (it's a burger) and enjoyed it quite a bit. Somewhat of a wait for the bill and you know how it is at the airport...when you're ready to go you've got to go. So...overall, food was good, service was ok. If I was back in the Toronto airport I'd probably try somewhere else first but I'd go here again."}
{"text":"Great concept, great chef personality but here, we find mediocre food further marred by ridiculous airport prices.  Twist is a decent way to pass the time waiting for your flight at Toronto Pearson Airport if you're not picky. As a frequent traveller (often through Pearson), I'm definitely not returning here.   FOOD: 3 stars. For comfort food, this was not comforting. I suspect there is a disconnect between concept and execution.   Ordered the prime rib sandwich and \"pasta\". Sandwich was dry, with extremely little meat (you're better off going and buying a cold sandwich) and a relatively massive amount of bread. The flavours were there, but inconsistently applied throughout the sandwich due to the haphazard preparation. (See my picture). The pasta was pedestrian, and lacked depth. There was no \"twist\" or anything memorable about the dish.   The BEST bite was actually the wilted spinach. Yup. Plain old wilted spinach. Even that could have been better with more garlic. Tells you all you need to know.   DRINKS: 3 stars. Ordered sangria. In short - don't make the same mistake.   SERVICE: 3 stars. Friendly but very slow. It was busy, so hard to fault. I did notice, however, that someone's drink spilled at the table next to us, and it was me who helped her clean her table and not the server, and the server didn't replace her drink.   VALUE: 2 stars. 20$ for each main dish, and honestly, it's not much more satisfying that buying fast food. DRINKS were terribly overpriced. I won't even bother telling you the price. Just look at it and laugh."}
{"text":"First of all, ignore all the bad reviews. Seem they are mostly from rankled travelers upset that service was a bit slow or prices are a bit higher than outside the airport.  Twist simply has the best airport food I have ever had (and I travel extensively). Lunch and breakfast are both several notches above what you can find in most airports (with the possible exception of terminal 2 in San Francisco). Plus the prices are quite decent (especially for US travelers given the strong dollar).  So bravo to the chef!"}
{"text":"If you like greasy, oily - bacon & eggs breakfast then this place is for you! Everything on my plate was covered in oil."}
{"text":"Grumpy staff. Slow service. Never presented with a menu. Semi-cool atmosphere but I'm undecided on this one."}
{"text":"The good - The food looked great. The plating and presentation were really nice.  The bad - The mains do not include any sides. You have to order them separately. I ordered roasted fish, which was black cod placed in a dish with soya sauce and a lot of salt in it with a little orange zest on top and pea tendrils scattered around for visual appeal. The dish tasted awful, too much salt; no flavour except for the soya sauce. Wine was pricey; a glass of wine (6 oz) for 13.28$ and didn't taste great either.  The ugly - It was pretty hard to track down the waitress to ask for cheque. She was too busy to check on me even once. When the waitress asked how was the meal, I said I didn't like it. There was too much salt in it. She said okay. Here is your cheque. :) Wonderful. Extra points for the customer service.  Two stars just for the presentation."}
{"text":"Yeah - so funny about all the reviews about asking for the cheque...over...over...over...again. I actually came here to eat after my plane landed as I was still hungry and wanted some decent grub. I sat at the bar and just ordered wine, which by the way, for 9oz pour is quite expensive with the cheapest option costing around $16. The menu looked pretty decent but I wanted something \"healthy\" and opted for the steamed sweet potato. The guy warned me they are not fries, but literally sweet potato slices. Yup, that is exactly what I got with a side of some garlicky sauce which went really well with the orange veg.  So as it was time to wrap up, some lady asked me if I wanted another drink to which I said no, but wanted the cheque. The guy next to me also asked for the cheque. 10 minutes passed and the guy who served me asked if I wanted another drink. I repeated that I wanted the cheque and the guy next to me also asked if he could have the cheque.   I got mine, but he still didn't get his. All this is to say, kind of scary to come back here again BEFORE a flight as if you gots to go, you want that cheque asap. Thankfully I got the guy server because the two blondes were just chatting and old (not age, but just tired of life...not want to be here type of vibe).  I think Roger Mooking was in the kitchen and I wanted to see that happy, smiley chef we all saw on tv but he looked stressed. All in all, I have experienced better and wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm gonna help this place out a touch having read all the reviews and just dined here myself (literally just put down my utensils).   I've got an early flight out and let me tell ya folks, the options in T1 domestic aren't in abundance. I felt I deserved better than Tim Hortons and wasn't in the mood for fast food at A&W. I saw Twist by Roger Mooking and was pumped.   I was seated quickly at a high top table towards the back and soon after offered beverages. Coffee and orange juice please and thank you!   It's definitely a chefs menu, basic dishes merged and kicked up with gourmet elements so they're memorable (and they can charge a premium). I ordered the sunny side which comes with 2 eggs, roasted tomato something something and a turkey sausage. You can add a steak for $5, which I did (obvi).   Food came and it was exactly as described and as ordered. The turkey sausage was plump and maybe a touch greasy for my liking for still good. Great toast and eggs... We're eggs. But for me what put this over the A-OK (3 star) mark was the surprising steak.   I seldom have high hopes for breakfast steak. Ever. I've come to expect rawhide leather with a dash of pink to let you know it might have actually been alive at one point. Not at Twist. The perfectly seasoned, and perfectly cooked (to med rare) was small in diameter but a nice thick cut. The result was an easy to cut and chew juicy price of meat that essentially brought the entire experience up in my books.   The reviews in their dinner menu do worry me but from what I've experienced here personally, I'll Twist again... Like I did this summer ;) (get it).   Eatcrest out!"}
{"text":"Tried the Fried Chicken. Its definitely one of the best. My buddy got the burger and it was good as well. Server Casey was also very friendly."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I sent something back, but I did this time. Sausage on a bun was borderline burnt and the bun drenched in mustard. Meatloaf sandwich I got instead was tasteless and also full of mustard. Kitchen staff also don't seem to be aware that half the patrons can hear their conversations. I would recommend any fast-food at the airport over this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm so mad at this place that I'm typing this out on international roaming.  It's bad enough this terminal has few decent dining options other than sandwiches and fast food, this place looked decent and is the one place that offers a steak so it can't be all bad right?  I'll never know because the front of house is a bunch of nuts.  After waiting 10 minutes for a table I finally get one.... After I'm seated (ie packing away Christmas baggage , sweater, jacket, etc.  I get guilt tripped into ditching my seat loudly by another waiter because of a lady with a baby.  The hell? Kick out the loafers with laptops who are nursing a coffee and save that room for people who want to eat.  If I wanted to sit on a stool I wouldn't have waited in the first place.... And apparently they didn't have any problems with making couples with babies wait because the two parties who were waiting in front of me also had babies.  Why single me out ...    Now apparently mill St at the other end of the terminal so they'll get my business instead."}
{"text":"Want to know about the worst meal of my life?  Christmas Eve 2014 alone at Twist Restaurant at Pearson before I fly out to BC.  Unsurprisingly this place left a horrid taste in my mouth...probably from the lamb burger that had the familiar scent of my armpit post workout. The fact that this restaurant is one of the many cornerstones of Pearson's culinary revitalization boggles the mind.  I'd say I found solace in fellow horrid reviews but seeing as I had to create this destination myself that doesn't seem likely.  Enjoy the holidays everyone...I won't.  *IMMEDIATE UPDATE* 50 bucks for a burger, fries and 2 beers.? ..This meal has been redeemed by what I'm sure we can all agree is a totally reasonable price tag and 100% sarcastic update."}
{"text":"As far as airport restaurants go, this place was actually above average food-wise. Where they fell short for me was the service. The hostess, who is lovely, seated me right away, and I took a spot at the countertop so I could get some work done as well.  I waited, and waited, and waited some more, but no one came to take my drink order. Finally, after about 15 minutes, a server (who was very charming, but a bit on the fake side - he told every single person he served that their order was 'the best choice on the menu') finally took my order. I went for the pierogis to start, which were quite delicious, although the chorizo topping was a bit too spicy for me, it was a really good effort on a simple dish. I had the turkey and sage sandwich which had seasoned cooked turkey (a bit too much seasoning, but otherwise cooked really nicely!), provolone, and baby kale on a really nice wheat bread.   The food was tasty, though not exceptional. Like other people said, I would expect more from a place with a famous chef's name attached to it, but as Evelyn A mentions, we have to keep in mind, it is in an airport!   It was around $25 for the two dishes, which I thought was fairly average for an airport meal. I would only come here if you're not in a rush, as the service was quite slow."}
{"text":"Truly awful. Food not as advertised. Watery sausage on a hamburger bun (!!!) with lame coleslaw and badly over fried fries.   Servers (nice people) did not want to be there, at least from what I overheard.   I don't blame them. Very poor.  $30.00"}
{"text":"They need someone new on the hostess desk. My colleague and I wanted to have a late lunch at Twist and approached the desk. We both had carryon bags and briefcases so were  interested in a table where we could put our bags out of the way. Most of the tables are crammed in quite tightly. There was one open on the end that had been recently vacated and when asked if we wanted a table I pointed out that one. She told me that she could not sit us at a dirty table but did we want another one on the middle.  I responded that I told her the table we wanted and that  we did not mind the dirty table. There were only water glasses left on the table at this point.  All they needed to do was pick up the glasses, wipe the table with a cloth and drop new silverware. She would not budge so we were out of there and on to Boccone."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to Roger M's new restaurant opening at Pearson  - came here with a colleague. The menu looked good, interesting options and we ordered the \"sunny side breakfast\". I should of taken a photo but picture this- white eggs on a white plate - white toast and a lonely Turkey sausage that tasted liked nothing really with an odd texture, then some chopped tomatoes with red peppers and onions (hot mess), cause I don't know what that was suppose to me.  To say the least was totally underwhelmed and will not be returning for another visit."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice - wanted to like it but after a more than fair chance I'm writing it off. Today I paid $40 before tip for a steak and cheese sandwich and a chicken noodle soup.  The sandwich probably had less than an ounce of dry, seriously over cooked steak. The mushrooms, cheese and green salsa on top of the steak were fine, but there was so little substance to the whole sandwich I needed to order something else.  It was accompanied by wilted spinach -  probably the best thing I've eaten here - but a small side dish. So I ordered the chicken soup. First and foremost it was outrageously salty - almost inedibly so (I left most of the broth). The noodles were incredibly thin which I don't mind but oddly, they were very, very dry. I don't know how that's even possible. There were nice sized strips of chicken breast meat but also incredibly dry. The bits of bok Choy and the mushrooms were nice but couldn't save the soup.  I had a very nice waitress which sad to say was the only really good thing about my meal. There are other choices in the airport - all better than this restaurant. I would avoid it all costs."}
{"text":"On a 5 hour layer at YYZ - hubby and I were looking for a place with \"good\" food. We found it. We shared the empanadas and dip on chip as appetizers and the butter lettuce/bacon/blue cheese salad and burger for our dinner. The food was tasty and fresh. We would definitely eat here again when at YYZ. The bigger question is would we eat at this restaurant if it was In the city? Probably not - as nothing was \"amazing\" or crave-worthy."}
{"text":"On our way to Halifax and had time to kill. Passed a few other places and looked for a while but Twist seemed to be the most appealing and interesting. It was something neither of us had before so we though. . Hey why not   Pretty damn good for airport terminal food. Fried chicken, chopped frites, perogies,  and double double double burger.  All very delicious.  Friendly prompt service and we were in and our in roughly an hour.  Next time at pearson i would have no issues returning to Twist by Roger Mooking"}
{"text":"Needed a break and it was snowing outside, so I decided to give this place a try. Ordered the mussels for dinner and it tasted good. I loved the slice of baguette that came with it and the portion size was suitable. It was a little too spicy for me but it didn't deter me from finishing the whole thing. Service was good and staff as friendly"}
{"text":"Don't bother food is appalling.  Had pasta with what was supposed to be a ragu but really just water with peas floating in it.  Blackened chicken dry and rice undercooked.  Expensive for very bad food."}
{"text":"For airport food, this was exceptional. My steak was cooked correctly to order and the side of Perogies came hot and nicely decorated with chorizo.   It is expensive (sides are sold separately) but if you're looking for non-terrible food in an airport, I can recommend it."}
{"text":"My colleague ordered fried chicken.  We couldn't believe they served that to her..  It was totally burnt and the presentation was awful.  Looked like two pieces of dog meat.   She couldn't even eat it.   The manager was very kind and offered her something else but her appeitite was lost..  We were very excited to try this restaurant.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Ah airport food, always such a let down. Side note, I feel like there is a business opportunity here somewhere....  I really wanted to like this place (I like Roger Mooking, seems like a cool dude!) but the meal I had fell really flat for me.  I had a bit of time before my flight to Vancouver and was starving so opted to check this place out.   I chose the chef's salad with white bean dressing, an UPA beer, and a side of fries. The highlight of the meal was for sure the fries - they were crispy and nicely seasoned. My waitress (although she did warm up a bit at the end of my visit) was pretty grumpy and short. I had asked for the dressing on the side (normally I find places absolutely douse the leaves) and she forgot. Guess what, my salad was swimming in dressing and it was totally flavourless. I usually never have to add salt but did in this case to add something, anything.  Overall, definately a meh experience. I probably would not return."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best.  Had the prime rib sandwich, it was very dry.  Service was horrible.  Our waitress just disappeared and it took 20 minutes to get the bill when we found someone who we could flag down.  Generally the staff where more into the basketball game on TV than in serving customers.  The staff seem to also enjoy yelling at one another as they often did during our meal.  All in all, there are better options at the airport and I'll skip this one in future"}
{"text":"You need to expect more from a celebrity chef, especially when they put up a restaurant in a major airport.  I ordered the Short Rib Empanada for an appetizer.  The beef was good, but the wrapper was fairly gummy.    For a main, I had the Double Double Double Burger.  Two patties, caramelized onions, shredded cabbage and brie, on a whole wheat bun for around $13.  The beef was pretty dry, the cabbage was just plain, the onions were barely wilted, and the brie was, well, just brie, carrying the load for the others.  Another patron was having the Skirt Steak.  It looked quite good, and I regretted not ordering it.  Compared to the $26 slice of pizza I got at Lynn Crawford's new place on the international corridor, Roger Mooking's Twist is not bad value, if the food was kicked up a notch or two.  Sorry Roger, you're Chopped!  But I will try again later."}
{"text":"Worse service ever. Wait staff was lack luster and always in their cell phone.  I sat for 15 minutes, no one spoke to me, and I just walked off... Apparently A&W was a better option.  At least they took my order"}
{"text":"This review goes to the management not the staff.  Demotivated, sloppy staff, poor food, slow service. Are you paying these people?  Who is the leader?  Roger should be ashamed."}
{"text":"A bright, clean, modern, open decor makes for a relaxing enjoyable spot to wait for your flight.  The food is elegantly delicate in size but oh so  well made and a mouth full for the eyes as well.  The prices? Not too bad concidering it's an airport venue.  Hey you might even spot Roger horsing down a burger!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Painful service the bar, fruit flies everywhere and the place needs to be cleaned. I didn't want to have to write a longer review but it asked me too."}
{"text":"I love Roger Mooking but this slightly disappointed me!  I had time to kill before boarding my plane and my friend and I decided to eat her for breakfast.  She had the BLT and I had the farmers wife's breakfast and a frites to share. She said her BLT was very plain. I was also disappointed that my soft boiled eggs were cold, my arugula salad was too sour and the pancetta that came with it was not crispy at all. The worst part is also the fact that my bread wasn't warm either. No butter served.  The only best thing was the fried frites! It was warm and super crispy and chunky."}
{"text":"As I waiting to board my flight back to home, my stomach was begging to be fed before the 5 hour uncomfortable flight back. Searching for sustanence, the bright catchy sign called \"twist\" caught my eye. And as I look more into the menu, I figured why not, choices aren't bad and the prices looks reasonable.  The food came out fast. Perogies, fries and pasta and as stated it was appetizer size. It wasn't alot but enough to give you satisfaction. However, considering there was a chef name on the sign, I was expecting a better meal. I was wrong, the meal was no better than a fast food meal, it was bland and no flavour. The only difference was it was served on a plate and was presented nicer than a fast food meal. So, my conclusion for the food, nothing special dont be fooled by the fancy decor.  The service was a different story. It was great and was on top on filling back my water to an acceptable level. The one complaint was they brought me a plate with hair on it. Hope it's clean hair as I didnt say anything....  Overall, the restaurant could be a hit or miss. I wished my experience was better but it wasn't. No recommendation from me. Maybe I'll try again next time and Inmay change my mind."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised that this restaurant only has 2 stars! We had a five hour flight delay and had lunch here and loved it. We had the empanadas, sausage, cod, and pappardelle. Everything was interesting and tasted great. I agree with other reviewers that the cheque could have come much faster but overall this was great. We even overheard someone at a table near us say, \"My compliments to the chef\". Come on!!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was okay for how busy it was. Yelling from the kitchen expeditor was super loud!"}
{"text":"I ate breakfast at the Toronto airport here.  I ordered a vegetable omelette with a side of bacon.  I remembered to ask for cheese in the omelette and am a firm believer that every omelette should automatically come with cheese. The eggs were very fluffy and it was served very hot which is a good thing.  The vegetables were fresh and tasty.  This was an upper end omelette and I enjoyed it.  The bacon was crispy and plentiful.  The waiter was helpful and friendly.  The only small complaint I have is the wait time was about 15 minutes. I really did not mind but if you were in a hurry to catch a flight that could be a problem.  The bottom line is this restaurant is a fine choice for breakfast at the airport if you have a little time to kill."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, which makes it one of the best at Pearson  Another day, another airport. Stumbled into Twist this morning and just a handful of tables were occupied, giving off a relaxing atmosphere. Perfect as I got up at 5am.   I ordered the pancakes with fresh fruit minus the bananas. It came with real maple syrup.  Coffee and water were brought promptly and refilled throughout. Wished I had remembered to ask for milk before I seemingly added a generous amount of cream to my coffee  The pancakes were light and fluffy. Yum. I think they put the maple syrup dish in the microwave though as I almost burned myself on it. The mascarpone felt unnecessary.  My bill was brought at the right time without prompting. No rush and I read the paper on my phone for a while.  I am tired and cranky today. Thank goodness for those pancakes!"}
{"text":"Had the roasted fish paired with the sweet potato side.  Fantastic!  A bit of a haven during a hectic travel day."}
{"text":"Best airport food ever, great menu blend and very quick service... I had time for a second glass of wine before my flight.   Well done"}
{"text":"I had to fly to Winnipeg this afternoon and had lunch beforehand at Twist by Roger Mooking at Pearson Airport.  This is the second time I've eaten there.  As before, I ordered fried chicken and fries and the order came with a thigh and a breast.  The thigh had bones and the breast was boneless, which I found strange ... why not serve two boneless breasts?  The chicken was really tender and moist.  The creamy honey lime was a nice dipping sauce.  The fries were good.  It took a while for my meal to come so I didn't have a lot of time to eat it."}
{"text":"It's hard to get a satisfactory meal at a decent price in an airport. That's why the line was out the door at Tim Hortons and we ended up here instead. Should have read the reviews first but who's got time between flights? On the positive side:  Nice large plush napkins. Quick service. Tea comes in a large pot and was piping hot.  On the negative side: nothing to write home about. Breakfast menu was short and where the hell is basic old bacon and eggs?  I got poached eggs on polenta. Ok only because it came with bacon. One measly slice chopped up to make it appear to be more! That's just plain stingy. He got sausage and eggs and they brought no jam with the hard toast. Thanks a lot. The eggs were done well but hey it's really hard to screw up a fried or poached eggs.  I probably would not return here at breakfast time and would try somewhere else, or brave the crowds at good old Timmy's. Oh well, got a full belly - onward and upward."}
{"text":"Airport restaurant - meh. Nothing great, but still a decent enough spot for the airport."}
{"text":"I've definitely had better, even compared to other airport restaurants. But the options in Concourse D are a bit limited, so if you're hungry before your flight, Twist will work.  The restaurant is located at the far end of the gate. The seating area is nice and open - it's a relaxing place to kill some time. The service was friendly and prompt.  I came for breakfast and ordered the steak & eggs omelette with fruit on the side. It wasn't remarkable, but it was pretty good. The omelette had a nice amount of cheese (I asked specifically for this), and the sirloin was tasty and not too tough. The fresh fruit was a satisfying side to balance out the meal. And I'm usually not a fan of toast, but the sourdough was also quite nice.  Overall, it was a relaxing way to wake up and kill some time before my flight. Don't go out of your way to eat here, but if you're stuck in Concourse D, this is a fine choice."}
{"text":"I had an early morning flight and stopped in here for breakfast. I was really disappointed with the poached eggs with polenta and bacon. The whole dish lacked seasoning and any variety of texture. The poached eggs was the same consistency of the polenta. I was hoping to have more bacon but it only had tiny bits of cut up bacon that if you put it all back together, probably wouldn't make up one strip."}
{"text":"If there was a negative star I would give it to this restaurant. The waiters are idiots. They brought the wrong food to us twice. Then 20 minutes after our neighbors (who got there after us) got their food we were informed they were out of what we ordered. Don't waste your time or money here. There are decent pubs in either direction."}
{"text":"Service was very slow and the waiter disappeared for a long time. Had the pierogies. Bland and the chorizo was a few crumbles on top, barely even there."}
{"text":"This is a horrible place. The first time I ate here, I was in a hurry for my flight and had to leave without eating because their service was slow. This time, I decided to give it a chance since I have more time. I ordered the pasta and asked for no cheese. I was left waiting for 45 min before a plate of pale and unappetizing pappardelle was put before me (after I flagged down someone to check on my order). The pasta was lukewarm. When the waitress asked me how I was liking my food, I complained about the wait time and temperature of the dish. She offered to take it off the bill. Great, there was nothing else that I wanted to eat on their menu. Only then she told me that they were delayed because they had first made it with cheese. Really, it takes this long to cook another one?   Do NOT eat in this horrible place. I cannot fathom how this place gets away with snail service in an airport."}
{"text":"My standards are low for airport food but this place didn't even meet those. A rigatoni appetizer and a sausage main. Both were underwhelming. The sausage was bland, which is not the kitchens direct fault but still disappointing. The coleslaw included was dry and flavourless. The pasta was alright, if you douse anything in enough cheese its passable.   Service was friendly and prompt which is very appreciated in an airport."}
{"text":"I know people had very high hopes for this restaurant at Pearson Airport, but I do want to point out, it's in an airport. If it's better than a $22 cold chicken salad sandwich, shouldn't we rejoice?   This place is A-OK by me, and if I need to grab an entire meal in Terminal 1 Domestic again anytime soon, I'll be returning to Twist.   I had their pasta with prosciutto with a sauteed spinach side, and it was great. My husband's lamburger was decent and our bloody caesars hit the spot. The entire thing came to $75 which was a bit of a bummer, but again I remind myself...  Twist is in an airport."}
{"text":"I'm fascinated by all the bad reviews though it seems like many are because of wait times vs food.   Our wait time wasn't bad at all and the waiter was great.    Both my partner and I really enjoyed the food.  Probably some of the best airport food I've had."}
