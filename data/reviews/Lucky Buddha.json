{"text":"Stopped by to try the lunch special and the food was delicious! The soup is amazing! Service was great and the owner is super sweet. I love that it is local so we can go back for more."}
{"text":"first time there saturday night. the service and food were exceptional. i have been to 6 or 7 other chinese restaurants in the west valley and this is the best, my friends also agreed. we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"All I can say is Fantastic, from service, freshness to value this place is outstanding. We have been local residents for 9 years and since new management has taken over this place has shifted from 3 stars to 5 stars in our house. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The beef was tasty and tender. The chow fun was excellent! I recommend this place of you find yourself in Litchfield."}
{"text":"I find that Chinese restaurants are typically a bit dirty with tacky decor but I was immediately impressed walking into Lucky Buddha.  This place is tastefully decorated, the staff was attentive and polite and the food was tasteful and priced well."}
{"text":"Delicious! At the Wigwam resort just overnight and needed late dinner before crashing. Excellent, hot and tasty Chinese food! I loved the veggie spring rolls! I was going to dip them in sauce but found they didn't need any! I had more than enough for next night's warm ups and still enjoyed it with a smile on my face! Thank you Lucky Buddha for exceeding my expectations!"}
{"text":"NIce and quiet. The food was okay (I had Kung Pao Chicken) and the service was fairly quick. I've had better and I've also had far worse. Can't complain, but I can't really get excited about it either. Decent, but not exceptional, how's that?"}
{"text":"The new owner has upgraded this place entirely. Her staff is far more friendly. Her food is way better. My family and I walked out before with the previous owner because the waitress was rude and yelled at my son for not sitting down as he was standing up coloring his coloring book. So, we just picked up and left and never went back until we saw a sign that read under new management and we noticed the name change so we went in and we were very pleased with the food and service. We love the new owner. She is super sweet and friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent !! Salt and Spicy wings a must !! Complementary fried won tons . Pot stickers are moist , fresh and delish !! Very clean , prompt , and very friendly wait staff"}
{"text":"Awesome! Very clean quite place to dine in or out.  Nice and equal portion sizes far to menu prices. Food tastes authentic definitely recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"We get take out at least once a week form here the Food is great. Was waiting for a haircut today so I decided to get a lunch while I wait. So much food for a great price. The service is also amazing! Would recommend to anyone I know. So great to have a good restaurant with great service in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars and contemplated giving 3 was they charge you like $2 for an extra small portion of rice. We go there with a family of 3 and order an appetizer and 2 entrees. When the entrees come out they bring tow small, and I mean small portions of white rice even though there are 3 of us. Those 2 small bowls go quickly and if you want more rice (which every other Chinese restaurant I've been to gives you for free), they charge you. It's probably the cheapest ingredient on their menu yet they charge you the price to buy an entire bag."}
{"text":"The food was blan, like it was frozen.  It had made my stomach hurt and later that night I had threw up...."}
{"text":"Ordered couple of times (so far), one is for delivery and another for a to-go order. Food is delicious! Much much better than the previous Beijing place because they replaced the kitchen staff. Chatted with the owner, a sweet and friendly Chinese lady who used to own restaurants in Cali before. Me and the hubs are happy to (finally) have a good Chinese restaurant close to our house. Hopefully they'll keep up with the standards, continue to improve, and stick around longer than previous one. We'll be back for more yummies! Oh btw, their BBQ pork appetizer is sooo good."}
{"text":"Great taste.. fast delivery.. accurate order. Fresh and hot...will definitely order again"}
{"text":"Fantastic Chinese restaurant. So glad to have discovered it. Great food and wonderful service. We're going to become regulars!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place but it is under new ownership and the new chef does not compare! The egg foo young was falling apart, the veggies were in chunks and not cooked. The wontons overcooked. Very disappointing. We had FINALLY found a good Chinese restaurant and now it is gone. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Can't believe how bad this place is. We ordered wonton and hot & sour soups , tossed it out. The chicken and broccoli was fair. Since most of the Chinese Restaurants are closed on Mondays, this one should follow those hours."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food, Excellent Service! We will be back for sure! Best Crab Rangoon's I have ever eaten. Everything we tried was top notch."}
{"text":"I'm picky with chinese food and I'm pleased to say this place exceeded my expectations.  The food was fresh and very flavorful.  Something as simple as the won-tons were some of the best I've had.  The rest of the food was delicious as well.   Not to mention the staff was very friendly and attentive.  We will definitely be coming back here many times in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very delicious! I love their hot and sour soup. Prices are great and portions are big!"}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese food.  Went for lunch...good variety of lunch specials.  Had Mongolian beef, egg drop soup, rice, salad, and egg roll---all for $7.  Great price and great food!"}
{"text":"We're very excited about having a great Chinese food restaurant in the West Valley. The food reminds me of the Chinese food I could buy in New York City. Absolutely Delicious honey walnut chicken. The service was also excellent. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"the new owner is wonderful!..the food was delicious..fresh and hot...liquor license coming soon...one of our new favs for sure"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant  Arrived as they opened War wonton soup was excellent  Wife had the lunch special which was very nice  I had the deep fried prawns Server was excellent and over experience was very good"}
{"text":"I ordered chow fun combo and it was so salty just couldn't eat it and also ordered something call salt and spicy pork that's jst battered and fried but where's the pork?! That's ridiculous you charge customers for something that's half a size of a penny! All I got were battered but there were hardly any meat! I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is friendly and very fast. It is also neat and clean in appearance.  However, I was not blown away by the food itself.  I tried the cashew nut shrimp and it was just okay.  Everything was fresh and by all means it was not disgusting, but it was just kind of bland and sort of just okay.  Not bad, but I didn't think the food was anything noteworthy."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken teriyaki with steamed rice and it was delicious, Food came out fast, super affordable & great service. Will be definitely going back."}
{"text":"I placed a substantial take-out order, and not only was it delivered on time (at dinner time), but it was all piping hot! Everything was very tasty, and I would recommend Lucky Buddha in a heartbeat!!! We can't wait to try more items very soon!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. I had the Kung Pao Delight and Pork Fried Rice and it was really good. Will add this to one of the few places to get decent Chinese food in the area.  Recommend this place."}
{"text":"Horrible food Ordered the Kung Pau chicken w/o nuts and was served the Cashew Chicken without cashews. I asked about it because it had different vegetables and not peppers (not spicy) and was told it was the same thing. NOT...  My friend ordered Mongolian Beef... It was horrible as well.  Food tasted like they added liquid smoke.  I can't even eat the leftovers yuck.  We were really excited to try this place with the high ratings, but should have had clue when there was only one other table filled at dinner time."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food! They have really good lunch specials and everything is fresh. They have a unique flavor to their food and their lo mien combination is delicious!"}
{"text":"Soooo glad new ownership came to the rescue. This was our first trip for lunch and we can say \"Loved it\". We'll be back for sure ! Portions were ideal , more then enough and most importantly the quality was spot on. Give this place a try .... You'll be back . Oh yes , almost forgot .... Very courteous service. See you soon ."}
{"text":"A little slow to great me but the atmosphere is quiet and sooting and the food is very good"}
{"text":"Although they share the same phone number and space as the previous Chinese Restaurant , thats all they share. Very friendly and attentive staff.  Food was inceedible. Had the Kung Pao and the Chicken was so tender and sauce was amazing! We also ordered Shrimp Fried Rice that was delish as well."}
{"text":"QUALITY CHINESE FOOD!!   Wow, this place is: 1) delicious  2) fast and friendly service 3) clean and convenient They deliver their bomb food right to your door in impeccable time! Not to mention their food is quality. Fresh and favorable!"}
{"text":"I didn't care for their food at all.  This is cheap frozen food heated up and served. The food is mediocre Chinese buffet quality. I won't be returning, I even threw out the left overs."}
{"text":"Lucky Buddha Asian Restaurant is the best Chinese food in town, and provides excellent service. Treat customers as their own family. The decoration of restaurant is very beautiful, and it has special the Chinese characteristics."}
{"text":"We went around 2:30 on a Saturday and we were the only people there.  The lunch specials run until 3, so we ordered from the lunch menu.  I ordered Mongolian beef and my husband had Mongolian chicken.  Hot and sour soup came out first and then the lunches arrived in a bento box and included an eggroll and rice.  The portions were perfect for a lunch and, in fact, we both ended up taking some home with us. The food was above average for chinese food in the west valley.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the hot and sour soup was really boring and not really spicy or sour.  I had to add some chili oil to spice it up.  Other than that, I enjoyed the meal and will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Complimentary won tons and s&s sauce. We had crab rangoon, egg rolls, General Tso Chicken and Beef Lo Mein. All very good. Hot and fresh. Service was excellent. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. A little pricey but portions are huge so there's enough for another meal. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went in late in the evening craving some Chinese, particularly some noodles.  Was seeking some kind of combo plate but I have had zero luck with that on dinner menus in west Phoenix.  Found no lo mein on the menu either. Explained to the very friendly server my lo mein desire and she spoke with the kitchen. They made up a delicious dish with noodles, chicken, pork and shrimp. Very well prepared and satisfying."}
{"text":"We stopped by during the lunch hour on a Wednesday and noticed this restaurant was not very busy. The service was just ok, not bad but not over the top. I ordered the Sesame Chicken which was described as having a gravy however when it arrived it had a sweet & sour sauce vs. gravy. My husband had the broccoli beef which did have a nice gravy. The fried rice was good, however the limp iceberg lettuce salad reminded me more of a teriyaki restaurant.  Lunch prices are quite reasonable."}
{"text":"Black and White Pork Chop was off the chain. I'm thinking about trying Salt and Spicy Wings next time! This place is going be my favorite Chinese place"}
{"text":"Holy Cow is this place good. Our long suffering journey to find good, fresh Chinese food is over!! We had the vegetable lo mein, general tso's chicken and orange beef....all were fantastic."}
{"text":"Great service, our waitress was very friendly. And the food was delicious. If you're in the area give it a try."}
{"text":"Disappointing apps, awesome entrees!   We ordered delivery tonight, and were impressed by the quick delivery time. However, we were super disappointed, crab rangoons were burned and we received an entirely different soup than what we had ordered. That being said, the egg drop soup was good, just not what we ordered. The entrees were great though! We ordered the chicken curry and General Tso's chicken, big servings of both, and both were delicious. We will definitely be ordering again, but maybe skipping the appetizers next time."}
{"text":"I have been searching for good Chinese for a very long time around North Buckeye.  I can finally say I found a good place at Lucky Buddha.  I had Hot and Sour soup (Very Good), Pot Stickers (Very Good), Chicken Fried Rice (Good) and General Tao's Chicken (okay).  The portions were very good and the staff very friendly.  Be careful with the house made Chinese Hot Mustard for it is very good but also very Spicy HOT."}
{"text":"It's aight. Delivery was quick driver was nice food was decent... will likely order again for convenience."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place! Very clean and the staff was extremely nice.As for the food the presentation was was very nice and the food was really good and for under 20 bucks lunch for two you won't go wrong!one of the best Mongolian beef I have ever had."}
{"text":"Norma (our server) was AMAZING! The food was delicious and the customer service was even more amazing. I will be back."}
{"text":"Not awesome!  Ordered delivery and combo fried rice tasted like meats were either frozen and/or spoiled. BBQ pork slices with no sauce was ok. A lot of places miss the 'naked' request, but they got it right. Hot mustard (which can make or break pork and seeds for me) came in pre-packed sleeves and not fresh. Total bummer. They delivered on time, but satisfaction with overall food was/is low."}
{"text":"Three words for you...Singapore Rice Noodles!  I am not a curry lover, however, these were ordered by Patty and I am NOT sorry for shoving them in my mouth.  Ever since we ate there a couple of weeks ago, I have now craved it at least 4 or 5 times.  We have had these noodles at another local spot (this place is one of those counter joints though) and they are quite greasy and plain, but good.  Buddha's Singapore Noodles are anything but greasy and boring.  There is a large helping of veggies and your choice of meat.  I am not sure if it accidentally made it's way in there, but there was some shrimp in there along with the pork we ordered.  Curry goodness!!  I also quite liked their egg drop soup...even though it's still not as good as any from back home in California.  The fried wontons and sweet/sour sauce they bring to you after you order sure isn't bad either.  Mmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from here to be delivered to my hotel while I was in Phoenix. It came to my room in a timely manner and didn't have problem with delivery. There was more than enough food as I thought the soup was expensive but it was because it was a whole pint. Even though the hot and sour soup tasted good there was way too much liquid for the amount of vegetables and tofu in that pint container.  When I got to my main dish it lacked a lot of flavor and unfortunately I only pretty much ate the chicken out of it to fill me up. The 3 chicken egg rolls were decent but they were fried a little too long and the dough was pretty crunchy and tasted like used oil.  For the most part I ended up dumping the majority of the meal down the garbage disposal in my hotel room as it just really didn't taste that great.   As I said there was a lot of food and I was full when I stopped forcing myself to eat some of this $30 meal but overall I was unimpressed and wont get an order from here again when I come back to Phoenix.  Mike P"}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered the war  wonton soup and hot tea to start. Soup base salty without adding soy sauce, soup good overall, wontons could have been full of sausage and it would have been better than ground chicken.  Chicken egg rolls ok, if give them a \"C\".  Beef with broccoli was great, general tsos chicken was great, they made it extra spicy for hubby. Overall I give it a \"B\"."}
{"text":"Best foo young I've ever had, just amazing! Would recommend this restaurant for everyone. Very clean and affordable pricing. Good portions as well."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the delivery was fast! They did forget the drink but they more than made up for it when they came back out with the drinks. This place is now a must go or to go Chinese restaurant.   Definitely going to go back!"}
{"text":"Great place. Excellent American Chinese on the west side. Everything is fresh and hot. Friendly service.  Beef Q special is delicious red wine sauce with chopped ribeye Black and white pork chip is a salt and pepper pork chip."}
{"text":"After reading several of the 5 star reviews on Yelp, we thought we would give it a try. It was fantastic. The staff were prompt and courteous and we were quickly seated. We ordered the pot stickers to start with and they were really good and came with two different kinds of dip. For the main course we had Mongolian Beef and Sesame Chicken. You can always tell when a cook has a passion for preparing excellent food; perfectly spiced with all with fresh ingredients. I would highly recommended the Lucky Buddah to anyone who enjoys a great meal and any and all Foodies out there."}
{"text":"We used to love coming to this local place. It recently reopened under new management and there food is incredibly disappointing; it completely lacks any flavor and tastes very processed vs fresh. We are sad to say that we won't be back again."}
{"text":"Dirty tables, food did not arrive at table. Do not recommend! We ordered and waited for 40 minutes and food never arrived. We just walked out."}
{"text":"This place is what i believe to be somewhat standard Chinese food. We has the pork fried rice, the sweet and sour chicken, and the Cashew shrimp. I didn't feel like it was the best value we've ever gotten from a chinese place, but we did like the online ordering system."}
{"text":"The meal was absolutely delicious - American Chiense at its best.  This was my first visit to Lucky Buddha, but it won't be my last. As soon as we entered we were quickly seated, given menu's and drink orders were taken. The menu was interesting and varied. We made our entrée selection and ordered. We both decided on the Sweet and Sour Chicken, steamed rice, egg roll, egg drop soup, and a complimentary basket of delicious fried wonton strips with sweet and sour dipping sauce.  The food arrived a quickly and it was delicious. The sweet and sour chicken was moist, flavorful, lightly breaded, and not drowned in sauce like you typically would find in  some restaurants and the egg drop soup was some of the best I have had. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal.   The staff was friendly and helpful, the prices were decent, and the food delicious. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food and customer service is out of this world!!!I I definitely would recommend this incredible place !!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Choose it because of yelp reviews. Excellent choice because the entire experience was perfect! Nice big dining room and service was quick. Even on a holiday weekend. The tofu vegetable, sweet and sour chicken and kung pao chicken were so yummy. Huge portions and enough for leftovers. Pricing was very reasonable as each plate was enough for 2 people. Vegetables were very fresh and sauces were tasty. An unexpected treat, Chinese chips with sweet and sour sauce were brought out to snack on. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Alright, so first time here and I was hoping for good food since it's so close to home.  We noticed Yelp had good reviews so it was worth a try.  I had the Sweet&Sour Chicken.  I'd give it a solid B-.  A tad bland and the chicken was a little soggy.  Overall not bad.  I also had the CRAB Rangoon,  pretty good but didn't taste any actual crab, just cream cheese.  My GF had the Chicken Curry and said it was great!  She is a curry freak and she is very honest, so it was great.  She gave it an A.    Kids had the teriyaki chicken and orange chicken, both enjoyed it.     The service was awesome, such a friendly lady took our order.  We will likely be back again."}
{"text":"Used to be my go to Chinese restaurant. Guess it's under new management? Absolutely loved the hot and sour soup now it's absolutely disgusting. The teriyaki chicken I used the love? Tasteless and processed, kinda gross. The rice? Sticky and tasteless, also looks processed, tastes gross. The fried won ton strips still taste the same but the sweet and sour sauce is not very good. Sucks to say but won't be returning... hope you guys get it together for the sake of your restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is a lot but no tasty . Dinner for 4 we order the  chow fun it take long time to bring to us may be they forgot but the waitresses didn't tell us what is going on with that order !!!!"}
{"text":"Had Kung Po Delight med spicy. Was great!!!  Good Service also. Going to be me out of town Chinese spot!!"}
{"text":"First time here and we had a great experience. Starting with the greeting, wonton chips with sweet and sour they serve you as you wait. The food was really good. We ordered Happy family,  sweet and sour chicken, pork fried rice, Chow fun and egg drop soup. The staff was amazing and very polite. Definitely a place I would come back to."}
{"text":"So great!! We've been looking for a decent Chinese food place on the west side for a long time and finally found this one. We ordered take out for dinner (we have a 2 YO that doesn't have any patience for dining in) and our order was ready very quickly. The staff there is very courteous as well. We ordered the crab rangoons, veggie chow mein, garlic chicken and shrimp fried rice. All of it was great however when we order again, I think we won't do the shrimp again- just regular fried rice. It wasn't bad, it just didn't add anything to the dish. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese restaurant!  Every dish I've tried has been excellent!  Highly recommended giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great Place to eat. Food was delicious! Service was in point. It was nice and quite. We will definitely start coming here from now on. Main thing I looked for was clean dishes, good food and great service."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Liked it before, but  with the new management came new recipes.  They went from like a 5 out of 10 to a 9 out of 10 flavor wise.  Portions are large."}
{"text":"Lucky Buddha is probably one of the most unassuming Chinese restaurants I've been to in a long time... from the outside.  Inside, it's a whole different story!   The decor is nice and feels pricey, the staff are friendly and warm. The food, however is where YOU get lucky. I tried their garlic chicken, with a sweet and savory garlic sauce, the egg foo young, the chicken fried rice, and a few other items and was thoroughly impressed by the size of the portions and price. If you're looking for good  chinese, but don't want to try the mystery meat buffets or the nearly condemned whole in the walls around phoenix, give the lucky buddha a shot!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they opened. Awesome foods with reasonable price. Outstanding services! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Dilvery was fast . Food was ok to slaty . Had a migraine after eating food . Still not feeling well ."}
{"text":"If you you want great food and hospitality come here ! It's delicious and the atmosphere is relaxing."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese that just opened up !! Every thing from fish in black bean , curry chicken, generals chicken have been amazing!!! A must to check out !!! Also try the homemade hot oil made with habaneros !!!!! (Need to ask for it!)"}
{"text":"This place used to be good, new owners? Menu has changed and everything we loved is either off the menu or terrible, so sad. Used to love this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today with my wife. Food is really good. Service is great. I like the decor. It's something different. I ordered the broccoli with beef lunch special, my wife got the wonton soup. We were both impressed with the food. Will be back when I'm in the area. Keep up the goodn"}
{"text":"I really hope this place makes it. I tried the curry, however, it tasted more like a pineapple gravy (no hint of curry flavor). It was sweet, not spicy as it was described. I am not a complainer, I just don't return. It's a new place, so I hope they work out the kinks and figure out what curry taste like."}
{"text":"Ordered a few house combos and was not disappointed. Had the whole place to ourselves. Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"While I was in town, I was craving some quick Chinese food on a Monday. (Where I live in Central Washington, there are very LIMITED Asian options.) Anyways, when I looked on Yelp, it seemed like literally all the nearby Chinese restaurants were closed. Luckily, I found Lucky Buddha to be open. If you are looking for some quick Chinese food, Lucky Buddha is a pretty decent option nearby.   Since we all have something going on in our busy schedule nowadays, it is so nice to have the option to order in and pick up. The order in process was super easy and fairly quick when you give them a call. And they have your food ready in a pretty quick amount of time.   I ordered Beef and Broccoli and Egg Drop Soup To-Go. To be honest, these are the staples of quick Chinese food and they are hard to mess up. So, I was very pleased with the entree items and soup I received. The beef and broccoli was pretty tender and tasty (seasoning-wise). I like that the food was not too salty. I typically dislike food with too much salt and sauce on it. The rice I received is just regular, plain rice that tastes exactly like rice should. I personally prefer shorter grain rice (Japanese and Korean), but this is a Chinese restaurant and the longer grain rice is fine to me as well.  The egg drop soup was pretty good. I like that the soup has a little bit of thickness to it. Runny and watery soup isn't very appealing to me. I also made sure that they would add some wonton crisps in my order (in a separate baggy) for me since I like adding them on top of my soup. It is a very simple addition that makes a huge difference. I like the crunchy texture it can add to soup. Be careful, if you don't eat the wonton crisps quickly enough, they get soggy! It was very nice that the food stayed warm on my trip back to my accommodations (10-15 minutes driving) because eating cold food is never any fun.   For me, my food experience here was pretty good. They are open on Mondays, which is a huge plus to me. Their Beef & Broccoli seems to be quality ingredients, and tasty. I love their wonton crisps. They are just so crispy and tasty. And they give you a ton of food. I had leftovers for another meal. The bang for your buck is pretty good."}
{"text":"High quality food, fast service. The owner and staff are super friendly. We had pork chop, orange chicken, pot stickers, and kung pao seafood, they all taste so good. This is the best Chinese restaurant in town. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service. Lady owner is super friendly. Back and White Chop is so good (this is the salt and pepper pork chop) and the Sizzling Mongolian Chicken on a hot plate is a must-try. Large portions."}
{"text":"Not very good. Ordered to go.  No selection for kids. There was no one dining in on a Saturday night. Fried rice was just ok"}
{"text":"There was a table of four and my husband and me, and we waited for over an hour for lettuce wraps & shrimp.  The take out orders were taking for ever as we saw people come in and neve left except frustrated.  My husband loved this place but the new ownership has a lot to improve.  Not coming back.  Too many other places competition is high."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after checking out reviews on Yelp.  We were very happy we did.  The food was AMAZING.  Served hot and presented very nice. And the service was fantastic. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place received good reviews so I tried it. Ordered home delivery and have finally come to realize that we HAVE NO GOOD CHINESE RESTAURANTS in Goodyear! I'm puzzled by all the good reviews. Just sayin . . ."}
{"text":"I went to Lucky Buddha this Saturday to order take out for the fam, and the food was quick (as you would expect from a Chinese restaurant) and terrific!  We ordered the Mongolian beef, the orange chicken and the Ma Po Tofu and all were delicious, including the rices and the spring rolls.  I don't live in the west side but if I'm the area again I would definitely consider going back to Lucky Buddha."}
{"text":"Best food and great service!! I love the atmosphere and everyone always has a positive attitude. Everything on the menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"This location is VERY much open. The restaurant is under new ownership. The food was horrible. I ordered the deluxe veggies & egg rolls. The veggies we're extremely under cook..tough, and tasteless. I was warned by a customer on site that the new change was not good. She was correct. Very disappointed. I will not be returning"}
{"text":"We liked it. Had pot stickers, egg foo young, shrimp with lobster sauce  and chicken with mixed vegetables. Service is great."}
{"text":"There food is really fresh and delicious! The beef and green beans dish is my fav. Also the beef low mien. Some of the drivers at night have had issues finding my house several times even tho I live 2 mins away so I'd recommend picking up your orders but besides that I give it a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This used to be Bamboo Inn. The new owners are much more friendly. They don't carry moo shoo pork but otherwise it is you typical Chinese food menu. The lunch specials are a good deal."}
{"text":"Decided to try based on reviews- tasteless and lacking flavor. Very disappointed had to buy soup as take out doesn't include line other places (red china) and it was a waste of $6- gross!"}
{"text":"Wanted some Chinese food and Lucky Buddha has been reliable in the past. This visit was a little different... First, my place mat had clearly been used as there was some rice stuck to it. Gross. My iced tea was a little weak and I found the paper from the tea bag at the bottom of my glass... Ordered the family meal for two with veggie spring rolls, egg drop soup, fried rice, sesame chicken, orange beef, and Chinese donuts. The spring rolls were very hot (temperature, not spicy). One of the saucers that the soup bowls came on had some food stuck to it... They apparently don't check that their dishes are clean before bringing them out. The egg drop soup was fine, but I think wonton might have been a better choice. The main entree was very good and plentiful. Leftovers for days! The Chinese donuts were still raw in the middle. :( They made us new ones and they were much better the 2nd time around. But it was a rough visit overall."}
{"text":"Had a combination lo mien and garlic chicken entrees. Big portions. Very good. Would recommend."}
{"text":"A nice place, with friendly staff. A great ambiance! Food is tasty. The chicken was cooked perfect with a delicious sauce. Not expensive either."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch due to reading so many great reviews. The price was hard to beat and the portion where great. Can't really say the food was great but it was good. The place was clean and the service was good. I had the potstickers and I liked them. The fried rice could of had more ingredients but was still pretty good. The general Taos was a bit overly sweet and lacked some kick but pretty solid. I'd come back for lunch  again."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese restaurant the service is great, food is excellent and the place is as clean as a Marine barracks before the inspection of a General grade officer.  I am a regular and have never had a dish that was less than excellent.  The menu is outstanding and the wait staff is courtesy and attentive to the needs of the customer even during the RUSH period like Lunch."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. But needed a little more flavor. The soft drinks tasted like soap though my guess is they have soap stuck in there fountain. Was pretty fair cost wise to."}
{"text":"Cute little place located in a small shopping center. The employees are very friendly and welcoming. I stumbled upon this restaurant a few weeks back while scrolling through Yelp looking for a place to eat. The menu has all your basic Chinese dishes. I ordered the seafood pan-fried noodles. This was done in the dark sauce rather than the white sauce I'm used to. The second dish was the sizzling Mongolian chicken. This is a must order! The last dish was the beef chow-fun. Delicious!! I was told that soy sauce chicken, and roasted duck are also available if order 24 hours prior to pick up. I ordered the roasted duck, and I was not disappointed. Overall, it's a joint I will definitely return to when I have my Chinese food cravings."}
