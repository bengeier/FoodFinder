{"text":"Although hard to find from the street this little gem should be less hidden.  Great food all around and solid service makes the 3 min walk from busier streets well worth it!"}
{"text":"3.5/5

A quiet restaurant located on Mercer street in the Hotel le Germain. Beautiful decor and the service was great. 

For entrees, we had the bone-in pork chop, brick chicken and the scallops & pork belly, and they were all fantastic. The most memorable is probably the pork chop - despite being thick, it was cooked through and was still juicy. 

The apps and dessert, however, were quite underwhelming. The crab cakes reminded me of a filet-o-fish and the sushi pizza was more of a sashimi cracker. 

I would recommend Victor based on the quality of the entrees, but temper your expectations for the other courses of the meal."}
{"text":"Was staying at Le Germain Hotel so are here one night.  It is very good & the restaurant has a nice casual mellow ambiance. Service is excellent like at the rest of the hotel. I had the scallops with pork belly which was delicious. We began with the braised beef poutine which is also worth a try. Even if not staying at the hotel this restaurant is worth a try. In a great location for pre theater dinner or before a Second City show."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my wife before a show at the Royal Alex theatre on a Saturday night.  Very nice ambiance.  There were only 6 to 10 people in the restaurant at any one time during our meal which made it quiet enough to have a conversation.  Service was very good.  The menu is not very large but the options were broader than I expected.  Happy Hour drinks from 5-7 every night include house wine and draught craft beer.  We had the grilled calamari and perogies as appetizers.  They were both excellent with the perogies being our favourite.  The main course was Pan Seared Scallops for my wife and Strozzapreti with braised short rib and tomato ragu for me.  The pasta was made fresh and the sauce was outstanding.  Portions were perfect sizing.  We had the trio option for dessert which allowed us to try all three of the desserts.  All were excellent.  I am glad we did I this as it would have been a shame to miss out on any of them.  Prices are reasonable for a hotel restaurant.  I would recommend this restaurant and would return."}
{"text":"First of all, all those that gave this place a bad review, you're crazy and petulant.
Victor's Restaurant deserves all the praise it gets and then some.

I made reservations for my wife and I for Saturday at 7:30pm recently (Oct. 25/14). It was her birthday and I wanted to treat her to something special, we were NOT disappointed.

First impression is just WOW.
The decor and ambiance is perfect, the service staff very good, friendly and attentive. 

We were seated and presented with the menus.
I had decided ahead of time that I wanted to try their tasting menu, and I know my wife LOVES lots of little dishes so she can try a lot of things without having to fill up.

We decided that we were going to both do all 7 courses of the tasting menu and when we told this to our server, he kindly explained that even though this is a \"tasting\" menu, the courses themselves were appetizer size, so 14 dishes would probably be way too much for us. Talk about honesty! Most places I know would have let you order all that food just so they can make more $ from you.

So my wife and I picked out 5 of the 7 dishes we really wanted to share preceded by 6 oysters, drank our cocktails and  waited with much excitement.


First we received a wonderful couscous Amuse-bouche which was just right, followed by the oysters with a fantastic mignonette which really elevated the experience.

Following the oysters we got our first 2 tasting menu dishes, the Samosas and the chilled spiced pork.
Simply saying \"delicious\" would be the understatement of the century. The dishes were both complex and simple. It was just wonderful how everything tied in together. My wife still can't get over how great the Samosas were, her favorite dish of the night.

The 3rd course was the de-constructed fish tacos. For me, this dish was ridiculous in how good it was, by far my favourite. The tuna melted in my mouth, the tortillas were perfectly crisp, the pickled vegetables, amazing. If someone was to tell me I can only eat one dish for the rest of my life, this is what I would choose.
I normally don't even like fish tacos at all, but to call this dish a fish taco is like calling the Mona Lisa a doodle.

The 4th course was steamed fish Callaloo which was gentle and delightful followed by the 5th course of roasted cépes and an amazing duxelle. Both dishes, a home run.

Through out the night our server explained not just all of the dishes, but also each component of the dish, his knowledge and explanation of all our questions was very insightful.
I had also let him know that if was my wife's birthday and he had arranged for a delicious and absolutely stunning desert trio (which they didn't even charge us for!! Unexpected and totally amazing)
Having a service background (15 years as a server) I know what good service is and usually pick apart every little detail when I go out (though not out loud :)).
Our server this night was the best I'd had the pleasure of being served by in a long time. 


Overall, the food, service and venue are all top notch.
The prices aren't just reasonable for what you get, they are a steal!
I will most definitely come back here again and again and strongly recommend this hidden gem to everyone that will listen."}
{"text":"I went to Victor for their Iron Chef experience dinner, which was very unique and fun. 

Iron Chef at experience at Victor Restaurant allows you put their chefs to the test based on the way they incorporate one theme ingredient into their dish. The group I was with selected a theme ingredient which had to be incorporated into every course (each course prepared by a different chef). Our group had to judge each course based on the way the theme ingredient was incorporated, the originality, etc, and select the best chef at the end of the night. And our theme ingredient was chocolate! 

The restaurant itself isn't large. It has a very intimate atmosphere and inviting decor. We booked the entire venue for the occasion (group of 50), which was a corporate event. I believe the restaurant sits around 50-60.

I was quite sceptical about the whole experience at first given that our theme  ingredient wasn't something that comes to mind when I think of a main course or even an appetizer but it turned out to be exceptional. The chefs at Victor were truly creative and didn't lack in originality. 

We started off with a cauliflower soup with white chocolate - simply wow! 
The second course was deconstructed tuna taco with chocolate beans. This dish is offered as part of their regular menu - minus the side of chocolatey beans. Tuna was very fresh and it literally melted in my mouth. They serve it with chips, Guac, beans and other typical sides. Everything tasted really well and the chocolate beans really pulled all the flavours together. 
Our main was a lamb dish which was impressive and very innovative. This course was not party of their regular menu hence I will not go into detail.
Lastly, we finished off with a superb chocolate mousse dessert which was very delightful, perfectly sweet (not bitter sweet).
Each course was paired with a glass of wine from their regular wine list. Although their wine list is quite short and their selection of wine by the glass is quite limited, the wine that was offered was of good quality and I really enjoyed it. There was a white Austrian white which I particularly liked.

Overall the Iron Chef dinner is a unique  way to celebrate a special occasion (ie engagement party) or entertain clients and provides an unparalleled experience with a wow factor. I highly recommend Victor's team for your next corporate event or your special occasion. Your guests will be wowed!"}
{"text":"Located in Hotel Le Germain, so no suprise that it is outstanding!  The food is delectable - everything I ordered was exceptional.  Unfortunately they had a coconut creme brûlée. I say unfortunate because I ordered it EVERY night I was there. They even let me take it to my room to finish. The staff was friendly and attentive. This is a MUST for anyone looking for amazing food and chic ambiance in Toronto."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. Generous portions and great for client meetings."}
{"text":"The staff at Victor's are so kind and welcoming. The portions are good, the food is exceptional! would highly recommend a dinner of side dishes. The smoked mac and cheese is to die for. The tartare is also so fine and so delicious. The drink menu is also exceptional. Definatly coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and service.  The share plates are big so choose wisely! Loved the pork belly tacos but the moroccan lamb shank was a little disappointing considering the other reviews. Great date spot."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a beautiful and classy environment, with a room perfect for a large party private dining experience. It is on the business casual/dressy side, but we were casually dressed, and was not treated any differently. The service was really good, and the waiter was friendly, and went above and beyond for our simple meal. They have a long wine list, and the waiter is very knowledgeable. 

Surf and Turf (Saturday Special - limited) |$30|: The steak was done to perfection, and the shrimp at this amazing flavorful smokey taste. If you have a big appetite, or just have a regular man's appetite, go on Saturdays, and get this special!

Roasted Branzino |$28|: The fish was soft, moist, and flakey. The skin was cripsy and flavorful. It also came with fingerling potatoes, which were average, and braised kale, that was a big on the bland, and oily side. It was a well assembled dish though, where each element was needed to balance each other. It's hard to explain. 

Dessert: I can't remember what it was, but it was a cake of some sort, with caramelized banana, with salted caramel, and some sort of ice cream. It was DELICIOUS. 

I would definitely go again, try some signature cocktails, and appetizers, especially the poutine!"}
{"text":"Really nicely planned and executed menu, with casual yet professional service. Food from  starters to dessert was consistently spot on. However, if you take a window seat late in the evening, be prepared to be distracted by the never ending parade of club going kids..."}
{"text":"We came for an evening dinner during our stay in Toronto. I was hungry. My husband was not. The place is intimate and beautiful and has lovely low lighting. Our waiter was prompt and very knowledgeable (sorry I forgot his name!). He was easily able to recommend wines and dishes from the menu. I ordered the Strozzapretti pasta with short rib and tomato ragu. It was very rich and warm and satisfying but I found it slightly tangy/acidic. The waiter also brought out an amuse bouche of beats and goat cheese I believe, and it was divine. The portions are good and the price is good for how elegant the place is. Finally, I like how they have specials for every night of the week."}
{"text":"Victor Restaurant is the perfect accompaniment to the elegant and gracious Hotel St. Germain. 

It's an intimate restaurant, with a lovely bar and friendly professional service. They have a nice and unique selection of Signature Cocktails! 

They've since taken the Steak Tartare off the menu, but it was probably the best I'd ever had, with a pleasant twist. 

I'd love to dine here again and would recommend Victor to anyone looking for a lovely dining experience--perfect for an anniversary or birthday with just the two of you."}
{"text":"Tasting menu is cool. It encourages social dining.

Dishes were inspired by the various neighborhoods in the city. 

Vietnamese - Gerrard and Broadview
crisp pork belly, picked vegetables, pate, deli meat, spiced mustard and crouton

Japanese Village - Richmond Hill 
Sushi Pizza, crisp rice, lobster salad, tuna, roe, avocado, and wasabi-miso dressing

Little Italy - College and Clinton
Albacore Tuna crudo, sundried tomato, basil, capers and celery

Chinatown - Spina Ave
Braised 5 Spice Duck congee, cashews and fried shallots

and more.. (this is what we ordered)

We ordered 5 dishes (doubled up on the Japanese Village) and shared. I enjoyed each one of them. They were a culinary delight. 

The restaurant is located on Mercer St, inside the swank Hotel Le Germain. Capacity of the restaurant is 150 people. The interior appointments are contemporary and modern. Nice lighting, design, and layout. 

Wish the staff was a bit more attentive I had to constantly go find them and the food took a bit long to prepare. 

Fair warning though don't come here hungry, the food will not fill you up it's really just for sampling. However it's taste was excellent!"}
{"text":"Awesome meal last week on a night when the menu was being changed and tested. The chef even accommodated a change for me.  Service was good, food tasty with a wonderful after taste and cocktails smooth. Ambiance in the rear made the evening, the high ceilings and mellow music topped it off.  I recommend highly the themed toronto dishes. Michael"}
{"text":"Took my sister her for lunch for her birthday during TIFF. We walked in, asked for a menu, and decided to stay. As the waitress walked us to the table, I almost fell over, the floor had heaved, and the waitress didn't warn us. After I commented on how dangerous it was, she said, yeah, we should watch our step. 
Sat down, ordered a glass of wine. I asked the waitress if the calamari was a lunch sized dish, and she told me it came on a salad and was great. 
So I ordered it. There was only about three tables, but it took quite a while for our food to arrive. When it got there, there was one little piece of squid on a couple of thin slices of tomato, tiny squares of cucumber and a few strands of endive. For $17, I was not thrilled. My sisters food was good, cold, but tasty. Waitress was inattentive, and quite frankly, in a restaurant in a hotel the caliber of the Germain, I expected much more. Lunch was over $85, and I felt ripped off."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this restaurant! The food is phenomenal and the staff are the absolute best! I proposed to my girlfriend at Victor and the entire evening was so special. After I proposed, my server came and took pictures and brought us complimentary champagne. She also asked where we were staying after I told her this was our first time in Toronto. She ended up (without my knowledge) calling our hotel and telling them the great news. Due to her call, the Thompson hotel left a handwritten note in our room and a bottle of champagne on ice. These kind gestures by our server and by the Thompson hotel made our night extra special. I feel so blessed to have found such a wonderful place with wonderful people. 

P.S. I recommend the burger, it is truthfully the best burger I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was friendly. We had scallops with carrot purée with lentils and mushrooms. Scallops had a nice sear and flavors were good. Also had a couple of crab cakes, that were loaded with crab."}
{"text":"I went there with my gf for a week day after work dinner*

Its not easy to find however it may be a good comfortable reason why its not jam packed* 

We tried their curry soup which we both couldn't finish a shared portion because the taste was too strong and spicy* my gf had a pasta which was average and i had the seared scallop that did not wow me*"}
{"text":"Definitely not my favourite places to eat in TO. Atmosphere is nice but service is sub par. Waiter was quite rude. He took our order incorrectly but insisted that my friend was the one who made the mistake. I ordered the surf and turf (medium rare). Both the steak and the lobster were overcooked and chewy. To top it all when we were leaving, they didn't even offer to return our costs from the coat check. We had to get it ourselves!! And they have one bathroom for men and women so you need to stand for hours! You would think a place charging $29/plate on average would at least have proper toilets!"}
{"text":"We sat down here for a quick snack before a Nobu meeting. The food and drink were delicious. Highly recommended. I had a caeser drink and a club sandwich. Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"Both the boyfriend and I had mixed reviews about Victor.  Don't get me wrong, the place is goregous with lovely decor, located in the Hotel Le Germain.  Definitely more of a romantic setting.  But the service that was provided was awkward?  The server we had did not introduce himself to us when he first seated us.  Then he went on to introduce the specials of the day but was reading it from a piece of paper?  After we decided on a bottle of wine and getting the Buck-A-Shuck that they offered on special for the day, we asked to keep the menus to continue deciding on what other items we'd like to order.  He presented the wine very professionally and even had both us of taste the wine before deciding if we liked it.  But then a couple minutes later, he came back to let us know he'd take away the menus so we could have more space on the table for the oysters?  (How do I decide on what to order if you take away the menus?). When we the oysters came, they were very tiny in comparison to all the other places that I've been to that offer a Buck-A-Shuck, so that was a little disappointing.  We were also offered a complimentary pancake-type appetizer, which I was not too much of a fan of.  After eating the oysters, we had to ask our waiter for our menus to continue reviewing the menu.  We decided to go with their Grilled Calamari and the Vic Burger with a side of fries.  I thoroughly enjoyed my Grilled Calamari and the boyfriend also enjoyed his Vic Burger although he said that it was not medium-rare as he had originally requested for.  Another thing that I found weird was that they shared the washroom with the foyer of the hotel.  Overall, I'd say it was an enjoyable date night but other than that, it wasn't anything that I'd want to come back for."}
{"text":"VICTOR Restaurant + Bar is located inside the chic Hotel Le Germain; tucked away on Mercer Street, it is literally a \"hidden gem.\"  I imagine many celebrities who want some privacy would love to dine here; I just enjoy the relaxing atmosphere, attentive service and delicious food that former Top Chef Canada competitor David Chrystian churns out of the kitchen.  While he didn't ultimately take home the prize - his dishes are winners for me.

The ambiance is laid back but sophisticated as giant \"lampshade\" fixtures loom over each table and large windows with tucked draping makes for great people watching.  

Chrystian's tasting menu pays hommage to the many ethnic neighbourhoods and streets that call Toronto home.  Each dish on the tasting menu is $14 which is a bargain for the top notch dishes offered.  There are no preset number of courses, which makes this one of the most versatile tasting menus in Toronto (it's pretty much à la carte dining if you ask me, except dishes are tasting menu sizes which allows you to try more without overindulging).    There is also a regular dinner menu available which include offerings such as lobster bisque, Berkshire pork loin and à la carte sides.

My best friend and I end up choosing to go the tasting menu route and we had no regrets!

LITTLE ITALY, COLLEGE AND CLINTON, roasted squash + gnocchi   - This dish was absolutely delicious!  The cubes of roasted butternut squash were nicely seared on the outside, but perfectly soft on the inside which actually also mimicked the texture and flavor of the gnocchi as well.  Think of the texture of a really good pan fried taro cake - that's what this dish was like.  I daresay this is my favorite plate of gnocchi in the city at the moment!

LITTLE PORTUGAL, DUNDAS AND BROCK, Lobster + Chicken Cataplana  - This Portuguese equivalent to the Spanish Paella was a blast of flavor.  The Chorizo was not in its familiar sausage format, but were what I would call cured cubes.  The lobster was chunky and tender and the kale chip was a nice touch.  The dish was slightly tangy which no doubt helped cut some of the usual richness inherent in a Cataplana.

LES MISERABLES, THE PRINCESS OF WALES THEATRE, Duck Breast \"A l'Orange\"  - The \"orange\" part of the dish is subtly incorporated into the veal jus in the form of marmalade which made for a nice glaze and intensified flavor.  The duck breast was scored perfectly and its crispiness was akin to that of biting into a piece of roast pork.  The only thing I wasn't really fond of were the turnips in this dish as I felt it didn't really go with the other components of the dish, but that's just me.  I don't think I've had duck breast with a crispy skin quite as addictive as this one!

LITTLE POLAND, RONCESVALLES, Cabbage Roll - This is Chrystian's take on a family recipe and is probably the freshest cabbage roll you'll ever taste.  The piece of beef tenderloin is delicate, tender and cooked perfectly.  But while the cabbage roll is delicious, the beetroot horseradish definitely steals the show!

KENSINGTON MARKET, AUGUSTA AND ST. ANDREW, Moroccan Lamb - Of all the dishes from the tasting menu, this one was the winner!  I guess that's why they say \"save the best for last?\"  The lamb sausage was succulent without being greasy, and the spices definitely made it pop.  The chickpeas were to-die-for - it hits up the sour, sweet and salty profiles with precise proportions of each.  This is haute comfort food at its best!

For desserts we decide to opt out of the Fall Tasting Platter (in essence, a sampler of the four desserts offered) and end up opting for full-sized portions of:

Little Jamaica (Eglinton and Oakwood) \"lemon tart\" $10 - Whoa Nelly!  You can never go wrong with coconut but I loved this dessert.  The lime curd was just the right amount of tang, and the shortbread was light, crisp, and airy (thank God as the traditional kind would've sent me into a coma).  But the simplest things in life are often the best; case in point the caramelized pineapple was the star of this dish.

The Parkdale (Queen and Ossington) chocolate tart ($10) - The tart base was divine; not too heavy.  The chocolate filling was also good - not overly sweet nor heavy.  The cherries were definitely intensified with the addition of booze and the Chantilly made every bite a perfect spoonful.

VICTOR definitely makes the rotation.   Chrystian does a really good job at highlighting the many ethnic communities of Toronto.  He's not shy on flavor as each dish is well-seasoned and delicious; it's not just a bunch of sloppily thrown together dishes using iconic neighbourhoods and ethnic ingredients to reel you in only to be disappointed with medicore, pseudo ethnic dishes.  

You even get a little take-home treat; I'm just glad it's not the usual tacky fortune cookie you get in Chinatown ;) And while my philosophy that restaurants attached to hotels generally are pitfalls to avoid - VICTOR is definitely an exception to the rule."}
{"text":"Me and my friend are from out of town and were bouncing around the city for NYE. We stumbled upon this place on our way to our destination and decided to come in for a drink. The restaurant is located inside the Hotel Le Germain and I loved every bit of this place. The decorum of this place was phenomenal from the setup of the tables to the bar. They had a great selection of scotch and vodkas to choose from. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the area and all the local hotspots. This is a great place to bring a date or come for a happy hour drink. I will definitely stop in for dinner sometime if not more drinks. Make sure to put this place on your must do list."}
{"text":"We reserved the table on their website and got the confirmation.  Upon arrival, we were told there was a private function and we got kicked out..."}
{"text":"In the swank domain of the Hotel Le Germain, Victor occupies what was once Rain's Italian sister, Luce.  Under new ownership and culinary skills of David Chrystian, Victor strives to satisfy Toronto's (and out of towners) craving for the latest locavore fare.  
It prides itself on sourcing from local Ontario farmers as much as possible and for emphasis on fresh seasonal dishes.  

We arrived on a Friday night to a surprisingly empty room.  I was somewhat disappointed to notice that while the menu was decidedly local, the wine list suffered from a lack of Ontario wines.  Surely, wine and food would go hand in hand on a localvore menu.  

Service got off to an awkward start but was quickly redeemed to be quite good.  

As for our food, delicious but for two quite major missteps.  Someone in the kitchen has quite a heavy hand with the salt as both me and my friend found the fish way too salty which ruined an otherwise beautiful dish and nice cut of black cod.  
Second misstep, after having a little deliberation, the striploin was ordered on the rarer side of medium-rare but turned up at our the table on the well side of medium.  Recognizing our disappointment, our server offered to take it back and another piece be prepared to our friend's liking.  Reluctantly, we agreed as we didn't want to be too much bother.

A word about ambience, it seemed that Victor was unsure of what it wants to be.  It's a very elegant room, with a gorgeous feasting table but the hockey game above the bar and the slightly too loud lounge music made you wonder whether we were at a sports bar, casual eatery? or was it a nice restaurant.  It's as if your rumbunctious little brother suddenly takes over room after you've moved out.  It was just as well since we almost had the whole restaurant to ourselves and could just chill and chat to no abandon."}
{"text":"Great place close to downtown entertainment district.  Great food, service and ambiance.  Went on $1 oyster night.  Oysters are from PEI (we are from Cali and are used to west coast ) but were quite fresh and tasty.  There is a special every night.  Check their web site."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant inside the St. Germaine hotel on Mercer street. We came here for a birthday dinner with a group of 10 people. This restaurant apparently recently underwent some changes and menu revamp. We were seated at a long table in the back of the restaurant. It was in an area where they had private functions, had their own sitting area and bar. Our server was new and didn't know the wine list and couldn't answer any questions on the wine list. At one point the server left us to ponder the wine list but he took the wine list with him and we had nothing to at. He came back with information that he obtained from the bartender and gave minimal information on the wine questions. We ordered wine and various appetizers and entrees. We were given amuse bouche of potato au gratin. The braised beef poutine was baked and way over processed and tasted like salty gravy over fries. Crab cakes were tasty with nice accompaniments but the crab cakes seemed pre made. The nice cut of Berkshire porkchop was completely wasted. The cut was thick but undercooked. Two people ordered the porkchop and everyone left at least half on their plate it was unedible. The porkchop was crispy and slightly charred outside but rare as sashimi inside. Looks like someone blowtorched it to crisp it up after cooking. The Saturday special surf and turf was hangar steak with shrimp, basic and mediocre. One person had fries missing from their order of surf and turf. The only star of this meal was the scallops and pork belly. This was a very good interpretation of this duo with puréed curry cauliflower and pickled cauliflower and sunflower seeds on the side. Dessert menu was presented to us after dinner and everyone ordered dessert. The server missed one order and someone went without dessert. We were never asked if we wanted coffee or tea. Overall nice restaurant and ambience within beautiful hotel but service was terrible and food nothing memorable. The restaurant was under staffed there was only one bartender and our server, later on there was another girl in the restaurant assisting. Won't be coming back here anytime soon. Two star food and service but three  if you include the surroundings. Also want to add that I got hives within 2 hours after eating dinner there. I normally eat seafood without any issue but it happens to me when the seafood is not fresh."}
{"text":"Only came here for drinks but ended up ordering a late dinner. 

Victor is located inside the Le Germain Hotel. It's a very nice venue, the entire hotel itself is pretty sweet, overly packed but can you blame them. It's a wonderful place. Food came out in a timely manner about 20 minutes. 

We first ordered a couple of double shot whiskey on the rocks by the bar then moved along to food. 

Dinner : 
Roasted Branzino ($28) 
It was a beautifully cooked piece of fish with fingerling potatoes, braised kale and lemon pistou. 
Pan-Seared Gnocchi ($20) 
Wonderful vegetarian option with brown butter mushrooms, sage and pecorino cheese, tasted so good, I wish the portion was larger haha"}
{"text":"We ended up sneaking in for a night cap just at the place was closing. This was actually after we left a venue just up the street on Mercer, which we did not have an excellent time visiting (see most recent review). Victor has a very beautiful atmosphere, the decor is just gorgeous. People watching here is also very interesting as well.

My boyfriend ordered a craft beer and I ordered a dirty Martini made with Tito's Handmade Vodka (if you haven't tried this stuff yet, you really should!), with extra olives. Order yourself a \"dirty Tito\" next time you go lol delicious!

Since the kitchen was closed we did not have an opportunity to try any of the food. Next time I come back, I would LOVE to try the food here ;)"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Went here for breakfast and ordered off the menu instead of the buffet. Waited 30 minutes for our breakfast. It came and everything was cold. The waitress never came to check on us to see how the food was. When the bill came, they overcharged us.

We told the waitress that the food was cold and not enjoyable. She gave us a hard time and told us there's a lot of other places we could have gone.

Won't be going back here"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, quick service and delicious food. Amazing happy hour $8 wine (but the server didn't know what kind) and $5 beers.  $1 oysters and the brick chicken with greens and Mac and cheese was so delicious. Would come back again."}
{"text":"I ventured to Victor for a wedding and got to meet Chef David Chrystian.  I felt like a giddy kid seeing Santa during the holidays.  He was shucking fresh oysters for us and i got to chit chat with him.

At the wedding we had a 7 course meal.

Sharing Plate- Cheese, Sausages, Salami, Prosciutto, ratatouille terrine 
Salad- pickled cucumbers, yellow tomatoes, hummus
Pasta- butternut squash ravioli with fried capers and the yummiest Parmesan i have ever had. 
Fish- Swordfish recommended by the Chef himself, excellent.
Meat- a duo of Bison tenderloin and Beef short rib.  the Bison was out melt in your mouth.
Sorbet- by then the wine was hitting me
Dessert- there was a mix of a lot of stuff but the shots were going around.  It tasted devine though :)

All in all i was very impressed by the staff, the Chef, the food, the drinks, the company, the whole night."}
{"text":"I went to Victor in hopes of having a delicious meal for my friend's birthday. Given that the chef was the runner-up of Top Chef Canada, I was fairly confident in my choice. However, upon arriving, I was at first struck by how empty the restaurant was on a Saturday night at 7:30! We nevertheless sat down and I ended up having the following:

Beef Carpaccio - decent, nice thinly-sliced beef but lacked flavour overall
Little India Samosas - flavourful, but cold as though they had been sitting around for awhile
Sushi Pizza - good, but nothing mind-blowing
Lamb Pappardelle - easily the best thing I tasted all night - would recommend this dish!
Yorkville Taster - just decent
Burger - once again just decent. The burger also didn't come with cheese despite the fact that we asked for cheese (extra $2)

Overall, the food was quite decent, with the exception of the lamb pappardelle which was delicious. The main issue was that we waited SO LONG between each course! I couldn't believe how long every course took to come, especially since the restaurant was almost empty! No matter how good the food was, I simply could not come back to this restaurant based solely on how slow the service was. It was really a shame."}
{"text":"I thought maybe the place was named after Victor Hugo or the protagonist of  Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Apparently it's named after a family member. 

My beautiful GF took me here on a 1,000 point Open Table night. The real hit of the night was the gnocchi. The clam chowder was nearly tasteless. Big points for complimentary sparkling water. 

Very long wine list although only a few by the glass. This is a swank place. Put on your best. So I'd imagine many people might not be cheap and order a nice bottle or two.

It's small, dark, intimate. Service is attentive. A good off the beaten path (who even walks down Mercer?) place to take a date you're really trying to impress."}
{"text":"Checked this place out after seeing several recommendations on Yelp. This did not meet the high expectations I had for the restaurant. 

Firstly, the food was not bad. Everything we got was fresh but there really wasnt anything special about it, there are several places where you can get just as high quality food, at a cheaper price. The service was pretty bad. For such a small restaurant I would expect service to be fast and attentive. Our waitress hardly checked in on us and was quite late at delivery drinks and the bill. The only upside to the night were the cheap drinks, we got there just before happy hour ended and got two glasses of wine. Finally the restaurant was not crowded or loud either, so it gets points there as well."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Excellent wait staff.  Perfect Mother's day dinner.  Steak Tartare app was seasoned nicely, and the toasted baguette with it was nice.  The brined cauliflower with caraway seeds that came on the plate were a little odd, but that's a minor gripe.  Trout was moist and carrot puree delectable, and the Vic Burger had an excellent cook on it with a nice pink centre.  The caramelized onions were beautiful with their sweetness adding another level.  Burgers don't have to be boring!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue! Tried their Iron Chef inspired dinner with Foie Gras as our main ingredient. It was 5 dishes for $95... 
- Portions were super tiny and each dish was served after 20 minutes or so of waiting. After the dinner, we were all starving still as ended up eating $3 street meat along King St. 
- Two dishes were a hit with the group - one that was eggs benedict fois gras and the dessert at the end was a foie gras biscuit. Another dish at the beginning was a foie gras paste that I liked, but not everyone else in the party enjoyed it. 
- The other two dishes were mediocre... One with scallop and one with steak strips.
- In the end, based on the scorecard results, the foie gras biscuit won and the chef came out to greet us. 
- The experience was fun and unique, but was pricey considering the portion sizes and quality. We would've preferred to have gone to George for a 5-course tasting menu with awesome seared foie gras instead. So probably wouldn't come back for the Iron Chef menu unless someone was dying to try it. Would consider checking out their main menu though. 
- What really impressed us was the level of service. There was a mix-up where they hadn't accounted for one member of our party. They realized after the first dish was served and one was missing. They apologized profusely and also gave us two additional bottles of wine complimentary! We already ordered 2 bottles previous, so there was A LOT of wine to go around! That made the whole experience worthwhile. 
- The place looks gorgeous too with high ceilings and a nice dark atmosphere."}
{"text":"All the mains are overrated. Food is not worth the price. Service was slow even with only 3 other tables occupied late night.

Bonus points for opening late, I suppose. Probably more suited to business lunches/dinners as opposed to dates and personal occasions."}
{"text":"The tasting menu is absolutely amazing.  The moroccan lamb with chickpeas was savory and tender, and the grilled octopus panzanella was tender with just the perfect amount of buttery crispiness .  The chicken fried rice was slightly oily but it's fried rice so that can easily be forgiven; plus, the chicken thight was very juicy and I LOVED the plethora of vegetables!  And don't leave without trying the sushi pizza, with a creamy wasabi-dressed lobster salad, roe, rice crispies, and avocado.   It's a flavor explosion.  The ambiance in Le Germain is unsurpassed and the service is top-notch.  Grab some espresso in the library afterwards and just relax with friends, to complete a great night.  A must-visit in Toronto, for sure.  There's a reason why Top Chefs are, well, top chefs."}
{"text":"Overall my wife and I had really good experience at Victor. The only drawback was that I after confirming with the waiter that my curry meal is not spicy, I've ordered it and it ended up being very spicy. However I want to thank the waiter for not charging me for my meal since I couldn't finish it. Other food, wine, and service were really good."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Went there for a causal dinner. Perfect for a romantic gateway in the heart of the entertainment district. Small but very cozy.  And the food were amazing. We ordered a crab cakes as a starter, then chicken and pork chop as entrees. For dessert we have strawberry vanilla cheesecake and chocolate mousse. Simply delicious. Must try."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and music to vibe too! I love it here! Perfect gem on an unassuming street! A must-go!"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant on a Monday with a group of 5 friends. We were able to get a reservation quickly and without trouble via OpenTable (even got bonus points). When we arrived the restaurant was mostly empty. It feels like a high end restaurant so not a bad place for a date as the tables have candles and there a nice ambient atmosphere. The menu is pretty simplistic with prices for entrees ranging from 18 to 30. While the cocktails were priced around 15, there is a happy hour special until 7 for beer ($5) and wine ($8). Service at the restaurant was great, and our food came our within a reasonable amount of time. My friends got beef burgers which they enjoyed and I got the brick chicken which comes with the side of a salad and macaroni and cheese. Overall the food was decent, and I would come back to this place again if I'm in a bind for a quick and easy reservation in the financial district."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this place gets busy, it's a smaller space and was half full when I arrived. It is on a quieter road and being connected with Le Germain hotel on Mercer it may not need locals to stop in (they would be missing out though). I'm always a fan to have a bite to eat here when I'm staying at the Le Germain in Toronto. I sat at the bar and was catered to by the bartender all night, she happily found options for me to dine on that were allium free and delicious!  I had the scallops plus a cheeseboard the most recent time I've been in, fantastic."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like Victor, I did not realize this was in a Hotel, but the food was tasty.  I was visiting Toronto, and do not have much to compare with in the area."}
{"text":"Meals are very tasty, my favourIte is the beef tartare. The price for one glass of wine or cocktail is a bit pricy. The service is very good, but you need patience for the meals, it takes a while."}
{"text":"Inside the Germain hotel. Small and elegant at the same time. Waiter was friendly and attentive. Menu is limited and portions on the small side but everything tasted great."}
{"text":"Went here for a wonderful Valentines Dinner, big surprise from my guy. 

The restaurant is located just inside the main hotel lobby doors off to the left. 

Really liked the place for it's simple, but super modern elegance. They had a special Valentines menu, but the items all contained chocolate (chocolate soup?) and it all seemed a little over the top, so we stuck with the traditional menu.

The special of the day on Saturdays is the Surf & Turf special, so we both went ahead with that and it did not disappoint. Steak was cooked a perfect medium rare as requested, and the lobster was tender. 

Menu is balanced and they had a good cocktail selection and large vine list. My daiquiri was divine.

Perfect spot for either a date or a business dinner/lunch."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentines day. They had a set menu of 4 courses for $75 per person. I thought this was a pretty decent deal for being an upscale restaurant.

The menu we had consisted of
Soups - lobster bisque and a leek soup. Both were good but not amazing
Salad - tuna with scallops and a beet salad. The tuna was really good. It was sushi style tuna and the scallops were seared to perfection. The beet salad was also good but the tuna was way better
Pomegranate sorbet to \"cleanse\" the palette
Dinner - my wife had the beef tenderloin and I had the black cod. The tenderloin was cooked to perfection and tasted delicious. All of the other flavours it came with matched very well.
Desert - Chocolate mousse cake and a passion fruit custard (think creme brule). Both delicious

We were served glasses complimentary sparking wine to begin the evening. The servers were very attentive and prompt and the atmosphere was great.

All in all a nice place to eat for a special dinner."}
{"text":"Lovely French restaurant. I've been here for both drinks and for dinner, and both experiences were great. The beef tartare was some of the best I've ever had. I also loved the pork chop; juicy and seared perfectly. Impeccable service as well - they accommodated my baby and found us a table that would suit her stroller being next to me. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came here on Friday evening. It was quiet and that was a flag. But since the reviews were good and it is branded as \"French\" food, we thought it can't be disappointing. We learned later it actually was.
We ordered the cold sea food platter. Everything was too salty, including the appetizer bread.
Service was also not as great. No one was there to get us seated until we asked the restaurant reception if we were at the right restaurant. Since there were just so few customers, there was not any attentive waiter except the one who finally showed up to seat us who then spent most of time in the kitchen.
We would give this a 3.5 rating."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with exceptionally attentive service.  We went for a hosted party with passed hors D'oeuvres (super yummy) and cocktails in the library bar area, then dinner in a semi-private space.  The scallop appetizer was sublime.  I had a roasted polenta dish for the main course, which was good, but not great.  Finished with a vanilla pavlova.  Wish I had remembered to take a picture before I ate it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the lobby of the hotel.

For a Tuesday night, it was packed by 6pm. The service is slow as the wait staff/kitchen were inundated with 80% of the patrons ordering at the same time. We were given some nice bread and Olive Oil in Salt and Balsamic Vinegar as we were waiting.

We originally were coming here for the Beer and Burger Special which they no longer do..

As we were perusing the menu, the Happy Hour Menu caught our eye..

Buck a Shuck Oysters - so we ordered 3 dozen 

We also ordered some dinner off the menu:

Beef Short Rib Poutine - the Short Rib was flavorful and intense and the Fries was cruchy with well seasoned gravy and cheese curds

Pork Chop - the chop is nicely seared and not over cooked, the brussels sprout is nicely crisp on a bed of celiac puree and chutney.

Come in at 5pm to take advantage of the Happy Hour tapas and drinks."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here and the staff was great. I thought the focus on local neighborhood cuisine was a very cool touch particularly if you're from out of town. 

The only complaint was the plate/cutlery combination.  Sounds stupid but if you set the fork on the edge of the plate it slides off then flips up tossing food or sauce all over you! I'm all for pretty tableware but not at the expense of practicality.  The waitress said it happens all the time! Hello!!!

So other than my ruined brand new shirt the place is great.  :-)"}
