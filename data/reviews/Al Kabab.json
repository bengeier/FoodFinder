{"text":"Food tastes very nice but I find the meat dishes to be too oily. The vegetarian dishes are superb."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. Skip the overly salted items of silver spoon and walk down to this place. When I was alone I would come here couple of times a week. Asad-front cashier is always helpful and informed me about fresh items and quite reasonable pricing just like a take out joint should be. A take out shouldn't cost as much as a dine in and most restaurants miss that part."}
{"text":"This place has good food. Much better than Silverspoon. However my friends and I have gotten catering done from them and the quantity of food has always been much much less than the number of people we get catering done for. If they increased their quantity I would give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"By far the best take out resturant in mississauga. Been there a couple of times absolutely love their biryani, their naans are really good, recently tried their lahori chargha have no words to explain how good it was. Affordable prices  I would recommend everyone to try their food. Nice clean and peaceful environment. Definitely going back soon to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I really am shocked that this place gets so much business. I have been here 3 times now and have received different results each time and as a result will never go back. I'm not one to write negative reviews for places but this place really stands out that I'm taking the time to write this to hopefully warn others in some way.  The first time was okay at best. Very slow service and the staff aren't particularly friendly either. The food was pretty good when we got it and, since it was for a gathering for friends and family at home, the food had very little left over. It was worth the low prices for sure. However, my stomach wasn't happy with me the next day but I figured it was just bad luck.   Second and third times are a different story. On our second time, once again, the service was terribly slow and not particularly friendly but the prices are good for fresh food so you put up with it, right? Except the problem is that it's not fresh at all. We got chicken karahi that we didn't realize had gone very bad until we got home. We opened up the sealed container and instantly the smell clearly indicated it was spoiled. I was pretty shocked but the other items we got seemed okay so we sort of shrugged it off a bit as a one time thing.   But it definitely was not a one time thing. Third time we went, because I'm clearly foolish for not learning from the last time, we got bhindi and kheema and it tasted fine, though the kheema seemed a bit off. There was some leftover so we packed it and left it in the fridge overnight to take for lunch the next day. Opened it the next day and instantly the smell clearly indicated it went bad. How can food from this place go bad so quickly? It may be cheap but it's a big waste of money. If you're a person who likes to spend their money rolling the dice with their food, try this place.   Its really a shame because I want to support local businesses, especially Pakistani, but please avoid this place. Clearly there's some health violations going on if their food is this inconsistent and bad. I'm really surprised too, they are usually quite busy. Do other people just have iron stomachs or am I just getting unlucky with the amount of spoiled food they have given me? Either way, I will be avoiding this place not just because of their low quality food, but also because of their poor service.  Updated my review to 2 star because their chicken biryani is consistently good and an amazing value."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. I've had a few things so far but my favourite has to be their tandoori chicken. On its own or in a roll. It's absolutely phenomenal. I plan on catering from them for an Eid party. LOVE!"}
{"text":"This place opened up new at the location where cafe-de-khan restaurant was. They are similar style as sliver spoon down in the same plaza.  I was there to grab breakfast as they had a deal on Halwa Puri over the weekends. I would say it was good. The puri was not to greasy and the halwa, chola and potatoes were good.  Over all it was a good experience.   FYI... this place is halal!"}
{"text":"Ordered charga. Which was pretty good. Decent portion for $17.  Had bihari kabab to go. Wasn't impressed, tasted spoiled after couple of hours in fridge. Threw it in garbage."}
{"text":"Good food, great service at the pick up counter. I tried the chicken biryani and reshmi kabab. Loved the reshmi kabab."}
{"text":"Al Kabab is a new take out place that seems to look promising so far. Take out places usually serve good biryani so I ordered chicken biryani and achari(pickled) chicken.  Biryani was a bit of a let down as it had less chicken and more bones and the achari chicken had less gravy with oil floating on top.  It's decent for the price therefore you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"They have really improved their quality. It is consistent. I would say go at 12 noon you would find all the things really good.  nehari, behari, chicken tika are good.  Daily specials are also good. Asad who I guess is the owner or person on main counter is a real helpful guy. He would take care of every one standing in line.  My wife always preferes it over silver spoon."}
{"text":"The food here is horrible/terrible . I don't give bad reviews unless deserved. Biryani was cold and dry, chicken was almost missing, my friend liked the food but only the Naan"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly great!  I believe tjey are Pakistani restaurant but they also carried Indian style.  Took the reviews with a grain of salt because other sites reviewed it at higher stars than yelpers.  Good thing I did!  Food:   We ordered chicken wings, a type beef curry, okra and chicken biryani.  The beef was amazing.  Quite tender, not overly spicy but very flavourful.  The biryani also wasn't too spicy but flavourful with very tender chicken.  The wings were also not overly spicy only complaint is I wish it had more char on the skin to crisp it a bit.  The wings were juicy though.  The naan needed a bit more ghee on it and just a tad more flavour.  The okra, I could've eaten 2 more bowls of.  Service:  They weren't very busy with the weather.  The service we received was amazing.  They were patient.  They even gave us samplers.  They made suggestions on what we would probably enjoy and what's popular.  They asked if it was our first time there in which we said yes.  The gentleman said, then you must try a dessert on the house.  \"Have it while you wait for the wings to cook.\"  He was very proud of it.  We didn't try it until we got home.  It was such a nice touch.  *the dessert was great!  I would pay for it next time.   We will be back at this place!"}
{"text":"Solid food,  great service.  Love this place!  Nihari, butter chicken,  bhindi all taste great. Spinach was unbelievable.   They have great specials Monday to Thursday too."}
{"text":"By far the best take out in Mississauga. We tried biryani, both spicy and mild,  great serving with taste. Paya and nihari with fresh baked naan are very good.  In BBQ chicken wings are OK but can be better. Fried fish just ok too much coating.  Halwa puri breakfast special is the best in GTA.   A good completion between silver spoon and al kabab  because now silver soon is improving too."}
