{"text":"Sandwiches are Italian authentic!! Very tasty and you get alot. Also very nice idea to have a mini size sandwich for when you just need a quick snack! Good service and clean place. I will recommend to others!!"}
{"text":"Awful, just awful! I ordered 2 steak sandwiches and it was terrible! I added mushrooms and rapini on the Sandwiches and the Rapini was like mush! Literally it was bitter not the way rapini should be and it was soo mushed up like spinach. The steak was sooo tough and chewy, and believe me this is not how a steak sandwich should taste. Seems like the cook really isn't very much of a cook at all. Also instead of putting some sort of steak sauce they put marinara. Who the heck puts marinara and steak together?  It absolutely changes the steak sandwich to something it shouldn't be. Plus it costs about $10 a sandwich, not cheap for chewy meat thrown together with marinara sauce and mushed up rapini! I will never go back to this place and if u choose to try it, go on ur own accord knowing it does not compare to a true Italian sandwich. I'd recommend trying McDonalds over this place. Seems like the owner had a great idea opening an Italian sandwich place in Brampton, but the quality heavily needs to improve."}
{"text":"Was craving a Veal Parm on a bun and had just recently heard about this place....Let me tell you the sandwich definitely hit the spot. It was a good size( ordered mine with mushrooms ) and was very tasty. Next time I will add cheese and the only negative was that the sandwich could have used a little more sauce. All in all , it gets an A+ for the food and service."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 veals for the family. Sandwiches were big (comparable to the \"other\" guys). Veal was tender with good breeding. Sauce was very tasty. Only small complaint would be that the hot sauce wasn't very hot. Need to kick it up!"}
{"text":"Say what you want about the suburbs, how they're big, impersonal, and over-run by chains... At one point I MIGHT have agreed with you but when I explore one of our greatest natural resources in the 905, that being MEGA Plazas, you start to realize that these plazas are in actuality neighbourhoods in and of themselves and not impersonal retail spaces (plus unlimited free parking?? You can keep your 416 Parallel parking and parking tickets!

I say neghbourhoods because while these plazas have their big anchor stores, more and more of the businesses that make up the character of these plazas are businesses run by local business owners and entrepreneurs like Ital Sandwiches!

They're a newer spot, since the plaza is super new and most places are still up for rent, but they've got a molto prime (primo) corner unit location that is bright, airy and very very Italian. The aesthetic and design in here is cute, modern and a little Italian Kitsch. They've got great artwork and vibrant Red marble/granite counter top and Green/White/Red subway tiles to show off their heritage.

But the real star here is the food, yes Italian Veal/Chicken/Steak SANG-wiches (said the Italian way) are present all over the 905 BUT I gotta say the freshness of the buns, the tenderness of the veal, the organized fashion by which they put on the toppings... all 5 star in my opinion! Take a look at my picture and you'll see how perfect their sandwich looks - drools!

In addition to the standards they also offer a long list of Catering options (pastas, salads, breads, etc) so this is a great spot to keep in mind should you need catering or large orders of food in the Brampton area for an event.

David the owner is the smiling face you'll see in the back personally adding his flare to every order... and if you like it extra spicy, ask him to kick it up a notch for you - the hot peppers are free!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Best little hole-in-the-wall sandwich shop. Mom and Pop owned and operated. I never in a million years would have found this place if it hadn't been for Yelp. The reviews were spot on...excellent handmade/homemade sandwiches with very generous portions. 

Only negative could be they have a tuna sandwich and veggie sandwich as the only offerings for vegetarians, (had one with me that day. Mostly delicious burgers, chicken and pork sandwiches.

Go to this place and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place, perfect size and the prettiest assembly of a veal sandwich I have ever witnessed, does the chef have ocd? But who am I to complain? 

Go here and enjoy."}
{"text":"New plazas are always exciting because of the potential for numerous new, interesting restaurants. I've been driving through this plaza every once in a while to see what's opening up next.

With the first restaurant in this plaza (Pho 123) getting mixed reviews, I was eager to try Ital Sandwiches, the second restaurant to open. The interior is very sleek and modern looking. They have a white theme which really brightens the place up. TVs can be found on the walls, and the space feels quite roomy.

They have a variety of Italian Sandwiches, as the restaurant name would suggest. My personal favourites are always the veal or eggplant parmesan. I opted for the veal on my first visit. Like it's competitors, additional toppings are chosen a la carte. I opted for provalone and mushrooms, which added about $2 to my meal. They have a jalepeno spread that they offer free of charge, so I went for that too, of course.

The sandwiches are large. At $10+, they will fill you up. The bread is fresh. Two veal cutlets were breaded and stacked between the buns, and covered in a tomato marinara sauce. The veal was tasty, not chewy at all, which is a plus.

I really enjoyed my first visit to this shop - the staff were friendly and the food was good.

Tip: If you're looking for a smaller portion, they serve a smaller version of their sandwiches called The Single, which I presume just means one cutlet instead of two."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch as we happened to be in the area at Visions beforehand. The restaurant is clean, bright and modern and they have a good number of tables. Pretty standard menu here: they have a selection of Italian sandwiches, pizza, and specials. They have sandwiches available in regular and small sizes and the buns on display to the right of the cashiers so you know what size is good for you. I ordered a large sandwich combo and selected a Steak sandwich, garden salad and came with a canned pop or water.

The orders came up relatively quick. A very good sandwich. Fresh soft kaiser, nice slices of steak and  a good amount of saut√©ed onions on top. The tomato sauce was pretty standard stuff and they didn't load up on too much. A good sized side salad that was just romaine lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber. They only have prepackaged Kraft balsamic vinaigrette, which was a bit disappointing. I asked if they had any other dressings but they only had Caesar. Others in our group had Veal Sandwich (very good also) with mushrooms and fries (had a few of these and they were pretty good). Overall this a good Italian sandwich shop and I'd recommend Ital if you're in the area."}
{"text":"As far a food, interior, service and comfort, this new location is definitely in the 5 star category. And its really simple. The food is good, you have options to eat a lot or a little, the place is bright and clean and its easy to find parking. That may be because the strip plaza its in is still about half full, but I'll take it for now and worry about crowds later.

For $4.95, you can get a sandwich that will certainly be large enough for the average person. The regular sized veal starts at $7.95 before you add toppings, but a veal with a couple of toppings and a drink will cast you about $12.00. However that regular size veal sandwich is good enough for 2. Add some olives and its a good amount of food.

The Veal Sandwich itself was perfect! Right amount of meat, sauce and toppings that all stays in the bun! I love veal sandwiches that have sauce oozing out and flopping over the edge of the bun but I'd also like to eat it complete before it breaks up into stew. Ital gets it right!

It seems like there's some family and other dedicated staffers who bring your sandwich to your table. I hope they are able to maintain the level of service and quality of food I experienced.

Good work!

PS  If I would have one suggestion its.....please get a real espresso machine instead of the pods. Just to fully validate your place as an authentic Italian sandwich place. I'm sure it will pay back many times over. The smell of fresh coffee and tomato sauce does it to me every time; causes me to buy more and stay longer."}
{"text":"This was a seriously good sandwich! It was fresh & hot & just the right size. They put a hot pepper spread on it (at your request) that's extremely delicious! I missed the boat by not adding Provolone Cheese. I'd definitely do this again but I'd add the cheese. Tip to owner--get better plastic knives & forks. I prefer to eat that way as it stays off your face! Great sandwich...I'll be back."}
