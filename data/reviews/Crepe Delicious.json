{"text":"They are serving raw mushrooms on a crepe and charge for 9.75. The crepe is well cooked on its own  but seriously how could you mess up a crepe especially if your main product is crepe?"}
{"text":"Bought a crepe for my daughter. Then decided I wanted to buy a couple of ice cream cones for my sister and I. There were 2 of them working. The one stirring the batter let us try one flavor then went back to stirring the crepe batter and ignored us.The lady making the crepes was rude when we asked to try another flavor. She said 3 max... which would mean 3 each person? Apparently not. I only got to try one and didn't like it but since we had 3 tries between the both of us, she wouldn't let us try anymore. The crepe was good but since the staff was rude, we won't be coming back. Maybe they would be busier if they improved their customer service."}
{"text":"Lots of problems at this site:   First, the staff is very rude and unfriendly. Their accent is so strong that they are almost unintelligible.   Second, they don't seem to have enough ingredients on site. They were out of whipped cream 30 minutes after opening. They applied Nutella very sparingly on a Crepe Nutella and then wanted $1.50 extra for the regular amount of filling.   Third, hygiene seems to be a problem there. I saw the service girl climb over the counter before they opened with the soles of her shoes on the countertop. She didn't clean it before opening.  As much as I like crepes, I'll rather avoid this place."}
{"text":"I have tried the Nutella & Banana Crepes  and then also the Mom Crepe which was Caramel, Banana and Coconut - both were great.   Big portion sizes so good for sharing and saving calories - will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of crepes to begin with mainly because it kind of resembled the traditional South Indian dish - a dosa. However a friend recommended me to try out crepes for the first time and since I was at the Eaton Center, I saw the sign for Crepe Delicious. I told myself \"Why not?\"  So I went over and decided to try out the Romeo and Juliette which I had and added the lemon with icing sugar. Yes its not healthy BUT it is one of those times when you have to satisfy your taste buds and suck it up. As soon as I took a bite out of it, I was in heaving. It was mouth watering and it just melted in my mouth. I must say for my first crepe ever this one was the best. I am sure that there are more but for now this one is the best in my list. Of course until another one surpasses it.  As for the crowd, and overall service, it was pretty expected. I.e. the crowd was decent but the lineup was moving kind of slow. There were 4 cashiers/servers to help out, but it would have been nice if the process had been sped up. I had to wait 20 minutes to get my order which I guess is normal for a place like this?  Overall if they speed things up, I would then give it a 5 star, but for now it sits at 4 stares."}
{"text":"Again today in our travels we thought we would give them one last try, there are at least 3 items on the sweet menu with strawberries, the first item on the menu, tutti-frutti, sounded delicious, not even a sorry, just \"we have no strawberries\".  Get your act together people!!  At least for the net person, as I won't be wasting my time to stop at your counter again!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and went for lunch twice...I don't know why but the crepe wasn't bad I guess, tasted standard. Ordered the Popeyes crepe both of the times and the filling was generous, cheese and veg and all. Service was a bit on the slow side especially with a lineup and sometimes the person preparing your order may not be as skilled and could break the crepe a little (like the younger lady who made my order the second time I went.... Where is the love and care lol"}
{"text":"WTH?  Found it rather strange the crepe was not freshly made. They gave a pre-made crepe then heated it up, no surprise the crepe was hard, dry and crisp. It was also much thicker than what it should be.  You will be sadly disappointed if you were expecting to cap off a meal with dessert.  The crepe was bad,  same with the toppings.   Had them put whipped cream (which was spray can), dulce de leche (caramel) from jar, strawberries were ok but it's a strawberry! how can you mess that up?! and the custard was from a mix. This place gives crepes a bad name.    Clearly no effort to make a quality product. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to Upper Canada mall, I'll always have a crepe here. Crepes with Nutella, strawberries and bananas are so good, serve with their delicious soft ice cream. I would give this place 5 out of 5 stars if they weren't so expensive. Although they're a little pricy but they're real big, one person can barely finish it."}
{"text":"Western breakfast crepe. Not a fan of raw onions. Wish they'd asked or warned. Also...here is another place that gives you the smallest, cheapest, warmest, styrofoam cup of water to punish you for not paying for a bottle of overpriced beverage instead."}
{"text":"Crepe Delicious has been in business at the Upper Canada Mall for five years. I somehow missed it, not being much of a mall rat or keen on mall rat food. Once in a while, when hunger gets the best of me, I make an exception.   Order your food at the counter from a wide selection of entree, dessert and breakfast crepes. I had the Vegedelicious with mushrooms, tomatoes, green onions, peppers, black olives, romaine lettuce and melted mozzarella cheese. The crepe was nicely airy with a crisp quality and filled with more romaine lettuce than anything else. Not bad, if and when you're craving a whole whack of lettuce and a pancake.  My dining companion,  The Big K, a very hearty eater, had the Honey Mustard Crepe with  just a few slices of chicken lost in an abundance of romaine.  The Big K is not a dainty eater and had to eat again a few hours later. Total cost for two crepes: just over $17, tax included."}
{"text":"I am probably spoiled by eating the European crepes, so I was expecting a lot more. Taste is okay but nothing more. It depends on the filling, the crepe itself is boring (which shouldn't be). They fold it nicely so it is easy to eat them. The crepe is very thin, too thin for my taste."}
{"text":"The woman was very nice and informative. I ordered a spinach peppers egg crepe and it was quite large and very fresh. The price was incredible and I couldn't even finish the meal."}
{"text":"Another stop in my valiant and foolhearty attempt to eat at every place in the Eaton centre food court. Came here for breakfast and got a ham, egg and cheese crepe. With coffee it was $9. Its not bad , batter is kinda meh and they give you mayo with the crepe ( I though the french only put mayo on fries )   I'm pretty ambivalent about crepes, especially on this side of the Atlantic but this is Still a better option than the Thai express across the way."}
{"text":"Ordered the corden bleu which included chicken breast, ham, lettuce, tomatoes and Caesar dressing in a warm, sweet crepe. Loved the blend of salty and sweet flavours!"}
{"text":"So.... You like crepes huh?! First off, I ordered a \"Garden Ham Crepe\" much to my surprise it actually did taste like the real deal (the actually crepe portion) unfortunately the inside contents of ham, lettuce, mayo and etc weren't as appealing :( I was hoping I'd have some warm ham and maybe my cheese would be a little melted but overall it tasted amazing until about half way then my mayo got the crepe part slightly soggy. I saw a couple get a few of the sweet crepes and those looked AMAZING. If I were to come back, I would definitely say choose a sweet option verses a savory."}
{"text":"Very overpriced, our crepe was freshly made to order unlike the other Yelpers reported but jesus would ya mind stuffing it with more strawberries and custard?!? Crepe was okay, nothing spectacular. I expeted spectacular for $9.00-10.00 Something I can easily make at home for pennies.  I hear excellent reviews for Muncheez Creperie and the photos for that place don't lie! Crepes are stuffed!"}
{"text":"*Smoothie only review*  After my disappointing first try of their smoothie, the owner was nice enough to invite me to come back to try it again on the house.  I can certainly appreciate this kind of customer service.  I ordered the Mango Tango, which is a mix of mango and bananas.  This time they added yogurt, so it was more of a smoothie than the first watered down version that I got.  It was good, not too sweet and tasted fresh.  The price tag is still pretty hefty at $6.75 for a large (which may be more of a medium at some other places) and $5.75 for a small.  I'll still have to come back and try the crepes."}
{"text":"This place is on the second  floor, outside the main food court, so probably easy to miss. The crepes are made fresh in front of you and you get to pick what goes inside so you get to pick if you want dessert or meal. And you can substitute items at will.  Most of the crepes are $7-9, so may be a dollar or two more than those cardboard burgers, but much healthier. They have a special non-stick crepe maker, so the crepes are not greasy at all. And they taste great!  The guy at the counter was also very friendly, but we were there midday on a weekday, so it was pretty empty. I am guessing the amount of small talk the staff makes drops around Sunday brunch time.  Excellent place to take your kids! The making process is very fast (everything is already cut, so after we ordered and paid we had to wait about 90 seconds to get the order).  Advice: The crepes come nicely folded in a little triangular container. Don't try to be pretentious (like I) and try to use a fork and a knife."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I've been to this crepe place a few times and on all occasions I've had satisfactory experiences. I never have to wait long to place my order or for my food to be prepared and the staff members are always very bubbly and friendly during each visit.  I ordered the \"tutti fruitti\" crepe which consisted of nutella, fresh bananas, & strawberries. Overall, I thought it was a pretty good crepe. There wasn't anything that distinguished them from the other crepe eateries in Toronto. The crepe itself was a decent size and flavor. I thought their menu prices were a little pricey though but I guess that is just the standard for \"gourmet\" fast food restaurants these days.   In summary: Great service, efficient staff, and good crepes."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here twice, the food was ok, the crepes and gelato though are awesome!"}
{"text":"All I can say is YUM. This is one of those places that you have to try when your out shopping at Sherway Gardens. I loved my Nutella & Banana crepe and it was made just right without drowning too much of either the nutella or banana.   They also serve some sandwiches, gelato, drinks etc apart from the crepe.   Service was really prompt and the lady who made it was really nice as well.  Whenever am at Sherway I will definitely come by and have my dessert fix here."}
{"text":"They have a special going on which includes a drink, a black & white crepe (nutella and banana crepe) and any savoury crepe for around $15. The nutella and banana crepe is a classic combo and pretty difficult to mess up. For the savoury crepe, I chose the Cordon Bleu which included tomatoes, lettuce, ham and chicken breast with Caesar salad dressing inside the whole wheat crepe. You can opt for a \"normal\", whole wheat, or spinach batter. When I visited though, they were out of the spinach batter and running low on the whole wheat one, so my guess is that most people go for the regular batter. The whole wheat crepe was a little thicker and tougher, but still as delicious. Wonderful service and very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Very great for quick snack, very delicious!  The people working there were nice and added some extra cheese for us. The crepes were little pricey, but noticed crepe is generally expensive everywhere. Wish they could put more fillings into it. Compared to an actual sit down crepe store ,we think this is better in a shopping mall. Enjoyed our visit and will come back again."}
{"text":"The S'more Gelato looks amazing!  I saw it as I walked by I haven't tried it yet, but that's next on my list from this delicious place!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times, and have always been a fan of their gelato and crepes! But l must say, I have experienced one of my worst visits from this place. I got a gelato from them and after eating a few spoons of it, I found a piece of hair in it. Obviously I'm not too happy about that. I brought it back and showed them, they automatically got me a new one. I did not want to make a big deal out of it but within seconds of receiving my new gelato, I found another piece of hair in it. Okay. Now that is just gross! Brought it back to them again, not looking happy at all. Told and showed them that there is ANOTHER!! piece of hair in my gelato. They dared to ask if I wanted to try another one. Um. No! I don't even want anything at all from them after that. In the end they just ended up giving me a full refund on my gelato."}
{"text":"Was surprised to see some of the reviews. The price might be a bit high, but the crepe was amazing. Freshly made and very tasty. I had the tuna one and it made me really happy"}
{"text":"What do you do when you are walking through the mall and you suddenly get a craving for gelato? Easy, you stop at Crepe Delicious and you indulge in some gelato. I stopped here on Sunday evening to cure my sweet tooth. This place offers a ton of different ice cream, gelato, and of course crepe options to fill you up while shopping. I ended up getting a scoop of the mint chocolate chip and a scoop of the the birthday cake (for the record, it was not my birthday). Even though I realized after my first bite that I totally was not nearly as hungry as I thought I was, I did fight through the pain and finish my tasty gelato. Overall, this place is awesome and a great shop to have in a mall, will be coming back!"}
{"text":"A solid 3 for me. Bought a groupon $15 credit for $7.50 and ordered two crepes for me and the fiancee.   Had the chicken teriyaki crepe while she had the veggie with spinach and olives. The taste is ok but the siZe is somewhat small.  Total came to $17.90 after taxes so we had to pay $2.90 extra.   Will be back if I only have a groupon as I would not be willing to pay $18 for two small crepes"}
{"text":"TI ordered a chicken teriyaki crepe from them today...the crepe was good.however it's contents were cold. One would think that they would have heated up the chicken....or even allowed the cheese to melt all over and make it nice and gooey. But they didn't! Contents were as cold as if they just took them out of the fridge...  Lucky me I overheard what they thought I ordered but I quickly corrected that mistake. All in all I will not be returning to this location because the contents of a crepe in my opinion should be warm...not cold."}
{"text":"I came into the Urban Eatery and was really not feeling any of the restaurants. Then I settled on this crepe place and my only regret is not noticing the check in offer before my order haha!  Staff: I wasn't sure which end was the beginning. There were about 6 people waiting but they were just waiting for their food and so the gentleman behind the counter asked to serve me which I appreciated since I'm sure I looked lost. They took my order, nothing special.  Ambience: They had a nice clean area that was well lit. I like being able to watch them cook my food and it is also reassures me that it was made in a clean environment.   Food: It was very good. I had ordered a Chicken Caesar Crepe and the chicken was nice. There was plenty of filling with lots of dressing which I appreciated. My only criticism is I think the crepe was a little soggy due to the wet filling (e.g. tomatoes, dressing, etc.).  I'll definitely try it again in the future!"}
{"text":"Just had their $6 special, Choco-Dream. They use watered down chocolate syrup instead of nutella... and the result is a soggy crepe soaked in syrup that didn't taste anything like chocolate"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki crepe without cheese. First of all, when I think chicken teriyaki I don't think romaine lettuce and cheese. Also I think they mixed up the sauce and gave me the chicken caesar sauce because my sauce was really creamy and didn't look or taste like teriyaki sauce. I wasn't happy with my dish because the chicken wasn't even hot. It wasn't even warm! It was cold. It wasn't very appetizing.   If I do order from here again I will just get a dessert crepe or fruit crepe which is meant to be eaten cold. Wasn't happy with this dish."}
{"text":"Why go looking when I had a pearl at muncheez?   Greeted??? I'm not sure if we're both morons, she stared at me with a blank look, waiting, waiting, \"are you ready to order\" discontent employee or cultural difference? most places just say \"hi what can I get you\"  I'm to lazy to tell her \"yo ready to take my order?\"  I scored them a HIGH 2(good)because  1, the son(?) tossed the first crepe out , I guess he screwed up? 2, the mom(?) said something to him and he put more strawberries(coincidence?)  Nice to see, but damage was done and only got worse.   To the negative feedbacks :  - it was freshly made - They used Nutella the \"choco dream\" on the menu even states chocolate sauce the others say Nutella...  My negativity though The wraping paper not as clever as the best store in town. So you have difficulty eating Despite the mom(?) scorning him and getting an extra scoop of strawberries all I could taste were the bananas. It all drooped to the bottom of the crepe.. so it was crepe, crepe, crepe and at the bottom a blob of chocolate, strawberries and bananas.  It was ok...  won't repeat.  The negative reviews were wrong in their descriptions, but they were right in the star rating."}
{"text":"I was in the Urban Eatery early in the morning looking for something to eat. My options were McDonald's, Subway, A&W and Crepe Delicious. The others sounded really boring and uninteresting so I decided to give Crepe Delicious a go even though it was the most expensive of the bunch.  I ended up getting a small coffee along with the Good Morning Canada crepe - 2 eggs with cheese. Final price was just under $9, which isn't awful but kinda expensive for what you get. The young man who took my order and made my crepe was friendly and attentive, although he did go a little heavy on the salt and pepper on my crepe.  The coffee was pretty standard, but did it's job and woke me up. The crepe itself was pretty good. I thought it was tasty and filling without feeling overly greasy and fatty like you'd find in standard breakfast sandwich fare at other fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"This is such a sad excuse for a crêperie. First of all, I think they use the same batter for both sweet and savoury crepes which makes no sense. Not that it mattered too much I guess since their crepe was completely flavourless. There were no traditional options like ham and eggs and cheese so I got the chicken pesto. To my dismay, they literally stuffed all of the ingredients into a pile and folded the crepe in half. They then just served it to me like that. Barely put enough sauce to cover the pile of lettuce and tomatoes I received. I was basically eating a cold salad that wasn't even tossed wrapped in a half cooked flavorless crepe. this chain is definitely owned by north americans. Clearly these people are just trying to make a huge by selling dishes with mediocre ingredients and charging exorbitant prices. I paid almost $12 for a really shitty salad."}
{"text":"Really good crepes.   Entrée crepes are very good.   Dessert crepes are to die for!   Lots of choices, great service, made to order so you know that it's fresh!   Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Must try the Nutella crepe with banana and strawberries.... Amazing!!!!! My little one always wants to get one every time we pass... As its so close to toys r us!"}
{"text":"i would give this location 3.5  I have been to crepe delicious on several occasions and in several different locations.  Always meets my expectations.  i feel like its an healthy alternative to other fast food joints around.  Sometimes i think they could put more ingredients but once the complete crepe is finished its always packed and about to explode.  ingredients seem to always be fresh which is good.    only downside is the wait but hey... its fresh."}
{"text":"Great gelato, but pricey. If you use the Yelp offer, you can get a pretty good deal on the crepes themselves."}
{"text":"Mmmmm crepes at Eaton Centre! That, or froyo. I love both.  I came here during a busy weekday lunch.. day. And this was the place with the least lineups (right after we ordered ours, the lineup started).  The crepes were nothing amazing... We ordered a Garden Ham and Chicken Teriyaki. The chicken was extremely dry and it didn't taste too good.... I loved the ham though. I had honey mustard (I think!) with the Garden Ham, that was great.  But they gave very little dressing on the crepes... There was hardly any honey mustard or teriyaki sauce.  That time when we were there, the guy making the crepes was new and was extremely slow. It was funny to watch, luckily I wasn't in a hurry.  I checked in on Yelp, and there's a complimentary coffee if you order crepes here. So I approach the manager asking him this. He actually didn't know about it, but he happily gave us our coffee (in fact, he gave us lattes!)  The manager is very nice here, he was very friendly. Lots of smiles, lots of jokes. That's why it's a 4 star to me!"}
