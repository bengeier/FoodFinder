{"text":"This was a great place to enjoy a quiet, delicious,  Saturday night dinner in downtown Montreal. The pasta dishes we had were excellent,  and the service was very personal and special.  We were thrilled that we did not feel rushed at all,  and were truly able to enjoy the evening.  We would definitely go back here if we come to Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Last week my husband and I and our good friends were visiting Montreal for the first time. On our first evening, we walked to La Capannina from our nearby hotel. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. In fact, we enjoyed the experience so much, we decided to go again our last night in Canada. Claude was a gracious host, the food was terrific, and the atmosphere was friendly and welcoming. The scaloppine di vitello castellana and the linguine maranello are excellent. Thank you, Claude for a lovely evening."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night and it was fairly quiet but the pasta was very tasty. I had fettuccine in a rose sauce with prosciutto and mushrooms. My wife had gnocchi. Service was very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Tasty Italian food, small menu but has the essential all prepared nicely.  Owners were very welcoming and the service was good.  I'm just sad they did not have osso bucco the evening I went..."}
{"text":"Food and place is nice. Mariano dessert really good. The owner is not nice at all, very rude. Waiter was amazing serving the whole restaurant without help and eith no delays in the orders."}
{"text":"I decided to go for the fish of the day.  It was a filet of sole with a lemon sauce.  It came with some roasted potatoes and vegetables.  They have an upscale menu with prices to match, but still have some Italian staples which are more somewhat more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner. Everything we ate was delicious including the stracciatela soup, the Italian salad, the sculpi (arancini), the scaloppini al limone, the lasagna, and the spaghetti carbonara. Add to this the outstanding service and it was a perfect choice for dinner."}
{"text":"Tasty food. Good service. Nice atmosphere. Even during F1 weekend they shine. A family owned and operated restaurant that serves you like family. Although they arent flashy and tend to fly under the radar, for the location you cant do better."}
{"text":"Pressing forward on my goal to try as many new restaurants in the city as possible, hubby and I came here for dinner a couple Saturday nights ago.

Walking in, I was immediately nervous because of how empty the place was (you know how in Montreal the good places are always busy? Well this one was super quiet at 7:30 on a Saturday so...)

Anyways, trusting in the amazing Yelp reviews, we sat down and ordered the prosciutto fettuccine with mushrooms and the seafood pasta. The restaurant was great in accommodating our requests to change the sauce of each dish so that the fettuccine was made with alfredo instead of a rosè sauce and the seafood pasta with tomato instead of an alfredo sauce. We also ordered a bottle of wine to go with the meal.

Very quickly, we got our wine which came to our table in the hands of the very nice owner (Claude, I believe). He was very friendly and chatted with us about the history of the bottle we ordered as well as about his reviews on Yelp when we told him that that was how we discovered his place.

After 15 minutes or so the food came out, and delicious is an understatement for how good my dish at least was! My fettuccine was out of this world delicious and hubby seafood pasta was good (but apparently not amazing). The portions were perfect and the service during dinner was great. Overall, we spent about $100 (w/tax and tip) for a bottle of wine and two mains.

Stop by the next time you have a hankering for pasta - I don't think you'll regret it ;)"}
{"text":"The service and food were excellent! I had the veal scallopini and he had the cannelloni. We started with the calamari was delicious. We brought our 3.5 year old daughter, and the owner made a fuss and made her smile the whole night. It was a lovely experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and terrific experience.  A perfect small Italian restaurant feel.  The host made us feel like family and they accommodated special requests."}
{"text":"Great choice for Italian! I came with my family over the holidays and we all enjoyed our pasta dishes. I opted for a three course meal because of how affordable it was ($24 I believe). Salad was great, and I loved the simple and not too sweet Gateau Mariano. Servings were quite large, but we all must have been hungry because we mostly cleaned our plates! The server did a great job taking care of the whole restaurant including a very large group that came in soon after us. The one disappointment was that they were out of meatballs - the server explained that it was because they were closing for a while over the holiday and didn't restock."}
{"text":"Not a good restaurant for kids!!!

In terms of the dishes we ordered, they were fine.  The sauce used for the tortellini I ordered was good.  The veal my wife ordered didn't have enough flavor in our opinion.  All in all, the quality of the food was good but I wouldn't say it is the best italian food we've ever eaten.

The waitress was very courteous to us and was considerate of the fact that we had a 2-yr old toddler accompanying us.  It should also be noted that we mentioned we had a toddler accompanying us when we made our reservation.

Our main issue with our experience is how the Owner/chef of the restaurant approached our table after he heard our toddler making some noise.  At first, we thought he was joking around when he told my son he better behave.  However, he then proceeded to say that we need to do a better job of making him behave.  And he said this restaurant is for adults but he was making an exception for us provided our son was on his best behavior.  He also mentioned he had 5 children and keeps them all in line so as to imply we may not be doing the best job with our toddler.  We were very offended and asked for the bill right away.  He also continued to say he doesn't want to lose his other customers because of our son's disruption.  I still tipped the waitress since this situation was not her fault and she even apologized on his behalf.  But nevertheless, we were very embarrassed that the owner confronted us in front of other customers and my family and I couldn't wait to get out of there.

Anyways, long story short, I would not recommend bringing any kids with you to this establishment and I can say my family has never been spoken to in this way from a restaurant owner or any other individual.   

I don't plan to ever return this restaurant and would ask that this restaurant be noted as \"not good for kids\"."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch here. The special of the day, chicken cacciatore, was delicious. An extra few bucks provided a salad (which was tasty) and a great desert. Also the coffee is fantastic, the doppio was perfect.

Great service as well. I'm happy to have lucked out finding this place."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Italian food! Went here with my husband & two teenage boys on a Monday night while on vacation in Montreal. Growing up in an Italian household, I have a hard time going out for Italian because a lot of places just don't get it right, but this place definitely does. Best homemade gnocchi I've had at a restaurant. And the rose sauce was so yummy. We ordered the appetizer meatballs and the marinara sauce was perfect. My kids got the lasagne & a bolognese pasta and ate it up. Portions were nice too. Not too much. There was nothing left on our plates! Our meal for 4 was about $170 with desserts, and a few drinks, so not cheap but well worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. We came to them in a pinch with a large group. They accommodated us in our own room. The service was attentive. The decor is a little lacking but the food was really good. Drinks flowed steadily and we had a good time. 

Thank you."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited 3 times during our stay in Montreal. We went the first time and fell in love with the food! We adore Italian (it's pretty much all we eat) and can say that this place has bumped our former favourite. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is high class yet relaxed and the staff is extremely friendly. It's now our go to place when we are in the city!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service was good. Waitress has been at the restaurant for 10 years and gave great recommendations for all members of our party. I had  the Piccata Timone veal dish with mushrooms that was out of the world. Would recommend the Scia wine with it."}
{"text":"La Capannina was a small, intimate, and cute yet classy restaurant. It was the first restaurant my fiancé and I went to on our vacation to Montreal. We both got the gnocchi rosé which might have been the best gnocchi I've ever eaten. It was very soft and smooth and the sauce was a sweet vodka cream which tied it together nicely. Our waitress was very nice and catered to us amazingly despite us not speaking any French. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went two nights in a row. Claude is such a delight. My coworker and I had two very long days of work and this place was highly recommended by another coworker and it's obvious why. The tortellini was delicious and the flourless chocolate cake was probably the best I've had, not too rich, just perfectly chocolatey. The second night I had the veal cannelloni which was great as well! Must end your meal with some cappuccino. Be sure to check out this place if your looking for some delicious Italian and exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Italian in Montreal - a must. La Capannina in Montreal - a must. The service...the food...the ambiance = superb. Came here over the Grand Prix weekend...ordered the Caesar salad to start (the dressing is phenomenal), the escargot (some of the best in Montreal), and has a pasta dish that left my mouth watering. I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I was skeptical due to the low sample size of reviews, but ended up having a solid meal. 

The calamari and meatballs were both very tasty apps, and the seafood spaghetti was a perfect combination of spicy, fishy and filling. 

My only criticisms were slow-ish service (though to be fair, it was early for dinner) and unexceptional wine. The prices were fair and the restaurant didn't try to over-do anything. Definitely worth checking out for a casual Italian dinner."}
{"text":"Wow, incredible food and simple style. The gnocchi were soft and had full delicious potato flavor, the veal was tender... The carbonara was absolutely delightful. 

The service is slower than usual, but go with an expectation. You can tell it's a family run place, so take your time and enjoy! There is a lot of passion in that dish so don't rush it."}
{"text":"Wonderful food: reminds you how fresh, simple food can be so satisfying. I was told  that if there was something that I wanted that was not on the menu, just ask and they would make it.  The staff is attentive and kind, you will feel like an old friend, even on your first visit."}
{"text":"On our last trip to Montreal, my husbsnd was looking for a good Italian place and with so many positive yelp reviews, we checked it out. We were a party of 7 - 4 adults and 3 kids and we were sat in the back room, which was perfect for us. There was another family there but beyond that, we had the room to ourselves. Our waitress told us she was new and her inexperience showed. She was pleasant but lacked knowledge of the menu or general serving protocol. The menu is limited but solid. The pasta dishes were good. The seafood was ok. The gentleman who seemed to be in charge was fantastic. He seemed to know how to run the floor. My review would have been stronger and glowing if the server was better. It has been over a month since we were there so perhaps this has gotten better. I'm all about spending good money for good meal and exceptional service, but this time, we got 2 out of 3."}
{"text":"We decided to celebrate my beau's 30th with a trip to Montreal. We were really craving some nice Italian food so we decided to go here for his birthday dinner on Friday. It was favourable on our end as it literally was a 2-minute walk from our hotel. Upon our arrival, our server greeted us and told us to pick a seat, as there were a few vacant two-person tables.

The restaurant overall is quiet, intimate and has a nice romantic ambiance to it.

Our server was fantastic, friendly, laughed a lot and made great wine and meal suggestions. We had 2 meatballs to start which was a complimentary treat by Air Transat that was doing a sponsorship type program with the restaurant. They were delicious, perfectly seasoned and cooked.

We ordered a bottle of Syrah and the wine was smooth and went well with our choice of foods.

My partner got the Veal Parmigiana and instead of getting it with the potatoes and vegetables, we asked to substitute with the fettuccine alfredo - which was no issue for them. I got the gnocchi. I secretly wish that I got that meal because it was DELICIOUS. Everything tasted fresh and homemade and so did the gnocchi but I did find it a tad under cooked and mushy. I wish they would have pan fried it longer or something to make it more crispy.

We overall enjoyed our experience and loved our dinner!"}
