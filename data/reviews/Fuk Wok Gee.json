{"text":"Firstly, my Japanese name is Xu Wok Gee, so I was very offended by this restaurant's name. 

The only hot pot in this restaurant is the one the chef must have been smoking in the back. The pickled cabbage was too sour, and the vermicelli undercooked. 

The portions were also so big that we had to pack the food as hard as he packed heat. All in all, I, Daniel Wok Gee Xu, do feel like I was Fuked. And I will be coming back for more ;^DDDDDDDDD"}
{"text":"This was my second time trying Hot Pot, but I'm glad we decided to try out this little gem at First Markham Place.

We were seated close to the door on a cold night, however the restaurant temperature was just to our liking. Not knowing what to order, we asked for one fish dish, one beef dish & one chicken dish + soup. Our waiter was friendly, smiling and happy to bring us some random dishes based off of our requests.

For the three of us eating, we started with the Seafood Fried Rice, which paired perfectly with the Shredded Potatoes with Hot Sauce. Both dishes were delicious, had plenty of flavor, and the Potatoes had just a bit of kick to start the night off well.

Next came the Crab Meat Soup, which typically serves 4, but was devoured by the three of us. 

The waiter then brought the Fish Fillet Hot Pot (picture attached). This dish was truly the centerpiece of the meal, bringing spice and sweat to those that dare try it. It was served with hot peppers, hot pepper seeds & hot sauce littered into the juice, so much so that it brings a tear to my eye just thinking out it. However, this spicy sauce, combined with the delicate fish fillets, created a symphony of flavors. A must try for those that can handle the seasoning.

Not to be out-done, we were also served the Beef Tenderloin & Three-Cup Chicken to help distinguish the flames of the Fish. 

All dishes had generous serving sizes, and I'm ashamed to say we sadly couldn't finish it all.

In all, we had a great experience at Fuk Wok Gee, and this has re-kindled my love of Hot Pot cuisine."}
{"text":"We wanted to eat at another restaurant but there were so many people waiting in line because of Mother's day dinner so we decided to try this place instead. When we walked in, we saw all the tables have this big clay pot of fish soup, it looked so spicy!!! I don't think we can handle it so we ordered other things. Sweet corn soup with crab meat - it was a very clear soup but you can really taste the corn and crab meat, not out of a can. Shanghai fried noodle, BBQ chicken knees, dumplings, beef patty ...

The best of all that I ate tonight was the fried pumpkin with salted egg yolk ????. It was the first and most delicious dessert I have tried at the moment. I felt in love with it. Crispy on the outside with soft pumpkin meat inside. Toss with salted egg yolk and sugar on top. I couldn't stop eating it. I know it is unhealthy with the egg yolk but it was too good especially when it was still hot! I must come back again for it in the future."}
{"text":"First off - if you are looking for standard Chinese hot pot or AYCE-style hot pot, do NOT come here. This is a differently style of hot-pot cuisine.

That being said, the style of hot-pot here is a humongous stone pot with a choice of different types of fish. The menu choices were mainly Northern/Western Chinese dishes, with a few other regional dishes tossed in. We ended up getting the Szechuan broth with catfish - the fish they offer there is priced by the pound (the catfish is $10 per pound - they have other types). There's probably a reason why it isn't AYCE - the size of the bowl and what you get is humongous, it will fill you up no problem if you don't have a large group.

The quality of the food is excellent, considering the price that it can add up to - the total meal for 2 ended up being $63, but that was only because we had 7 side sides (each side dish is $1.99 extra, not included with the hotpot). Did have to wait a little bit for the food to come, but that was because they prepare it all fresh and not just frozen food on a plate.

Service was great and friendly, though they only speak Mandarin (I'm Cantonese). The restaurant was clean and occupancy was OK. Definitely a different style of hot pot, but not an unpleasant one.

Overall: Great place to bring the family in the winter, especially if you want the spicy broth to really keep you warm. Not a value-pick though - if you're looking for cheap standard hot pot, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"In 10 days I came here 3 times! I am from Beijing and I love myself some spicy northern china food. 

First day I ordered wu shan kao yu (roasted fish?excuse my translations because I didn't pay attention to their English names when I was ordering. ), la zi ji (spicy fried chicken) and cold appetizer tu dou si (shredded potato) 
It was a very good meal. Fish was fresh and nicely grilled/ roasted before getting soaked in the spicy hot pot. Fried chicken was delicious. Could have had more chicken pieces tho... And potato dish was very good. 

2nd time I tried their stone pot fish. I ordered nian yu (not sure of the fish breed in English but it's a type without scale and with less bones) it was not that good. So I suggest you get the kao yu rather than stone pot if you ever go. I also ate their lamb kabobs which was delicious! 

Third time was pretty much the same order as the first time but this time we sat in a corner booth... DO NOT SIT THERE if you ordered something with fire cuz the ventilation blows the smoke right into your eyes and the spicyness burns ;__;  the Szechuan fried chicken had more chicken bone than chicken pieces this time which was quite a let down and kao yu was not as good as the first time I guess they are just inconsistent with their cooks... 

I recommend their lamb kabobs! I'm pretty sure that shouldn't be inconsistent. Also since it's more of a northern Chinese cuisine I recommend ordering plain rice with their dishes because it tends to be salty and spicy. 

In conclusion they are not really a hotpot place more like hotpot fish place with decent northern Chinese style cuisine. I give it a 4/5 since I feel like I will be going there again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Fuk Wok Gee is another Northern Chinese Restaurant that opened recently in First Markham Place.

It is not a hot pot restaurant but it does specialized in stone pot fish, roasted fish, lamb spine soup that are serves in hot pot format.

The usual Northern Chinese menu as we trying to decide on what to order as nothing really jumped out as unique and interesting.

We ended up sharing:

???($9.99) Fried Shrimp
???($6.99) Pickled Cabbage with Vermicelli Noodles
?????($6.99) Glass Noodles with Mixed Veggies

All the dishes were A-OK! The portion though was huge and ended up we had to packed half of them to go.

I am eyeing that spicy stone pot fish under the Chef's recommendation, extra spicy please!"}
{"text":"We came to FMP for lunch and could not resist trying out this new restaurant.  Fuk Wok Gee takes over the location of Mori Sushi/Est West.  There is no change in interior decor except the sushi counter is gone.  

The storefront says it is a hot pot restaurant, but the menu lists a lot of regular dinner dishes, noodles, stir fried rices and dumplings.  It offers a mix of Northern Chinese, Shanghainese and Cantonese dinner dishes.  Call it Chinese fusion, maybe?

The waiter was eager to serve, friendly and quick.  He recommended a Yeung Chow stir fried rice and a spicy beef soup noodle, and we gladly complied.  Both dishes were bold in flavour, and frankly, they tasted the way they were supposed to taste like.  The Yeung Chow stir fried rice had lots of fresh shrimps, the color was good and the portion was great.  The soup of the noodle was rich, the noodle was al dente and the portion was decent.  On the other hand, it stood out to us that the pork bites in the Yeung Chow stir fried rice was from luncheon meat.  The traditional way is to use BBQ pork instead.   The soup noodle did not have braised beef chunks but had beef slices.  My BF said this was the way the Shanghai street eat was like.

So Fuk Wok Gee skips a cooking step or two, as well as uses more convenient meat options.  However, its spicy beef soup noodle is less expensive than the one sold in the FMP food court.  The stir fried rice was adequate and presentable.  We were generally happy with this lunch experience."}
