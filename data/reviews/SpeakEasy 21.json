{"text":"Summerlicious Lunch: I went along with two other friends because the menu looked so good, but unfortunately all three of us were very disappointed.

Hummus: friend had it and he said it was just like any other hummus spread and nothing special to it
Kale & Arugula: this was the highlight of my lunch, a bit salty was the mix was still nice. I liked the sweetness of pear and raisin with the salad

Pierogies: friend had it and was diappointed...
Pulled Pork Tacos: I enjoyed those however it was appertizer portion, wish it had 3 tacos instead of 2
BBQ Chicken Mac & Cheese: friend had it. It was lack of chicken (supposely shredded chicken but we still didn't find much chicken, and didn't have enough cheese in it. Overall really bland.

Banana Cream 'Pie': it looked like mashed banana with crushed cracker bits, but I couldn't even taste the banana in it
Chocolate Ganache: the ganache was way too hard and not creamy at all. I only ate the vanilla icecream on the top."}
{"text":"I'd give 0 stars if I could. Food was mediocre at best and the service was just terrible. Half way through our dinner our server disappeared  and we spent 30 mins trying to find a waitress to grab our bill since they were too busy flirting with the DJ or hoe-ing themselves out to men at tables."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night, and it was fairly busy - a lot of suits, which wasn't surprising given the location. 

The service was great (our waitress was very friendly)... and I think that's where the positives end. There was no one at the front desk when we arrived, so we had to go search for someone to acknowledge our existence. The music was a little too loud (I couldn't hear the person across the table from me), the drinks were mediocre (you could get a much, much better drink at BarChef for the same price as their cocktails), and the food was nothing to write home about. I would not go again - I wouldn't have paid half of what I actually paid for the quality of the food & drink."}
{"text":"I was here for the winterlicious menu. The taste of the soup was okay but not warm enough.  We waited a bit long for the main courses.  I ordered the mac and cheese it was better then I expected. But I gave a two stars rating was because my friends food were not warm when they served to us. The overall service and environment was not bad.  We went on a Monday night so it's quiet and we could chat."}
{"text":"Very good location. Service is okay. Menu is overpriced except for $4 beers on Fridays. We wanted to order something off the menu but they had ran out. 

Okay place but nothing to phone home for."}
{"text":"Horrible food and way way overpriced. Who the hell screws up a Pierogi?  Ordered four different plates and honestly none of them were good. Staff on was OK,  but not responsive to comments of bad food. Never will return."}
{"text":"My 1 star review mostly comes from the lack of service the servers actually give. It took HALF AN HOUR to flag down a server to come and give us our bill. We called them several times with them looking at our table and then failing to ever come. The servers were either busy flirting with the DJ or other patrons. They need to be re-schooled as they are in the service industry, they should be putting the patrons first, not their social life. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. 

Also the food is over priced for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I was super excited when this was about to open, but it didn't get the best reviews so I put it off. My friend and I wanted to celebrate our birthdays by going out for lunch and we saw that they were offering their Winterlicious menu a week early. We figured, why not? 

My friend ordered the pork belly skewers, sweet potato mac and cheese and the brownie dessert. I ordered the cauliflower soup, honey garlic ribs and also the brownie. 

The pork belly was an enormous portion for an appetizer. Three huge pieces of meat which was awkward to eat. She gave me some of hers and I found it very rich, but flavourful. The spice in the soup was so overpowering (and I love me some strong flavour) and it almost had a vinegary taste. No bueno. 

The ribs on the other hand were awesome! Fall off the bone delicious. The coleslaw left a bit to be desired. The granny smith apple in it barely saved it. It was quite bland. My friend seemed to really enjoy her mac and cheese and took half of it home. 

The brownie dessert came in a small mason jar with chocolate mousse, whipped cream, brownie pieces and peanuts. It was really yummy, but it would have been a 10 if they had warmed up the brownie pieces first. 

Service was good, but there was barely anyone in the place. I'm guessing they make the bulk of their money on the after work drink crowd. 

Atmosphere is ok. Nothing special compared to other downtown restaurants. High tables and stools mostly, so try to get a table with a bench seat against the wall."}
{"text":"Based on the name I was expecting something completely different! I'm sorry but the term \"speakeasy\" should NEVER be associated with a lace like this!   my Hendrick's was served with  LIME! Cucumber was not even offered!"}
{"text":"Not a real speakeasy except maybe with the snazzy ads that piqued my interest. The vibe was more of a sports bar with servers in short skirts and UFC, baseball etc. playing on multiple TV screens. 

Overpriced for drinks and food. The guacamole was $10 for 3-4 deep fried chips and a little dish of dip which was weirdly white and not very guac-like. 

I'm glad I stuck with a bottle of Creemore instead of shelling out $15 for a cocktail which although interesting didn't really give me confidence that it would actually be an authentic 1920s speakeasy drink. 

Nice wraparound patio that hangs over the street that might be worth trying for the view in the summer."}
{"text":"I went there on a professional networking event and found the place very dark, crowded and expensive for low quality drinks. I know that Speakeasy typically have a better consumer experience than this one, so I was a bit disappointed with the place. 

About the service, we barely had even the half of a smile from any of the staff working there. In fact, the best smiles that I got were from the company organizing the networking event, so that didn't work at this bar.

The best part of this evening was all the great professional contacts that I've made through networking, so I didn't waste my time. 

I would go again if there's another networking event organized there, but won't be going there just for fun in a friendly context."}
{"text":"As the name suggests, Speakeasy21 is first and foremost a pub - popped in for a quick, drink-free work lunch so am judging this place in the view restaurant food and keeping in mind that food was never meant to be the main draw.  On pure conjecture, the close second draw would be for this place to serve as an after-hours meat market for the financiers & salary men/office ladies.

That being said, I'm reviewing this place with the mindset that I'm not expecting a majorly deep or thought-provoking meal here, just some tasty, unpretentious, heavy-duty food meant to provide a tummy-nest for the imbibements. So here goes: I think this place is OK, although I agree with other reviews that this place is rather overpriced, but I feel like Speakeasy pays steeply for their prime location (prime location...meat market...*ba dum tssss*).  

The small menu is split into two styles:  Shared Plates and Mains.  Our table opted for the shared menu, choosing: Eggplant & Pepper Tapenade, Fried Cheese Curds, Beef Tartare, Three Layer Dip with tortillas, Baja Fish Taco, Butter Chicken Balls, Buffalo Chicken tacos and Popcorn Chicken.

The fried cheese curds are like a Canadian take on the fried mozzarella stick.  Fun, lacks the ooey-gooey appeal.  Beef Tartare tastes strongly of Parmesan, so go for it if you're a fan of this cheese but you'd better abstain otherwise as the force is quite strong in this one.  Baja Fish Tacos are served with a cute and miniature plastic squeezie bottle of (not spicy) hot sauce. Popcorn chicken isn't the Taiwanese/KFC type of popcorn chicken - these are chicken fingers with a popcorn crust (tbh, I thought it was just breading cause you can't really tell they're popcorns). If I recall correctly, butter chicken golf-ball sized meatballs come in a set of 3 - not as much flavour as you'd get from butter chicken at an Indian place.  Can't really expect too much of the food though - meh, it's a pub."}
{"text":"What can I say, this place is not my cup of tea. My family and I made reservations and decided to try this place after my graduation. 

The inside was nice, full bar and TVs everywhere; mainly sports on. Customer service was good, the drinks were good, the food was bad, mediocre at best. My parents and I ordered 3 steaks for each of us and the size was not worth the price, it didn't even come with a side order of fries or salad. Same thing for my brother and sister; they ordered mac & cheese and fish tacos respectively and the portions were not worth the price. I guess this place is more suited for customers who just want appetizers or a place to go for happy hour.

To conclude, I left this place still feeling hungry and I had to go get cheeseburgers from McDonald's to satisfy my hunger. The food was not worth the prices."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere, especially the patio in the summer.

The service was exceptional.  We were in a hurry for lunch and they put a rush on our order... it was out so quickly I was almost worried how they did that?! But it was much appreciated and I made my next meeting on time.

I had the turkey burger which was pretty good.  Big, juicy, and well dressed with fixins including guacamole.  It was a bit messy but worth it in the end.

Good spot, go check it out."}
{"text":"Way way way overpriced. Portions are puny and drinks are weak! There are plenty of other options for the $ spent here. $12 watered down drinks and $15-20 \"share plates\"? Nuts. 

Service is mediocre at best - waitress was missing most of the evening. We had someone with an allergy and wanted to make sure it was ok to eat, and she didn't get back to us about it. 

Definitely a miss!"}
{"text":"2 stars mainly for the excellent service. I have been here a couple of times. The first time was for drinks and the second time for lunch. Disappointing beers on tap. Ended up with a Stella or something similar (can't remember which one but mass produced crap stuff). Second time was interesting. They had a special of a fried eggplant sandwich so decided to go for that unfortunately. It was the greasiest thing my lips have ever touched and it tasted fishy. Seriously, use the same oil that you use to fry fish and chips and who knows how old! 

Gave up on the sandwich after a bite. It was an interview lunch so didn't want to send it back and look bad. Filled up in the fries and walked out never to return again. 

The location is quite convenient to a lot of people who work downtown. This restaurant can do so much. MYbe take formal feedback on the menu and get some suggestions from the public. As far as the beers are concerned, it is not that hard to add a popular craft beer such as Granville island on tap. 

If they ever relaunch as brand new, I will reconsider going back. I feel bad for the servers though. They were simply amazing throughout."}
{"text":"I work across the street so this is our go to after-work drinks place. It seems like we're not the only ones who think that because it sure gets really packed really quick on some days. They have some daily drinks specials that are pretty good, such as $5 beers or $10 doubles. 

They have a lot of shareables which is pretty good. Some of our usual orders include the fried chicken fingers and mac and cheese balls. I don't like their service though because the servers are always extremely slow and this has happened consistently on many occasions. 

Definitely come here for convenience or for work events, but if it's just another night out, maybe head elsewhere."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back here for lunch or dinner - maybe drinks.

The service was poor. Food took forever to come out (rare at lunch in the financial district). Prices are high. My steak was overdone. Nice atmosphere and my friend got a free birthday treat though."}
{"text":"The food that I got was phenomenally made (Baja fish tacos with a little lime for zest!) but the service was on the poorer side. I definitely would rate this higher if we only looked at food.

With more than one person serving our table, we had to repeatedly ask for refills on drinks or condiments. We also weren't given any water at our table until asked. I understand that it can get busy especially during lunchtime but I wish we were more attended to."}
{"text":"A nice spot in the summer with a fantastic patio on the financial district, this is one of the big selling points of coming to this spot that and the good drink specials they usually have. But it's usually packed full of professionals going to get a drink after a long day of work so getting a table will be hard let alone getting a server to take your order."}
{"text":"Speakeasy has been opened for approximately 4 months,  though a small pub fare foodie joint it has added a positive vibe to the financial district.
Located at Scotia Plaza I'm not surprised it's been considered one of the go-to places for after work food and drinks.  Every day Speaks has a special, so there's always something to look forwards to.
Our server was extremely, genuinely polite given this part of the downtown that can get quite pretentious. For drinks, since it was Friday,  we took advantage of their $4 bottles of beer..awesome! 

appetizers we shared their in house made beef tartar which was delightful to your taste buds.  Presentation was lovely,  pieces of meat were cut very small, however instead of them serving chips, it would have bee  better of they substituted it with crostini. 4/5

For main I ordered their one of their popular; fried chicken club, yum! Portion was big, satisfying and delish. This dish came with a house salad which added some healthy element to the dish lol!
....dessert.....sorry dude...no room..4/5
Overall Speakeasy 21 was a great experience, the ambiance is laid back, clean and a definite hit spot that I wouldn't think twice to visit :)"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch because it was the only place in the financial district that had availability for a group of 10 on a Friday. Now I know why they had availability. 

Sodium bomb. Everything. Salty for no reason. 

Ordered several apps and one didn't come but they tried to charge us for it. 

Salad drowning in dressing. 

Not worth the money and will not be back."}
{"text":"I went last week with a friend on a Wednesday night so it wasn't too busy, they have different specials everyday and Wednesday they have the 2 for 1 appetizers which was pretty awesome. We got the pork belly and the meatballs both were absolutely delicious, the pork belly was particularly amazing, had I known we would have just ordered two portions of the pork belly! 
For the mains, I thought I'd be a bit healthier and have a salad, so I got the kale Caesar salad with double smoked bacon.... Also delectable, a little salty for my tastes but still delicious. My friend ordered the steak which I only had a bite to try and I don't have much to say about it. 
The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star is because it is a little on the pricier side, I had 2 drinks, a 2 for one appetizers, and a salad the bill ended up being about $75 after tax and tip. The food is good, the place is very nice (it has a very old-comfy-rich kinda feel to it), the staff are fantastic and friendly, but if you're looking after your wallet maybe not somewhere you'd wanna go every day lol but I do recommend it for a nice night out!"}
{"text":"Location and layout of the restaurant is slightly weird but has a great bar scene. My sister and I came for winterlicious and ordered some drinks which didn't seem to have much alcohol in them. I ordered the curried cauliflower soup, pork chops, triple chocolate brownie. My sister ordered pork belly skewers, mac & cheese, and apple crumble. My cauliflower soup was way too salty and too seasoned and the server offered me another appetizer instead. My pork chop was nicely cooked but seemed a little boring even with its apple sauce. My sister enjoyed everything she ordered and would come back for another visit. I, on the other hand, would not."}
{"text":"We got charged full price for our drinks even though there was a special.

Everything else is quite pricey.

The owner is rude.  

The place itself is nice.."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and after work drinks but that about it. Food was horrible, no taste, over salted chips and butter chicken balls didn't  even taste like butter chicken . Wouldn't even eat if it was free. #truth #critic"}
{"text":"$4 a bottle happy hour Friday night after work? What could be better? Being in the Scotia tower, this place is necessarily banker/lawyer/suit city. Service is good and attentive. Shareable plates are reasonably priced for location."}
{"text":"It's kind of a late post, but I didn't really got a chance to write a review after the dinner. I was here on Jan 30 for winterlicious with my friends for dinner. It was on a weekday, there wasn't much people in the restaurant. Maybe like 3-4 tables was taken. 

As everyone knows, winterlicious is come with 3 dishes which is appetizer, main course and dessert. For appetizer I choose the soup, which is a hot soup but when it was serve, it's a warm soup. (I personally like hot food.) One of my friend choose the meatball which was good but same as mine which is warm not hot. 

For the main course I choose the salmon and it took so long to serve to us. And when it was serve to us, the food was cold. Well not like it was brought from the fridge. But it definitely was cooked for a well; been in the kitchen for a long time.

Overall the food was cold and serve so slow. I think I will not go back again. I really like to eat hot hot food. But the atmosphere there was alright."}
{"text":"Buddy had the Lavender Lemonada - smelled like lavender.. seemed ok.. I had hopsNbolts.. good times..

They have a huge cocktail list but sadly no moonshine-colada."}
{"text":"I spent a pleasant lunch hour with a colleague at SpeakEasy 21. First, our server was delightful. Her name is Sam. Ask for Sam, seriously. The hostess informed us the place was full but since they were new, she allowed us to have a look. We immediately found two single stools around the perimeter overlooking the courtyard at Scotiaplaza. The manager was quick to react and pulled the seats together, giving us a spot for lunch. While my colleague's tummy was a bit achy, we decided to have a whiskey and appetizer lunch. The newsprint style menus are interesting but very difficult to read as they are tall and keep folding over. She got a Glenmoranghie and I got a Brown Derby (bourbon, zest and honey) -- both enjoyable but Bay Street pricing. Our appetizers came quickly and the hot was hot and the cold was cold. First, succulent dates filled with cream cheese and wrapped in drippy but crispy bacon. Yum. Next, cauliflower hummus with pita/naan (not sure). We had to ask for more bread. Sam acknowledged it has been an issue and said that they were prepared for it and immediately brought us more hot and crispy pita/naan.

They are working on a deck to seat about 200 complete with its own bar. There are some interviews on websites that do more justice to their plans than me.

Overall, lovely servers and good food. The decor is sparse but the place isn't large and other than the kitchy phonebooths, you're there to be seen (lawyers, bankers, etc), and for good food and drinks. This joint will do well."}
{"text":"I was a bit surprised by this place. I came here after work on a Tuesday, just after 5 probably, on a Tuesday. I've walked by this place in the summer and I've seen quite a lively crowd outside on the patio. When we walked in, it was pretty empty, and we sat in the back corner in deep conversation, so we didn't notice the place filling in. About a half hour in we looked up to see the entire place filled with middle aged men in suits, which is all good, but just not the crowd I expected.

The drinks were cheap, the wings were low to mediocre, but the fries supreme - unexpected yumminess! I recommend them. I also have to say that the service was great. The waitress was very attentive and personable."}
{"text":"You can't beat the location! Easy to get to for a lunch meeting in the downtown core and connected to the PATH!

The bacon wrapped goat cheese stuffed dates were FABULOUS! We also shared butter chicken meatballs and samosas but the dates were the table's favorite!

Two if us had the fried chicken club and it was so tasty and freshly prepared. Probably the best fried chicken I have had in a while.

The other two at the table ordered tacos. You get to choose 2 or 3 when order and they are really small so I would recommend that you order 3.

All the seating is high-tops and bars tools which is not super comfortable.

The meal was good but to be honest, I don't think this place has anything special that makes it stand out from the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"\"An upscale pub\" is probably the best way to describe this place. 
Food is yummy and a little on the high end ... hence my comment above. 
Great to take a client out for lunch or drinks after work. 
Great service."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a friend (on a Monday evening).  Found this place by searching through old Winterlicious participants - it apparently won diners' choice (? or some other award) recently.  The crowd was 90% suits and 5% people doing shots and getting loud and drunk and 5% others.  The food was appetizing, wouldn't mind eating them again.  Service was standard, the rest rooms were decent.  (Yes, I'm one of those people who judge restaurants based on their rest rooms.)  The place was full, but not overly crowded by the time we left.  May return in the future sometime, but certainly wouldn't be high on my list."}
{"text":"My 8 workmates and I had a fabulous late lunch here today. We wanted to go somewhere close to the office and took a chance on SpeakEasy 21. We were not disappointed! I'm surprised to see the lower ratings for this place, as this was the opposite of our experience. 

I loved how they served savoury popcorn at the table while we waited for our order - a nice touch! I had the turkey burger with guac, arugula, and jalapeño relish - and ordered the smoked bacon as an extra topping. I thought the burger was delicious and I think the bacon helped (how couldn't it?). Don't be afraid of the relish - it wasn't spicy at all. My meal came with a lovely green salad in a marvellous vinaigrette. Others at my table ordered the smoked mac n' cheese, pork belly, fish tacos, ceviche, smoke chicken slaw and steak salad. Everyone said they really enjoyed the food.

Our server was lovely and prompt. There was a very slight delay in getting the last two meals to the table - we barely noticed, but regardless, the chef sent out 3 desserts for us to share to make up for it. The triple chocolate brownie was good, but the trifle was amazing - and I'm not normally a trifle fan! It reminded me of when I was a kid tasting my mom jam after boiling on the stove. So fresh and delish!

I think the prices are reasonable and you can get a nice glass of wine for $9.

Will be back!"}
{"text":"I was there for birthday celebration/redo of sorts.
 I had been there this past summer and had an awful experience, so I decided that since it was a friends birthday, and he wanted to go to an out of the way place we would try there. I got there before him as I had to speak to our server about making sure he Didn't touch the cheque, I was  stunned to see for a lunch time crowd it was virtually empty! Our server was nice, the music WAY to loud for the lack of people in the restaurant, and the food was less than meh! We both ordered pop which was watered down, and coffee that was undrinkable! I was less impressed than I had been this summer!  Even the birthday boy wasn't wowed, that isn'[t good! 
In short, Great location, good service, below meh food/drink and atmosphere! I don't think there will a third try!"}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious lunch and was extremely disappointed.
Our table had chairs that looks as uncomfortable as bar stools. Would have requested to change tables, but seems to be the only type available.
Had white soap marks in my glass so requested to swap it but the server tried to reason how it wasn't dirty...she did it in the end but tried very hard in making me feel bad about it.
Got salad as the first course, it was simple and fresh, but just a salad. My friend got the truffle popcorn, it was okay but the presentation was just popcorn in a plain sad bowl.
Main was a pork belly burger, with a side of....salad. The salad side was omitted on menu, so felt a little scammed of getting the app. The butter bun doesn't hold the structure well, bottom was soggy from the pork belly grease. A ciabatta or pretzel bun would work much nicer. Pork belly was also just okay, no melt in your mouth action but passable.
My friend's trout skin was burnt and she can only eat it with it ripped off.
Trifle wasn't super pretty but definitely the highlight of my meal. Berries were tart and the jelly moistened the fluffy sponge. Mouthfuls of whip to meld the whole thing!
Server was inattentive and gave a rude vibe.
As a whole, will not return to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"I have no problem paying good money for good food.  I don't, however, like spending good money on mediocre food.

I paid $15 for a very average Brown Derby cocktail, $17 for a sandwich similar to a filet-o-fish with a hot dog on it and $14 for three butter chicken meatballs.  The latter were decent but still a bit pricey.  The definition of a speakeasy is a place which sold illegal alcohol during prohibition. The biggest crime here was the price of the food and drink.  In addition, you should be able to speak in a speakeasy right?  It was too loud.  

 The service was OK but the waitstaff looked a bit like members of the Jersey Shore going to a prohibition party.  Snooki once said \"I feel like a pilgrim from the freaking '20s washing this s--t right now\". 

I felt like a pilgrim watching it."}
{"text":"Convenient location for after work drinks in Scotia Plaza. Seating is mostly high tops and there are televisions tuned to sports. Long bar with no seats (!?). Oddly the draft beer selection is thin...4 choices, one of which they had run out of (you had one job to do...). Food menu is burgers, sandwiches, salads and a so so selection of shareable. Friendly server. It's ok for drinks unless you are into draft beer."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Once for drinks and once for summerlicious dinner. Both times were disappointing and not terribly enjoyable. 

Thursday night drinks: complete dude show and if you're a woman with a group of women, forget getting decent service. 

Summerlicious: the food was terrible. Actually, the kale salad was quite delicious. I would have really liked to finish it, however, Speakeasy has taken the timing of courses away from their servers for Summerlicious. Our main course appeared when we were half way through the salad. The food runner offered to put it under the heat lamp until I was finished. Um, no thank you! FAIL. FAIL. FAIL. Looking at the prices on the menu for the meal, I expect better service even during Sunmerlicious. The salad was the best part of the meal. 

Overpriced food and drinks and the air of alpha male expense account entitlement. No thank you."}
{"text":"Easy to walk away from maybe - but not easy to go back to - ever!

Just had lunch. Ordered the salad, with raw tuna. Although the fish (apparently) came in today, it had a slimy texture and was off - had a metal taste to it. When I first told the waitress of my issue, she said \"it is raw tuna\"! She didn't understand my concerns. Ultimately, the manager came over and while she was quite pleasant, she claimed the chef tasted the tuna when it was delivered earlier in the day and was fine with it. Well, I wasn't.

There might be a decent vibe there for drinks, but the food was unacceptable. The menu was so uninteresting that I took a pass on a replacement dish."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere is drab. Brown leather, dark wood, brick, blah. There's also a major disconnect with the volume levels there: the music is either way too loud for a post-work crowd wanting to be able to chat (it's night club level at 6 PM) or if they're playing a big game then the television is BLASTING. Maybe their sound guy needs his hearing checked?

As for the food, the tacos for the Tues special are bland and on wonderbread type white tortillas. The baby kale cesar is just a heap of kale with dressing on it and after making my way half through I was just sick of eating it. The lettuce wraps are decent.

There are plenty of other better spots to check out in that area. Don't bother... the patio can be nice on a hot day though. Very 'suits' type of crowd, mostly men."}
{"text":"Drinks are alright. Food is good. A pretty standard place in downtown toronto for after work fare. Nothing to rave about though."}
