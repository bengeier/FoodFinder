{"text":"Used Uber Eats today for the first time and had a wonderful experience with this restaurant.  The Chicken Biryani and the samosas were delicious.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great paneer, roti, samosas, momas and biryani rice. Definitely come back to this local spot. Best restaurant in carrick. Friendly service. Warmly welcome this establishment into the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I ate veg momo, veg chowmein and vegetable soup. I was expecting more vegetables in my soup but it was good. Polite customer service. I liked how it wasn't too salty and oily and less ajinomoto (in food). Also had more momo pieces then other regular Nepali restaurants I've been to which is great."}
{"text":"Very authentic nepali food. When we first entered, I had doubts about the place. The interior needs some upgrade. But the food was mind blowing. Even though it had limited menu, I'd highly recommend this place. All the food we ordered were very tasty and full of flavors. Both chicken and pork momo were really good. And veg thali was also pretty good. But chicken chowmein was outstanding. Reminded me of days when I used to eat this in Nepal. We loved this place!"}
{"text":"This is the best Nepali restaurant you will find in Pittsburgh. Pork sekuwa is the best. Best customer service."}
{"text":"I love this place. As someone who moved to Carrick when I was in high school and have watched the neighborhood basically go down hill, I am SO happy that  people are moving here and opening businesses. Extra happy that those businesses include great restaurants like the Nepali Asian Restaurant.

First off, the owner is super nice and welcoming. My friend and I visited and he gave us recommendations and even two lassi drinks on the house. We ordered the chicken momo, chicken chali, and vegetable samosa. Everything was AMAZING. I visited again with my mom and we ordered the spicy chicken---also excellent.I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. Friendly staff, great service, and excellent food!  They are also on UberEats and offer take out.  I know I will be visiting here every time I am back in town."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here for the first time today. Ordered the Chicken Biryani and Samosas. Both were incredibly delicious! I think they accidentally through in a vegetable soup that was also amazing! Highly recommend!"}
