{"text":"Our server was awesome, she knew the menu well and explained things thoroughly.

The Lobster Pot Pie has one tiny piece of lobster in it. For $28 one would expect all the meat from the claws and tails. It was made with a medley of frozen vegetables. They definitely were not fresh. Instead of lobster they used some fish. If I wanted a fish pot pie then I would have asked for that. But I think they try to fool people by having fish in there. They try to deceive.

The calamari was pretty good, charcuterie plate was hit and miss, steak over cooked and pasta was average. 

The server was the highlight of the night. A caring and attentive individual."}
{"text":"Great staff, food was excellent and so well presented. Had the arancini to start, pork tenderloin was super tender and finished with Apple crumble. Not sure why previous reviewers aren't onboard with The Block. Even my Dad liked it"}
{"text":"The best thing about the Block kitchen & Lounge, is that McDonald's is across the street. I wonder if business has picked up since it opened. 
First time I followed a review from JOHN GILCHRIST top 10 restaurants picks of 2014 from the Calgary herald and it is certainly the LAST TIME I will ever take his advice. The Block was #8 on the top 10 list. And frankly I don't think it should be in any list other than a list of restaurants to avoid. I seriously question the creditability of the other restaurants mentioned in the article.

The food was barely mediocre and for the price! I felt being robbed at gunpoint might have been cheaper. The steak when asked medium well came out ocean blue. So blue I swear I can hear it still moooing. The Pear and WALNUT salad came with no walnuts. Two orders of the exact same pasta came one with garlic toast and one with out. You'd think they were made at the same time. The Block Caesar was 1/3 Worcestershire sauce and 2/3 Tabasco and I think an ounce of water. 

Service was not very efficient but it was a little busy.  The highlight was probably that our server was very nice. So nice that it almost made you forgive for all the wrong orders, missing items, and late drinks.  ALMOST. 

Maybe I'm being to harsh. Maybe I came on an OFF...OFF.....so OFF Night. Though I don't know how more off you can get. Or maybe I came during another \"menu change\" as an excuse for the not so appetizing food. 

BTW we ordered:

Bread basket 

Chicken wings (best thing we tried but that ain't saying much) 

Potato chip prawns (I think the prawns were going bad. It was a bit sour but the sauce masked it well) 

Salmon gravlax (salmon tasted little too fishy but over all ok)

Pears & Walnut (it was like salad in a bag from Safeway with out the walnuts)

Lobster mac and cheese (I prefer Kraft Dinner)

Paradelle meatball (not bad. Meat balls a little gamey for my taste)

Lobster pot pie (my friend puked afterwards. She thinks it was the over spicy caesar)

Artic char (little bit dry but it was ok)

Sirloin steak (mooooooo)

I've concluded that the Block must have a lot of good friends for so many good reviews or the new intern was cooking alone tonight. I hope things change for their sake. But even if it does I will not risk returning."}
{"text":"I want this place to be good but it just isn't. The food is bland and overpriced. I wish they would stop trying to do fine dining and aim for something they could execute on, although since they can't make decent mac and cheese or chicken wings I'm not sure exactly what that would be. I feel like this place has promise, but on my fourth visit the only thing they've done consistently is disappoint. Maybe I'm just trying to wish them into being better because I want more decent dining choices in my neighbourhood. Be better The Block! I won't be back until you ditch this latest menu iteration and even then I'm not sure I want to give you another chance."}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to try The Block for quite a while. I finally had a chance to drop in for dinner tonight (Friday). The place was buzzing, possibly because there was a Flames game happening the same evening although I think it was mostly because it was a Friday. It was a bit of a dine and dash. Had a glass of malbec, which was a little pricey but not out of line for this sort of place. For dinner, I had the duck, which was excellent.
The service was friendly but unremarkable. I will definitely go back to sample other items on the menu and sooner or later I will have that duck again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant. It's in my neighborhood, had a great sounding menu and they recently reopened after a flood requiring major renos. 
I went with my sister and another friend for brunch. Our waitress was nice, though a little clutzy. (Spilled our water all over, forgot my coffee...these missteps  would have been totally forgiveable on their own however). We ordered two of the frittatas and the special, a breakfast pizza. One fritata (looking a biy crispy) and the breakfast pizza came out, and the waitress assured me that my frittata was on its way...they were just adding more cheese on top to \"make it more delicious\".  I thought it was a little strange as my friend's frittata didn't have any cheese on top, but I wasn't too concerned at this point.  
When my frittata arrived, it was obvious that it had been burnt and the extra cheese was meant to cover up the burntness.  Ummm, not cool. 
The breakfast pizza was pretty bland. The only good part was the bacon. 
I really hope my experience was a one-off and the service and food improves soon as I'd love to support a local and independent restaurant. I won't be going back however until I see some good reviews post-renovation."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by for lunch on a Saturday. The restaurant was empty, which always worries me, but in this case it was OK. More people may have been in the lounge section.

We ordered beef carpaccio, pizza dough with olive oil and herbs that comes with a marinara sauce, and an order of fried calamari. I thought the calamari was the best. They were tender with a tasty sauce on the side. The portion of beef seemed small compared to other places we've been too, although they did put a lot of arugula on top which I like. The flavour of the meat was good, but bland, not a lot of seasoning. The pizza bread had an odd sour taste and could have used a more fragrant olive oil and more herbs as it was pretty bland. I used more of the marinara sauce than I would normally to try to ramp up the flavour.

Overall, the meal was OK. There was nothing \"wrong\" with it, but it also wasn't that exciting. Maybe we should have ordered different items, but we just wanted to try the appies. I don't think I'd rush back based on this experience.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice. Beautiful \"vintage\" woods give the plain jane interiors a bit of warmth. The service was great. Very attentive. I appreciate that the female wait staff were in simple clothes and not \"tarted\" up like they are in so many chain restos.

{"text":"I was here for a vine and dine event so we got to sample a fair amount of the menu as well as some great wines off their wine list. There was not one of our courses that I was disappointed in, they were all fabulous!
While it may be true that the outside of the place is not the prettiest, who cares? The inside is painted with gorgeous soothing teals framed with beautiful wood work and accented by some really fun light fixtures. I love the use of antiques throughout and the bar guy was one really nice dude. He can mix up a really great Cherry Manhattan that's for sure! I found that both the seats at the bar and at the tables were extremely comfortable...and this is a huge pet peeve of mine; restaurants that have uncomfortable seating.  I just find it more welcoming if the restaurant has taken my comfort into consideration...and I will stay longer AND eat/drink more!
The restaurant was quite busy for a Wednesday night, so I did find it a bit noisy but nothing out of the ordinary. I think it was only because I was with a larger group and trying to listen to our event host.
The food. I will say again that it was delicious. Beautifully presented and well seasoned. 
We had House Made Salmon Gravlax, Roast Cauliflower Croquette with Curry Aioli, Shrimp, Fennel, and Watercress Salad, Mini Wagyu Beef burgers, Bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, and ended with Butterscotch Pie. The butterscotch pie is worth the drive to The Block in itself.
I think it's great that non chain restaurants are migrating to the 'burbs. There's more parking and way less traffic. If I lived closer to The Block I would probably be a regular by now."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Didn't check yelp or John Gilchrist first, just happened to find it a couple of weeks ago and it's already a huge favorite.

Service is the best -- on our 2nd visit the server remembered us and what we ate the first time!  We always ask for her section now.

With bringing other people by to try it out we are averaging twice a week so we've pretty much tried the entire menu and never found anything we didn't like -- the sweet potato perogies are a huge hit.  There are a couple of allergies in our group and they always get helpful advice about the ingredients.

Great service; wonderful food and a welcoming, relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. We met another couple on a Monday night btw half price bottles of wine Monday nights. Atmosphere was relaxed. No loud music blaring so you could hear each other talk. Great wine list! Started with the Duck Poutine....delish, Steak Tartar....wow. Our main course were a good portion size and hot and so very flavourful!!
Dessert was the crème brulee........ yum and the flourless brownie...now that's chocolate!! Plenty of parking. Server was great and knowledgeable. Check it out..... you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"We eat here frequently on the lounge side and are always happy with the food and the service. Lots of interesting specials. They do fish and beef particularly well. Servings are generous. Servers are friendly and efficiently. Recently we picked up a takeout order and found one small item to be missing. No big deal, we never followed up. A week later we ate there and our server remembered, apologized profusely and comped us our first round of drinks. My only concern is that I wish it was busier as I'd hate to see this neighbourhood spot close down. Oh, plenty of parking and very accessible."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner with friends and we ordered the following: roasted cauliflower croquettes which was tasty, salmon gravlax which was just ok. They served it on a rye crisp which is not home made which was disappointing. Pear & walnut salad which was pretty good. The compromise salad we asked if they can add goat cheese, which they did. This salad was disappointing, the roasted squash was diced in little cubes which was a mistake, the salad which contains spinach and arugula, the taste of roasted squash was lost in the salad, the dressing a pear vinegrette was bland could not even taste the pear due to the strong taste of arugula and spinach, the cranberries were way to dry almost hard on a few. The beef ribs were good and tender, fall off the bone with a tasty bbq sauce. The perogies were good and the sage butter was tasty. Food temp was great. All in all i will come here again but will not order the same things again."}
{"text":"When I saw this place pop up in my neighbourhood, I made a point to go check it out. They've done an amazing job with the interior decor - it's warm and homey and slightly rustic. Unfortunate that they can't do much to spruce up the outside though.

The server that we had was great - informative and attentive without being overbearing. I ended up having the special (which was veal) and it was delicious. My BF ordered the pork shoulder which was good, but I found the portion to be a little small. 

All in all, a touch pricey (a glass of wine was $18) but definitely good quality. Can't wait to go back and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Went to The Block for a date night and was sure the place would be packed at 7pm so made a reservation online, was really surprised at how empty it was. But maybe considering the location it is more of a weekend spot than Monday night, or the 4th Spot up the street is giving them some competition as they were packed when we drove past. 

The decor is lovely and open - the restaurant is HUGE and divided into the restaurant side and lounge side by a giant wine rack that doesn't make the restaurant feel divided at all. Love the rustic and re-purposed furniture and the 12 seater chefs table looks like a great place for a group to enjoy a meal without being separated from the restaurant completely. They have a lovely little patio which in good weather I imagine will be packed. 

Only thing I would change is the view through the window of the Golden Arches - but they really have no control over that.

Service was excellent and the server gave us all the time we needed to order and enjoy the evening out without feeling rushed. As a side note when we finished the meal she took the time to wait until our wine was nearly done before dropping off the bill which was much appreciated. 

Slightly disappointed that one each of the cocktails (of only 4 on the list), mains and wines I selected were out but was told the menu is changing in a little while to their fall menu. This is a massive pet peeve for me - if you don't have it then don't have it on the menu, and if you do have it on the menu then please commit to having it. Alternatively please let me know the second I sit down that you are out of this item. This saves breaking my heart over not being able to try something that sounds delicious.

The cauliflower croquettes were delicious and the curry aioli mild enough to not overpower the subtle flavours of the dish. Would definitely eat that again. I had the lamb for mains which was tender and juicy, plus the kitchen had taken the time to trim the fat from the cut of meat which I always appreciate in lamb. Delicious flavour. My partner had the lobster pot pie, and while the pie and filling were great both of us were disappointed with the shellfish gravy. It was more of a broth and only thickened at all because of the potatoes in it. Both of us concurred we would have loved if the filling had been more of a thick lobster chowder. 

Didn't get dessert as both of us were pretty full which is always a good indication of well sized portions. 

Overall would definitely give them another try in a couple of months when they are well into their new menu. Do wish them success as the area could use another restaurant of this quality and feel once they will get there you will always need a reservation to get in."}
{"text":"Super slow service, food was middle of road and when my wife's tuna melt crostini appetizer showed up ice cold we said something and the waitress had it remade. Not sure if we'll be back in the near future but we may try it again in a few months."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and it was a mediocre experience for the price tag of brunch.  The menu items ordered were meh, largely as there were comments how the food was cold, for the breakfast burrito and sandwich. My pizza was tasty, but as a pizza lover- I rarely offer bad pizza reviews and am open to all pizzas.  Service was attentive and pleasant.  Looking forward to the new menu- hopefully a return to a style of items that were great when it first opened- butterscotch pie, lobster mac and cheese, spinach salad with poached egg...."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in The Block. We had high hopes because it is in our neighborhood but it's just not up to par. 3 of the items we wanted were not available apparently due to a change in menu. This has been posted by ppl writing previous reviews so I'm thinking its an excuse. If a restaurant is out of potatoe skins there's a problem. The tuna melt I ordered was ice cold and when talking to the manager we were told that's the way it's served... Really? The soup was good but my dining partner was pretty sure the wings had been previously frozen, not good when you're paying these prices. In the last week I have dined in 2 upscale dt restaurants at the same price as tonight and the food was amazing. I don't mind spending my hard earned money when the food is done the way it should be. The manager took off the chicken wings but it was too little too late. It's never fun complaining and in the long run we were doing him a service. For a restaurant that's only been open 6 weeks 
They should be trying harder than that. If you want to pay those prices go dt where you know it's up to par. We will never go back."}
{"text":"Came for the brunch, pleasantly surprised with the skinless sausage, perfectly poached eggs and grilled tomatoes. Great atmosphere to chill out on a Sunday morning with no kids options on the menu! I've been enjoying the specials at night as well. Way to turn it around guys!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch. The store was not very busy. Services was fast. Although I opted out, my friends said their alcoholic beverages were great. I found the price quite high. I had their lunch specials--cod sandwich with corn chowder. The chowder was awesome! It was flavorful and hot. However, I found the sandwich somewhat bland in taste and oily. Nothing for me to rave about. The eggs Benedict were also a let down as minimal hollandaise sauce was on the eggs. The whole plate also looked sad with the price we paid for."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We shared a burger and a quinoa and goat cheese salad. The place is separated into a restaurant and a bar so you can go with family or drinks with friends. Good beer menu."}
{"text":"I miss Rembrandt's!  Second time since they opened. Dissapointed both times. Price/value equation just isn't there. Food was acceptable. Drinks expensive. I'm afraid this may be fatal In  this economic climate."}
{"text":"I don't typically write reviews because I understand people have different expectations and tastes, but The Block is the kind of place where I would be contrite to not share the appalling experience we had - particularly since it was voted one of Calgary's best restaurants of 2014 in a Calgary Herald article. 

Arrival/greeting: 
It took 10 minutes after being seated to receive menus and water

DRINKS:
I love a good caeser and ALWAYS order one. Although the first couple sips were good, the caeser took 15 minutes to arrive and despite stirring it, it was so overseasoned I felt like I was drinking worchesterchire. 

APPI'S 
CAULIFLOWER CROQUETTES: Batter was perfect and inside was warm and creamy and sauce complimented perfectly.
POTATO CHIP CRUSTE PRAWNS: Small, tasteless, obviously frozen and tasted as if just defrosted in cold water with no flavor.
SALMON GRAVLAX: Good, nothing special. Smoked salmon on rye crisps with a creamy dill sauce - I can make it at home
BREAD AND BUTTER: $3 for a \"selection of bread\" which only consisted of 3 oven warmed premade dinner rolls similar to the kinds you would find at Cob's bread if I am being generous and flavored butter - not worth it. 
CHICKEN WINGS: Again bland, but breading was crisp and wing was moist and tender

PEAR AND WALNUT SALAD: $14 for a salad the size of a sandwich Tupperware which came at the end of the appi's because the waitress forgot. It was also MISSING THE WALNUTS. After dividing it up and realizing this we waited 10 minutes for the waitress to come back and when we informed her, she responded \"oh haha I guess they're missing, I'll go find you some.\"

MAINS
SIRLOIN STEAK: Completely undercooked. After waiting for the waitress for 15 minutes our hungry friend just started eating the steak which was blue and dripping blood. When the waitress finally returned, he simply informed her that the steak wasn't cooked how he wanted, but he was hungry so was eating it anyways. Her response, \"well let me check if you actually asked for that.\" After finding on her notepad that he did she simply said, \"I could have taken it back but you've eaten part of it so haha I guess I can't do anything now.\"
LOBSTER POT PIE: Precooked pot pie ingredients with a small lobster claw chopped up and thrown in after. Lobster was fishy and best thing about the pie was the crust. There was so little actual filling that it didn't even reach the top of the dish. 
LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE: Flavorless, our friend took most of it home to add some truffle salt and truffle oil to improve it
MEATBALL PAPPAREDELLE: Two people at our table ordered this, one came with slices of olive bread and the other had none. When we pointed this out the waitress again said, \"oh I guess it must be missing, I'll go see if I can find you some.\"
ARCTIC CHAR: Slightly overcooked but seasoned very well with crisp skin. 

Whatever the Block was serving the critics from the CH article must have been a different caliber of food or makes me seriously question John GilCrhists credability. What we had completely missed the mark and had all of us thinking that the McDonalds across the parking lot would have been a better choice. The bland food, missing items on our dishes and the poor quality and execution of what we had is not at all on par with their high prices. I travel often and have dined at many places around the world, restaurants like these in Calgary masked by a façade of hip and pretty décor continue to disappoint me with their lack of proper customer service and quality of food - we never once recieved an apology from the waitress for our missing ingredients/items."}
{"text":"This is our favourite restaurant in Calgary! Food never disappoints and the service is awesome!"}
{"text":"The Block has really grown on me. I live nearby and they have really improved since reopening. The service is always amazing. The food can be hit or miss, but I keep going back for the schnitzel and fries (which also comes with a salad and is only $9 on Mondays). I also like anything that comes with their amazing pickled red onions (calamari and spinach couscous salad). I would buy those onions by the jar. They have all day breakfast (which I haven't tried) and are open late. I'm happy to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Joined friends for a birthday dinner. This was my first time here since it became The Block and I was very impressed. Food was excellent (my new fave caesar salad!, tenderloin steak done medium, housemade cheesecake for dessert (I hope this one - white chocolate something something - gets into the werkly rotation), and decaf Umbria coffee to round the meal out - SUCH great coffee!). The prices are on par for the quality of food but I did feel that my meal was on the small side - the steak was probably 4 to 6 oz of deliciousness, but it wouldn't have hurt my feelings if the portion of mashed potatoes had been doubled. ;)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very close to my home, so I was very excited to see who wanted to try and compete with the very busy 4th Spot.
Some friends from out of town wanted to go out for supper, so I suggested The Block! It was a Sunday on the long weekend, and while everyone was out of town mostly, it was busier than they'd anticipated.  Not busy, but busier.  Some highlights:  The restaurant was gorgeous, beautiful carved wooden table, gorgeous lighting and great chairs.  It's a cool atmosphere inside despite the outside looking like this is a bar where VLTs come to die.
The server was sweet and nice, even allowed my friend to sample some of the ales on tap before committing to one.  
Now for the downsides.. because it was busier than they'd expected, they were OUT of some items on the menu.   Which weren't brought to our attention prior to deciding on food.  It would've been nice to know food wasn't an option before deciding on it. This normally wouldn't be a big deal, but they already have a small menu to begin with and they were out of the pasta, flatbread AND chicken main. 
I ordered a latte and was literally brought approx. 3 ounces of latte.  For $4.  Yeesh.  So tiny.  
Again, our server was very, very sweet but never around.  She took terribly long amounts of time coming to our table to take orders, ask how food was, etc.  Whenever we needed her she wasn't even in the restaurant, she was hiding in the back.  We ordered the deep fried dill pickle slices and they were delicious!  I had the arctic char, which was good but the sides seemed like they were under a lamp.  Disappointing.  My husband was disappointed with his pork shoulder as well.  No desserts here, but in the end we spent over 2 hours here for what should've been an hour - 1.5 hours.  Definitely disappointed with the service and food quality that evening.  I might drop in again in the future for a quick pint, but all in all I don't think they're ready to compete yet with 4th Spot."}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret in the NW.  The chef here does very well in on the restaurant side.  I had the roast chicken breast and it was wonderful!   The service is attentive and for the lounge lovers, the beef dip is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The ribs were delicious, sweet and savory and super tender. Nice, laid-back atmosphere and emphasis on fresh ingredients. Definitely try out the beef tartare too!"}
