{"text":"Vermicelli and imperial rolls and Tonkenese soup always well prepared. Consistently tasty Vietnamese food. Yum!"}
{"text":"4 Starts for original atmosphere, ecclectic crowd, honest food and fair price. Totally hit the spot."}
{"text":"Les meilleurs nouilles en ville. Le bouillon est excellent et c'est le secret de bonnes nouilles. Ce petit restaurant familial offre une ambiance... familiale, très agréable. Un must pour les amateurs.  Ils ont aussi un menu plus complet mais comme je suis fou de leur nouilles, je ne veux rien d'autre."}
{"text":"J'ai mangé des nouilles Pho dans plusieurs restaurants, dans plusieurs villes, mais je n'ai  jamais réussi à en trouver qui soit aussi bonnes qu'ici. Les meilleurs nouilles de Montréal !"}
{"text":"After walking around looking for the best Vietnamese food around, I ended up stopping here to eat because to be honest, I liked the wood paneling on the walls.  The décor made Thanh-Long seen more homemade and the staff was hanging out near the kitchen, rolling spring rolls and laughing.  It just seemed overall inviting to me.

The Che Ba Ma really hit the spot- a mix of shaved ice, sweet beans and jellies in coconut milk.  My husband had the fresh lemonade.  However, the food here was just mediocre, and nothing really stood out to me as being excellent.  I ordered the pork chop plate with rice- the pork chop was marinated and thin cut, on the bone and tender.  The rice was a little burnt.  The Goi Cuon, salad rolls were fairly bland and the vegetables inside were not that fresh.  The peanut sauce needed more hoisen and sriracha added to give it flavor, which I added at the table.  

My husband ordered the Pho Ga with shrimp, which was also very bland and only had one, yes one, shrimp in it.   After watching the lady up front roll the fried spring rolls, I realized that I definitely should have given that a try as well.  There are so many good Vietnamese restaurants to choose from in Montreal, so we will continue trying.  The best I have had so far was on a cold day in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Yum!

The ambiance of this restaurant isn't that exciting, but the food is good and that's the most important part. I went for pho rare beef and the fried spring rolls and it totally hit the spot. The broth was clear and clean-tasting (by which I mean it didn't have a greasy mouthfeel) but it wasn't as rich or flavorful as my favorite Vietnamese spot back home. However, the portion size was really generous, especially the quantity of thin-sliced beef."}
{"text":"This place looks like a hole in the wall and basically it is....but honest to god it's got the best Tonkinese soup I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Pho Thanh Long
This weekend I went to Pho Thanh Long for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised. I was also amused by the pop music from the 80's and 90's, I wonder if it's always like that. Anyway for 11.50$ I got tea, spring rolls, and a huge bowl of noodles, chicken and veggies. The service was ultra fast, and it was as tasty as much more expensive restaurants. It has become my first choice of restaurant now and I'm sure to go again."}
{"text":"Thanh Long has everything you would expect from a  Vietnamese restaurant from the decoration to the music and what's on the menu.

I tried a rare steak pho (my favorite amongst phos). It was ok but nothing too special. The beef was a bit too raw and stayed too chewy. Noodles were plain and not tasty enough.

There are better choices in Montreal but it's still worth a try."}
{"text":"The food quality in Montreal always impresses me. This was no exception. I first visited this restaurant with a few of my friends a year ago. I came back a little over a month ago with some other friends and convinced them that this place is a must-go! The authenticity of the pho and other noodle dishes are incomparable. I tried the bun rieu oc this time around and it was amazing. Additionally, one of the owners remembered me from my visit a year ago, which was such a pleasant surprise. Since the people who work here speak so many languages, I have had a conversation with them in Vietnamese and my friends have had conversations with them in Tagalog and Cantonese."}
{"text":"Vietnamese cuisine is one of my favorite and I must say this restaurant left me speechless! I had noodles with pork and spring rolls and omg their rolls are good! It's not the fanciest though, more like a casual spot but for the price you really get what you pay for. It's cheap, and perfect for college students"}
{"text":"Decent spot that I try to hit every time I'm in town   Friendly staff and fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"Maybe things are just more expensive in Montreal.

Like upside-down land where Asian food and Mexican tacos ardmore expensive than a cheap steak or burger.

$12.00 for a bowl of noodles.

Yeah you read that right.

In San Francisco the average is about $8.

Bigger and better in the United States for sure, but this bowl of noodles was okay.

The price is on the steep side though."}
{"text":"Go here if you're craving a gigantic bowl of super tasty soup for almost no money.
Nine bucks got me the biggest bowl of soup I have ever seen, and for 3 extra dollars I got me some nice raw beef to dump in it whilst grinning from ear to ear.
Did I finish said enormous bowl? No..I don't think I have that much room in my stomach...but I tried, oh how I tried. 

P.S. Don't come here for the service, I think smiles cost extra."}
{"text":"This restaurant is kind of rustic with the paneling and internal cupboards, and the soothing music. We were greeted instantly by the owner and the waitress was attentive. Our spoken French is very weak but she was understanding us. We ordered the pho ga and vegetable pho and they came out fast and Fresh! The broth was clear and delicious.  The vegetables were crisp and bright! The prices were very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Living in cities all my life with great Pho and other Vietnamese food, I was severely disappointed by the price and the quality of this neighborhood joint. The soup was very bland, barely any flavor, and was WAY too expensive! 

We did get the spring rolls which were decent, so thumbs up for that, again, pretty expensive for the portion size. 

I would have given this place 3 stars overall for the food, but since the service sucked so hard, didn't refill water glasses, had to ask a few times, barely understood english, and brought us the wrong dish, granted they did fix it after, but STILL! On top of that, our server was sincerely grouchy. Do we tip before if we want a smile from the staff? Yup, you just lost a star for the unnecessary attitude.

My sincere opinion. Skip it, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"During our stay in Montreal it was hard not to miss home cooked Asian meals. A bowl of noodles in the order. One of the best things around Montreal was where we stayed, Hyatt Regency Montreal. It is dead center of downtown with accessible underground subways stations that lead from Complexe Deshardins, Place D' Armes and Palce des Arts metro stations. A brisk walk underground leads us to Saint-Urbain and De La Gauchetière Street - the back roads of Montreal Chinatown (Le quartier chinois de Montréal). 

Chinatown in Montreal really isn't too big and is much smaller than Vancouver's. In fact, there are more Vietnamese Pho eateries than there are of wonton noodles. I heard lots of good things about the authenticity of the Pho noodles at Pho Thanh Long and we were super excited to try it.

The soup is tasty and not very oily, but the real winner was their Mong dry vermicelli noodles. Lots of chicken slices with prawns. There was a lot of ingredients and they didn't skimp out. The spring rolls were tasty and wasn't too oily. Added with some fish sauce mixed with chili oil really made our day!

There isn't a lot of reviews on Urbanspoon nor Yelp. But if you ever check in with Foursquare you will see a lot of good word of mouth!"}
{"text":"My mom's Vietnamese so I've had my share of good Vietnamese food.  I decided to try this one with a friend but he's not Asian so I was cautious.  In the restaurant, there were only non-Asians (first warning sign).  I ordered the grilled beef vermicelli as the standard meal for comparison.  The noodles came under-cooked and the beef was cut into small pieces and stir-fried instead of grilled.   I ended up only eating the meat from the bowl and left all the noodles.  Average by Asian standards :)  My goto place is still Pho Bang New York on St-Laurent."}
{"text":"I love variety - and their menu gives you plenty to try with each entree. I had a vermicelli noodle bowl with beef (which was excellent and the most flavorful I've ever had). The Pho is delicious as well as the banana dessert dish."}
{"text":"best vietnamese soup around, their raw beef is just awsome!! I had similar soup in other restaurants around and they were never that good!  Fresh mint and sprouts, fresh lime, a tea and the best buillon and raw beef you ever had.   thinly sliced raw beef that browns in your hot buillon!!"}
{"text":"La carte est à 20% vietnamienne et 80% sautés plutôt chinois. J'ai pris un bun au porc qui était correct. Mais mon ami a juste pris un dessert 3 couleurs et il était malade 1-2h après. J'ai eu beaucoup de mal à digérer aussi. 
Dommage :("}
{"text":"spring rolls large, good wrapper, uneventful inside with old lettuce. picture shows fish sauce, served with very light colored peanut sauce

Pho broth was decent but no depth. noodles were light. LOTS of meat

zero Asians here at lunch on a Tuesday, but everyone knew what they were ordering, so obviously a repeat and loyal lunch crowd.

Lunch specials look interesting. next time would try the D :)

So...probably a good place if you work in the area and want a quick cheap meal, but don't expect much more than that"}
{"text":"Standard asian iccidental food, very accomodate the proximity with the theatre Metropolis if you are attenging a show and the price is raisonable .
The place have not extraordinary ventilation so its perfect for smell asian fiod all day long ;)"}
