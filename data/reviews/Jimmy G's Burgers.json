{"text":"Great place for fresh burgers in Phoenix. Bun is great and burgers are flavorful. Owners are super friendly and helpful. Definitely one of the best burger places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place looks cool so I decides to eat some lunch. The guy behind the counter is friendly and wants to do nothin but tell me all about the burgers. I'm curious about a spicy burger.... Now at some point I could have sworn I heard him say: \"lava burger is hot, the blazing is kinda hot\" 

I thinks to myself \"well, I don't want 'kinda' hot...I want something to warm me up on this particularly cold day in December\"

Give me the lava burger. 

Without hesitation him and his homeboy in the back get cooking!  While one grills up a storm behind the counter, the other guy casually come around and drops off a bottle of Tabasco Sauce...\"am I gunna need this? I hope not\"
When the burger is served, I chow down! It was a pretty big burger but I noticed it didn't have much toppings on it but FORGETABOIT this burger is good. The dude behind the counter is all laughing and having a great time! \"WTF is this guy laughing about?? Next thing I know my eyes start gushing out water! My mouth wasn't hot or on fire but it's like something tricked my mind into thinking it was hot! The dude asked me if I want to buy an ice cream shake...I was tempted... but every bite I took was so good! So I just powered through and ate the whole thing! TAKE THAT! The guy gave me a bunch of mints for finishing it and I left with my face looking like I dumped on prom night. 

10/10 WILL EAT THERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Just had the Cordon Blue special...AWESOME! 
Really friendly  service and the deck was a great place to chill with my lunch chow!"}
{"text":"I very much appreciate their vegetarian options, but wish they had more varieties of vegetarian burgers.  The quality was quite good, and I very much liked the \"build your own burger\" options.  The atmosphere was a bit like a hectic lunch place, which was appropriate for a quick workday lunch.  I wouldn't recommend it for a fine dining experience.  The food was tasty and owner, who also served as the cashier, was very friendly and accommodating.  Two thumbs up for a somewhat unique locally owned place with veggie options!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, very fresh. They have a lot more than just burgers, and the price is really good too. The owner is super friendly and even gave us some samples of some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I got the caremelized onions and blue cheese. It was soooooo good.

I've been eating healthy for the last 5 months and have been sad because I couldn't find  a place to eat that serves burgers.  Then this place came along and made all my dreams come true. I had an awesome burger and walked away still feeling great.

The decor is nice and clean. It doesn't have rock and roll posters on the wall but what the heck does that have to do with awesome burgers, Besides, who wants sensory overload while they're enjoying a burger. The only sensory overload I need is the one that was going on with my taste buds.

This is a local place and I'm more than happy to support it. The foods delicious so why not. The family that works there is really cool and friendly too.

I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to get a good burger."}
{"text":"Awesome experience.... my youngest son had an accident while hiking and was getting stitched up at the hospital around the corner. It was past lunch time and my older son and I were starving but also had our dog. Found Jimmy G's on yelp and with a coupon decided to give it a try.

Upon arriving it was the perfect casual spot to hang out and kill time with the dog. Nice porch with picnic tables to eat at which were perfect for a messy 3 yr old and pup. Ford was excellent burgers were juicy and fries hot and crispy. Only food that wasn't great was a Togo Greek salad I got for my wife (not nearly enough dressing).

What really earned this place 5 stars though was the service, the gentleman I'm assuming was the owner or at least manager was tremendous. He didn't know our situation but was interactive with my 3 yr old and enticed him to finish his burger with free ice cream (it worked). The nice lady working also brought a bowl of water for our dog.

Big thanks to Jimmy G's for assisting us on a tough day with good food and hospitality. If I ever find myself back in that neighborhood I will defiantly be stopping."}
{"text":"Ask Jimmy to make your burger spicy .... It's AWESOME!!!  Food and service is the best we experienced in Phoenix (and we tried all the big name restaurants)."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here after seeing the good reviews but was disappointed. I got the patty melt and it was nothing special. I felt I could have made something reasonably equivalent at home. Maybe I should have gotten a burger with a bun but still, on a patty melt i would expect thicker slices of sandwich bread than what they serve. Fries were slightly undercooked and didn't taste really fresh."}
{"text":"Bought a living social deal...very pleased.  I plan to come again.  The green leaf lettuce isn't my favorite on burgers...wilts. Otherwise great!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here AGAIN! Wonderful peanut butter bacon burger, would definitely order it again! Best burgers so far BBQ bacon and peanut butter bacon. I have tried the bleu cheese but it's a little strong for me! Definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"Tried the burgers. Well cooked and tasty. Habanero burger is extremely hot only try if you're brave enough. Really friendly staff."}
{"text":"oh , very strange because I was there today and I ordered gyro lamb,it was fantastic. and fries were very frish and really I couldn't finish my meal cause it was a lot . The thing which I like the stuff was very friendly and even they gave me to test the new dishes. I love it so much. I will go again sure."}
{"text":"Sad to see this restaurant closed, apparently being repainted and turning into another restaurant. I enjoyed the excellent food here and the owner and his wife were always welcoming and wonderful. Thank you Jimmie G'S for introducing me to peanut butter on a cheeseburger and for the delicious shwarma."}
{"text":"This place was delicious under the real Jimmy G. Now that the ownership changed, the burgers are not good. The buns are way worse, the originally delicious peanut butter burger is horrible (no bacon, way too much peanut butter and terrible patty) and the menu has weird non-burger things. When they changed the way they make their burgers and expanded to things that don't belong at burger places, they should have changed their name."}
{"text":"Absolutely a five star quality restaurant. It's not a Ruth's steakhouse or extravagant dining, it is a phenomenal little burger shop. They do more then burgers too. Stop by grab a lava burger (if you can handle the heat) and then try the shawarma wrap. 

I'll be back, especially if the owner is always this welcoming."}
{"text":"The owner and his wife were very welcoming.  I had a classic burger.  It was one of the best burgers I've had.  The beef was well seasoned and very tasty.  The fries were great too.  They were well seasoned and crispy.  I would eat there again."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their burgers are great and their breakfasts are too!  Today I got the sausage breakfast burrito, with blazing sauce and a side of salsa. So good. Come by for breakfast sometime."}
{"text":"Went in with my work crew, got a southwest burger and was not disappointed. The bun was super soft and the sauce they used was a really nice combo to the beans! The fries are fresh, which is always a plus. They remind me of five guys fries. They have a giant patio which I thoroughly enjoyed! ill be back. They need a dessert!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today... decided to try it since I didn't have a great experience when it was \"Da Burger Shack\". Two things immediately stuck out:
1. The inside looks MUCH better now.. it's cleaner, looks nice, and has more space.
2. The people who work there are extremely nice!

I had a cheeseburger.. the burger had a nice juicy homemade taste served on an amazing bun. My co-worked had \"blazing\" sauce with his that he really enjoyed.

Definitely give this local restaurant a try, especially if you haven't gone back since they turned into \"Jimmy G's\"."}
{"text":"A friend and I made lunch plans for today, she suggested we come here.
So glad we did!

I had the BBQ Bacon Burger, medium rare, with fries. She had the special - Southwest burger, with chorizo.

The bacon was perfect! I should have asked whose bacon they use - this is the stuff I want at home. So meaty and perfect and thick and full of bacony goodness. The cheddar was melted to perfection - with crispy parts where it hit the grill. Few things get me giddy like the crunchy cheese! The onion ring was a happy touch. Burger itself well prepared and flavorful and the bun was super fresh.

The fries were good - but the burgers were large enough that even with the two of us sharing my fries, most were left on the plate.

I'll definitely be back - happy to have this place so close to home!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with some coworkers and had the BBQ Bacon, Lava, and another (Classic?) burgers with fries and onion rings.  All were very tasty!  The menu offers more than just the standard burger fare and has enough variety to make me want to come back to try other things.  Even so, what really sets this place apart is the super friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"Originally, I was going to give Jimmy G's 5 stars.  However, that was under the initial owners.  At that time, Jimmy G's seemed to be one of the few high quality, \"mom and pop\" burger joints in the area.  Unfortunately, the food quality dropped a bit under the new ownership.  Also, Jimmy G's also used to have a large and creative burger selection.  Now it seems like they are trying to move from their burger roots and expand their menu to a larger variety of items.  In my opinion, the best restaurants tend to stick to making a few dishes very well.  Jimmy G's should go back to their original menu and focus primarily  on great burgers.  That being said, the new owners and staff are very friendly, and the service is great.  Hopefully, these changes will made, and Jimmy G's will become the 4-5 star restaurant that it deserves to be."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the burgers we had, WAY TOO over cooked, our fault we didn't say med rare and they were beyond well done!"}
{"text":"I see this place has closed. They always had a sign out that read \"Opened for Breakfast\". But they were never opened for breakfast. I ate there once and had a burger and fries and did not go there again since the food wasn't the greatest."}
{"text":"Great new place in the hood. Several varieties of burgers and all freshly ground beef. No frozen patties here. Fries are also homemade and hand cut. The chili-cheese fries were awesome. Ordered the BBQ bacon cheeseburger which was very moist and tasty.  Only suggestion would be to add beer and wine to the menu.  It would also attract more of a crowd.  Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Great food! I was lookin for something to eat that was close to where I was workin and I found Jimmy G's. Had no idea it was here but very happy I found it though!"}
{"text":"The blazing burger is everything they said it would be, wonderfully hot!  

If coming for lunch, come early becaseu parking is limited unless you don't mind the street.  Nice outside seating and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  Great job Jimmy!"}
{"text":"I tried Jimmy G's today. The burger was definitely house made....I love irregular shaped burgers....I know someone put some effort into making them. The bun was perfect...not steamed or crushed. I ordered ahead but the best part was that they didn't pack it ahead. I saw the cook assemble my burger, wrap it and put it in the bah while I watched. It was hot, fresh and worth the trip. I'm glad to have him in the 'hood."}
{"text":"True story: My wife was in labor for 62 hours. After the first day she managed to walk around a bit and ate a JimmyG cheeseburger with onion rings. She had to go on petocin for the next 2 days and all she had to sustain herself was JimmyGs. Now we have a wonderfull boy! Thank you! She loved the burger. You guys rock"}
{"text":"This place has switched owners about a billion times (ok, maybe only four times) since we moved to this neighborhood three years ago. I guess it's hard to make this place work as a burger joint.

The veggie burger is ok, but even though this place is within walking distance, we'd rather go somewhere else 99% of the time. Last time we went, I had a craving for onion rings...but the ones I got were burnt, which made me sad. I love onion rings! The fries weren't that good either.

The menu seems to be having an identity crisis...there's a lot to choose from, but the food isn't outstanding or notable in any way to me. BUT I have not had their non-veggie food, so maybe for meat eaters, it's amazing--I don't know.

The owner and his wife are really nice (and I mean both the current owner and wife and the previous owner and wife of Jimmy G's) and you always get great service here (which is why this place gets 3 stars). They will even deliver out to your car if you call in your order!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today after hearing my co-workers rave about the place. I was very happy that I went since the food was really good. You can build your own burger out of a very large array of choices. I got the basic bacon cheeseburger with swiss  cheese and was very happy. The burger was cooked to perfection and very juicy and full of taste. The fries were really good too. It is a very good local place and the staff are really warm and friendly. I would highly recommend it for a good tasty lunch. The only reason it didn't rate 5 stars was the fact they don't server fresh brewed tea but rather that tea from a soda fountain. Other than that, everything was great and a great price! :-)"}
{"text":"Great service & outstanding staff - went above and beyond for to provide exceptional customer service. Food is reasonably priced and delicious! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Burgers were excellent (both BBQ bacon cheese and peanut butter bacon) and fries were even better. They cook burgers to order instead of chain-style aka overdone. Staff - I think one was probably the owner - was super friendly. Fun environment. Great shaded tables outside which are perfect this time of year. Very clean. Another win for the local scene!"}
{"text":"I am so happy to have Jimmy G's in my neighborhood!!  I love how the new owners have really cleaned the place up.  It looks GREAT.  I also love the food and prices!!  My favorites are the turkey and veggie burgers.  You can even ask to have you burger protein style, no bread just served on lettuce.  They are so willing to make it the way you like it.  My daughter loves the hambugers and french fries.  Everything they serve is fresh and not frozen.  I HIGHLY recommend trying it out, as I think you will glad that you did."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars because I liked the costumer service! The guy was extra friendly. The burger was one that could have been thrown together at home & did not fit the bun & the fries were only so so the ketchup was running and tasted funny."}
{"text":"Great little place. Very good burgers and people. Very clean and cute, and a perfect patio for spring or fall."}
{"text":"So my girlfriend is flying home from Chicago, foodie capital of the world, and tells me she just had the best burger. Hmmm, I want a burger! So while I'm waiting for her flight to arrive, I head over to Jimmy G's...awesome burgers! Not as good as some I've had in Chicago, but an excellent choice if you're in the area antiquing or thrift store shopping."}
{"text":"I rarely ever feel inclined to write a review, however, my experience here has been so great I just had to share! To begin, the customer service is awesome. The owner is incredibly friendly and is proud of the food he serves. I have tried the gyro wrap and  cheeseburger. This burger is the BEST I have had in a long time. The beef was thick and juicy, cooked perfectly to my liking. The fries are also delicious and are always seasoned well. They have a great patio and if my job permitted a longer lunch break, I would stay and eat. Their service is very fast. I will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Fries are delish ! I had the classic burger and i asked for it with out ketchup, but it came with it anyway. The burger tasted good and it was for sure as fresh as your going to get. It was overloaded with condiments that the burger fell apart and i gave up after two bites. Everyone has there burger preference , but this was not mine. I wont deduct stars because Jimmy's should be given a chance because i can tell there is a whole lot of heart on what they do."}
{"text":"Ok! Good burger places are a dime a dozen but this place rocks! The burgers are fresh ground, hand made, fries are amazing! Had the Swiss mushroom burger and chili cheese fries! Really good! Love the atmosphere, sat on the porch at a picnic table. Tables are also inside.  Great service! We'll be back! Good job Jimmy G's. Live long and prosper!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough nice things about this place.  We were so happy to find it when out for a walk.  Charming spot in the cute little Cheery Lynn neighborhood, but right on 16th so it's easily accessible.  Lots of places to sit outside on the wrap-around porch, as we did.   Just Mrs. G behind the counter taking our order (so friendly and welcoming!) and Jimmy made our food (he was also really nice and asked how we enjoyed our meal).  The food is high quality but very reasonably priced.  We got two burger meals, one specialty burger and one custom, with a side of avo for the babe and it came to $20 even.  I had the Blazing Burger and it was fantastic!  Just spicy enough to keep you wanting more but not overpowering. Enjoyed everything about the food, you can tell the ingredients are quality, from the vegetables to the buns to the huge (properly cooked) meat patty.  Hard to pick a  favorite between the fries (use the special fry-seasoning in the can on the condiment bar, next to the Sriracha (another win)) and the onion strings!  I like their apparent philosophy.  Keep it simple, keep it quality. Very much want to come back and try breakfast, and wish they were open for dinner!  Looking forward to returning.  Thanks Jimmy G's!  Way to be."}
