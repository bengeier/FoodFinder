{"text":"Came here with friends for Winterlicious (thank god or I would be way more upset). To keep it simple- not worth the visit at all. The food was meh. As a group of mostly Italians we were all quite disappointed with the pasta as it tasted like canned sauce. They ran out of a few things on the Winterlicious menu even though we were the only people in the restaurant eating at the point and it didn't seem to be busy when we got there. Also on that note, the service was quite slow. Some of our apps came out with our mains and the table space was definitely not big enough. We waited a good half hour for our bill- had to ask for it 3 times. By the time we left we still had dirty plates in front of us (huge pet peeve). The owner/manager was at the bar drinking and talking to people the whole night and not once did he come by and check in (restaurant is very small and only 5 of the 8-10 tables were occupied). It was quite obvious we were disappointed but he was no help. Our server was friendly and apologetic, I will give her that much, but overall for a 'nicer' restaurant in Yorkville we expected a lot more. Oh also, the bathrooms are disgusting. Co-ed and not clean at all. One of our guests had difficulty finishing her food after going in there.  Overall, I wouldn't suggest going here even during Winterlicious or with a Groupon."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Great music, service ... Delicious food. Too bad no one knows about this place, hidden gem"}
{"text":"Not family friendly :(  Booked a reservation for a birthday party and notified them that I would be bringing a baby. Over the phone they assured me that it wouldn't be a problem and that they would give me a table as far from the live music as possible.   When we got there the table was right in front of the amplifier and under the main speaker. The nice waitress offered to move me 2 tables away from the speakers but before we could sit down the music person started yelling at me for bringing a baby. Yes YELLING at me for bringing a baby. He did later apologize for \"jumping\" on me but it was too late. Very uncomfortable and it just not the way someone wants to start a $300-$400 dinner party on a Friday night. We left and are now eating dinner with sangria at family friendly Ciao restaurant down the street. Yum!!"}
{"text":"The bar was half-empty at Friday night, but we waited one and half hour for our food. Doesn't worth it.   Not going there again."}
{"text":"Saw this deal on Groupon for this place so thought I would check it out. Went in a Wednesday night and they had a girl playing the piano which I liked but that's all I liked.   Atmosphere was nice but I was offset by the fact the kitchen was right there in the same room. Chef was one guy cooking off an ancient looking four element stove.  My clothes and jacket smelled of food after leaving.   Food was really disappointing. The pasta tasted like something I could have made at home.  Prices are way too high. I would be more upset if I didn't have a Groupon."}
{"text":"Not worth the price of the voucher!  The concept is good, but very poorly executed.   My husband and I went there tonight, with the Groupon, and we walked out before we got our main courses. Our experience to that point, made it clear that it wasn't worth staying. 1) the place was freezing 2) we were seated under a speaker, the pianist/singer was horrible and we couldn't hear ourselves think. We asked if they could turn down the speaker a bit, the server agreed it was too loud. She tried to turn down the speaker, but couldn't. 3) the place was packed, and they keep adding more seats to places where clearly there shouldn't have been seats, so people were sitting within an inch of us.   3) we ordered calamari that was clearly frozen and served with seafood sauce from the jar. 4) we ordered an additional appetizer, the caprese salad, which was a few slices of unripened tomatoes with some bocancini  cheese. The fresh basil and good quality olive oil were MIA. 5) with only 1 person serving, and 1 chef with no assistant, The service was sporadic at best.  Between the overcrowding, being unable to hear and lousy food, we decided to cut our losses on the voucher and leave before we got our mains. We weren't enjoying anything, so there was no point in staying.  We walked over to Dimmi on Cumberland and had some phenomenal fresh pasta. We were able to talk, had no one on top of us, and great service."}
{"text":"Just got home from this restaurant/bar with my boyfriend and our experience was not at all pleasant.  First of all, the air smells quite fishy just right after we got in. And then we realized that was probably due to the fact that the kitchen is just right at the end of the bar where everyone can see and smell. Secondly, the service was really slow. It took them 30 minutes to have our appetizer ready. Then another 30 minutes or so to serve the entrees. They didn't serve the two entrees at the same time as well. The food tastes really delicious tho. But the price wasn't pretty. Good thing that we went on a Groupon deal.  Other than the slow service, the server wasn't attentive at all either. He was probably too busy chatting with other people at the bar to notice that we were done with our drinks. It was the owner that came over 15 mins later to ask if we want anything else to drink. We decided to have just water.  Another thing that we didn't enjoy is the music. The lady who was playing the piano and singing was good. But it was too loud thru the speaker and it made it really hard to have a conversation. Somehow it also made me feel very agitated and just wanted to leave.    Finally, after we had our meals, we quickly got the bill and left. We both noticed a strong greasy and smoky smell on our hair and clothes. Obviously it was because of the kitchen. It made the air unbearable inside already and now it is stuck on us.   We will not be going back there again and will not recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"Came with a groupon ($29 for 1 app & 2 entries). We had the antipasto and fondue (chicken, beef and 6 bacon wrapped bacon dipped in boiling oil). The antipasto was average, but the fondue was a disappointment. The meat wasn't that good, beef had lots of tendon. Portion was OK, we left with a hungry stomach... Should have ordered the pasta dishes...  Service was good thou."}
{"text":"Truly one of the worst dinners I have ever been served at a restaurant in my life.  I say all of this with some guilt because our server was very friendly; however, even she could not earn this place an additional star.    I'll start by saying that it's been two days since we went, and I am finally able to eat and drink other foods since battling the food poisoning that I'm 95% sure I got from this place.  So here's a run down of how it all went: 1) Very hard to make a reservation - messages are left, but you don't get a call back.  If you're lucky enough to have someone answer, it may not mean you actually have your name written down.   2) Music is super loud - tough to have a conversation 3) Wine was $55 a bottle for a bottle that is $8.95 at the LCBO  4) Bacon wrapped scallops look and taste like they are the presidents choice ones that come frozen.  For a frozen product, they aren't half-bad, but definitely small and underwhelming for a restaurant. 5) Penna a la vodka was just meh - don't have much to say about it. 6) Chicken skewers were the real kicker - first of all they were about 8 small flat pieces of chicken that were WAY over cooked in their oven. Barely seasoned.  Comes with 3 dipping sauces, all of which appear to be store bought.  The salad (one of those grocery store clam shells) was covered in a copious amount of dressing.  Grilled vegetables were 4 pieces of red pepper that looked to be maybe slightly steamed??  Overall, if you can get your money back on the groupon you already purchased, do so.  If you don't have a groupon and are planning to eat at this place, you are out of your mind.  I truly believe that any of the positive comments about the food are by friends of the staff or the staff themselves.  The food was on par with a microwavable dinner at best. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"What a shit place!! DO NOT EVER go here! Service is terrible and the food was ridiculously disgusting!! My husband had the Alfredo and it was tasteless and the fettuccine was undercooked he was ready to walk out of the place.. I had the chicken skewers which was bland, tasteless, dry, yuck!! The 'kitchen' is at the side of the bar and is no way big enough for the food to be freshly prepared.. It's all store bought packaged stuff and I could have made better myself!  We ordered wine and food at the same time. We waited and waited for our drinks until our waitress walked by and stopped near our table because she realised she forgot about them! People who came in after us were getting served before us for both food and drinks. We got the drinks eventually and continued to wait for our food which wasn't worth the wait at all. Like someone else said the waitress just dropped the bill on the table and walked on by and never spoke. No one asked us how anything was but I suppose they know not to cos they know what the serve is crap!  On our bill they added on 2x $5 for the 'privilege' of listing to the piano man. This was very very sneaky of them and we refused to pay it as it was not stated anywhere there was a 'cover charge' and they took it off the bill thankfully. Will never enter this establishment again and I advise everyone else not to!  I should have read the reviews before entering this place!  Terrible terrible terrible!"}
{"text":"Ignore the bad reviews for this place....my friend and I dined here last night. I almost tried cancelling my groupon because of the negative reviews..but I guess you can say I read through them as not being completely worthy of such negativity. It is a small restaurant with limited seating..so I can see the chances of a reservation not accommodated to the minute happening. Also that means some seats will be close to the entertainment. It was not overly loud that you couldn't hear yourselves talk. Our 2 pasta dishes were very good. And so were our appetizers...bacon scallops and mushroom bruscheta. The staff was very helpful, pleasent,efficient and attentive. The atmosphere is comfy/romantic.  The prices are very reasonable even if you didn't have any discounts.  Errol Fisher, singing jazz was fantastic!  We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Had the cheese platter and the fondue and it was all delicious!  Our server was very sweet and friendly and the pianist was lovely. Overall a great dinner out!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst!!! Never coming back!! Only good thing about this place is the music."}
{"text":"This piano bar is filled with friendly staff and an amazing atmosphere. Very recommended for every couple that wants to have a romantic night out!"}
{"text":"Went on a Groupon (1 appetizer and 2 entrees).  My husband and I had the scallops wrapped in bacon, the antipasto platter and the fondue.  I feel that all three were more generous portions than we'd have gotten elsewhere for that price (regardless of the Groupon).  The service was excellent, prompt, attentive.  The music was lovely!  Had to ask how to tip the piano lady, they put out a glass just for me to tip her (thank you).  Overall, a very appreciated date night.  I think both my husband and I enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Honestly embarrassing. Ridiculously overpriced for what you get and the quality can be matched at your home in a cinch. There are a slew of places within a stones throw that will at least make you consider going back.   Not coming close to joking when I say do not ever consider going. Steer your friends clear as well.. the owner should be beyond embarrassed."}
{"text":"Overpriced, and not worth it to me. Tried this on a Groupon and still disappointed. Hole in the wall spot should have more charm and the piano player was not what I expected in a piano bar."}
{"text":"We went last night after we got a group on and we were really happy with our meal and service. Great food, our waitress was wonderfully pleasant, the only lacking thing was the music. The pianist had kind of an interesting take on the music but it was too loud and she did an acoustic version of hips don't lie which was a little bit weird. Otherwise great experience! We got the fettuccine, arrabiata and artichoke dip which were all fantastic."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went on a date to this place. Food was ok, the steak skewers were better than the penne a la vodka, we chose the antipasto as appetizer, salty but good. The live music was ok, my only complain would be that they didn't serve us water at all while we were there."}
{"text":"We bought deal from the Groupon- so the price was ok for us. Otherwise I would rate as 1 star. This place does not have a kitchen, you can see the waitresses are cooking the pasta for you while running around to serve people. We both ordered pasta, the pasta was too hard and not cooked well. If I paid for the full price I would be really disappointed. Pricy menu and nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Ehnnnnnn pros and cons. Which first?  Okay, pros. Really cute location, small in an intimate way, and has the amazing offering of live music to serenade you as you eat/converse with your dining companion.  Cons? The food. The prices. And especially the food considering the prices. My friend and I had bacon wrapped scallops, chicken skewers, the alfredo pasta, and the artichoke dip. Nothing was particularly outstanding - the skewers were particularly unimpressive, and brought us to philosophize about the significance of the (broken-by-hand-to-fit-on-plate) skewer sticks, when clearly the chicken was cooked (until dry) without. The alfredo pasta was aight, and the artichoke dip was okay. Drinks are also priced for Yorkville: $16 cocktails, $10 glasses of wine, and $8-9 bottles. This would be more acceptable if they at least chose some gourmet stuff, but it's all completely standard.  BUUUT let's not forget the live music, shall we? Overall, realistically, I won't ever be back for dinner - but I might very well come back on a for some late evening dip and/or an overpriced drink which I will write off as cover for the musical accompaniment on Fridays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"To sum it up... not impressed.  I went on a groupon deal (and I honestly feel bad for non-groupon customers).  I'm going to rate this establishment the way Four Weddings work...   Overall Experience:  1 (thank god it was a Groupon) the good: -food was great -crystal chandeliers -location the bad: -the space is freezing cold -food is cooked right in the corner of the room, visible for all to see -manager/owner/whatever was not professional.  Upon leaving, he did not thank us for the business or remind us of items that we left behind that were in clear visible view of where he was standing -boring atmosphere due to lack of customers -promo standee was placed against the door way, unable to open door -the smallest portions ever for what your paying -a CD with 5 songs kept playing over and over and over and over and over and over again  Interior: 1    (1 out of 10 for the 3 chandeliers above the bar, lovely touch) 1980's glamour, Sinatra is there to greet you as you come and go  Food:  7.5  Chef did an amazing job with what he has to work with, A+ for him"}
{"text":"Would not recommend this place under any circumstances. By far the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. My boyfriend and I went there for our 2 year anniversary. We booked a reservation well in advance, yet despite this we ended up waiting 20 minutes for a table as they were unprepared. There was also supposed to be live music, that was the whole reason we chose this place. They only had music playing from the laptop on the bar.   We then waited almost half an hour for service. I am not exaggerating when I say it was nearly 30 minutes before we were spoken to. We ordered sweet potato fries as an appetizer, and pastas for our main dishes. Our drinks arrived after almost 10 minutes and we continues to wait for the food.  ANOTHER 20 MINUTES after our drinks were brought the waitress comes up to is and tells us they are out of sweet potato fries. 30 MINUTES AFTER WE ORDERED THEM. My boyfriend and I were quite unhappy at this point and asked for a ceaser salad instead of the fries.   Here's the really great about about the evening. After we had eaten  the salad and received our main dishes, I look over to the bar and see the waitresses and bartender eating. Guess what they were having... That's right! SWEET POTATO FRIES.   Then later on the staff proceeded to sit behind the bar and drink their own alcohol. My boyfriend and I work in restaurants and this is very illegal. I have never had a worse night out in my life."}
{"text":"I was an out of town visitor and had bought the groupon for 2 glasses of wine, 1 appetizer, and 2 entrees. The food was delicious, service was great, and the atmosphere is cozy. Would recommend to anyone to definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"I do not know why this place is getting a bad rap! Went to this restaurant because there was a great Groupon, and I am so glad we did! We had the artichoke dip with pita and fettuccine alfredo and I was quite pleased with my meal. The service was spectacular and the ambiance was lovely."}
{"text":"Appetizers and dinner were delicious! The cheese board, calamari and bacon wrapped scallops were amazing. Perfect location right in Yorkville. Live music was wonderful too!"}
{"text":"This bar is closed. There is a note on the front door, they did not pay the rent to the landlord. The website is down too. http://www.salutepianobar.com Sounds quite fishy (no pun intended)."}
{"text":"Less than adequate... especially for Yorkville. Trying hard and failing on all levels. From the makeshift \"assembly\" kitchen of one burner and a hot pot to the dull and disinterested service, we were not impressed. It was basically a crappy meal (we both had the Spaghetti Bolognese with Kobe beef) which was no more than jarred sauce with ground beef on noodles. The least expensive bottle of wine was $65 (other great restaurants in the area still offer great selection at a more reasonable price point). Then there's the owner?, who sits and stares at you and the staff without ever lifting a finger or chatting with anyone. Why can't he see what I see? Those glasses need washing and your only waitress could use a hand. Common man! And where was the piano player at Saluté Piano Bar??? I won't yammer on, but I give this place 8 months before the charade is up unless things change considerably! I promise not to return."}
{"text":"Came here twice with my boyfriend for date night. I think what I love about Salute is its convenient location in the centre of Yorkville. This restaurant offers live music on some nights (although we haven't had the chance to experience it on either of those nights).   The place is cute! It's very elegant and perfect for a girl's night out or a date night. The food is terrible though... Dishes I've tried: - The oyster appetizer ( a dozen Raw oysters with lemon): tiniest oysters I have ever seen in my entire life, were not plentiful nor juicy  - The Premium cheese platter - This I loved with a glass of wine... However , not worth the price of 19$ as the crackers served are the $2 box ones from the grocery stores.  - Chicken, steak and seafood fondue - Literally dipping those items into bowling oil. The idea may seem interesting, but a regretful eat indeed  - Chicken/ Beef Skewers - were yummy, but nothing out of the ordinary. Tasted like any kind of skewers I could get from the food court   So if you're shopping around Yorkville, tired from a day of shopping, and want a place for drinks and to rest your legs, definitely check out Salute. But for dinner, there are other great places in the area for the same price range that offer far better quality of foods."}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night. My friends and I wanted to try a new Yorkville spot. We heard some music coming in from this joint, so we figure we give it a shot.  We get a table in front of the stage. In essence our faces were basically 5 feet from a saxophone. You can't chill and have a conversation in this place when there is live music. We glanced at the menu and weren't impressed.  We got up and said Salut to Salute Piano bar and left."}
{"text":"Been here on 2 occasions, and experience has always been pleasant. Good food, good music, good music... I don't know if it's just me, but there was a strange odour when I visited the last time. :/ Also, if you're driving, parking can be expensive."}
{"text":"Got a groupon for the 1 app and 2 entree for $14. Seems like a real good value. Yet the waitress told us they can't make this, can't make that, oh that we can't make either. It turns out they can't make any of the more expensive things on the menu. They should have just be honest and state on the groupon what things it would apply to. The food is meh, the chicken skewer is really not good, too dry. The spaghetti is soso, I can make similar ones. The ambience is nice but the place is cramped. There is no proper kitchen and it smells."}
{"text":"Goods: The place is very nice in terms of the design and atmosphere.  We went on a Wednesday night, they had a live pianist playing until 9pm.   Bads: We made a reservation by calling multiple times but the phone is never answered. I made a reservation online and received a confirmation email but when we got there they did not have our reservation. There were a couple of tables come in after us which made reservations and had to wait over 20mins for their table.  There was only 1 chef, 1 server and 1 bartender working, thus only the server was running around serving and delivering food. Service was super slow!  We ordered cheese board and oil based fondue. The fondue was terrible, only 3 pieces of chicken, beef, shrimp each which charged $35. Food wasn't seasoned at all and wasn't fresh, you can see the beef partly brown. There were no sauce to dip the food in either. Since it's oil based, it was basically deep frying food.   We were definitely not full from the fondue but didn't want to order anything else .  As we got our bill, the server just dropped it off and walked away. I saw her walk behind the bar and started going on her phone. If we walked out and didn't pay, she definitely wouldn't notice.  I would never go back and never recommend anyone to go."}
{"text":"Guitar in a piano bar, interesting idea. Young man, playing his heart out, long sets,  strumming, no finger work, relies on his voice & good looks.pleasant for an evening."}
{"text":"excellent service amazing food i will recommend them  i spend good time i was there with friends"}
{"text":"Bought a deal on groupon. The food was great! This place is small but cozy.  They charge $5 per person for the live music but it is ok because the performer was great!"}
{"text":"Quaint little establishment along the trendy streets of Yorkville. Amazing food, courtesy & friendly staff and beautiful decor...you can't go wrong with that combination. I had the Fettuccine al frutti de mare and my sister had tilapia. Both dishes were seasoned well. The tilapia was seared to perfection.   And a piano bar wouldn't be complete without music! Supplied by a talented songbird.  The food, music, wine and music created for a lovely ambiance altogether.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went there last week with a couple friends from the area and had an amazing time...Drinks, a little dancing and some Karaoke from some great people. Crowd and atmosphere are very good and relaxed.  You'll have a good time, especially later on at night when they do Karaoke or on Thursdays."}
{"text":"Bf & I decided to come here because it looked like a nice, romantic little place. Perfect for a date night. I had called on a Friday night at 6:00pm and spoke to one of the waitresses to book a reservation for the next day, Saturday at 7:30pm. She said it was available and asked for my name and confirmed my reservation, so everything was going as planned. On the day we arrived, a very rude waitress, the one that greeted us told us there's no reservation and pretty much told us to leave because there are no spots at all. She kept asking if I got an email confirmation because she thought I made the reservation online when I kept telling her I spoke to a LIVE person and made the reservation through the phone. And she thought I was stupid and told me they open at 5pm as if she thought I called earlier than 5pm and was lying. So we left and we will not be returning because of the poor and rude customer service.   They were incompetent and rude. We drove all the way to down town Toronto just to try out the place, only to be told to leave because apparently they were too incompetent to confirm reservations and mark it down.   In my opinion, customer service is really a big factor for success in restaurants and that's one thing they lack.   Maybe one day we'll return if they decide to hire people with better customer service skills."}
{"text":"I had tried this place out during an evening last week on a Groupon with my girlfriend. We had sat down in this humble place with a pianist singing pop songs with a jazzy vibe. The resturant is quite small with 3-4 staff on the floor. 2 of them were dressed in street clothes while the waitress dressed in 'waitress attire'. The kitchen and bar are directly on the floor of the tables for all customers to see. I thought it was odd that the cook had a sweater and jeans while everyone else was dressed for the part. Overall, I enjoyed the environment.  However, when it came to interacting with the waitress - she had been extremely unwelcoming. She had never looked either myself of my girlfriend while she was talking to us and was always distracted. She was not friendly at all. I had shrugged it off in attempt to enjoy the rest of the evening.  We had both ordered pasta which was surprisingly delicious given the bad service we had. I enjoyed the pasta and would recommend everything about it - except for the price. At $20 a place + $16 wines and cocktails your bill adds up!  As we departed, we had called the waitress over to pay our bill. Again, she did not smile and had us feel very un-welcomed. She had simply left the bill for us to pay and did not say goodbye at all. It's unfortunate because this place has so much potential but it's staff is doing it a great disservice."}
{"text":"I went in a Saturday night because of a Groupon deal. Do make a reservation before coming as the restaurant is quite small and better suited for couples or small groups of 4. They charge a $5 cover per person for the entertainment. There is one waitress for the whole restaurant but I did not have any issues with service. I ordered the fettuccini Alfredo and enjoyed it. It wasn't mind blowing food but good for the value and a nice intimate venue. I had a positive experience at this restaurant and would recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here on a 1 appetizer and 2 entree groupon; we ordered an extra appetizer on top of the voucher and they charged us for the more expensive of the two.  We had the bacon wrapped scallops (decent but SO TINY and came with what tasted like a store bought seafood sauce) 6 oysters which were pretty good quality, but whoever shucked them did a terrible job and each one was full of bits of shell... Lastly, we shared the fondue for two.  Fondue was seafood and meat. The \"seafood\" was literally 8 precooked shrimp, likely from a large grocery store shrimp ring. The beef and chicken were good but a bit too salty for me. The table was far too tiny to hold the food and hot oil pot so we were really crammed during the whole meal and trying not to get burned by splashing oil. There were lots of tables and they should have advised us to move to a larger one when we ordered the fondue.  We had two servers, one who wasn't too friendly and one who was much better. We booked the table for 7 to catch the live music but the musician did not show up until 8:30 or so when our meal was almost done.   While the atmosphere was nice, if we hadn't been on a groupon, our food and drinks would have cost well over $120... And the quality just wasn't worth it. We had a nice night and may try this place again for a drink and some music, but we'll look elsewhere for food from now on."}
{"text":"A nice place but we were the only people in the place at 10pm on a Sat and the servers seemed disinterested in being there.  The piano performer was good.  Don't know what they are doing wrong but we hope business picks up."}
{"text":"Went in there for a quick couple of beers. The bartenders were warm and welcoming. The ambiance was good. Nice place !"}
