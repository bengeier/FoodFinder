{"text":"love their salads only problem is they are only open till 3 and I don't get home until 5. plus they aren't open saturdays or sundays so I never get the chance to go"}
{"text":"When you want a healthy choice that is quick to get u one your way this place is good. It's like a subway but for salads.  Sometimes I like to make my own and sometimes I like to just order a salad from the menu.  My last visit I got the strawberry spinach salad but with chicken instead of salmon.  It was good.  The only downside to me is the grilled chicken is definitely precooked and sometimes just seems very dry.   I have also gotten the buffalo chicken (Crispy) as a wrap and that was very good along with their pizza.  So when I am on the go and I definitely don't want any regular fast food places this is a wonderful option in the Irwin area."}
{"text":"We stopped here during shopping and browsing for last minute gifts in downtown Irwin.  My sister and I have been wanting to visit but since they specialize in BYO salads, we were always overruled by our guys who aren't as excited for salad as we are! :)  The bistro is small but very modern and ample seating, making use of every inch of space.  They also have a spacious clean restroom for customers.  In addition to the Coke fountain, there is also a refrigerator with bottled drinks in case you're on the go.  They have a large menu on the wall in addition to the Specials board that displayed a few sandwiches (grilled cheese type sandwiches and tuna or chicken salad on a croissant), 2 soups available, and a special salad.  We decided to sample a few different things so we got a 'It's a Burgh Thing' grilled chicken salad, an 8\" Boss (Italian) hoagie, and a Simple 6cut cheese pizza. We ordered at the counter and then the food was brought out to us.  Since we were splitting everything between the three of us, they cut the hoagie into 3 pieces, which was a very nice touch of customer service. The hoagie was delicious and had a good amount of meats, cheese, lettuce and tomato, and a delicious Italian dressing that tasted homemade to me.   They also gave us tongs with our salad so we could dish it out. The salad was a lettuce mix with grilled chicken strips, shredded cheddar cheese, diced eggs, cut up French fries, tomatoes, and cucumbers, and they tossed it up with ranch dressing. It was evenly tossed up and a good amount of dressing, not too much! It was delicious and the quality of the ingredients was right on track.  The salad appeared a little bit small initially but just as the woman said it was large, it just kept on giving! The three of us each had 2 servings of salad and there was still some left over at the end!  The (thin crust) pizza was very delicious! The sauce was a robust tomato sauce and not too sweet. There was just the right amount of cheese on the pizza and it was nicely browned.  It was crispy on the outer edge of the crust but the pizza itself was chewy goodness.   We will definitely be back, not only for the excellent, affordable food, but for the stellar customer service!"}
{"text":"The hubs and I stopped in here one evening for a quick bite to eat. For those of you familiar with downtown Irwin, this used to be Romano's, then it was another restaurant for a short period of time. upon entering, you can tell there has definitely been some remodeling - new floors and paint, and there is even more of an open concept to the kitchen. However, I did notice that the tables looked familiar and I believe they were the same ugly pink ones that Romano's had. So, the concept is simple - they sell salads, pizzas, and wraps. Note the \"Iceburgh\" in Iceburgh's Bistro - a cartoon penguin with glasses is the mascot. I'm guessing not only a play on the 'burgh but also the Pens mascot??   There are a select few 'signature' items, but other than that, it is basically a create your own type of deal. Again, if you are familiar with Irwin, it is a very similar concept to DO (pronounced \"dough\") which is across the street and sells create your own pizza, sandwiches, and salads. If you are not familiar with the Irwin area, the set up is kind of Subway-ish.   We were greeted by a friendly woman (owner or co-owner?), who explained the concept to us, and we both decided to get a create your own salad. Base price is $6.95, not bad at all. You can add a protein - chicken , shrimp, salmon, or avocado for an up-charge. I went with shrimp, which is approximately a 3-4 oz portion, for $3.50. You choose everything, starting with the lettuce (mixed greens, iceburg, etc.) and then add your toppings. An employee adds the ingredients to your salad as you move down the line (like I said, Subway-ish). Topping options are plentiful - not just your standard veggies. Examples: corn, black beans, carrots, mushrooms, olives, peas, several different types of cheeses, bacon, pepperoni, eggs, croutons, onions, chickpeas, sunflower seeds, tortilla strips. I also counted 14 different types of dressing.   Pros: Salad was good and very big. There is a cooler with drinks, but they also provide water free of charge. There is still indoor and outdoor seating, like there was when it was Romano's. Staff were friendly. The lady who initially greeted us stopped over and asked how everything was and took our garbage. (Everything is served in / with disposable bowls, silverware, etc.) There was also music playing, not too loudly.   Cons: I would love to see some booths or more comfortable seating. Also, although the concept is a good one, I've seen it before. But - sort of a pro - it is cheaper here. Also, although the salad was very big and you definitely get your money's worth, it comes in a weird shaped bowl, which is kind of taller than it is wide, which makes it hard to eat out of. Lastly, I did see someone pulling chicken patties out of the oven, which is probably what they consider their 'crispy chicken', so I would probably stay away from that.   Overall, not a bad place to grab a quick bit. I would stop in again if I was in the area. 3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"It's an awesome lunch spot, the salads are huge and the sandwiches are good. It's a very simple and short menu but the food and service are great and what they do serve is well done. They just extended there hours as well so it's a great option for a light dinner l."}
