{"text":"Good food, fresh ingredients and friendly service. Worth going to if you're tired of the same old fast food burger places in Markham."}
{"text":"This place is nice! Probably one of the best burrito spots in Markham. Although this is small thing - I love that I can call in my order in advance!   My fave on the menu is chicken and steak!"}
{"text":"Great burrito place! Really liked the fries supreme. Will definitely be back even though its a bit of a drive from my house."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak burrito, it was decent. Lacked a little bit of tang and despite getting the burrito sauce, it wasn't spicy at all. Otherwise it was good enough. Not Burrito Boyz, not even Fat Bastard. More in the vein of Bar Burrito. Satisfactory when in the suburbs."}
{"text":"Flavourful, heavy, and filling! Comparable to burritos in Texas. The fries are also good."}
{"text":"Yes!!!! If you want a football sized burrito this is the place to go. It's made fresh right in front of you. It's a hefty meal but the price tag is decent. The service is great - and guess what!? You don't pay extra for guac... bonus!!   I wish I had taken some pictures as it really is a ginormous burrito that even I was surprised I was able to finish.  Edit: I went back and took pics"}
{"text":"Nachos were horrible almost stale tasting. Burrito I had earlier this year was very good however. So this is just going on the nacho review. I'm hoping the tacos are as good as the burritos."}
{"text":"Neat little burrito spot on Main St Markham. Food was tasty with lots of options for burrito fillings and guac is included! I got the large chicken/beef burrito ($9.82), I don't think it was that much bigger than the small but it was worth it - definitely satisfied my burrito craving!   The place has a simple setting with limited seating. Food took a bit long to prepare but service was friendly. Wouldn't mind revisiting for another burrito!"}
{"text":"Horrible service waited to have my order taken when the order taker taking my order, the boss lady told me the line start that way.  There are no sign where line start,the staff is uneducated poorly. Train , my friend who order took for ever, food over price for it size"}
{"text":"A brightly lit, clean little spot along Main Street Markham.  There is street parking all along Main Street but can be hard to find a spot during weekends.  Here you order first and pay later - had a little miscommunication where we were never told this, and while waiting for someone at the cash register to take our order, other people stepped in front and placed an order.  The staff, clearly aware that we were there first, didn't see anything out of the ordinary and continued to let a few more people order ahead of us.  A minor misunderstanding but feel like the staff can be a little bit more attentive even if it's a fast food place.  Other than that, ingredients (lettuce, tomatoes, onions) were fresh but the taco itself needed to be heated more.  Though you could obviously request more sauce, I felt the default amount of sauce was too little and the whole buritto felt a bit dry."}
{"text":"Very good fries as they are crispy.  Fresh ingredients and consider good value. Would be better if they can heated up so the ingredients can melt into it and taste better.  Comparing with burrito boyz I would prefer to go there instead because I think they taste better and bigger portion.  This place is still good if u are around the area and crave for burritos. Also they have friendly customer service with smiles :)"}
{"text":"Very clean, efficient and friendly staff.  Buritto was awesome and good value for the money"}
{"text":"Easily my FAVE burrito place in Markham !! I love that their menu has a huge variety of options.  I always go for the shrimp bowl - the shrimps are juicy and delicious! My boyfriend had the steak and shrimp burrito and he loved it as well.  The toppings are fresh AND you don't have to pay extra for GUAC (YAY!). We've also tried the fries supreme and the portion was pretty big for the price.  The only downside is that they are a bit stingy with their toppings but don't be afraid to ask for extras!"}
{"text":"Markham has needed a decent burrito place and this is it!   I was very happy with their vegetarian options. Today i had a yam burrito and the other day i had one with soy & beans.  Wonderful!  And no extra charge for guacamole, which seems to be common at other places.  My family raved about the chicken burritos and spicy steak burritos.  Staff is nice and service is fast enough since the food is made to order in front of you.  I'll be back often!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. The people there are friendly and remember you. I've had their chicken burrito and steak burrito bowl. I think I prefer the burrito bowl but both were delicious. Both were very filling and fresh. Great place."}
{"text":"I went here with my sister on a Saturday night to grab dinner. I got a yam burrito and she got a bean and cheese burrito. All the typical toppings were available and everything looked fresh when we were assembling our burritos. Guac is free, so I'd recommend adding it ! :) The yam burrito was ok but personally I like Fat Bastard's better, their yams are more well cooked compared to GNG. The bean and cheese burrito on the other hand was amazing, they add extra cheese compared to a regular burrito so it was cheesy and the fresh ingredients cut from the heaviness. Definitely getting that one if I go back.   Price is typical burrito pricing; two small burritos and a water cost us around $17.   Side note: I don't know why hot sauce at burrito places are always so much hotter than hot sauces available everywhere else. Every restaurant should have burrito grade hot sauce."}
{"text":"Huge plus - guacamole is included in the price of the burritos! I always get a steak burrito here, but I can't give it 5 stars because it still doesn't compare to the Chipotle burritos. Still a solid burrito though!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection of burritos, tacos, quesadillas, and salad bowls! My go to for casual \"Mexican\" food! The meat fillings are always made fresh and seasoned well, whike there are a variety of fresh vegitable options. They offer both white and whole grain tortillas, in a small and large. The size is definitely reflective of what you pay for; the up cost for a large burrito definitely comes with much more meat filling and veggies.  Most importantly, guacamole in burritos and quesadilla is free of charge!!!"}
{"text":"There aren't many burrito takeout restaurants in Markham so I was really excited to see one open up nearby. I wasn't in love with the food I ordered but it is good enough to return to fill my burrito craving without driving too far.   Portions are generous and they don't skimp on toppings. The owners are very friendly as well.  I'm disappointed that the salsa didn't taste homemade or fresh (it may have been but to me it tasted like bottled salsa).   They didn't have crunchy taco shells on the menu when I went but was told they would be introducing it in the future.  I tried the soy burrito, fries supreme (cheese, sour cream, beef and vegetables) and soft chicken tacos.   If I'm in the mood for a vegetarian option, I will definitely skip the soy burrito next time and order the beans and cheese instead. The soy burrito filling was processed mock meat with unusual seasonings.   My husband enjoyed his chicken soft shell tacos.  This restaurant is comparable to mucho burrito / chipotle. I will definitely be back but it isn't my favorite spot for takout mexican food. Hopefully next time will be better!"}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch.   A great place in Markham for a burrito.  Me and the wife shared a chicken quesadilla and a halibut burrito.     Quesadilla came out first(was hungry so sorry no picture), flavour was delicious and toppings were very fresh.   I like their cream sauce and the hot sauce has a nice kick.  Temperature is what really got me.  Their timing is on point, the shell was nicely crisp and cheese and meat was perfect.  Next came the halibut, this only comes in large, but makes sense if they using a whole piece of fish.    You get a lot of fish in this.    The fish was quite good and I will probably go back for that again.     There are other items I would like to try on the menu, and they serve mexican soda (jurridos) which are quite nice as well.  I look forward to coming back again.    Staff is really good at this place.  Very helpful and friendly guys working there."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place and i am so happy i found it.  This place was very easy to find having it right on Main St Markham and with plenty of free parking either on the road or in the back. Upon walking in, the first thing i noticed was how clean and spacious it was and all the fresh vegetables in the display. One of the owners served us and was a very nice guy, kind of quite, but nice nonetheless. He also had no trouble making our orders. The burritos were pretty big in my opinion considering we got smalls. I ordered a burrito bowl and although they do not serve it on a tortilla shell or anything, their portion was pretty big. And they did not skimp out on the toppings like some places do. BONUS: they do not make you pay $1 for guac if you wish to have it.  Their chicken was flavoured well and not dry. the portion given was also enough to spread out and have a bit of everything in every bite. Another added bonus that i personally liked was the fact that their beans were mashed into a paste but still had some bits in it versus having to choose from black beans or pinto beans at most burrito places. i also tried their supreme fries. SO GOOD. they made them fresh and also did not skimp out on the toppings. i would also like to add, when i say they don't skimp out on toppings and ingredients, i don't mean they load the thing up so it's drenched in it. it was just....perfect. yup, perfection. i'm so happy i discovered this place. it is now my go-to burrito joint in this area. yum!"}
{"text":"Great quick meal stop with the option to make it your own way.    Engaged culinary staff and whole foods have been fresh and appetizing both visits I've made.   Was hoping for more options on Main Street.      This isn't your average low end meat options which make the burritos so good.   Tried the nachos on my last visit and very good."}
{"text":"Portions and flavour options are amazing. Pricing is also reasonable. Will definitely return as it's closer than the nearest burrito boyz"}
{"text":"place is clean. decent price. fresh veggies. fries supreme is yum. yaaaay good tacos/burritos in markham"}
{"text":"I've been to this place plenty of times now with my friends and we always pick this spot to grab a quick burrito. The staff there are always friendly and consistently provide us with quality burritos. I have never had a burrito from here and felt bad afterwards, usually after burritos my stomach hurts, but not from here! Pile on the hot sauce it's amazing!   I will see you guys next week for my weekly burrito fix"}
{"text":"Summary: simple but clean place serves giant portions and pleasantly surprises with fresh and high quality ingredients!  Top Must-Get: steak and chicken burrito, plus mango slices Top Regret: single taco order  What I Got: $25+ for two order of tacos (total four tacos) and one big burrito.  We came here for lunch with a group of coworkers, on one of their recommendations. I was skeptical at first - a large burrito going for $9.82, and a taco for $5.99 seemed steeper than I wanted to pay. But hey, I was hungry and this was a location that came highly recommended...   So of course I ordered two tacos and a burrito.  And that's when I learned that   1) the SMALL burritos here are big, and the BIG burritos here are enormous 2) each order of tacos comes with TWO tacos - there was poor communication here (the one blight on their service) since I think they automatically assume a second taco, as it's $5.99 for one taco, and only $2 for a second. Somehow, they thought I ordered 2x2?  But anyway, it turned out to be delicious, so I can't complain. They actually take a while to cook the steak and chicken that goes in your taco too, which is a nice touch over the microwaved ones. Ground beef chunks were a little big, but the steak was SOLID!  For $1, you can add mango slices to any burrito. These are worth it, because they tasted FRESH! That's how I would describe the rest of the ingredients as well - FRESH.   The tacos are a little smaller, and I think I'd definitely go with a burrito next time.   The spicey sauce has good kick - if you ask for just a little, you'll feel it, but it's a good balance! I can't imagine putting on a lot like some people do.  So basically, yes, it's a little pricey, but you most definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Pretty below average taco burrito joint. The fact they don't even have Pico de Gallo or even know what this, is a problem. The meat all kind of tastes like middle eastern shawarma flavours."}
{"text":"I have tried GNG three times now.  Thank god there is a *good* burrito spot in Markham, finally.  My favourite burrito joint is Burrito Boyz/Burrito Bandidos, so this is what I measure all burritos against.    I like the ground beef option, which is probably not popular.  My husband has tried both chicken and steak and he likes them both.  The formula is identical to Burrito Boyz in that they understand proportion, spreading out the toppings and getting a good grill on the burrito.    Everything is fresh, the staff is consistently welcoming and helpful.  I love that I can order online and pick up without waiting."}
{"text":"It's always exciting when new restaurants open in the area. I was SO happy when the signs went up for this restaurant. Naturally, I went online see if there were other locations and to read some reviews on Yelp. I came across their Toronto location and based on the reviews, I was looking forward to trying their food. I LOVE Mexican food and in Markham everywhere you go there are a lot of Italian & Asian restaurants (which i also love), pubs & fast food, so Get & Go Burrito is a wonderful addition to Main St. Markham! It took a while for them to open their doors, but it was well worth the wait! I have been there 3-4 times now since they've opened their doors. Every time my husband or I have have stopped in for take out, the food, employees & experience have been consistently good. They have a lot of great menu options for burrito's, burrito bowls, tacos, quesadilla's, tacos & supreme fries (which are crazy good!)  They have vegetarian, seafood & meat options with a large variety of toppings for anything you order.  The burrito bar was VERY clean & put together very well with a lot of fresh options for toppings. The burrito's we ordered were filled & pressed perfectly on the flat top giving it the right amount of crisp on the outside while still giving you a soft bite to break into it. It tasted very fresh and didn't give me the feeling of fast food at all.   Here are a few things we've ordered on various visits:  Supreme Fries - INSANELY delicious!  Definitely worth checking out. I've ordered the small & large on different visits. Both are huge portions, piled high with their fresh toppings. I was impressed!  Chicken & Steak Burrito's - We ordered the large on our first visit. There was a great amount of well seasoned meat/chicken vs the veggies and rice we ordered. One of the options they offer for burrito sauces is a super delicious creamy chili lime burrito sauce. I took mine on the side so i could give it a try before committing to having it poured inside. Loved it so much that i get it with every order now when i go back.  We also ordered 2 bottles of Mandarin Jarritos (Mexican soft drink they sell).  Steak, Chicken & Ground Beef Tacos   - Meat is seasoned so well and works so well with their fresh toppings & sauces they offer. Tortilla was soft & not too thick & everything stayed inside - didn't fall apart at all! Each order comes with 2.  The large burrito's are VERY filling, so if you want to load up on supreme fries, soft tacos or grab a quesadilla, I suggest a small or sharing items.   Looking forward to trying their nachos next time - which apparently are only available at their Markham location.  Almost forgot! They are open until 11pm every day except for Sunday's (10pm). Which is great and doesn't only leave me with fast food options after 9:30/10pm when most of the restaurants are closed and i just don't feel like having pub food or a burger.  Now if only they would add Churro's to the menu... :o)"}
{"text":"Great friendly service, the BBQ steak burrito was the bomb best steak burrito I've had."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   The service here was fast and friendly. There were 2 people there making your burrito while somebody else ran the cash register. (When you enter, you actually go up to the two guys who make the burritos to place your order and then you go to the person running the cash register to pay.)  The ingredients were fresh.   You have an option of a white or whole wheat burrito.   The eat-in area was clean. I think it sits around 20 people. Not huge but big enough that you shouldn't have a problem getting a seat if you want to eat inside.   So far I've tried the chicken burrito and the steak burrito. Both were good and I do plan on coming back to try the other burritos and also their quesadillas and tacos."}
{"text":"Its pretty cheap and a nicely proportioned burrito. I come here every time I come into this area for a dentist appointment. The employees are really nice and the burritos are pretty good. I'll keep coming"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Wow, so glad that Markham finally has a great Burrito place. There's so much selection of different proteins you can have (chicken, shrimp, ground beef, steak, halibut etc) and the meat is very nicely seasoned. They aren't at all skimpy on the toppings and the price is great. It is very clean, and close to free parking. I would HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"Burrito here is pretty damn good and I can't complain. The small and large burritos are both good sizes and the supreme fries are amazing. Pricing is perfect too. Go to spot after long day at work."}
{"text":"Speed Read: 1) Good Size Burrito 2) Fresh Ingredient 3) Nice Simple layout, pleasant environment, Friendly Service 4) $10 (all in) Burrito, a little pricey for a take out.  Nice little gems in Main Street Markham (Not Unionville)  For $10, I ordered a mango chicken burrito.  I thought it's a little pricey for a burrito.  What I found is that the burrito is pretty big, definitely enough for 1 person. If you want to share, I suggest you order the large size for a little more money.  All the ingredient are shown thru the glass, everything looks fresh.  The only things that's not made there are the salsa sauce.  I hope they will change that soon.  The taste is great.  I am not an expert in burrito, but I can taste the different ingredient, and the combine taste. The one thing I like very much is that they put the burrito on a grill for a long time.  The wrap is crispy, and it heat up the ingredient inside where the cheese melts and blend with the sauce and other ingredient.    Nice simple (green) layout, spacious and comfortable.  Staff are friendly.."}
{"text":"On my first visit here, I got the chicken burrito. I was being very conservative with fillings since I would be running a marathon this weekend and did not want any issues. I stuck with just chicken and veg in the burrito and it was still very satisfying and fresh. Nicely prepared and the burrito sauce was very tasty.  I will definitely be back to try some of the other things on the menu. Lots of variety. The staff is very friendly and the place is clean. I'm so happy to have a Get & Go in my area. It so hard to find good Mexican food in this town."}
{"text":"FOOD: The food here is really good. The veggie soya burrito and quesadillas are super good and tasty. You get to pick your own toppings and they have fresh toppings! The guac from this place is also really yummy! The hot sauce is actually hot and not like other places!   PLACE: Very clean, many tables and seats, organized, and colourful area!   PRICE: $$"}
{"text":"Finally, someone's gone and opened a burrito place in Markham!  Clean, brightly lit take-out restaurant with limited seating and bright green walls. It was not particularly busy when I dropped by on a Sunday afternoon around 1:30 pm. I ordered a chicken burrito bowl and paid at the till. It wasn't until the cook called out \"Steak!\" a few minutes later that the cashier realized she'd told him the wrong order and tried to ask me to pay the difference for steak. Fortunately, the owner of the restaurant noticed the exchange and told me not to worry since it was their mistake. I do note that they did not ask me if I wanted them to replace the steak with chicken like I'd ordered. I'll chalk this up to inexperience since the cashier seemed unsure of what she was doing.  Toppings are fresh and nicely laid out. All the usual toppings are available and I was pleasantly surprised that there is no extra charge for guacamole. However, they only gave a little teaspoon of guac and it wasn't that great (too much lime, a little brown). Everything else in the bowl was great though - the hot sauce is spicy!  They also order a narrow range of exotic drinks (Jarritos!) and pop for a reasonable price.   I would return if I'm craving burritos since this is probably the only Mexican place in the area and the price point is reasonable.   3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Visited a couple of weeks ago and forgot to write up my review. This place is located on Markham Main street under the new condo building that was just recently constructed. Right when you walk in you are greeted by the cashier or the person cooking. I really loved how it was an open concept kitchen and you can pick and see all the fresh ingredients this place has to offer. Their prices are modest and the best part is that they use the same brand that Costco uses for their fries! In other words, COSTCO FRIES! woohoo!   I ordered the supreme fries with ground beef and the halibut tacos. Took about 10 minutes for them to make. They were generous with the halibut, but sadly the guac was an additional cost. I wasn't sure which sauce would go great with halibut, so the lady making my tacos suggested a sauce and I went for it. Service was really friendly and fast. The food was made fresh. The food tasted amazing. It wasn't too heavy, wasn't too light. Also, the halibut tacos might seem pricey, however, they do offer three tacos instead of the usual two. Their fries are a must try as well.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered a regular sized burrito and a nacho to share.  The burrito was all right.  The ingredients were fresh.  It may not be the best in Markham; it is probably the best at this price point.  Granted if you pay a lot more, you can expect more.  But value for money should get points at a joint, don't you think?  And I could be generous and give 4 stars if I consider, hey, it is located in Markham.  I will skip the nacho next time.  It didn't taste good without the hot sauce, if you get my point.  2 meh stars.  So it averages out to 3 stars"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef and chicken burrito, small ($8.05). It was a good size, enough to fill me up! Ordering was quick and service was good, but the food took a while to come. You can choose between a white or whole wheat burrito and there are various toppings to choose from to put in your burrito.   The interior was a bit strange. There were, I believe 3 or 4 doors, but you could only enter and exit through one. Aside from that, it was bright and clean, with ample seating as people do \"get & go\" with their burritos."}
{"text":"It's difficult to find Mexican food that's not Taco Bell in Markham, so my friends and I were glad to ave stumbled on to this place at Markham Mainstreet. The restaurant is clean, staff is friendly, fresh ingredients and great taste! and easy on the wallet too!"}
{"text":"I ordered online from their website for pick up for lunch today. When my brother got there, they said that we had to call after ordering to confirm our orders. I thought that this is silly, as ordering online is more inconvenient as you have to order and then get on your phone to confirm. Most people like to order online so they can avoid calling the place. They were extremely apologetic and even gave us a 20% discount since my brother had to sit and wait for them to prepare the order. The chicken quesadilla was delicious and I would definitely order it again. My brother's steak burrito was a little dry for his taste. He also thought that the burrito was definitely smaller than the one from Mucho Burrito. Otherwise, he thought the taste was comparable."}
{"text":"I have had Get & Go at their North York location so when I saw the sign for his location I was extremely happy!  Well it has finally opened so I had to gab some takeout. In Markham the burrito choices are slim to none. This place is sent from heaven. We had the Halibut Burrito, Chicken and Steak Burrito, Cheese Quesadilla and an order of Supreme Fries. Everything was extremely fresh and tasted amazing. The halibut was nice and fresh and the burrito was fairly large. The wife had the small chicken and steak and she said it was fresh and delicious. She also said the small was enough she was stuffed after eating it. I'm scared to see what the large size is. The toppings on the burritos were very fresh and they provided plenty of them. No skimping here. The cheese quesadilla was nice and cheesy. Cooked perfectly. Now onto the Supreme Fries. These were crazy good. 1000x better than that \"other\" place. Overall this place hit the spot for our Mexican craving!  Looking forward to many more burritos from Get & Go!"}
{"text":"I ordered a mango chicken burrito bowl. Service was quick and friendly. There was plenty of seating inside but the place was very empty.  Stingy with toppings compared to other burrito places. Toppings were mostly fresh but did not seem like everything was. This could have been because it was during the holiday season. I was not impressed with how the chicken was not hot. It did not seem like it was cooked for long, considering how fast it was made.   Prices are a little high. I prefer Chipotle and Fat Bastard to this place, mostly because of the flavour of the meat and the toppings. Overall, I have mixed feelings. I would probably come back again, maybe to try something different."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at this establishment located on Main St Markham.  Get & Go reminds me of the original Burrito Boyz downtown without the 4am lines.  Lots of options available.  My go-to has always been the halibut and Get & Go Halibut was fantastic.  It was so good I may get one tonight!!!!"}
{"text":"best burrito in markham.. good quality meat  supreme fries is amazing nice staff sauces are perfect.  free wifi and nice place to sit and have your lunch break. regular customer here."}
{"text":"Get & Go indeed! I think I've found my new burrito place in Markham! I had the chicken burrito, while my SO had the ground beef burrito.  The taste was fresh, and I don't think I remember enjoying a burrito like I did from these guys. Maybe I just haven't had one in a while, but dang, it was great! I also love that there is no extra charge for guacamole. I hate when places do that! Prices seem a little on the high side, but they are fair. I'd love to try one of their mixed burritos next time, perhaps steak and shrimp with mango? Yummy.  They have a selection of Jarritos soft drinks, as well as tacos and the like. Definitely a place I'll be returning to very soon!  Even with it being on Main Street, finding parking was not the chore I was worried it'd be. I found a place right on the street and I was able to pop in and get my delicious food.  Friendly staff, clean establishment. This place is ticking all the right boxes! Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Driving along main st., I was pretty excited to see a burrito place here. The greek place next door seemed a little pricey at the moment and so being really hungry, I obviously had to walk in and try it out. The place is clean and brand new and the owners were really nice people. They genuinely want to serve people good food.   I got myself a large burrito (steak), and a large burrito is what I got. As you can see, it has a couple bites in it but it is still larger than my hand. It was also pretty yummy. I love when my burrito is grilled perfectly so that there is a slight crunch on the tortilla. You can tell the fillings are all very fresh and the meat is seasoned well. It is not overly salty which is good. Also, there is free guac!   Pay a visit to this place and I think you will be pretty happy"}
{"text":"ordered my food online when i got there i was told to call in to confirm the order.  The food was good but nothing special.  Not likely to go back bc the online experience was horrible."}
{"text":"I've been craving Mexican food and loved that this opened right down the street from me.  First, walking in, you can tell the restaurant is well-taken care of.  The lights are bright, the floors are clean, and the tables are regularly cleared (children, throw out your own garbage in the trash can dammit).  The toppings were also very fresh and tidy; I felt secure as I cautiously examined the tomatoes and lettuce.    The service was great.  The gentleman who served me was very friendly and joked that there was like 30 seconds left as I paced the shop waiting for my burrito on the grill.    So, I got the burrito.  I liked having everything on it, but maybe not the refried beans next time as they were a little too sweet.  Guac is also free (!!!)  The steak burrito was massive for $11.50 and definitely as packed as could be.  One of the downsides was my fault.  I think I was making the staff anxious by staring at my burrito while it grilled and they gave it to me a little too early so the cheese was only half melted and a little cold on the inside :(  The other downside was the steak they used.  I'm used to seeing my steak raw and marinated then being cooked in front of me.  They steak they used were already cooked and then thawed out on the stove."}
{"text":"I was so excited when i saw that a new burrito place was coming to Main Street/Markham! Markham has a shortage of Mexican & burrito options. My first visit to Get & Go Burrito, I tried out their steak burrito and quesedilla for my kids. Huge hit! Their veggie bar of options for the quesadilla & burritos is clean and offers a large variety of fresh healthy ingredients. There is always more than 1 person working so you have 1 person taking your order and 1 person taking care of pressing the burrito once it's filled. The press gives it a crispy outside and helps hold everything together - also tastes amazing! Get & Go is my Go To for Burritos! Can't wait to try the fries that others have posted about!"}
{"text":"ordered a spicy bbq steak burrito. add toppings as you please. you can't really screw this one up. you choose everything on your own so if it sucks, it's kinda on you. mexican food is one of the best things to happen to mankind so of course i loved it. i asked for hot sauce in my burrito and noticed that the server was just doing droplets of hot sauce across the burrito. being very conservative. i asked her what was in the hot sauce she said habanero peppers. I think she added jsut the right amount of hot sauce to still have an enjoyable meal and not be in pain. glad to have found burrito place close to home."}
{"text":"Fast and fresh tasty burritos!  Get & Go and Burrito is one of the new restaurants that have been popping up on Main street on Markham road between Hwy 7 and 16th. Inside, you will find a very new and modern seating area that could seat 12-14 people. The owners were really friendly as I popped in to try it out after getting a haircut nearby.  My first impression was this was just a \"one item burrito place\" but to my surprise they also have tacos, \"bowl\" versions of burritos and quesadilla. Lots of choices for meats e.g. chicken, steak, halibut and even combos of steak and chicken. I ordered a small steak and chicken and it was BIG! I can't imagine what a large sized one would look like! They are very generous with the toppings that included the usual lettuce, tomatoe, red/green onion, corn, salsa, guacamole, jalapenos. After piling a mound of fresh and delicious toppings, the burrito is wrapped and toasted on the flat-top. Taste-wise - it was great and definitely filling for a small size which will set you back 8-10 (depending on what you order).  So if you are craving a burrito in the Markham area, it definitely hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Good: 1. Fresh and hot - All burritos come out piping hot and pressed neatly into a brick shaped package.  Ingredients are fresh and tasty.  Neutral: 1. Takes a bit of time to prepare but quality is there so the wait is worth it.  Worth it? Yes, one of the better burrito places out there."}
{"text":"3.5 stars to be exact. Good burrito place in Markham but not absolutely exceptional. Get&Go has a nice shop on Main St Markham, which is clean and simple. The staff is very friendly.  The food is tasty. For fast food they take quite a while to actually make it, but that's because they start cooking everything when you place your order, which guarantees freshness. The portions are quite large and the burrito is extremely filling. The supreme fries are good as well.   I wouldn't say this place is amazing, like a food destination you would purposely plan to go to, but it's a good stop for when you're craving some Mexican food in Markham."}
{"text":"3 Star for food + 0.5 star for being the only burrito joint in the area  Get and Go serves up delicious food at a reasonable price. The small is perfect lunch portion!  Toppings is fresh and always generous.  Being the only burrito joint on the hood, Get and Go is an nice addition to Main Street Markham.   Worth dropping by if you are in the hood and have burrito cravings!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a burrito or a burrito bowl! Great portion if your really hungry! Fresh ingredients, quick service!"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp and steak with all the fix'ens and it was one of my most memorable burritos I had ever had. You can tell the ingredients were fresh and the flavours were just wonderful. Would highly recommend! Looking forward to trying the halibut burrito next time."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located on main street Markham. I am pleased to have a decent burrito place in my hood.  Place is bright and clean with a couple tables for you to sit and eat if you choose to. I notice that a lot people just get take out. Burrito size is fair; small burrito is a good size and enough for me. Service was efficient for a self-serve restaurant.  We had: 1. Supreme fries $5.5: comes with ground beef, tomatoes, green onion, cheese sauce and some other sauce. This was just ok IMO; I didn't think it was as good as other yelpers suggested  2. Steak burrito: fresh toppings and they are quite generous too. Steak had good flavour and burrito was nicely grilled. Will definitely get this again. 3. Chicken mango burrito: it was good and interesting. The fresh slices of mango added interesting sweet taste to the chicken but I could do without mango next time. It's interesting to try.  Overall I was pleased with the quality and prices. Will come back. I want to try the fish tacos next time"}
{"text":"Hands down my new favourite burrito place!  Came on a Sunday night; the place was quiet and clean (which I would expect as they weren't busy) but what I didn't expect was how great and fresh was food was!  First off, their menu is great. They have a good variety, but what I really like is that you can mix and match meat! They even have fish and shrimp which are made to order which is awesome. I got the chicken and shrimp.   Secondly, they have proper refried beans! They add just the right amount of beans and rice to the burrito.  Thirdly (the part that surprised me the most) was how fresh everything was.  The best part - you don't have to pay extra for guac!!!!  I really hope this place is here to stay! There have been a few other restaurants in this location that have failed, but this one is seriously worth checking out!"}
