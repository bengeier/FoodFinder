{"text":"The ceasar is fantastic! Stick to the appies and dim sum. The mains are over priced. Pretty sure they cut the scallop up three times and charged $23 for it. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I have used Yelp for years but never had a reason to create an account until now.  I finally caved in to my girlfriend and took her here. I should have known better when I walked in and saw the place empty except for maybe 2 tables at 7:30 pm on a Friday night. The decor was nice though, and the staff was enthusiastic. I had no idea it opened by the winner of Masterchef Canada, so when he mentioned that, I got pretty excited.  We ordered 3 items to start: grandpas' fung guo (recommended by the waiter), ceviche, and the curry. The lobster chow mein was also recommended, but I wasn't too hungry nor was I too keen on spending $25 on a tapas dish.   The fung guo was bland. There is nothing more to say about it. At $8 for 3 pieces, I expected it to taste better than the frozen dim sum I can buy at the grocery store.  The ceviche was disgusting. My girlfriend always orders ceviche if it's on a menu, so I have had my fair share. This was just diced up shrimp and scallops on top of guac. It was too sour for us to even eat half.   The curry was pretty good. My dining partner thought it was too salty but I thought it was decent compared to the garbage that was my 2 previous dishes. She also ordered a cosmo which she did like though.  Overall, the bill came to $70+ for 3 tapas dishes and a drink. I had to eat again a couple of hours later. $70+ for a snack is ridiculous given the quality of the food. There are so many better similar restaurants out there, and this one seems to be putting random ingredients together and calling itself \"Asian Fusion\" in attempt to cash in on the hype right now.   It could be possible I just didn't order the \"right\" items, but I will never find out."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents for lunch. I was really impressed with the decor- super trendy artwork and has a nice layout. Menu selection was okay. A lot of the portions are really small so you have to get multiple played. Overall the food was good but expensive for what it is. I liked the soup filled dumplings And the bibimbap and lobster chow mein."}
{"text":"Some mildly innovative dishes from a \"master chef\".   Overall, the duck was tender but spices hardly out of the ordinary, oysters were tangy and tasty, and shrimp on Paris toasts a highlight. Dessert (fried bananas and some mishmosh of raspberry compote and ice cream was refreshing but again, not entirely inventive or uniquely tasty.   Perhaps the hype is hard to live up to, but there were more pleasant surprises to the pallette to be found at Gilead (RIP)."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight. Big disappointment. Everything we ordered tasted the same. The ceviche was disgusting, pieces of shrimp and scallops swimming in avocado. No flavour at all.  The crab dish was a bunch of veggies and rice with a sprinkle of crab that the waitress smooched around in a bowl. It tasted like hay and rice. No flavour!  The fried chicken was a joke. Hard as rock. Gross! The lobster noodles were gross. Also hard, no flavour.  The only thing that was decent were the oysters that the chef didn't cook.  The drinks were also terrible! Service also sucked. There are way too many good restaurants in Toronto.  Try at your own risk.  Not sure what they are thinking.  Overall the food is terrible."}
{"text":"Went to R&D for first time as this is a pricey restaurant. Summerlicious is an opportunity for me to try out different cuisines without breaking the bank. This was a HUGE Disappointment on many fronts: 1. this restaurant is owned by Masterchef winner Eric Cheong and Judge Alvin Leung my expectations were high; 2. I ordered off the Summerlicious menu, which is an opportunity for restaurants to showcase their quality and uniqueness especially for first timers, the offerings were bland. I had the Kalbi Tostada which looked like 1 large round nacho chip with guacamole and red bean paste; the Braised Beef Lo Mein was swimming in the high sodium sauce with a couple small chunks of beef, could not tell you what it tasted like as I kept drinking water and my cocktails to dilute the salt from my mouth; and Matcha cake which was over baked as the exterior was hard as a cookie and the interior was dry and the side teaspoon of matcha icecream came in a puddle ( I tried to moisten the cake with the little bit of ice cream). The only positive about the restaurant is the location. I would not recommend this place to anyone, nor will I be going back. The cuisine at Mcdonald is better. The restaurant is surrounded by more affordable venues with better quality food."}
{"text":"To start off, the service was horrendous. We had a reservation for 8 guests and we had one extra person show up. We asked the server for our table if she could bring another chair and but instead of providing any solutions - she merely told us that we had a set reservation, there were no extra chairs and we could not block the aisle. That was our mistake, having an extra person so we let that go and squished into the spot. Then, when she asked us what drinks we wanted, we asked for some water whilst we looked at the drink menu and she merely gestured to a water jug at the center of the table and said \"the water is right in front of you.\" Even though we had no glasses in which you pour said water into. The entire night, our multiple servers were either curt or rude.   We thought that the food would redeem the restaurant as it was started by some celebrity masterchef. We were quite mistaken. The food was mediocre at best - overpriced and all the \"fusion\" dishes were just covered in hoisin sauce and were much too salty. We tried the following dishes (ordered for 3 of us at the table).  -Crispy Pork Belly Bao (so-so, very fatty and didn't have much flavour, but at least wasn't salty) -Grandpa's Fun Gao (tasted bland but we were glad it wasn't overpowered by any sauces as it was steamed) -Beef Tataki (probably the best thing we had all night though the meat quality was tough but the flavours were good) -Kalbi Pork Short Ribs (the sauce that was used to glaze the meat wasn't thoroughly cooked and had a weird mushy consistency. The rice cakes and apple sauce on the bottom however was very good) -Stone Bowl Bimbimbap (worst dish of the night - I have absolutely nothing good to say about this dish)  Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Let me be the first person to write an honest review. I'm sure everyone has high hopes for this restaurant in particular, as the first winner of MasterChef Canada and a Michelin star restaurant owner are the faces of this new place. The decor is great and the service was excellent. The food however... I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone I know.   I am asian and all my guests were as well. We were looking forward to all the dishes we ordered. The presentation of every dish was nicely done but I wish I could say the same for the flavour... Of all of them. The beef tongue tasted like dry ham, the lobster chow mein was boring and the beef tartare was mediocre. My yolk was over cooked.   The mains were the most disappointing. The steak bernaise was good. Not the best I've ever had but it was the only thing we actually liked. The fried chicken was just fried chicken. The duck was so upsetting. Lee's Peking duck is a much better approach. The bao was a good idea to be different. The last time I've had bao instead of flour wraps was in houston but even then, houston was much better. The skin was not crispy and if they say they are \"trying something new\" they FAILED. The duck was cut as thick as the steak was. For $68 you could walk up a block in Chinatown and get the real deal for more than half the price AND it comes with the lettuce wraps. I normally like fusion asian food if it's done right but this restaurant failed. We didn't even order dessert because we were so let down. The bill was $310 for 4 people and in the heart of chinatown I could've went to Xam Yu or Sangs and fed 3 families easily with much more flavor."}
{"text":"Being big fans of MasterChef, my husband and I were very excited to try out this new restaurant last night.  We were impressed with everything.   The food was amazing, the drinks were delicious and our waitress was excellent! Despite having to sit in the lounge because we didn't make a reservation, our experience couldn't of been better. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Toronto so we can get some more of those addictively good bbq pork buns and try more of Eric's cooking! Yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent, attentive service.  Cool, clean interior with open kitchen.  Succulent duck, excellent chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I think this restaurant's best approached as a Western-style restaurant with Asian flavours, or a Celebrity Chef restaurant - because if you go there expecting Chinese food, the prices will seem very high compared to a real chinese restaurant.  My mom and I got a deal on a 4-course meal from Travelzoo, because we've been wanting to try this place since watching Masterchef Season 1 - we especially liked the fact that it was affiliated with the Oliver and Bonacini network of restaurants.  The meals were served Western-style, as individual portions - so I had venison and chili-cheese spring rolls, vegetarian fried rice, chicken and waffles, and chocolate lava cake with cherry sauce and homemade ice cream.  The spring rolls were very unique, and the fried rice was much more flavourful than the rice that's served at a typical restaurant.  The chicken tasted a bit like the crispy chicken with the 5-spice powder you can get at chinese restaurants with the shrimp chips, but this one had a thick crunch crust like the kind they serve at Popeyes - so that too was unique.  And the homemade ice cream was amazing.  I think this restaurant deserves higher than 3 stars - the food is different from what you can find anywhere else, and the restaurant's a lot more upscale than the usual Chinese restaurant.  It's also maybe a little more inviting to people who aren't so comfortable ordering from a menu that's got Chinese writing all over it, with food that's served family-style.  It is rather pricey - but it was nice to be able to try something that was a little bit different from the usual.  By the way, we went early around 6:30pm, so the dishes came very quickly - it seemed to get much busier between 7:30pm and 8pm."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love R&D but everything fell short...   We had dinner during Summerlicious and ordered the following:  - Chicken Satay: Tasted fine.. nothing special - Potstickers: These had pulled pork filling but I didn't think the flavour was distinct enough to tell that it was pulled pork  - Chop Suey Lettuce Wrap: This was pretty good - great variety in mouthful with crunch - Beef Curry: So salty!!! No rice was served with this, and there were only 3 pieces of rice cake, which didn't help off-set the sauce at all. We had to \"borrow\" some rice from the Hainan Chicken dish to eat this.  - Hainan Chicken: Nothing about this dish was good. The chicken was dry, portion was miserly, the rice was hard and dry - what was served was NOT representative a Hainan chicken dish...  - Torched Salmon Belly: The salmon belly was thin, which would have been fine if it wasn't overcooked and dry...  - Mango Panna Cotta: One redeeming factor of this dinner.. this had mini coconut tapioca and the panna cotta was creamy and smooth.  - Pineapple Egg Tart: It didn't have much pineapple taste to it...  - CSB (from regular menu): Second redeeming factor of this dinner. Soft on the inside with a slight crisp on the outside. Delicious!   Overall, this was a disappointing meal, perhaps it's because I went in with such high hopes. Save for the CSB, everything was mediocre at best and I'm not sure I want to come back and try the other items on their regular menu."}
{"text":"R&D can best be described as a non-pretentious version of Lee Restaurant on King. Everything from the graffiti mural of General Mao, faux crumbling walls and the staff wearing orange Home Depot-like aprons creates a laid-back vibe.  Since first stumbling upon MasterChef Canada Season 1 accidentally and following the whole season, I was rooting for Eric the whole time. I was really excited for R&D to finally open. The Chef de Cuisine is also a fellow Queen's University alum!  Now, to the food, which work really well for sharing.    Pina Colada Bubble Tea had great textures with the toasted coconut and tapioca pearls. The sweet and chewy textures contrasted with a really strong-rum flavoured drink.   Salmon Belly and the Lobster Chow Mein: Presentation and plating was great - loved the details! The fresh chunks of lime in the Lobster Chow Mein complemented the dish. Salmon Belly was super tender and the 5-grain healthy rice was really savoury.   Crispy Smoked Milk and Banana Split were great. We loved the sour cherry and peanut butter ice cream - not so much the bitter chocolate flavour. The in-house ice cream - a tribute to Eric's finale dessert from MasterChef - were the highlight.   There was a small mixup when another server delivered our Lobster Chow Mein to the table beside us, who had ordered Eric's Curry. They ate it unknowingly (you think they would ask why they're eating lobster instead of beef). We had to wait a while and we overheard the server \"discreetly\" apologizing to the other table for delivering the wrong dish. Other than that little blimp, service was attentive.   When we were leaving, this random staff said, \"See you tomorrow!\" Bold. Maybe not so soon, but we will definitely be back to try some more dishes."}
{"text":"First paying customer in the door of Eric Chong (winner of Masterchef Canada) and Alvin Leong's restaurant at 241 Spadina Avenue, Toronto.  A wonderful addition to the Toronto food scene.  The food is presented as it is cooked and is great to share dishes.  Nice variety of dishes and wines and kudos to the wait staff .  Eric's curry is not to be missed and Grandpa's Fun Guo Dim Sum is to die for.    If God made anything better, he kept it for himself!!!   Best of luck.  Lu & Barbra"}
{"text":"We came here after having a craving for Peking duck.  When we walked in, the atmosphere was great - but we asked to move to the rear of the restaurant since the front is a bit breezy.  To start, we knew that just wanted the duck, so we ordered it right away.  They ran out of the only Argentenian wine they carry by the glass and only had Ontario wines left.    The decor is fantastic and we had high expectations.  The waitress brought out our duck, and explained what would be done.  Very quickly, it was brought out, beautifully sliced on a bamboo platter.  It came with a small handful of leeks and some sliced cucumbers.  The pancakes were quartered, very oily, and thick.  The waitress said to let her know when we wanted more.  Given that there were only about 8 quarters in the basket, we figured we'd be asking for the next round relatively quickly.  The duck looked great, but had zero flavour.  We ended up ordering chili sauce (house or regular sriracha?  we chose house), and then ordered the next round of pancakes, leeks, and cucumbers.  We ended up passing on dessert so we could catch a movie.  The bill came, and we were shocked to be charged extra (and separately!) for pancakes, leeks/cucumbers, and hot sauce!  It just seemed so trivial and completely unexpected - given that they never mentioned any charge.  I normally wouldn't mind, but given that the duck itself wasn't very good, I felt I should write a review.  I won't be going back and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Ate at R&D twice in the past several days. The cocktails and food were amazing. The roasted duck was the best that I've ever had, as were many of the smaller dishes that were great for sharing. The Chef and Sous Chef really take their craft seriously and prepare their food with a level of detail that you typically don't get to experience at such a reasonable price-point. When it comes to eating Chinese food, there are many choices in Chinatown, many of which are ho-hum food and mediocre at best. Go to R&D with good company, enjoy a cocktail and take your time eating your way through the menu....you simply won't regret it !!!"}
{"text":"I came in with very low expectations given some of the reviews on here but was mildly surprised. It was for my birthday dinner with 4 other girls. We ordered the CSB, crispy pork belly bao, chicken satay skewers, beef curry and laksa seafood chow mein. The standouts were the CSB, pork belly bao and the beef curry to me. The girls didn't think the CSB was as good but I thought it was different and savoury. The beef curry was delicious, I ate every last drop of it. Be sure to order it with some jasmine coconut rice because the rice cakes won't do it for you. My girl also enjoyed the chow mein but the chicken satay was average according to another.   Service was slow but got the job done. They actually accommodated an extra guest last minute when I called, so that was really nice. Really wanted to try their desserts but we were so full."}
{"text":"I think they cook as if they were on MasterChef. The portions are way too small for the price they charge.  My friend and I ordered five dishes and no drinks.  The bill was $45 per person.  At that price, we could have very well gone to Momofuku daisho and would have had a better experience.  If the restaurant wanted to go for high-end, I'd expect the decors, furniture, and light fixtures to be expensive.. not some cheap wood-veneer tables or pixelated wall murals.  And the service should also be top-notch.  I'd say their waiters and waitresses should have a meal at Momofuku or Buca to experience what a nice restaurant is supposed to be like.  To be fair, the food tasted good. Just way too little.  You need to pre-eat before you go, and get Menchie's afterwards.  It's a restaurant that you go once and will never go again."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Went with my parents and boyfriend and we all loved every mouthful. Would highly recommend R&D"}
{"text":"Let me start from the beginning.  I went there with my family to celebrate CNY last Sunday.  We all ordered from the Winterlicious menu.  While the hostess was great, it was not enough to offset my horrible experience overall.  I can't speak on behalf of my family, but I think they'd say that in general the food is mediocre and overpriced.  I'll tell you why I gave it 1 star - I GOT FOOD POISONING!  I ordered the Korean Chicken Skewers as an appetizer, the rice cakes as the main, and the Lychee dessert.  Dinner was at 7:15pm... ended around 9pm or so.  I went home, did my usual thing, and promptly went to bed.  2:30am - I wake up with severe stomach cramps and the urge to go.  I didn't end up having any diarrhea, but threw up at least 4-5 times in my bathtub, and sink.  I noticed that I was throwing up food that hadn't been digested yet.  I saw that there was undigested chicken, and a closer look revealed that piece was actually completely RAW, and another piece that was also quite raw despite having grill marks on it...  I felt a lot better after throwing up, but still had stomach cramps.  My husband (bless his soul) and my toddler had to accompany me to the ER to be safe. **PICTURES ARE UPLOADED**  Now you might wonder/ask why would I eat raw chicken?  Shouldn't I be able to tell that the chicken is raw?  When the chicken arrived, it was covered in red sauce, and the chicken appeared to be grilled.  Unfortunately, I think the grill marks clouded my judgment.  After the incident, I notified Public Health and also told the staff at the restaurant that I had done so and that they will likely be inspected shortly.  I received a call back from the Senior Manager at R&D, apologizing for the incident.  She said she would 'speak with senior management' to see what they can do.  The health inspector also called me to say that the place was in impeccable shape, and that all the temperatures were in the right range, etc. etc.... well, it could be that I HAD TOLD THEM THE HEALTH INSPECTOR WAS COMING SO THAT THEY HAD TIME TO GET THEIR CRAP TOGETHER.  Public Health has actually had more follow-up than the restaurant.  I'm disappointed with the way this was handled.  Although no one else in my family got sick, and maybe that it was a 'freak accident' that out of all the chicken skewers they made that night, they missed one... NO ONE should have double check to see if their food is thoroughly cooked, especially from an establishment that's linked with O&B.  I certainly won't be coming back, nor will my family or friends."}
{"text":"The cocktails were fine. The service was slow. The food was mediocre.   I came, I saw, I left hungry  (and out $100.00)."}
{"text":"It's true, the pork buns are incredible.  We also had the lobster chow mein, little dragon buns, grandpas fun guo and bibimbap.   When it comes to the food (especially the mains) there was no presentation, these dishes all were presented exactly as they would be in a regular dim sum restaurant.... and they came out just as fast, which means that with the food we ordered (above) we were all done in 30 minutes.  IF the flavour blew us away, then it would have been great, or IF we had no other chinese food in Toronto it would have been great and different--but it was no better than  a regular chinese restaurant (except for those pork buns, those were awesome) combine this with average service and R&D is an unfortunate disappointment.  So why two stars??  For the price we paid, we felt quickly churned out, nobody rushed us at all but it was like a \"okay we're done all of our food already....now what\".  Toronto already has great Chinese food at terrific prices.  R&D should have done more to differentiate their product in a city that already produces comparable food for the same or less.  I can get a bibimbap in Korea town for less than 1/2 what they are charging, the price would be palateable if the bibimbap was 2x as good at R&D but it just isnt....it was just a little different.  The table next to us ordered a few different items, yet we heard them joking about the cost as well.  I do not suggest lowering prices.  Work on the menu and improve the customer experience along with it to validate the prices.  The way the food came out and was presented made it seem like everything was pre-made and just steamed or fried before we got it."}
{"text":"i visited R&D this past week for the first time after hearing all the craze about it. I don't follow Masterchef Canada (only one I've seen is Masterchef Junior because come on, who doesn't like kids cooking?)  This restaurant is beautifully decorated with very rustic yet modern tones. Great for casual business encounters or a nice dinner for a small group.   To make this review quick, here are some highlights:  - If you go, you MUST get the CSB (cha siu bao) - these are made fresh every hour. - The Lobster Chow Mein was good but I thought it should've been a bit warmer  - Crab bibimbap is bombtastic - definitely a different spin to your traditional bibimbap. It's also pretty filling - The General Sanders (which is basically their spin on chicken and waffles) is a lot bigger than it looks - please share this with at least one more person unless you want to go into a food coma at the table. It comes with the kung pao sauce as well as a slightly sweeter sauce. The HK egg waffles were good but a bit hard. The chicken was do delicious - the flavour seeped from the crispy skin deep into the actual meat of the chicken and the chicken was cooked just perfect - no dryness! - The dumplings were a bit soggy - they weren't one of our favourites   For dessert, I tried the creme brulee with the sour cherry - note that the sour cherry tastes more like a sour plum sorbet? I would pick the smoked milk with malted ice cream over that.  Expect to spend a bit more here but it's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Solid special dishes and service. Traditional dishes were not special here but that's not really what you're here for!  We ordered BBQ pork buns, little dragon buns(lamb), octopus and general Sanders chicken. Absolutely loved the octopus, the buns were unique but not blown away. The general Sanders chicken was well cooked but try something else if you're here for the first time (just fried chicken)."}
{"text":"I was really, really hoping that I would like this place because I followed a Master Chef and was a fan of Eric and Alvin.  I ordered some stuff off the menu but every time I tried to get something I really wanted, the waitress said it wasn't available today.  There were a lot of things not available.  That was not good.  The food is not too bad, but not great either.  My partner absolutely hated the food though.  For the price it's at, it's 3 or 4 times more expensive than other places   I would give this place a two star, but I got horribly sick with stomach problems and chills a while after eating it.  Considering I ate nothing else in the day except this place, it only leads to me being sick because of the weird meats I ate."}
{"text":"Drinks; Amazing!  Had a few of the \"Plum & Stormy\" (their version of a Dark & Stormy) and could have easily had three more if I could.  Best version of a Dark & Stormy thus far! Food; Amazing!  Had the Grandpa's Fun Guo; Potstickers; Sichuan Scallop Ceviche; Octopus a la Plancha; Fried Chicken & Glazed Cronuts; and the Flat Iron Steak.  Each \"Small\" fostered the next and it was a continuous build of flavors.  For the \"Large\" ensure that you have the Flat Iron Steak before the Fried Chicken & Glazed Cronuts.  Both are excellent but the Fried Chicken is much more flavorful and may outshine the Flat Iron Steak if consumed first. Service; Amazing!  Ellen was a wealth of knowledge and literally recommended the entire setting; from drinks to mains.  Understood the allergies presented and catered to them when possibly, and steered away when needed.  A VERY important part of the trade and she navigated it perfectly; THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"3.5/5! I am impressed by the new asian fusion restaurants that have opened in Toronto. While DaiLo is still my favourite, we were pleased with the food, drinks and service at R&D. Personally, we enjoyed the appetizers a lot more than the mains and if we went back it would be for the Dimsum and drinks (or the large family duck dish). For starters, I recommend the CSB pork buns and grandpa's fun guo. We should have ordered the pork belly as well (next time). The beef curry was good but the chow mein was just okay. I think we had really high expectations of the mains given all the reviews - so if you go in with low expectations you'll be pleased. As for drinks - try the thai basil burbon smash!"}
{"text":"Best SERVICE in Toronto! The waiters aren't overbearing and so inconspicuous that my friend and I barely noticed when they refilled our glasses!   However, the food is hit and miss. Most of the dishes had elements that needed improvement.  Char Siu Bao: Really sweet on top. Really savory inside. Traditional char siu bao tastes better because the sweet and savory flavors are well combined.  Grandpa's Fun Guo: It was alright but nothing special. Might as well order it at a normal dim sum restaurant for half the price!  Roasted beet gado gado: Basically tasted like boiled beets with peanut butter and soya sauce  slapped on top. It was disgusting! Can't believe I paid $8 for that!  Shitake Polenta Fries: Best dish of the night! Interesting textures, and a great and less guilty way to eat fries!  Brussel Sprouts: Also very good, but I could roast brussel sprouts at home that would taste just as good.  Palm sugar creme brulee: The sour cherry gelato really compliments the creme brulee. The creme brulee tastes different. I think they used evaporated milk instead of regular milk, but I think there's a reason why it's normally made with regular milk.  Eric is young and inexperienced, but I was expecting more with Alvin Leung as his partner. Glad to have tried the restaurant though since I am a fan of Masterchef, but I would only come back for the polenta fries or the chance for a selfie!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night and were seated at the bar because we didn't make a reservation. The atmosphere in the restaurant was quiet and the interior design was very modern. The staff was very friendly and gave us good recommendations.   We tried the pork belly bao, the tacos, soft shell crab bibimbap and the steak with cheese hollandaise sauce. I would definitely recommend these items and I look forward to trying this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice. I had a really bad experience the first time around because of a certain blonde space cadet of a server who was so busy chatting with her co-worker that she completely ignored our table and made so many mistakes. Thats why i was a little reluctant to go the second time around, but it was for a birthday and boy am i glad that i went. We had so much fun!!   Our server this time, Christina, is very attentive, funny, and professional. She is also very patience with our table and took the time to explain and suggest the food. Our water was never empty. Food is also amazing!!! They just recently changed their menu. Chicken and cronuts is heavenly!! Their chow mein could be improved tho...and their duck....i could not even begin to describe it!!! It is the \"best duck in the city!!\" And dont even get me to start on their csb....i could eat that pork bun everyday!!  Moving on to drinks...their wine list is terrible!!!! But i guess with an amazing cocktail list, they dont really care about selling wines. Their 510 caesar is probably the best caesar in the city!!  Overall i would come back the third time around with enthusiasm."}
{"text":"My friends and I tried R&D for lunch today. Service was very attentive and the place looked great.  We started off with the shrimp toast and fun guo. Both were excellent but the shrimp toast was by far, my favourite. (I would go back again and again just to have this) For mains, I had the crab bibimbap, which was good. I find it not as spicy as in traditional Korean restaurants. The poached egg on top was a fun twist.  My companions had the salmon belly and lobster chow mein, which they both complimented.  All in all, I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant and would definitely be back for the dimsum!"}
{"text":"This place is CRAZY good! The menu is always evolving but so detailed and nuanced. Really enjoyed this last visit. Such  incredible flavours, presentation. It's exciting to be there! The food is very interactive and the staff totally get how to throw a party! The cocktail menu is off the charts. Brilliant taste and execution (and super hot bartender) . Well done R and D!"}
{"text":"Delicious!   My guy and I enjoyed everything we ate and drank here.   I'm not a 'foodie' which means I don't know much about preparing, cooking or baking food.  My signature 'dish' is a killer cheese sandwich.  But I am an 'eatie' which means I'm capable of determining what's so delicious it makes me exclaim out loud and makes life worth living again [or maybe that was the alcohol].    We had -  TO EAT Egg rolls [a bit greasy and stingy on the filling but tasty] Grandpa's Fun Guo  [delicious filling; I wanted to order 4 more baskets but I like fitting into my pants] Eric's Curry [flavourful, hearty and filling] General Sander's Chicken [crunchy spicy coating, tender chicken, huge serving]  TO DRINK Flor de banana [yum! like a banana daiquiri; p.s. slushies aren't daiquiris] Big Trouble in Lower Spadina [my guy had this; I tasted it - nicely balanced and complex flavours] Sichuan maple old fashioned [also my guy; a bit sweeter than a typical old fashioned but good]  I'd recommend this place to anyone without fear of having them report back to say it sucked.  The decor?  Fantastic.    The music?  The one flaw - an odd random choice of old and not necessarily good tunes.  Going back this week. :)"}
{"text":"I had read the numerous reviews of this place and it all seemed mixed.  Some gave it raving reviews and others not so much.  I wanted to see for myself what exactly this resto had to offer so my husband and I came here for lunch yesterday.    We ordered:  1) Grandpa's Fun Guo - Flavourful is the word I would use to describe it.  Expensive for 3 pieces of dim sum (esp when down the street you can get it for 2 dollars).  But I do have to give it credit, this is probably the best thing we ate while here.  My husband felt that the cashews/ nuts needed to be a bit chunkier to give it more of a texture.  Otherwise it was fine.   2) Poutine - Not good.  It's essentially cubed potatoes and sweet potatoes topped with some cheese, silken tofu and some sauce.  The potatoes were inconsistently cooked - some were clearly underdone.  The flavour profile is interesting....it's not spicy, not savoury, not sweet.  It's not really appetizing.   3) General Sander's chicken platter - This was a relatively large dish for 25 dollars.  I think we got 6 pieces of dark meat chicken in total and an HK style egg waffle.  Let's start with the chicken.  The chicken was good.  Good crispy exterior albeit slightly dark in colour and perhaps slightly overdone.  Thankfully they give you dark meat otherwise I think it would be terribly dry.  Next, the dipping sauce.  One of them is a sichuan maple syrup.  It is absolutely atrocious.  It's not spicy...it's not sweet...it didn't enhance the flavour of the chicken.  The only word I could use to describe this is terribly unpalatable.  After dipping my first piece of chicken into it, I could not bear to touch it again...it was that awful.  Next are the HK style egg waffles which are actually a shade of dark brown.  They looked overdone.  But when you actually eat it, it's actually UNDERDONE inside! What?? How is that possible...it looks near burnt but inside is actually a thick underdone batter.  If anyone has ever had HK style waffles they're actually quite light and loose inside.    We actually told the hostess or waitress about the underdone yet seemingly overdone waffles.  Her response was \"Ok.\"  Nothing was done to address it and we're not asking for a discount or a free meal or anything but we really just want them to be aware that this is not how HK style waffles are supposed to be. We're not even sure if the message got passed along to the kitchen.     We also asked for sparking water which I'm fairly certain they keep on tap and make themselves.  For this water, we were charged 5 dollars.  Ok, I get it if you have to open up a bottle of San Pellegrino or Perrier or something but you didn't.  You just added carbon dioxide to your own tap water! Some restaurants give this for free (i.e. Pizzeria Libretto).  So why are you charging me 5 dollars for not even opening up a bottle of anything?    When this first restaurant opened, I wanted to like it.  I occasionally watched the first season of Masterchef Canada and watched Eric cook and to be honest, I was kind of rooting for him since not many Asians win and he also went to my alma mater. Not only that but when I was in Hong Kong earlier this year, I wanted to try Bo Innovation but couldn't because I couldn't eat a lot of the food they were serving as I was pregnant but had heard good things from family and friends who ate it.   Unfortunately this restaurant was not good and overpriced.  The one word I would use to describe the food is unpalatable.  I think that speaks volumes unfortunately.  We did see Eric come in during our meal and he was carrying a huge bag of rice and some other things.  Seems like he's putting a lot of hard work into the restaurant but as much as I would like to like it, objectively it just wasn't good.  So I really hope things change."}
{"text":"Had a great experience  Started dinner off with some bites. If you like truffle then you'll like these apps. Had many components to it that just meshed well altogether. The preserved duck egg in the shrimp toast may be a little overpowering - enjoyed it nonetheless: Wind-dried Salmon (torched cured ham, truffled honey, crispy rice) Shrimp Toast (side stripe prawn, black truffle, cauliflower, preserved duck egg, english mustard)  Little Dragon Buns Spicy Sichuan Lamb - not too spicy, and definitely has the gamey lamb flavour (may be a little biased, I don't really eat lamb) Chicken Tom Yum - nice and juicy  Dinner Duck Duck Bao (Pekin duck, served with 8 steamed baos, smoked plum sauce and 3 slaws) Although pricey but well worth it. Size can be split between 2 people if thats' all you're eating, good sized meal for 3 people if you're ordering another app The skin - smoked and crisp The baos were soft and sweet (but not to sweet) Slaws offered a variety of flavours - loved all of it  Ceviche (prawn, scallops, daikon, \"jolo\" (chinese pickle sauce) butter, served with crispy taro chips) Enjoyed this dish a lot - good amount of shrimp and scallop. Not salty unlike most ceviches. The daikon adds a nice refreshing texture. Although not mentioned in the list of ingredients, avocado puree is mixed in there as well. Only thing was, I wish there were more taro chips provided   Desserts Banana split - absolutely delicious (If you don't like sour, stay away from the sour cherry ice cream side) Crispy Smoked Milk (lemon ricotta ice cream, burnt marshmallows) - loved this combination, well balanced flavours. Lemon ice cream wasn't too sour  Drinks: Had beer in a High Tea serving - really cute. Instead of a pitcher, it was served in a metallic teapot"}
{"text":"Excited to try this but realizing that it is brand new; including the waitstaff.  Wine list was manageable but mark up was very steep. We had the Malivoire Gamay 2013.  $17.95 from the vineyard and we paid $60. Markup of 233% over cost.  No skewers available.  Lots of duck dishes? Left over Peking duck meat and bones?  Don't bother with the soup. This is duck bak kut teh with overpowering Chinese medicinal taste and a Mazzo ball. I guess, this was real easy to put together.  Grandpa's fun guo : Good flavour in the fillings but no fun guo dumpling should open up when lifted. Chef needs a lesson here.  Beef Tongue with oysters and Chimichurri sauce: The oysters and beef tongue were only OK together . The Chimichurri was bland and a few pieces of chili pepper made for uneven flavour from bite to bite.  Mapo tofu poutine with duck: None of the usual mapo taste; tofu totally lost and potatao and sweet potato chunks were strange bedfellows.Not good.  Eric's curry (add rice: so another $5 or 6): actually very good but the Sichuan Pepper infusion numbed the lips and that may be the reason for the tasteless beef tongue. (served very quickly; don't order it until you are ready for the last course).  Ribs: over dressed and over coated. Way too sweet. The slaw with pineapple however was very, very good.  General Sanders's chicken: Excellent chicken deep fried to a very crispy coating yet very juicy meat. The chef who made the HK egg waffles needs a lesson from the little ladies from Pacific Mall.   Overall: 5 out of 10;"}
{"text":"The server was always attentive and show great knowledge to all the ingredients in the food. We ordered Cha Siu bao, little dragon dumplings, mushrooms, salmon belly, chilli crab bibimbap and lobster chao mien, in which they were all tasty. If I had to recommend one dish it would definitely be the Cha Siu bao, the crunchy outside layer of the bread stuffed with bbq pork is a match in heaven. But there is one thing I would suggest for improvement is the skin of the little dragon dumpling should be thinner and make sure the paper won't stick to the bottom of the dumpling otherwise the juice will leak out. All in all, the restaurant has great atmosphere, service and food! Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Went here Wednesday night with a friend to check it out on a less busy night. It was early around 6 o'clock. They sat us in the front area by the bar as the restaurant area in the back had reservations for later that evening. (Although by the time we finished dinner and cashed out many of those tables were still empty). Our server recommended that we share items on the menu. We started with the chicken egg rolls. I would not count these as egg roll. They are just a little bit thicker then  a chopstick and wrapped in a translucent flour wrap rather then a thicker wrap you would see on an egg roll. 3 to an order makes sharing a challenge and they fall apart when you cut in half. The flavor was okay but left something to be desired as they are so skinny you can't get a lot of filling in. Next we had the little Dragon buns chicken also. These are supposed to have soup stock inside -but they didn't and they stuck to the paper in the steam basket and ripped when we picked them up. Next we tried the lobster chow mein($25). It's a relatively small bowl of wide noodles, about five or six small pieces of a lobster and enough Ginger to blow your head off. Finally- we shared the general sanders chicken($25). This dish they brought to us while we were still trying to peel the steam buns off the paper and finish our lobster chow mein. We had to ask them to bring it back to the kitchen as we had no room on our tiny table and we're still eating our first course. When they cleared our earlier dishes and brought the chicken it felt like it was a little over crispy. we got two chicken thighs and two drumsticks seasoned with a Chinese all spice flavor that was really nice once you got through all the batter. The waffles were also dry as I'm assuming they were sitting on the ledge in the kitchen while we finished our earlier course. No dessert was desired by then end."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner with my friends and we had a reservation for 4 people at 7.45 pm, but we came early and waited for an hour. I came here just for eric, but he was off on tuesdays which disappointed me, but I will come back to this restaurant again just to see him. We were not seated till 8pm, but it was ok since the waitress kept apologizing. Once we sat down we ordered the lobster chow mein, grandpa's fun guo, bbq pork buns, eric's curry, general sander's chicken, full sweet and sour pork ribs, the coloured rice and for dessert we ordered the banana split and the coconut sugar creme brulee. The lobster chow mein wasn't a big portion, but just alittle lobster in the noodles, the full sweet and sour pork ribs look like the half once because it only came with 10 ribs and they are tiny. The general sander's chicken was good, but the waffles thats came with it was burnt and was sent back to the kitchen for another one, but the second one was almost bunt too lol.. What i like was the coloured rice because the rice had so much favor into it, the grandpa's fun guo was also excellent too and the bbq pork buns was fresh and crispy which i like. The banana split was huge, but the only ice cream I like in it was the peanut one. The other 2 was the chocolate and the cherry ice cream. The chocolate ice cream was too sweet and the cherry ice cream was so sour. The coconut sugar creme brulee was excellent except for the cherry ice cream on top of it since it tasted sour. I will definitely come back to this restaurant just to see eric since I didn't get to see him this time lol.."}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch a while back.  Restaurant looks great, there's an open concept kitchen so you can see Eric and co cooking.  We ordered:  Grandpa's fun guo ($8)- good amount of filling, but a bit dry  Lobster chow mein ($23)- good, nothing special.  Two pieces of lobster in small-ish sized bowl of noodles.  Tapas portion at full blown entree price.  General sanders' chicken ($25)- interesting concept with the HK egg waffles but something about them tasted off.  I asked if they added something different but the waitress said no they were traditional style...umm ok.  Chicken was pretty good, I liked the maple syrup but disliked the other one that came with it.  Crispy smoked milk ($8) - this was pretty good.    Service was great and that's the reason for the third star.  If it were just on food, I'd give 2.  Nothing stellar tasting and portions are misaligned with the price points."}
{"text":"Bought the Master Chef hype and came here for dinner. Fairly disappointed.   The dumplings / dim sum was soggy and unimaginative.   Tried the tiger skins as we were told they would be fairly spicy. Nadda.   The fried chicken was tasty and the waffle was a Korean interpretation. The chicken was cooked well and I would recommend.   Our sever was very friendly but not too attentive.   Saw a couple strollers here which means expect to see young families as well."}
{"text":"Worst meal ever! Completely overhyped. Toronto already has much better Chinese restaurants for way less money. Great interior and for that they get one star."}
{"text":"Eric from Masterchef Canada runs this joint and it's Aaaaamazing.  Everything on the menu looks good and everything we tried was delish!  Lobster chow mein, bbq buns, and Grandpa's Fun Guo dumplings- yum!!  The interior design is super cool as well, love the different ambiance that stretches across the restaurant.  Go and try for yourself and order the Moonstone Margarita- you'll die!"}
{"text":"meh!  Food is OK.   If I pay CDN 13 for potatoes with poached eggs, I would expect a lot more.   At the same time if you charge customers CDN 13 for potatoes and eggs, you'd better do a better job  Presentation is a total disaster. Everything is just like stirfir Tastes is ok Ingredient quality failed  BBQ bun comes with irregular shapes  Little dragon bun is aweful.  never had soup dumplings with no soup in it and the shell is thick like wall paper Chinese Hash  skipped Spring rolls ??  it's Oil covered rolls  I saw other table ordered the Chicken Waffle.   It's again, looks like a big brown playdoh rolling around on top of a wooden plate  Come on.  it's not the same quality I saw Eric did on TV  yes he is working there. But does he care?"}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker for a very early dinner. We decided to take seat in the lounge area as we just wanted a quick bite. The dining room is perfect for a date night tho.  I started things off with a silk road spritz which was nice and refreshing. We had the fanny bay oyster wrap (2pc),  the little dragon lamb buns (3pc), grilled octopus and chop suey. The dish that stood out the most to us was the oyster wrap which was also the least expensive of them all.  Loved the décor, ambiance and the service was also great."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Good music. Food was great but a bit more expensive than it needed to be."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this MasterChef Canada winner restaurant since it opened last month and was happened to be in the area looking for dinner, so why not give this a try?  We walked in for an early dinner on a week night without reservation, and was seated in the bar/lounge area. The overall experience was pretty enjoyable, service was good, but I wouldn't say food was that remarkable. I mean they were good, maybe I expect a little more for MasterChef quality. We ordered:   1. General Sanders' Chicken  Was it the best deep fried chicken that I've had? No, the chicken wasn't as juicy as I like. Was it the best HK egg waffles that I've had? No, the shell of the egg waffles wasn't as crispy as I like. The kung pao sauce and sichuan maple syrup were rather interesting though, it's an okay dish, but I don't find it special.  2. CSB (baked char siu bao) We waited for more than an hour for the CSB to be baked, but it's worth the wait! This is a revamped bbq pork bun dim sum, I like it. The bao was very light and flavourful.   3. Crispy Smoked Milk (with malted milk ice cream) The smoked flavour was pretty strong for this one, the smoked milk tasted and smelled burnt at first, but when I ate the smoked milk with the malted milk ice cream, I kinda like it, it's something out of the ordinary if you feel like trying something new."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere and Wonderful Food!   My partner and I wanted to try R&D ever since we found out they serve Peking duck. We made reservations for Friday evening, specifying that we were interested in the duck.   When we arrived, we were seated at the back portion of the restaurant, with a nice view of the open kitchen. Service was slightly slow, as it appeared only two waiters were working in the area (serving larger groups).   We ordered several cocktails, mainly Sake based, as well as some appetizers. The tuna tartare & CSB were really good. The tartare was slightly over seasoned--a little too acidic for my liking.   Now for the duck. The servers brought it to us prior to carving and explained how it is cooked. The duck was cooked to a perfect medium rare with crispy skin. I am not the biggest fan of duck (due to the fat content), but my partner loved every bit of it. The dish is definitely meant for at least four people. We took half of the duck home.   The overall experience was great. There are certain points, such a slower service and slightly over seasoned food, which stop me from giving R&D five starts. I will be returning for more great cocktails and some fusion cuisine."}
{"text":"The food here is inspired by traditional chinese food with touch of modern twist. I really enjoyed the cha siu bao dish although it's relatively heavier the \"ham\" is delicate and just enough sweetness. Their drinks also are 5/5 in creativity and taste."}
{"text":"Owner and chef Eric Chong, from MasterChef Canada fame, can frequently be found working the kitchen. We were fortunate enough that he was running the show the night we visited. He sat and chatted with us for a bit and was definitely the highlight of our visit. Although the food was quite good, the flavours weren't unique/innovative enough to justify the tapas portions or high-end prices. Best to stick to regular dim sum or Chinese food to avoid buyer's remorse."}
{"text":"WoW!  This place is AMAZING!  Went there last night (on a Friday, 7 - 9pm) as a group of 4 and was pleased I had made a reservation, as I got a better table, and in less than an hour of arriving all the tables were packed and the place was full of people to overflowing, including the bar and lounge area up front where hip young couples and sexy looking groups were enjoying hi-end cocktails and all the yummy food.  There was a convenient Green P underground lot just 4 doors up the street which was only $5 for the whole night 6pm - 6am.  Our waitress was very perky and friendly and after going thru the cocktail menu to discuss her favs (and why WaterMelon goes well with Cucumber) she spent a ton of time on the main menu describing everything and making excellent recommendations.  We ordered 7 or 8 things which we shared among us.  We even shared 3 desserts among the 4 of us.  When our main waitress was busy they sent over an assistant waitress and at one point the Manager from Manchester served us and we all melted from his sexy accent, not to mention that he is over 6'6\" tall!  When I asked if there was another reason he could come back to our table he came over and sat down beside us and told us a quick dirty poem.  So cute!  I'd go back just to be attended to by him, he was so charming.  The food was so interesting, not being anything close to standard Chinese, but I guess that's why it's called Fusion.  Really interesting hi-end dishes, most of which should be shared as they are not really plated for one person, as there is all of one item on a plate, not mixed to be a one person meal.  So plan to share, which we really enjoyed.  Our bill including the 22% tip we wanted to leave was $260.oo, so while not cheap certainly not outrageous for a group of 4 @ $65 each, although it could have been higher as we only had one drink each and might have ordered more drinks and yummy gourmet dishes if we had wanted to make more of a night of it an hang out for another hour (or two!).  This actually would be a great place to eat and hang out at for a whole evening, as the people at the bar tables up front looked like they were doing, there for an evening of cocktails and finger food while socializing.  I think this is the first place that I have given 5 stars to and they certainly deserve it!  Can't say enough things about the amazing food and the charming atmosphere, and the incredible serving team!  Well done guys!!!!!!  I will absolutely be back soon and return often!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night with my girl friends for a reunion dinner. We made reservations at 7pm but was surprised when we walked in that the place is mostly empty. We were seated immediately and was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance and open concept kitchen. We ordered the chicken and waffle, the beef curry, lobster chow mien, and soft shell bibimbap. Very good experience overall, however, the waitress seemed unhappy that we wanted to split the bill as it seems like a bother to her. Other than that, it was overall a decent experience and would return again for special dinners as the price is higher than most other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Asian fusion in a beautiful space!  We were here for a birthday dinner, my friend is a big fan of Master Chef Canada.   Overall, the food was good but overpriced.  The CSB is like a sweet BBQ pork bao... But at $4 a pop?   The kalbi ribs were a good portion, but I wasn't a fan of the flavours of the kale apple mixture it's served with. Bitter but sweet and over spicy.   The Peking duck was gorgeous.  It was a good size for our group. It's fancy but also at a fancy price.   The service here was lacking for a large group.  We had to flag down servers and we were given bills before dessert was ordered.    I might give this place another try, but unfortunately not impressed after my first visit."}
{"text":"After watching Masterchef Canada Season One and seeing Eric Chong win, I just had to jump on the opportunity to try out his restaurant. Thanks to the mentorship of Alvin Leung, he's definitely build a great career for himself.  R&D, a nice modern style/hipster-ish restaurant represents a new look and fresh start to Chinatown Toronto. Located in the place of the once Strada 241, you'll really need to look carefully for the place. The restaurant exterior is dark and with a small R&D sign so you'll really need to look twice to find it. Once you enter the restaurant you get a great feel of openness and hospitality. You see an awesome bar with a few beer taps and wall display. The kitchen is open so you can see what everyone is doing... including Chef Eric Chong and Nelson Tsai themselves. A little further in you'll see the really nice dining display. The floors and ceiling are laid with old wood giving a very cool hipster feel.  The menu is very simple with a great selection of appetizers, plates and platters. The appetizers consist of his famous dumplings (or in otherwords his grand dad's dumplings), skewers and independent sides. The plates consist of entree dishes such as Lobster Chow Mein, Crab Bimbimbap and Sweetbreads. The platters from looking at other tables are massive with 76hour Peking Duck, General Sanders' Chicken which was oddly fried chicken with HK egg waffles. Definitely something different.  I had ordered the following:  1) CSB - Cha Siu Bao - instead of the typical steamed bun served at dim sum. It was a fresh baked bun stuffed with delicious bbq pork. This is made every hour and we were lucky to get a fresh batch. The waitress reserved them for us. it comes in 2 pieces and cost $8.  2) Grandpa's Fun Guo - chicken and black truffle steamed dumplings - 3 piece dish at $9 was definitely the highlight of the night for me. This was made by the hands of Eric himself as he came to our table to tell us that. Great dish and wish they served more. I'd get a large order of it.  3) Sweetbreads - Oyster sauce, crispy seaweed, mushroom, sweet potato - a nice entree dish with fried sweetbread chunks missed in oyster sauce and topped with large portions of crispy seaweed. It was tasty but not something I'd order much of. $18.  4) Crab Bimbimbap - R&D chili sauce, kimchi egg - a typical bimbimbap dish with small chunks of crab and egg. The server comes with a typical korean stew dish, stuffed with rice and kimchi, and with a small side dish of hot sauce which gets poured into the main burning hot dish with the rice. He mixes it thoroughly and leaves it to sit for a few mins. You get the nice crispy rice at the end. Definitely goes well with the Sweetbread if you have any left. $18.  If you're lucky Eric will come by your table and check on how your meal was. He has no problem taking photos and talking to you. Had a great 10 minute chat with him, explaining his experience with Alvin and trips around the world. Great inspiration and definitely worth going.  I give 4 out of 5 only because it was not easy to find and the sign was small. But if this was on food only, i'd give a perfect score."}
{"text":"R&D's offerings at the Taste of Toronto food festival convinced us to try their restaurant.   We went on a Saturday night and ordered the following dishes: - Pork Bun: Its a must have! Very different to the usual pork buns in terms of texture but out of this world taste! -Shrimp Toast: Another must have! gave me jawline goosebumps lol - Ceviche: Ceviche with avacado sauce (may not be the right word to describe it) was quite good. -Fried Chicken with waffles - 7/10! Maybe because other dishes set the bar too high.  The only negative was that the place gets too hot due to an open kitchen concept. However, once i informed the staff about it, they happily bumped the aircon up! Pretty friendly staff too.  Totally recommend this place for a date!"}
{"text":"I went here becaused I watched the 1st season of Master Chef Canada - was excited to get to eat a meal made by the 1st winner Eric.  Congrats Eric for having your dream come true the restuarant business is hard.  I found the food more like tapa style - we had to order 6 dishes to be full.   Odd that for a \"high end\" asian food you would have the location in the heart of Chinatown.    I won't go back again because the food was good but wasn't impressive for me to return.  Espeically since I am able to get similar asian food elsewhere for half the price and more of it vs small plates."}
{"text":"Slow cooking, we we're in there by ourselves for 20mins before the first dish came, the dim sum buns....yeah....let's just say Chinatown has good dim sum....excluding this place. Then the lobster chow mein,  for $25 feels like your wallet was raped twice, and the taste...good work Alvin on picking your  boy toy as the winner"}
{"text":"We came here for Summerlicious. Not bad for a $28 dinner. However, the plates were very small and I was still hungry afterwards, even after my 3-course meal and clawing at my boyfriend's plates as well.   The restaurant is like a small warehouse with a bunch of artsy mismatched decorations and lights, with high ceilings and windows being only at the front of the restaurant. Be prepared to be within arms reach of your neighbours tables.   I really wanted to try the CSB but they JUST ran out of them when we tried to order. Funny enough, the table beside us also tried to order the CSB, albeit 45 minutes later, and the waitress informed them that they JUST ran out. I wonder how early they actually run out of them. A mystery that will forever haunt me.  We ordered the Jerk chicken buns to start. They did not taste like any jerk chicken I've ever had. Not much flavour and buns were a little soggy. I had 2 bites before I gave up hope on these buns.  For the appetizers, we ordered the chicken satay and the potstickers. The chicken was pretty good. The potstickers were ok, a little weird with pulled pork but I guess that's the \"fusion\" part. They resembled large deep-fried tortellinis.   For our mains, we had the beef curry and the torched salmon belly. Both were delicious and flavourful. The beef curry didn't come with a rice, which I think it should. However, both plates were tiny and not very filling.   For dessert, we got the pineapple egg tart and the dark chocolate brownie. The pineapple egg tart was not very good. It didn't have that smooth richness that normal egg tarts have. It was a little bland and underwhelming. Kind've like eating sweetened cardboard. I didn't try the actual brownie, but the ginger ice cream on blueberry sauce on top of the brownie was delicious!   All in all, a nice little Asian-fusion restaurant catered to those who like to overpay for some white-washed dimsum. I probably won't be returning, but it was nice to experience the restaurant of a MasterChef Canada winner. We even got a glimpse of him!"}
{"text":"I think it's a darn shame that this place only has 3 stars. I'm from Hong Kong and come from a pretty traditional Asian family. I already know my parents would hate this place lol!   They'd hate it because it's not traditional or because they think it's overpriced.   Personally, I went in without the expectation of tradition, only stuff that echoed traditional cuisine. And yeah this place totally is overpriced... But most stuff is compared to a $2.50 fun Guo. You're not just going for the food, it's an experience, something that plays with expectations in an exciting way.   My dining partner and I got their take on a char Siu Bao (CSB), pork belly bao, some fingerling potatoes, scallop ceviche, and kalbi.   The CSB is a signature and I can see why. It's such a nice crispy bun, kind of like the best part of a pineapple bun surrounding the gooey BBQ pork filling as some sort of crunchy delicious buttery shell.   Fingerling Potatoes are a take on a Korean stewed potato banchan. Sauteed in duck fat and coated with some Furikake, it's hard not to like this.   The Kalbi was good, a bit salty but that was balanced by the ddukbokki, crispy on the outside with that velvety cushiony exterior.   The scallop ceviche came as these five awesome bites, with creamy avocado on the bottom and a nice citrusy note from the tiger's milk marinade.   I think for a place like this, you've got to be open minded. Its definitely not cheap, but they're not giving you a cheap experience. I recommend the bar rail seating!   Also they've got $7 cocktails from 5-7 daily and all day on Monday. Great to encourage opening the mind ;)"}
{"text":"The meal started with a hit, CSB (cha siu bao - bbq pork buns topped with a sweet and crunchy pineapple bun topping. They openly admit that it was inspired by Tim Ho Wan's bbq pork buns, and they do a pretty good dupe. The filling is are a little less cha-siu-y with a mellow aftertaste, from mushrooms, perhaps.  Likewise, the service is worth coming back for. We were two of many people seated around the bar, but the service from our bartender cum server was always attentive and personal. From the hostess to the servers, I would give them no less than 10/10 for service.  Unfortunately, the rest of the starters were 'meh'. The oysters reflect what are normally used in chinese cooking,  meaty but fishy.  The tom yum little dragon buns had a strange combination of tastes, and a hardened/dried dough at the top.  Moving onto the entrees, the grilled salmon belly and beef brisket curry were an improvement, but both had very singular flavour profiles were lacking in presentation. The banana split dessert was a treat for my sweet tooth, and a generous portion. However, the coconut whipped cream and the strange ice cream flavours were a mish mash of discordant flavours, reminiscent of a kid dipping his finger in all the flavours in the candy shop.  Luckily for R+D, they have quite the drink menu for those who are adventurous. If you're up for a drink or two, each has a slight asian twist while staying true to the original mix.  All in all, would I go back? Probably.  The General Sanders chicken and the duck duck bao seem enticing,  and the drinks and the service are enough to bring me back. I'll just be a little selective when it comes to the menu.  http://tinyurl.com/ofm6n9u"}
{"text":"it's really not all that.  I had received a lot of hype around it when i told friends I was going here and they really set my expectations high.  we were here for a birthday- a group of 20 I want to say, and they were accommodating. but as you can imagine with a group so large, service is at times compromised.   what I didn't like: the shared bathrooms. I do not appreciate touching a toilet seat in between meals. especially when the conditions of the bathrooms aren't clean. it really grossed me out.   also, there weren't many vegetarian options. especially for one of the guests who was pregnant, they couldn't even make an exception and whip something for her.   onto the pictures I posted of my meals: 1) the servings were incredibly small that even after my apps and main course I was still hungry. the lobster linguini was good but nothing amazing to rave about.   we had asked for separate bills from the beginning, yet somehow incorrect items were still added to bills and it took longer then necessary to pay."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the dishes and been there a few times over the past 2 years. Recently, the food had an improvement. I really liked the venison spring rolls, fun gao and their curry bao. Would try the duck next time."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of things about R&D from my friends and they do not have any good comments for the place. So I wanted to try this place because it is run by Eric, the Masterchef Canada winner, and I wanted to see for myself why my friends made such bad comments.  First thing I noticed after we were seated is that the table was really low. I am a big guy so it was quite uncomfortable sitting down with my knees almost hitting the table itself.   I came here for the summerlicious menu so I was excited to try. From the summerlicious menu I ordered: -kalbi tostada, -Mac & Cheese -Korean pancake  The Kalbi Tostada was great. The pork tenderloin (I thought it was beef since it said Kalbi at first) mixed well together with the guacamole and the chip. It tasted great and I thought to myself, this place is not that bad but oh boy the main and dessert have yet to come.  Next, the Mac N Cheese came and I thought it was a very strange combination. Satay sauce in Mac N Cheese? The taste was strange and I thought this dish was too fusion. Pulled pork was a good addition but does not save the dish. It was disappointing in general as the macaroni noodles were overcooked being too soft. The cheese was the best part of this dish which should not be the only case.  Lastly, the dessert in my opinion was a complete disaster. The Korean pancake came hot and it was hard to cut open with just a spoon. The pancake itself did not have any taste to it and there was minimal filling. The person in my party got the matcha cake and it was dry. The lemon flavour clearly overpowered the matcha flavour and tasted more of a lemon cake. Worst dessert by far from all the summerlicious/winterlicious that I have tried.  On the upside, the service was great. Our server kept pouring water and let us decide what to get for dessert after our mains. The interior decor had a nice modern touch to it.  Overall for $28, I thought it was definitely not worth it. Just an utter disappointment in general from the table setting to the food and I will not be a returning customer."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  From the decor to the friendly wait staff to the music, my wife and I were treated to a great date night experience!  We started with the wind dried salmon and octopus.  Both were delectable and full of flavor! Both dishes were truly unique and were great side by side!  Our mains were the sweet and sour ribs and the curry.  Again the flavors were well balanced and we savored every bite!  We finished with the fried milk.  Unfortunately this was not the best.  The combination was a great idea, combining the flavor of the burnt marshmallow with the lemon ice cream and fired milk.  The only thing that made it bad was the temperature.  Both the friend milk and the brunt marshmallow tastes best when the centers are gooey.  But they both came out cold...   The waiter that served us was fantastic! Very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  Overall I would definitely recommend this place for a great night out.  I plan on being back real soon!  Had to update this review.  I went again with a couple of friends and it was not as good.  It's too bad, I was so excited after the first visit.     And to be fair we had the CSB this time and they were amazing!!!!    But everything else was bad.  Lobster chow mien, crab bibim bap, chicken and waffles, oysters, and the duck duck Bao....   The duck duck Bao was the most disappointing.... It was succulent but the skin was not crispy.  Why would you waste duck like that?  Especially after making us wait 45 min for it. The coleslaw accompaniment did not go with the duck.  Not that the lobster chow mien was any better... We all agreed at the table that there are many food court chow meins that were way better.  The chicken and waffles was fried way too much and was hard.  The oysters were tiny and flavourless, and the bibim bap was bland...  So disappointing considering we had such a great time the first go around.  I still recommend going, but only to try the following dishes: the wind dried salmon, the octopus, and the CSB, Nothing else.  They would be a way better restaurant if they just fixed those menu items..."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is rated so low! Went there last night And I don't have one complaint! The food was delicious!!! Atmosphere and service were incredible! And the cocktails were so yummy! So glad I got to try this place out! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Given the reputation of the chefs and the many Instagram photos of the food, I was expecting great things at R&D! To be honest, the good was hit or miss. It was food, but not spectacular. We ordered off a combination of the summerlicious and the a-la-carte menu.. the mapo tofu was spectacular and probably the best thing we ordered. The fried rice, with  lap cheong and tilapia was also good and the beef tataki was beautifully done! The Mac and cheese, supposedly with satay sauce and lacked the wow factor and the shumai was also ordinary. Desserts were the saving grace, I could eat their Korean pancake everyday! The third star was given for the fantastically attentive service with the right amount of banter and the deliciously innovative cocktails! The best part of my evening was the oolong tea, lavender infused G&T. All in all, a fun experience! Go for the cocktails!"}
{"text":"A winning combo. Alvin Leung, three Michelin-starred restaurant chef/owner of Bo Innovation in Hong Kong and London, meets Eric Chong, winner of the premier season of Master Chef Canada. \"We grew up in the same part of Toronto,\" says Leung, \"but at different times.\" It's a culinary marriage made in reality TV heaven, transformed into the reality of an exciting new Toronto restaurant called R&D.  The Rebel and The Demon threw everything into the pool and developed a menu that is liberated from any parameters. It is Chinese cooking that explores the global community of its neighbouring Kensington Market.  Start with Duck Bak Kut Teh soup with a matzo ball. This is not my bubbie's matzo ball soup, but then again, she never knew about five-spice seasoning. Follow up with  some modern dim sum. Grandpa's Fun Guo steamed half moon dumplings filled with chicken and black truffle are a rarity on a Chinese menu, but a staple in the Chong family kitchen. An order of slim, delicate eggrolls, like fine rolled cigars, gives us a uniquely crisp texture and intensity of chicken and pesto.  The menu is so diverse but each dish is a winner of Master Chef quality. Ceviche of bay scallops, spot and tiger prawns pickled in Szechwan wine and soy sauce, and enrobed in  a jolo butter from Shanghai is a mellifluous medley of east and west and south that cannot be pegged as any one cuisine but reflect the finesse and range of imagination in this kitchen. Chargrilled octopus with choy sum chimichuri and eggplant is reminiscent of a wonderful fresh Latin American oceanside dish but with urban sophistication and flare. Roasted beets in a goat cheese vinaigrette bedazzled with crisp fried lotus root, candied walnuts and ginger bread shows off textures and colours with sweet and tart notes in a dish that knows no culinary borders.  After tasting the ingredients of China town, Mixologist Robin James Wynne has redefined the Pina Colada by infusing chai, as well as toasted coconut shavings and tapioca pearls for a multi-textured beverage that delivers us to the tropics...of Asia.  Admiring the dramatic décor in what was once a Spadina Avenue factory, original floorboards (oh if they could speak), a refined wood ceiling, and a long bar and lounge invites us, but it's the dining room that has wow factor. Two murals convey the personalities of R&D: on the north wall, an interpretation of Eric, \"The Rebel\"; while the south wall belongs to \"The Demon Chef\", Alvin. Perfectly lit, not too bright, not too dim, and energetic music that is not thumping so loud we can't hear ourselves think. It's just very cool.  General Sanders Chicken catches my eye. Neither Tso nor the Colonel ever had it so good. Served on a wooden platter with a dusting of five spice and dips of kung pao and Sichuan maple sauce, we devour the generous portion of tender chicken and HK egg waffles. We love the dish that won Eric the Master Chef competition. His lobster chow  mein of hand-made chitarra noodles and plenty of wok-fried lobster is clean and bursting with flavour.  Holy duck! Chef Leung introduces us to the 76-hour Peking Duck. \"I want you to taste the meat, not just the skin, so we're doing it slightly different...but you would expect that from me anyway,\" he laughs. Served with steamed buns and three slaws of cucumber, scallion and hoisin; mango asian pear and plum; cabbage, carrot and ginger; we've never tasted duck so meaty and tender. We can only guess at the slow three-day cooking infusion that could elicit such flavour.  There is so much more we want to order from this smart menu. It's inventive, with influences and ingredients from across Asia and around the world that showcase the deftness and attitude of these two chefs. For dessert we indulge in smoked-milk fried crisp with malted milk ice cream and a lemon zest. There is a selection of Chinese teas from Pu-erh to the house-made Spadina Blend. We look over and see Eric in the kitchen beaming his signature smile. He is happy, and so are we. As for collaborating with Leung, Chong tells me, \"He made me a bolder chef...This is a dream come true.\"  ~ R&D, 241 Spadina Avenue, 416-586-1241 ~"}
{"text":"I didn't exactly come in with high expectations but I was interested in some of their summerlicious menu items so I decided to book a dinner during that time.   To start off, the decor inside was quite rustic, giving me a feeling of a redone old warehouse feel. They have an open concept kitchen and bar along one side of the restaurant. One of the downsides for me was that we were seated in front of the bar area where the seating was sofas with a low table. I found this to be super awkward to eat at.   We ordered from the summerlicious menu: potstickers & beef satay to start, beef curry & torched salmon for our mains and the panna cotta and chocolate brownie for dessert. For the starters, we thought they were well seasoned and presented but it was nothing too special. When the mains came, I thought the beef curry was a little awkward to eat as it was tender beef served in ample curry sauce with uncut rice cakes. When I ordered the curry, we expected it to be traditional curry where they would either serve bread or rice with it. Since we didn't want to waste any of the curry sauce, we asked for an order of rice on the side but all they had was coconut rice.   My favourite of the night was the chocolate brownie with ginger ice cream and blueberry compote. There was a nice balance between the refreshing ginger ice cream and rich warm brownie. Mmmm"}
{"text":"This meal made me question the integrity of the Food Network and Masterchef Canada.  R&D was one of the worst meals I've ever had.  When you first walk into the restaurant, they lure you in with a false sense of hope that the night will be decent. The decor is certainly well designed, and the semi-open kitchen is modern looking. The menu is also interesting, and broke down all of their \"famous dishes\" with red and blue labels that tells you which Chef came up with it. Brimming with false promise.  What we ordered:  Pork buns - Was actually really good. This was $8 for two small CSB. It wasn't worth the price I guess, but can't complain because it really was delicious. I strongly recommend this dish  as this only thing to try. (take out order only)  Grandpa fun guo - Had a really strong smell of truffle oil in these. It was a bit overpowering but it's truffle oil so I guess it was acceptable. It wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible.   Masterchef winning Seafood and Lobster chow mein - Okay this is where s**t really hit the fan. This dish is stunningly bad. The taste was just bland, contained very minimal seafood and was just a dish of chittara noodles in light soya sauce topped with a small piece of frozen lobster claw. The dish served to us wasn't even warm. I had 2 bites of it, and just couldn't eat it any longer. Stunned at how bad this was.   Chicken and Waffles - So the only redeeming \"fusion\" factor of this dish is with HK waffles. They took out the HK waffles and gave us regular Belgium waffles with fried chicken.  ??????? How hard is it to make HK waffles instead of Belgium waffles? Why would you take away the only appeal to this dish? The chicken isn't even good. Like everyone else mentioned, they loaded the chicken and sauce with a lot of strong spices. I've never EVER turned away fried chicken before. Congratulation R&D, you somehow managed to eff up fried chicken with waffles.   Do not come here.   Look... here's the deal. Masterchef Canada takes a bunch of amateur \"chefs\" and puts them in a competition on TV. If you look at the competitors, none of these guys had any actual restaurant kitchen experience. Even this Eric Chong person was an engineer before he won the show. You can imagine the talent level in the competition. This is like taking your group of friends to have a food competition, picking a winner, and calling him Master Chef of your group of friends. Then you go and open an effing restaurant with the title \"Winner of Master Chef of my group of friends\" to fool people thinking your restaurant is any good.   I do not condone such shady practices. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Kind of expensive. R&D is the kind of restaurant where you really need to know what you'll be getting before ordering. They have some great dishes and some that are just so so. CRISPY PORK BELLY is must to have. Skip VENISON CHILI SPRING ROLLS. SCALLOP CEVICHE is my favourite. LAKSA SEAFOOD CHOW MEIN is nothing special. BEEF TATAKI is excellent. The wine selection is limited. Notice it's cheaper to order wine in glass than in bottle."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch (Summerlicious) and thought it was fantastic. For appetizers, we got the Haddock Mousse and Pork Belly Bao. While the haddock was pretty good (the wonton crisps were nice and crunchy), we both agreed the bao was our favourite. The meat-to-bun ratio was perfect, and the slices of pork were cooked perfectly. The sauce was savoury as well.  For the main course, we got the Mac & Cheese and the Fried Rice. The satay sauce in the mac & cheese was a nice addition that gave the dish a different taste compared to \"regular\" mac & cheese, but there didn't seem to be a lot of pulled pork in the dish. There was also a ginger taste that I'm personally not a fan of. However, the fried rice was absolutely amazing! It was on the spicy side but was full of flavour. The top layer added a crunch to each spoonful, making it truly a unique take on regular fried rice.  For dessert, we got the Korean Pancake and the Matcha Cake. Both came with a scoop of ice cream which complemented the main dessert nicely. However, both of them were just ok. There was nothing about them that stood out. The matcha cake was a bit dry and the pancake was average.  Overall, R&D offers a fun, interesting take on Asian cuisine. While not all of the dishes were memorable, there were a few (bao and fried rice) that I would definitely order again."}
{"text":"Ok, so my review is based solely on my experience at the bar. Hope is the best bartender ever! She makes one hell of a Cosmo and I highly recommend the Confuscious Cosmo or hard cider.   $7 drinks 7 days a week from 5-7."}
{"text":"Great job guys! Loved grampa's fun goh! Also props to the lobster chow mein and pork ribs. Beautiful restaurant with friendly staff. Eric was working and happily took a photo with us as well. The hater comments below are weird. Yes the prices are much higher than your average spot in Chinatown - but this is not your average spot. It is refine and modern with great service and food. If you lifted the restaurant and put it in yorkville or Yonge and eg - maybe people would not blink about the price.   Also not sure why people are complaining about the music....it was fine for me and I liked the fun and modern vibe.   Happy experience - we celebrated our 5 year anniversary here."}
{"text":"I must preface this with the fact that I was very likely never going to or very unlikely to come to this place on my own. Upscale Chinese or Asian good often turns me off because of the multitude of cheap delicious offering you can get in this area of any area makes it a hard choice.   My coworkers and I are here for a going away party for one of them moving away. I arrive 30 minutes before the rest of the party and was greeted and sat at our table right away. I notice that the chef and winner of MasterChef Canada Eric Chong was in house and on the line in the open concept kitchen!!!! OBVIOUSLY I asked the server if there were any chance we could take a photo. Now I didn't expect a quick yes but I got it and I attach the awkward photos I took with a fellow Eric (with a C) and that actually what we conversed about shortly as I met the chef. Alvin was not there :(. (Btw I was told that Chef Eric Chong often works here and is very visible for sneak photos if you don't have the courage to ask  My party shortly arrived and heard about me geeking out. We got drinks. I really enjoyed the Calm and Stormy made with their fever tree ginger beer. Has a solid ginger bite but not to sweet (balances out really well) my other coworkers got just the ginger beer, still really good and what I remember to be one of the signature cocktails but I forget the name as I'm writing this review weeks later...(sorry)  Let's get down to the food!!!  The Japchae was yummy. Not oily as you can get it sometimes just good solid umami flavour all the veg still had a bite to add contrast to the glass noodle (minus the mushroom obviously). Approved by my Korean friend who also recommended the restaurant. The Chili Crab Siu Mai came next. I was less impressed with this one. The crab held its delicate flavour as you initially ate it or at least the way I did but the pork shrimp base was a little dense and kind of quickly overwhelmed the taste of the crab.   The Laksa Seafood was delicious. Probably my favourite dish of the night. Thicker noodle than when you think of chow mein. The laksa sauce hold onto those noodles and the seafood sweetness really balances with the dish. This is a highly recommended dish for me.   The main draw was this best duck in town which is essentially a Peking duck. Now the server explained the process to us and I might be recalling this slightly wrong but I believes it's cured for a few day (two based on my memory but don't take my word for it) Sous Vide the day of service brought out for photos explanation than carved. Now I watch a lot of cooking television and have only limited cooking. Skill of my own but it sounds like a complicated process. The result being though is a duck that is not Peking Duck. There is lies the issue with the taste. I like the duck for what it is but as it is not reminiscent of Peking duck it made me want the real thing. I will say I just read the Chris Nuttal-Smith review about the previous version of this duck and I only slightly agree. I will say you don't have the crispy skin, there are bits of chew from the unrendered fat and because of the preparation being - sous vide and curing of the meat it has a very like Christmas or large ham sort of taste and texture. If you keep these thing in mind and like that or can appreciate that flavour this duck is pretty good. The pancake doesn't really add to the dish but you can eat it on its own and it's good too.   The service was fantastic based on my own experience. The server was informative, held a decent conversation with a geeked out fan and explained the duck really well (just hard to retain all that information weeks later). The chef is equally approachable and really down to earth and perhaps also awkward like this writer which makes him all the more approachable. The atmosphere is very hipster like with the clash of art on the wall, barrel lights in the ceiling and wooden pillars; all very eclectic.   I would definitely come back to experience more of what this menu has to offer to find the gems off of it but at its prices maybe not regularly. This is how I justify the 4 stars because the food has promise and the atmosphere for me was very kind and welcoming. Looking forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"Really really good flavours. Wait staff wasn't the best, only reason it isn't a 5. We sampled about half the menu, there was not one bad dish!"}
{"text":"Umami Caesar Great flavour, slightly small serving and perhaps a little unbalanced. Not sure if it needed more clams, or more kale... Either way, it's a very interesting dish which has a lot of potential.   Little Dragon Buns (3pcs) Ordered the chicken tom yum. They were good, but not good enough to warrant the $7. Maybe if they added two or three extra, the dish and price would have matched up.   CSB Barbecue Pork Buns UNREAL. They're like pork pastries - \"porkstries\". Significantly sweeter and more cake-like than the usual Chinatown offerings. They really should sell these from a window to passerby on the street. We were told they are made throughout the evening, and that if a fresh set was made available, we'd be served them. Not sure if this is due to the process of making the buns themselves, or what it might be. Sort of a strange approach.   Skewers Unavailable the night we attended. All of them. No reason given.   Eric's Curry $20 for tasty tender brisket in a delicious curry sauce. Some sprigs of greens, but not nearly enough. Just needed some more stuff to soak it up. Potato, kale, rice, noodles...  General Sanders' Chicken Eats like a meal. Seriously, a couple of diners could split this dish, and maybe another one as a side, and it would be enough. I wish they would have been a little more liberal with the five spice, though.  Service Intensely friendly, extremely accommodating and patient. Willing to explain any dish in detail and give a comprehensive rundown of the menu."}
{"text":"I would never give 5 stars but here... wow!! Thank you Julie for the exceptional service and the chefs for the amazing food. Nothing from outside - every thing from the inside!! Thank you for making our last night in Toronto so special."}
{"text":"Finally got to try R&D, opened by Master Chef Canada winner Eric Chong and judge Alvin Leung under the O&B umbrella, and overall it was OK. The concepts and ideas were great, but flavours and execution were below expectations.    If you come before 7pm, they have $7 cocktails and beer. Their cocktails were actually quite good, with 1.5oz to 2oz of liquor in each. We ordered the Yokozuna gin and tonic, barrio Chino, and a lager that was one tap. All were delicious and refreshing on a hot summer evening!  Now the food. We came for the summer 2018 summerlicious menu for $28 per person:  HADDOCK MOUSSE 2/5 not the greatest but not the worst. I'm all for mousse but this was a little odd tasting. Texture was nice and fluffy, but would have preferred pieces of poached haddock.   KALBI TOSTADA 4/5 this had really good flavours. As others mention, the kalbi was pork, but that didn't detract from the taste. The gauc was really good and a nice cilantro punch  JOLMYEON (vegetarian) 3/5 pretty good. Spicey and reminiscent of the Korean bibimbap except with glass noodles. Pretty underwhelming though.    BRAISED BEEF LO MEIN 2/5 beef was not moist or tender, felt like the beef had been sitting in a warming tray for a while. It really should have been CHOW MEIN instead. Frying those noodles would had made this dish way better. Flavour was meh.   RED BEAN PANNA COTTA 1/5 no red bean flavour at all. The panna cotta had the grainy texture of the red beans but lacked any flavour. The ginger cookie pieces overpowered the dish. Good idea, really poorly executed.   KOREAN PANCAKE (vegetarian) 4/5 probably the best dish of the meal. Warm crispy pancakes with a red bean paste inside served with ice cream and strawberry sauce. This was yummy and well done.   Overall, would I come back? Maybe in a year or two to see if the food became more refined (assuming it's still around) Would I recommended this place? Probably not...it would come up in conversation but it would also include the criticisms of the food. Service was ok but nothing to brag home about.   R&D has lots of potential but it just isn't quite there yet. But I do think Eric has a long career and runway ahead of him as well. Cheers."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening for dinner and the restaurant wasn't really at capacity.  Masterchef winner Eric was working hard cooking in the kitchen!  The 4 of us ordered tons of food to try as this was our first time at this restaurant.  CSB - cha siu bao with a twist. It had great flavours but could've used a bit more filling. Crispy pork belly - served in the now trendy bao.  The bao was fluffy and the meat was tender. Grandpa's fun guo - get as many of these as possible if you like the taste of truffles.  AMAZING Chili crab siu mai - more pork than crab and shrimp but it matched well Venison chili spring rolls - long spring rolls with lots of filling.  It was awesome! Highly recommended Son-in-law eggs - deep fried soft boiled eggs with tuna tartare.  The egg was cooked to perfection with the yolk still runny, but the tuna tartare was average. Fried chicken and cronuts - good breading on the chicken, but the meat was a tad dry. Duck fat fingerling potatoes - good tasting potatoes with duck flavours punching you in the face! Yum! Cornbread waffles - the waffle itself was average but the brown butter gelato was great!  Before the meal started, we were going to order a bottle of wine odd the menu but when the server realized we wanted a bottle, he came back with a 'bin end' list with discounted wines!  To end, food was great and service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Well done everybody at Rebels and Demons!!  I came to dinner with my wife with high expectations (Masterchef winner in the kitchen) and they were all exceeded. We sat in the restaurant and were served by Ellen, she was really knowledgeable and took, what seemed to be a busy night, in her stride.  The open kitchen is a great part of the restaurant and next time we come in we will definitely reserve 2 spots at the Chef's table. The Chefs and cooks were a pleasure to watch and all of the food came out a couple dishes at a time (which was perfect).   I had a beer (as usual) but my wife had a watermelon cocktail that she thoroughly enjoyed.   We had the ceviche which was truly one of the best that I've ever had. The CSB pork buns (their signature) were a delight. They are sweet on top with an amazingly light but rich flavour in the centre. We were also brave to take on the Duck, brave because it so big and flavourful but boy is it good. The staff told us that it take 3 days to prepare one duck so we knew we had to try it. There was no way we were finishing it all so we took it home and duck sandwiches for breakfast the next day.  We had to leave room for the banana split and I'm so glad that we did. It's served with 3 house-made ice creams which left me wanting more.  Decor and atmosphere 8/10 Drinks 9/10 Service 9/10 Food 9.5/10  Definitely somewhere that I shall be recommending to my friends."}
{"text":"Having read the earlier reviews, I did not walk in with high hopes. I guess that's probably why I am giving 3 stars instead of something lower.   The CSB (bbq pork buns) are great. The pork filling is wrapped in a pineapple bun like shell. Crispy and flakey on the outside, savoury and tender on the inside. This explains why we got two orders.  Grandpa's dumplings were above average. I hate to do comparisons with other types of restuarants, but honestly, you could get better tasting (and value) at your local dim sum shop.  The fried chicken and cronut was average. The fried chicken was mediocre and the cronut wasn't anything special. There was no complexity of flavors. Just an overall bland greasy or sugary taste.  I knew from reading the earlier reviews, we should have stayed away from the seafood chow mein. But alas, we ordered it to see for ourselves. I really have no problem paying higher prices for good food. But the premise is \"good\" food. The noodles here did not taste fresh. The noodles felt like they were pre-chilled supermarket noodles. The dish had a spicy taste throughout. It was an easy method to overcompensate for the fact that this dish has no other layers of flavour.   The service was on par with other places at similar price points. There was a selection of local craft brews. It is a convenient location on spadina.   Overall, I guess there will always be places where the hype is bigger than what they can actually deliver. The CSBs were good, but not good enough to even out the score."}
{"text":"the food is delicious & all the flavours make sense & dance in your mouth.  couldn't think of a better person to experience R&D with than my love, both for my birthday & Valentine's Day weekend!   the pork belly bao, Grandpa's Fun Guo & Tom Yum mussels are all favourites of mine, along with the Chinese long beans- a dish i grew up eating and still love to this day!  the Green Tea ice cream does NOT disappoint!!   I can't wait to come back, and this place has ruined my love for traditional Dim Sum- I just can't get enough of this place!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Nice vibe/ atmospherics, friendly and competent service, and - most importantly- fantastic food! I had the scallop ceviche and lobster chow mein: both were fantastic. My friend had the steak and Brussels sprouts and was quite impressed.   If in downtown west Toronto, definitely worth some consideration."}
{"text":"Very funky decor. Food was good but nothing impressive. I don't think I would come here again. Tried different dishes like scallop ceviche, pulled pork croquettes, pork tenderloin. It was good for a meal but nothing special."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious. Got the croquettes and curry soup as appetizer, they were not bad. Followed by Tom yum ramen and seafood curry as main. Worst ramen I ever had. No Tom yum flavour at all, noodles was too hard, egg was cold and had no flavour. Seafood curry tasted ok. Lastly, got the toffee pudding and coconut Pandan tart for desserts. Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I came here and tried their Winterlicious menu recently. I really should stop going out on Winterlicious days because I have never have any luck with them.  This time at R n D was no different. I had the noodle salad, beef brisket, and some vanilla dessert. I ordered the Cha Siu Bao and that was the only thing that was good...but seriously paying $8 for 2 baos is not worth it in my opinion. I mean you ARE in Chinatowm afterall... isnt everything supposed to be dirt cheap?  We sat next to a table who questioned the server on why the portion sizes were so small. Little did they realize that this Restaurant caters to a sort of Hipster Fusion casual Fine dining crowd....I know.. Oxymorons galore. But thats totally what this place is.  The food portions are small and Expensive. They taste more like meh but hey you come here to see the Masterchef at work right? The vibe of the restaurant is a casual one but you will not get your typical Dinner for one for 9.95 here.  We spent $100 and I was still really hungry...good thing we were in chinatown I picked up some bbq pork duck and gai lun combo for $12 down the street."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious with fellow yelpies! Def enjoyed the company moreso then the food unfortunately. Every dish was barely warm...not sure if it was sitting for awhile and mad in mass amount for winterlicious. Got the tom yum salmon as a main and the fish was cooked to perfection - not dry. However you could barely taste the tom yum - its more of a creamy dressing. Overall if everything was served hot it would have gotten 4 stars for sure! Great service"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend for happy hour excited to try a new modern fusion restaurant in Toronto and was unfortunately underwhelmed.  Let's start off with the cocktails -- during happy hour, they're $7 and I had my waitress recommend the most popular ones. My friend and I ended up trying the momo margarita and the la chinesca II. Both tasted absolutely dreadful especially the la chinesca and were only moderately strong (which boggled my mind because then what made them taste so awful?!).   For food we had the grandpa's fun guo and the crispy pork belly bao (both very underwhelming and standard). Personally, the only dish I liked and thought was unique to the restaurant was the CSB. Beautifully done (with the flaky top most people dream about) and flavours were spot-on. However, this dish was still a little pricey for the portion and I could definitely still fulfill my CSB craving at any good dimsum place."}
{"text":"I just didn't get it. All the hype, and the nice trendy decor, made me want to love this place. But I just couldn't. The food that arrived seemed so far from my expectations that it seemed like a joke.   Fried chicken- WHAT ON EARTH DID THEY DO TO THAT POOR CHICKEN!!? Firstly, it doesn't look like any recognizable part of a chicken I've ever seen. It looks like they mutilated the chicken and then tied the meat into a knot. It really had the texture of last night's leftover chicken that was refried. The meat was dry, and flavourless, and the skin was way too hard and boring. And the sauces it was served with reminded me of the crap they serve at PF chang. I was shocked at how odd and unpleasant this dish was.   Lobster chow mein- this was actually decent. I am unsure if it was because the other dishes were so bad that made me appreciate this dish even more. BUT value for money is important to me, and this dish doesn't have it. WAY OVERPRICED.   Oyster frittata- this has to be a joke. 4 loonie sized pieces.   dumpling- i forget which one. but it was tiny. like really freaking tiny.   I tried other dishes but they were extremely forgettable. All were tasteless and tiny. I can appreciate the effort for culinary innovation. But this place just went terribly in the wrong direction.   To put into perspective my disappointment I consider this place akin to the much hated PF chang, and in similar fashion is the number one contender so far for worst restaurant of 2015."}
{"text":"We came here as a group of four on a Wednesday night at 7pm during the holidays. The restaurant was empty, but I could see that many of the tables were set up for large parties that evening.  The friends I was with enjoyed the restaurant on their previous visit. Since this was my first time, I expected the food to be stellar.  I had the chicken and black truffle fun guo to start. The filling was tasty. My boyfriend ordered the pork belly bao. I did not try it, but he seemed to enjoy it.  As our main dish, we shared the chicken and waffles and lobster chow mein.   Their waffle maker was out of commission that night, so we had \"regular\" waffles - not the HK-style waffles they usually serve. The chicken was good, but was a little heavy on the breading. Our friends, who also ordered the chicken, noticed their serving was all dark meat - we suggested to the server that perhaps a mix of dark and white meat would be better next time.  As for the chow mein, the lobster was good, but I felt the rest of the dish was not memorable. I wanted the serving to be a tad larger, and I longed for thin noodles (and crispy edges!) - something I expect from a chow men dish. Nevertheless, \"fusion\" is the name of the game - so I digress.  For dessert, we had apple crumble. It was okay. The dollop of vanilla ice cream on top was very small.  I loved the design of the restaurant - the art on the walls, the lighting fixtures, the pintucked banquettes. I wished the music was louder and more contemporary. The vibe of the restaurant was not as upbeat as I wanted it to be."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried chicken but it was raw. The servers showed it to the \"chef\" twice and they said it was fine, but they actually just showed it to the manager... I would highly recommend against coming here as their food was sub par, service was poor, and their cocktails were horrible! DO NOT EVER TRY THE PINA COLATA BUBBLE TEA! It was a mixture of rum and water with shaved coconut on the top. I was not impressed with the overall experience!"}
{"text":"Overall the food and service were good but is it worth the money is another question.  ceviche - This was my favourite dish of the night with the avocado puree acting as the citrus I thought this was pretty unique and made it different from other ceviches.  grandpa's fun guo - Good but nothing particularly interesting. To me it was like any fun guo you could find at any dim sum restaurant just executed better.   lobster chow mein - Tastewise this was good and I liked the pieces of lime scattered throughout the dish that went well when eaten together with the lobster. The noodles tasted like a drier non-spicy version of Malaysian mee goreng...though I happen to love mee goreng so I liked the noodles too but overall found the flavours too familiar and expected something more unique. It was also hard for me to find the value in this dish at $25 considering the portion size which I found to be small.  CSB - I actually really liked this, probably the best BBQ pork bun I've ever had but at the end of the day it's still just a BBQ pork bun so take that as you will.  general sanders' chicken - Also good but too salty. I liked that the egg waffles were cooked more than the ones you would typically buy giving them a crispy texture. Wasn't a fan of the sichuan maple syrup though.  So to sum up the food, everything taste wise was good but I just couldn't silence my inner cheapness reminding me that this small plate of dim sum costs $8 or that I could just go buy some popeyes and a bag of egg waffles from up the street for way less than $25. For someone less familiar with dim sum I'd recommend it but after going once I don't see myself returning any time soon."}
{"text":"This is my second time in the restaurant the first time I was here its when it first open and the menu was different staff was super nice and helpful. Guess it all went downhill in one short year. I am a vegetarian and never have much problems dining out on any restaurant that is consider 'trendy'. However R&D failed to provide ANY meatless options and only have literally 3 menu items that is vegetarian friendly. So I ordered 2 out of the 3 only options which was vegetable bimbibap ($18) and black been brussel ($12) spout without the pork sausage. The bimbibap is very average, comparable to any bimbibap at standard Korean restaurant with half the price. The waiter served the bimbibap to the table and immediately poured all the spicy sauce onto the stone bowl and mix it in front of us to serve which the dish turned out to be very salty and over dressed, I would like the option to have it mix on my own but it all happened so fast without asking us if that is even an option. The brussel spout with black bean sauce is unbearably salty and greasy (even without the pork sausage) and I gently brought it up to the waiter when he asked how our meal was going, he stood by the dish unapologetically and insisted it has to be this salty to mask the grassy taste of brussel spout. To me it is the slight grassiness of the green that makes it so unique. (But what do I know I am not the winner of Master Chef) The way he took our experience and feedback was not only unfriendly but defensive in which I would not consider returning to a restaurant that is so inflexible, stubborn and over priced for what it is. And the cherry on top of this unpleasant dining experience was the waiter was complaining to our faces that it is a lot of work for him to do share bills, he did it at the end but with such attitude even though when we first sat down he could not had emphasize more that the menu is designed to be shared. (It is only logical for the bills to be shared too? apparently not?) My meat eating friends ordered the fried chicken and cronuts and beef sticky rice with lotus leaf wrapped. They said the sticky rice is not bad however the cronuts and fried chicken is a very odd combo that doesn't quite work together since their cronuts is cheesy inside but glazed with sugar outside.  To me is the staff that full of attitude and complaints in combination with the mediocrity of the food that make dining here such an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner recently. Tried the venison spring rolls, cauliflower curry, Peking duck and some wine and drinks. Food was all good if a bit pricey for the portions. Not much cauliflower for $12.00. Needed extra pancakes to finish the duck and was charged $2.50. Thought that was a bit petty after paying $72.00 for the duck. Small wine list. Some interesting cocktails."}
{"text":"R&D is the restaurant associated with Chef Eric Chong (first winner of Masterchef Canada) and Chef Alvin Leung (judge on Masterchef Canada). The design of the restaurant has an industrial feel but modern. The restaurant has an upscale and grandiose.   The food is Asian inspired - playing and reinventing classic Chinese dishes. Some of the standouts include the BBQ Pork Buns (CSB), bibimbap and Work Fried Lobster Chitarra Noodles. The BBQ Pork Buns, in particular, was a treat - a sweet light pastry with a savoury pork filling.   The food was good, but the price was a little high. R&D is located near Chinatown where you can get fresh BBQ Pork Buns and authentic bibimbap for a fraction of the price. This is the reason I gave R&D restaurant 3 stars instead of 4 or 5. I do not mind paying for an expensive meal. However, when I know I can get real Chinese food for a fraction of the price, I can't help but feel that the food is overpriced.    Overall, I would recommend R&D if you enjoy Asian fusion in a trendy environment. It is a nice restaurant with great cocktails. It is a great place to have a few drinks and a few bites with friends."}
{"text":"Finally tried Masterchef Canada's Winner Eric Chong's asian fusion resto! And it was cool to see him in person working away in the kitchen. However, now I can see why the reviews are average because the overall experience was just ok. Came here on the first night of the Winterlicious event so decided to try their 3 course dinner menu. I didn't have high expectations for the food based on the reviews that I read ahead of time. The food lacked quality and flavour but presentation was there for being an asian fusion \"upscale\" restaurant. We sat beside a table where the patron was complaining that the portions were small for the price of each dish. I mean c'mon what do you expect for a fancy asian restaurant. I think the location of this restaurant was a bad choice because most people in Chinatown expect cheap and quick food in a casual environment so I think that it has attracted the wrong clientele.   The food was really just mediocre. My fiancé and I ordered the Winterlicious menu consisting of the Glass noodle salad, Korean chicken skewers, Braised beef ribs, Tom Yum ramen, Lychee Panna Cotta, and Coconut Tart and nothing really stood out. The ramen didn't taste like ramen at all, there wasn't enough broth in the bowl like you would find in a bowl of noodles in soup. The Panna Cotta was probably the most disappointing, I was expecting more of a bursting \"lychee\" flavour but tasted really plain. Honestly, the best tasting dish that we ordered was the Baked Char Siu Bao which others have also commented the same, freshly baked, melts in your mouth and the breading was just tasty. Thumbs up for this appetizer.   Service was decent but very pushy, I have never been to a restaurant where our plates got turned over so fast. It almost seemed like either they didn't have enough plates or just hinting that they needed our table.   If I had to give a true rating, I would give this a 2.5 but since there isn't an option, then 3 stars is close enough.   Nice ambience but the prices do not speak for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed myself at R&D last night.   Really chill vibe in a restaurants that's likely considered a little more high end in the area.   Our server provided great suggestions for a menu that looked amazing on all fronts.   I tried all the baos and they were so tasty. I had the quail risotto which was ammmmaaazzzing!! (The only item on the menu the server hadn't tried so I figured I'd dive in). The only thing that was a bit disappointing were the spring rolls. But cocktails, wine, apps and entrees were all worth another visit!"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in the middle of Chinatown.  Recommended to anyone looking for Asian fusion (with strong influences from Chinese cuisine).  My wife and I visited on a bit of a slow mid-week evening.  We were lucky to be dining on the very first day of their new menu and were impressed with the CSB BBQ pork buns, grandpa's fun guo, and Colonel Tso's chicken and waffle.  The shrimp toast was also nice but the bread was deep-fried and a bit oily--we mentioned this feedback to the staff and they were very receptive to our comments.  We also weren't impressed with Eric's lobster and seafood chow mein, it's not bad, but it didn't wow us.  Pros: - friendly staff - lots of seating - interesting decor, especially the ceiling lights - of course, the food!  Inventive without being too overboard.  Cons: - not much"}
{"text":"Their menu items are definitely off the beaten path of traditional Asian cooking. Full marks on this front. Presentation and flavour hits the spot.   Unfortunately the texture and the actual cooking of some dishes were very disappointing. Take for instance the Seafood Fried Noodles. It was bland except for it being overbearingly spicy. The dish lacked life but had the visual substance. The major disappointment of the evening goes to the String Beans. According to our server, the string bean are \"suppose to be like that as it was deep fried.\" I've had plenty of traditional Chinese cooking, and can testify that the string beans are definitely deep fried; however, for a brief moment and then stir fried. Ultimately with the texture of it still being crunchy and full of \"life.\" The way it was prepared here came out as if I was chewing on grass! It was tough, and did I mention it felt like I was eating grass? [Aside: I've had eaten grass years ago as it was accidentally mixed in a chives dish, and I thought it fun to try it rather than putting it aside. The string beans that evening was very similar to the grass I had a difficult time chewing.].   The Pork Bun was pathetic. And I wasn't particularly happy with the Scallops - I was expecting a warm dish, not cold. The flavouring and texture of the scallops wasn't my \"cup of tea.\"   Now, to the good stuff. The mango pudding was a winner, but at $10 it took away from the \"value\" aspect. Finally, for me, of all the other dishes we ordered, the Beef Ribs was the best entree of the evening."}
{"text":"I love the innovation in food that the owners have introduced to downtown Toronto.   Food tastes great & ideas are refreshing - old world meets new world modern dining  I don't always like to eat a complete dish so I like the sharing plates. I like being able to sample a dozen different dishes and not waste food.  Favs are lobster noodles, dumplings, fried chicken, ice cream, spring roll, BBQ buns  I like to support small businesses and entrepreneurs. I will definitely be back. Hope to see more specials and R&D creations!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a while and debunk the average reviews it got on Yelp. I came here with an open mind and left feeling like the highest I can give it is a 3.5/5 overall and would come back here just for cocktails.  Food: I had the Winterlicious lunch menu:  BBQ Pulled Pork Croquettes 3/5 - This dish was okay. The gong bo sauce went very well with it. But the texture wasn't what I expected, more like crab cakes.  Macanese Seafood Curry - 3/5 - I would give it a 2/5 if it wasn't for all the seafood in it. This dish really should have came with a side of rice or noodles. It was a bowl full of curry without anything to go with it. I saw other tables maybe got the heads up and ordered rice with it.  Sticky Toffee Pudding 3/5 - It was good.  Bai Tai cocktail 5/5 - I've heard great things about the cocktails and this was very unique and well done.  Service: 4/5 Our server was very friendly and despite there being a bottle of water at our table for us, she still came by and poured water for us when our glass was more than half empty which I really appreciated and didn't expect.   Honourable mention: I wanted to give recognition to the really cool decor and really neat wall art. Also, I noticed the restaurant is accessible, there is a lift right at the front of the restaurant for those that are not able to walk up the stairs. A very important feature to make it accessible for all food and drink lovers."}
{"text":"Sigh* Where do I start.....  I've heard so much about this place in the past year but never really looked into it. Decided to check it out this past weekend and as I did a bit more research, I realized it's helmed by 2 highly popular chefs. It piqued my interest but from the mixed reviews, I kept my expectations low. Somehow, R&D still managed to fall below that.   The decor is really trendy but not what you would imagine for a place that serves asian fusion. In fact, there wasn't anything Asian about the restaurant at all except for a ginormous picture of Mao Zedong on the wall. Gave me more of a pizzeria or taco vibe.   For 2, we ordered:  CSB BBQ Pork Buns ($8) - These were fantastic and really the only item I found to be worth it. The sauce and cha siu is delicious and perfectly in proportion to the amount of dough. I loved the texture of the exterior which is crispy like the top of a pineapple bun. $4 for a medium-sized bun isn't exactly a steal deal but I highly enjoyed it. 5/5  Grandpa's Fun Guo ($8) - Not bad. Served as 3 dumplings in a dimsum basket. Had me wondering where the soy sauce was but after biting into it, I realized I didn't need it. That's because the truffle gives a very strong aroma and flavor that really hits you. The dumpling skin was a bit too sticky for my tastes but it was pretty good. One of the better items but had me searching for water immediately after having it. 3.5/5  Eric's Seafood & Lobster Chow Mein ($25) - I was iffy about paying this much for chow mein but decided to go for it anyways since it seemed like a popular item and was featured on the show. HUGE mistake. I still don't understand how this dish is $25. I second guess myself wondering if my taste buds lack the sophistication to fully appreciate this or if I've always had really bad chow mein my entire life. My boyfriend and I took a bite each and couldn't be bothered to take another. I'm not sure how adding a few shrimps and a piece or two of lobster hikes up the price to about three times the amount it's usually offered at. Or was it the chitarra as noodles? Either way, this dish was definitely memorable ...because I never had such a lacking and ridiculously overpriced \"chow mein\" before. This is an example of what asian fusion should not be. It's so light in flavor that it's border-lined tasteless and it was just so underwhelming in all aspects. Not to mention the noodles were cold. We asked our server to take it back which she asked why. We told her our reasons, she simply said ok and left with it. Not sure if it was conveyed to the kitchen but I had already mentally checked out of this place at this point.1/5  Colonel Tso's Chicken & Waffles ($25) - Let me clarify that they no longer serve HK egg waffles but just a Belgian waffle with chicken. I didn't know this when I ordered so I couldn't help but ask the server to which he seemed genuinely surprised himself that HK egg waffles were a thing at the restaurant. He came back and informed us that they NO LONGER serve the HK egg waffles. My utter disappointment aside, I have to ask......how is this fusion? I really despise it when restaurants sprinkle some asian ingredients on a western dish and call it fusion. One, it's never cheap and two, it's a cop out of the entire term. Chicken was drizzled with kung pao sauce and seasoned with 5-spice. Overseasoned and overpowering. The breading was very thick with almost a burnt flavor to it and although it was crispy, way too heavy. Meat was dark so it made it less dry but the accompanying sauce to dip, Sichuan Maple Syrup was a disaster. It didn't complement the dish in any way so I was not a fan. Smh. 1.5/5  Service was subpar. I have to agree with some reviews here that it just didn't seem like they cared. We didn't find out that they comp'd the Chow Mein til the very end which yes, made me less bitter but it would've been nice if they informed us during the meal. You know, so I could be a little less miserable and not cry for my wallet the whole time. Or perhaps a manager should've come out to speak to us since we literally ate 10% of our chow mein and we gave up halfway through the chicken & waffles. Our concerns were never addressed in a proper manner. I know a bad experience can be overlooked if the restaurant does something to alleviate it but their attempt was so half-assed that it didn't do much in terms of redemption.  My advice? Get the CSB to go."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite easy to walk past without noticing it because of the minimal signage. It's also gotten some terrible reviews in the past, but it really do this place justice.   I came here on a Friday evening around 7pm with a couple of friends and it was relatively empty, but we still made reservations just in case. The decor is quirky and modern, infused with Chinese symbols throughout.   The food was phenomenal. The dishes here are suited for sharing so come with a couple of people and split the dishes. My friends and I decided to get our own dishes, but ideally I would've like to try some more dishes by sharing. We all got the CSB, which came piping hot and absolutely melt in your mouth delicious. Similar to the baked char siu buns you would find at dim sum restaurants, but theirs has a nice crumble topping like a pineapple bun that is probably loaded with fat and sugar. I also got the cauliflower curry, while the serving size was small, it was not lacking in flavour. It tasted light and the cauliflower was cooked perfectly. I also tried a bit of my friend's octopus which was super tender and very flavourful.   Don't let the bad reviews discourage you from visiting this place. It's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a birthday here with a large group. The variety of the dishes was intriguing and everything definitely had flavour. The service was some of the best I've ever had in the city. The wait staff was very knowledgeable about the dishes, and ambiance made for a very enjoyable evening. It was definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Excellent and creative cocktails. The tuna tartare (Son-In- Law Eggs) and the Beef Curry, both very good. The standout dish was the Bibimbap. The dessert, cornbread waffles with drunken strawberries and brown butter ice cream- Delish. I will be thinking about that Bibimbap for a long time. Chef Eric was also gracious enough to come say hello and give us a photo-op."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised by the large number of negative reviews here for r&d! I mean, it's an Asian fusion place, which may not be everyone's thing,  and it can be on the pricier end depending on your tastes but you can definitely get an app+main for about $20. The waiters were super nice and attentive, and checked in with everyone at the table about potential food allergies.   Anyways, I ordered the mac and cheese and thought it was fine (not over cooked, there was a good amount of cheese and the satay sauce/cheese combo was good). My friends ordered the ribs and they all absolutely loved it. I think this is one of those places where you have to know what to order before you go (i.e.: the ribs).   Overall I had a good experience, and enjoyed the unique food :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant decor is very neat, comfortable seating.  We went as a group to try as many of the dishes and possible however it was near the end of the night and the CSB and General sander's chicken was sold out, would return to try these.  Chef Eric in the kitchen cooks most of the dishes, and he's so nice and friendly to come over and chat with us and explained how every dish was made (it was the end of the night) it made all the food taste 100x better with his explanation and we really enjoyed and understood/appreciate  the food and drinks more.   However the way our waitress Sara spoke was extremely rude, we did not appreciate her attitude at all, especially when she was trying to explain why the CSB was sold out but just kept talking  and being rude about it."}
{"text":"CHICKEN & WAFFLES!!!! So good here, good portion too.  Sweet and savoury, crispy af! Must try if you like fried chicken and waffles"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, food and vibe at a reasonable price.  The fried chicken is the crispiest I've had but I wish there was a bit more spice and flavor.  The waffles weren't that great and there wasn't enough syrup.  I prefer fluffier, Belgian style waffles.  The pork buns, dumplings, steak tartar and cocktails were all excellent. Nice industrial loft aesthetic and vibe.  Loved the 90s hip hop they played too.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 6 on a Thursday evening. We made reservations, but it didn't seem like they were needed.   The decor and atmosphere were great. Really trendy and much different from what you see in other restaurants in Chinatown. There's a huge photo of Mao staring down at you from the wall. Amusing to some, but it's almost like the Chairman is staring at you while you eat. ;)  Food was hit and miss. We tried a lot of different dishes since there were so many of us.  The Good: CSB (bbq pork buns) - I thought these were great and tasty. They're a hybrid of bbq pork filling but in a pineapple bun pastry. Must try if you like Chinese buns.  Grandpa's Fun Gao - I didn't think I would like these, but they turned out to be very tasty. Everyone at the table loved them.  Scallop Ceviche - Also delicious, but I'm big ceviche fan so I guess I'm biased. I didn't find the lime to be too overpowering, which can sometimes happen with ceviche.  Cauliflower Curry - Surprisingly tasty as well. The curry sauce was subtle, but still had some complex flavours. One of the favourite dishes of the night.  The Bad: Potstickers - I thought these were overly fried and didn't taste like much other than the \"friendness\" of it all.  Ebiyaki - I also thought these were overly fried and were just big doughy balls of fried stuff.  Jerk Chicken Bao - This bao tasted sweet to me and I just dislike the combination.  Beef Curry - Way too much star anise/five spice flavour for my palette, but my friend liked it so there's that.  Seafood Chow Mein - I found this underwhelming but not to the extent some other Yelpers did. I would still recommend you order it to try and make up your own mind.  Mango Panna Cotta - I had high hopes for this one as the description sounded delicious, but I was let down. The panna cotta was not nearly as smooth and creamy as I expected it to be.  I would go back to try the Peking Duck - I've heard it's amazing, but you need to order it a day in advance so the kitchen can properly prep."}
{"text":"Ahhh... R&D. You bring back some pretty interesting memories. First of all, the venue is very hip. There's a medium-size bar area right when you first enter and the restaurant's eclectic, hipster concept is made known very early on with cool mural walls loud(ish) music, and chill-looking staff. Interesting cocktails here, or at least so I've heard... I'm not much of a drinker (anymore) myself, but the first time I was here I did order a fun-looking drink and almost convinced myself that I actually enjoy alcohol. The food and convenient location in Chinatown are what keeps me and my partner coming back when we're looking for that 3-$$$ sign downtown restaurant, i.e. fancy but not schmancy.   As a plant-based eater who eats egg, some dairy, and seafood depending on the day, the short food menu here is more than enough to satisfy. There is a fair amount of meat-based dishes on the menu - after all, Asians actually do eat a lot of animal products regularly. The cuisine here is Asian Fusion and I can vouch for all the flavors. Your tastebuds are definitely in for a treat regardless of what you order, so prepared to be surprised by unique takes on classic East Asian dishes, e.g. mapo tofu, bibimbap, with unconventional textures and presentations.   I was very pleasantly surprised by the mapo tofu vegetarian dish tonight! Crispy tofu with veggies and lots of peanuts generously dressed with a \"creamy\" hot sauce with a slight Sichuan peppercorn burn, tip- it's really not that spicy! I looooved the texture and rich flavor medley for this dish. It's not very large, so probably better as a side dish or appetizer. The vegetarian hot stone bibimbap was also very yummy, but more generic for sure. I loved how they actually served black rice rather than purple rice, which is basically white rice plus a small % of black rice for the color. Black rice is healthier than white rice for sure and has a chewy nuttiness to it. Otherwise this dish is not super memorable besides how big it is! For $18 you are definitely a lot of food.  The reason why I gave 3/5 stars is mainly because I think this restaurant still has a lot of potential. Tonight was my 3rd night here. I think there used to be a lot more hype, but the sometimes lackluster food (changing menu) and possibly pricing turned some people away. I'm interested to see how this restaurant will continue to grow, will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here during a rainy night for Winterlicious. The staff are lovely and very welcoming.   We tried their popular CSB (Cha Siu Bao) and the pastry was so light and tasty as it fresh from the oven (it's baked) and the inside was just enough saltiness in the meat.  We got Korean Chicken Skewers (Gochujang, sesame, scallion) and BBQ Pulled Pork Croquettes (Russet potato, gong bo sauce, kewpie mayo) as our appetizer to start off. The croquettes came with a very interesting sauce that contained peppercorn, soy sauce, garlic, hoisin sauce and other interesting ingredients that made for a complex flavour. The skewers were good as well, nice and tender.  For our main, we got Tom Yum Ramen (Crispy pork belly, soft-boiled egg, galangal, lime) and Macanese Seafood Curry (Shrimp, scallops, haddock, cheong fun, toasted coconut), you have to ask for rice because it doesn't come with it. The egg was lovely and the pork belly had a delicious flavour with it's crispiness adding a nice texture. The seafood curry was pretty good, though we were so full from the ramen we couldn't finish it.   Now for dessert, we got the Lychee Panna Cotta (Macerated blackberries, housemade granola) and Coconut & Pandan Tart (Honeycomb, vanilla whipped cream). The blackberries paired really well with the soft, jiggly panna cotta and the granola gave it a nice crunch. The tart had a green inside which threw us off but the lightness of the tart pastry was phenomenal and the whip cream was very well done.  We also got their $7 cocktails, the La Chinesca and Tian Tian's Cold Buttered Rum. The tequila in the Chinesca was a little stronger than expected but still nice to drink. The toasted star anise was a bit too strong in fragrance in the Rum and I felt like I was drinking a glass of potpourri.  Overall I had a wonderful experience at R&D, the interior is quite unique with the graffiti-esque walls and abstract light fixtures. Noise is decent, you're still able to have a nice conversation without needing to strain your voice."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal yesterday at R&D. Had the octopus, spring rolls, lobster chow mein  and curry beef. Superlative  service.  Eric is full of potential."}
{"text":"The dishes were good, not super amazing, but the biggest thing you must come here for are the BBQ Pork buns.  So amazing and worth the trip alone here."}
{"text":"Located in the busy part of Chinatown but it is certainly different from the typical Chinese restaurants. The menu selection consists of a kind short list of fusion Asian dishes which draws inspirations from Chinese, Korean, Thai and a tiny bit of Japanese touch. The dishes here mainly want to illustrate good techniques given the status of both co-owners. For instance, the Pork short rib is sous vide for 15 hours and then grilled very lightly, certainly very tasty. The CSB (Char Siu Bao) is fantastic, instead of steaming the bao, they baked it with \"pineapple bao\" toppings, so the skins are soft but with crispy and sweet toppings, simply great.    However, the seafood noodles, on the other hand, is kind of a disaster. The seafood is very good, the noodles, on the other hand, is over cooked---- actually, not really overcooked, but just burnt, which gives it a bitter taste. Later on, I learned that they used chitarra noodles and they blanched it then stir-fried it. This technique is fine but requires the chef to have master command of the flames--- too hot, we have burnt noodles like mine, --- too cold, it becomes soggy. Most importantly, this just can't be intentional because it was done in an uneven way: about half is burnt and the other half is not.    In addition, the treatment of my comment is also not up to par. I suggested that it was burnt and the seafood is fine, they took the plate away with about a quarter of the seafood still in it. They came back with just a redone of noodles with no seafood. where did my shrimp and clams go? You don't have to replace the whole thing, but what about the ones you took away? In addition, the manager/host came to table and explained they blanch the chitarra noodles, which will result in a different flavor, and saying that a new plate might have the same problem. And the new dish was actually fine and I really do think they screwed up the first time. I can tell the difference between intention slightly overcooked and just simply burnt noodles.   The service is top notch, the waiter is very attentive to our needs and requests. Other than the burnt noodle part, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place a few times and wanted to try it out. I finally went with a group of friends and overall it was just ok.  It was not busy when we arrived around 7 on a weeknight so we were able to get a table without reservations. Note that it did pick up a bit after 8. The decor here is pretty cool. I really  liked the cylinders suspended from the ceiling and the dining area is fairly spacious.  The selection on the menu was decent and there were a fair number of dishes to choose from. We asked the waitress for recommendations and went with the beef tataki and seafood chow mein for mains as the chow mein was supposed to be a take on the winning dish for the chef during Masterchef Canada. We also had the fun guo and crispy pork belly bao for apps.  The chow mein was not bad but I didn't like the beef tataki. I don't know if it was me but I found it a little bland and it would not be something I would want to have here again. The bao was ok but I feel like I've had better at other restaurants. The item I liked most was the fun guo. It looked really flat and not too appealing when it first came out but it was delicious when I tasted it so definitely recommend it. For dessert we also tried the mango panna cotta which was fairly decent.  Service wise the waitress came by every so often to check on us so definitely no complaints in that regard.  Overall I thought R&D was ok. I expected more from the food and left a little disappointed. I may come back in the future to have the duck and more of the appetizers."}
{"text":"I think I went in with too high expectations. Overall the experience was okay, but not great. Our server was friendly and helpful, but the food was a bit of a disappointment. It was good but each dish could have been better. For example the beef in the beef curry was a bit fatty as if the fat hadn't been cut off properly. The pork in the pork buns was grainy and chewing in places and seemed to be very low quality. The flavour was there, but I was just expecting better quality. The Brussels sprouts with Black bean sauce was delicious but the size of the dish was huge and misleading because it was on the small list. That isn't a bad thing but I wish we had been warned since it was so much of one thing and very salty as black bean sauce can be. The drink menu was great - I had an awesome ginger and bubbly cocktail. I probably wouldn't return but I also wouldn't refuse to go if someone really wanted to."}
{"text":"I was excited to come to this place with my friend to try some star chef food. It was disappointing.. The drinks were not great, the food had strange smells and after tastes to it and the chicken was EXTREMELY salty! The chicken did taste good but just wayyy too much salt. I also have never experienced numbing of the tongue while eating szechuan food, whatever it was.. it happened to my friend too and we're not allergic to anything.  It was the weirdest experience and the hype is not worth it. Is there even a hype for this place anymore? Anyways.. very disappointing."}
{"text":"R&D is an Asian fusion restaurant opened by Masterchef Canada winner Eric Chong!! Just this fact alone, I was already super excited to come to this restaurant to try it out.  Unfortunately, although the atmosphere is fantastic, the food is not as good as I had expected.  I came to this place twice, once with a group of 5 people and another time with a colleague.  The first thing that caught my eyes in this restaurant is the wall painting of Mr. Mao at the back, although interesting, I wasn't feeling for having Mr. Mao staring down at me while I eat.  If you know some Chinese history, you may know why.  Food wise, in my two visits, I tired the Shrimp Toast, CSB, Little Dragon Buns (both flavours), poutine, octopus, shiitake polenta fries, chili crab bibimbap, general sanders' chicken, palm sugar creme brulee and the pina colada bubble tea.  I have to say, most of the food I tried only tasted so-so and I will highlight a few that really impressed me and disappointed me.  First off the good stuff, CSB - This is by far the BEST CSB (cha siu bao) I ever had in my life, CSB are made fresh every batch and you MUST eat it as soon as it comes out.  The bread was so soft and the fillings inside were so good.  I also like that fact they baked the top of the CSB similar to how typical Chinese bakery would baked their \"Mexico Buns\".  Octopus - This was also another dish that impressed me, it's the fact the octopus tentacles were grilled to perfection and easy to chew on that really impressed me.  The two sauces pairing were also very interesting.  Now the so-so, General sanders' chicken - Hong Kong style egg waffle with fried chicken is an interesting concept, unfortunately, the HK style egg waffle lacks the texture and the fried chicken didn't taste that special.  Little Dragon Buns - The fillings were good, but the dough that wraps it was WAY too thick.  Would I come back again?  Properly not unless I am really feeling for another round of CSB which I think is the best item on their menu."}
{"text":"First of all, the restaurant is right beside TD bank. We passed by this restaurant without noticing the sign and went all the way to queen street. They should add lights make a bigger sign because at night its hard to see the sign of this restaurant.  When we walked in the restaurant was not busy at all because there was storm going outside. I really liked the decor of the restaurant. You can see the chefs who are preparing your food. That is something i always like to watch  I ordered the the cauliflower curry!! To me,  its the best cauliflower i had in my life!! It was served in those hot stone pots and the was still boiling!! The cauliflower was cooked just right, had a little bit of crunch to it. They also give little bit of pasta at the bottom. That pasta would actually melt in mouth. I do wish they served steamed rice with it..   I would definitely recommend everyone to visit this restaurant and I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Delicious! I came here last friday and really enjoyed the dishes. We asked our server for her suggestions so we ordered the pork buns, tuna tartare, veggie bibimbap, and the sweet and sour pork. The best part was the tuna tartare.... fresh tuna, delicious drizzle of sauce on top, the perfect combo. The pork buns are a close second, they were fantastic but they only have a limited quantity available so make sure to get there not too late! The other 2 was perfect to share, some pork with a side of rice. Would come back here again! They also have a good gin and tonic for $7."}
{"text":"We have been looking forward for some time to try R&D Restaurant in Toronto.   After all, it's not everyday one eats food prepared by a MasterChef Canada winner: Chef Eric Chong!   Although we live in California, we are from Toronto and followed Eric's rise to the top as Canada's 1st winner.  We got the whole family together and the nine of us sat down in the very eclectic restaurant in Toronto's Chinatown.  With so many people, it really gave us a chance to sample a large number of the dishes (and a few cocktails, too!).  In our experience, most restaurants have one or two dishes that are outstanding with far fewer having most of their menus in the superb range, but at R&D I can honestly say EVERY dish was out of this world!  The CSB (Char Siu Bao) are to die for, the chow mein fantastic, and ... well, basically we were blown away with each of the 9-10 dishes we sampled.  If you haven't been to R&D Restaurant, even if you are not from Toronto, make plans to go there.  You won't be disappointed.  Thank you, Eric, for dropping by our table and posing for, probably, your one millionth photo.  You are a 5-star chef and we wish you and your restaurant all the very best!  We'll be back again next time we're in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this brief because this place isn't worth too many words.   DECOR: Gorgeous  FOOD: Meh  SERVICE: Snarky  PRICE: Way overpriced for the food and the service but I guess they have to pay for all the fancy decor  LOWEST POINT OF THE MEAL: On the menu, it says the Pork Baos were made every hour. The snarky server said that they only make it when there are enough customers. I guess a table of 7 does not constitute enough customers. We wanted to order the Chicken and Waffles. The snarky server said that the waffle maker was broken so they will just add extra chicken. We expressed our continued disappointment that again what we wanted wasn't available. Snarky server says \"WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ORDER IT!\". That sealed our impression of this place.    OVERALL: Pass on this. This place is essentially lipstick on a pig."}
{"text":"So recently I had written another review about this place - mostly about the disappointing service that I had receive there. Namely, the fried chicken I had sent back due to the pink color on the inside was not replaced, but reheated, and the meat became dry. At this restaurant with this level of pricing I thought that kind of service was unacceptable. I also named a few other menu items that didn't meet my expectations.  but I was not at all ready for the pure awesomeness that followed my review.  Apparently my review had caught the attention of Robin, the store's general manager, who had messaged me inquiring further about my experience. I then proceeded to write a longer email to him explaining my thoughts on the situation and the service and menu items that I thought needed improvement.   Not only did he answer all of my questions and concerns thoroughly, he sincerely apologized for the experience I had last time, and re-invited me to eat with a friend at his restaurant. on the house.  He sat us at the chef's rail and personally introduced many dishes to us, and what he liked about each one. He talked about the painstaking process of trying to develop each dish, and how each menu item had gone through 4-5 steps of refinement before they thought it would be acceptable for the public palate. He gave us his thoughtful and insightful opinions on why he thinks the quality of food served at R&D is superior to many other restaurants that sell similar food for less, and even took us on a tour to the back of the restaurant, and showed me how they hand made the noodles in the lobster chow mein. We toured the cellar and saw all of their supplies and where they dried the peking duck. Everything was clean, and they really did use the best ingredients. Apparently one bag of smoked plums, directly shipped from Hong Kong, costs the restaurant 150 dollars. He explained in detail why he thinks the price point of the restaurant is fair given the quality of the raw materials and amount of energy and effort put into the preparation. He asked us for further feedback on the dishes that we had that night.  Just to inform you we had:  the lobster chow mein scallops the octopus the ceviche  and 2 oysters  all were very fresh and well made. Our favourite was the ceviche - we loved how the avocado puree really complimented the citrus in the dish.   yes we got greedy and got 3 desserts: the smoked milk ( which is our favourite - I understand the taste may not be for everyone but I loved the smoked woody taste paired with the ice cream and pastry, it felt like I was in the wilderness and sitting by a camp fire), the banana split and the creme brûlée. All of which were fantastic.  The service was fantastic, and the waitress thanked us for giving their restaurant a second chance, and hoped to see us again.   Now you may read this and think that I'm a sell out -and hey, I do admit I like free stuff-  but I never thought that my grumpy review would gain the attention of the restaurant, and the fact that they apologized and gave us a free meal is a level of service that I have not personally experienced. and I'm only a lowly average rater who's checked in at like 2 places in the past year. I really appreciated how seriously they've taken my concerns and tried to change my opinion about their place. And just for that, I give them 5 stars in this review. I also found the food to be fantastic the second time. I guess dining is really about the experience, and service does play a large part in that. I thought the food was awesome this time around though, don't get me wrong.  Thanks so much to the staff at R&D for making our night!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here last night and were pleasantly surprised by how smoothly run and amazing the food was , especially since it has recently opened.  The space itself has a cool open loft feel - beautiful hard-wood plank flooring and exposed brick walls. The seating was comfy and there was a small bar area as well. The restaurant is worth a visit for the ambiance and cocktails alone, but the food was stellar.   We had the dim sum (Tom yum chicken), polenta fries, scallops, and lobster chow mien for our starters/main. Everything came out well paced, warm and delicious - well flavored and not overwhelming. Dessert was a hit as well - Creme brûlée and malted milk balls.   The only disappointment of the night was the scallops. They were delicious but I could have eaten a couple more ... Especially for the price ($23 for 2).  Overall, I would definitely go back (minus an order of scallops)."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant FIVE TIMES in the FIVE WEEKS this place has opened. I have had one mediocre experience (my most recent one), because my favourite server Morgan was not working - if you have him serve you, your night will be made.  My favourite thing on on the menu is the Ceviche - i find every opportunity to have it, as long as the other person I'm eating with does not have any objections to raw seafood.  The CSBs are so taste and freshly made - it's a mix of BBQ bun and Pineapple bun - two staples that a Chinese family loves after a long day of work.  The Colonel Sanders Chicken is juicy, and while I wish the Egg waffles were freshly made, the sauce you dip it in makes all the difference.  The Chop Suey (Veggie wraps) are no longer on the menu, but it may be a good thing, given the time it took to prepare, and I found it lacking flavour and depth. The other thing I was not a fan of was the steak tartare... there was a heavy mayo-flavoured base that was a major turnoff - you couldn't really enjoy the meat.  The main dishes (crab bimbipap and lobster chow mein) - you have to try at least once... both have their pros and cons... mostly pros so make sure to add it to your list of must-eats.  Lastly - end your night with a dessert - the creme brulee is worth sharing and the sour cherry sorbet is a perfect compliment... if only I can try their smoked milk.....   There's always next week :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Nice and cozy ambiance. The food is to die for.  We ordered their Cbs, pork and the jerk buns, both were good. We also had their pecking duck and it was delicious. One of the staff came by and showed us the duck and explained the process on how it was made (which was neat). We also had the chicken and waffles. It was good from the first Bite to the last. Long beans were pretty good too. We're already planning our next visit. No wonder he won the master chef Canada!"}
{"text":"R&D is another Asian-fusion joint with slick decor and multicultural-friendly service. Came for a three-course Winterlicious meal and thoroughly enjoyed all of it - though it was nothing spectacular. I'd recommend the braised beef with coconut rice, or the seafood curry. The pana cotta dessert is worth a try as well. Beware - their cocktails are TINY (3-4 shots worth) and not worth the prices."}
{"text":"R&D is opened by Masterchef Canada's winner, Eric Chong, and the demon chef, Alvin Leung. We came here with high expectations but unfortunately, the hype was waaay too high.. Service was okay.  DRINKS: Mai Mai (Cocktail)  CSB (3/5) (char siu, mexican topping) The cha siu bao was pretty good - we started off great!! One thing that needs improvement is the char siu. By itself, it didn't have enough taste and was a bit dry. If it was marinated more, it would've made the bao (bun) even better.  FOIE GRAS TORCHON (2/5) (five-spice, plum honey, sesame crackers, green apple gastrique) I did not know this was a pâté until the dish came.. D: I'd prefer sautéed foie gras of course! We gave this a try and didn't like it.. hahaha...  ROASTED EGGPLANT (2/5) (thirteen-spice garlic butter, pine nuts, cilantro) The eggplant has no taste and wasn't soft. The garnish was separate from the eggplant itself and did not have much taste to it as well. My friend didn't finish it even though she usually likes eggplant dishes.  PORK TENDERLOIN (2/5) (sweet miso, ginger spätzle, applewood cheddar) We were surprised at how soft the pork was! It was good until we ate more.. There was no taste in the pork, it really required the sauce for flavouring. The sauce wasn't very tasty either. We thought the dish was garnished with fried eggs at the bottom of the tenderloin but it was actually applewood cheddar.. lol.. It sure tasted like fried eggs haha (with no salt!).  BEST DUCK IN THE CITY (2/5) (whole roasted pekin duck, roasted garlic hoisin, cucumber, leeks, pancakes) My friends and I were trying to accept the fact that this is \"fusion Chinese food\".. but we'd recommend saving the money and going to a Chinese restaurant for some authentic peking duck for half of R&D's price D:  On the plus side, the demon chef was there that day! His blue hair is definitely what caught our eye to spot him out from the crowd!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to hate this place.  I was not a fan of Eric's while watching Master Chef Canada. His food changed my mind.   We tried several items but the bibimbap stole the show for me.  I actually was contemplating offing a second one for take away.  It went great with a Sapporo but could have easily worked with 3 AM cold tea or a spicy cesar  for Sunday brunch.   Other notable items were the venison spring rolls and cauliflower curry.   I'd definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love R&D! From the cocktails, the service, to the highlight of the meal - the duck, everything was excellent. You have to try the CSB, delicious. Grandpa's Fun GAO, to die for. Then the duck, the duck was perfection, the best thing you will ever eat."}
{"text":"I was cautious going into this restaurant because I had read divisive reviews online. However, I have to say, I was very very satisfied with the food, service, and ambiance. Nothing blew me away but in general, I would be happy to come back and enjoy some good food.   The best dish I had here was the Brussels Sprouts w/ sausage, bean sauce, and nuts - this was amazing. I know it's no longer mindblowing to eat enjoyable brussels sprouts but i regularly cook them for myself and these blew me away.   The ceviche dish was also fantastic, although I'm definitely biased towards enjoying ceviche, and the service was cheerful and put up with our banter. The meal was definitely not cheap but I will come back if I can find a way to put it on the company card!"}
{"text":"DRINKS:  We asked for water and then our waitress asked us if we wanted tap or sparkling water. When someone asks for water they generally mean tap water, and if someone wanted bottled water then they would ask for bottled water or perrier water, etc. I had a feeling that sparkling water was at a charge and the waitress was trying to get us to spend, and I was correct - I read an earlier review that stated someone asked for sparkling water under the assumption that it was free (since a lot of restaurants actually provide sparkling water for free), but then they got charged.  FOOD:  For appetizers we ordered the ebiyaki (4pc $10) and potstickers (5pc $8). The ebiyaki is some sort of shrimp ball that I did not actually eat but my friends had nothing negative to say about it. The potstickers however were like pulled pork dumplings that had nothing special to it. It was just crispy with pulled pork inside of it, accompanied by a soya vinegar sauce to lightly dip into. It was mediocre - quality similar to dumplings you can order at any all you can eat sushi place. 6/10  For our vegetable dish, we ordered the brussels sprouts that came with chinese pork sausage in a black bean sauce ($12). The dish had flavor and I enjoyed it. It was also a decent size for the price. Nothing over the top, but I could eat it. 7/10  For main course we decided to order the peking duck ($65) which has been slowly cooking/prepping for 72 hours. The duck itself I must say was delicious. There were plentiful pieces of meat, which some peking duck places lack. The meat was also tender, flavorful and had a nice pink colour to it. Some peking duck lacks flavor and are dry. The amount of duck meat that was brought out, they only gave us 4 small pancakes to share between 4 girls. Not only that, the peking duck here was only accompanied with cucumber and not lettuce like most places do so we didn't even have lettuce to use if we ran out of pancakes. I was confused at what they expected us to do with 4 pieces of pancakes and a plate full of duck meat. We thought nothing of this - we just asked for more pancakes like we usually do at other places. They brought out more, which we quickly finished and asked for more again. This was unfortunate because the pancakes took awhile to come out and at that point our hunger was subsiding. They should be bringing out a plate FULL of pancakes and not just with 4 pieces. We also asked for more sauce and cucumbers because that was so minimal, it got used up quickly. 9/10  DESSERT:  Dark Chocolate Brownie: My girlfriends got me this as a surprise with a candle on top. It was a decent sized piece of brownie with ginger flavored ice cream on top and blueberry sauce. The brownie was surprisingly hard on the outside and that took away from the inside which was slightly softer. The ginger ice cream wasn't pleasant either, not too sure if many people are fond of ginger ice cream - I personally don't like ginger so the flavor itself for me was a no, especially there being small pieces of ginger inside the ice cream. 5/10  Coconut Baklava: So these were square pieces of layers of pastry with nuts in between them - one word: hard. You couldn't even bite into these, you had to tear them apart to be able to eat them. The peanut butter ice cream also tasted weird. The only thing I liked was the top layer which was coated with sugar. 4/10  Ice Cream: We got one scoop green tea and one scoop coconut ice cream. The coconut ice cream tasted like perfume. Thankfully the green tea ice cream was splendid - if that went bad, I don't even know what to say.. 10/10 for the green tea ice cream.  SERVICE:  After dining at this restaurant and coming back here to read the reviews, I would agree with the majority. The waitresses lack passion and don't make you feel welcoming. It's like they just want their shifts to end. 6/10  OVERALL:  Once we received our bill, we saw that we got charged for the extra pancakes AND the sauce for the peking duck.. Wait, you charge $2 for more sauce? $2 can get you a bottle full of sauce at the supermarket.. and then $2 for each set of pancakes? Every other peking duck place gives unlimited pancakes.  I think this place is just out to STEAL your money in every way possible. With the sparkling water.. I think it's only courteous if the waitress informed us that there would be an extra charge for additional pancakes - although it's quite ridiculous to charge for pancakes. The \"chef\" should know what it's like to eat peking duck.  The feeling that this place just wants to cheat money from you makes me give this place a 2 star. If it weren't for the tender duck, I would rate this 1 star. Also, near the end of the night, the place got empty but nobody was even present to say goodbye to us...  I don't write reviews, but I felt that people deserved to know that this place isn't really what the hype puts it out to be. There's more to \"Master Chef Canada\" then what people believe."}
{"text":"TO BE FAIR: I wish i could have done 2.5 star.  Now the review.... Looking for dinner reservations on a saturday for 7:00 seemed like a nightmare.  Every where was booked, but this place...should have been a warning sign.  Found the place easily right in chinatown.  Pretty empty at 7 pm. Got in before happy hour cocktails was over. 7.00 for a drink before 7.00.  had a gin and tonic type....and that was good.  So when we go to new restaurant to try, we hate making decisions....usually we ask the waiter to bring us 4 or so of there most popular dishes or his fav.  Our waiter was useless.  He litterly named everything on the menu.  We asked opinions and got pretty much oh thats good. thats my fav.    So we settled for : CSB buns, Tuna Tartar, the quail risotto, and the short ribs.  POSITIVES: the CSB buns was good! loved the fried dough.  the short ribs were very tender Negatives:  the tuna tartar, was way to smokey...we thought it had coffee in it almost.  Also to much things going on, flavors everywhere.    The Rissotto....cold, felt over done, just not good at all.  3 drinks, and hte meal, bill was 150ish.  The Ambiance was nice though of this place.  Just nothing about this place was good.  If our waiter was better, probably 3 stars?  He was never really around after our original order.  And probably the most useless unhelpful waiter ever."}
{"text":"Only commenting on the drinks at the bar for I went after work to meet a friend. They have drinks for $7 between 5-7pm.  The bartender Sarah was nice and personable and created an interesting and tasty drink. Not too busy so noise level is not that loud so good when you are trying to talk and not yell. Would go back again and try some food to judge for myself."}
{"text":"1st time writing as an Elite member.  So glad to have tried and sample R&D during its first week of opening.  This is not an ordinary Chinese food restaurant, you really need to love the creativity and concept behind the menu.  Both Demon Chef (Alvin Leung 3 stars Michelin Chef) and Eric Chong (winner of MasterChef Canada season one) has a passion in merging Cantonese cuisine with Canadian food.  The General Sanders' Chicken is a must!  Serve with HK favourite egg waffle, maple syrup and Kung Pao sauce.  The CSB (BBQ pork bun) is baked with flaky top and tender pork, only available after 6pm.  Definitely not as affordable as restaurants down the street but is an unforgettable meal that the extreme taste stays in your mind.  Chef du Cuisine Nelson Tsai is also a great addition to the restaurant!  PS-amazing cocktail list with Peking Duck infused whisky & black garlic + Chinese mushroom vodka & oolong gin.....what a great idea for east meets west!"}
{"text":"Service is great, but I found the food pretty blah overall. That said, the pork buns are Too Die For.   Accessibility: restaurant has steps but has an elevator on the left by the main entrance. Washrooms are gender neutral and on the main floor, but likely not big enough to fit a wheelchair in and turn around in it with enough space."}
{"text":"Came by after creeping on Instagram with a friend. The menu, the photos looked great! Venue, music, vibe, service; 4 stars! Food - don't bother.   I ordered a thai basil bourbon smash. My basil looked sad, it made me sad. It was just wilted with some brown spots. While the drink was fine, (on the sweet side for those who don't like it sweet) ... for that price you expect them shell out a dollar for a bunch of fresh thai basil or don't serve it at all with the garnish.   We ordered the fried chicken with donut. I would personally rather have used my calorie quota for KFC or Popeyes. The chicken was so dry, the batter was nothing special. Cronut - really? Do you really know what a cronut is? It was small, greasy, the only things it had in common with a cronut would be it's carbs and its round shape. We end up eating a bit of the chicken ,wash it down with a bite of cronut, it was a vicious cycle. We didn't want it but we didn't want to waste it.   Total regret wasting a meal here. We cheer ourselves up by finding a better meal elsewhere right after."}
{"text":"I am BAFFLED that this place only had 3 stars. The food and service was amazing from start to finish and the cost of the items were totally reasonably priced for the quality and value in my opinion.  First tip: put in a reservation because it isn't the biggest place so it looks like it could get busy very quickly.  Our waitress was amazing at recommendations and we arrived during happy hour. Drinks are generally 14 dollars but they are half price during happy hour and TRUST ME the amount of alcohol and thought out into each drink is worth the cost. I would go for the margarita and the plum wine drink as my first options!  Now the food, our waitress offered to course out the food and I've never been told they could do that before and she did it so well.  We started off with the char siu bao. I make my own and anyone that does knows it can be tricky to get the pork right. And this was SOOOOOOOOO GOOD. It's the BEST CSB I've ever had. Period. It wasn't traditional but perfect nonetheless. Next was the scallop ceviche and the haddock mousse. Scallop ceviche was amazing as expected but this haddock mousse was confusingly amazing. No one would think lemon jello on a fish mousse would be good but trust me and do it and don't ask questions . The glass noodles were next and the vegetables were done perfect, and dressing was on point! It was a little heavier so the dressing ran to the bottom so just be sure to mix a little better than you think. Last was our sous-vide pork Kalbi ribs. Oh my god. I don't know how to explain how great the sauce was. And it was on a bed of Korean rice cakes. Just trust me come here and you'll have an amazing time."}
{"text":"First time here on WED night.  At the door, no one greeted us until the bartender saw us waiting inpatiently at the door.  Once we were at the table, the server did not come for at least 5 min and also no water.  There's decent amount of selection on the menu and also drink menu is on the back.  We decided to get the CSB, GRANDPA'S FUN GUO, SWEET & SOUR PORK RIBS and GENERAL SANDERS' CHICKEN.  CSB-this is baked every hour and the waitress did told us about this and it came at the end of the meal.  For $8, you get a serving of 2 buns.  This is baked version with cha siu inside.  It's nice to have it hot straight from the oven but there's nothing special about it.  $8 for 2 in my opinion is just too expensive.  GRANDPA'S FUN GUO-For $8, you get 3 pcs.  The dumpling suppose to have black truffle inside.  As soon as I cut it in half, I can smell the strong truffle smell but couldn't really able to identify the truffle.  The unique about this dish is probably just the truffle but you can pretty much get better fun guo at any chinese dim sum place for fraction of the price.  SWEET & SOUR PORK RIBS-this was rather good.  We order half rack for $13.  Many would complain about being the small portion, but being baby back rib, the portion is what you will get in any other places.  The price for this dish is about right.  The rib is deep fry just like the sweet and sour pork that you get in chinese restaurant.  It came with slaw and some pineapple.  The slaw is rather sour but together with the sweetness of the ribs is about just right.  This dish is tasty and good value in my opinion.  GENERAL SANDERS' CHICKEN-the last is the chicken and waffle, asian style.  The waffle is the tradtional chinese street waffle. The flavor was good with the maple syrup but too bad it was burnt making it very dense in texture.  Normally this should be crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside.  About the chicken, it came with 5 pcs but I think we got one extra.  They are all boneless and I believe is a mix of dark and white meat but more of the dark meat.  Again this was overcooked.  Burnt on the outside and a bit dry on the inside.  The portion is good and great value at $25.  The sauces that came with it was very unique.  Last thing to note that the food came out very quickly.  In matter of fact, they all came out at the same time filling up the table.  I would rather they came one at a time.  Overall, this was an average place, I will come again once they improve on the quality of the food and adjust their prices."}
{"text":"I love the food here and service is usually great but I just encountered the weirdest situation at the bar there. I went in at 5pm for their 5-7 drink special. It might have been 4:59. I sat at the bar and the bartender told me they were closed. I asked how they could be if they had a 5-7 special and she just said \"oh well actually there just isn't food\". I just left- I don't know why she was so reluctant to serve me but she was definitely trying to get rid of me/ avoid serving me."}
{"text":"Great decor and trendy vibe.  Food was good but their house dishes like the Lobster chow mein didn't blow me away.  I didn't follow Master Chef Canada so thaat angle didn't have the same appeal to me.  Was def pricey for dishes we were being served."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious! The flavours, oh my goodness. My boyfriend and I went for Valentine's Day and had the jerk chicken buns, the grandpa's fun guo, the chicken satay with peanuts and their R & D fried rice. Although the dishes we chose were small portions, we got to taste a little bit of everything and still ended up being satisfied (I ended up going back for lunch on my own between classes the next day spending the same amount...). The atmosphere is extremely cool. During valentine's day it was a lot of Motown and love songs from the era when labels and people had high standards. Other times when I'd drop in for some drinks with classmates old school Hip-Hop would be playing. I mean high quality late 80s early 90s Hip-Hop, again, back when labels and people had high standards. Music that makes you think and feel and still cruise along and enjoy yourself. On top of that there are always kung-fu movies playing in the background! This restaurant is heavenly, I tell you. We came back the next month for my sister's birthday and went for the larger meals, the braised beef was incredible. There was a cold beef plate, I forget what it's called, and I wasn't a fan of it but it didn't matter because we all shared plates. I liked the beef my bf had and he liked the one I had. Try to go when the bartender named Blake is there. His custom cocktails are incredible and it is always cool to see things be lit on fire. You will find that the chefs and Blake (I haven't been there when there was another bartender) truly understand flavours. Everyone there is extremely talented and know what they're doing. Master chefs. Even though it is pricey, you get what you pay for and I had to hold myself back from becoming a frequent customer because man oh man, you can go and spend $30-50 alone easily. AND OH MY GOODNESS THE BROWNIE WITH THE GINGER ICE CREAM IS ONE OF THE BEST PARTS. I definitely must go in later on today."}
{"text":"Headed out for mid-week dinner and was happy to find a lot of tables available. I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 3 because the staff was amazing.  Very attentive and personable.  Our waitress made all the right suggestions.  The food:  It was good but not extraordinary.  Would I go back... yes, run back... no. The highlights were the dumplings, ribs and ceviche. I was not crazy about the curry (and I love curry) and shrimp brioches.  All in all the decor is really nice, great staff and good food.  You will not go wrong here, but don't expect MasterChef."}
{"text":"Probably the best place I've eaten all year! Had the octopus, lamb buns, aromatic 5-grain rice and general chicken. It was all amazing and delicious! I'll be back soon to try more things..."}
{"text":"I was drawn to this restaurant for two things - their CSB (bbq pork buns) and General Sander's Chicken. I must say I was quite disappointed. I might have had some sort of higher hope because the two faces of this restaurant are supposed to be quite impressive.   CSB - Very good. If you've been to Tim Ho Wan in Hong Kong, it's ALMOST that good. It's a baked bbq pork bun that's good as it's going to get as far as bbq pork buns go. It has a delicious topping like baked pineapple buns minus the pineapple. BUT it is SO overpriced here, much like everything else. $8 for 2 buns...I would come here just for the buns if they were more affordable.   Little Dragon Buns - We tried both the spicy sichuan lamb and the chicken tom yum. I quite enjoyed the latter as it was something different than what I'm used to in terms of soup buns but it's $7 for 3...I mean, it's not THAT good and there wasn't a lot of soup in it. Also, you can't add extra even though this is supposed to be a tapas restaurant... our server told us before we could even ask. I did not like the lamb but that's my bias because it's very heavy in its lamb flavour.  General Sander's Chicken - The long awaited fried chicken and HK egg waffle... after my friend sent me the picture they had on their Instagram, I knew I needed to try this restaurant. It was unfortunately for us, a MAJOR FAIL. When the dish arrived at our table, it did not have the HK egg waffle but instead, ye olde regular waffle... WTF? Oh... their machine broke and they're using the same batter, etc, etc. but no one ever told us when we ordered. Bait and switch much? I mean, thanks for the apology, but that doesn't give me HK waffle or my money back... The waffle arrived cold - ANY frozen waffle would have been better, or run to Dragon City, they make the best bubble waffles there. The chicken was good, well fried and flavoured. From what we could taste, it was a bit of five-spice and char siu. I wonder if I can create the same thing with shake and bake (seriously). The sauces that came with this dish was not good, some watery syrupy thing and some brown sauce thing. $25 for half a waffle and 4 pieces of chicken - nothing like their Instagram.   Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs - These were good. Probably the most satisfying thing we ordered that night. They had a nice orange flavour to them and they were crispy. It was served with some pineapple chunks and some pineapple slaw. $25 for a full rack.   Lobster Chow Mein - I very much did not like this. It was very poorly executed and very expensive. The portion is small. You get a couple pieces of lobster. I can run down the street and get a whole lobster for that price, it would've tasted better too. They use chitarra noodles, I did not like them. It was hard... not al dente. The sauce for the noodles was too gingery and I did not like the pieces of lemon, it did not work for me. $25.   I doubt I will be returning... unless I have some MAJOR craving for the CSB because it's still cheaper than a flight to HK. The atmosphere is nice and the servers were polite. We were a party of four and you would need more food for a full dinner but we gave up and went somewhere else because all in all, it was not worth it. Plus, you're in Chinatown, there is an abundance of better food all around you."}
{"text":"Overall, I have a great experience at R&D. I didn't know about the Masterchef hype going in so I had no expectations for it to live up to...  My dinner companion and I ordered the following:  ceviche    -spot & tiger prawns, bay scallops, daikon, \"jolo\" butter octopus    -chargrilled, choy sum chimichurri, \"yu heung\" eggplant lobster chow mein    -wok fried lobster, chitarra noodles brussels sprouts    -black bean butter, puffed rice  I can honestly say it was all delicious, the service was really top notch and it had a cool decor as well.   I would like to go back with a bigger group and try their platter offerings..."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Very over priced. We went with a large group, 18% gratuity - ok sure but then the staff was asking the table for additional tips so they wouldn't have to make change."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious dinner one night. I was surprised that I was able to get reservations on the night of. It was quite busy when we got there. Our server was also the bartender which turned out to be a good thing. I asked if they had lemonade and he made me a lemon spritzer!!  We ordered off both the summerlicious and the regular menu. We got the scallop ceviche, crab siu mai, pulled pork pot stickers, torched salmon belly, buckwheat waffles and mango Panna cotta.  Everything was quite good but the stand outs were the scallop ceviche and the buckwheat waffles.   The restaurant has a cool vibe to it. Our server was attentive without being overbearing. The food was good all around. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend because of MasterChef Canada Eric. I think the food was good overall, unique flavours I hadn't tasted before so that's a big plus. On the other hand, I do think that the food is still slightly overpriced for what you get. I'd consider this place a restaurant I'd go to just to try some unique dishes every once in a while. The ambiance is nice too if you're into dimly lit atmosphere."}
{"text":"Balls! The friggin dish of fried chicken with mini donuts are the best! The fried chicken is on par with Popeyes and donuts are better than Tims. But you know what I think their seafood chow mien are not as good as those from Manchu Wok :) :) :) :)  And yahhhh they have Jackie Chan's movie omgggggggg but I wish they have the sound on.   :( :( :(   Overall a decent shit place :) :) :)"}
{"text":"Tried the Lobster Chow Mein, and the BBQ Pork Buns. With out a doubt, the bbq pork puns were the best in all of existence, but the Lobster Chow Mein didn't really exceed to that \"wow\" factor."}
{"text":"Every other review speaks about who the owners are and the story of Rebel & Demon so I will skip the intro and get right down to it. The food is truly fusion and innovative. If that is a good thing or a bad thing as far as concept I will leave up to you. Here is what was good: bibimbap and the Shrimp Toast (cubed shrimp on toast with cauliflower puree). The bibimbap was not special, but it was good. The Shrimp Toast was special and as simple as it sounds had the perfect sauce for it. The buns (lard and sugar) were so tasty but you have to feel terrible eating them just for the unhealthiness of it. The dumplings (CSB and fun gao) were so-so. The skin is thick so you know they are not very good and then they did not really have much of a taste or filling. What was really bad was the chao mein. It was not chao mein to begin with. The bitter taste stayed with me until this morning.  Overall, hit and miss. The restaurant was half full which is good for me because I dislike busy places and the price was high which I was not happy about because I could have eaten better dumplings at half the price if I walked across the street. OK let's face it not all of those places are sanitary. So there your choice. Oh I forgot, super nice waitress, hostess and manager. Helpful, friendly, genuine and actually could answer all our questions. Give them a raise and a good tip."}
{"text":"Take note that most of these dishes are tapa styles, meaning the portions are smaller. I really, really wanted to like this place as Eric was my favourite on Master Chef Canada, but my expectation felt short. The menu is definitely unique, but it was too overhyped and the majority of dishes didn't deliver. Also, the pricing is higher compared to other restaurants in the area, so I expected the quality of food to be reflect the premium paid. The service and ambience was nice, but I would suggest R&D as a restaurant for late-night snacks and drinks, as for dinner you might leave with a high bill and an ok-full stomach.   -Pina De Nada $7: tasted a bit watery, not much flavour going on. The tapiocas were stale and had no flavour, I think it would have been nice if they were soaked in syrup, giving it a little sweet taste.   -Lychee Cactus Pear Juice $6: I couldn't taste the cactus nor pear flavour, and this drink reminded me of the Lychee Aloe drink that you can buy at Asian grocery stores.  -CSB (BBQ pork buns) $8: instead of the steamed CSB, these were baked. This CSB has a perfectly crispy pastry encasing the delicious and tender BBQ pork. My complaint is that my server served the last fresh batch of the buns to the table next to me, whom ordered after. Also, I didn't know these took 1 hour to be made so she should have let me know in advance. Don't tell me it will take 10-20minutes when it supposed to take 1 hour. In the end I waited 2 HOURS for the CSB....  Although these were delicious, it was $8 for only 2 buns... If they were cheaper, I would have definitely come back just for these.  -grandpa's fun guo $9: Really good, the fillings were seasoned nicely with a hint of earthiness from the truffles.   -octopus $16: octopus pieces were grilled to perfection and wonderfully soft. The asian take on the chimichurri sauce was really good as well! It was refreshing and tangy with a hint of citrus, which brighten up the dish. By the way, I swear baked chicken skin is the new \"bacon\", you can just eat it on its own as a snack. While the octopus has little flavour, paired with the salty chicken skin and the chimichurri, it was just plain amazing. I normally don't like eggplant and for some reason I enjoyed it with this dish! The texture was almost like a mash, provided a hint of bitterness with all the components of the dish.  -beef tongue $16:I didn't enjoy this dish. For me the oysters and beef tongue didn't go well together and this dish lacked flavors. Albeit it is a bit spicy and the pickles were amazing, but the beef tongue were too dry and there wasn't enough sauce to rescue it.  -ceviche $18: I really like ceviche, but this dish didn't have that bright and refreshing taste of a ceviche. There was too much vinegar and the sauce was too creamy to enjoy.  -salmon belly $18: The salmon was really tender and flavorful, with a slight crispy skin. The rice was undercooked and cold, not warm, just stone cold... But the sauce was a bit sweet and not too salty, almost like a teriyaki sauce?  -crispy smoked milk $8: didn't enjoy it. I understand since it is smoked milk, you will definitely taste...the smoke... if you know what I mean. The smoke \"scent\" or \"taste\" was really strong that it lingers in my mouth in an unpleasant way, which gave the pastry a very bitter taste. In my opinion, if the chef used apple or other type of woods, it would have been better. The smoke will be more light and delicate, which wouldn't have overpowered the dish. The malted ice-cream and lemon zest left a refreshing aftertaste and helped to balance that bitter taste of the smoked milk."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful experience and the food was superb!  The ambience of R&D is a definite 5/5, and the serving staff go out of their way to make you feel welcomed. My friend and I shared the tuna tartare, CSB bao, and mac & cheese. Every dish was packed with flavour, and I honestly have a hard time describing which would be my favourite.  Price wise, the tuna tartare is a bit on the expensive side, but it's so delicious I'm willing to pay the money and order it again and again. The mac & cheese is a very generous portion and matched well with the price. The bao was different than I thought it would be, but of course was delicious.   Only odd thing was that they charged us $3.00 for \"filtered water\", which I thought was unnecessary (or at least they could have told us and we'd have ordered regular water...?)  Overall, a very pleasant experience with top notch food. Will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"I had a great Winterlicious lunch with 2 others at R&D recently; it was my 1st visit to the venue and I found the layout and decor to be quite interesting and unique.  All 3 courses of my meal were quite delicious and the ramen (my main dish) came with plenty of noodles.  Overall the meall was a pretty good deal for $18 and we were provided with quite friendly and prompt service."}
{"text":"We came here after seeing the restaurant on the current season of Master Chef Canada. We were a little disappointed that they do not feature Eric's winning dish, but there are plenty of other dishes to occupy our taste buds. The Brussels Sprout dish was AMAZING, the Grandpa fan guo was better than many dim sum restaurants. Of course, you can't miss the Laksa Seafood Fried Noodle and Bimbimbab. They are simply heavenly delicious! Our server is also very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Rebel and Demon...  Research and Development...  Rad and Deficient...  The ambiance is casual and loud.  Old rap music plays in the background as very perky and enthusiastic weight staff proudly summarize the menu.   The polarity in this restaurant's theme is also evident in the food. There were some good and not so good dishes.  I started with 510 caesar which had an Asian twist including mushroom infused vodka and a nori garnish.  It was smallish in volume so it didn't last very long.    The star was Eric's curry mainly because it was ingeniously different.  The sour and heat of the dish pushed the envelope as it would expect mosted dishes here to do.  The general sanders' chicken was also delicious. It was crispy outside and most in the middle.  The waffles were a nice touch but more a garnish than a key component of the dish.    The tom yum dragon buns could be better described as soup dumplings. The thai flavours were smart.    The beef tartare was an interesting twist on the traditional dish with the addition of the son in law egg.    The octopus was good. In particular, the choy sum chimichurri was quite intelligent.   I would expect nothing less than gimmickry for a place who's origin stems from a reality cooking show.  The CSB buns, which are as supposedly as  rare as a compliment from Alvin Leung himself, are made hourly and one can consider themselves lucky to score a pair.  The bread was amazing although the filling was a wee bit scarce.    One of the most expensive dishes on the menu is the lobster chow mein ($25).  It had a decent portion of the crustacean but was otherwise unremarkable and almost boring.  The scallop dish was unbalanced regardless of whatever combination of the greens, hollandaise or chili sauce I used.  It was too bitter and the heat wasn't balanced with anything. The scallops were not overdone but were missing the good sear I was hoping for.    In the end, it was a decent dining experience.  Prices were a little on the high side but to be expected given the celebrity status.  Eric may drop you a hello but like on the show, exhibits a methodical and stoic demeanor more indicative of an engineer than a flashy television chef.  Call it a weak 4 for a strong 3 depending on how much Alvin Leung irritates you."}
{"text":"I've walked by many times and sorta noticed it and been intrigued but never been inside.   I went with about 14-15 women on Sat Oct 29 th.  They kept our reservation even though we called to say we would be 20 mins late.   We had a great area in the back with 2 tables and benches on one side so we were able to squeeze a few extra people comfortably.   I was disappointed by my bao (bun) pork belly. Chewy and not much flavor. $6  I enjoyed the roasted eggplant my friends ordered as an appetizer. But it's best to be shared amongst 4-6 people rather than 2-3. Had a nice flavors and a crispy topping of some sort.   I was so so excited for the fried chicken and waffles only to be let down. The waffle batter was quite sweet, sweeter than I expected. The fried chicken has a nice crispy texture but soft and tender inside but it was also sweet. The portions of chicken were generous but only 2 waffle halves. I couldn't finish it and I shared some of. The texture of the waffles wasn't what I expected either - they were not light and fluffy and difficult to cut with my fork and knife.  The peanuts sprinkled on top were excessive and one small piece tasted rancid (the rest were fine).   For the chicken and waffles It all depends what flavored you're expecting. I wasn't expecting sweet atop sweet.   I also tried the sliced beef appetizer. Very generous portion but as the description says, you just get a lot of thinly sliced beef (cold dish). And if that's all you order, you get sick of it quite quickly.   The pork main dish with the German cheese pasta was okay my friend said. She was also full from snacking before the Resto. She couldn't finish if.   The curry cauliflower was yummy & nice and hot.   Don't go alone or even with 2 people as the real enjoyment will be going with at least 4 people and ordering 2 of the larger apps and only 2 main dishes only. I can't explain it, I just got sick of eating the one thing very quickly.   The waffle in the dessert is better as it is made with cornmeal so was a much nicer texture.   Service was good, our waiter came by often and only needed a few cues to bring us additional bottles of water. It was busy and we were a large party, so they explained our food would come out as it was ready which was fine with us.   The really nice thing about this place is that they do individual bills or shared bills (e.g. If 3 people shared something they can be on the same bill). AND they don't charge automatic gratuity (yet) on tables larger than 8! That was great!   My total bill came to about $30 (no alcohol) plus tax and tip. So almost $40/ person for 1 app and 1 main which isn't bad for the location.   Would I recommend to a friend? Unlikely unless they really enjoy Asian fusion and are going with a group with no dietary restrictions and are willing to share, etc...  Would I go back? No, too many other restaurants to try ;)"}
{"text":"Bland tasting, small portions and expensive.  Had lunch with two other friends here. We ordered Shrimp Toast, Poutine and the Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs. The server assured us that the plates would be more than enough for the three of us.  The Shrimp Toast was basically 3 small toasts with shrimp on top. \"13 dollars for 3 toasts\", we thought they would be substantial, but that was not the case. One bite each.  The main plate, Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs, were small but OK tasting. Nothing special. The pineapple ginger slaw that goes with it didn't quite fit the plate and none of us took more than a bite of it.  The Poutine was also (surprise) small: it had a few pieces here and there of food in the bowl. And, also, tasted bland.  The three of us agreed that every single item that we ordered was too expensive for the value (be it taste or substance) it provided us.  We left the place hungry and ended up getting some food to complement our lunch in another restaurant down the street."}
{"text":"Ended up here on a compromise with a friend. He was in the mood for something different and I really wanted to get some Chinese, so fusion it is. Ordered our way through many of the staples on the menu, including the fun guo, luksa, fried chicken, bibimbap, and the roasted eggplant. The dumplings were fantastic, the Luksa was a little disappointing and everything else was a little better than just fine. We enjoyed everything, but I think the only reason I would return is because I regret not ordering the duck."}
{"text":"This place was OK but I won't be headed back. We were underwhelmed by most of the meal. It started off great with the buns and spring rolls. Then came the mains which were average at best. The 'dish that won master chef' was pretty greasy and just not great. The chow mein had an off putting flavour and the 'waffles' with the fried chicken were not good at all. Sad because I had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Ate  here and the food and service were both amazing. Out of the ordinary Asian fusion. The food tasted fresh and original with decent sized portions.  Started off with some delicious oysters, then moved on to the chop suet. The ribs were amazing.  Good drink list also and the service was friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"There is probably no point to read a review on their food since they will just change their menu again in a few weeks.   But it was pretty bad, and the waitresses need to learn how to be better waitresses."}
{"text":"Got the sweet and sour pork which was yummy but didn't significantly wow me. It was a plate full of meat! I was hoping to pair the sweet and sour pork with some sides but there was only a tiny bit of coleslaw on the top. I eventually had to order white rice infused with coconut to go along with the pork.  The rice was sooooo good. One of the best rice over ever had! Very fine and coconutty.   I can't complain when there's a lot of pork but I suggest them to add some white rice on the side.   All in all, I didn't thought the sweet and sour pork was mediocre but I will definitely try their chicken and waffles next time!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a conference and took two of my colleagues here for dinner. Sat at the bar, which was fun. The bartender was super cool and knowledgable about the menu, both for food and cocktails. Shared a number of small and large plates. Chili Crab Sui Mai was a highlight and the fried rice was off the charts delicious. The Mac & Cheese with pulled pork was a little too decadent for me though my younger colleagues loved it. We shared a big plate of the Tom Yum Salmon - I am not a salmon fan at all but this was pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Overall pleasant dining experience but if you go in with high expectations of the food, you'll probably be disappointed. The pluses are attentive service, nice atmosphere and sometimes the owners are around too for the MasterChef. They also have a good amount of beers on taps especially for those who like IPAs.   The CSBs were definitely the highlight! The buns were crispy and flakey and the overall sweet and savoury dynamic worked well. The cronuts and chicken were also worth mentioning. The seafood chow mein was mediocre at best, it was a tad too spicy and there wasn't much other flavour besides that. The fun guos were also subpar, any proper dimsum restaurant would probably do a better job."}
{"text":"The decor is quite amazing.  That's where it ended.  The menu is very good however we were advised when we arrived (7pm reservation, so not late) that several items were not available due to then having run out. The pork buns were available but when we ordered them the waitress said she wasn't sure if we would get any if other tables ordered them too.   The pork ribs were ok.... Not spectacular.  Bland at best.  The chop Sui was a great concept but it was just a sweet bland slaw, nothing to write home about.  The lobster chow mein was good with a lot of large pieces of lobster.  It was the best dish we ordered but still underwhelming.   If there was a highlight I would say it was the egg roll appetizer.  Great flavour.  The pork buns were quite good as well.    Would I go back? Not likely.  I expected a far better experience considering the chef and all the press this restaurant has had, but it fell short of my expectations. Just my personal opinion without prejudice."}
{"text":"Went to R&D for Valentines Day and it was the best! Great food and atmosphere. Staff was super nice A++ Also got to watch Master chef Eric Chong in action!! Got to take home a small box filled with candy. CSB is a must try they only make limited amounts per night! #getonthis"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon R&D on our first blazing hot night in Toronto. We were seeking shelter from the hot August sun.    Hope is an awesome bartender. She was a real sweetheart. We really enjoyed the drinks that she made us. They were unique and tasty.   Random - two gentlemen next to us ordered beer and it was served in a tea kettle with tiny little cups. Super odd and dainty. I asked them and they weren't a fan either."}
{"text":"Underwhelming.  That's not entirely true since to be underwhelmed implies I had high expectations going in that were let down.  No, this place lived down to my expectations.  After reading other reviews and looking at the menu for myself we ventured to chinatown and found R&D empty on a tuesday evening at appx 630pm (this just after we departed wvrst at 615pm where it was packed w/ a great vibe...this was obvious sign number one).  We had a large party of 10 people w/ reservations in place from about two weeks prior.  We did everything family style which made for a wonderful opportunity to try the whole menu except the peking duck (although give me a break, go to any other chinatown spot or north york joint and the duck will be less than half the price and taste just as good if not better and also served two or three ways..$65+?!, crazy).  We  had all the expected dishes you can imagine from the CSB to the curry, lobster chow mein, chicken/waffles, ribs, ceviche, etc.  One recurring theme was the tremendous amount of deep frying and sugar on everything.  Even the ribs were fried and had a strange non-asian glaze on them.  One of the beauties of asian cuise is its simplicity in ingredients and focus on quality.  not here.  ribs were like eating honey coated jerky, not appetizing.  the chicken and waffles....chicken did have a nice batter that was crispy yet fluffy however no flavor stood out.  waffles might have been the best thing because at least there you expect a fair amount of sweetness in the dish.  small portion size.  extremely overpriced for what you get in terms of not just portions but moreover quality.  quite poor.  i might reconsider this as a bar/small bites place only but never again for a sit down meal.  far superior asian fare is right outside the corner, every other corner.  avoid."}
{"text":"Oh no! I had a stupidly great time at R and D. The drink I had was fantastic (the horror of lower spadina or something). Servers were delightful. The decor is cool as fuck. I like this place. A lot. The Chinese hash was the perfect brunch piece. Delicious. Hearty. Comforting. Not too heavy. Really dug the flavors and textures in that bowl. Very impressed."}
{"text":"Similar to others, I was super excited to come after season 1 and it was also super tough to get reservations. We had a group 6 people for dinner on a Sat. I was excited to see Eric working in the kitchen!  Decor: - Very nice interior with a sorta industrial look/feel to it - comfy seat with a view of the kitchen  Food: - We decided to order several dishes and share among the table - Apps: we got grandpa's fun guo, spring rolls (recently changed). These were a bit so-so as the fun guo was not that special as could get similar ones at dim sum. The spring rolls (no longer there) was actually not bad as they were more like shrimp rolls. - Mains: Duck Duck bao, General Sanders Chicken, Chili Crab BiBimnap, Brussel Sprouts. The duck was good but it didn't seem to live up to the expectation. Presentation was great and steamed baos were good but the flavour was missing something. We also noticed that it was kind of cold when it was served. The general sanders chicken and brussel sprouts were a hit. Bibimbap was also good but didn't surprise us.  Generally, it was hit and miss for the mains but as a group we found the portions to be quite small (we had to stop for more food afterwards). Perhaps if we had ordered more but it seemed like alot of food already. I will try it again to see if things change."}
{"text":"The food is deeeeeeliccciooousss. The drinks are unique and amazing, the only place I go to for Chinese food because as someone who grew up on Chinese Jamaican cuisine this is as good as it gets here in Canada. The prices are really great too, the décor, the ambiance the vibe is on point. The only thing I hate is how early they close, ;) but more people should give them a try, their fried rice is the best in the city. Their salmon is portioned on the smaller side but that's to be expected and my friends LOVE their beef ribs. talk about mouth watering."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of Masterchef Canada and to see Eric win and follow a career that he was passionate about.  I can see him loving every minute of it too behind the restaurant's open concept kitchen.  The atmosphere and decor of this restaurant was very dim and relaxing (it was funny to see an older woman read the menu with her phone flash on though!).  The barreling lights and mosaic walls made the place very upbeat and contemporary.  Good vibes overall.  I came with 2 friends and we each got a few dishes to share.  We started with the bbq pork buns that was fresh baked on the hour every hour.  No regrets it was delicious and totally would have wanted more but there was more on the menu that we wanted to taste.  We ordered a side of black bean brussel sprouts too and that was great!  The sauce wasn't overwhelming and you can still taste the brussel sprouts.  I ordered the lobster chow mein, it was the dish i got super jelly over when the judges got to try it during a pressure test.  Hands down would have it again it was flavourful and the lobster was done just right.  Other dishes had were crab bimbimbap and General Sanders Chicken.  Note: General Sanders Chicken is to share, way too big for one to eat.  It wasn't a tough lesson to learn as it was very tasty too.  We had smoked milk with malted milk ice cream.  It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet which is why i liked it so much.  I would come back at another special occasion because the price point is quite high."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: At $90 per head, I could Uber Black Car it to Markham instead.  Another week and another Chinese hipster resto opening up Downtown. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for it, and it's about GD  time Chinese cuisine got more of the limelight, but there's a reason peeps still flock to the usual China Town hangouts or venture up to Markham for the best: better quality and value.  Let's get this out of the way: I really liked the space. They managed to make a cavernous space into a fairly quiet and intimate setting with their sea of hanging lights and moderate volume of music. Our server was great and attentive, and really took the time to find out the answers to our numerous (annoying) questions such as \"what temperature was the octopus sous vided at?\"! (I suppose that was inevitable coming from a group of sous vide water immersion owners ;P)  Now, let's talk about them dishes:  CSB - Not gonna rehash this since everyone else has mentioned it, but $8 for 2 is steep, yo. Crafted in a similar fashion as Tim Ho Wan in Hong Kong (cheapest Michelin 1-star resto in the world, which happens to be located in the most expensive real estate market in the world), except THW charges about $2 for the same thing. :/  SHRIMP TOAST: Very fresh shrimp, with the duck yolk tasting not unlike the yolk from moon cakes. Again $13 for 3 is STEEP!  SHIITAKE POLENTA FRIES: Definitely a must order. This was universally enjoyed by my DC's.  BEEF TONGUE: Forgettable.   OCTOPUS: Sous vided at 60 C, this was tasty, but be warned, you don't get much for $16.  LOBSTER CHOW MEIN: I never watched Master Chef so I just don't have the emotional connection to this dish as others. The 4 pieces of lobster were decent, though I would've rather just ordered a whole lobster for the same price next door.   CRAB BIBIMBAP: The issue here is that the inherently strong bibimbap sauce basically nukes the delicate flavours of crab meat. You could've added imitation crab meat and I wouldn't have known the difference. For $18, I'd rather go to Seor Ak San for their bibimbap, free appies and a couple of beers.   SWEETBREADS: Though I'm not generally a sweetbreads kinda guy, I quite liked these!  SWEET & SOUR PORK RIBS: Definitely worth getting a full rack to share amongst friends. The glaze was flavourful and the ribs were tender.  STEAK BEARNAISE: Probably one of the highlights of the night. This was very, very good and worth the splurge.  76HR PEKING DUCK: Didn't order this - it seems to have been universally panned as the dish to avoid. My DCs and I figured if we were still hungry, we'd just head somewhere down the street for it instead.  BANANA SPLIT: It is what is it is. Definitely way too much for one person, so it's best shared - in fact 6 of us shared this!  So there you have it. We also ordered some cocktails - they were okay. Overall everything tasted aite but it's hard to really get too excited about it."}
{"text":"The hostess was working double duty as wait staff as we waited at the door for a few minutes. We didn't have any reservations so luckily they had room for 2 on a late Monday night. We ordered 4 dishes: 2 smalls, 1 large and a dessert. But they recommended 2 small and 2 large plates for 2 people to share. The curry Bao was my least favourite. The texture of the filling was so mushy and difficult to chew. The scallop ceviche was really unique and an explosion of flavour in my mouth; crispy, zesty and refreshing. The large plate was the Hainese risotto. It was delicious! The risotto was so creamy with some squash in it, perfect for winter. The chicken was really tender and pretty filling for 2. Highly recommended! I had the Kaya toast for dessert and it was so so good. I wish there was more! Brown butter gelato with cornbread waffle, people!  Good ambiance (4/5), service was alright (3/5), took some time to get people's attention to pay and it didn't feel like we had 1 specific person serving us. It was pretty pricy (value 3/5) for not feeling stuffed, but most of the dishes was worth the money (food 4/5). The Masterchefs lived up to their reputation."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner, and food was mediocre. Majority of the dishes we ordered (grandpa's fun guo, tom yum salmon and their recommended fried rice) were okay, nothing special. However, staff was beyond friendly and made dinner that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"OK this became a story of how hard it is to do everything right, when you set bar really high. Bit how worth it that is.  So, being a noob visitor to this town, I set the bar pretty high based on the website: a rebel & demon from Master Chef Canada? And they're in the middle of freaking Chinatown.  Cheap eats everywhere. What makes this worthwhile? Bar high.  (Oh and having a very fine gin & tonic which is lubricating this review)  I am having a couple of apps: First to arrive are the venison spring rolls: a great concept but not executed well.   The server warns me that they might be hot the first couple of bites; in fact they are pretty lukewarm and even cool on the inside. The filling is tasty and I can imagine if they are actually piping hot they would be delicious. For better or worse, the expectation was set, and then very under delivered.   And then the Char Siu Bao come out and OMFG they are so f$&&ing amazing. Like someone took corn muffins tops and invented Char Siu Bao with it. Amazing!! And piping hot too. Every bite was so delicious and unique! Even those extra \"crispy edges\" that come when you overfill a muffin pan. I can see why these would be a signature dish. Like no CSB I have ever tasted, well worth the visit.  So I have to be an a$$ and ask if I can get a spring roll piping hot, I want to see what these could be like if they're executed right....  And Chef delivers. 2 piping hot spring rolls, as the first set should have been. The venison filling is a unique taste, and with the proper temp, so flavorful! In a delicious way, almost like a venison chili, hmmm.  Delicious!  And like the CSB, something I've never tasted before, worth a visit!  So in the end, when the execution delivers, these earn their place above the high bar! Just maybe need to hold them to be consistent to their bar...."}
{"text":"Just came here for dinner last night for the first time. To be quite honest, I didn't watch the first season of Masterchef, but I've heard enough about Eric Chong and quite frankly I just love to eat, so I've had this restaurant on my \"to try\" list for a while.  We made a reservation for 5:30 and when we arrived closer to 6 the place was pretty empty (only like 2 other groups) but filled up completely by the time we left around 8. The main dining area is dimly lit, but open concept with high ceilings and trendy, modern, political (I'm looking at you, Mao Zhedong) decor and artwork. It was a nice environment to dine in, very casual but not overly loud.  The best way to tackle this menu is probably to just order a bunch of things to share, kind of like dim sum/tapas style. As a group of 3, we ordered:  CSB BBQ Pork Buns ($8 for 2): This was my favourite dish of the night. Rather than the soft, fluffy white BBQ pork buns that you normally get in dim sum, the bun here was harder and crunchier in texture, almost like a pineapple bun. We found out later from talking to Eric that apparently it is actually based on a Mexican sweet bun (I think called a concha?) Anyway, I really enjoyed the bun/pastry, which was sweeter than a normal BBQ pork bun but mixed well with the sour sauce on the BBQ pork. I would order this again.  Grandpa's Fun Guo ($8 for 3): These are like dumplings filled with chicken and black truffle. I enjoyed the filling, which was very flavourful and delicious. I wasn't as crazy about the dumpling skin however, because I thought it was too thick and sticky. Worth trying.  Shrimp Toast ($12): We got this because it sounded interesting. It's not like a whole piece of bread, instead it's like 6 cubes of bread topped with black truffle, cauliflower, and preserved duck egg. It was a good mesh of pretty distinctive flavours and the presentation was lovely. I enjoyed this and was glad I tried it, but I personally don't think this is something I would order more than once.  Eric's Lobster & Seafood Chow Mein ($25): Ok, this dish kind of confused me for a number of reasons. Firstly, the noodles weren't like the Cantonese chow mein noodles that I expected - instead they were quite a bit thicker, more like egg noodles. Secondly, the dish was quite a lot smaller than I expected. Then the flavour... it wasn't bad, but it was definitely quite light, one could even say bland. My friend who normally likes heavier flavours didn't like it, but my other friend who prefers lighter flavours enjoyed it, so I suppose it is really a matter of personal preference. There was a slight bitter aftertaste which I think might have been due to the lime that was used (I think we saw some chunks of lime?), and I thought I tasted a bit of lime-iness, so it was interesting, but I can see how it might not be for anyone.  At this point we were all still kind of hungry, so added a few more things to our order:  Shiitake Polenta Fries ($8): Not much to say about them, they were pretty good and I liked the mushroomy flavour, which was just right in terms of heaviness (not too overpowering, but definitely noticeable.)  Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs ($25): After seeing the lobster & seafood chow mein we were expecting this to be of a similar size, but it was actually surprisingly big, enough for 2 ribs per person (6 in total.) They're different from like American smoked ribs or whatever, in that the meat is tougher and doesn't really fall off the bone, but is not dry at all. This was definitely more sour than sweet, and assaulted all our noses with a strong vinegar-y smell. It was pretty decent though, and definitely very very filling.  Our bill after tax came to $97, and we were all totally stuffed, which was actually disappointing because we had originally wanted to try the dessert platter. I think we were all pretty satisfied with what we ate, although things were a bit hit or miss. Overall I would rate the food a 3.5, and take a 1/2 star off for the service... I don't know, I thought all the wait staff were nice, but for some reason I found them all awkward to talk to. They would all talk kind of fast and in this way that came off as flippant. It was nice though of our waitress to ask Eric to stop by our table because my friend was fangirling so hard, although he must have been busy because we sat around waiting for him for a good while after our meal was done. He seemed super nice, but unfortunately we didn't get to really talk to him much because we were all too starstruck and tongue tied."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place has a fair amount of hype, Master Chef egos and all. Which means it is ripe for scrutiny. First off, the physical space is expansive, with high ceilings exposed beams and a very cool bar at the front. Long and narrow, it doesn't feel too cramped, although seating at the front is low and lounge-like.  The service staff are very friendly and accommodating. Dishes are brought out with a flurry of explanation (\"this is a blah blah with this reduction and that sauce and etc. etc.); slightly tedious after the first tapas comes out. But very nicely presented, all the same.  The food: some great flavors and interesting takes on classics Asian dishes. Egg rolls are delicious, with a pesto sauce inside. Very original. Shrimp toast has a nice wasabi bite.  Roasted beets in a peanut sauce was a tastey mix, but roast beets are so overdone. The octopus was tender and tastey, but give us more than two tentacles, please. Sanders chicken was yum deep fried goodness with ok dipping sauces. The curried beef was in a rich sauce, but the beef was too mealy.  Cocktails were hit and miss. Hit: Big Trouble in Little Spadina. From the name on down this drink was awesome. Star Punch is aromatic and sweet/sour. Miss: Maple Old Fashioned tasted like prune juice and chicken stock. Don't order (unless you like prune juice and stock).  Verdict? A nice night. Good food. Great service. But for the hype and price, they've gotta step it up. You hear that Eric and Alvin? Step it the fuck up!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic servers.  Great food.  Good beer.  Stupidly good bao and amazing chow mein.  Shockingly affordable. A+"}
{"text":"The first thing we did upon sitting down was order some CSB which they said takes 20 minutes to bake. After that we ordered the rest of our food (plus the peking duck we reserved a day earlier).  CSB: 4/5 - Good dish if a bit too flavourful for me. A unique take on char siu bao which does make it a bit tastier.  Macau Cauliflower Curry: 4/5 - Pretty good. Decent size and a pretty unique concept with the cheungfun  Scallop Ceviche: 3/5 - Decent. I wouldn't order it again though. The flavour didn't really do it for me.  Kalbi: 5/5 - Definitely the best dish of the night. Tender meat and great flavour. We cleaned up the rice cake underneath as well.  Bibimbap: 4/5 - Good, but I prefer some meat in my bibimbap. The waitress asked us if we wanted her to mix in the hot sauce. Good thing we chose to do it ourself because it's inherently spicy.  Peking Duck: 3/5 - The duck meat itself is fantastic and the way they cook it is very unique. However, I actually prefer the traditional Chinese pancakes (thinner and stretchy) to the thick hard ones they use because you can't really taste the hoisin and duck flavours as well with all that breading. It feels like they used the pancake just to make it different rather than better. Because of that, I honestly prefer peking ducks from more traditional Chinese restaurants for like half the price. They should give you the choice of what style of pancakes you want. Also, it's kind of ridiculous they only give you 8 pancakes and charge extra for more considering it's +$70 for the duck in the first place.  Overall, this place is currently pretty underrated on Yelp. Sure, the food isn't the best Asian  fusion food I've had, but it IS good. Maybe we skipped the \"miss\" dishes I guess. The atmosphere is pretty unique for Chinatown as well and the service was good."}
{"text":"Great service and food here. We came as a small group and had a great time. The portions are hard to figure out so we ended up ordering quite a bit. Our favourite across the board was the chicken platter. Delicious. My only complaint is the price."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed the dishes I had here last night.  Started with the fun guo dumpling. Great flavour but wasn't sold on the texture of filling. I think I'm just used to a softer centre. Next was the Jerk chicken steamed bun, pretty good.  Similar to other reviews, the CSB was phenomenal!! I could eat this anytime anywhere. The chow mein had winning flavours but the noodle texture was a tad dry in my opinion. Fried chicken was also phenomenal! Overall an excellent meal and AMAZING VALUE."}
{"text":"A big fan of the show \"master chef\". Eric, (winner of master chef Canada season 1) is the owner of this fine establishment. I've been here numerous times, mainly for their extraordinary Peking duck, but I've also tried a lot of the other items as well. They specialize in dishes that are meant to be shared, so if y'all were to order a \"large dish\", that is most likely better shared amongst the table. Their appetizers aren't bad... but they don't really stand out either. The Baos are probably the tastiest and most distinct item that they have. They have a 7$ daily cocktail special that is served before 7pm.. I missed it by mere minutes so I cannot give opinion upon such matter. Overall, I came here for their Peking duck which is self-proclaimed to be the best in town - it is!.  The duck was PHENOMENAL. It carries the entire restaurant. Overall, the service was great, food could've been better but well worth the experience. Ps: Eric is sometimes in the kitchen and will take pictures upon request! Really nice fella."}
{"text":"Mid-priced Asian fusion restaurant means well but fails to impress.  Usually with restaurants of this genre, dishes involve taking a traditional Asian dish, mixing it with a slight western twist and adding a few luxury ingredients in efforts to mark-up the price point - as is the case with Polenta fries and Shiitake, Chow Mein with Lobster and Seafood, and Bibimbap with Soft-Shell Chili crab. In R&D's case, not only do these luxury additions fail to add value, it distracts the dish from its' traditional source and ends up in what is mostly over-seasoned, dull dishes slapped with a heavy price tag.   The Shiitake Polenta fries by had a lingering aroma of the shiitake, but had little flavor besides the intense heaviness from the \"shiitake\" infused oil used to deep fry them. The mushroom ketchup had no taste of any mushroom, and the sourness over-compensated in the flavor department, causing a major imbalance. Highly forgettable (other than the intense sour aftertaste).  The Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs felt extremely heavy, like the fries. The sauce was way too sour and I couldn't even taste the meat, which had a nice overall texture - but for $25 I definitely expected more. The chili-spiked pineapple was gimmicky but nothing noteworthy. Pineapple itself is a fruit with such a strong flavor that is difficult to have other flavours infused in it - as expected R&D failed to demonstrate any noteworthiness in what they attempted to do. The kohlrabi slaw was interesting.   The Eric's Lobster & Seafood Chow Mein was a major, major disappointment - the noodles were drenched in a watery sauce, bland, salty. For double of what it would cost in a regular Chinatown eatery, it tasted much less interesting. Again, with the \"Asian-fusion formula\", attempts of incorporating scallops and lobster added little value to what is otherwise a cheap quick-fix Chinese dish intended to remedy hangovers and meal-time indecisiveness.   To end the review on a (somewhat) good note, the Soft-Shell Crab Bibimbap was pretty good, the equal portions of bean sprout, mushroom, fungus mixture created an even texture that was accentuated by the freshly deep-fried soft shell crab. The waitress mixed the rice for me but less sauce would have been better, as the crab was a little lost by the saltiness post-mix. The crab and the bibimbap separately would have been great, but clearly the formula failed as the combined dish was definitely a lesser as a sum than its parts.    R&D really needs to go over its seasoning and flavor profile of its dishes; everything was way too salty, I became bored as the meal went on as the dishes became extremely predictable, but worse. Before coming in, I was really looking forward to trying their fun guo and pork buns - unfortunately they were both unavailable along with a few other items the day I visited. The waitress jokingly suggested that I'll have to come back again to try it, which will probably never happen but surely nothing I'll miss out on given the outcome of this visit."}
{"text":"there is a hipster vibe to this place.     The menu has evolved since it opened.  I ordered the chicken and waffles.    only two words for that dish.  - Too Sweet  My table pretty much tried every main dish on the menu including the famous char siu bao's.  I have had the original popular Tim Ho Wan ones in HK (michelin star dim sum).. and was expecting something similar.  But it is actually VERY different.. completely different.   there is essentially no bread to the dough.  I found the outside of the bao very buttery and greasy... its crispy and greasy.. not knocking the taste.. It tasted good.. just seemed very overly greasy and fragile.    i imagine a lot of dishes would seem more interesting if you did not grow up around this sort of cuisine."}
{"text":"There wasn't anything outstanding about the menu. I expected a place called \"R&D\" to have really creative, innovative recipes. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case - there was nothing to get excited about.  I would consider this place expensive for the quality of food...if this is the market it wants to target, I would suggest revamping the menu. I would come here once but not again.   The food was lackluster, but I have to give credit to the bar. The drinks were the best part of the meal. My favourite was the Shanghai Sour. The Big Trouble in Lower Spadina was pretty good too.  My expectations weren't met by R&D. Hopefully, they can find new items to keep foodies coming back. It just doesn't cut it now."}
{"text":"Does anyone know how I can give an establishment ZERO stars?? I need to figure this out so I can give R&D zero stars. Well, maybe I should give credit where it's due and give them one star for the interior design. I really like the murals on the walls and the big thick beams and the high ceilings.  The food though, is another story. It was the worst meal I've had in a long time.   Since there were four of us, we were able to order a large number of dishes to share. And that's one of the great things about going to a Chinese restaurant is that I can have more of a dish I like and less of a dish that I don't. But at R&D, I kept waiting... and waiting... for a dish to come that I could have more of.  Granted, I ate the two appetizer items simply because I was hungry. The CSB wasn't that good but I was hungry. And neither was the fun guo but again I ate it because I was hungry.  But then the Peking Duck came. At $69 a duck, it better be the best in town. Not even close. (If you're in the mood to pay a premium price for Peking Duck, go to Lai Wah Heen and you'll get the best in the city. Or go to the Asian Legend in North York. Their duck is good but not as good as Lai Wah Heen but then again it's only 40 bucks or so.) I took a couple bites of the duck wrapped in the little flour pancake and just left the rest on the plate.  Then the fried rice came. Filled up my bowl. Took a couple bites. Left the rest in my bowl. Then the seafood chow mein came. Scooped a bunch onto my plate. Took a couple bites. Left the rest on the plate. Then the short ribs came. By now I had learnt my lesson so only cut myself a bite-sized portion. Didn't reach out for more.  The Good - the interior design of the space  The Bad - the CSB - the fun guo - the Peking Duck - the fried rice - the seafood chow mien - the short ribs  So I patiently waited... and no dish arrived at our table that I liked. So that notion of going to a Chinese restaurant and being able to have more of what I like and less of what I don't? Well, that didn't quite play out in my favour tonight :-( so I left hungry. Heated up some PC brand frozen lasagna when I got home.  So this place is owned by a couple celebrity chefs?? I guess that's possible, but they sure weren't there cooking our meal.  And my friend that suggested we all go to R&D? Well, she's not allowed to pick restaurants anymore."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place! After walking past its doors at least a hundred times, I've always envisioned this place to be like the Hogwarts 9 3/4 platform where inside was a magical place with really really super tasty food.  #Gryffindor4Life  H*ll to the no! While nothing really technically \"bad\", nothing is really \"good\" either. Full disclosure, they were trying out their new menu, so maybe it was an off night? I apologize if i can't remember all the fancy pants names of the items.   Food:   Tuna Tartare & Cerviche: Best dishes of the night. Great start! Tuna almost reminds you like a poke. Keep on ordering these!   Pork & Bao: This is where things started to go south. Bao was good, but the pork was a tad dry, leaving you with a stringy feel to it.   Chow Mein with Shrimp?: tasty, but nothing next level. Great flavour development and there were bites of something sour that woke up the entire dish. The only grippe I would have is that there is no \"wok hay\" (essence of wok?) that usually comes with great chow mein. Shrimp was cooked perfectly. I kinda felt like asking them if they had XO sauce?  Octopus with asian Chimichurri, miso paste on eggplant: Let's start with the octopus, apparently it was first steamed and then seared for some Malliard browning goodness. That's cool, except it really over done and lost one of the key elements of amazing asian fare-\"freshness\" and it just turns out to be rubbery mess. The other components however were OK?   Fried chicken and waffles: Chicken thats been brined and has heavy traces of five spice and apparently waffles with condensed milk? Pros: Chicken is crunchy and crisp. Cons: the five spice is really overpowering. Once you put the 2 parts together, you realize there's nothing bridging the two distinct elements together and you really just have a piece of fried chicken and a waffle.   Service: It was orite. I just don't think they cared. After the \"chow mein\" came the Fried Chicken and Waffles. Yay! Except that the chow mein had so much excess sauce that we had to pour it out into an empty bowl before we tried the waffles.   Overall: great place to lounge out and impress, but if you're like me, where the stars need to be greater or equal to the dollar sign on the review, I would stay away."}
{"text":"Love the hip atmosphere inside and their appetizers seem like their strong suit as they are very unique & intriguing!   //THE FOOD//  I came here for Winterlicious 2018 ($33 3-course meal) and also to try their CSB (char Siu bao = Chinese BBQ buns) upon strong recommendations.  CSB (5/5)- seeing that it was $8 for 2 buns I was skeptical of it being worth it. But the reviews were so right!! The buns were delicious. The crispy and sweet bun dough is a nice twist on the typical traditional buns. The filling was generous and tasted like the Chinese BBQ pork I'm familiar with but with a saucier and sweeter taste.   Cereal Prawl Tart (4/5)- tons of textures happening, from the crunchy shrimp flavoured topping, crumbly tart crust, and fish mousse. There's a slight spiciness too that compliments the seafood flavours.  Sweet&Sour Tonkatsu (2.5/5)- good portion size but it was underwhelming. The dish was barely warm and the only hot thing about this dish was the siracha-tasting sauce that was drizzled over the black rice. I felt like there wasn't too much thought that went into this dish. The pork loin was good but the breading on the exterior wasn't crispy as it might've been sitting in the sauce for too long.   Milo Panna Cotta (3/5)- basically chocolate pudding with some Oreo crumbles and mini marshmallow. Nothing that outstanding, however, I did try my friend's winterlicious dessert of Yuzu Meringue Tart and liked that MUCH better.  //ATMOSPHERE// Very cool ceiling light fixtures and open kitchen so you get to see the food being made ! Looks like there's a lot of space since there are bar and table seatings. Eric Chong (the owner of the restaurant & master chef Canada winner) was cooking the night that I went, he's super nice and even let me take a selfie with him haha!  //OVERALL THOUGHTS// I'm glad I finally got to try R&D! Their winterlicious menu is a miss for me, their dishes came out barely warm (a common complaint of all the other customers sitting around me) and wasn't anything too special. I would be interested in coming back, but only to try more of regular menu appetizers!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there.  We had the poutine and the bibimbab.  Everything was delicious and the service was terrific.   Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon. Tried their famous CSB bun, grandpas fun guo (good but not memorable), Kalbi Pork Short Ribs (AMAZING), and beef tataki (too salty). The ribs were amazing and super supple. There was a nice gnocchi surprise under the stack of ribs as well!"}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience at R&D!!! Before I went I read SEVERAL reviews on here ,  I was disappointed to see so many negative reviews. SO HAPPY I went anyway and absolutely will go back. I was with an out of town guest, who travels to world class cities, dines in some of the best restaurants  . He was also happy and was planning his next visit to Toronto what he was going to order on his next visit to R&D. I walked him through chinatown to get to our destination he was concerned and skeptical about where I was taking him . I was praying these poor reviews would be wrong according to my experience and perception.     I will tell you first about what we had for dinner   WEIWEI's Watermelon Revolution Cocktail ... Light , refreshing, great choice for the drinker that likes their alcohol hidden  behind other flavors. NOT too sweet , just right.  Grandpa's Fun Guo 3  perfect pieces of DIm Sum filled with chicken and truffle LOVE THEM !!! They are a MUST !!! Little Dragon Bun  Spicy Sichuan Lamb  Again 3  delicate Lamb filled full of  flavor pieces of DIm Sum , They pack a Huge amount of flavor  for such a small package .  Eric's Curry , It is true it is NOT to be missed, beautiful braised beef , our server who was clearly very knowledgeable about every aspect of the menu explained Eric's Curry is slow cooked 12 hour process.  I will add her our server did not miss a single beat but I will speak of service in more detain in  a moment . The beef was so tender the way you want it to be and YES there is a little fat that is to be expected with braised beef , the curry is beautiful and packs a little hit of spice but just enough and not to much , it has a generous amount of mustard green and the coconut rice was fresh and perfect .  Octopus and Eggplant, This dish I loved my dinner companion did not . For Me to was exactly how I want Octopus to be. It was generous peaces that were very very tender . I do NOT KNOW this as I did not ask but it seems they may have done it Sous Vide  then cooked to order. It was soo Tender , the eggplant was perfected cooked , and the chimichurri on the plate was the perfect addition to this dish .  FInish was the Banana  Split , that dessert is the first one on the list for a reason . Of course it was the only dessert I had. I really enjoyed it . It had to many layers and things going on in just the right way . 3 types of ice cream , Peanut butter, Sour Cherry , and unfortunately I can not recall the other one, there is a caramel sauce on the bottom of the dish , then I believe the hidden crunchy pieces had something to do with Ginger, CRISPY BANANA's ( in my opinion that is a meant to be crispy banana's )  the whip cream was coconut whip cream . I never eat whip cream I am just not a fan ( I know weird) I am a FAN of R&D's coconut whip cream . I loved it because it had so many components flavors and textures all in one dish. I recommend sharing this .  We wanted to try so many other items, we were just to full . The food is clearly created and prepared with a a great deal of thought, care, passion, and love.   The Food is created for sharing.   The room , the seats, the atmosphere is extremely comfortable and warm in every way . Take a look around and ask about the walls, why there is one solo plate hung on the wall , what the numbers mean , who are those people on the wall? I did and I learned a LOT . R&D in every way has been thought out with purpose, has an identity which is so important to a restaurant.      I realize a lot of people find it frustrating when sharing  dim sum comes with 3 an order. Before you get upset about this stop and think about where you are for a minute . Do you truly think that Eric and Alvin do not know what they are doing? NO it is not so you order more. Trust me professionals like these men ( whom I have never met ) want you to have a wonderful experience on every level .  I did want to know why and before I asked it I did learn from my server that Dim Sum ( just like it is served EVERYWHERE ) comes in 3's because it is a chinese lucky number. Enjoy the culture . It is NOT the same Dim Sum from down the street yes the price point is higher as the ingredients and labor to make it cost more, this is not frozen food.     Service fantastic on every single level , I was impressed with the level of knowledge , the visible teamwork , the manager worked with his team and interacted with us and every table in the room  . They are a definitely  team . It is an open kitchen so I have my next visit planned as I saw most of the dish's. Our server was one of the better servers that I have had in a very long time. She was so lovely, a nice personable energy, we joked with her and she played along, I asked for suggestions and she gave it with great descriptions, she was attentive.Her name  was Sarah and I would definitely request her on my next visit, she is a true professional."}
{"text":"Came for Summerlicious and mainly because the main had the Hainan chicken as an option and dessert was mango panna cotta with tapioca. And also curious to check out modern/fusion Asian cuisine with bonus of master chef Cooking. At first it was almost unbelievable that this super cool looking and hip place was in china town! Inside decor is very nice and service was good and it was kind of empty on weekday dinner time. The main disappointment was that the food was all so-so: I had pulled pork dumplings and hainan chicken and friend had some kind of curry and soup. It's not bad really it's just very so-so perhaps due to my high expectations with the master chef stamp. The BEST thing though was the panna cotta mentioned above super yummy. I think this is a good place to go to in China town for a fun hang out with friends for drinks and if you are not a hardcore foodie but like pretty good but standard food and are not too anal about excellent \"Chinese\" food."}
{"text":"R&D is located on Spadina close to Dundas St W. in between the hustle and bustle of Chinatown. Opened by Masterchef Canada winner, Eric Chong, and Michelin star chef Alvin Leung, you would think that this would be a recipe for success. However, after my experience there for Summerlicious this year, I left disappointed and underwhelmed by the food and experience. This will probably be my first and last time eating at R&D.  The decor of the restaurant is definitely nice, especially the bar. My brother and I got seated on the circular round tables left of the bar. One complaint is the height of the tables and chairs. It was uncomfortable as the table felt too low (especially for a person who may be taller) and too close together. I almost felt like I could have accidentally hit or punch the customer seated beside me.   Ordering off the Summerlicious menu, we tried a variety of items, which hopefully, gave us a glimpse of what R&D would be about. For appetizers, we both ordered the kalbi tostada which was delicious; only complaint is that when you name a dish \"kalbi\" on the menu, one would expect the meat to comprise of beef. However, in this dish, they used pork tenderloin which should not be considered \"kalbi\". Nonetheless, the appetizer was great.   For mains I ordered the braised beef lo mein and my brother ordered the mac and cheese. The braised beef lo mein was too salty for my tastes, especially when it is cooked in black bean sauce. The saltiness was too much and I had to keep drinking water as a result. The mac and cheese had a unique take on it with the satay sauce but the macaroni pasta itself was overcooked. Unfortunately, both dishes sounded great on the menu and had problems with execution.   Lastly, for desserts I ordered the matcha cake while my brother ordered the korean pancake. The desserts were disappointing, to say the least. My matcha cake was over baked, hard to cut through, and generally very dry. I could have made a better cake myself at home. The Korean pancake was tough to eat with a spoon and wasn't better than the matcha cake.   Overall, the food and experience was underwhelming. It left me with a disappointing experience and I would not return, not even to try the regular menu. The staff were friendly and service would what you would expect (not the best, but not the worst either). The price I paid for what I got was not worthy, in my opinion. Better to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"The first time I came to R&D they had been open for only a few months. The main draw was to go to a restaurant run by the very first winner of Master Chef Canada, Eric Chong. The place was a nice hipster alternative in Chinatown but with such a high price point we definitely wanted to be wowed. Inside the restaurant was a mix match of aesthetics. You enter into a cozy lounge area which precedes the open kitchen, while the back is loud and brash, using street art and leather booths to create a setting that is at once upscale and grungy. Look up and you'll bear witness to an impressive light installation that is reminiscent of a cacophony of steel drums. There's nothing subtle about the design, everything is loud and in your face, very Alvin Leung.   We ordered the Chicken and Waffles, Baos, and the Watermelon Salad plus a teapot of their signature cocktail. Everything felt underwhelming. The chicken was dry, the salad was small (two pieces of watermelon for $8? Really??). At the end of our meal we spoke with Eric but no one had the heart to tell him that the food...just wasn't that good.   Luckily someone did tell him because the second time around and a year later, the menu had been altered slightly and the food was a vast improvement. We ordered the Long Beans, Son In Law Eggs and The Best Duck in the City. The simple dishes were good. The more inventive dishes were great. I loved the inclusion of two beautifully poached eggs over tuna tartare. The flavors were there and the yolk complimented the tuna really well.   The menu is tapas style but has been separated into Sui (small) and Dai (big) plates so you can control the portions you are getting. I would also recommend a third category: Ho Dai since ordering an entire duck was definitely an overwhelming experience for two people! I suggest that for a party of four or five. Or a small village.   Was it the Best Duck In The City? I guess Very Good Above Average Duck doesn't have the same ring. The preparation process is impressive and the duck was delicious with very little fat... but for an Asian hipster joint to declare they have the best Pekin duck when there's so many established restaurants that offer a similar dish for a fraction of the cost...well, you be the judge.   All in all, a really good experience at R&D and happy to know that they've listened to feedback and made changes to the menu. On a side-note, It does boggle my mind that no one has commented on how much Chef Steven Kwon looks like Glenn from Walking Dead. The resemblance is uncanny. And cue that awkward moment when the waiter catches you pulling up a picture on imdb to do a quick side by side. I had a lot of Red Star Punch by this point."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a group of 6 people, and we were lucky to get the best seat in the house. We could see Eric cooking right from our table.   The cocktails we ordered were excellent. I think the show stealer for me were the Dim Sum appetizers; we ordered every single one on the menu and each was better than the last. Everyone loved the Pork Buns, which they prepare every hour during dinner hours. My favourite, definitely, was the Shrimp Toast.   We ordered the Octopus as well, and two of our friends did not want to eat it. But even they loved it after a bite. The Polenta Fries were another classic with a twist and definitely worth ordering.   The platters were the best part of the night, we ordered the General Sanders' Chicken the the Peking Duck. The Chicken had a wonderfully crispy skin and tender and juicy underneath. The Peking Duck was beautifully roasted; the wait staff brought it our table before slicing it up, which was a nice touch.   Try the Smoked Milk desert, which is one the most unique and interesting items on the menu. I was skeptical by the sound of it, but it was delicious.   The dining experience was made a whole lot better by the excellent wait staff, which was on point and made sure we didn't wait too long between items, and that the table was never too crowded.   We spent more than 2 hours in the restaurant catching up and having a great time."}
{"text":"Lychee cactus pear juice  - 5 stars ! I love lychee   Ceviche - 4.5 stars. I wish there were some chips for me to eat with the ceviche  Grandpa fun guo - 4.5 stars. yummy but looks boring....  Ma po toufu poutine - 4 stars. pretty unique, just wish the potatoes were fries ... but not small diced roasted potatoes.  Waffle chicken - 3.8 stars. love the chicken and the egg waffle... The only problem is personally I don't like Sichuan pepper. If you like Sichuan pepper, you will definitely love their dipping sauce.  Crispy smoked milk - 3 stars. The batter of the milk is a bit too thick. Interesting malt ice cream flavour."}
