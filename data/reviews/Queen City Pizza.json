{"text":"I only recently noticed that this place was open in place of Amato (I think that's what the name of the old place was) and after seeing all the positive reviews, decided to try it. I agree with all those positive reviews and really enjoyed my pizza. Tried two types of slices - one with tomato and basil and the other Greek. Both delicious with a nice amount of fresh toppings. The Greek had a nice spicy kick to it, which was a pleasant surprise. The service was very friendly too.  Two thumbs up from me. I will definitely be back and next time will order a whole pizza. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!!! Really nice owner. Pizza was relatively inexpensive but very tasty.  Not as fancy and not great seating options but if you like good pizza try this place"}
{"text":"Really great!  We ordered well done and the pizza was cooked perfectly, not too over done.  Toppings were generous and tomato sauce was tangy and well seasoned.  Love to support a family run business too.  Great new addition to the hood!"}
{"text":"Pizza was tasteless and dry and only around 1 slice of pepperoni per slice. Won't go there again."}
{"text":"Queen City Pizza is exactly what the neighborhood was missing! The quality of the pizza is second to none, it is exactly what you want out of a local pizza joint, reasonably priced and absolutely delicious. I have to make special mention of the service level as well, owner Raj and his family always greet you with a warm hello and friendly conversation. They are a big reason I keep coming back. I hope this place is around for many more years!"}
{"text":"Finally an excellent north american style pizza delivered to our house! We read the reviews and took a chance, like previous posters, we enjoy Italian style flat crust pizza but sometimes we want an excellent old fashioned pizza - and this place was it!! We got the regular thick crust and classic toppings, pepperoni, mushrooms and bacon and double cheese...definitely did not need the double cheese but after years of being scarred by pizza in this city we ordered, next time maybe just extra cheese and extra sauce....and they don't overcook it like so many other places do!! very satisfying."}
{"text":"Great place. Family owned and operated. Had the basil tomato pizza and very tasty. Not for dining in but great for pick up or delivery."}
{"text":"Thank god there's some cheap greasy pizza in the hood. As much as I love the fancy wood ovens offered at Lambretta and Queen Margherita this is so different and so overdue. For the snack after the bar or the quick walk in slice or best of all ordering a personal custom pizza or party size --PERFECT This pizza is not thick like Descendent Detroit style pizza (also on queen) and not at all as thick as DD's (deep dish on gerrard). The crust is thin without even requesting thin crust so you aren't overwhelmed by bread. I just ordered the spicy sausage and pineapple small Great portions of cheese sauce and meat and pineapple of course  Very pleased Can't wait to try the prosciutto or the pesto chicken one. Prices are fairly cheap for a business on queen st"}
{"text":"Family owned and owner operated business! Great people, excellent product, and fair price.   Had excellent reviews on Google but nothing on Yelp, so, I thought it would be prudent for Yelpers to know of it's existence. Nice alternative to the trendy Pizza joints."}
