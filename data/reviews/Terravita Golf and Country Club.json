{"text":"Great Golf & Country Club community!  We were quickly welcomed and integrated into a plethora of activities and groups after we moved in to Terravita.   All the amenities of a resort lifestyle combined with a financially sound community with amazing established (Sonoran Desert) lush landscaping surrounding each home and the community!"}
{"text":"My aunt wanted me to check out this place in case I wanted to work out as I visited from Cali. It's really nice and has a great place to study outside when it's not too hot."}
{"text":"Well worth the visit - people are warm and welcoming - the course is great and scenery is beautiful.  Come and check it out - you will want to find a home and stay!"}
{"text":"Terravita is a welcoming community, with excellent facilities for golf, exercise, tennis and swimming. The community center hosts bridge and mah jongg and other card game groups. The Terravita Art League is very active and has an art lab where artists and aspiring artists can work and take classes. The dining facilities are great. A fantastic gated, guarded community in a beautiful Sonoran Desert setting, very accessible to great shopping and dining nearby. Snowbirds and year-round residents of all ages are lucky to live here."}
{"text":"My wife and I rented a home at Terravita for a month. People are active, warm and friendly. The golf course is great and so are the practice facilities. I'm a 10 handicap and don't think I would get tired of it. Also, they have nearly as many women golfers as they do men so a lot of couples play together. 

We were provided a social membership as a monthly renter so we were able to enjoy all the facilities including the excellent gym, pool, tennis courts and restaurant. There is a lot of wildlife due to all of the undeveloped land - over 1,300 homes but you still feel you're in the countryside. Many of the homes have beautiful views of Black Mountain to the North. We liked it so much and find the membership affordable so are now shopping for either an updated home there or one we can update ourselves as so many are doing."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Glad I'm not a member. I feel bad for my family that has to support this club."}
