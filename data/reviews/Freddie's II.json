{"text":"While the news of my review will not change the existing rating for the better (lord knows it can't get any worse), I think it's important just to reinforce the idea that this is not a good place to go.  I visited this place on a Saturday afternoon -- it was virtually dead.  There are restaurants within 10 minutes of this place that are very busy.  Please, no \"the economy sucks\" excuses for this place!  I had the Penne Florentine with Grilled Chicken.  This is one of the waitresses favorite dishes.  It was about as bad as it could get.  First, there was so much oil that I had to be careful while eating it that I didn't accidentally splash my clothes.  The pasta and chicken were drowning in it.  Second, the chicken was frozen and tasted freezer burned.  It had fake grille marks on it, and was clearly microwaved.  Nothing about the dish said fresh or clean, or otherwise attractive in any way.  When the waitress asked about how I liked it, I told her the main problems.  She returned from the kitchen with three answers:  1. It's my favorite. 2. The kitchen says that it's supposed to be swimming in oil. 3. The chicken was fresh.  So, once again, for proving that Denial is not just a river in Africa, Freddie's II deserves the 1-star rating it gets!  Yuck!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped there for dinner.  We ordered from the early bird menu since the regular menu's prices were out of sight.  I ordered the fried shrimp & fries.  They only gave me three butterfly shrimp and a handful of fries.  My husband ordered the chicken parm, which included one medium size piece of chicken, and what amounted to a side order of pasta.  Salads weren't included, so we had to pay extra, and I was charged $1 extra for a little bit of blue cheese dressing (which I wasn't informed about the extra cost of the dressing.)  Pepsi was over $2 each.  We paid over $32, plus tip, for what amounted to enough food for a snack.  We walked out of there hungry.  Needless to say, we'll never go there again."}
{"text":"Scary dining - not for the feint of heart.  I always try to give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt and a second visit.  In this case, since a group of friends likes to go there for drinks after high school football games, Freddie's II got several shots at impressing me.  I can't think of many positives.  The food is sub-par, overpriced, and served by grumpy people who never seem to get anything right.  If it were my place, I would fire the kitchen and wait staff and start from scratch.  Perhaps Robert Irvine will come in and rescue this place from its owner, who seems like a fixture at the end of the bar, and they should try to do a better job of keeping the scary kitchen guys out of sight.  It looks like the bar and dining room used to have pretty decent atmosphere back in the day, but it's run-down and dated looking now.  I don't even like going there for drinks (overpriced) and even though I might be forced to return with friends, I won't be tricked into ordering anything from the menu next time.  One PLUS is that they often feature some pretty good live entertainment."}
