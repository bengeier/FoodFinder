{"text":"Food was ok.  Tapenaki chef was ok but what is up with the chef and the servers being rude and mocking the customers. I remember this place when I was young when there was humour in the experience but not at the expense of the paying customers. They were making fun of Quebec food like we all eat hot dogs and poutine...the chef made fun of my friend for ordering her meat well done not realizing she is pregnant. The server was so rude I had to tell her to keep her attitude in check if she wanted to live through her shift without a chopstick flying into her eye by accident...wtf! Who is paying here for a meal and an experience...if I wanted to go to just for laughs nasty show I would but this was a birthday dinner...anyways not going back. Not worth the money and clothes smells like food."}
{"text":"Great place.   While shopping with my wife and daughter in Laval we decided to look for a cool place for supper. So we hit Yelp. My wife suggested a Japanese Steak House and to our surprise Toyota was not far away.   I have been to a number of these grills. My wife had been to one in Detroit many years ago. And this was a first time adventure for my daughter.   So to sum it up: Great place!!  The show was not as flashy as some other Japanese Grills. I actually prefer this.   The food was GREAT.   The onion soup is fantastic. Much better than the norm. Yummy!  My daughter had the chicken and stake. My wife had the fillet mignon. I had the fillet mignon and jumbo shrimp. It was all AMAZING.   We tasted each other's food. It was all great.   This is a busy place though so either get there early (like we did) or make a reservation.   So give this place a try. I can't wait to go back. I'll have to include my son on our next visit.   High praises."}
{"text":"It's a nice place. I have to say that the food is very good and the price is reasonable though a bit towards the high end. We had the steak , jumbo shrimps, scallops, and the lobster tails. All were very nice and tasty !!! I don't recommend the lobster tails, they are tasty but not worth the extra 24$ ... go with the steak and shrimps. Highly recommended!!!  It is also a kid friendly place, we went there on Monday afternoon so it wasn't crowded and most tables had families with children.   The actual show / cooking was not \"wow\" ... throw in some oil and fire. I've been to other Japanese grill places and they really give you a show!! You get amazed ! But here I was disappointed with what we saw but our stomachs were not.   I would recommend this place and would go there with the kids again in 4-5 months, maybe even next year.   PS. Change your steamed rice with fried. It's $3 more but better"}
{"text":"This place was amazing the food was great and the chef very entertaining. The wait staff were very polite and extremely efficient. I strongly suggest this place to anyone."}
{"text":"OMG! Am just coming back from this place that still knows how to run the show, 30 years later! I had not been since I was a kid and we had as much fun!  Portions are a little too big to my taste but support the pricing.  Excellent in its simplicity.  Arigato  ???/????  ---  OMG! Je reviens de cet endroit qui, après 30 ans, savent toujours autant nous amuser. Je n'y étai spas retournée depuis jeune fille et ai eu autant de plaisir.  Les portions sont un peu grosses à mon goût mais vont de pair avec le prix.  Excellent dans toute sa simplicité.  Arigato  ???/????"}
{"text":"I had previously visited the Toyo location downtown and had certain expectations before walking in. The male staff members were cheerful and helpful, however the female staff's efforts were lacking. I suppose we require more alcohol then they are used to serving because we had to flag them down on multiple occasions for more drinks / bottles of wine. The menu options were a little limited but the food itself was delicious and served with the talent of putting on a show. Although the food and show were great, the waitresses needed to pay a little more attention to ensuring all guest needs are met. It is still a great night, just could have gone a little smoother."}
{"text":"I've been craving some Japanese cuisine as of late and felt it was due time for me to visit Toyo. I went with their popular combo option that consists of a selection of 6 appetizers then a main dish of my choosing.  The Pros :  - Their onion soup was simply OUT OF THIS WORLD good! It was served in a very esthetically beautiful soup bowl and was quite flavorful. A great start!  - I went with their Sirloin Hibachi Steak. Asked for medium rare, got it medium rare. Compliments to the chef for not mucking this one up. It was very good, seasoned appropriately and served in an entertaining fashion. My palate was quite appreciative. :)  - The dining experience can get pretty interactive and fun! Toyo is specialized in Japanese Tappanyaki cuisine where you get to sit around a huge table that has large iron griddles called teppan. Then you get to watch the chef work his magic right in front of you with humor and flair. Nothing beats seeing the exaggerated expressions/gestures of the chef, his witty jokes and obviously seeing the fire come up occasionally. Cool! As you sit around a communal table of 8, it's can get pretty social. Great for party groups.  - The service was relatively quick and attentive. Enough time to enjoy your evening, come back occasionally to ensure we are happy with our drinks.  - The resto is warmly decorated with rich detail with rich cultural Japanese ambiance. You walk in and you truly feel you're no longer in Laval. Thankfully! It's very clean and proper with attentive staff taking care of their patrons and guiding them to the appropriate teppan tables. It's nice to see so many beautiful teppan table. It is recommended to reserve ahead of time and I could see why, it's pretty busy.  The Neutral :  - I found that the Hibachi Shrimps weren't anything to write home about. I've had some delicious shrimp and even their provided chili sauce (tasted a lot like dijon and mild) and ginger sauce did little to make it taste on par with other things on the menu.  - I was told there would be ice cream or sorbet options. I was given the default sorbet option along with the rest of the table... which is orange sorbet. SHENANIGANS! However, it was delightful though I personally would have preferred to have my own selection. The tea that came with the ice cream hit the spot nicely before going back to the cold wastelands of Laval outside.  - The price tag isn't cheap but it compares well with experiences you can have elsewhere.  Cons :  - The salad. I didn't like the dressing at all. Too much of it and the taste wasn't for me. I noticed many similar patrons on our table not finish this so I'm not the only one who felt this way.  - I was pretty disappointed in the vegetables. I personally don't like zucchinis and my close friend doesn't like mushrooms but it didn't matter for us since every main combo meals comes with the standard selection of vegetables that consist of onions, zucchinis and mushrooms. Boring and unfortunate.  The Ugly :  - The meal options are sadly pretty restrictive. This severely limits your options with the same unwanted veggies, the same mediocre salad, the same shrimp... and so forth. If given the option to choose another type of salad, your selected choice of vegetables or even your select ice cream it would greatly improve the dining experience.   All in all, I'd rate the experience 3.5 stars but since I never round up, you'll see a somewhat harsh 3 star review. Don't get me wrong, it's a place I'd strongly recommend to visit at least once in your lifetime particularly for an event such as a birthday with a group of 8 or less.   However, due to the limitations of the menu as mentioned in the ugly section of my review, this limits my interest of coming back unless I start ordering selectively items off the menu which I feel would probably be a huge inconvenience for the chef. Why come back to eat here when I'll be stuck eating the same appetizers that mostly left to be desired?  I wouldn't necessarily not want to go back but I'm likely not going to propose the idea neither as well."}
