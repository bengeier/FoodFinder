{"text":"I have been getting takeout out dining in to this place for 5 years now, we get takeout once every two weeks. It is above average compared to other similarly priced places in Durham and Toronto. You get very good value here. The takeout is excellent 90% of the time .. however there is the odd order that has raw fish that is noticeably less fresh/less appealing (lost a star). This seems to occur randomly. Staff and service are excellent."}
{"text":"Best sushi place I've been to in Ajax. They have a pretty decent selection and for the price it is worth it when you are craving all you can eat. I have been here a few times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here at 6pm for dinner,service was extremely slow.The sushi was horrible not fresh,found a bug on my plate ! Complained to a waitress she denied what I saw and removed the plate right away! This restaurant is under a different owner,they are all rude and Manager was of no help! I went home threw up various times and had diarrhea went to my doc next day was told I had food poisoning ! Please stay away from this place was a great place until new owner and now very dirty and spoiled fish!"}
{"text":"We have been here for so many times. Their foods are good, service not bad. But this time is very awful because of the owner. We ordered salmon sashimi at the third time, the owner(manager) told us they had not enough salmon to provide. Are you kidding me? AYCE sushi store had not enough to be ordered!!! Another ridiculous thing is the owner said next time if you came to our store for these much order (75 pieces salmon sashimi for 5 people), need to ask first if they could provide before having dinner here. We felt very upset for we couldn't order what we liked to eat, then I paid AYCE. We won't go back."}
{"text":"Really good sashimi and sushi. Always fresh and yummy. Service is fast and friendly. It's our go to local sushi place."}
{"text":"best sushi ever, even better than the ones in toronto like sushi moto or tomo sushi, something along sushi D but with better service and better price . lotsa parking in the plaza, great owner and management , been there about 20 times will go back for sure for more . ask for the shrimp ;) very special."}
{"text":"Took my Brother here for Father's day with his wife and children. The menu is impressive and price is right.  We got something for everyone. Wait staff are attentive and the sushi tasted fresh. Good choice for one, two, small group or large table"}
{"text":"Grat little place, good service and great sushi, make sure you try the ginger ice cream after your meal"}
{"text":"Great all you can eat buffet.  Food tastes great.  Has a pretty decent selection.  Also a great place for take out but its better if you go for the all you can eat buffet."}
{"text":"Very tasty, prices are reasonable. The bento boxes are only $13 and it can almost feed 2 people. Great place for sushi fix."}
{"text":"Went here with my cousins and some family and I must say I was fairly pleased! 

We went on a labour day so it was not as packed, and the selection of food on their menu was great! 

The sushi was great, their sashimi was quite delicious and they had pretty good beef skewers to appetize my meat cravings. Waiters were very polite and helpful. Not sure if I'll come back only because its outside Toronto."}
{"text":"Not bad. Used to go all the time but they aren't very friendly anymore. I was with people who were ordering a lot and eating it all, and they stopped bringing food out at some point. We ordered but it was never brought out. All you can eat? Not really. We do not go there anymore."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Amazing service!  Their crab salad is so light and tasty.  Food is made fast and you never feel rushed to get in, eat and get out.   They have revamped their menu to include a number of items for those not adventurous.  Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Had a very poor lunch experience, sushi had too much rice for the thin piece of fish on top. Cooked food was just OK, some dishes came out hot, other dishes seemed like they has been reheated. Service was also terrible, had to ask multiple times for tea, water, and napkins."}
{"text":"2 and 1/2 star for the food and 1 star for service! I'm from Markham and was in Ajax for the weekend. I was hoping to find a descent sushi AYCE and saw this place had 4 stars. So we decide to give it a try and had high hopes. But to be honest, this place is just ok and the people who are reviewing this may have not had  the chance to try quality AYCE around the gta. 

Food quality and quantity is ok for the lunch price ($16.00). They don't put a good chunk of fish when you order the sushi rolls. But, we enjoyed their udon soup dumpling and bbq eel rice. 
The service is what made our lunch experience terrible. They have no curtosy and service manners. On the very first round of our order, we barely touched our sushi roll (4 pieces) because we didn't like the taste of it, so we left it on the side. The server wearing glasses came straight to us and rudely told us why we didn't eat it, if we didn't finish it she will charge us extra. We kindly explained to her we didn't like it, so she takes my bbq eel rice bowl and said: did you like this rice? I said it was ok, while making me feel very uncomfortable and frustrated. Then, we noticed the table next to us left pieces of sushi and a barely eaten hand roll. Yet, they weren't told rudely that they would be charge for food that was uneaten. 

We were hoping to have a really great experience, but we didn't. Next time I'm in Ajax, I'll try Makimono. I'm not coming back here."}
{"text":"Really good stuff! Just tried their take-out of 3 reg roll for $10. Really good. Also ordered 2 order of salmon sashimi. Very fresh. And their chef actually gave us extra piece of fish for each order. Sweet!  we would go back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with sushi! 
It was my first time going to this sushi place in Ajax and I've heard so much about it since high school (2010) so thought I should finally visit this place. 
Their sushi, rolls and tempura and meat dishes were pretty good... Love salmon anything and everything! There's always room for dessert so ordered the usual green tea and mango ice cream. Also, every person gets seaweed and mango salad... So good! 
The only thing that I didn't like about this place is that it was dead quiet!!! We literally had to request for some music because it was so awkward! 
Other than that the food and service was great."}
{"text":"Not sure what woman it was but I went to pay my bill and she asked if I want the change.
They are not friendly there and you ask my for a tip.
Want a tip? Go get another job you ignorant bitch"}
{"text":"First time at Sushi Mountain. 

Was not bad, but also nothing special. I find that a lot of AYCE sushi places taste more or less the same and this was no exception. Usually the hot dishes are where I find any real variety and these were just ok. 

One standout for myself and the kids was the veggie fried rice. Nice chunks of carrots, celery, onion with a little egg mixed it. They didn't overlook the veggies though so they still had some crunch and flavour. Quite nice."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant with huge flavour. DÃ©cor is simple and sleek, the service is always great. You'll want to go early if you're grabbing lunch; it gets busy fast!

The menu is modest, compared to other sushi places I've been to, but it never disappoints. This AYCE restaurant is very consistent. They don't change their menu often, but when they do, it's always delicious. I find that with a smaller menu, they're really good at what they've got.

The Dynamite Roll and the Gyoza make my day every time. Sometimes the chefs get a little overzealous and stuff the rolls with so much goodness you can barely get it in your mouth. It might be for their own amusement because biting a piece in half is just crazy talk. Besides, you can never have TOO much sushi, right?

I've been coming to this place a lot over the past few years and I never thought it would be difficult to review. This is the restaurant that started my sushi addiction. This is the restaurant I compare all other sushi to. So, if you read my other sushi reviews, good or bad, it was compared to this gem."}
{"text":"This was a great location for a family meal. Lots of parking and the restaurant was very spacious. Families with rambunctious kids could enjoy a meal without disturbing other patrons. The menu has a variety of options but is pretty standard when it comes to AYCE restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.   Sushi and sashimi served at just the right temperature and cut beautifully.  Great selection.  Great flavor.  This is my new favourite place next to T&T in Ajax and I've been to them all in the area."}
{"text":"I think this place is great! The food is very fresh and the quality is better than most AYCE places in Toronto. The sushi is made into good proportions of rice and fish. The only complaint is that the rice does fall apart a bit. The cooked food is excellent. I love the avocado salad. I give this place four stars because you can taste the freshness of the ingredients and it seems pretty clean."}
{"text":"This has been our sushi spot of choice ever since moving to Whitby and we have dined here many, many times. This place has taken a turn for the worst and the quality in their food has taken a noticeable dip. 
The tempura bits in their spicy maki and sushi were soggy and chewy. All of the sushi and maki had a funny taste to it which is why we had to incur the food waste charge. There were no refills to the drinks which comes to be expected here.
There were no objections to the cooked food as the unagi and rice, deep fried wontons and tempura were all up to par. However, about an hour later our stomachs were objecting the entire meal. Not happy at all..."}
{"text":"They shut down now only Whitby.
Wont let me do a short review so all i can say is to bad they  closed a great central location"}
{"text":"The price point is very good. This is a great place if you like all you can eat. If you are looking for quality and freshness from sashimi cuts this is NOT the place for you. If you like rolls and cooked maki or meat dishes like tempura or ribs, This place is great. Compared to what's in ajax it does a good job. If you care about raw fish; Go further west into scarborough or even maki mono in pickering   The atmosphere is nice and clean."}
{"text":"Our old reliable \"all you can eat\" sushi place. We've been here acouple dozen times over the past couple years. They have a good selection of sushi, sashimi, maki, handrolls, udon etc. All your normal staple items, and they do them pretty well. Their grilling has improved greatly, as we find ourselves enjoying the yakitori, and various teriyaki meats (salmon, chicken, beef). There are better a la carte places in Toronto, and Markham. But this is by far the best, and most reliable \"all you can eat\" in durham region.

** Update to original review ***  Our most recent visit to Sushi Mountain was far from great. The chicken in the yakitori was spoiled. We flagged down the waitress, and informed her that the chicken was bad. My reason for lowering my prior review from 4 stars to 3 stars is based on their response the complaint. They actually challenged us, saying the chicken was fine .. and it's just that it was cooked on the grill following a batch of salmon skin. I've worked in restaurants and know when food has spoiled. Also my stomach knew also, as both my wife, and myself were mildly ill afterwards. I know this was only one disappointing visit out of many prior positive ones .. but was more disappointed at the way they handled a complaint from a frequent customer. We will give them another try .. but it might be awhile before I can convince my wife to go back."}
{"text":"Love their sushi. Beautiful presentation and great meal. A little dark in there but it's all good."}
{"text":"Not a bad place if you want AYCE sushi. Good quality and big selection. Service is great as well as the price! Slightly more selection when you order a la carte but not by much."}
{"text":"I've been struggling to write this review for almost a week now. This review is a mashup of two separate experiences.

The first:
We went for lunch ayce on a weekday ($13.99). For the price, the food is pretty good. The fish was fresh. The rice was soft. The hot foods were pretty good. The deep fried scallops were one of the best I've had at ayce (most of the time, it's almost all breading. Here, it was almost all scallop). The tempura was crispy. The crystal roll and the kingston roll were fresh and delightful (think Vietnamese cold wraps with sushi roll inspired fillings). The deep fried milk was not so great, but all in all, I wouldn't begrudge this place a four star for this review. Why not a fifth star? Well, we had a bit of a mishap. Our waitress placed a plate of tempura broccoli and mushrooms on our table. I didn't recall ordering it, but I remembered considering it, so I assumed it was ours, and grabbed a mushroom. Our waitress then came back and took the plate away, saying it wasn't ours. I let her know that I had already taken a piece of it. She said that was fine, and whisked it away, giving it to a table about three booths down from us. Yeah. I ate from a plate that she gave to her other customers. She was fine with it. We were so shocked that we kinda laughed it off...

The second:
We made a reservation for about 50 for a Saturday at around 2pm ($14.99). Their party room seats are all torn up. What I mean is that the upholstery was not just cracked but the glossy exterior was entirely missing in large chunks. It was quite unpleasant, especially because our party was there to eat our post-funeral meal for my grandmother. The food was almost as good as our first visit, except that on the red dragon rolls, there was considerably less salmon sashimi (think about two centimeters of sashimi on each roll, instead of the entire top section of the roll being draped in sashimi). The orders, however, were continually incorrect, or missing, or going to the wrong tables. Tables got rounds and rounds of food before we got any. When we got some, there were cheaper rolls (california or cucumber or mushroom) placed with our red and green dragons when we didn't order them. We got imitation crab tempura instead of calamari. We got considerably less shrimp tempura than we ordered. Not cool. Our reservation was not during peak lunch hours, and we had informed them ahead of time. They did not provide us with enough servers or service to do this reservation justice. 

Would I come again? Probably if I was in a smaller group and it was a weekday. Would I come with a large group? Definitely not."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place in Whitby, in Durham, and in GTA.
Their sushi is the best quality, their price for All-you-can-eat (AYCE) is cheaper than most places you go in Toronto. I have never had any Japanese sushi all you can eat as good as Sushi mountain, they even have drinks for free (included in the price of your all you can eat).

A++++++ QUALITY and PRICE and CONSISTENCY.

If there's 10 stars for rating, I will give them 10/10."}
{"text":"2/5 

Food was good, service was awful. We showed up an hour before it closed, but I guess they decided they were going to close an hour early so they tried to turn us away. We drove all the way from Toronto to Whitby for Sushi Mountain because my boyfriend hyped it up, but it was very underwhelming. The servers were rude, food was okay (not worth driving all the way there for), and the restaurant was dark and dirty. I will not be coming back here, ever."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow so far, but it's a full house for all you can eat lunch!

The thing about Sushi (in general) is that it's one of those things that's really easy to not get wrong, bu really difficult to get right. Sushi Mountain All you can Eat is simply a gorge yourself style menu with a very affordable price point, and although the Sushi quality is mediocre, the value is very good and balances out the experience. A full course, choose your own lunch is $15 tax in.   

I had some beef with the service (no pun intended) over some very simple things that were overlooked. For example, I found that despite how many plates I ate through and the frequent passing by's from the servers, my empty plates were left to chill out on the table. I ended up arranging them into a convenient little stack before they were finally noticed and removed. Also I found both the Dynamite and Kamakazie Rolls to be very loose and assembled haphazardly. I do understand that it is the lunch rush, but it is still worth mentioning. 

The ingredients are nothing exotic and have the more high quality items you would expect to find such as bamboo, eel, and oyster mushrooms omitted from the menu and subsequent dishes. All that being said, an All-You-Can-Eat Sushi restaurant that is local is something that every sushi loving restaurant goer likes to have in their array of known eateries, this one is mine and I will be going back.  

***** UPDATE ******

Came back this Monday with a friend and enjoyed great service and the usual menu items. I changed my rating from 3 to 4 as I cannot feel any reason for why they shouldn't be 4 stars considering the selection, value, quality, and service."}
{"text":"Completely disappointing. Used to be great. Slow. 

But worst of all it is freezing in here! I'm a fat man. I never get cold. It is easily 16 Celsius in here. 

Way to cut corners!"}
{"text":"The food was very good and so was the service. This is our first time here but we are sushi junkies so was happy to try a new place. We were very happy with our experience. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Sushi isn't bad. Not great. Not bad. Reasonably priced place for AYCE. The fact that you can order on the Just Eat app makes it a good option for quick take out lunch / dinner"}
{"text":"Sushi lunch is a good value. $16 per person And a good range of sushi and rolls to pick from. of course it is a limited menu since it's lunch, not dinner buffet.

I am giving it a two star because the sushi is really not good. it tastes like something you would get at the grocery store sushi stops. the rice is tasteless and does not hold up on its own. and the fish is room temperature... some are even warm. no thank you to warm raw fish. every roll and sushi we had was warm... it was really not appetizing..

service is nice and the place is spacious but it definitely isn't somewhere I'd return to just cause of the bad food. 

as far as sushi places go, this is one I wouldn't recommend. they've lost their touch since I see they had great reviews 2-3 years ago. head back over to Scarborough, Markham, or Toronto if you are looking for quality sushi."}
{"text":"Good food and a nice interior but they fuckin made me sick because they put eggs in my fried rice when I asked for it without eggs"}
{"text":"Sushi Mountain is in a plaza on Kingston Road and Westney - the sign is really big so it's easy to find.

We walked in and were taken to a table. It's quite spacious inside, tons of room. The decor is modern and the restaurant itself is clean. Would probably be a good place for groups.

You order off a menu and you write how much of each item you want on a form. Much more efficient than other places where you list off your 20 items to your server. The menu has a good amount of variety in rolls and types of food you can get. The food came fairly quickly and there was always something on the table. At some places I've been to food can take a while to arrive and you end up waiting for more. 

The star of the show was definitely the sashimi. I wasn't expecting much from an ayce but I definitely wasn't expecting the sashimi to be the best item of the meal. The sashimi were cut into thick pieces and very flavorful. You could see the white bands of fat very clearly in the salmon. My friends were surprised at how much I ate.

The rolls were good as well - some are pretty big! The hot items were good as well though we didn't get too much. The tempura was fresh and had a good batter to shrimp ratio. Surprisingly the ice cream was also one of the highlights. We had the red bean and green tea - the matcha taste was rich and the red bean was sweet and light. It was on the creamier rather than the icy side.

Price for dinner is about $24. Not a bad price for ayce - the GTA is generally a bit more expensive for similar quality. Had a great experience overall and I would come back."}
{"text":"Wow, Sushi Mountain just served up one of the worst sushi meals I've had in my entire life.  I walked in around 3:30 p.m. on a Saturday for a late lunch and they were already charging dinner AYCE price.  I don't particularly like AYCE for exactly what they lack.  Quality.  Against my better judgment, we decided to give SM a try since my mom was in the mood for sushi.  

We tried to order mainly from the sushi and sashimi section since that's what we were craving and the selection is soooooo limited for a $26/pp AYCE.  Needless to say, they brought out all the other food selections first (tempura, udon, salad...a.k.a the fillers) and when the fish finally arrived, I had to do a double take.  Spongy looking tilapia served as red snapper (really, SM? you really don't think patrons can tell the difference between tilapia and red snapper?), Smelly mackerel sushi that was barely held together and loads and loads of salmon and white tuna (or a.k.a butterfish).  The surf clam was the only acceptable quality and the rest just made my stomach turn.  For once, I was glad that I had ordered other \"cooked\" items at and AYCE.  I ate what I could which wasn't much, vowing never to return to SM again.  

Feel free to indulge yourself here if you want to court some serious food poisoning.  SM, you should learn to properly thaw your fish if you want to run a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the neighbourhood and was craving for our weekly sushi fix. We love ayce because my husband and I eat
Totally opposite things on the menu so it caters to both of us. Sushi mountain came recommended by friends and so we had high hopes. It was nothing special. I just tasted salt and/or soya sauce on everything! No flavor and their roles and sashimi is nothing to recommend. Going to this place ruined sushi Tuesday for my hubby and I. We will stick to our places in Toronto instead"}
{"text":"Sushi was yum. Service was good. Deep fried milk for dessert was awesome. For the all you can eat price it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"The sashimi was absolutely amazing, at perfect amount of flavor and fat that just melts in your mouth. It tasted fresh and is an absolute must try! Came all the way from Scarborough just to try it and I must say I'm impressed. The trip was worth it. The food came quite fast and the service was nice. All you can eat and drink (pop can, none of that watered down fountain drink nonsense). They have amazing ice cream too! Red bean was sweet and creamy while the green tea ice cream had a strong fragrant tea flavor, both absolutely amazing! This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Good price for all you can eat lunch. No frills service, as in they barely talk to you, but some people like that. Fresh and warm sushi, which is hard to find in Durham."}
{"text":"I tried the sushi mountain in Ajax about two years ago and was sorely disappointed. But I figured, different location, perhaps a different experience. And this time I went for dinner, so a larger menu to choose from.

My friend and I came here on a Tuesday at about 5PM. The place is very small, probably can only hold 20 people or so and was mostly empty when we arrived. It got very busy about an hour later during the dinner rush. We're no strangers to AYCE sushi, so we went to town with our usual selections.

First thing... *sigh* rolls are supposed to fit into your mouth in one go. The green dragon roll is GIGANTIC. I had to eat it in two bites and that doesn't really work so well with sushi rolls. Disappointing but well flavored and tasty just the same. The spicy salmon roll was basically chopped salmon inside a roll. Boring and I hated the texture of these; if I'd known I was going to get all the ends of the salmon chopped up and thrown in with spicy sauce, I would have passed. 

Cheese wontons were okay, but a weird shape and odd to eat. Springrolls are hard to screw up, but man... do NOT order the beef short ribs. I was talking to my friend when I took my first bite and I've never had an entire mouth full of beef fat before. I had to spit it into my napkin. When I looked at the other beef short ribs, they were all the same. Don't serve \"beef\" short ribs when they're primarily 80-90% FAT. Just call them short fat ribs instead. Gross.

The rest of the meal was uneventful and boring. The prices were good but the sushi was not. I'd take your business just south by the highway to Tatemono where you'll get better quality food and rolls you can actually fit into your mouth.

Sorry, Sushi Mountain - avoid like the plague if you want decent sushi."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We get take out here at least once a week and we've never been disappointed. Their food is fresh and well made. We love the crystal maki. We've dined in too and I think their service is great and quick. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service and most importantly it's ALL YOU CAN EAT!!! I had the veggie udon soup with avocado/cucumber rolls, the cheese wontons were a really nice and sweet twist as well as some veggie tempura. All of which were absolutely delicious. The staff were also very amazing and kind. I would definitely recommend going to this restaurant for people who live in the Durham area or those who are just passing through the Whitby area and need something good to eat. Definitely not be disappointed eating here. What else can I say this place is so great!"}
{"text":"Came here for a girls night and was very disappointed.

We came for all you can eat and 1st of all the service was terrible, 2nd bathrooms were dirty.

The over the top to make me write this was a friend of mine ordered a roll and left one piece on her plate and they charged her for the whole roll! 

They also gave us a roll that tasted a bit off and when we told the waitress she said if we don't eat she will charge, after 10 minutes of arguing the manager came and said no charge after I said I just won't pay!"}
{"text":"It's right around the corner from my house so it's often the default sushi place. Because it's not great, the service can be slow, there's so much mayo used in the rolls and the sushi temperature for the raw can be too warm.

But the tempura's good and the ice cream and green salad are good.

Serviceable sushi, ask them to hold the mayo."}
{"text":"They have one of the lowest priced AYCE menu around, but their food presentation is sub-par. 

Their food was okay on certain parts, but it did not have much flavour.

I do like that their special maki rolls come in smaller quantities than any other places I've been to, allowing for more variety if you don't want to fill up on one specific type."}
{"text":"We have been back to Sushi Mountain many times after trying Edamame in Pickering (yucky) and Umi Sushi (was good)...and Dragon Rolls in Pickering was too expensive and had poor reviews.  So we love SM very much.  Service has been great and food is always fresh!!!"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular until recently. The service both dining in and for take out has gone downhill! The quality of their sushi/maki is so bad lately. The food is not fresh and the rolls are so loose that I cannot even pick them up with my hand and they fall apart! Last time I tried to order take out they told me their menu had changed and I was no longer allowed to pick what kind of making I wanted in my party tray!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, fresh fish, reasonable price, great quick service!! My girlfriend and I left the restaurant happily satisfied."}
{"text":"If you have every eaten at a good ACE place you would know this was not good at all. 

Their meat was horrible and flavourless. Especially their BBQ ribs they were inedible! None of us could manage to shallow the whole thing, we had to spit it out. It had a very strange and disgusting flavour to it, perhaps it was it was rotten meat.. Not too sure.
Their green salad was weird, usually it's more of a vinaigrette but their dressing was creamy and gross, nobody was able to finish their salad either.
 
Their tempura sauce was bland, their tempura shrimp was one of the only thing we liked. The spider roll was also one of their better sushi rolls. 

Pros
Tempura shrimp
Spider roll 
Fried Dumpling 
Fast service (everything came out super fast)

Cons 
Food was not fresh
Meat was bad tasting and flavourless
Sushi was did not taste right 
Teriyaki sauce is flavourless and very watery 
Some of the things we ordered never came 
The food made me sick after eating it"}
{"text":"This is my second go-to sushi place. The sushi tastes so fresh and delicious and the portions are huge! I brought my infant daughter in and they were super nice and sweet to her and we're very child friendly. The only downside of this place is just the actual size of the restaurant is pretty small so things can get cramped and loud! Other than that, this is a wonderful and delicious restaurant!"}
