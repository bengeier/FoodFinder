{"text":"I don't understand why this restaurant has such bad reviews. I live next door so I pick up food fairly often. Everything I've tried has been really tasty. (General Tao, shrimp in lobster sauce, noodles, sushi...)"}
{"text":"Soba Sushi is located along Sherbrooke in the middle of Westmount faces nearby competition. Walking along the street, I didn't even notice the place until my friend pointed it out. Walking in, I noticed how small it was (seats around 30), but they had a huge amount of chefs working in the kitchen (around 8). This probably means that they were mainly focused on the take-out business. Our group of four were seated quickly. The menu is quite large for a small place. You got your choices of sushi, but also your traditional Chinese take-out as well. I ordered deep-fried pork chops with fried rice, vegetables, spring roll, and a Wonton soup. Food came out quickly (around 5 to 10 minutes). The Wonton soup was disappointing (too much wrapping and the meat was bland). The main course, however, was good. Fried rice was done correctly (not too oily and tasted good). The spring roll was crispy and the filling inside was ample. The vegetables were steamed (nothing noteworthy). The pork chops themselves were great (not too much batter, meat temperature was perfect, just slightly spicy). Portion wise, I thought it was perfect, but my friend could not finish half of his Pad Thai. My friend who ordered the sushi said they weren't bad. All in all, for the location and the price I paid (lack of atmosphere, okay food, good portions), this restaurant does an okay job."}
{"text":"fresh sushi, great general tao and other chinese dishes, very tasty and a great value all around. their service is good and they're quite accomadating."}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative comments below.... I've been to soba once a week for 3 years now, bringing family and different friends everytime, and honestly I have nothing but good things to say. The food is amazing (both portion and taste) .the service is fast, friendly and super effective. They are so consistent which I find is a very important key element in restaurant . They have a sushi and szechuan cuisine with over a hundred items on the menu. My favorites are the dragon eyes, harakiri, pop, pork chops, hunan dumplings. There are many more in their specialty rolls as well as hot meal combos. It's amazing how much food they pump out and serve. Their staff consist of approximately 15-18 people for a restaurant that hold maybe 40 seat....that's insane! However it is very popular in the ndg westmount area so the deliveries must be booming too"}
{"text":"Nice people, cheap prices but you truly get what you pay for as it's not the next tasting Chinese food.. lots of variety though"}
{"text":"Still my favorite sushi to go place of all times, been around many cities however there's none like soba. Extremely efficient service with delicious melt in mouth salmon sashimi. I was really hoping they have a chain restaurant but this is the only one."}
{"text":"Soba has always been the most consistent restaurant I've ever been, which I believe to be a very important factor. I really enjoy their food weather it's at the diner/ take out/ delivery. they have a very impressive and vast menu to satisfy sushi lover and szechuan dishes. I like the local family vibe I get everytime, service always welcoming, sashimi always fresh, and the home made taste is so refreshing and heart warming in every bite. waiting time is relatively short for sushi restaurant, pick up is around 15 min and delivery is about 45 min, pretty standard for a business that's so popular in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered sushi for dinner, arrived two hours later warm, soggy and inedible. Really gross, not worth the time or money"}
{"text":"Sushi are good, but they have too many orders, so they are messing with ingridients often."}
{"text":"I don't understand the poor reviews below. We ordered sushi from there and it was great. The rolls were fresh, large and not stuffed with rice. The octopus salad was amazing! Just wouldn't recommend their spicy rolls, too much tempura. Their smoked salmon with salmon roll however were great."}
{"text":"Ahhhh, sometimes I wonder about my decision making skills, tonight was one of those nights. I was in a sushi mood but it was 10:30 and not too many options at this hour nearby. Mikado's, my first choice, was too late for pick up, I would have settled for sushi shop but they were closed. As I drove down Sherbrooke I saw Soba  and Noodles, they were still open and quite a few people were inside, I quickly thought over my options, which were pick up something  at Metro or McDonald's, neither one appealing.  I had my heart set on sushi and I should have waited till tomorrow but I was in a stubborn mood and thought, what the hell, can't be that bad so I parked and went in.  The staff was nice and I could see the cooks working and I  didn't get a super clean feeling but it was too late for much else so I ordered.   I'm not really into  rolls, so I ordered Nigiri, eel, red snapper, salmon and yellowtail tuna. Against my better judgement I decided to check out their reviews on yelp while I waited, oh no , not good...mediocre and someone got really sick. I already paid and my order my order was ready so I surrendered to the experience...I got into my car and  I peeked into my container and felt that the rice was warm, hate that...as for smell, seemed ok.  I got home and quickly dove in, free of expectations. Not great... Big slabs of mediocre fish on huge slabs of warm rice, not the melt in your mouth experience I was in the mood for. The ginger had an overly sweet, chemical taste which didn't help either.   All in all, it's one of those places that serves up a ton of food, too many choices to truly excell at anything in particular.  I obviousky wasnt expecting amazing but i wasn't impressed, I won't be coming back...."}
{"text":"They have a bit of everything. I recommend the Sushi Pizza, hot and sour soup, and I hear their General Tao is v good."}
{"text":"So I recently revisited soba, they have added some additional items on their menu  such as the octopus salad! This time I tried their salt and pepper porc chops and black pepper crispy spinach chicken, it was an orgasm and a half I tell you! Must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food for an excellent price! Food is always fresh and tastes delicious! I love their fried rice and sushi! Yum! Plus side, they deliver if you're around the area!"}
{"text":"A great \"go to\" restaurant for something fast and easy. They have a really large menu, and everything I have tried so far has been good! This place is not fancy, but is always reliable. A Sunday dinner favourite in our home. I reccomend the General Tao, and the Hunan Dumplings. The sushi is also a good choice here."}
{"text":"Hello. I used to love soba. Ordered it once a week. Last time I ordered the spicy tuna roll I proceeded to vomit for 4 hours straight and had to be taken to the hospital. Vomiting all over myself as well as uncontrollable diarrhea all over the bed non stop until 8am.  NEVER. AGAIN. not worth the risk of pooing yourself"}
{"text":"I don't get to go too often because of the abundance of other sushi restos but it's always been good. I would suggest trying the \"Volcano\" -very good!"}
{"text":"A friend brought me here for lunch.  A small local hole in the wall place with an extensive menu of Asian dishes including sushi.  Service was friendly and the food came out super quick, a bonus when you have to get back to work after lunch!    I had the vegetarian tofu curry.  Lots of fresh veggies and nice big chunks of fried tofu, but the sauce was very oily and I didn't really get any curry flavour.  My friend said her General Tao chicken was good.    Not a bad spot to grab a quick lunch or take out but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Listen, don't expect 5* food but for one of very few Chinese food joints, I'm glad to have this in my area.   This is my third time trying it. I really like the szechuan shrimp plate, the hunan veggie dumplings, the spring rolls, the chicken pad thai and the peanut chicken wasn't bad.  Getting a combo essentially means you're getting 1/2 portion of curry, 1/2 portion of fried rice, a large soup + a spring roll so it's worth it if you're really hungry and like variety. I feel limited by the combo so prefer to get random appetizers and entrees but then the price goes way up.  For $30, you can eat for 2 and be very full.   *Note that it's cash or debit only."}
{"text":"For the price, which is around the same as my usual place, I would expect better quality. Rice crispies are used in place of tempura, which I don't like. It is not bad, but it is not great. I'd suggest getting sushi elsewhere. I only had the sushi, so I can't comment on the other food, but they do have a large selection of dishes."}
{"text":"Wow.....Soba was recommended to me by a,  lets say a hefty eater. Usually you would think,  \" well they know what there talking about\". Boom,  not so. This has to be one be one of the worst places for asian. Everything taste the same,  and there veggies in the dishes come from a frozen bag in the freezer isle of IGA. Come on !!!!! I had hopes,  gone.....  Sushi,  well,  so so.  Not impressed... Wait,  almost forgot the delivery,  like a slow COOKER. Order early and wait patiently.  MoeFactor 4 on 10"}
{"text":"Ordered some sushi for pick up on Just-eat.com. When I arrived, the staff was punctual and the food was already packaged. Upon arrival at home, I was pleasantly surprised that the sushi was not over-packed with rice, unlike so many other sushi restaurants in Montreal who think we won't notice.  Cheap, fast, and palatable sushi! I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Kickass Chinese food, sushi isn't fantastic but the Chinese food (like general Tao and the combos) are super tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is delicious, they even managed to make vegetables appealing to me, now that means something! But seriously, the hot food is always excellent. I don't eat sushis so I can't pronounce myself on that, but for everything else, I have absolutely no complains. Big portions, flavourful dishes, and really balanced prices. I've been on a lifelong hunt for the best peanut butter sauce dumplings, and so far, SOBA is leading, sooooooo good. The only problem with this place is it always feel hectic, it's small and they have a bunch of employees crammed behind the cash register, but once you're seated, you forget about it quick."}
{"text":"Eaten here for years - always a consistent experience of super tasty food.  Almost never eat-in because we used to live around the corner, but the sushi was always fresh tasting, delicious, and a great price.  A constant favorite is the Fried Calamari with garlic and pepper, it feels like it disappears like magic before we even get to sit down.  Love it here!!!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Fresh tasty sushi and hot dishes.  I have been going to and ordering from this restaurant for several years now and they have yet to disappoint.  If you go, you must get their wafu salad. They make the best wafu I have ever tasted it's like liquid crack.  The sushi is made to order and is palate pleasing. They are extremely generous with their avacado for the rolls that have them, which is not something many sushi places do. I recommend their Tamago and Inari as well as their vegetarian. I'm sure their fish sushi is delicious. However, I am not a fan anything that comes from a body of water so I cannot vouch for any rolls containing fish.  I used to get their terriyaki chicken combo. Soup, salad, sticky rice, and tasty teriyaki chicken. I would always be pleasantly surprised when it also came with friend tempura vegetables. And all for a ridiculously cheap price.  If you are looking for fresh, delicious, affordable sushi. Soba is a great choice that also provides a variety of other succulent dishes."}
{"text":"For the hungry and cheap, this place is pretty awesome. Though it may not be totally authentic (I'm pretty sure they use rice krispies instead of tempura crumbs), it's also pretty delicious and relatively cheap. If you're going, get the Great Wall roll and the Spicy Tuna."}
{"text":"Big portions, not expensive, and very tasty. Been there since I was a young teen, and revisited it now at age 31, and they're still very tasty. I liked how their general Tao chicken had not just a lot of chicken, but each piece was very meaty. I've tasted a better sauce at another place before, but their chicken was never as good as here. Felt like very good quality. Their sushi is also nice, but very plain themes because of the low prices. At least everything tasted fresh and was well made. I'd be interested in seeing them have more specialty sushi's on their menu, I don't mind if they would have to charge higher prices for it, it would just be nice, because I find it kind of hard to find a fancy sushi place in Montreal that wasn't in an upscale expensive restaurant. Nice atmosphere here, casual, and I like their new renovations. The waiters were really attentive and helped us order exactly what we wanted. I also liked how their menus had a lot of pictures, that always helps."}
{"text":"Didn't get the sushi here, got the chinese food (sweet and sour pork combo)  The combo feels kinda cheap, the soup is good but the spring roll they give you tastes horrible.  The main dish was alright, not great but not bad, mediocre chinese food but big portions for the price.  The service was great though, our waiter was very courteous, pleasant, and attentive to refill our water. Came here another separate time with a large group and the waitress that time was also very nice.   Overall, I'd say Service = 10 Food = 6 Atmosphere = 6 (small and cozy, kind of cold in the winter though)"}
{"text":"Si vous etes de passage et pressé why not ? il y a pire. Ce que je peux dire c'est que j'ai observé la cuisine et ca parait tres propre."}
{"text":"The service is exceptionally fast. I've been 3 times now, and every time I have been impressed with how quickly my order was taken and brought to me, and how attentive the servers are. The food is also very good, and in fact the sushi is among my favorite. The only downside is that they only take debit or cash."}
