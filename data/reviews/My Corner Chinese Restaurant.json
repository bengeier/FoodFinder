{"text":"We went as a group of seven.  We read the review that said the food wasn't good and thought we would give it a try anyways. We now regret that decision, this isn't a place you want to go at all.  The sauces were not good, the spring rolls had a really bad aftertaste like the water was contaminated by minerals and chemicals. The service was great, thus the one star. One member of our group liked her meal and had no complains, 6 out of seven recommend staying away."}
{"text":"Ordered a few items. Everything was extremely greasy or sickly sweet. We felt so sick after a few minutes that we tossed out the left overs which we never do with Chinese."}
{"text":"It was okay. Make sure you have them repeat your order. We didn't get both orders of egg rolls and our vegetable fried rice was regular fried rice. Also, like someone else said, there's cabbage at the bottom of the box."}
{"text":"Called in an order for kung pao shrimp and sesame chicken.  When I arrived the dining area stunk of sewage.  Glad I wasn't eating in.  Order was brought out, I paid and left.  When I got home I picked up my order and everything fell out the bottom.  The sesame chicken spilled over and saturated the bag and the seat.  Spent the next 15 minutes cleaning up the car and moving stuff inside. Got inside and found that the Kung pao sauce had saturated through the containers.  Since we lost all the sauce the food was very bland and mushy. Ended up throwing everything out.  Called to complain but the lady who answered didn't speak English and wouldn't transfer me to her son who does.   Won't go back."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant for the first time tonight. And the food was horrible. There was absolutely no flavor in the chicken. We got the Mongolian beef and it wasn't spicy at all. Then we also found a metal shaving from a metal bristle brush that they probably use to clean something with. I had to check my kids foods to ensure that there was no other metal particles. Their service was awesome and they did not miss a beat. Delivery was on time."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible!!!  Purchased lunch take out on Christmas eve for myself & Daughter,  the rice was old, orange chicken was dry, & the house lo-main was awful,  after 2 bites I decided it was a complete loss. I would not allow my daughter to taste the food. I took pictures  (will attempt to attach) and tossed the food  $18+, in the trash. Lesson learned"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here. This is our favorite Chinese Restaurant. Service is very friendly and kind, and the food tastes great. So far, I have tried their orange chicken, sesame chicken, cashew chicken, and sweet and sour chicken, and their hot and sour soup, egg drop soup, and won ton soup. Always a memorable and good meal eating here for us."}
{"text":"Don't know why my previous review of 5 stars isn't here. Makes me want to rate Yelp.

This restaurant has been perfect for delivery. The food is great. The prices are reasonable. The service is pleasant. And the delivery is always on time.

Not much to choose from in this corner of Glendale, except for Panda. My Corner is awesome, and my neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been long-time customer.    :-)   I have actually been a customer since they have opened. I can say, with much confidence, they are always improving! The price is very much affordable. The delivery has always been on time. They treat U with respect. ...and that's all I have to say about that. Enjoy.

{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has so many bad reviews- but it may be because we ordered safe choices, so our food was good? We got delivery today, they did take 45 minutes so that was a downside. We got the Orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken. Both hard to ruin entrees. Food was hot and good. Previous reviews had me worried that the food would be nasty but it wasn't.

Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars was because they put my drink in the bag with my hot food so the soda was watered down and they only gave us 1 container of rice for 2 entrees."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The flavors are pretty decent but when we ordered our food the portions aren't as big as other places and in the bottom of our orange chicken about 1/4 of it was cabbage. Who does that on delivery? The coupons are misleading. They are not full orders of entrees. The beef and broccoli just looked weird. Didn't look like beef. Not a super bad place just others are better. We will go back to our staple delivery."}
{"text":"i ordered the sweet and sour pork, the pork tasted kind of funny not sure if it was pork or not."}
{"text":"I tried this place for three reasons. 1)  I've been searching for a better Chinese food restaurant than where we go now. 2) Several weeks ago someone dropped off a menu at our house. 3) Decided to try something new. 

Delivery took only 25 minutets and the food arrived very hot. 

My wife ordered the beef with broccoli. I ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce. My wife took one bite and said the beef was tough and the broccoli was hard (it wasn't coooked enough). She also said her dish smelt weird. At that point I dug into my shrimp & lobster sauce. It was more like egg drop soup than any shrimp and lobster sauce dishe I have ever tried anywhere. I also paid extra and got fried rice instead of white rice. It was so bland it was inedible. Everything went  immediately in the trash

We  also ordered  Wor Wonton Soup and got a free entree which we were planning on having for lunch or dinner tomorrow. Since we put the entrees in the trash nd were hungry we decided to give the soup a try. There was large chunks of pork in the soup which looked good but after trying a piece I was sure that was not how the meat was supposed to taste. My wife agreed and we ended pouring it down the drain. We then tried the free almond chicken entree.  Again the dish was nothing short of  disgusting! so it went directly into the trash as well.

FOOD: wanted to really enjoy it, but honestly, the food was detestable. We both  nearly gagged just after tasting it. To say our food was dissatisfactory is an understatement. STAY AWAY!!!! PRICE: Wasn't worth the price even if it was free.. SERVICE: Fast delivery.  CONCLUSION:  I have rarely been this disappointed with a restaurant . If I could give this place 0 stars I would. This is the worst chinese restaurant ever!



Dinner cost $28.37 and it ALL went down the drain or in the trash. I will never order from this establishment again. STAY AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst chinese food I've ever had. They left a flyer on our door so we figured we would try them out. Not only was our food horrible and tasted like it was heavily microwaved but the person that delivered it didn't bring any kind of change so we were forced to tip 9$ on a 41 dollar bill. They were very rude when we called back and mentioned that they forgot one of our sides of rice but did eventually bring it. Very unprofessional and horrible tasting food."}
{"text":"I read reviews on this place before i ordered & some people dont know good food!!!!it was awful!  the fried shrimp was  soggy & not cleaned (what kinda place gives you dirty shrimp) had the house fried rice T the mea tasted old as dirty shoes****if you go by the reviews listen to me & DO NOT GO HERE!!!!i want my 30$ back"}
{"text":"Stopped into this neighborhood place to order and take out dinner. Sweetest woman took my order then told me it would be ready in 15 mins. I sat to wait and in less than 10 my order was ready, brought it home and it was perfect. Thank you for your great customer service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Today 8/1/17 
My mother and i tried for the first time My Chinese corner resturant. 
I got the shrimp and vegetables combination  lunch platter and my mom got the kung pao beef lunch combination as well. The accommodation were on point. Nothing was missing but the food was not good. 
Crab angels Bland with no imitation crab
Shrimp with vegetables no flavor bland
Spicy mustard not spicy no flavor
Egg rolls over fried 
Fried rice was very good and thats about it. 
Even my fortune cookies were stale :-(
Sad to say, we wont be returning. Thank you for fast service and great accommodations without anything missing."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food. The people I interacted with were friendly and helpful and love the fact that they deliver. I would definitely order again!"}
{"text":"This has been my go to Chinese food spot for the Last two years. I would recommend them to everyone! If you like HOT & SOUR soup, they have the best my husband or I have ever had and super quick with delivery! Hands down the BEST CHINESE FOOD! Plus the staff is so nice and helpful. I can't say enough good things about this place. MY CORNER CHINESE I LOVE YOUR FOOD. THANK YOU FOR BEING SO RELIABLE!"}
{"text":"Being as nice as possible I have to say this is a below average Chinese Restaurant so I am rounding it UP to two stars  ONLY because of the extreme cleanliness and the attentive server .

I was going to order the Szechuan Chicken but the server informed me that they make it with fried chicken so I thought I wouldn't like it and ordered Vegetable Chop Suey instead . I couldn't watch them cook but heard almost no noise from the kitchen and my meal was out within a couple minutes  (maybe two?) . It seemed like the vegetables and rice were precooked and someone poured heated chicken stock over it . I am trying  NOT to to be mean but It seemed and tasted liked microwave cookery  . Most of the vegetables didn't seem like fresh ones like the awful canned bamboo shoots and the pre cut very possibly bagged broccoli , potato chip shape cut carrots with snow pea mix , but two fresh vegetables were the button mushroom and cabbage . Even the steamed ( steamed ?) rice didn't taste good , each rice grain was sort of dried out . (maybe old?)

My husband had one of the Beef Lunches that are mostly priced at $4.50 or $4.95 . It came out two or three minutes after mine and had the same vegetables but in a brown sauce that tasted very strong of uncooked beef base . The lunch menu includes soup , won ton  , and egg roll , The soup was very thick with too much corn starch and the won ton was EMPTY . 

Maybe someone new was trying to cook that day ."}
{"text":"Good and inexpensive Chinese food.  We have been eating here for several years, and have always had enjoyable food that is prepared fresh and served piping hot.  The service is outstanding, their egg drop soup, spring rolls and shrimp fried rice are among our favorite dishes here.  Another one to try is the Ma po bean curd which is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch the other day. Quiet little independent Chinese restaurant that also has a Hawaiian style menu.

Not many options for vegetarians, no tofu dishes to be found. Didn't really dig my noodles + veggies + pineapple dish, hence the 2 star rating."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant about 10 years ago, and we get back whenever we can! Always professional, courteous service. The food is fantastic! He's trying the pineapple beef; my favorites are the house chicken or shrimp w/lobster sauce & veggies (tonight's dish). Have to order crab angels when we come. It's a great family-owned restaurant & wonderful experience every time we're here!"}
{"text":"Was not pleased with the food or the service. It took an hour and half to arrive, it was cold. Then to top it off they filled half the kariout box of orange chicken with cabbage. I would think for near $8 each portion there would be a full box of food. To top it off there was no white rice but a full container of brownish rice that would not pass for fried in any kitchen."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food at a great price in North Phoenix.

They have a coupon you can't beat - \"Free Entree after spending $18\"  The \"free entree\" is a limited selection but when you can get 3 entrees and an appetizer for $20 you're doing great.  Big portions that always leave left overs.

We have eaten here twice for pick up and been very satisfied.  Only negative thing I can say is that my wife was disappointed with her chow mein/ \"crunchy noodles\"  as the noodles were not what she was expecting.  We called the resaurant to ask about it and the owner explained that that's what they were supposed to be...they weren't wrong, but she wasn't exactly concerned with correcting our disappointment in the meal (was hoping that maybe she'd offer some noodles/rice?  Not her fault that we'd never had \"crunchy noodles\", so still gets 5 stars.

We will definitely be back, but ALWAYS have the coupon, it's on their menu."}
{"text":"First time eating here tonight. My chicken and Chinese vegetables tasted great until halfway through found a hair stuck to a piece of chicken. Thick black short hair. Stuck in the chicken. Gross. 
Will be our last time eating here. I know accidents happen but cooks are supposed to wear hats or hair nets.  Bad first impression."}
{"text":"Very good food and the service is great. Yes there is one little lady that looks like she does everything but she is always polite and takes good care of us. We enjoy coming here. Try it at least once."}
{"text":"This was our go-to Chinese restaurant 'back in the day'. We were in the area and decided to stop in. Big mistake. We ordered three lunch specials and shared. Sweet & Dour chicken was okay. Chow mien was bland. But I believe it was the Mongolian beef that actually made me sick. It was slimy and gross and, fortunately, I'm the only one who tried it. Should have been a clue that we were the only ones there at lunchtime. This place has gone downhill, and we won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is so bad. The rice is hard. It looks like they just heat up the food and served it. Worst dining experience ever!"}
{"text":"We ordered 4 of the lunch specials to be delivered and all were very good! Two Egg Foo Young's, Sweet and Sour Pork and a Shrimp Lo Mein, all came piping hot and were more then we could eat!"}
{"text":"I order pork fried rice pork lo main and chicken and vegetables the food is very good !!!"}
{"text":"Try lunch here! Good food for a fair price!  Very attentive wait staff!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the 3rd time today, last time I ordered wasn't so great took a long time (which they did advise me of before I ordered) and my food was kind of cold when it got here. I figured everyone has their off days and I tried again today. Everything was hot, delicious and they got here in 30 mins when they told me 45 on the phone. Give them a try."}
