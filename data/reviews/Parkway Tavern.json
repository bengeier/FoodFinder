{"text":"First visit there was a disappointment.
Service was friendly and fast.
Food was disappointing... But didn't try the pizza or hoagies... 
Wife and I had Italian pasta meals and they tasted like Nuked tv dinners.  No veggie side ... Skimpy on the side of pasta... Sauce bland...
Atmosphere nothing great.
Got better Italian meals at chain restaurants like Eat'n Park & Kings...
Probably won't go back..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite and regular visits for dinner when I am traveling and near Monroeville. They have the best hamburger dinner in the area, hands down."}
{"text":"This place just opened today!  I tried the brick oven pizza and was blown away!  If you are tired of all the chain restaurants in Monroeville, you need to try this out.  The food prices are amazing and the quality is top notch.  We had very fast and friendly service. but please do yourself a favor and try the pizza....Nothing close to it in the area........."}
{"text":"Honestly, I felt like I was taking a bit of a gamble on this place.  The reviews aren't too endorsing and I haven't been having a ton of success with trying new places for lunch.  That being said I was hesitant.  I went to this establishment years ago when it was Luccia Shea's.  Overall, I recall being disappointed with my experience and didn't return.  With this establishment moving in I figured sure why not.


So I went with the \"cluck cluck\" (grilled chicken sandwich) $8.50.  It came with chips I asked if I could sub them out and of course she says no.  I said I would pay a difference to which she says yes, but really all this meant as I found out later, you can add any side to your meal at the price listed in the menu, and your sandwich will still come with chips.  Thanks, clearly I knew I could do that.  SO I added steamed broccoli (I believe $2.50), the VOTD.  

Atmosphere wasn't bad.  We sat at the bar to eat.  Our food didn't take too long to come out.  My broccoli was really good.  A nice al dente, some seasonings and warm.  I ate that first.  I made a comment to the bartender that I didn't want the chips remember, but she was kind of like, \"oh well, they are on there.\" Yep they were.  My sandwich was pretty standard.  I was disappointed with the portion of chicken.  It was sliced super thin.  The toppings were all fresh but seriously one of the best parts was the bun.  Oh my, it was good.  Tasted freshly made that day.  Nice and soft and flavorful.  Not sure where they buy them from but they should keep it up.   

Overall a solid A-Okay place, probably would go again."}
{"text":"The new Parkway Tavern is just ok.  We had wings, which were not good.  They were small with not much flavor.  The fries we ordered were just ok.  The fries are shoe string style if you like those kind.  Pizza was about the best part of the meal and in compared to other places that have pizza it would be considred very average.  We probably wont be back."}
