{"text":"Service is extremely slow even when you call ahead. Staff not friendly and some food items are expensive and come in  small portions. Not going back again."}
{"text":"Best roti and doubles that I have ever tasted, but the service could be faster. I often call ahead and yet still have to wait up to 15 min for my order when I get there, but still this is my favourite Roti place in Ajax!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend got me a beef wrap roti from here and let me tell you it was just like being back home in Trinidad. Excellent. Can't wait to have some more."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Roti and Curry in the GTA. So flavourful not dry at all. The pepper sauce is actually spicy which I love! I always get extra. So amazing!"}
{"text":"Best doubles and rotis in Ajax. I used to go to drupatis and kiskedee but not anymore (sorry not sorry). This place is much cleaner and serves was tastier and less greasy food. The staff is also very friendly and willing to answer any questions you might have. 
I've only ordered takeout roti but they also have specials on plates and sweets."}
{"text":"Best goat roti in the Durham area! Great flavor and fully loaded with delicious potato and boneless goat - definitely a full meal! Service is great and quick. Will have to try the doubles and jerk next time."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today and their doubles are pretty good! Only thing I really have to say is the place is A bit expensive! Their doubles was $1.80 and all the rotis were over $10 some people could walk out there spending minimum $20 or more if you order something big but I think it taste pretty good I'll go back there and try the roti and see if it's worth the price. I'll definitely come back and buy the doubles when I'm feeling hungry and I want a little snack!"}
{"text":"Best Roti I've eaten in Durham!  And I've ate at almost all the places in Durham.  very friendly and their doubles are good.  get there early and many things run out!"}
{"text":"Very tasty....tried the boneless jerk chicken roti, a chicken roti and doubles. 

Everything was very tasty and flavourful. Large portions and I felt the price very reasonable for authentic, home-cooked style food. 

Ordering/payment process could use some tweaking as there was a lot of confusion and a somewhat long wait for food. Speaking with other patrons who are regulars, this is apparently a constant occurrence."}
{"text":"Best place for Caribbean food ever! The best doubles ever! ... staff is so nice! ... the pepper sauce is the best!
My favourite place."}
{"text":"I tried Taste of T & T for the first time today and it was amazing! I got the regular size jerk chicken dinner, which came with a choice of rice & beans or a roti, and what I believe to be curried potatoes. I love jerk chicken and get it with rice and beans every time, but the curried potatoes is something i'd never had before and it was delicious! Portions are about average for jerk chicken dinners and it included 4 pieces of chicken. I'm not even finished eating but I wanted to come online and tell you all how great the food is! (I also wanted to give my mouth a rest from the heat :p ). Anyways, definitely a great place to check out if you like Caribbean food! I'll definitely be going back!!"}
