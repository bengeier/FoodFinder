{"text":"Great food and service! We got the ginger crispy beef, ho fen veggie noddles and mango and coconut bubble tea and everything was amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The service was reasonable. The food was amazing, it tasted great and the quantity was good. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment. The dishes that claimed \"HEAT\" - lacked. The General Tao Chicken similar to a person who had been submerged in water for a LONG period of time.. I am not sure if it was supposed to be deep fried - and someone failed miserably -- or exactly WHAT was going on. The Ginger chicken didn't taste like Ginger at all.. The beef and broccoli had more broccoli than beef - and the broccoli was HARD. The Wonton soup was tasty - which was the only thing that was okay. 

All of the dishes must have TONS of MSG. We only ate a little of the food (all else went in the GARBAGE unfortunately) -- but we were STUFFED - in a very unsettling way. This place was a waste of time and money. Never again.."}
{"text":"Had fish pakora and shanghai noodles with an egg roll, my husband had the ginger chicken. All of it was really hot, tasty and quickly served."}
{"text":"The food looked good and tasted okay. But after eating, it made me thirsty and my stomach bit upset. Not sure if its something in the ingredient such as too much MSG or something else.

Service was bad. Slow, no waiters came to ask how the food is or offer water refills. The restaurant was not that busy so that is disappointing. 

I don't like the service or food but I keep coming back here to get take out.

UPDATE: Make sure you read your RECEIPTS carefully.. they seem to automatically add a service fee/tip."}
{"text":"Really tasty Manchurian style chicken, whether as a side or a whole order. Pretty large portions, ask for light sauce. Would definitely also recommend the noodles, obviously, and even the vegetable sides are good. They are willing to accommodate allergies, which is a plus."}
{"text":"I've eaten here for 4 years now. The bad reviews are based on personal experience with staff. I go here to eat and if you want great service all the time go to a fine dining establishment and pay for it!!!

But he food here is great! ... i always have the Chili Chicken Dry, it's crispier than the wet version. The soups are great as is most all the dishes. I have never had a bad experience with the quality of the dishes.

I've moved away from the area and can't find any Hakka restaurant that beats it. So i return here for my Hakka experience. 

believe me I've eaten here more than 50 times and i always have a great food experience. 

For me it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Food was great. Ordered the chili chicken, spicy garlic chicken, Manchurian chicken, couldn't tell that much of a difference between the chili & Manchurian chickens. Very affordable, so don't expect 5 star service or accommodations, just good food!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a zero star. Food is good but the girl that's taking the order she as pure attitude she's rude and disrespectful I believe she needs to get laid that's why she's always miserable- I wrote a bad review about the girl that works there and her bad attitude, she ad changed for a wile, I'm guessing some one ad spoke to her then, she was better with her attitude but now she started again, I would love for the owner of this place to send some one with a hidden camera and recording her for a day she gives everyone attitude including the people that calls to place orders. Place its not bad and food it's good but I'm not going to give more then one star just because of that woman so ill suggest the owner to get ever of her and trust me I'm not the only one to complain about her,"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the negative reviews here. My parents and I went here for lunch recently and we thought everything was just fine. Yes, the portions are a little smaller than at some other places, like Super Hakka, and the Chili Chicken was not spicy at all, but it still had flavour. The female server who greeted us and took our orders was very friendly and nice. The male server who cleared our table and brought our bill did not smile, but I wouldn't say he was rude, just neutral (neither nice nor not nice). They did not automatically add the tip to our bill like some other reviewers mentioned - although we were just a party of three, maybe they do this if your party is larger(?) 

We ordered from the Lunch Special Menu. I had the Bombay Chicken (dry) - $6.95, my dad had the Mango Tango Beef - $6.95 and my mom had the Chili Chicken (dry) - $5.95. All lunch specials come with a vegetarian spring roll and a bottle of water.

The spring roll was average sized. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was filled with cabbage, onions and carrots. It was pretty standard. I loved my Bombay Chicken. It was spicy hot and had a great combination of spices in it. I loved the dry chrunchy bits. The Mango Tango Beef was tender and came with green and red peppers as well as slices of sweet ripe mango. The sauce was sweet and was a nice contrast to the spicy Bombay Chicken. The Chili Chicken had flavour but it wasn't spicy at all. I don't understand why on menu the Chili Chicken is rated as spicy as the Bombay Chicken (2 chilies). Anyway, the Chili Chicken was my least favorite, but it was still OK and my mom who doesn't like really spicy food actually really liked it.

The white steamed rice was nicely cooked but not all that plentiful. Portions are a bit smaller than other places.

Overall it's a good place to go if you are in the area and have a craving for Hakka food. Lots of free parking in the strip mall parking lot."}
{"text":"Horrible food with horrible customer service. They use tofu as a filler as opposed to real chicken in all of their dishes. I would never recommend any of their locations to any one. I can pay same amount of money to a better Hakka Chinese restaurant located in DownTown Toronto or Chung Moi Restaurant in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Hakka no. 1 is the no. 1 alternate to driving all the way to Brampton or Mississauga or Scarborrough in search of good Hakka food. 

I was fooled by the cover of the book, and was assuming the worst when I finally decided to give this place a try. 

But to my amazing surprise, the restaurant was the exact opposite of what I feared. It was clean, well organized seating, good staff and delicious well cooked Hakka food. 

The prices are the cherry on top. Delicious and more than filling lunch options for under $10......how can anyone complain after that?? The lunch menu offers so many options, that you don't even need to bother with the main menu during lunch hours 

Finally coming to the food:
Hakka noodles were great, flavourful, and a generous portion. Ordered Bombay chicken with fried rice. (You can change steam rice from the original combo to fried rice for a dollar and half). Bombay chicken was crispy fried, very well marinated and flavourful, tossed in green herbs. An amazing preparation. If anyone knows and misses \"chicken kebabs of Bangalore\", this dish comes really really close to it. 
Overall, dining here was a great experience and I found this place to be a wonderful find in Midtown Toronto. 
This will be a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that within its massive menu there are a few gems. The Bombay chicken, pakora, rice or noodle dishes are quite savory and have never disappointed the few times I have been here. Portions are very big and a single dish can be shared by at least 3 people. However, this is where the positive review ends. Whenever, I have tried to wander off and be adventurous it has proved to be a bad idea. Most of the gravy dishes are waay too salty and the meat lacking in flavor. 

Now, about the service: horrendous.  Be prepared to order as soon as you sit down, because the food takes forever to arrive. I like to think it is because the food is being freshly prepared, but at this joint lets not kid ourselves. The waiters are usually hanging out behind the counter and will not notice glasses that are empty or you trying to get their attention. My friend had to practically wave her card and do a handstand to get the waiters to come over. 

Every time I have been here it has been a hit or miss with some of the times being quite enjoyable. For that reason I will give it an average of 3 stars. If you still want to give this place a try I suggest doing takeout."}
{"text":"wow what a cute random little shop!

Just recently started exploring this area but it's such a pleasant surprise to have found this place.

delicious food. huge portions. we had to pack a lot of leftovers to go (yay lunch for tomorrow!)
We got fish pakora, manurian chicken, crispy ginger beef, and tofu with mixed veggie. All delicious. 

definitely will visit again!"}
{"text":"Wasn't too sure because of all the bad reviews online. Went here for a last minute lunch with a friend. I called ahead to try and place a sit in order before I got there cause we were both meeting there and I only had an hour. The server wasn't rude in his response but told me they don't do that. 

I showed up 9 minutes later and when he brought my menus I just gave him my order, so rudeness just quick and efficient. Exactly 5 mins later my food came out steamy hot lol except my friend was running late so I had to wait a good 5 minutes anyways... I definitely snuck a few pieces in my mouth. 

Ordered the lunch specials (chili chicken and manchurian beef) both were saucy, flavorful and spicy!  The chicken still had crunch after 5 mins and the beef was really tender. All this plus spring rolls rice and a bottle of water for 5.95 each.. amazing deal!

I need to try their hot and sour soup though!

I'd definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"Cheaply priced. Menu has quite a few options. Had the lunch special and regular dinner as well. Food is ok, portions are decent. Restaurant isn't the cleanest and has an old interior feel to it. Service is pretty fast. Staff is nice and quite responsive. Would go back for convenience. Not the best spot to take visitors and guests. Parking lot is always a mess, not enough space to park due to Popeyes and Tims being in the same lot."}
{"text":"Manchurian fish 10/10 (perfect!) 
Curry chicken 9/10 (tasty!)
Crispy Ginger Beef 9/10 (amazing sauce and it's pretty crispy) 
Spicy Salt Shrimp 10/10 (so good! Not too salty, just perfect)

Good portions for an even better price. 
This place is really good!
I was recommended by a friend and I'm not disappointed at all.

Also, I have no idea why people are complaining about the service, they were quick (very quick) and friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing little place. No wait when I went but very huge portions with reasonable prices. Ordered the fried rice, chili chicken and chicken Pokora. All together came up to 35 including tip. Went to this place 2 times after. Pretty quick in service if the place isn't busy."}
{"text":"Huge portions for what you pay. Food is pretty average but definitely hits the spot when you need something quick. I've had a few different options so far but nothing outstanding. It's close to my office so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried hakka manchurian chowmein did not like it too much ginger garlic. Giving 3 star as im assuming other items are better"}
{"text":"We had a team lunch from work yesterday at Hakka No. 1 location.  They have multiple locations.  I only tried the location number 1.  We ordered multiple dishes to share among us.

What I like the most is their Singapore Noodle, it taste just right, it is not too much curry but you can taste the curry, I like how they stir fry the noodle, it is not overcooked compare to other places I go to.  

I also like their Chicken Fried Rice and Crispy chicken lunch special. They give you a decent portion for the chicken and rice.  It is more than enough for me.  

It get really busy around lunch time.  the price is decent.

The service here is really sucks!  The lady customer service is horrible.  You asked her a question she answered you very rudely.

Food is ok for the price and it taste is 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"Service is OK. 

Food is delicious. Very flavorful. Portion is big. Family style dining. Affordable. Will likely end up with leftovers. 

Definitely recommend this place if you want flavorful, delicious and affordable food :-)

They have weekdays lunch specials :-)"}
{"text":"This place serves a great meal, food is amazing and staff is super friendly. A little pricey but the freshness of the food totally makes up for it. I can totally recommend this place if your into Chinese food.

2 thumbs up!!!

{"text":"Food is really good, portion size is perfec for a large group. Love their homemade spicy chilli sauce.... ahh soo good!!"}
{"text":"Should've checked the review on Yelp before I went here. Then again a friend took me & he doesn't check reviews. 

I judge a hakka/Indian Chinese restaurant on their chili chicken. I'd rate it a 2 out of 10 here.

The ONLY good thing are the portion sizes.

I honestly don't know how restaurants who serve horrible food can be in business!! 

I will never go here again. If I ever find myself at Keele & Lawrence so hungry I could eat anything, I still wouldn't go here."}
{"text":"Food seems good, not extremely fresh but decent when you're hungry. Food takes a LONG time for prep dining in or taking outPREPARE TO WAIT. They tell you 30 mins for take out but plan for an hour, so don't pay when you get there so if they take too long you can still cancel your order."}
{"text":"I'm a bit new to hakka but there are a lot of similarities to Chinese cuisine. I see all these bad reviews but I didn't experience any of that during my visit. 

The service was actually quite good. We had two different servers who tended to us. Our waters were refilled and they did the usual check up without being too invasive. 

There is an extensive menu and we only ordered two out of the plethora of choices. The chicken pakora had a nice kick to it and it was a generous large portion of meat. I had one piece which was a bit fatty but it wasn't too big of a deal. The beef rice noodles were delicious. Just the right flavour and on par to what I get in other Chinese restaurants, maybe even a little better! 

I have yet to try other dishes on the menu and I'm not sure if I would just because I liked these two dishes so much. Will update this review if I ever do!"}
{"text":"I find their food to be very dry. It tastes fine buy their meat dsent seem appealing at all. They have a vast amount of meals though."}
{"text":"This low key establishment is my favorite place for Hakka chicken pakoras. I have tried many but this is literally my favorite place in the GTA for good Hakka food. I can't get enough of their spicy chicken and tiger shrimp!! It's a must when I visit home"}
{"text":"Good food, HORRIBLE service.  I've been here countless times with my family, and have even thrown family parties here just because the food is good and the price is fair.  Service on the other hand, is absolutely ridiculous.  No smiles or greetings, and their favourite line in the world is probably \"$1 extra for more sauce\".  They should definitely consider hiring actual and polite waiters who know what they're doing.  Don't bother tipping either, they already charge it on their bill.  We only come here because its close to where I live, but if you want equally good Hakka food and proper service, I suggest China Cottage--though its a lot farther."}
{"text":"The food is good and the staff is very friendly. I went to go pick up a very large take out order and they were running a couple minutes behind. The staff asked me to take a seat and were very kind when they asked me to wait a few minutes and they even apologized for the wait and brought me out a glass of water. If you're vegetarian I highly recommend the cauliflower Manchurian which is a good twist on the classic and overly done manchurian. The only dish I didn't like that we ordered were the steamed dumplings which are pretty much broken when I opened the container."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. Great variety of items, service is prompt and courteous. Great value for every item and the portions are very large. There's a good selection of vegetarian items and overall just a odd place to get a good meal."}
{"text":"I've only been to this Hakka no.1 location but it is my go-to hakka place! They have the BEST Bombay chicken hands down the rest of the menu items are on point and always consistent. They give options to make dishes 'extra spicy' for 25 cents more(which I always opt for) and their supper spicy hot sauce and pickled chili peppers give me spice-gasms every time."}
