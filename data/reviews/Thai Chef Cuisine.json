{"text":"I was in the area early for an event, and wanted a snack, so I checked out this place. The food was delicious, which is why I am giving this place any stars. Unfortunately, the service wasn't so great. My partner and I walked in, and after waiting five minutes for someone to acknowledge us, we walked over to the bar to look at the menus. Finally, a server came out and took our order. We figured this was one of the places where you need to go up to the counter to be served, e.g. not a sit down place, so we placed our order and sat down. After about half an hour, our food finally came out--which included a bowl of soup and spring rolls, so not sure why it took so long--but it was packed to go. The server put the packed food on our table, and my partner and I looked at each other dumbfounded. My partner called the server back and told her we were eating there, not taking the food to go. The server was already not the nicest person I've come across, but this really set her off for some reason. I avoided eye contact with her for the remainder of our meal, which wasn't hard because she didn't come back to ask us if we were ok, if the food was ok, or if we needed/wanted anything else. I'm not eating here again."}
{"text":"Firstly, I'd like to start off by saying that I would love to give them one more star - but let me digress. 

I really really enjoy the food from this restaurant. It is always beautifully presented, both take out and eat in. Their lunch specials are a good size and price, and their dinner portions are really generous. 

My Thai standard is Basil Spicy Noodle, and theirs doesn't disappoint. Full of crispy red and yellow peppers and just enough heat to get you going. However, my favourite menu item is their Thai Cold Roll which is julienned mango, grilled chicken, vermicelli, coriander and mint rolled up into YUM. A bit pricey at $7.95, but they're almost a meal in themselves. 

The few times I've eaten in, the service has been helpful and quick. So great food, good service.... but.... last time I was there (July 2010) there were cockroaches crawling on the wall behind my dinner companion. I'm not going to lie, I continued to ate and didn't say anything, because really - it's pretty close to Parkdale."}
{"text":"Some of the nicest and attentive staff-- there is no such thing as over tipping. The Thai coconut soup is fantastic and the peanut sauce is my favourite."}
{"text":"We went on a weeknight and the place was insanely understaffed. It was like walking into a Tim Horton's when all the staff is catering to the cars in the drive-through. This place does well with their take out, but in the restaurant there was one poor soul serving everyone. We had a party on nine and there was a 10-minute gap between the first entree and the last one. The food was good though."}
{"text":"I have dined in and ordered take-out several times over the past two years, and always enjoyed excellent meals.

After a near eight-month hiatus, a friend and I ordered take-out, and were disappointed with the quality of the food. 

Thai cold rolls were the best part of the meal, with fresh, crunchy veggie filling, even if the rice wrap was a bit on the tough and rubbery side.

We also ordered pad thai, coconut (\"Tom Kar\") soup, panang curry, and cashew nuts shrimp. All four dishes delivered on flavour, but were incredibly over-salted, judging from the amount of water we both consumed afterward. I suspect the restaurant has started using MSGs, because I don't remember ever being so thirsty after eating there.

Thai Chef Cuisine started out strong and was a nice addition to the neighbourhood. It's unfortunate the food quality has gone down-hill."}
{"text":"My dinner here was just ok. My green curry was more sweet than spicy -- lots of chicken, but few vegetables. I would not order it again. The price seemed reasonable until I realized that rice is not included and, instead, costs an additional $2-3. I guess it would be good deal for low-carbers? 

The lukewarm water in my glass and stuffy air in the restaurant were also unappealing. My dining companion enjoyed his veggie curry pad thai though, so dinner wasn't totally a bust."}
{"text":"Overall, the food tasted very good. I suspect it was high in salt though. We had the bbq pork (excellent) spicy noodles (very good) and the pineapple curry (very good / excellent). The one thing I will say, the vegetables were very fresh. Small on portion size for the price. If the portion size was larger I think the reviews would be stronger across the board."}
{"text":"I miss Green Mango...really really really miss the place.  

This is not Green Mango, not even close...but when I get a hankering for Thai soup Thai Chef Cuisine is my neighbourhood joint that I turn to in my hour of need.

After a couple of trips trying a few items from the menu (nothing really sticking out as memorable or worth ordering again)  I now mostly just stick to ordering take out soup.  We get the Tom Yum soup and the Lemongrass soup and a side of noodles.  I find alone the two flavours seem to be missing something that no amount of fish sauce, lime squeezing, and cilantro additions will fix, but mix them together (along with the noodles) and you get a wonderful combo. 

So there you go.  If there are 2 of you and you want a really tasty Thai soup for dinner call them up and place an order for takeout and mix it up in the privacy of your own home.  ha.

For what it's worth, the food here is better than the Thai place 2 doors down (my friendly Thai), but not even close to as tasty as the stuff you used to get at the mangs."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Thai food place in our neighbourhood. The chicken curry pad thai is amazingly delicious - we crave it every time we walk by. They are friendly, they are always super fast - watching our glasses if we're drinking water. And it's really affordable - dishes are between $8 - $12.  I've never had a disappointing visit and have been many times!"}
{"text":"Very yummy Thai food. I think that the owners are actually Thai and you can taste the authenticity in the food. It tastes much better than food at \"The Friendly Thai\" down the street. My favorites are the pineapple salad, the spicy beef salad, the green and red curry, pad Thai, and the garlic shrimp were also very fresh and tasty. My boyfriend likes the golden curry. I also enjoyed the spicy green beans that were served at the Polish street festival. I wish they put that on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai spot.  I have been eating lunch here at least once a week for the past few years.  Twenty years ago when I first started working on Roncesvalles it was a bar called Andy Capp's.  Then it became just Andys which was a great spot to grab a simple lunch and watch Days of our Lives on the TV.  Eventually, it became Thai Chef Cuisine.  The decor has not changed in all that time and a part of me wishes they would renovate it into something a bit more sleek and modern.  But do not let the dated and drab bar decor deter you from trying their food.  I really have enjoyed most of their menu offerings over the years and their Daily lunch special costs between $7.95 to the most expensive being $10.95.  Lunch time is pretty quiet, so the service is fast and friendly.  Though I found Fridays can get quite busy and with only one server be prepared to wait for your food awhile longer than usual.  I don't really have a favorite.  Depends on my mood and what I am craving when I walk in.  I do however ask for not too spicy on some of their more authentically Thai dishes and they are more than happy to comply with the request.  So if you are looking for just good Thai food without all the bells and whistles, come on down."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever eaten here was at least fine and usually very good. BUT, what truly stands out about Thai Chef are the transparent rolls. Best I've had hands down.
The service is friendly but sometimes insufficiently staffed for busy periods, no biggie unless you're one of those silly entitled twats who expects to be coddled while scowling. 
About 5-10 years back, this location used to be a dingy bar. It still is a bit dark if you sit away from the front. On the flip side, its a good date spot, and the bathrooms are clean!"}
{"text":"Brilliant food at reasonable prices. I would recommend this place to anyone.
Food was hot, plenty of it and very tasty."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan.  Have ordered here a few times over the ages and always been underwhelmed.  Specifically today had pad Thai for takeout at lunch $14 bucks for starters which was bland with clearly reheated bits of chicken as they had little burn (grill) marks on them.  Left with a less than desirable aftertaste.  I won't even mention the surly service I've gotten more than once from the little owner."}
{"text":"Excelent service and food! Prices ok. Will definitely repeat soon!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem. 
Food is super delicious and vast improvement in service since the new owners took over. The food is worth the wait. It's busy for a reason so just budget for it. 
Cold rolls, Pad Thai, tamarind beef and shrimp rolls are my favourite. The curry's are delicious too!"}
{"text":"I had the pineapple salad which was good, and unique. I also had the salad roll which had a nice presentation. Both were a bit on the salty side for my taste. The ginger tea is really good value, and went well with my meal. The fried spring rolls was okay, it was filled with cabbage and carrot. My boyfriend had the lemongrass chicken which was probably the best value out of all of them. The salad and the salad roll were quite expensive for the portion size."}
{"text":"I just picked up some lunch takeout from here.  I ordered the pad thai and sticky rice with peanut sauce.

The lunch version comes with soup or salad, I opted for the soup. It's a lemongrass vegetarian soup, and it's interesting. Small pieces of baby corn, carrots, cabbage and tofu. I don't mind it, but I think it has a wee too much fish sauce in it.

The sticky rice with peanut sauce? Whoa. I could eat that all day.  The rice is mildly flavored with coconut and it's the perfect little amount of rice that you can roll up into balls and dip in the awesome peanut sauce. I am so pissed b/c I just knocked it off the counter and all over the rug and my jeans. I may consider going back to get more so I can finish the rice. It's that good. 

The pad thai is a great portion. It comes with a spring roll as well. For 8.95 it's not breaking the bank and it is hitting the spot. I am not certain if it's supposed to have shrimp in it, but there's chicken and tofu which is grilled nicely. It's not out of this world but I'd order it again when I'm looking for pad thai in a pinch."}
{"text":"If you're ever in High Park and in the mood for Thai food, you should stop by and check out Thai Chef Cuisine. Free neighborhood parking, one hour limit until 6pm. Such a quaint restaurant with a lovely little fountain in the corner, Thai statues and art and a lovely wait staff.

Sat down and ordered Pad Thai Shrimp, Pad See Ew Beef and 2 Thai iced teas. The Thai teas arrived first and they were super sweet. I asked for a glass of ice so I poured half of it over the ice and it was much better, hey, I get double the Thai tea! Both dishes were sweet and the noodles were overcooked. The beef was tenderized like in Chinese restaurants, which I don't care for because it changes the texture of the beef. The veggies were crisp and fresh tasting. 

Overall the food was fast food quality but I really enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant (see pics). I will be back to try their curry dishes to see if I can give them another star. The wait staff is super friendly, knowledgeable of their menu and attentive."}
{"text":"Tasty and reasonably priced Khao Soi! Mostly white meat, with crispy noodles on top  I'll definitely be coming back for takeout etc. 

Service was great and window seats were lovely for ambiance."}
{"text":"Best coconut veggie soup perfect for a cold night. Love the cashew shrimp. Good service good spot."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Service was good. 

I ordered their Pad Thai  lunch special and asked for shrimp to be added and then opted out when I was told they would charge an additional $3 for two pieces of shrimp. 

Besides that I do love their food. It's fresh and tastes great."}
{"text":"Food was good, had Pad Thai but portion was too small like a snack for an Asian restaurant. Server was nice and helpful. Went here for lunch last Friday. Would not come back due to such small portions. I was still hungry and had to snack when I came back to work.;"}
{"text":"Decent food however very small portions and an hour and twenty minutes for delivery (after I was told 45 mins max and I live about 2 mins drive from the place).

Had to re-heat all the food when it got here, delivery guy showed up with no car.  I think they truly forgot about us, cooked up some food asap, didn't care about whether the portions made sense and made the guy walk over here in minus 15 weather.  When he got here he said \"sorry for late\".  No offer of a discount.

Pathetic.

I *may* think about going back to eat-in as the food is good but they've lost us as delivery customers for sure.  Can't believe I may have to go back to the Friendly Thai for delivery... they're not nearly as good food wise but at least they deliver on time."}
{"text":"It is hard for me to think clearly about the food here because we were ravenous by the time it arrived. It took forever. The service was pretty mediocre. The waiter told us that we were not getting enough food for the table, but he was definitely wrong about that. Good thing too because no way would we have ordered anything else without another hour to spare.

It was our first visit there and the food was fine, but not great. Our dining companions assured us that both the food and service were superior on previous visits. 

Nothing special and I am unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best Thai food in the BloorWest/Roncy area. And my boyfriend's Thai obsession has led to me trying more than a few!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a few steps above your average TO Thai place.

Got the lunch special here.. and take out. We were very happy with both (being very particular Thai food customers) 

We got only red and green curries and both were very flavorful. My only complaint would be little bit lacking in the veggie variation in the curries (both had chicken, bamboo shoots,  Thai bail, and a few green peas). With some eggplant, mushrooms, or more authentic vegetables, the curry would be wonderful!  Service was also above par, the waitress and delivery man were very kind, timely, and professional."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Everything was well spiced. The ginger chicken was awesome. Pad thai tasted like pad thai, not cappy ketchup. Delivery was on time and 6 dishes came to $65. Will definitely order again"}
{"text":"2.5

Nice staff.

Food is really just OK and pricey for the very casual look of the place and the overall small portion sizes... chicken coconut soup is like a soup-in-a-can with few mushroom and chicken pieces thrown in it... it tastes OK but I missed the chunks of galanga, leaves of basil and cilantro. Lots of green and red pepper chunks in almost every meal but very few of the other ingredients.

Cold place in the winter (bring a sweater! and eat spicy!)."}
{"text":"As Thai places go, Thai Chef will successfully fill the hole for Thai but not necessarily impress you.  If you live in Ronco-town, delivery is a nice option because I've discovered not all delivery places will serve the area.  

The specialty curries we ordered in were pretty solid, and spicy asparagus with shrimp did not disappoint.  The sole time I ate in was on a very slow Tuesday night, so service was prompt and the Tom Yum soup was good.  

Again, it's not going to knock your socks off but it's good Thai in an area where there aren't a lot of Asian options."}
{"text":"I like to come here for the lunch specials. I usually get the mixed vegtables. For 10.95, you can get a spring roll, a salad, and a meal. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm, all the things.  I haven't had a meal I don't like here, and we order from Thai Chef a lot.  This is the BEST Thai place in the neighbourhood.  They send free spring rolls if you order over a certain amount (as long as you mention it in the comments, if you order online).  The beef skewers and just mouth watering, and we end up landing on this place when we want a failproof meal that is always impressive."}
{"text":"Ugh. I don't even know where to start. We came here last year and the panaeng curry was decent. Nothing to write home about but it certainly scratched the itch.

This year, this year the food is god awful. We got two curries(for variety) and a cashew nut chicken. Although we got a red curry and a panaeng, which are very different curries, what we got was the same, overly peanut-y, watery, mockery of of what should be two DIFFERENT amazing curries. They did not in any way, shape, or form resemble a curry. 

The cashew chicken was even worse. So much sauce! It's not a soup! No, stop. It was so greasy, the chicken wasn't fried like it should be,there was broccoli which was weird but close to zero cashews. 

You're better off getting delivery from sukhothai because I guarantee it will be more authentic and won't cost an arm and a leg."}
