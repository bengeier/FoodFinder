{"text":"An excellent and inexpensive local place.  The vegetarian fajitas are sooo good, better than Chili's chicken fajitas by a long shot.  Beans are good, rices is good, service is fast and food arrives warm.  Kids eat free on Sunday.  Very busy at lunch but not as busy for dinner, so prefer them over the chains."}
{"text":"Killer food. Fast service. Fajitas are fantastic and house margaritas reasonably priced, delicious, and plenty of tequila. 

I live right across the street and most certainly will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in fiesta maya thought of trying Mexican food. It was very quite on Sunday 7:30pm when I went and only a couple of tables are filled. It's a clean restaurant. The chips was not good as I expected(may be because I recently came from Texas). Reading the reviews I thought of trying  hot sauce but I didn't like it much. The server was punctual and our food was served in time. My Fajita was served hot and enough for me to take home and eat the next day. :) . The taste of food was ok and that's why 3 star but we enjoyed the nice and calm place."}
{"text":"Unassuming Mexican food.  Has all the usual dishes and some specials.  The food is decent, inexpensive and the staff is friendly.  If you need your fix, it's as good a find as anything else.  It's a good lunch option, as they have lunch specials and service is generally pretty fast."}
{"text":"Its awesome.
I am not a mexican. And i never ate mexican food. I went with my friend and i try it first time. I swear i really like it. And i wish i will go daily . 
  :)"}
{"text":"Super big portion, endless tortilla chips with awesome salsa, really great price (for lunch). Just don't count the calories when you eat here..."}
{"text":"Years ago I rated this place fairly well.  Back then I enjoyed it a lot better.   Today I was so disappointed and frustrated.   Ordered the Fajitas Diablas and then had to wait 15 minutes before I received the tortillas.  I tried to eat without tortillas but the meat was so salty I really needed the tortillas.  By the time they arrived everything was cold.  Only got 2 tortillas too which isn't enough.  I would expect 3 like most other restaurants.  Bad service, good has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Had the best Meican there last night!!  2 enchiladas, 1 taco, and rice for $7.00!!  and the enchiladas were sooooo full with chicken it was hard to cut it with a fork!!  So at least you know they don't skimp on quantity.  Would recommend anyone to go here and try it out, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"Definitely a good place to have dinner and more than a few drinks. They have specials during the week and their margaritas are nothing extrordinary but they sure do the trick!"}
{"text":"Great authentic food! Excellent service & very clean! You won't regret stopping here to eat."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Charlotte. Hands down. The owners and wait staff are beyond nice and they make it a fun experience. We go at least every other week!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in this area! Wife and I got the el combo portion size was huge very nice quality though. The salsa especially the hot salsa is delicious. If you're in the mood for Mexican then go check it out you'll not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Took the mother-in-law out for a little thank-you dinner here.  This was our first time here.

The menu was very extensive.  There's pretty much something for every taste if you enjoy Mexican food.  The service was excellent.  The obligatory chips and salsa were warm and fresh.  We all got combination entrees and enjoyed them very much.  Everything was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  The prices were very reasonable.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this little gem and will be going there again."}
{"text":"This restaraunt is a great little hidden treasure.  Great service and great food.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican. But the service leaves much to be desired like waiting for the waiter to finally return when they place you at a booth out of line of sight. Proprietor is kinda fake acting and insincere. The quality of the food which is good does not make up for the shoddy service.  The patrons there are usually loud and obnoxious or undisciplined children."}
{"text":"I love the University City area since this is where we chose to move about 11 years ago.  I have been eating at Fiesta Maya for so long I can't even remember when it opened and I have outlasted all but one of the servers and a manager as there has been a  change in manager in the last year from the original when it opened.  When we moved here, I asked about a Mexican Restaurant and was disappointed by all that I was recommended- Monterrey, Azteca, Zapatas, and another that I don't even think is open anymore. I had given up on finding a Mexican restaurant that I would like up here and then  Fiesta Maya opened.   I was so happy!!!

The enchiladas suiza are very good- for the review criticizing the sauce, how do you think they make a Monterey Jack cheese sauce?  They also have sour cream on top along with the guacamole salad and rice.  The lunch specials are your standard fare: Speedy Gonzales, burrito, taco rice, etc. but are at a very good price.    The enchilada verdes is made with a good tomatillo sauce ( I am picky about my green sauce) and the fajitas are good as well, though they don't have the most taste with the meat.   Refried beans are solid, tacos have plenty of yummy Monty Jack on top and the brown sauce on the regular enchiladas is good, too.  The new manager brought in a new cook, I think, because some of the items are made a little better than before and maybe changed the food service company.  I have been in when the chips are stale, but then they aren't made fresh on site, either, and the salsa is pretty good.

We are regulars, so they make a comment about missing  us when several weeks go by and we haven't been in.  I would think that description right there would suffice to say all you need to know about the quality of  this restaurant, but then what you are looking for may be different than myself.  They are friendly and I usually have the same two waiters.  For the price, you can certainly afford to give it a try. I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices and the servers are the most friendly I've found. I come in here all the time with my wife and the server knows my order by heart. It gets really crowded Fridays and I suggest making a reservation. They give away margaritas on Fridays also I believe."}
{"text":"Fast service, good food, not great food but good. Wife says ground beef is full of grissle, chicken verde enchaladda(sp?) Were very good, premium margarita was on special on saturday for $9, yes thats right nine dollars! I was afraid to ask what the regular price was. There are better places close by."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious, only outdone by the service! I love going to eat when my server has a smile and is a friendly person.  My boyfriend and I had a great time and will definitely be back next time we visit Charlotte"}
{"text":"I always order delivery. The food is EXPENSIVE. The delivery charge is EXPENSIVE. a few times it was cold. A few times the food was hot. The seniors who deliver it are very sweet. One thing I can't understand is why charge $5.00 delivery charge and then food for one is like $20.00 and you still have to tip the delivery person?? More like BS to me. I order when I don't feel like leaving the house and am working hard. But they need to come down on the prices. The food isn't even seasoned well. I order the same thing every single time. Stop being so expensi"}
{"text":"Food is just average, I've been going there for years since I live close but find myself not going as often now since a change of ownership about a year ago has made some undesirable changes including higher prices, charging extra for more tortillas with fajitas & quality of food just being average for a Mexican restaurant.  I've found many better places in Charlotte for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great food and fast... Definitely not like chain Mexican food 
A buck for sour cream is my only complaint"}
{"text":"This is a small hidden jem that serves good Mexican food at reasonable prices. The service is friendly and accommodating. We love their Chiles Poblanos."}
{"text":"This has quickly become one of my favorite places for some good and inexpensive Mexican food. The location is easy to get into and out of which is a definite plus for take-out. I have tried probably over half of the menu and have never been dissapointed. My personal favorite is the fish tacos which come with a delicious chipotle sauce. I would definitely recommend this place for dinner and margaritas with some good friends. The staff is very friendly and helpful and delicious free chips and salsa are always a plus. One tip: don't order the queso, its a waste of money."}
{"text":"This place is small kid-friendly.  The food is average but the staff is nice."}
{"text":"I am from Texas, I did not go to \"Fiesta Maya\" with high expectations, but I believe that 3 days of food poisoning surpasses anything remotely redeemable about this restaurant.  Your better off making it at home or waiting until you can get to Texas for the real stuff."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place! My boyfriend and I order take out from here all the time. The portion size is incredible and the service is fast."}
{"text":"I really like this place as a quick lunch or cheap dinner out.  The portions are generous, the food is tasty (but not really authentic, as a lot of people have pointed out,) and the waitstaff does a good job.  

They have pretty stiff margaritas, judging from the few that I've had, so it's probably not a bad place to catch a buzz in, if you like margaritas!!"}
{"text":"Went based upon reviews and loved this place!  Gotta try the guacomole made at the table!  Fantastic!  Shrimp burrito was stuffed full!  Chicken enchiladas filled with chicken!  Great find!"}
{"text":"Worst food I've EVER encountered in a restaurant in my entire life! The chips were stale and smelled like old oil! I immediately had a stomach ache and had to run to a drugstore for tums! We brought it to the attention of the waiter- they brought out more chips but same problem- they were frying the chips in very old oil! They reeked! All entrees were stale and not fresh. Plates were sooo unappetizing looking- not even plated nicely or with any garnish. My daughter and I had stomach aches for 3 days after. I would NEVER eat here again!"}
{"text":"We visited this place a couple of times and it was nothing to write home about. On our last trip there our waiter had suggested that we try their signature margarita witch allegedly contained 6 shots of liquor. Both of us being very light drinkers could barley taste any liquor in it what so ever, for a drink that cost 17$. We decided to ask our waiter to consult with the bartender about the issue. The bartender came to our table and copped and attitude with us saying \"I know what's in it, I made it!\" Very arrogantly.
Of course they offered no compensation or explanation for the virgin drink. These people seem to be very untrustworthy so that was our last trip. Try Azteca, it's less than 2 miles away and never disappoints. Just my two cents."}
{"text":"Best kept secret! Food is always great. Price are very reasonable. My family eats here a lot."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Great food, great service, great prices, and great atmosphere. We have been coming here since before the grand  opening!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the food is really good, that's not the problem.  But the service, from Elvin especially, is really bad!

The first bad experience with Elvin was when I ordered some food to go.  About thirty seconds after ordering the food, I said, \"oh, and please, no onions.\"  Elvin then said that they had already made the meal, that it was pre-made, and I would have to buy the meal again to get it with no onions.  If it was pre-made, they would have had to make it new for no onions anyway.  I asked Elvin if that meal was worth losing my business, and he said, \"I don't care.\"

I didn't return for over a year.  I was a bi-weekly customer before.  A year later when I went back, there was Elvin.  My friend ordered a #4, the have two #4s on the menu (which is dumb) and they brought out the wrong one.  Elvin fought with the customer and blamed him for ordering the wrong one.  What kind of customer service is that?  The mole sauce and the verde sauce is awesome though."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever at the hands of the owner. Horrible attitude. Increased the price for ceviche and when I questioned it, he became agitated. Even my normal server seemed puzzled by the owner's behavior.  Needless to say, I'm on my way to another restaurant where the prices don't fluctuate randomly."}
{"text":"They had me at the $4.99 margaritas!!! Do you really need me to write more??? 

Ok...Ok....I will...these margaritas were awesome! Not watered down, or full of sour mix but actually had a good amount of the good stuff...just like I like them!!! And for that price how can you say no???

The chips were hot and the salsa had a little bit of kick, chucks of tomatoes and seasoning and it tasted really fresh. Not the best salsa I've ever had at a Mexican joint...but it was pretty good....they bring it out in a small container and everyone gets their own bowl to enjoy!

I decided to try the Shrimp Fajitas and they came out sizzling!!! Can you say YUM!!! The seasoning on the shrimp was delicious...I could have taken more sour cream and guacamole, but the rice and beans were great! 

With these reasonable prices, good food and strong drinks...its not doubt I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite local spots.  Great service and friendly staff.  Best part is the free chips and salsa.  Highly recommended and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with a few co workers not expecting a whole lot out of the ordinary. I was pleasantly surprised by the service. The food was well proportioned and good. There was no shortage of chips or salsa. My sweet tea was always refilled before I even noticed. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"It's not totally bad nor totally great--just okay.  Our first visit here was pretty good, so we decided to come back. Even after horrible service and entree mix-up on Cinco de Mayo, we came yet again on Monday night.  I asked the server if there were any drink specials and he began telling me about the margaritas. Had the peach and it  was just not very flavorable... waste of almost $7.   The server was decent.  Luckily we had a LivingSocial deal to help with the bill. We think we take an extended break from the \"Fiesta\"  ;)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food for takeout. I never at in house that's why I gave the 4. It comes well packed up and it is plentiful. I truly ordered to much and ate again the next day. My husband enjoyed his meal and he doesn't get any veggies. I had a tamale and it was enough for a meal. I also gad the combo with a little bit of everything. I have ordered there 3 times and will continue. Matter fact I reviewed myself hungry. Wink . Picking up the cell phone."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and so was Service. The restaurant was a little crowded and messy. Needed some house cleaning. Frozen Margaritas were amazingly good!!"}
{"text":"I don't live far from this Mexican spot, and I will say that this restaurant has been here for many years, at least 10 I believe and although I knew it was there, I've never been..........ride past it all the time..........never stopped.  When I eat Mexican, I have my favorite go to spots.  I say all that to say I made the mistake of coming here recently...........why.........I still do not know.  For years I had followed my gut instinct of staying away from this place and now I know why.  I ordered steak fajitas for take out and while I waited, I ordered a small margarita............since no one asked me what flavor, I had to walk over to the bar to make sure they made peach.  It was empty on this weekday so it didn't take long for the food to come out.  The peach margarita was more of a lime taste since he assumed that's what I wanted initially, he didn't start over just added peach flavoring.  Once I got home I realized I had chicken fajita's eventhough my receipt said 'steak', but no big deal same price.  The chicken tasted really weird, and had the worst after taste.........chips and salsa were mediocre.  Follow your gut and keep it moving, this place is not what you want."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the food and service left much to be desired. The drinks we ordered were wrong and our food was delivered prior to even getting the drinks. The server was inattentive and struggled to meet the most basic needs. Multiple orders were wrong or forgotten."}
{"text":"If you like basic, generic Tex Mex style food, then you will love this place. Looking for a more authentic experience? Then head on down to N Tryon ST. That being said it's not bad, service was great, food was inexpensive,  the meal arrived quickly. If you ask they have a spicier salsa that they can bring to you. Is it a hot salsa? No, don't think I've ever had anything that was actually hot in here, but it has great flavor. It's close to the house, so I will be back periodically."}
{"text":"I've been two times so far and will continue to come! First impression is that the inside had a lot of people for an off time (which is a good sign in my book). I was ridiculously hot in the place. I was really uncomfortable. The lunch menu has a lot of options and crazy good deals. I've been very happy with my Monterrey Steak Burrito both times. Second time we came we were seated by the bathroom where it smelled like hot sewer. Not happy about that but the food is so good that we will give them a chance to redeem themselves. I also really love their chips. They've been hot and fresh both times! That never happens at other places. We had great service too."}
{"text":"The initial thing that drew us to this restaurant was the price but upon viewing the menu a majority of the items were $10+, so that was a little disappointing. I had a burrito with rice and cheese on top. It wasn't quite as big as the waiter stated but it was a decent size. My husband had enchiladas with cheese sauce and rice on the side. He said the rice was good and he is very particular about his rice. The atmosphere was quite and quaint. Waitress wasn't knowledgeable of specials or what some dishes consisted of. Maybe she was new but other than that all staff were very cordial."}
{"text":"Everyone is very nice. Guacamole is yummy. My daughter had the Vegetarian Super Quesa and it was wonderful. I had the Molcajete and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"When our family first moved to Charlotte 6 years ago, the house we rented was within 2 minutes walking distance from Fiesta Maya.  Ever since, we've been returning to this little gem, even after moving a few miles away.  The food is really good and very suitable for the range of tastes that are in my family.  I especially like their dishes such as Pollo Nortena and Arroz con Pollo, and this enjoyment has spread to my kids.  The staff are always friendly and attentive and we love them."}
{"text":"The cheese dip the chorizo is a must"}
{"text":"I wanted to give five stars but I couldn't.  Lack of consistency and stingy up-charges are in the way.

The weekday lunch specials are always the same five items in the same sequence.  Tuesday is enchiladas verdes.  I ordered the special.  I substitute rice for all beans on the side.

They charge too much for extras.  Carry out costs and addition .30, that is 5% hike on the special.  I wanted extra verde sauce on the enchiladas but they wanted another $1.  That is over 16% price increase.  Most other places will give you some extra cheese, sour cream, or sauce for free so long as it already comes with the entree in some quantity.

I eat here every week and the quality differs greatly.  Two weeks ago the chicken enchiladas had huge chunks of unseasoned chicken, this week is was orange with seasoning but very stringy.

I wish it was a bit more consistent and that they didn't charge you for all the extras (carry out being one of those extras).  They have coupons but you have to buy two drinks so in the end it is basically a coupon for free drinks.  You will never save a dime on your entrees."}
{"text":"MY FAVE MEXICAN FOOD IN CHARLOTTE!!!

I'm a huge Mexican food lover, and I grew up eating the good ol' cheap stuff. You know tex mex, not baja style.  When I moved to Charlotte, I started looking for a place that offered GREAT food for a cheap price.

I find most of the Mexican restaurants in Charlotte to be average at best, nothing close to the rich, spicy, melt in your mouth flavors I'm used to.  When my husband and I walked into Fiesta Maya, we were immediately transported to Mexico by the decor. 

Let's face it, how many places around here really authentic in terms of Mexican? You rarely find a hand made tortilla anywhere in the Q.C., besides the occasional taco cart that accompanies a soccer match.  This place is the best food for your money around in my opinion .  

The restuarant is always clean and the service has always been excellent.  

This is a MUST try if you like Mexican food.  Order the combos. The chili rellanos are fantastic, and the burritos are pretty tasty too.  Salsa, cheese dip, and guac are standard here, and are much better than the runny stuff that Azteca serves you and calls salsa.  

The portions are large, and we always have leftovers.

I will say that I agree that the margaritas are sub- par.  If you're a foodie though- it's for you! And they have good deals on cervesa too.

Go try it! I think you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Love their food and great customer service . They have amazing enchiladas and soup . Also. Have an option to have it delivered is definitely a plus. One of my go to Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"I called in an order and asked for a chicken quesadilla. When I picked up my order, it was shredded chicken with queso sauce. The manager was very nasty and rude over the phone. I brought it back and he was equally as rude. I've visited this place a million and one times when I lived on this side of town and will never send an animal to eat here! He tried to cheat me from what I paid by a penny. They won't get another dime from me or anyone else I know."}
{"text":"I would give this place more stars but the service was not good. The food was great and the drinks were good. But the waitress was very inattentive and distracted by too much. I will try them again."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service & plenty of delicious entrees!! My husband and I stop in once or twice a week for their fabulous margaritas!! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"If you like authentic Mexican cuisine and not so much the Americanized  type then Fiesta Maya is for you. This is  arguably one of the best Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte Area. IMHO"}
{"text":"Carnitas were great -- roasted pork that was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. 
We also had a California Burrito -- yummy steak, guacamole, lettuce etc.
Really liked the fresh chips and fresh sause.
Great service too!"}
{"text":"The cheese dip is amazing . The nachos are out the world . And the bar is awesome on a lunch break. Excellent restaurant to eat at."}
{"text":"It was good. I wouldn't drive 4 miles off the interstate for it again. Service was good and the food good. I had I mind something more."}
{"text":"4 stars for food. 2 - 3 for service. We had delivery first and the food is amazing. Very authentic. Plentiful!  A lot of food for your buck. We went in one Sunday & the place is laid out nicely. Decent TVs so it might be good for sports. We had a great waiter in out booth. But the second time we sat at the bar.  The guacamole made bar-side was delicious. Unfortunately, at one point I thought I was going to have to go on the kitchen to see if anyone was still working the bar. Disappointed."}
{"text":"If I must say so myself, the margaritas are good, the fajitas were above average and the chips and salsa were decent.

Now I love Mexican places I can walk too and have a few margaritas and then walk home, but two medium house margaritas and chicken fajitas later my bill was 40 bucks. I would be better off get a cab and meeting friends closer to uncc or north lake where food is the same if not better and way better prices. Will try again in a few weeks, but I would advise going in with the knowledge it's not your typical neighborhood mexican priced place."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! I had the diabolo fajitas (chicken, shrimp, steak, chorizo) and my daughter had the beef enchilada with rice and beans. Everything was delicious. Service was good as well. Defiantly will be back."}
{"text":"For your typical, run of the mill Mexican restaurant I'd say this place is as good as any. The food is tasty, the service is friendly, and the margaritas are huge.

The thing that really stood out were the portions. My fiancé got some kind of enchilada dish that was enough to feed both of us. Unfortunately, we didn't know that when ordering so I ordered the shrimp fajitas and had more than enough food, myself. 

My only complaint is that the shrimp were still in the shell, but grilled. I don't know if that was intentional but it was annoying, especially considering they were piping hot so I had to wait for them to cool before I could peel them. 

I don't find myself in this area very often but I'm glad to know this place is there for when I do."}
{"text":"Not authentic.Chicken soup is good and it comes in a big bowl. Good American style Mexican food."}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience I've probably ever had in my life, and I've been to a ton of Mexican restaurants and restaurants in general, so that's saying something. Once we got inside and were seated, our waitress took our drink orders. I asked if I could her a skinny margarita, and she sort of pondered on it for a second, to which she replied \"yes we can make that\". So, fast forward 15 minutes later, when my friends had their fountain drinks but my margarita was nowhere in sight. I asked her about it when she returned to the table (10 minutes later), and she replied \"it's organic like you requested, so we have to make everything fresh\". Organic and skinny aren't the same thing, but I digress. 

My margarita FINALLY arrives after 25 minutes of ordering it, and upon first glance, it looks a bit watered down and had a huge orange in it. Okay, odd for a margarita but whatever. I tasted it and was blown away by the overwhelming taste of vodka. Yes, vodka. In a margarita. I've had many a margarita in my day and I know the difference in tequila and vodka. So, I went up to the bar and asked the bartender what was in it, because it even smelled of vodka, and he argued with me that it was most definitely tequila. Okay, fine. My drink was way too strong and disgusting to even drink, so I maybe finished 2 full sips. The waitress came back knowing i was unhappy with my drink and didn't offer to fix it, make another one, and even put it on my tab. I kindly requested she take it off considering it was undrinkable. 

On top of the entire margarita fiasco, the waitress took an average of 15 minutes to bring us anything we requested. Lettuce, salsa refills, sour cream. The easy stuff. Needless to say, customer service was far past poor and we will absolutely not be returning."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! We live right across the street, and out of all the places in this shopping center (Blu Note, Jason's Deli, etc), this is our go-to. They have the best margaritas in town and really great, authentic food! The queso sauce is absolutely out of this world. 
I know a few people have mentioned their service wasn't the best, but we've never had a problem in the 5+ times we've been here. Sometimes the waitresses have to go check on prices or what's in a dish, but they've never been anything less than warm and welcoming. 
We love you, Fiesta Maya! :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  It's great since it's tucked away in a corner, but you can tell that once people find this place, they keep coming back.  Not to the point where it's hard to find a table, but it seemed relatively busy for lunch and especially in this location.

Service was friendly and good.  Seemed a bit slow, but I always tend to want to everything to move faster to give me enough time to get back to the office.

Food was good!  If you are looking for more of a tex-mex place... this would not be your best bet.  This place tends to lean more towards authentic than the jazzed up americanized mexican that people may have gotten used to.  We ordered the Queso con Chorizo... which seemed a little liquidy and greasy, but it was ok.  Not terrible, but not great either.  I'm sure regular queso would have been great.

I'll definitely go back now that I've tried it.... with lots of lunch menu items and combinations, should be a good spot to keep on the list as far as satisfying the mexican food cravings I tend to get every day."}
{"text":"The food and service was out of this world!!! Atmosphere was relaxing and staff made you feel welcome. I had the Monterey Cheese Steak Burrito. WOW!!!! The re-fried beans were on point and the fried rice was fresh and fresh can get, it was so soft and tasty. There was so much steak in my Burrito there not a single bite that I had none in it. Please next time you want Mexican, go here!!! For a Tuesday night in the pouring down rain, it was busy and food was AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"My go to mexican spot for lunch.  Location, location, location.  This is your typical tex-mex, it has that franchise menu you see all over the place.

The place is clean, the staff are friendly, and they have a loyalty program.  I always come on tuesdays, I am one of those people who has my spot."}
{"text":"On our way back from the waste-of-time home show at the Metrolina Expo, we decided to stop for some Mexican food, and this was the first place that we saw.  Well, we didn't really see the place, but we did see the sign out front, and managed to find our way to the back of the strip mall that housed them.

Inside, the restaurant is decent, but not spectacular.  The staff is nice, but not speedy.

The day that we were there, at least, they offered a few specials, and the menu selection was pretty typical Mexican fare - average portions, average food, but nothing outstanding.  A short while after getting home, just about everyone spent an extra shift in the bathroom, though, so something managed to work some magic.

No food poisoning or anything - just some good, old-fashioned beans or grease or who-knows-what that didn't want to stay inside for long.

I don't even remember that there was anything unique about it, other than the short stay inside.  The chips and salsa weren't bad, but then they usually are, unless you're at Valentino's on Sharon Amity."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. As we were leaving, we handed the guy $60 cash, our meal was around $45, and he came back and said that we only gave him $40. He then left and came back with the $15. It was pretty clear that he was trying to rip us off. The music is a little loud but the service was quick. All in all, I have had better Mexican before."}
{"text":"Biggest let down yet. Ive eaten here with my family since they opened. Never have i had the service i received at lunch today for a to go order. Everything was wrong when i got home. I waited 25 min for my food and it was wrong. I will not come back for lunch during the week. Hopefully they can staff better for lunch the woman running things looked flustered and confused. My favorite mexican joint has let me down today"}
{"text":"The food tasted microwaved. The salsa tasted like it was poured from a jar. Nothing really authentic tasting there. Service was good though"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in town. Great food, awesome portions, amazing wait staff."}
{"text":"Food was pretty nondescript, but it was the arrogant and rude service that is the catalyst for this rating. My friend ordered a Manhattan Red Apple Martini, even providing  the breakdown of ingredients. The bartender did not get it right, as evidenced by the color of the drink. Since one of the three ingredients was equal part cranberry juice, the drink's color should have been red to reflect it's name. It was not. When  asked to correct, the bartender argued and insisted he was right. His manager simply shrugged, with no comment, after being told about the unsatisfactory response from the bartender. Needless to say, this soured our visit, which was the first. It's a shame this restaurant precluded any future business, including word of mouth, because the adage \"the customer is always right\" wasn't adhered. Oh well......adios."}
{"text":"First time here for dinner tonight. Nice little place off Harris Blvd. The shame is that i have lived 2 blocks away for 5 years and just now tried it. It was really good. Wish  I had tried it sooner. 

I had the Maya combo. It was giant. The waiter should have warned me. Not complaining really. As i said it was really good. But it was so huge i was almost embarrassed to have it sitting in front of me all by myself. I took a big box of leftovers home. A great value in the end."}
{"text":"The worst. I've tried to give them so many chances and it's wrong or cold each time. Also don't go on lunch if you have a timed lunch because although it's never busy it takes forever."}
{"text":"This is a nice little hole in the wall place. When I first walked in, I was seated immediately and I was pleased at how clean every table was. Our server approached us almost as soon as we were seated and asked for our drink order. The chips and salsa followed right after (talk about timing). 

We were given some time to look over the menu because there was a lot that they had to offer... A LOT. I finally decided to order something and we received our food maybe 10-15 minutes later. I would've taken a picture (my apologies) but the food looked so good and the taste was even better. 

I was hoping for more drink specials for a Friday night but they had a few specialty drinks on the menu. I will definitely try this place again on the infamous Taco Tuesday."}
