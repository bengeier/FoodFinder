{"text":"Tried this as it was the best option in the part of the airport we were stuck in.  Food tastes great and is a surprisingly good value.  I had to soak the grease off w/napkin, but always do this.  The salad was tasty and a good portion.  The combo is an awesome value!  They don't skimp and food is tasty.  Especially considering it's at the airport.    The biggest plus was the guy, Michael, who helped us.  His friendly demeanor and customer service was outstanding!  He knows his stuff and helped customers figure out what the best option and value was for them.  My table was near the register, so I noticed how each customer walked away seeming a little happier than they arrived.  Keep this guy around!  Wish all food service workers were as helpful and happy."}
{"text":"Could not find this place. Maps got me lost on the backside of the Phoenix airport..sucks I really wanted pizza."}
{"text":"Found myself starving waiting on a flight out and this was the closest option honestly.  Not that I was overly unimpressed but it was just alright.  Given the name, as you might imagine they have different style pizzas for sale but on this day I decided to go a healthier route and picked out a salad topped with some grilled chicken. The salad was fresh, cold and topped with a decent amount of chicken.  I'm not generally a huge fan of any airport restaurants but this one I probably would eat at again.  They are quick, the food is decent and fresh."}
{"text":"While waiting for our flight we sat down to get something to eat here. We ordered one of their sandwiches, some soup, and wings. the soup and sandwich were made to order, however, the wings or not to order. the help full server let us keep those wings and was going to bring us back another order. the problem is that both orders of wings we're not cooked. They were raw. the server was going to get the manager to have them come out and talk to us, but the manager never showed. I would rate the server 5 stars for doing her part to make things right but the manager doesn't even deserve one star. as a result of the managers inaction this place gets one star."}
{"text":"I was surprised, for airport pizza that this was fairly good. I got a slice of the Wall Street and the Brooklyn (I think). Both were meat pizzas, but the Wall Street had better flavors and more toppings. The crust was awesome, I think they brush it with a garlic butter. The sauce was average and a good ratio of cheese and sauce."}
{"text":"So, we get this place at work ALL THE TIME. The pizza is better than the other chain restaurants but not as good as some places around here. We obviously can't order sauce, or humble pie for an office of 200 but I would much rather splurge on my New Years resolution for that type of pizza rather than NYPD..."}
{"text":"Was nervous to try it since it was in the airport, but it actually really good pizza. Get the bruschetta !"}
{"text":"I ordered the Turkey Pesto Focaccia for myself and the Kids Pizza Bites for my daughter; I expected something decent for me and some small pizza snacks for my daughter. In return I got a cold turkey, lettuce, and tomato slices on a French roll and my daughter got an adult size slice of pepperoni pizza. I also noticed that they have my sandwich to a woman in line in front of me who declined the sandwich and then instead of disposing of the sandwich they turned around and gave it to me. They rushed us through ordering and then made us wait 15 minutes for our food so I had no time to complain."}
