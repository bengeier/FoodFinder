{"text":"I had never eaten lamb before, so I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered Yuva's lamb shank. But when the waiter brought it out, I was speechless. The shank was an enormous hunk of meat attached to a skyward pointing bone. The presentation immediately garnered oohs and aahs from my friends, who all scrambled for a bite (hands off, it's mine!!!).  As for the taste (which is what really matters, right?!) it was like nothing I could have imagined. There was an enormous medley of exotic spices blended in the sauce, and the meat was soooo tender- literally falling off the bone. I hadn't had lamb before, but I finally figured out what the appeal is: it has a rich earthy taste that fills you with every bite.   The food I ordered was quite spicy (just the way I like it), but my cup was always filled with water by the prompt waiter- did I mention that he was very cute? The atmosphere of the place is also very nice: they have a TV with lots of Indian pop music videos, and there's large pictures from around India all over the place. What I'm trying to say is that it feels like you're stepping out of Pittsburgh and into a little exotic alcove of delicious foodstuffs. The polished wooden floor was spotless and all the silverware was shiny! What more can I say? I'll definitely be going back next week."}
{"text":"I was skeptical from reading all the reviews but went there last night for a dinner using Groupon.  The food is fantastic.  I'm not sure if they've lowered the price but didn't see any main course that price at $16 as the reviews below said.  We got the Samosa appetizer 2 pcs. for $3.99 which I think it's reasonable price.  The main dishes we got is $12.95 and $13.95 which is comparable to another Indian place down at the other end of Craig Street.  The food is fresh and cooked with lots of spices (which mean they use lots of spices/ not mean too spicy hot).  I could taste the intense spice in all dishes, which I think that's what should be expecting for in Indian food.  Even the filling of Samosa have a taste of spices, whereas other places would only be mild tasting potato with no flavor.  The portion may seem a bit small but with one appetizer, two entrees that come with rice and one garlic naan, filled me and my husband up without the need to take anything home.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The chicken tikka masala is not as creamy or tasty as it used to be. But the naan is still very good."}
{"text":"Had not been there since ownership change and it was decent but not something I would go out of my way to go back to before.   This time under the new ownership, I called in a order for takeout, the lady on the phone was very friendly, took my order, asked a couple question to verify that that was what I meant, and it was.  My wife picked up the food, and it arrived as expected, nothing messed up on the order, got exactly what I ordered. Lamb Korma, Chicken Tikka, basket of garlic naan, raitha, archar which was different than I am used to by the way, but also excellent (this one was chili pepper instead of mango and lemon), papadoms and chutneys and rice of course.  I didnt try the sweet chutney, but my family liked it, I thought the mint chutney was very good. not runny, thick consistency and flavorful.  The food was very good. I thought the papadoms were fantastic, the korma was also very good. meat could have been a little more tender, but was not tough. Might have used a bit more spice to it, but the achar made up for that.  The Tikka was also very good as were the raitha and naan. I can't really complain. If I had a small nit to pick it would be that I would like a little more spice and perhaps the meat a little more tender. Next time I will order some vegetarian dishes to try. Maybe I will see if they have aloo gobi and some dal or palak paneer."}
{"text":"Lunch Special yah!!! Woke up hungover trying to find anywhere to find a filling tasty meal on a Sunday morning and was pleasantly surprised by this new find. I don't know what the complaints are about because the decor was fabulous, the food very clean and tasty, and the service was perfect. This could possibly be the new hangover tradition."}
{"text":"The owner lady is very unprofessional and her son is an ass. They need to get a course in hospitality and good etiquette. We went in a group of 6 and were charged for something that we didn't order. We asked the owner why is the food cold? She picks up a fork from my plate, to my utter surprise and takes a spoon-full of biryani on her hand and says that its the cold air that has made it cold but the biryani is hot on the inside. Would not recommend anybody to go there and have food. ALWAYS GO FOR A TAKE-OUT.  Am still so pissed at the treatment meted out to all my friends."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. Fails completely in regards to food as well as service. This was perhaps the worst service experience I have ever had. The owner was too rude and unprofessional. She needs to get management and hospitality courses and then run a restaurant. Terrible value for money and too small portion sizes.  It all started with warm beer. When asked the server told that their cooler was not working. If this was the case then they should have told that the same before. Then we ordered the appetizer \"Delhi ki papri chaat\" which according to the menu should have papri, potatoes, chickpeas and chutneys. But we were served with just papri and chutney (no potatoes, no chickpeas, plain papri and chutney). On asking the server told that he will call the owner to talk to. The owner never showed up until we were done eating the main course. On asking the server again to call the owner to talk to but she didn't even have the courtesy to show up. On our getting upset on receiving the check, the server was able to call the owner lady who instead of accepting the mistake or apologizing and replacing the dish, kept saying that they alter the menu for their american customers and were too busy to change the menu. On top of that, to my surprise, she blamed is for calling her thrice to enquire about the appetizer we were served as she was too busy that evening and kept on giving lame excuses. We ended up getting no replacement for the appetizer and ruining our dinner!!!  Would never even think of going there and would not recommend ever."}
{"text":"This was perhaps the worst service I have had in my whole entire life.  Our server was very rude.  Rude is an understatement.  He was outright insulting.  It started with the warm beer.  I politely let him know that the beer was warm and that we'd like a cold one the next time.  He said, \"It's not warm.  It's 37 degrees.\"  Then he walked away.  It was actually closer to 72 degrees, but we were in shock with the response.  The night continued this way.  The waiters were combative.  We were nickel and dimed for every single thing.  For example, they brought us four bowls of rice, and then took one away saying, \"You only get three.\"    Do not go here.  These people are very unprofessional, I can only hope the lack of professionalism doesn't extend into the kitchen."}
{"text":"Very good lamb biryani with a beautiful presentation. Clean, nice decor. Middling service."}
{"text":"Feeling hungry during the lunch time and decided to try this place out considering of the good things I heard from my colleagues. The restaurant feels very clean and fresh and modern. I ordered the Yuva lunch because the server recommend it and it just hit the spot. Creamy chicken tikka masala, fresh salad and warm soft naan. Worth coming back and trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"For the positives, let me start by saying the food here is great. Yuva is one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to. My girlfriend (who is Indian) has said the same thing. Everyone else that I've gone here with has had nothing but praise. I've been in Pittsburgh for a little under a year now, and I've gone to Yuva for lunch about once a week. It's consistently delicious.  The atmosphere is clean and pleasant, and I've had only good experiences. The staff is pleasant and attentive.  I do have some quibbles though (and they are minor): I've had my meal come out spicier than I had ordered (or not as spicy as I'd ordered). This rarely happens to me, but it has. Some of the other reviewers have said this place is a little pricey and I can see that. Yuva is a little more expensive than some of the other Indian restaurants in the neighborhood, but their meals are well worth the price. I should note that I haven't ordered many of their teas or deserts so I don't have much to say about them.  In short, Yuva is great."}
{"text":"Yuva is my favorite place for Indian food - it's at a convenient location for me, and they always have great service and food. One of my favorite experiences there was Valentine's Day, when I went with my boyfriend. They had a special Valentine's Day menu with different options for couples, and the package we got was naan, lamb chops, curry, and dessert for $50. At the very end they handed him the check and me a bouquet of roses, haha!  Aside from special holidays, I also go there often for lunch or dinner when I don't feel like cooking. Their lunch menu has very reasonable portion sizes. I would try the Yuva Lunch on your first time there, because it has a great sampling of their best curries and comes with naan, rice, and salad. I almost never am able to finish the entire meal. For dinner, I normally get the chicken tikka masala, which never disappoints. The only  thing that I ever had that I didn't like was the mint and cumin lassi. I expected the drink to be sweet, but it was really strange and bitter-tasting.  The ambience is quite nice and the owners often come up to greet me. They have this wonderful tv behind the counter which plays Indian music videos all the time, and it's hilarious as well as educational..."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but even the lunch special was a little pricy. The service was really bad. The restaurant was very poorly organized. They should have more waiters."}
{"text":"I don't know why it is so difficult for some Indian restaurants in America to understand that when a customer asks to make a dish spicy, he/she wants to  have overall spice level high not just red chilly or black pepper in excess ! I ordered one spicy mutter paneer and restaurant added amount of red chilly powder that I usually consume in a year !  Pro: Ambience is good, fast service, I guess they just need to work on their spice level."}
{"text":"I had the somosas, onion kulcha, and saag paneer.  All three were good.  The service was generally good.  I had two minor complaints.  The somosas came out at the same time as my entree, which negates the value of ordering an appetizer.  Second, they were out of white wine except for two selections, and the one I ordered didn't come chilled."}
{"text":"Same people, same food as its predecessor Star of India, only it's nearly twice as expensive--and there's no lunch buffet.  It looks almost as though they've given up on getting students in for lunch and want professors and administrators instead.  Will concede that the renovation has made it much more attractive, but pretty art doesn't taste very good."}
{"text":"I went to Yuva India for lunch and had a great experience.  The interior is bright and warm looking and nicer than a typical Oakland restaurant.  The staff was attentive and the service was quick.  I ordered the saag paneer lunch: side salad, naan, rice and entree all for $10, which I thought was a good value.  While I do like other Indian restaurants in the area, I thought the flavor at Yuva was superior.  You can actually taste the spices, the food wasn't swimming in oil and the naan had a crisp bottom (sometimes at other places you end up with a greasy, bland entree and soggy bread)."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but they are utterly incompetent at running a restaurant.  Pros: * Decent Indian food * Nice decor  Cons: * It's expensive compared to other Indian restaurants of similar quality within a 10 minute walk * I ordered a vegetarian dish and they brought me chicken.  When I said I don't eat chicken, they insisted the chicken was cheese, so I tasted it.  I'm a vegetarian, so I was pretty upset about eating chicken, and instead of apologizing they just tried to convince me it wasn't a big deal.  They eventually did give us our meal for free * I ordered mild food, and it was definitely spicy.  Again, they tried to convince me it was mild.   * The waitress new nothing and didn't really seem to care.  I asked her a couple of simple questions about the food and she just shrugged instead of trying to learn about them * They were just generally a mess in terms of service  If it wasn't for the fact that I (a vegetarian) ended up eating meat there, I would have given them 2 stars."}
{"text":"Food is somewhat better than what you can get from the buffet at India Garden, but it's far more expensive and the servings are small. I won't be back until Yuva lowers their prices or introduces a lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Based on others' reviews here, I got two appetizers (samosas and lamb kebabs) instead of a main course for dinner, and I think I left happier (in terms of value and satiation) because of it, based on what I saw of my dining companions' choices.   I did like what I had, too.  I ate once or twice at the former Star of India, and Yuva is much better in terms of decor, and possibly even food (I can't remember the old menu, maybe it is really the same and it could even be the same cook in the kitchen for all I know).  Props for the great service - the waitress was willing to split checks for a large party, and the food came out promptly and together, which was impressive.  However, we are lucky in Pittsburgh to have other Indian restaurants that are really very good -- like Udipi and the India Gardens.  Yuva isn't even in the same league, which is why I'm giving it only two stars."}
{"text":"Take Home Message: Terrible quality, Terrible value for money. If you really crave good Indian, try going to Tamarind, Prince of India, or All India (all places are less than 1-2 miles from Yuva India, much cheaper and authentic).  Long Rant Follows:  This place continuously disappoints me (and it is the opinion of my non-yelper Indian friends too). It serves the most pricey and \"fraud Indian\" cuisine I have ever had. Having spent more than 20 years in India, I can say this with authority. Here are some instances when I felt like walking out of this place 1. Masala Chai: The chai served here is without milk. Any Indian can tell you that this is just plain wrong. 2. Pav Bhaji: I was served pav bhaji with a Naan instead of an American sandwich-bread, as is the dish all over India. It is hard to imagine that in the USA it was tough to get this ingredient. 3. Tadka Daal: I get the most bland daal I have had in my life. Obviously, there is no tadka at all.  At all occassions I have informed the management only to get replies like \"We alter the menu to better serve American tastes\". Don't get me wrong, I agree that one can change spices/recipes etc. However, all the above instances are outrageous. To those who cannot relate - it is like being served Falafel with a burger bread, without any warning.  And of course, the price here doesn't justify there quality of service or dishes. This is the priciest Indian restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh. In my opinion, going to \"Taste of India\" in the CMU campus is a much better deal. Taste of India in the campus is much cheaper, authentic but serves a repetitive menu."}
{"text":"Being an Indian, finding good quality indian food is always a challenge.  I would highly recommend the food at Yuva because most of the indian restaurants serve greasy food, Yuva however is an exception with the right amount of spices and right taste. All in all, I visit here very often and the quality of food and the service always amazes me. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...!!!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food/service/personnel! Great value! Worth the 3.5 hour drive we made to get here. We will be back. Gladly we arrived minutes ahead of the dinner hour and were seated before the place totally filled up with locals who knew well the wonderful delights of this great Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Portions were small for the price, and food was bland.  Server was a little shady with how he asked us what kind of bread we wanted with our entrée, implying it came with the meal. However, when asked to clarify, the bread costs additional.  There are better Indian places, avoid this one."}
{"text":"I went to Yuva India after getting back from Thanksgiving break. It was cold. I was starving. It was close.  My friend and I ventured over there, and I was kind of disappointed.  The service was pretty inattentive. Somehow, there was a mix up, and the staff thought there was an additional party member at our table. I tried to tell them this as they poured extra water and left an extra menu, but they completely ignored what I said. They later seemed kind of irritated when they figured out that there wasn't another person joining us.  The food was decent, although I got the wrong dish. I ordered chicken tikka and ended up with chicken tikka masala haha. The sauce was pretty flavorful and slightly spicy though, so that was good.  I'm not sure if its worth going back to though."}
{"text":"I recently returned in a simular situation as my last visit. The wait staff were, again, attentive, and three dishes were placed on each table. However, I was not as impressed by their food this time.  We started off with the pappadom as an appetizer. Although it had a heavy herb taste, it was also very salty. The chutneys alleviated this somewhat, but I still wasn't a fan. Then, we had chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, tarka daal, and chana masala served with naan and rice.   My first impression of the chicken tandoori was, again, salty. The chicken itself was well-cooked, and it would've been great with a bit less salt. I found the other three dishes okay, but the chana masala was the only one with any distinctive taste, and even that was mostly spiciness. (Thankfully, it was at a level well within my tolerance.) I didn't find any of them to be great, though. The naan was delicious, as was the rice, which seemed to have another light flavor from herbs or something.   For dessert, we finished off with kheer, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Overall, it's a nice, cozy restaurant, but I think there are better Indian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, really tasty at a reasonable price, too! A lunch portion includes rice, salad, naan, and the entree. All are fresh and delicious. Very good food, friendly atmostphere,  and clean restaurant. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We came here and used the groupon deal. It was pretty busy, but the waitstaff seemed to handle it pretty well. The food is delicious. I ordered the garlic naan and kadhai paneer, my SO ordered the goat vindaloo. We enjoyed the meal very much. However, the portions are so small. I could have eaten at least two portions of my meal. I left still hungry. The cost is a bit pricey considering how small the portions are."}
{"text":"I used to like this place for a well balanced light lunch.  They have seemed to have Americanized the menu by raising prices, creating larger portions and serving  totally bland food.  My butter chicken tasted like tomato soup. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Great food with great, friendly service! The decor is much much better than any Indian place in Pittsburgh. It is probably pricier than the other Pittsburgh Indian joints. Yuva's portions are normal sized, they are not small! The other Indian places have huge portions. I grew up eating Indian-type food, and trust me no normal sized person eats THAT much biriyani or chicken tikka masala for dinner.  The quality at Yuva is much better than anywhere in Pittsburgh, except for Udipi of course. We got the goat biriyani and the butter chicken. Really good cooking and flavorful food. I hate those Indian places where mild foods taste bland. Here the medium butter chicken was creamy and had a slightly sweet undertone. The goat biriyani was spicy though! If you are a medium spice level eater at other Indian places, you might want to go with a mild here. It's always easier to add pepper if you need to. And please don't go the lunch buffet way. Keep it classy."}
{"text":"I am a semi-regular visitor. In other reviews, I have noticed lots of complaints regarding customer service, but in my opinion there isn't a significant difference between the service in this place and elsewhere. Courteous and quick enough for me.  The food is good if you order it spicy. Their Baingan Bhartha especially is quite delicious. The other items on the menu are also in general tasty and well-prepared (though I wouldn't recommend the Dal Tadka, it isn't what you are used to if you are Indian.)  Overall I'm giving this place 4 stars out of 5 because of two reasons:  1) They serve rice with every dish and do not allow for substitutions. To be fair, this appears to be the general practice in all Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh that I've been to; this is remarkably pointless and inauthentic. It makes absolutely no sense to serve rice with a majority of the dishes on the menu, especially the dry dishes. This is the biggest reason I do not go there more frequently, and I almost gave a 3 star rating because of this. If you work at Yuva India and you are reading this, I sincerely suggest that you allow your customers to replace the rice with some basic butter naan. If that is too expensive for you, at least include an option to upgrade the rice to naan for a small price.  2) In my opinion the price is a little too high. The food here is quite good, but there are other Indian places that serve equally good food at a lower price. (Nearby Tamarind comes to mind)."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and ordered a vegetarian meal, and there was chicken in it. The first time I asked the server assured me it was paneer. The second time the server claimed it was fine because the \"sauce is the same anyway\". Then the manager was rude. First and last time I've ever walked out of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Best indian food in pittsburgh..have been eating here for three years....have not been disappointed even once..the flavors are authentic.."}
{"text":"The butter chicken lunch barely has any chicken.  When I asked the waiter about it, she just shrugged and said that this is how the lunch is.  I'm very disappointed in my meal- if it was mostly sauce, the description should have said so instead of describing it as a chicken dish..."}
{"text":"I work in Oakland and order Yuva very frequently! It's definitely my top choice of Indian food in the entire Pittsburgh region. I moved from LA recently where I had hands down the best food selections available. I haven't found much in comparison here in the burgh, except for Yuva. Great service, quick, very affordable and the portions are plentiful. I definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 if possible.  Pros: 1) Dal Tadka is insanely good.  2) Bhindi is good 3) Chicken biryani is decent 4) Good service  Cons: 1) Quantity is low for the price you pay 2) You can count all of 4 pieces of paneer that they give you for paneer makhani 3) Lunch is ok but dinner is too expensive"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch plate. We got the plates that included the Vindaloo and Butter Chicken respectively. Tons of flavor, generous portion, fast service and friendly staff. It's not a 5 star restaurant, but for lunch or take out, I'll definitely be back.  The food didn't feel too fattening and wasn't greasy. They used higher end ingredients versus the cheaper gamey meats sometimes used in Indian food."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place looking for a late dinner after a zine fair in Highland Park. Familiar with Oakland, we drove over and found easy parking, welcomed by a very nice staff and a good-vibes atmosphere. I tried paneer palak for the first time at Yuva Indian and immediately fell in love - I have always been one for Indian cuisine and had been eager to try this dish. The paneer palak was creamy, perfectly tasty, and spicy! The waiter asks you regarding spice level; I usually get the spiciest when I go out for Asian cuisine, and I would say the dish was spicy but certainly allowed for taste of dynamic Indian flavors. I discovered Yuva Indian with a friend who had never before tried such flavorful cuisine - I would say this is a great eatery for someone new to Indian - very round flavors and sauces. My friend tried the chicken tikka masala and loved it. Ever since going to Yuva Indian my love for such a culture has only grown as I explore my own abilities cooking Indian food and seek out other tasty ethnic food joints in the Pittsburgh area. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When me and my friend first walked in to Yuva, we were surprised to find an empty, quiet restaurant on a Saturday night on Craig Street. However, the interior design was clean and put together, which is a quality often lacking in (dive-y) Indian restaurants.   When we were given the menu, we noticed that the options were far more scarce and expensive than listed on the website. That said, a vegetarian dish is far more expensive than other Indian locales, clocking in at $13 rather than $8-10 like most places.   When I ordered my dinner, I asked if I could get the vegetarian option but with chickpeas added to the vegetables. I would have been willing to pay a few dollars more for added protein, as the vegetable curry featured only broccoli, cauliflower, and peppers. The waiter, who seemed to not know what a chickpea was, said I would be charged for two curries: the one I intended on order and the only other curry featuring chickpeas. It was confusing, but I backed down and stuck with the regular vegetables.   When my dish came- the \"Killer Curry\"- my experience improved. The Killer Curry was extremely spicy, which is just to my liking. The basmati rice, while not being spiced or flavored, was nicely cooked, and the entree came with a salad, which was a nice, refreshing touch! I finished the whole dish in one sitting, and the waiter told me I am only the third person to have finished the Killer Curry.   Conclusion: if you're looking for a bustling restaurant, go at lunchtime. That will be the only other time I go there because the prices are better and it will be more crowded. Also, no substitutions in dishes unless you'd like to be charged for TWO expensive curries rather than one."}
{"text":"A new Indian place in my work-'hood? Of course I had to go check it out!  Yuva India is in the same location as the now defunct Star of India. I do not know any of the details about the change of hands, but the restaurant space was closed for about a month for remodeling and Yuva India had their soft opening sometime this past week.  Regarding taste, the food was alright. When trying a new Indian restaurant, I look to one of two dishes that are common in restaurants to find out about their cooking: mattar paneer (mattar are English peas, paneer is a soft, mild flavored cheese, in a tomato sauce) OR malai kofta (a vegetable croquette made with ground veggies like carrots and potatoes and peas, sometimes with paneer, golden raisins, or cashews. These sit in a cream sauce that is either with a tomato base or an onion/butter base). The mattar paneer was good. The tomato sauce tasted fresher that what I've found elsewhere and had more tomato chunks than is usual. Pretty good, though the small serving of rice isn't enough for the amount of sauce. The potato cutlet was also pretty good; I would suggest it IF it is the kind of thing you are apt to like.  I'm feeling list-y, so let's go with that:  PROS: +Clean, contemporary, and updated dining room. Bright warm colors on the walls with large photographs hung around and new laminate flooring. Feels spiffy. +Courteous and pleasant wait staff. Very attentive. The service didn't feel like you were at a place in their first week of soft opening. +They have chaat and poori on the menu. I don't see that much around PGH, so if you like those, you can find them here. If you've never heard of it, I can't give a full definition but to say they fall into a savory snack category and frequently have puffed rice or toasted vermicelli topped with things like chutneys or yogurt. Not my thing, but it may be yours.  CONS: -Price. Expect to pay a few bucks more (for almost all items) than you typically pay at other Indian places. It adds up. Tea ($4) , mattar paneer ($12) and a potato cutlet ($4.50) were $22 after taxes. That's high for Pittsburgh prices and for a casual Indian restaurant.  -They don't make their masala chai. So, $4 for a 6 oz. cup of hot water and a chai tea bag seems crazy to me. No refill, by the way.  GOOD TO KNOW: The heat scale is mild-medium-& hot. Medium here is about a 6-7 elsewhere, so they skew on the hot side. If you usually get medium and that is pressing your limits, it will likely be too hot for you here.  For me, this place will not be on my regular rotation of Indian joints I frequent unless their pricing changes. However, the food is decent, the atmosphere is nice, and the service is good. It is certainly worth a try if you are in the neighborhood to see for yourself."}
{"text":"I love indian food and know it well. I think they have such a great location that it does not matter if the food is good. People continue to go to this location. The new Indian resteraunt that opened on south craig ,next to the beer distributaries is awesome. The buffet is amazing, and unfortunately it was closed for a late lunch and so was tamarind. I gave it a second try and my friend could not eat her palak paneer. Tasteless and expensive. Continue to walk past this place to the buffet on south craig, trust me on this one, I just returned from India."}
{"text":"Tried this place out today, absolutely fantastic! A bit pricy, but worth every penny. By far the best garlic nann i have ever had. Some of the best Indian food I have had outside of India!"}
{"text":"No cleanliness. Came at 9 PM on weekday, already started cleaning (closing time was 10). They said they will still serve. The person doing the mopping didn't wash hands and gave me menu card and then water  I left the place."}
{"text":"Good Indian food but overpriced with poor service by management and staff. They did not honor the discount provided on their menu after taking student ids and asking for orders. When we discussed the issue politely with management after finishing our meal, they responded that there was nothing they could do as their hands were tied."}
{"text":"Empty on a Friday night with the employee's kids yelling and playing tag around the tables. I complained about the noise then got extremely rude stares from the staff. When eating my leftovers the following day found a grown adult's finger nail in my food..."}
{"text":"Really expensive for small portions of mediocre food. What a disappointment. $15 for Chicken Tandori which consisted of two legs (they may have come from a pigeon, I'm not sure) and maybe a half a thigh"}
{"text":"Today for the first time we ordered a Vegetable Biryani as a takeaway order from Yuva. When I opened the box and started eating, I saw a chicken piece in my food. Generally, I am not very severe on a mistake in serving the wrong food item. But providing non-vegetarian meal instead of a vegetarian meal is a grave mistake. Especially since it is an Indian cuisine place. An Indian restaurant should be aware of the Indian sentiment when it comes to vegetarian & non-vegetarian food.   The worst part actually was the owner's reaction to this mistake. They didn't seem very apologetic either about it. This was a very sad experience."}
{"text":"I placed a takeout order from Yuva through GrubHub. It said the order would be ready in 30 minutes and so I arrived 20 minutes after I ordered it, expecting to wait a few minutes after I found a parking spot (no easy feat on S. Craig St.). When I got inside and told the lady at the counter that I was picking up a takeout order, she said they still had not received it. As I was calling GrubHub customer service, she \"happened\" to find it as I got through to an agent and rushed it to the kitchen. I asked the agent to look into it and admittedly the order failed to be delivered the first two times, whether due to a failing on GrubHub's part or Yuva's part, I do not know. However, it was confirmed that the order had made it through ten minutes earlier.  At long last, when we had our food and made it home, we tried the food and were utterly disappointed. The samosas were poor compared to others I have had, a tough maneuver to pull off given they are usually frozen samosas anyhow. We also had bhaigan bhartha and kofta curry (known at authentic Indian places as malai kofta), both of which were a major disappointment. I have had malai kofta at many different Indian restaurants and this was the least flavorful I have ever experienced. The bhaigan bhartha, on the other hand, was charred so much that the smoke level nearly exceeded every Scotch in existence. We requested that both be made spicy and neither were. I will certainly never be going back. I highly recommend Taj Mahal on McKnight and Taste of India near the Children's Hospital if you want actually good Indian food."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at Yuva with excellent, friendly, attentive service. And they serve alcohol here! That's awesome as Indian restaurants never serve alcohol!  I've eaten at 10+ different Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh (some no longer with us, RIP Mirchi which was amazing), and this was the best korma I've had in a while (since Mirchi closed). Super flavorful and the goat was excellent. I love that they give you a salad on the side! It's a great palate cleanser with all of the spicy food. (We like it hot).   The portions were plenty. I think the way that they serve the food and the bowl might give people the impression that they are getting less than other Indian restaurants, but it's a deep bowl. I was stuffed and kept trying to eat more and just finished my leftovers (next day). I'm at home so I'm allowed to lick the bowl --and I did.   My sig other had the lamb vindaloo. I kept going for his with my naan too! Very good. He was able to finish his meal (dude can put away some food), but was threatening not being able to walk home afterwards.   Needless to say, the portions are a-plenty.   We also had a stuffed pepper appetizer that was good, but the dinners were the star. The mango lassi was tasty. I had a nice glass of wine (large wine portion too).   Expensive? We ordered the two most expensive dinners with the most expensive meats and that was $31. We ordered appetizer, drinks (1 alcohol), dinners, 2 orders of naan and got to the $60s which is what we spend everywhere when we order the same. So no, the price was not unreasonable.   The different approach to the menu doesn't really make the menu that much smaller. It just lists everything more efficiently. They have tandori, tikka masala, korma, vindalo, aloo gobi, naan, biryani, dahl, etc. It's just listed in a way that makes a more efficient use of space. It's really the kind of Indian restaurant that you can take a non-indian food lover to and they can safely order something that they will enjoy while you still can enjoy a spicy flavor 'splosion.  We live in the burbs, so we aren't in Oakland often, but the next time we are I know that I'm going here. Sorry Lulus."}
{"text":"Yuva is a cute place located at a convenient location, but it fails when directly compared to other Indian restaurants in the area. The service was horrible with a waitress who barely understood English. The dinner portions were supposed to be family style, but they barely gave us enough food for just one person. For the amount of food, I thought Yuva was a tad expensive.   Their tandoori chicken was too dry and bland. The dish literally tasted like plain grilled chicken without much seasoning (I do NOT recommend). The chicken tikka masala was fairly decent with a nice and creamy sauce, but there was pretty much only sauce...where's the chicken? I did enjoy the aloo gobi dish (cauliflower and potatoes), although it was a bit too spicy for my taste buds.    Overall, the food at Yuva was decent, but not superb. I don't think the service, food quality and quantity were enough for the price that they charge."}
{"text":"The good: The food here is incredibly delicious. They really do a good job with the quality/quantity of food. We've had many different dishes, and they are all top notch.  So why the 3 stars? The service is remarkably bad. Allow me to explain; it's not that the servers are douches or anything like that. In fact, they are pretty nice. But the timing out of the kitchen is really really bad. Both times that I have been here, we have waited for our food for an hour. Now, to be fair, the food is good enough that we were willing to wait, but at no time did someone come out and warn us how long it was going to take, or even apologize to us about the wait.   I think they have their act together for lunch - my guess is that they have a bunch of stuff already prepped in back for that time period. But for dinner? Hit or miss in terms of timing. We saw other tables of two have their orders taken and food brought out and be done with their meal before we ever saw any action at our table. So, maybe the secret is to come in party sizes less than four. Whatever the secret is, just be forewarned: don't come here if you have somewhere you need to be in a hurry afterwards."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while on a visit to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, which is just steps away. We ordered off the lunch menu which included an entree, salad, rice and fresh naan. Food came out very fast and the staff was very polite/accommodating. This isn't the best Indian I've had, but the food was pretty tasty, especially the naan. Everyone in my family enjoyed it even my sometimes picky kids. To top off the off the experience, my five year old was proudly telling everyone it was his birthday and then they surprised us by serving him a complimentary slice of Oreo cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Relatively certain that the base of the chicken tikka masala is canned tomato soup. The pre-packaged or frozen Indian food at Whole Foods or Trader Joe's is better."}
{"text":"This is one of my my favorites if not my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. It's a bit pricy for me as a college student, but the atmosphere is very modern, it feels like a higher-end authentic restaurant in India, the food is delicious, and the staff is very friendly. You really get what you pay for, if not more.  I would recommend going in for lunch because dinner is more expensive, but the food is superb regardless. Their naan comes with almost every meal and, I'm not kidding, it's the best naan I have ever eaten in my life. The fluffiness and texture of the bread is always perfect and always contains the right balance of sweetness and saltiness. I would recommend ordering one of their dishes that come with rice, curry, naan, and freshly tossed salad; you can't go wrong with those. I have come to realize that after eating Indian food, I always feel tired and lethargic shortly afterwards, but never at Yuva. Their food often makes me feel light, healthy, and provides sufficient energy for me to tackle the rest of my day.  Aside from the food, their staff is very friendly and always welcome me with a warm smile. I tend to drink a lot of water, and not one time has my cup been empty due to constant refills. They ask if everything is okay periodically during your meal, to ensure that you are satisfied and have all your needs fulfilled. When you are done eating, they always hand you the check at the right time not making you feel rushed, and they always wish you well as you walk out the door.   Overall, the dining experience at Yuva is remarkable and rises well above the average restaurant. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a satisfying lunch!"}
{"text":"My first time to try the indian  food. Everything is great. Love the nong and all the spicy sauses."}
{"text":"We had the samosas and the saag paneer. Absolutely delicious and perfect spice level - medium spice is perfect for those who like spicy food but aren't necessarily looking for a challenge!  It's a little pricier than your standard Indian in Pittsburgh, but it's worth it!  Not too greasy.  They definitely add their own flair.  Service was great, and the atmosphere was meh to relaxing. Nice light fixtures.  We're not too big on ethos though."}
{"text":"Lunch is pretty good, but dinner is a bit pricey. Food has improved since it opened, as has service. I get the lunch option, which comes with rice and a salad (still not sure why they serve this...).  People in my group in the past have been unhappy with the authenticity of some of the dishes, but now it seems they warn people in advance if the dish is being prepared in a surprising way. I've had their chicken vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, and their paneer makhani, and each were good."}
{"text":"Passable but not great.  Their best feature is staying open late (10pm).  Their \"hot\" aloo gobi is what I would consider \"medium\" spicy."}
{"text":"I usually don't do this, but I am going to say it was just o.k.  I went there for dinner to try something new.  I got the chole and my date had the dal makni.  We ordered the samosa and garlic nan.  I was going to order another appetizer, but the waiter said that you couldn't choose the spicyness of the appetizer.  He then explained that you are able to pick the spiceyness of the main dish.  This leads me to believe that the appetizer is pre-made and not made to order.  As someone from this region I am utterly sick of this kind of approach.  You are in the hospitality industry, bend to the wim of the customer!  The samosa's came rather quickly and there was 2 of them.  So, that means I got to eat one samosa and Elisabeth got to eat one samosa.  Would you even call that an appetizer?  Our dishes came out and they were not tiny, but not that great of a portion size.  Although you do get a salad with the small bowl of food and some basmati rice was it, maybe?  I am glad that we ordered nan and the appetizer because I would have ended up very hungry.  I like that they are trying new spins on Indian food, but there was nothing that really excited me and made me want to come back.  I did try some of Elisabeth's dal makni.  I have never had black lentils before so that sparked my interest, but it tasted like a dull combination of chili and soup.  The service was speedy, but the staff is like their food very unexciting.  Oh and I was going to order alo gobi and the lion stout originally, but there were out of both  :(  P.S. - the website makes it seem as though there is a bar an area to hang out in, but there is no such thing.  The bar is basically the check out counter, it is very small.  I would hardly call it an actual bar.  You can order from like 7 choices of beer that come in bottles, no taps whatsoever.    It reminds me of what India garden when it was on Atwood would have, King Fisher, Lion, Sam Adams...etc."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, since I love Indian food and it's so close to where I work. I had a discount coupon from Restaurant.com for $15 off a minimum purchase of $22.50, so my friend and I came for lunch.   I eat vegan, so I was happy to see clear markings for anyone vegan, gluten-free, or vegetarian. The best option for me was the Vegetarian Lunch, which offers salad, rice, a side of Tarka Daal,  and a side of Chana Masala, which for some reason isn't vegan here. I asked if I could have two Daals instead, but was not allowed, unless I changed to the more expensive \"Pick any two sides and one naan\" special, but naan is not vegan either. So my friend ordered the Yuva Lunch, I ordered the Vegetarian Lunch anyway (I gave the chana to my friend), and we ordered masala fries to share, to spend the minimum for the coupon, which I presented to our server at that time.  My friend's meal seemed good, my meal was kinda just okay. The salad and rice were okay, the daal was not great (very soupy and bland), and the portions were smaller than I expected. The fries were good but pretty silly: basically a small order of McDonald's fries with a little spice rubbed on, and a big side of ketchup. I thought that I would have felt ripped off, if I was paying full-price.  After our meal we handed our coupon over, our waiter disappeared, and then brought it back, saying it was only good for use at dinner. I was confused since I had read the coupon over and checked with our waiter beforehand, so I asked to see where on the coupon it mentioned this, but he insisted it was no good. I didn't want to trouble them anymore, so we just paid the full amount.   Good thing Restaurant.com allows you to exchange unused coupons for credit elsewhere, because it was not really worth it that time or to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service, if you love Indian food and Indian strong beer then go here you will thank me and your belly. I had an amazing time and I was there all by myself. They have bollywood playing on a bigscreen and the food is to die for. Please make sure you check it out. Thank you Yuva!"}
{"text":"This is a really great place as far as lunch in concerned. Their lunch menu is revamped and is really the best you could get, where every entree is composed of two-three different food items. The service is usually good. You should surely give it a try!  Any combination lunch which has \"Butter Chicken\" would be great !"}
{"text":"The food is good but the flavors are a bit too \"americanized\" for me. Everything I've had here tasted under-spiced and the chicken has been tough. The mango lassi is good, but that's pretty hard to mess up... The prices are kind of steep considering the amount of food you get, too. The restaurant decor is cute and clean but it feels very open and empty during off-hours since the dining area is just a single open room. They close between lunch and dinner so plan accordingly.  If you're craving indian food I suggest skipping this place and going up the street to Tamarind instead."}
{"text":"it's a OK place. the fried chili is pretty good. lassi is a bit weird taste but it's ok for an exotic drink. the atmosphere and internal decoration are great. overall this is a fun place to eat"}
{"text":"I have visited this place often. Not only because they offer tasty food but also because of the smile and friendliness of the owner. I have always felt comfortable dining there whether alone or with friends."}
{"text":"I went there a month ago had the most embarrassing situation of my life. I had already informed the lady owner of the coupon and only then ordered the food. She in the end refused to take the Yelp 30$for 40$ worth of food !! She said she hadn't heard of any such coupon deal for her restaurant (which by the way I have been seeing on Yuva eatery page on yelp for the last 1 year!) She said first of all she did a favor on us by accepting this weird coupon but now she wants us to tip at least 20% or more to the staff!!!! She started arguing vehemently at the dinner table in front of other customers and staff and shouting!! She kept embarrassing us and  never stopped shouting!! I did not know what to do. I wanted to run away as she did not even let me explain or talk at all. The food was just average with very small portions.  I complained to Yelp about the situation and they were very co operative and refunded our money. I am never going back again. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"The sole waiter in the restaurant was too aggressive and pushed us to eat way more than we possibly consume, without having a chance to review the menu.   We ordered a mild Chicken Tikka.  It came way too spicy.  We told the waiter, who told the mother of the owner that we were sending the dish back.  She complete lost it with us, went totally crazy and said we've been here for 34 years.  When we explained that we ordered mild not spicy she gave us the \"talk to the hand\" signal and began to rant at us. The waiter brought the dish back and said you might as well eat it because you're paying for it. I don't think so! I can't imagine how they have remained in business for so long.  The other dish was moderately OK, and we asked for a little salad, but he made a giant salad and charged an entire price. The food was NOT good and the attitude was completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends after seeing an exhibit at CMOA. I recommended this restaurant because of its close proximity and also to try something new. I forewarned them that based on the Yelp reviews that it was A-ok but not stellar. So I didn't have high expectations.   I ended up really liking my meal. I ordered the Bhindi masala and asked for not too spicy which they designated as being medium spicy. I went with it and there was definitely a kick to my dish. The texture was more on the dry side (not a lot of sauce). The mixture of okra, onions, tomatoes, coriander and other spices was delicious and fresh. It was reasonably priced at $12.50 and it came with basmati rice and a small side salad. Other reviewers complained about the price, but for dinner and its ample portion, I thought it was a great deal.  In terms of ambiance, it's more of a modern/casual take on traditional Indian cuisine. Silverware are already placed on tables in caddies and water did come in large plastic cups. Service was attentive but we were one of two parties in the restaurant.   I will certainly try Yuva again."}
{"text":"Love this place - fresh, clean and great service. The offerings are unique, authentic and reasonable in price."}
{"text":"I have checked in here once with siblings for lunch in October 2012 and then a few more times for lunch in Summer 2014. The interior was gorgeous with the nice upholstery and pictures on the wall and the ambiance is perfect for a cloudy fall day in the Burgh. The cleanliness is great considering the stereotype that Indian restaurants are grimy.  As for the food, I thought it was above average for each of my visits and the lunch specials are good but a bit too high based on the amount of food.   The service was average- the food came out pretty slow but the attentiveness of the waiters helped to make up for that.   Overall a nice place to have lunch before perusing the Carnegie Museums across the street."}
{"text":"Was a really nice experience to have lunch here. Especially when the craving was for Indian food. Chicken Tikka n Butter Chicken Combos were delicious. Got a feeling of mini India in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner there. Ordered pani-puri as starter. Hated it. Too bland and tasteless. Would totally recommend against it.  The main course was good. Order Paneer Tikka Masala, and it was creamy and tasty. Nan was delicious too. Overall, avoid starters and jump directly to the main course."}
{"text":"Service was great and the atmosphere is extremely inviting! Food was also good for the price though not the best Indian food i've ever had. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Decent lunch with poor service.  When I first walked into the place, I was blown away. The restaurant has been newly remodeled and it looks great! There's a very hip feel and it's very clean. I liked the simplicity of the lunch menu.  Though the place is small, it seems to be understaffed. There were three different waiters bringing around water but it appeared that only one person was taking orders. Wait time for the order to be place was about 15 minutes-- way too long for lunch. Wait time for the food was about 20 minutes-- also way too long for lunch.  The meal was good and for that reason I will return. The price and service, however, were not as I would have expected."}
{"text":"I have found this place to be pretty good. I had heard some negative comments from some friends however to me at least since late 2012, the food has been good and the ambience as well as the service pretty decent.  Vegetarian options served are a quite less than what I would expect from  a restaurant serving North Indian cuisine but the ones that are available are good in quality."}
{"text":"The Pizza Hut of Indian Food: Decor is nice but then water arrives in plastic Pepsi cups. Silverware and napkins self serve on cheap wooden tables. I ordered chicken saag which had disgusting huge chunks of cardamom. Lentils were ordered low spice and came as a 6/10. I had an immediate MSG reaction to the food: hot and red. Despite not eating any naan, I woke up very puffy next morning. I had a Groupon that Never Expires (says so right on the voucher) that they REFUSED to honor. Will not go back, especially with many other amazing Indian restaurants within walking distance or a short drive away."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now, and all of the dishes I've tried have been solidly \"meh.\"  The chicken tikka masala was flavorless and not well-seasoned (despite my having specified a decent spice level).  The mango lassi and naan are fine, but it's hard to screw them up.  You know it's not a good sign when you can't recall what you ordered (and I usually do--read my other reviews!).   Service is always slow and inattentive, except for the water guy.  There are definitely better Indian options two blocks up Craig.; I suggest you take advantage of them."}
{"text":"Went there again after a long time after hearing that their lunch menu has become really impressive and I was quite pleased ! I had the maseladar lunch which consisted of butter chicken , butter nan, salad and basmati rice. The butter chicken was creamy, well made and delicious. It was quite a hearty meal. Will be back for lunch again some day."}
{"text":"My first visit. Definitely going back. More than just the standard curry and vindaloo."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  This is real home made Indian food, with a lot of care given to the spices, freshness and preparation of the food.  I recommend both the samosas as an appetizer and the tandoori chicken as an entrée -- the marinade is fantastic.  The staff, service and ambiance were just as good.  I plan to return."}
{"text":"I was happy to see this place when the Carnegie Cafe had no decent veggie options and I needed food fast before an afternoon event.  Nothing remarkable, but it was tasty and filled up my tummy!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! We just relocated here from the West Coast and I must say, I have been quite the food snob. But Yuva has really impressed me. We had lunch here and it was a great deal! $8 for 2 different dish samples, and salad.   I recommend the butter chicken-it was fabulous! The chicken tasted like it just came off the grill and the sauce was super flavorful! Also, the Naan was realllllllyyyyyy good!  The hub had Tikka Masala which was also good, but I really like the butter chicken.  Pros: Atmosphere (interior decorations are really cool!), Service (super attentive and friendly),  Food (yum), Pitt student discount (score!) Lunch Specials (very filling!)  Cons:I was too full for dessert! ;)"}
{"text":"We came into the restaurant 2 hours before it was suppose to close for dinner prep, but after we were seated we were told that they were closing 1 hour early and had 45 minutes for lunch. We figured that it wouldn't be a big inconvenience, though it was unexpected because there was no reason for the restaurant to deviate from their posted hours. The waiter never brought us water, and reminded us every 10 minutes while we were eating of the closing time. Additionally, the food was very watery and hardly had flavor. Being rushed by the waiter plus the unsatisfying food made this a poor experience. You'll have a better experience at any other Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic experience!    I went with my boyfriend for a lunch date and we were promptly seated only moments after arriving.  The hostess was courteous and upbeat. You could tell she was genuinely happy to be there (which in my experience is uncommon).  The service was fast and well-timed! She knew exactly when to stop by to see if we were ready to order.   The meal was excellent!  Very nicely presented! I got the spice lunch and enjoyed it very much. I'm so glad naan bread already comes with it instead of being extra (I LOVE naan bread, I'm pretty sure I have an addiction).  I had a restaurant.com certificate with me and when the hostess noticed it she came over and happily enquired if I would like to use it. FINALLY! A restaurant establishment that doesn't make me feel like a bad person for having a coupon!    Final Thought:  Great atmosphere, fantastic service, delicious food.  I recommended this place to all!"}
{"text":"(+)ves  I love the way the place looks (they renovated it) - very Indian! Lunch specials are decent. On Craig - very close to CMU n UPitt.  (-)ves Very rare that it turns out to be a quick meal. Less quantities for the prices they charge."}
{"text":"I read most of the posts on this place and I agree with some of the things they say. The portions are smaller, the prices slightly higher. Some may think they are charging more for the upscale decor. Well, in my opinion, so be it. Finally I found a place where I can even take my customers for an Indian meal and not have to worry about looking like a cheapskate ! the renovated ambiance is great and if they can get a full bar, linen napkins and get rid of the cheesy bollywood music and TV, then I will say that they have something no other Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh has - atmosphere ! The food was very good, too so I have absolutely no complaints with the kitchen. The seekh kebabs were thick and moist and the Malai Koftas just right. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I think they have become really good in the past year (different menus? different management/chef?). I still think it is a tad over-priced what with $14 for a normal veggie entree, but their lunch specials are $10. I went here several times in the same week because it was convenient. I wish their \"veggie lunch\" had something other than palak paneer. I loved this, but I had to eat this every visit because the only other veggie option was paneer makhni or to order ala carte which was $14 without tax + tips.  I liked their thali which was surprisingly filling with dal maakhni (which tasted *very* good). Don't buy the \"killer curry\". It is just some tomato sauce, just hot chilly powder and veggies which seems to be made up for the American clientele. You'd be better off with the traditional Indian dishes.   I really think they have gone from a one-star experience from previous years to 3-star. The host was a very nice and kind woman. If you are on campus at CMU and cannot trudge all the way to the end of N.Craig street on a cold day, this is a really good option."}
{"text":"items are hit or miss but terrible value for your money! I ordered the appetizer tasting platter, chickpea curry, and tawa roti. the chickpea curry was great, but a huge portion, way way way too much for the tiny side of rice.  also..payed 2.50 for roti (plus .25 cents extra for tawa? ) and they gave me ONE PIECE. It's actually laughable. The sampling platter was only three things, the samosas were only okay, the other two were the cheapest appetizers they have..terrible selection. Pissed I wasted 23 dollars on all of that. Stay away!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time, and my husband is threatening to never eat in another restaurant on this block again. He wants to come back and order the mild chicken dhaba again, and again, and again. I had the medium tarka daal. The garlic naan was well done. Nice service and reasonable prices. We'll be back (obvi)."}
{"text":"The absolute worst! The food is terrible and unfortunately the service is even worse. Want something to drink???? Then you better flag someone down. Want to actually order food??? Then you better wave them down again, cause no one is asking.  Want your Indian food to have spice and flavor??? THEN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!! So even with all of this awfulness they still managed to get worse. When we brought it to the woman's attention that our food was poor she brought out , cold from the fridge sause and told us to mix it in our already cold food. This one sause was supposed to \"save\" 8 entrées.....nice try. We then spoke to the \"manager\" Who took $2 off of our meals, but then had the audacity to add automatic gratuity! Meanwhile.....all this time.....still not one persons asks if we want more drinks!!! This is Restaurant 101 people.  I'm still in disbelief of the poor experience we had there."}
{"text":"Really good food, albeit not too great value for money. Try Mango Lassi here : Heavenly!"}
{"text":"Raw and uncook samosa .. Cholle was good and if we ask them very spicy then it is possible"}
{"text":"So, I came back here and went with the suggestion that the waiter gave me last time, which was to just order the goat curry from the dinner menu even though it was lunch time. I did just that, and asked for it to be medium spicy.  Needless to say, it was one of the best goat curries I've enjoyed around the city. I think this will be my new go to dish at Indian places, as I used to be a strictly Chicken Tikka Masala sort of girl.  I tried a samosa as well on my second time around, and although they were clearly handmade and the flavors were great, I thought charging $2 for a samosa that small was ridiculous (especially when you get can one at least twice the size across the street for a dollar). On a brighter note, the mint chutney that accompanied it was delightful and I used it as a nice balance to the heat of the curry.  The staff was pleasant and helpful, as usual. The decor of the joint still is really beautiful, bright, and clean. I accidentally went a little close to their closing for lunch and did feel a little rushed, but that's a silly mistake on my part. This place is good if you know the right things to get!"}
{"text":"Returning home for Thanksgiving from Chicago ( boasts an Indian neighborhood ...Devon), my family always visited Star of India sometime during the Holiday. Never had a bad meal there. I eat Indian food frequently and after reading the Yuva reviews I was skeptical. We went Sat evening and couldn't have been more pleased. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, the service was efficient and friendly and the food...the food was sophisticated, authentically spiced (as far as I know) and just delicious. We were impressed and will return."}
{"text":"I should probably do this as two different reviews, but oh well, they get one.  I've come here for lunch many times with friends. They have some of the best tadka daal and I LOVE it (don't tell my mother in law). It's not a typical Indian lunch as they serve it with a fresh salad as well and in cute little bowls on your plate. It's good though perhaps a bit overpriced.  However, I work for a non-profit and when trying to use my purchasing card for a business meal they refused to refund the tax charged (we are tax exempt). This to me seems like bad business practices and hence why I will not give them 4 stars, only 3."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and our waitress was helpful with suggestions. We waited about 25 minutes for our check once we were finished and tried to make eye contact with the wait staff. Next time, I will just order take out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend found this restaurant after visiting the comic book store on Craig street.  We decided to go here for dinner later that night.  This was the grand opening and the staff was very pleasant.  I believe it was the owner that waited on us and she was very sweet and helped us make selections.  We told her we couldn't handle spice...but people don't realize just how baby-ish we really are about it.  So when they say, it's a 3 out of 10 (like the dish I ordered)...it's still spicy to me.  That being said I actually really liked the flavor of my dish.  I apologize for not remembering the entire name, but it was something chicken/masala/spinach.  My boyfriend got something lamb/josh.  His was spicier than mine ( a 4 out of 10 on their scale).  I could see the looks of pity from the staff as we downed glass after glass of water (even asking for a pitcher to be left at the table...)  I don't want to scare people away!  My food was really good and I ate it all, it just had kick, which normal people seem to enjoy.    The decor is very soothing and the space is modern.  I really liked the color palette.  I really want to like this place, but I think Indian food, in general, may not be for me.  I gave this 4 stars because, even though I don't like spice, it could be worth checking out if you do."}
{"text":"Yuva is a good place for quick a lunch if you're in North Oakland and craving some solid Indian food. Their lunch menu includes a salad, some naan, and some rice, along with whichever entree you choose (they have a few combinations).  Nice people, nice business, a-ok. Their chicken tikka masala definitely satisfies a craving that the other Indian joints in Oakland don't quite reach."}
{"text":"Just meh. The nan was glorious - fat, soft buttery pillows of yum. Side salad comes with all combos and is essentially iceberg lettuce. Had the tikki masala lunch and received 5 small chunks of chicken in a very mild sauce - no seasoning whatsoever. Service was attentive, decor is clean and modern. The menu was very limited and way overpriced for the quantity. Won't return."}
{"text":"I got the Tandoori chicken. It's was ok. It might have just tasted better cause I was hungry so I definitely have to try it again. The rice was a bit dry and I wish I had a sauce to eat it with. However the naan was really good and they gave a good bit. The service was eh honestly. They close from 3-5 on Saturdays and they were really passive aggressive about kicking us out."}
{"text":"No.  No.  No.  When you walk into Yuva, you may be impressed by the tasteful decor, but don't let your eyes fool you, this place was awful from top to bottom.  When we first arrived we were waited on by several people, but as time went on, we couldn't even find a person to take our order.  Once we finally placed our order, we waited forever for the food to come out.  We never got our naan, nor did we get refills of drinks at any point (come on, Indian food is spicy!).    With all of the awesome Indian restaurants in the Oakland area, I'd say give this one a pass and keep walking down Craig Street until you see Tamarind!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Yuva for dinner on Craig randomly when trying to decide on a place to eat with friends. I got the chicken korma and it was very flavorful (albeit a tad salty for my taste) and creamy. To be honest, it is a little overpriced but there is a student discount at select times from M-Th (just show student ID). But all in all, the food is certainly not bad at all and the waiters are very kind. Also, don't be afraid to make your food a little spicier--I got medium spice and didn't feel a thing!"}
{"text":"Below average food, terrible customer service.  Lady at the counter is rude for no reason, we saw here fighting with two customers during the time we where there.   Also they dont like to take Yelp voucher, and made it seem like they did us a favor by accepting the voucher!!!   Never going back again."}
{"text":"We stopped in around when they first opened up after replacing Star of India.   Love the updated decor, makes the place a lot brighter and more welcoming. Props to new management for that.   We ordered our usual few dishes we always order at Indian restaurants. Nothing was out of the ordinary, the garlic naan was really good though. Tasty, but small-ish portions. Biggest gripe is the price. In my opinion, the food tastes similar to Star of India, but it was significantly higher priced. For what? the upscale decor? Meh. 2 samosas for like $5.. why??? (Go get super cheap samosas across the street instead)  Waiter was super attentive though, water glass never went past the middle, and we were asked multiple times of how we were doing/how the food is.   All in all, I really can't justify the price for the food."}
{"text":"Definitely an upgrade from Star of India. The lunch specials are decent. A bit pricey, but not unbearable.   An easy quick lunch if you go to CMU and are craving Indian food."}
{"text":"Just left a tip last time instead of a review. I love their customer service very much. They are very polite, always smiling and treat each customer very well. Really nice food. Best this is their Tawa chapati. Better than homemade! this is my second favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh (after Gaucho). Visit this place, will be worth going."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch and I have to say I prefer it over the multitude of Indian Buffet places in Oakland. Food is fresh, flavorful, and well portioned. Their lunch menu has a great variety without being intimidating for some one with little to no familiarity with Indian food. Staff are very polite and food comes quickly. A a great lunch place on Craig St!"}
{"text":"Probably the most expensive Indian restaurant in the US. Highly expensive considering the amount of food served. Their chicken biriyani costs $14 and I found only 2 pieces of chicken. The whole biriyani served in a small bowl. I have tried several Indian places, but this one is the most expensive one."}
{"text":"I recently ate at Yuva India in Oakland. The food is fantastic the flavors are authentic and the breads are link none that I've had in Pittsburgh.  Yuva is one of only two places that brings the pori bread out steaming hot and still puffed up.  All of the dishes I've had at Yuva on different occasions have always come out of the kitchen hot and beautifully prepared. If you like Indian you have to try their food its sooo not like the already prepared packaged Indian food that a lot of places serve."}
{"text":"1. Over priced Bland food with no flavor and horrible service. We paid $130 for 6 people? Seriously?  2. Understaffed restaurant  3. Went there with family and every person in the table had a bad experience  4. Finished dinner over 2 hours since there were 5 breaks in between figuring out the CORRECT order, given us cooked naan versus doughy raw ones, onion salad on the side came after we finished half our meal, we got chicken tikka masala instead of paneer and after specifically stating we are vegetarian. Each one of us had to get up to compensate for the staff to get napkins, plates, refills.... 5. If anything Mr Navin should be present on weekends to witness the debacle of a restaurant first hand and take some onus. Start with refunding our money ...."}
{"text":"Yummy (SPICY) food, great atmosphere, pretty bad service the night I was there (around 7pm). There was one bus boy, one waiter, and I think the owner was also working. There were quite a large amount of people in there! I was with a medium sized group, 6 people. We got our food pretty quickly, but after that, we were left alone dying of thirst! Haha, the food is really spicy, and we were so thirsty but we couldn't flag the waiter down. He was preoccupied cleaning glasses or serving other customers. I think they were probably understaffed. It took us forever to get the check, get our food boxed, and leave. The food was good though, and decently priced!"}
{"text":"The food was subpar and wasn't special compared to other Indian restaurants I've eaten at.  Service was awful. We waited 30 minutes before they took our order. They had four people working that night with only a few tables, and all they did was stand around cleaning silverware and cups. They only filled up our waters once they heard one of us complain. They were not coordinated at all as when one person brought us plates, another removed them only to bring us different plates.  One of our orders were also messed up. We ordered butter chicken and received shrimp in some sauce. They said it was definitely chicken, but we could tell that it was most indeed shrimp. Lastly, I saw that they offered a 10% discount upon check in on yelp, but they denied it because, \"there's no button for it\". Was really not what I was expecting at all."}
{"text":"I can't believe I am looking at a 3 star rating. I have not went there once and been disappointed. Their korma and Maha Yuva AND mango drink was out of this world.   I really don't have much else to say to make this review help worthy. The waiters were nice. The environment was clean and nice. Yelp wants me to write more. I guess parking is a pain. Do they deserve to lose a star because of parking? I don't think so. If they were not so good, I'd take a star. In my opinion, Yuva India was so good, I would actually consider wrestling with that Pittsburgh auto, pedestrian, and bicycle traffic AND drive around for an hour to find a place to park.   Me and my family really enjoy going to Yuva India. Maybe we are not  as experienced with Indian food as those giving the low star reviews. I should read and find out what the problem is (other than things out of their control like where to put your car). It would be an absolute dream come true if an Indian place this nice would open up in my area."}
{"text":"I've been going to the star of india for years, so I was eager to try this new indian restaurant which just opened up in it's place.  Yuva did not disappoint.  The staff was knowledgeable and friendly.  Yuva had new, massive photographs of Indian spices decorating the walls.  They had a huge selection, and everything was delicious and homemade.  My only complaint was the price for the small entree portions did not seem like a good value to me.  The $16+ entree portions were just small bowls.  They were very tasty, but I expected more.  That said, the appetizer sampler and naan bread sampler were very reasonably priced and generous.  To get a good value I'd skip the entrees entirely and stick purely to the appetizers and sides, doing that I would gladly come back to Yuva again!"}
{"text":"Just a heads up if you're calling to order take out their actual menu is different than what's listed on line. Their samosas are pretty good, I also had their Chole (Chana masala) and it good, not the best I've ever had but flavorful and well done. Their tamarind sauce was a little bit sweeter than I'm used to but it was still very yummy!"}
{"text":"A little pricey for what you get but overall good quality! I love the layout of the restaurant but he wait staff didn't explain much on the menu"}
{"text":"According to me, the food is expensive for the quality and quantity they offer. I was here couple of times and both the times, I left with the feeling that I paid too much for what I had eaten. I felt the quantity is so less that I ended up having a second dinner.   I would still have gone back if the taste was good, however, in my opinion, they tone down the flavours way too much and it is no longer authentic Indian food."}
