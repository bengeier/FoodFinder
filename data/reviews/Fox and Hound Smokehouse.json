{"text":"Very disappointed with this establishment. This was my favorite place to eat. I took my family to eat here almost on a weekly basis. One day we walk in and every table was turned into a high top table. I am a disabled veteran in a wheelchair. They tried to accommodate me by lowering the table, but it popped up and hit me on the chin. This incident happened a little while ago, but in a recent conversation, this subject came up and I decided to write a review. I'm hoping to raise awareness and reach out to see if this restaurant will change their accommodations and possibly make it easier for disabled people to enjoy."}
{"text":"I was a frequent diner for many years until I went to this location.  The service is horrible.   The bartender gave me a dirty look and appeared to be  annoyed that I wanted to order food.   The next time I went a different bartender didn't even acknowledge I was there.  One time is forgivable; but twice?  I will not be spending any money there.  This appears to be the trend in this restaurant decent food and deplorable service."}
{"text":"I was a regular here for 5 years loved this place I would go here 4 times a week. My wife fell in love with the food and atmosphere. I'm not sure what has happened with management or staff but we were not treated when we came in, about 15 customers for Monday night football majority of the people were either playing pool or at the bar. We sat at a table after asking someone whole told us to sit wherever we like. After that not a single staff member approached us for 20 minutes that's when I decided it was time for the 3 of us to leave. Sad part is everyone was looking through menus and drink menus we were finally out of the house because we got a baby sitter. This place has really went down hill drunk people out front arguing, little kid running around out of control and not a single employee to take an order not even at the bar. Don't waste your time going here I know I won't make that mistake again. If I could give zero stars I would!"}
