{"text":"Love the sonic blast. Doesnt matter which sonic blast you pick they all taste awesome. The slushes are awesome. Very cheap too $1.08. But the only problem is that with the slush is that it dries up after your done drinking it so it becomes all white."}
{"text":"A place that serves shakes should have fatter straws, of course that won't help trying to get a 1 to 1-1/2\" chunk of banana up it. A spoon would have been nice, too.  Also ordered the chicken dinner but did not get t he gravy or any other sauces. Total disappointment. Not going back here."}
{"text":"Fast food eater beware, this sonic gave me terrible food poisoning which landed me in the ER. Be careful when eating here,  and save part of your food for testing otherwise they won't believe you. Short and simple don't eat here."}
{"text":"Love sonic usually go there a few times a week, however today my experience was less than pleasant they made my drink wrong and then replaced it with the drink I actually ordered but it was only 3/4 full with the nerd candy just dropped right on top not mixed in or anything. And the other slushi I ordered doesn't even barely have flavor.. Sad cuz I go here all the time but this is the second time I have had a problem with them. On the other occasion I ordered the sonic burger and it had no flavor to the meat the bread was soggy and it was all burnt and smooshed and tasted terrible but now something has happened twice so I guess I will be avoiding sonic for awhile"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this sonic burger location for a few years now.  Being that im living in hawaii we dont have a sonic out here.  I always get a conney and a cherry lime aid .  Lately ive been getting the blueberry slush with nerds.  Awesome fast and accurate service."}
{"text":"Live around the area and clearly there still is not enough restaurants around laveen so sonic is one of my family's option for a quick drink or snack. I just have to say the drive thru is the worst! Who ever handles the drive thru must turn off their headset because I had to wait at least  5mins yelling at the speaker so someone will answer me and this has happened a couple times. So I had to drive up and tell one of the workers that I been waiting for someone to take my order. It actually happened again tonight but only to the car in front of me and as soon as she drove off (pissed off) they took my ordered right away. I wish they would hire an older group because clearly these young kids are not doing the job. This sonic should be on point considering it's the only sonic in laveen. My only question: where is the manager????"}
{"text":"Upon second visit, service was much better!  It looks like they are making improvements.  Manager was able to make an exception and honor two coupons for me on different menu items."}
{"text":"Has gone downhill since last in the area. Food on floor. Trash cans over filled. Food was lukewarm. Just sloppy overall."}
{"text":"Their shakes taste like expired blue cheese I asked for a strawberry cheesecake shake and it tasted exactly like blue cheese I wanted to run over there and throw the shake at their window but my boyfriend insisted to just drink the blue cheese shake"}
{"text":"Friday nights are Sonic Sunday nights .. I have never had a problem until tonight when we ordered our 3 Sundays and got home and had to clean my car.. They not only didn't put the tops on all the way but it was melted like it had either been sitting on the counter for someone to order it or their ice cream machine was broken. It went everywhere .. I am not a happy camper !!"}
{"text":"Went to sonic tonight for diner. All the previous reviews for this place no longer apply. I thought it was great, I've had sonic in Texas and Washington and this one was better than both. We'll be back for more. Btw.. get the shakes, they really are good."}
{"text":"Great sonic restaurant. Tots are always hot(biggest complaint about sonic)  and the customer service is the bees knees"}
{"text":"Sorry... drive-thru service is way too slow when there doesn't look like there's any business at all.. the speaker wasn't working so we had to the window to order & wait for the food... could've offered free small drinks for the inconvenience... we could have driven away thinking they weren't open. Haven't back since..."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  I arrived at 8:05 am to order food. It didn't arrive for ten minutes, then the cc system went down. I have been waiting over 15 minutes for my cc to get it back. It is 8:30 and still waiting for cc back. I am now late for a meeting."}
{"text":"I am completely dismayed by the ineptitude of the service here. A simple order of a chicken club (which includes bacon), tots and a drink plus....a side of bacon for my dog, ends up as a sandwich with no bacon because the food preparer is not smart enough to figure this out. If this had happened just once I would have just brushed it off as an honest mistake. But it has happened numerous times, despite explaining the problem to the person manning the drive-thru window."}
{"text":"First of all the people were not friendly at all. Second I found a MOLDY jalapeño in my sandwich. SO GROSS"}
{"text":"The ONION RINGS we were served were SOUR!!! The MANAGER who took my order \"managed\" to Screw up my order. Then the carhop brought my change back covered in spit. Every time we go to this location they add something to our order! TERRIBLE LOCATION that should be SHUT DOWN."}
{"text":"this sonic drive in was only a 3 star.  well it was just a regular day, at sonic. but i started noticing that everytime we go there., the service gets worst and worst . now it is so slow. i am just saying the service is horrible but the food delicious! this is a wonderful fast food chain and i love i, and the half price cheese burger is the best! if you have the time then of course, you can wait for a half and hour. good luck on your next trip to this sonic"}
{"text":"We are never going back to this location again. Several times we have ordered and waited 20 minutes for two drinks, fountain drinks! And they always get the order wrong. Bad service."}
{"text":"Last night around 8pm ( 7/20/17 ) I picked up a New York Dog, a Chicago Dog and a medium fry from the Drive-Thru ( Cheyenne). They tasted great but later at 3am they were not that great. I woke up with painful stomach cramps, excessive gas and continuous  liquid bowel movements. By 6am the worse was over and I was able to get back to sleep without soiling my bed. Throughout this ordeal the stench of rancid opinions was overwhelming ( New York Dog ) which reminded me of how tart the sauerkraut was that also accompanied the NY Dog. 
Was it the opinions, was it the sauerkraut? Who knows, maybe it was both!!!"}
{"text":"The food is alright, and the customer service is fair. I had an issue with a few orders but they did make it right. The drinks seem watered down, and the carbonation isn't the best. I do like how I can customize just about anything, including food."}
{"text":"Me and my Mom ,was getting and oil change at Cj Auto Repair  yesterday and we decided to go to Sonic , Great customer service we order two strawberry sundaes and it was a very reasonable price and taste great"}
{"text":"this is the least favorite sonic location I've visited and the only one that has had repeated problems that haven't been corrected. recently I ordered a standard cheeseburger combo with a slush. 20 minutes later, I got it. the bun was partially frozen like it came straight from the freezer and the patty was lukewarm, at best. overall disappointed at this sonic."}
{"text":"We come here all the time but lately they can't seem to get an order right!!! Why is it that I have to check my order both at the drive thru, the window and when it gets to my car it's still wrong!?!  Why do you bother confirming my order if you are just going to give me whatever you want at the window? It's like playing Russian roulette!!! Totally disappointed."}
{"text":"I have had so many problems at this specific Sonic. All I got was a vanilla coke, and when I drove home I learned it was Dr. Pepper. I went back and when I did they gave me major attitude, and made it seem as if it was my fault. When I tried my drink for the second time, it was Dr. Pepper again.  I refuse to go back."}
{"text":"Took the family here for the first time last weekend. First time at any Sonic, and was expecting a typical fast food experience.  What's this?  I order while parked in my car, and a girl on roller blades brings the food out to me?  Cool!  Instead of fries, I can get tater tots?  Double cool!!  And that burger on Texas toast was great.  Definitely going back.  Previous reviews mention happy hour.  Apparently they are famous for the drinks, which I will need to try."}
{"text":"love the lil doggies! I think it's refreshing to have that instead of the usual Hot dogs. Also the toaster is so much better than having a bun for your burgers. Not to mention all of their beverage choices are awesome, the hardest part is choosing a flavor. Love the servers coming out on roller skates, very 1950's lol."}
{"text":"I waited 30 min for two Oreo blasts. They weren't even made correctly so I left mine on the table. Wish I would have just got my money back. Never going back"}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars because of Kaden. It was almost midnight when I got there and he was the most respectful employee. He was rushing around getting things taken care of and had an amazing attitude. Hope he gets moved up."}
{"text":"I hope corporate notices all of these crap reviews. Stopped by this sonic tonight for the first time and it was ridiculous. After placing my order in the drive up parking, we waited roughly 20 minutes for chicken strips, a sundae and 2 blasts. We were informed they were out of hot fudge. Sonic is known for ice cream and sundaes. Why would you let your store run out of a staple? When our order came out, my sundae was missing nuts. The only thing I asked for besides fudge. Employee took it back and sprinkled on some peanuts, fine. But when I got home my brownie and waffle blast was made with the berry ice cream when I had specified vanilla. Even if your order was correct on the screen, inspect everything before leaving because the people here obviously pay no mind to it. Awful."}
{"text":"I guess my review is the same as the others.  Completely wrong order, missing food. 

The manager first said she would fix the order by having me pay the difference for the wrong items. So don't put the receipt in the bag and/or review the order.

I had to wait for the someone to even acknowledge me standing and pushing the button I found it odd that I would have to pay more for cold food.  I suggested to the manager she take back the wrong items and give me the items I ordered. She agreed to  that but I open the chicken sandwich and it is burnt. I did not want any additional food from this place. 

The manager continued to play the victim because I just had enough and wanted to leave.  Like she was trying to fix things but I had to suggest the right thing to do she only wanted more money for her staffs mistakes."}
{"text":"Now, I will warn you and say that I have yet to experience every menu item this Sonic has to offer, but I CAN tell you that their route 44 oz diet vanilla cokes are the best I have ever had. I have also had a shake and the cinna stacks. The shake was blegh and not super worth it, but the cinnastacks were ah-may-zing. So, so good. Salivating over here, people. Don't make my same mistake and find the cream cheese frosting after eating all the cinnastacks.... my one complaint: they put the frosting at the bottom of the bag. 

Be sure to go between 2 and 4 and you get 1/2 off your drinks, but I s-w-e-a-r that they take off more than that. 5 stars forever! Also, you don't lose the consistency with this franchise--- the location is as sketchy as ever and certainly adds to the drive-in charm!"}
{"text":"Ordered the cookie dough shake but quickly found out it's made with cookie dough flavored syrup, not actual cookie dough. Absolutely disgusting. If 0 stars was an option that's what I would give it."}
{"text":"My friend works here. She only get's paid 4.25 an hour, waitress wage. so tipppp! =] I am not a fan of fast food, but the dessert is awesome!! Try the cream slushes!!!"}
{"text":"Service was very good and food came out really fast.  Will definitely come back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. Went with my girl to get some food because we were starving and we waited at the drive in for about 20 minutes clicking the button over and over again and no one would attend us so we decided to go through the drive through and It took someone 5 minutes to attend us and while we were ordering the person taking our order wasn't responding and we sat there for another 3-5 minutes so er decided to leave. You guys need to work on your customer service. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Since when does it take 15 min to get a slushie & cheese sticks at a drive through? And then get the WRONG ORDER! Jeesh, hire some decent help, please instead of leaving an entire restaurant  to teens to run!"}
{"text":"I don't particularly like eating in my car and I didn't even know Sonic had any \"eat in\" restaurants, so I was pleasantly surprised when I happened upon this location.  The ordering via phone was unique and the service was quick and friendly.  It almost felt like I was eating at a full-service restaurant by the way every worker that passed asked if everything was all right and if they could get us anything else.  The restaurant was also well-kept.  I try not to make it a habit to eat footlong chili dogs and tator tots, but when I get a craving, this is a great spot to get them!"}
{"text":"This Sonic has just about the worst employees I've ever heard/seen in my life. I've come in multiple times late night and was denied service because the only person working was \"I'm on a break\". And now I come in at an earlier hour and the person taking my order literally sounded like she hated me when she was taking my order,  like I was the last thing she wanted to deal with right now. I almost wanted to tell her off over the speaker about how rude she was being but held it in. I am never coming back here. Ever. (I am a former sonic car hop and I can attest to how bad this location is. The management should be ashamed of themselves.)"}
{"text":"Lol i swear this sonic is the wierdest one cause it seems like there not consistent with there hours idk there just open at wierd times anyway the food was pretty good, as hood a sonic can be lol the customer service was decent the kid looked like he was high but its all good he was really funny so i didnt trip to much idk when ill be back here"}
{"text":"Awesome orange creme slush! Happy servers - very patient with our large order. Great Spring Break stop ;) don't forget to tip!"}
{"text":"I love Sonic but this location never gets it right and they take too long. I am not exaggerating. They either can't get special orders right, orders are short, take too long, or all of the above. I usually get suckered to go back once a year thinking they'll  improve but no more. Last time I went, I ordered a cherry limeade and after waiting over 5 min on the drive thru, I left. They weren't busy or anything. Again, I love Sonic but this location is simply awful. They have serious process and quality control issues that have persisted since they first opened."}
{"text":"open till 12 yet it was closed when I got there at 1030, you guys might want to take your banner off?"}
{"text":"So I always try to eat healthy. However when I do cheat I love burgers. one of my favorite places to go is Sonic burgers. it is so greasy and so fattening but so satisfying. If you are in the mood for a good burger at a great price then you should really eat at Sonic. not to mention that the fries are also amazing. now I have to go to the gym and work off does double cheeseburger and french fries."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, it took nearly 10 minutes while parked at their outside ordering stalls to get someone to respond. Then the young woman on the intercom insisted that the $5.99 Deluxe Chicken Sandwich on their menu didn't exist, and that we had to order the $6.99 Ultimate Chick Club. 

After a few minutes explaining the $5.99 item was right there on the menu, we ended up going inside. 

Manager Michelle told us with a smug smile the menu was wrong when we pointed out that it clearly has the $5.99 Deluxe Chicken Sandwich right on both the inside and outside menus. 

We ended up leaving, because it really wasn't worth the wait that it took to get someone to respond outside and the bad behavior on the inside."}
{"text":"Food is great but never fails, every time we go they always mess up our order, gives us someone else's order or forgets to give us something with our order"}
{"text":"The woman who took our order was so rude. After ordering on the intercom there was a long period of silence so we said hello just to make sure someone was still there and the woman responded with an irritated attitude and said ya I'm putting your order in okay?! It was extremely rude and uncalled for. Ridiculous excuse for customer service."}
{"text":"KC should get a rase.  He is a great employee, hard working unlike most people. Good food and made my night..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food here but it literally takes FOREVER to receive. This is the second time I've sat in the drive-through for 15 + minutes. Really sucks"}
{"text":"I would give this place negative stars if possible. It almost makes me think that the previous comments are false. I hate to say I've been to this location more than once. It's literally right around the corner from me and yes the happy hour is what makes me want to go back but the service is the worst I've ever seen. Almost as worst as McDonald's on 99n lower buckeye. I will drive to Van Buren to get my drink instead of going 60 yards to this location. I can't be the only person that thinks this."}
{"text":"ATTN MANAGEMENT: The worker who took our order was pushy and rude!!! love the food and drinks, but the service was less than impressive."}
{"text":"They never get my order wrong, although every once in a while they will put extra food I didn't ask for into my box :) Always love free stuff. Excellent chicken, coneys, slushes, and extra-thick malts just like I like 'em. What needs to be hot is hot, and what needs to be cold is cold. Fast service and they always double-check my order at the window. Very polite."}
{"text":"Horrible place. Terrible food and even worst service! Everyone stands around and talks, no effort to wait on customers! Place is filthy, sticky tables, overflowing trash cans. If you go thru the drive thru, better plan on waiting a long, long, long, long time - like at least an hour. Just to get to the window, then another 20 minutes to get your order, which will be Cold and most likely Wrong!"}
{"text":"Good change from the norm of pure fast food with a classic drive in feel. But when asked to wait it seams like it's about 20-30 minutes and that's not full or over busy. Been here a lot but this is buy far is the longest I've ever had to wait for fast food."}
{"text":"Normally my experience at Sonic is pretty bland and not memorable at all. Tonight took a new low. After ordering I sat staring at the drive thru window with the lady who took my order no where in sight. After 5 minutes of being ignored Tisha finally uttered the price I had to pay and nothing else. HORRIBLE SERVICE! You are in the customer service industry, learn how to greet or at least acknowledge your customers. Never coming back to this Sonic even if it is close to my house, not worth it."}
{"text":"F__king idiots! Order master blast desserts and the bottom of the cups are messed up so instead of them putting them in new cups they put a stupid sticker on the bottom thinking it'll hold and keep it from leaking. Leaked in my cup holders on the way home then find a mess on my table were a couple of the cups set. Never again"}
{"text":"I've only had one bad experience here among the multiple times I've patronized this establishment. The bad experience turned worse after I submitted an online complaint and the manager left a sarcastic voicemail in response to my online complaint. Boooo! If my order and service wasn't so bad during that visit I wouldn't have had a reason to complain!"}
{"text":"They take forever to get the food out, thats if they get it right... It's ran by a bunch of high school kids that don't know what they are doing.. I would give this place zero stars if I could. Drive thru is a joke"}
{"text":"Only gets a 1 because cant give it a zero.  Received text for $1 chili cheese dog and all American dog promotion.  Orders 4 chili cheese then tried to order All American dog without relish of ketchup for my 5 year old. Would not allow all American dog to be ordered plain.....if I wanted to delete ketchup and relish they wanted to charge me 2 dollars.  Ridiculous.
Cancelled entire order and left"}
{"text":"Worst place. I just waited 15 mins for a breakfast burrito at 7 am in the morning. There was no one there the whole time. Disappointed. Plus the screen said our food was being delivered for like half of that time so how long did my food just sit there for no reason? I'm in a hurry people but they don't care. Service was rude as could be as well."}
{"text":"If you're from the Chicago area, you'll be glad to finally see a Sonic and not just see the commercial for it!  I just HAD to go when I moved here, and it's so worth it.  I haven't tried any food, but the slushes are the best because they're so fresh AND refreshing.  They put whole chunks of fruit in them (what fast food place does that?), and if you go between 2-4PM any day, the drinks are all half off.  Drive-thru and drink up!"}
{"text":"Great location. Newly opened. Parking lot should be re-surfaced for the skater's safety. Service was good for a very busy, recently opened Sonic. Food was as expected."}
{"text":"Went there to get some grub but our drinks tasted as though it had soap in it, the fries were burnt, the grilled cheese had stale bread, and the milkshake tasted as though they made it with expired rotten milk i wouldnt recommend goin there ever again."}
{"text":"The food arrived and it was nice and hot. Our order was correct and the service was great. I was worried when we drove up and saw a baseball team ahead of us, but there were no issues."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow. I visit once a week and have never sat in the drive thru less than 10 minutes. Usually there is only one car in front of me so I don't understand why the service is sooo slow."}
{"text":"So from the start this sonic was ughh. When we ordered the person who spoke to my boyfriend and I, didn't know anything that was going on. We ask what happy hour it was and it took him 5 mins to just tell us it was the 1/2 off milk shake happy hour. As we ordered one chili cheese dog he ask if we'd like ketchup, mayo, and mustard on our order and we said no to all, but we did ask to add onions on it, and also on another order (extreme tots) not to add chili. After he asked if everything looked right on the screen we saw it still said ketch up, mayo, and mustard. So we had to tell him again to please take it off. When we got our food it had no ketch up mayo or mustard like we asked but it didn't have onions on it. Also the order we asked for with no chili was covered with chili. So we let them know. Although it was good customer service, we had to wait 10 mins for them to bring back the same hotdog and a different tots without chili. And the hot dog tasted like crap according to my boyfriend and the on top of that  the cheese in my tots was all nasty and hard and not shredded. So I don't recommend this sonic."}
{"text":"Is this the Sonic's that I visited? I can't exactly remember since I saw more Sonic Drive-Ins in 3 days than I have my entire life in California, and since I am one of those fortunate enough to be teased by Sonic commercials constantly repeated on cable television, I had to try this place (similar to my situation in Cleveland with White Castle burgers, but in that instance I did not have the appetite for tiny burgers and totally regret my decision to keep on driving). I was utterly surprised with Sonic's and was left wanting more. I only had a cranberry slush, but the consistency was the same throughout my drink (regular ICEE's will become more icy with less concentrated syrup flavoring) and the tiny ice particles added to the refreshing factor. Being in 110+ heat made me crave for a constant supply of Sonic slushes.....damn them for making such a great drink. 

I need a Sonic's near the Bay Area......if you're going to advertise in my area, please deliver Sonic's corporation!"}
{"text":"Worst location ever!! I love Sonic and I love their food but this location was terrible. I ordered a flavored iced tea which is already pricey. It was 75 percent ice. My husband got a soda that had also contained that much ice. We asked for refills and the manager informed us that we would have to pay for them. We told him that it was mostly ice to begin with and he still insisted he had to charge us. That is crap. If I did not even get the drink I originally paid for why should I pay even more to get it??!!! I have not been charged at other locations and I have never been given a drink with so much ice either. I was so disappointed that I almost did not want to go to any Sonic location again. Get rid of that manager and replace him with someone who is familiar with the phrase customer service, especially when he failed to provide a quality product in the first place. SONIC IS GREAT, JUST NOT THIS LOCATION. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Incompetent staff. Incompetent management. By far, the worst service I have ever received. Unless you want to wait 45 minutes for a bland \"burger,\" avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"If there was no stars or a negative star I would have picked that option!!  This location had the WORST service I have ever had!!   I was there with 4 other people, I was double charged for my order, I was told I will get a refund but not for 2-3 days.  The others had all been given the wrong orders, when given back they did not bring out the correct orders, we had to ask several times to get our food.   We were there for over 20 minutes trying to get this straightened out."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service! I went to the drive-thru and ordered two kids meal and tater tots thinking it will be fast. I paid for my order, got my change and drinks. They did not inform me that my order will take a while. I could've cancelled the order if I had known. I finally knocked on the drive-thru window when I heard employees talking and laughing amongst themselves. It took 12 minutes from the time I paid for someone to tell me that they're waiting for tater tots. Only because I tried to get their attention by knocked on the window. After my complaint, the order arrives in last than 1 minute. Will not come back at this loncation anymore!D"}
{"text":"Food is terrible, complete lack of flavor. Didn't even get cherries in my cherry limeade!"}
{"text":"I don't typically eat here but my wife likes the slushies they offer."}
{"text":"This Sonic Drive-In is ok.  I think it is more the idea of what drive-ins used to be why one goes to a Sonic. I have only heard and seen what a drive-in used to be like on documentaries and some movies. 

The food here is what it is for what you pay for it. You do not go here expecting anything great  tasting as you just will not get it. After all this is fast food. The carhops do not use skates. Saving this location from a lower score is the friendly service received."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Waited for over 10 minutes and never got attended."}
{"text":"Brutal experience, sketchy area. Tasteless food, one of the worst burger experiences of my life, this franchise needs new mgmt."}
{"text":"So last night I had the major munchies and I went to sonics wasn't good at all... my onion rings where cold, I asked for a well done grilled cheese and I got a wet cheese sandwich .. the car hop was very nice but other then her being nice the food sucked very gross"}
{"text":"Truth be told, I don't care for Sonic. I did discover the pickle -Os recently and I can't get enough. That is not the point of my review though. I believe a certain employee deserves recognition.  I just did a survey based on Diamond. I'm just going to paste what I said: 

I never do surveys, the only reason I am is because after a long day , diamond is just the sweetest person to encounter. She has the most friendly smile and wave. She explained the pickles will be made fresh if I'd like to wait, and offered a drink during my wait on this hot day. It's the way she offers though. Very few people are as genuine as you can tell diamond is. Give this girl a raise and recognition.. she is an absolute gem. She is the epitome of perfect customer service!!

Keep it up girl. The world needs more people that shine , just like you."}
{"text":"It was always a pleasure getting the happy hour half off shakes, but not last night. My sister and I went to this store to buy shakes last night. After 3 hours of consuming those said shakes, we both had gotten food poisoning. I was awake all night long, but my sister who ordered a small sized shake, felt a bit better than i was. I'm going to contact the Corporate about this."}
{"text":"The only thing I go for is the giant, delicious, real fruit slushies. They are unbelievable. However their food is ok at best and more expensive than other fast food. 

Sonic is incredibly slow and incompetent. I've never had more problems with a drive thru in my life. I handed her my card and some coupons that the girl apparently didn't use until I pointed it out multiple times that the price was too high. The next day I realized I had some how paid twice? I called and they did nothing but deny and offer me a dollar burger. Thanks for nothing sonic."}
{"text":"Same story really, just a different business: messed up order, didn't even bag everything. Went back to get what I ordered & missing items and they STILL got it wrong. Jennifer the GM was extremely nice & gave me extra coupons & freebies but it didn't really make up for the huge inconvenience their failure to get it right the first time caused. Even though my office is down the street & I love Sonic...won't be back to this location. Which btw, is not \"off strip.\"  That gives the false impression it is near. This location is on Flamingo on the west side of I-15 across from Palms."}
{"text":"Service varies from time to time they never get my order wrong, but sometimes the wait is a little long. Also they aren't too great when it comes to giving you your receipt, I always have to ask for it when I use the drive thru. But other than that this is a good location."}
{"text":"Very slow service at the drive thru. Car in front of me abandoned their order and left. 20 minute wait for 3 milkshakes."}
{"text":"THE BEST ONION RINGS EVER IN THE WORLD!!!!!  There's no need to say anything more."}
{"text":"This sonic is unlike any others I've been 2. U can go in and order through a telephone built in ur booth. Pretty sweet huh?"}
{"text":"I go here at least twice a week.  Great high quality food for a fast food place.  I have had awesome service every time I go.  The drive thru person always repeats my order and it is always correct when I get it.  The roller skate person has always been very friendly.  Drive thru does get busy but this is a busy location.  Really enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"3rd Time gone on my lunch time always forgets to give me F Ranch and Ketchup, wait time 15min, on top of that the lady thats deliver the food, plays the little game , oh you want your change shit,,,"}
{"text":"It's fast food, how high can your expectations be?!  

You know exactly what you are getting when you pull into a drive thru.  

Every time I have been here, I'm happy.  I'm not a huge fast food eater but sometimes a bacon burger and some tater tots can really hit the spot. 

Sonic has the best ice.  Did you know you can buy it in a bag??  So good!  I love love love the Strawberry Slush.  The amazing ice is crushed up even more and there are bits of fresh strawberry in this sugary drink that is sooo good.  Yummy."}
{"text":"To the Sonic Corporation, I just want to let you know how well this specific chain is NOT doing. I ordered my drink from the girl at the windows and she was nothing but absolutely rude to my child and myself.  Then when asking for the hamburger without the bun for my daughter she little laughed, and it made my 6-year-old ask why she laughed at her. 
My daughter's hamburger patty was thrown into the side of a corn dog bag with mustard all over the inside of the bag. She was not even able to pull it out. It was literally tilted sideways and there's mustard all over the bottom of her white uniform $28 School shirt now because of carelessness. 
I got my real fruit slushies and the top popped off immediately and the fruit just came right out in a blob and the rest of my drink is white. Am I missing good customer service? Sonic, typically, usually is good about their customer service. I will never ever go to a Sonic again.  
Now, not only is it a waste to go through your drive-thru and get the horrible customer. But now I wasted the $5.11 on the receipt and it's $28 uniform shirt for Dobson Academy. So I would strongly urge that nobody goes to 2935 South Dobson Road Mesa Arizona 85202. Obviously, you could tell that they don't give a care about their job.

*Update* I called corporate about this and they don't seem to care about resolving the issue as well. They did no follow-up. Waste of time and money!"}
{"text":"I don't know how you can go wrong with a cherry & lime slush,corn dog and chili cheese tots! Oh yeah, go during happy hour to get drinks half off.

In addition to happy hour (2-4pm) they run other specials but I never remember what or when they are. It's probably a good thing I don't, otherwise I'd probably be there everyday and double in size while simultaneously going broke on the breaded and fried delights.

I'm not a fan of using sprite zero in the limeades. No doubt they would put regular sprite in it if I asked but when I ordered one without noticing they switched it my taste buds were not happy with the surprise."}
{"text":"The food's OK (corn dogs, tater-tots, chili cheese coney), but where they really shine is in the drink department - the most important in the Valley of the Sun.

My favorites are:

cherry lime slush, strawberry limeade, ocean water and blue coconut slush (same as the ocean water, just in slush form).

If you go during happy hour (2-4) you can get half price drinks! What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Well, this Sonic sure doesn't meet the standards to any Sonic I have been to in the past.

First thing- the parking lot, yes I get this is a drive-in, but this is also Wisconsin, there is very little parking for guests who choose to dine inside, the dirve-in area is also rather small for the area; many customers are Sun Priarie/Madison based which is a very large amount of people.

Second- I chose to dine inside seeing as its December; this is a new building, however, it already feels disorganized, cluttered, and a bit dirty.  I noticed that it has a capacity of 40 people.... pretty shifty as it is located near many large business if a group of coworkers wanted to grab a quite lunch together, I really doubt this is where they'd want to be.  

Third- Service. I think I could have served the customers better.  I noticed one customer go back to the counter three times in the mere 20 minutes I was there; her shake was wrong, she didn't get the condiments she had requested, and then once she recieved her shake, she wasn't given a spoon or a straw.... 

Another annoying point, I get that this is a fast food resturant, but do you hear the kid screaming in the corner because he spilt his soda right in front of the door to come in/out, and do you se his mother looking at you in a panic and trying to go between the counter to get your attention and try to quite her kid? Yea didn't think so because the servers were too busy messing up orders and neglected to notice that I know just had to hurdle over a puddle of soda... 

Last- Food.  I opted for a chicken stirp dinner, weighing the fact I figured that was more challenging to mess up.  Surprisingly, they managed to bring it out correctly. However, it comes with toast, wouldn't one think this toast would possibly be buttered or served with a side? Nope! Come out dry-as-a-bone, yuck! 

Overall; I suggest taking your business to the nearby Subway, Burrachos, or even Kwik Trip... yikes!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times, and never had anything but a great experience. I'm actually pretty surprised that there is so much negative reviewing going on here. Back when they were first opening, it was a little slow. But that's to be expected from a new restaurant, and since then I've only had good experiences. The food and customer service are great, they're working hard to get the kinks out, and I think this store has real potential."}
{"text":"I didnt give 5 stars because of food quality but because of consistent quality experiences. I almost always assisted by TJ, that young man is an asset to this company. He is ALWAYS polite and friendly. My order  is NEVER wrong when i get it.  So TJ thank you for not being the typical fast food employee and taking pride in your job and delivering excellent  customer service!"}
{"text":"Don't like the changes, nor their grounds 'team'. I usually went to Sonic once a month for the banana split. They've dropped it from the menu, so that will definitely effect my visit frequency. Though Sonic is usually a bit more expensive, it's food quality and construct has always been top top-notch. And their people are even better! 

Had a bad experience there last visit though. The grounds maintenance guy was in total-prick mode and dusted my car. I was in the stall and ordered before he started his job, so he should have avoided me or had the guts to ask me to move. It's very unusual for dusters to be cleaning a lot when business's are open, so I guess he was late starting. He apparently decided to disregard the ground maintenance 'rules' of avoiding people and occupied vehicles. My order still hadn't arrive so there I sit obviously waiting. That didn't stop him from approaching towards my car blowing away, and dusted me. It takes only one day of using a blower to know how to operate it and how to work a lot with vehicles to avoid dusting them, so he apparently didn't care.

I was not happy, but it happens. He looked at me looking at him, then turned and left to another part of the lot. But it wasn't over. He came back a few minutes later and tried a more narrow angle approach to get the stalls right adjacent to my stall and dusted me AGAIN. That is not accidental, that's don't-give-a-shit mode.

Not happy that I had to spend another 5 bucks for that meal to get my car cleaned afterward. I drove thru the drive up and reported the situation to the attendant and asked her to escalate it to the manager. Hopefully they will address that deliberate act to the firm who employs him. 

Signed,
No Bananas, and a Dirty Car Man"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience ever here !  
The girl that brought us our drink was so rude. And disrespectful because I told her that she  got our drinks wrong. And it was the manager that took our order wrong.  I'm never coming here again honestly!"}
{"text":"It's really a pain to go to this Sonic. The service is horrible. They just have the idc attitude. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Josh is clearly one of those people who hate their life working fast food. If you don't like it do something else and stop being a rude jerk. Your unhappiness with your place in life should never affect your interaction with customers."}
{"text":"Every time I go, I'm thinking it's going to be in and out in a relatively short time. Always mistaken, slowest lines you can imagine."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the food at Sonic.  I took my daughter to get a corn dog this afternoon.  When she opened the bag it was burnt to a crisp and all ripped open.  When I took it back the manager didn't even apologize."}
{"text":"I was dissapointed with their customer service. We waited in the drive through for at least 5 min before hey finally got to us. We were the only ones in line, but they were either too busy or understaffed to help. When we finally got our order placed, there was someone behind us. We were waiting for them to get our order out, but the lady came out and gave the car behind us their order first! They served the vehicle behind us first and we waited and extra 10 min past that to actually get our meal. There were only two of us and it wasn't a large order, but it took them way too long. Dissapointing, but at least the food was decent."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this sonic! I was there recently and after pushing the button and waiting about 3  minutes no one even said I will be right with you! I thought maybe the speaker was not working so I moved and sure enough I pushed the button and about 4 minutes later nothing! I left! I love sonic but I am so disappointed in this location!"}
{"text":"Just came by to get drinks you got a hot dog didn't realize it had onions on it and without any charge they remade me another one. pretty awesome great place"}
{"text":"This place is terrible... I have gone here about 4-5 times in the last 5 months, and every single time I have had to wait for 18 plus minutes. All but one of the times, I was the only person in the drive through line. If I wanted to wait that long, I would just get a to go box from a restaurant! I will never go here again."}
{"text":"I always stop here and get a chocolate shake when I'm in Vegas.  These guys have the best chocolate shakes around.  For $3 you can't get a better deal.  Chocolate is my favorite flavor.  I tried the pineapple the other day and let's just say, I will be sticking with the chocolate shakes from now on."}
{"text":"Best cheese sticks for the price! I love coming here for happy hour. Breakfast burritos are pretty good but the coffee selection needs a little help."}
{"text":"Anyone taking orders in food service industry take note:  If you will shut your mouth and actually listen, most people will tell you exactly what they want. When you interrupt a customer while they are talking, it only shows how rude and unprofessional you are. 

So I ordered a small mozzarella sticks and a rt44 1/2 sweet tea/lemonade, easy ice.  Was told to \"hang on\" between the two. My order was not repeated back to me.  If their lemonade was made with lemons it would surprise me. Had to call back in and told them I couldn't taste any lemonade at all and asked if I could just order a small lemonade. No problem they said. While waiting for my total, the lady brings out another rt44 and says \"try this\". What part of \"can I order a small lemonade\" is hard to understand? Still not right but tired of messing with them I took it and left. Easy ice doesn't mean no ice btw. Drink had funky flavor and the mozzarella sticks were barely even warm."}
{"text":"The only reason this sonic is getting 2 stars is for the car hops, (Raven, Richard, ect.)and 1 NIGHT MANAGER(Richard) *there are 2 managers with the same name. The DAYTIME MANAGER, needs an attitude adjustment.....see Dick show great customer service.....is what I would like to post. 
It is too bad that one bad apple ruins the whole batch. I will be calling the owner of this location, not sure if it will do any good, Dick just has a REAL BAD ATTITUDE. 
Hey DICK, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE MY ORDER GET A DIFFERENT JOB!!!! I HAVE BEEN COMING HERE FOR YEARS, I'LL BE COMING HERE FOR YEARS AFTER YOUR LONG GONE, PROBABLY WORKING AT DAIRY QUEEN!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 5 times through various parts of the day throughout the past year and I have been unable to receive any sort of \"cooked\" food from this location. Whether it is cold, pre-cooked chicken strips or an uncooked, partly frozen, butter soaked \"toaster,\" I have had nothing but gag inducing experiences at this location. I usually like Sonic and what their menu has to offer, but it sucks that this, horrible location is closest to my house. I wish there was a way to give negative stars, because this location deserves it, especially since I work graveyard and this is one of the few places open when I get off of work."}
{"text":"First of all when we ordered the girl (blonde with glasses) working didn't tell us the total for our food. We were the only ones in the drive through but they were rushing us the whole time. When we got to the window the girl didn't give us a receipt. Only gave us 2 straws for 3 drinks and didn't even give us the marinara dipping sauce for the mozzarella sticks. LAME. Plus she continued to rush to get us out when we continued to be the only people in line at 11:30 pm. Love sonic but don't want to deal with sass and not getting what I paid for."}
{"text":"The worst fast food burger ever. Meat has no flavor, seems undercooked. Sloppy presentation. Bread has no good taste. Oreo blast milkshake was the only redeeming part of my meal."}
{"text":"Cashier is rude as fuck. And gross as shit, wiping her nose with her sleeve while I'm ordering. I feel unclean as hell eating this shit right now."}
{"text":"Wow, when this store first opened it was great - hot, delicious food and quick -n- friendly service.  Now it appears that someone has figured out that you can make all the food needed for the entire business day at 11am and then keep it under the warming lamp until needed.  The staff is still really nice, but the food takes a staggering 5 minutes to bring out and then you're irritated that it's lukewarm at best and soggy and/or dried out.  I can only blame management for the decline.  Hey management, drive past the boarded up Arby's a mile to the east and check out your future."}
{"text":"No one loves Sonic more than I do and I was filled with utter excitement when I found out they were putting one in right by my work. Service seemed pretty nice until I noticed a hair in my tots. She said were pretty clean here and just gave me a blank stare. I didn't think asking for a new order of tots was a big issue but apparently it was to her. As I was eating my new order of tots my friend noticed another hair on one right before I put it in my mouth. Seriously?! Hair in two different orders of tots?! Well done Sonic! Your customer service is exquisite!"}
{"text":"Dear Sonic Drive-In, I appreciate:

1. You're open 24/7
2. You provide an All-Day menu
3. You taking my ordering from a menu board speaker without rushing me
4. Your staff delivering my food on rollerskates

Hubby had the NY and Chicago dog and liked it. 

I had the Super Sonic Cheeseburger. It was huge and hard to eat without getting messy. 

I also had a hot fudge sundae. Boy was it a big fudgey treat! 

Sonic, you got my vote for a tasty burger and yummy desserts!"}
{"text":"Love the limeade.  The new hot dogs taste great, and actually look like the pictures you see on the ads.  How often does that happen?"}
{"text":"I have lived in this neighborhood for years and come here often, however, twice I have come for breakfast and they have run out of large tortillas? Who does that?  I am so sad to have watched this place go downhill over the years and their prices go up."}
{"text":"We go to the sonic every once in awhile for lunch and breakfast. I had a few orders and I understand that it is frustrating but this is part of your job. The shift leader was incredible rude and angry with me. She did not say thank you or please. She threw the straws and spoons in our vehicle and was rolling her eyes the whole time. She did not care that she was being rude and did not apologize once. I understand that people have bad days but this is no way to treat a customer. What kind of example does that set for the people that work under her? We will not be back and we will be sure that everyone knows how rude this location is."}
{"text":"Great service and quality food, not that I haven't had sonic before but every time I go to this location the employees are always friendly."}
{"text":"Seriously just waited 20 minutes after placing my order in the drive through to get my 2 kids meals. I was first in line too."}
{"text":"Its a real shame.. this place used to be thriving with good service and good food. Now it takes a very long time to go thru drive thru even with a few in line. In addition, they consistently mess our order up. BEWARE OF BEING OVER CHARGED! It's happened to us on many occasions."}
{"text":"Ordered a Oreo blast. Was impressed as it was sprinkled with oreos on top with a good amount of whip. But first bite in I realized it was just hiding the fact I actually got a vanilla ice cream with specks of Oreo cookie. Horrible. Essentially paid 2 bucks for maybe 1 crushed up Oreo cookie.. could of bought a whole pack instead."}
{"text":"I never thought any fast food (outside of In N Out) would get more than 4 stars. Besides the fact that their food tastes like roadkill, I'm still amazed. Only in Phoenix."}
{"text":"It's sonics Sundays!!
Always cool to see servers with roller skates! And roller blades!!
Felt so old!!"}
{"text":"Okay, a Sonic is a Sonic, right?  Burgers, fries, shakes, etc. That's true here, but I'm sure you knew that going in. 

What I'm stumping for here is their new Premium Beef Hot Dogs. For fast food hot dogs, these dogs are pretty tasty noms. Seriously.

Let's discuss my favorite: The Chicago Dog.  Sure, they offer a New York Dog, a Baja Dog, and a couple others, but the Chicago Dog is totally the one to get.  It has the requisite mustard, relish, tomato, peppers, and pickle spear, but what really makes this thing worth buying is the amazing, soft, delectable poppy-seed bun.  Y. U. M.

Yes, I cannot say enough good things about this gluten-laden delight of a hot dog cradle, because it's so UNLIKE the normal fare you'd get at Sonic. Crushed, mushy buns are pretty much accepted across the lines of all burger joints, but when one of those joints gets a lowly hot dog bun nailed PERFECTLY, well, then that's something.  Add to that the decently delicious ingredients (beef dog, condiments), and it's a winner for me.

Yes, I know Ted's is kinda the hot dog king around here, but I gotta tell you, this Chicago dog is worth a try."}
{"text":"We just got home from this Sonic and we couldn't help but write a glowing review for our helper, Aaron. This dude had such a sweet disposition it made me wish that no evil or messed up customer would ever come his way. You could hear the purity of his soul right through the small Sonic speaker. In all seriousness, Aaron was so polite and so helpful. The kid really seemed to have a genuine heart and you could tell he really cared. We called  to check in because we thought our shake and sundae were taking a bit long, but he kindly let us know he was just finishing it up. The food came out great, so it must have been because he was putting the necessary time into making it right. Aaron is the real deal; he's going places."}
{"text":"I used to love bringing my grandkids here, but the service has been horrible this past year, I get texts with specials, order them, when I pull up, they have no idea what I'm talking about, I show them the text, and then the confusion gets worse, I was overcharged, I called the manager, he took my number, said he would call back... No call... They totally messed my order up another time, the manager offered me two free meals, took my name and told me to let them know when I ordered.... They once again said, they had no idea what I was talking about, gave up on that... Waited in the drive through for 22 minutes, I would have left, but couldn't get out... Tried one more time when they had a special on breakfast burritos... Once again, no idea what I was talking about, showed them the text, but had to pay full price because they didn't know how to ring them up...I still go sometimes because of the grandkids, but nowhere close to how much we used to go...oh wait, stopped today, just for a drink, a sign on every parking spot that only drive thru was open... Ordered, then once again held hostage in the drive thru for 11 minutes, one car in front of me...I think it's time to contact corporate and ask if they know what's going on there..."}
{"text":"I ordered two master blasts with dinner.  One came with the food, but the other not for over 30 minutes - after I was finished.  Two diet sprites took 10 minutes and were brown, not clear

This is a management issue since the cashier is the only person that can make the blasts.  There were another four or five people in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I've never had a hard time at a sonic before, except for this location. They barely speak English, they don't know their own menu, and they messed up my order 2 times. Come on, your job can not be that confusing..."}
{"text":"Really nice, modern, clean location. Good service and food. \"As good as it gets\" for a Sonic."}
{"text":"Blast fail.  Ordered chocolate chip cookie dough blast at drive thru.  Got home to onlt cookie dough sprinkled in top of pitiful whipped cream.  No cookie dough, no chocolate chips, no flavor, and air straight down the center.  Lost my future business."}
{"text":"The standards at this location have been on a steady decline.  My usually favorite cookie dough flavored Master Blast has been made with dried out nuggets of cookie dough.   Who wants to bite into pellets of dried out chalky dough??  And our Oreo Blasts have not properly mixed and left with a hollow center on a regular basis.  At times we find bits of other flavors on our blast indicating that they obviously aren't completely cleaning their equipment from the last customer order.  C'mon Sonic, keep your game tight.

For Blasts done right, the one at 3431 N. Ranco Drive is worth a stop."}
{"text":"Had to send my slush back because it was too strong he then brought it back and the slush was white/clear. There was like half the flavoring. Guess that's what I get for complaining, I should have drank my cup of syrup."}
{"text":"Decent food with a decent staff and wait time. Pretty consistent order accuracy."}
{"text":"sitting in drive through right now. They are out of strawberry this time. the last time I came in, the shake machine was down. the time before that, they had no corn dogs or hot dogs.The time before that, the shake machine was brokwn. Everytime I come here, something is either broken, or they are out of a product.  I think I'm done coming here, it's always a disappointment."}
{"text":"Sonic's so good.. i always get the Streawberry slash sooo good it quitches ur thurst on a hot summer... awesome... u need to take ur family to sonic's!"}
{"text":"It's like they took all the worst employees at surrounding fast food restaurants and stuck them here. They've gotten one out of 5 drive through orders right. Don't go here"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their staff! First drive-thru I've been to where they actually care whether or not they have your order right. Great place at night!"}
{"text":"...bottom line, i hate this place. slimey brown lettuce, over riped and mashy tomatoes. they never get your order right, even the tots suck here. close this place down soon. i'm never going back"}
{"text":"I love Sonic's amazing selection of drinks, slushes, shakes, malts, and pretty much and variation of beverage.  Usually the speedy service is also a plus when it comes to picking up some quality fast food.  However, I was there the other night and chose the drive-thru (versus parking and ordering), and wound up sitting in line for over ten minutes before I opted to get out of line and just park.  Two different cars ahead of me either had massive orders, indecisive drivers, or incompetent order-takers.  It could have been all three, but it was the longest wait I've ever experience, with no one attempting to move it along any quicker.

I will note, however, that the strawberry slush I eventually brought home was refreshing and amazing."}
{"text":"Service seems good. Came because the one review was 5 stars. The Speaker system is very staticky so hard to hear and hurts your ears trying to listen. Only reason I am not giving 5 stars. Quick and accurate service. When delivering the girl notice my root bear float wasn't blended so she took it back to fix it. Nice attention to detail."}
{"text":"I agree with almost every other review other then the one complimenting this place!!!! I have gone here for years and given them to many chances! The night crew are a waste of
Space on this earth and the African American employee has a terrible attitude , if 5 drinks are ordered  a cup holder is not something to get pissed about if requested!! I am scared to even drink this because she most likely did something terrible to them, it took her to long to come back and she almost threw them at me!  I hope they shut this place down!"}
{"text":"I've never had a good experience at this Sonic. Today was probably the worst service I've received here. I was in a long line of cars, and when it came to be my turn at the speaker, I waited several minutes for somebody to take my order. Nothing. I finally started calling out \"Hello?\" several times. Still nothing. Finally, I drove up to window and waited several minutes. Nobody acknowledged me. I had to flag down an employee who was bringing an order out to a car and asked if the speaker was broken. He said it wasn't. I told him that nobody was answering or acknowledging me, so I wasn't able to place my order. He said he would get the manager to come to the window and take my order. I watched as the employee went in and spoke to the manager. I then saw the manager WALK AWAY in the opposite direction. Several minutes later, I guess the manager realized that I was holding up the line and came out to ask me what the issue with my order was. I told him that I hadn't even placed my order yet because nobody answered me at the speaker. He tried to say that sometimes when the cars are too close together, they can't tell when a new car is ready to order. I told him that made zero sense because I called out \"hello\" several times for several minutes and still nobody answered.I ended up leaving without getting anything because I was fed up. Based on my past experiences with this location, the staff either don't care about their customers or they don't want to work...either way, they've lost me as a customer for good."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could. After waiting in the drive-through for half an hour they told us they cannot take credit cards."}
{"text":"I've been waiting more than 15 minutes for a cheeseburger.  Is this normal?????? Lol. Sonic is usually fast. Just in case this is usual... you should know you might wait.  

Probably means I shouldn't be eating this cheeseburger and breaking my paleo-ish-ness."}
{"text":"Great food and a friendly staff. I had the boneless chicken wings and they were phenomenal and half price! Quick service and the employees were very nice. I also recommend the breakfast toast sandwich with sausage or bacon. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Why are you so slow to make 7 milkshakes?!?! SLOOOOOOWWWWWW. I would recommend to speed up your service. Ookkkaaaayyy."}
{"text":"Tiger the assistant manager helped me with my food order yesterday it was 120 out and I had to wait a little longer he compt my food order. He was so awesome they were short staffed he was so nice!!!"}
{"text":"I went one day for the half of shakes and it was full but it was easy to park and then it came fast and cheap go on a day that is not busy"}
{"text":"This place is consistently getting crappier and crappier... I've lived near here for 10 years and it used to be great. Now it's ran by a bunch of smart mouthed teenagers that are extremely lazy. Three nights in a row their slushy machine has been \"broken\" but if you come during the day it works... so basically they shut their machine off a few hours before closing so that they don't have to when it's time to ACTUALLY close. I called the guy out on it over the intercom tonight and he never said a word back. You ALWAYS have to wait 15+ for food no matter the time or how busy and 9 times out of 10 the order will be wrong. Such a pathetic business, that needs some serious management makeover. 

I would give it 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Ordered a bacon cheeseburger and when I got home with it discovered there was no bacon and a HUGE pile of lettuce. Manager said to come back and they would give me another but I was too busy.  Seriously, how can you forget the the bacon on a bacon cheeseburger?"}
{"text":"How does one mess up cheese fries?  They did it 3 times and thats not all they messed up.  I told them I would never eat at their place again which is a bummer due to it being close to me.  The manager was very nice but the cooks don't care and the manager keeps them employed."}
{"text":"Ok so like i said i was going to return for drinks only... not anymore. This place seriously has issues. I came through the drive thru to order a master shake, they had nothing but one customer in front of me. I was at the voice box and the order taker today asked me what i would like to order. So i asked for a shake and he interrupted me by saying  sorry give me one moment please. And i didnt just give him a moment, i gave him 10 mins. When he came back on he said bare with me just a moment, give me a couple more minutes and so i said nvr mind and left. Are u fucking kidding me. U had only one customer. Nobody was parked and for me to wait that long at the voice box was very irritating. Never coming back. This place does not even deserve the 2 stars it has. Horrible food and bad customer service. So sad bcus i was really craving a master shake!"}
{"text":"The WORST sonic I have ever been to. Pulled up to drive thru and I was the only car in line. Ordered 4 shakes/drinks. Got to the window and there was probably 10+ employees just standing there. No one working or anything. I decided to add a water to my order. I got a water with lemon (typically they only charge $1) but they charged me $3 for a WATER. Service was so slow and employees were rude and didn't care about the business at all it seems. Also the whole thing took about 20 mins(from ordering until the time I was handed the order) I would be embarrassed to be the manager of this location."}
{"text":"Mistakes happen, but they should be corrected. I called the number on the receipt to complain about the #1 I received with no burger patty. The lady I spoke with said they couldn't refund my order or help any way other than letting the owner of that store know. She also assured me that the owner would contact me to rectify the situation. I provided contact information, but no one ever contacted me about it.  This trouble is not worth a $6 burger."}
{"text":"I love Sonic, but this one is a joke. Terrible service. Slow to take your order after pulling up to the drive through, then even the simplest of orders takes forever, and they get the order wrong half the time. Only go for happy hour for drinks any more! Maybe better employees that give at least half a crap and it would be okay..."}
{"text":"What a joke! I can't recall ever having gone through a drive-thru with an bigger group of incompetent idiots running it. Wow. I went through and when ordering, I had a question. Every time I would ask the question, the kid would interrupt me and say, \"I'm sorry, what was your question?\" So, after a few times of this back and forth nonsense, I asked him if I had his attention and was he ready for my question. Sure enough, he did it again. I figured by now, he must've been just being a jerk. So, I just ordered something else instead of dealing with his bull. Got up to the window and my order was incorrect. Tator tots were cold and when I asked if they were fresh, another kid said they were. Certainly not the case. There were a few other nuisances that are not mentioned here. I will be sure to go out of my to not come back to this location, with these clowns working. Management  needs to step in and get a grip on these kids."}
{"text":"They have half price happy hour on all drinks.  I ordered an iced mocha, which is a drink, and they refused to give me the discount.  Mind you an iced mocha is milk, a shot of espresso, chocolate syrup, and ice, aka a drink!   They still refused, and told me that an iced mocha was an ice cream, I will not be back!"}
{"text":"I like the old fashion idea of roller skates. It is fast food, but the people always seem friendly and it is convenient to just drive up order and get my food delivered right to the car. Good job."}
{"text":"No wonder this place has only 2 stars. The customer service is terrible, it took them 20 minutes for a simple large order of mozzarella sticks. After all the time you they still managed to mess up my order. Terrible service!"}
{"text":"I waited 30 min in Two different carHop stalls.  Actuated the order screen. No one ever responded.  Others on either side of me left for same reason.  Staff the establishment for business, or close It!  Too bad...  These are great places in the south."}
{"text":"Terrible. I really should have learned my lesson after the first time, so maybe I'm really to blame. Every damn time they mess up my order. Pretty sure they straight give me someone else's food. The fries ALWAYS taste like they were cooked yesterday, stale and cold. I've found more edible fries under the seat of my car. 
What a waste. It shouldn't be this difficult to get a quick burger."}
{"text":"Not sure my foot long coney was actually 12 inches. And my daughter cheeseburger had no cheese but the young man behind the counter was a pleasure to work with."}
{"text":"Horrible there is always something wrong with my food order and sometimes I will be waiting for a very long time"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Not only did it take 30 minutes to get through the drive thru, which is irritating enough, we got the added pleasure of not being greeted at the window until we finally honked our horn after 10 minutes of watching 3 teenage girls laughing and dicking around in plain sight. No apologies or explanation on where our food was...or how long it would take. Another 10 minutes go by and we finally get our food only to discover, as we drive away, that half the order is wrong.....so we got to hang out for another 10 minutes waiting for the correction. Oh, and the girl offered us a coin for a free drink for our troubles. Seriously, my family and I wasted all this time because of your inability to do your job and you give us a free drink? I wasn't waiting for compensation so please don't insult me with a drink for me and my family to share.  A sincere apology would have sufficed. 

Appropriate words cannot express these girls' lack of professionalism, respect, and accountability. Whatever manager thought these girls were a good choice to close the store should revisit the hiring and training section of the SOP. I will not be returning Sonic."}
{"text":"I have to say this is the worst fast food out there. The meat was dried out and not sure if it's beef, my bun was hard and old, fries cold and a old oil taste. The service is always horrible, it's been months since I've been there and I live  across the street and hoped it might have been better..."}
{"text":"The manager (Chris) decided to have a domestic fight with his girlfriend in the parking lot on 10-18-2016, he was yelling at her in her PT Cruiser, either slammed the door or punched the roof, all we heard was a loud bang of the car metal, then opened the door, pushed her aside and drove off angry to the back lot of sonic where the dumsters are, the car went from drive to reverse a couple times, then they both got out, he was still yelling at her and she was fast walking away from him to the other side of the car as he followed her. They stayed back there for over 35 mins arguing while the manager was still on the clock. Meanwhile the drive thru is piling up with orders and unhappy customers leaving the drive thru line. I approached the other team members to get another managers or the owners phone number, instead they went out back to the parked car and got the very angry, disturbed manager and when he came up to us he said it \"was none of our business\" I told him bringing his personal issues to work while on the clock as a manager as well as yelling and fighting with someone in front of paying customers while trying to enjoy a meal was more than my business, he swore at me and i asked why he thought it was necessary to swear at me when i was treating him with respect and i had my younger brother and wife with me.  I was disturbed by the whole scene as i had my wife and 2 friends, and younger brother with me, we were just trying to have a nice time out. This is VERY unacceptable in every aspect. We have had issues in the past such as incorrect orders but they have always been rectified, there is no way to make this right. This manager needs fired. Chris did give me a phone number finally and only after threatening to call the police, for Roy, another manager who did not answer when i called."}
{"text":"Good tasty food, not overcrowded. I never see it filled to capacity, their desserts are amazing. Friendly staff that brings your item to the car."}
{"text":"I usually go to other drive thru places and came across sonic and gave them a try since it was my first time, I gotta tell ya the hot dog was amazing, I will deff be back and support the business.."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through to get my mom a bag of ice and the line was long which isn't my complaint I understand this type of business gets busy and I understand that there is normally hardworking individuals trying to accomplish every customers order as efficiently as possible. I now realize that wasn't the case for everyone working at sonic tonight I pulled up to the window after waiting 15 minutes in the line to see hardworking individuals doing ten things at once. My complaint is that one worker was stuffing her face with an ice cream and texting in plain view of the window, granted she could have been on break or off the clock or whatever she may have been, it was disrespectful not only to the company but to her fellow hardworking coworkers."}
{"text":"When the price in the printed menu doesn't jive with the price you charge something is wrong. And to have employees tell you it's the system and there is nothing they can do about it makes it even more frustrating. You are overcharging every person who orders a combo. Get it right!"}
{"text":"0 stars for this Sonic. Very bad customer service. Employees are rude & sassy! Don't come here...ever."}
{"text":"Best Sonic N Las Vegas!! Good customer service, very friendly employees no matter how late it is.  Would come here again and again."}
{"text":"Great food! Carhops are cute! Service was good and food was hot! They cook to order and deliver on skates! How cool is that! I told the manager about Yelp and he said \"Anyone who reads this review and comes to my Sonic will get a surprise!\" \"A free Jr. Candy Sundae with the purchase of a combo!\"  That's pretty cool of him. It's only good at this location so if you like being spoiled, stop by and mention \"Yelp\" you get this deal!"}
{"text":"Lady with the attitude operating the drive-through at 10:12 AM on October 5 thumbs down to you. Got upset because I had a $.99 large soda coupon text to me. I pulled into their drive-through to use it I'm not kidding you when I tell you my whole glass is filled with ice I got maybe four drink some soda, hope that made her day"}
{"text":"I never have issues coming here , but we went today and the girl named katiie gave my boyfriend and I the worst attitude ever. Im not coming here ever again."}
{"text":"Love their diet cherry limeade!!! So refreshing for low cals!!! Definitley a place to stop with these 100+ degree weather!! Oh and if you love shakes... and chocolate oh an bananas.. try the choc. banana shake!! loveeeeeee it! :)"}
{"text":"I'm loving Sonics new boneless wings.  Not so much at this location though. They barely put any sauce on them.  No napkins either. Didn't realize it till I drove off. I guess it didn't matter that much since there wasn't much sauce."}
{"text":"They deserve 0 stars , their limeades are always flat, corn dogs soggy, and grilled cheese dry as f***"}
{"text":"As someone who loves Sonic and enjoys their overall brand, this location is consistently one of the worst fast food locations I've been too. In 5+ trips since moving to Gastonia, I've yet to have a trio where either the wait was more than 15 minutes for no more than 2 people, or the order was wrong. Their intercom system doesn't work well and the waitresses often don't read you back a total and have even lost my order altogether. I've given them multiple opportunities but after today am done. I'll save my sonic visits for trips out of town and recommend the same to you."}
{"text":"Will never go tongue sonic again, not sure what has happened to it, used to be good but now the service is painfully slow and the food is cold and disgusting. I know it's fast food...but have some pride in what you are serving people. I tried to call to complain to them directly but they don't answer their phone either."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! we ordered 2 medium master blasts and got one medium and one small. We ordered a triple chocolate and a cookie dough blast. Triple chocolate didn't have any chocolate at all except for the chocolate chips on top of the whip cream. The cookie dough last had like 2 cookie dough chunks. Not only did we get are order completely wrong the lady was incredibly rude. I will never come back to this location again. They don't even deserve a star."}
{"text":"Don't come here if your in hurry for your 30min lunch. It will take half of your lunch to get your food."}
{"text":"Gave me 3 limes and NO cherry in my cherry limeade! Fix this NOW SONIC.... my drink was called a cherry limeade and I expect cherries in my drink!!! It was NOT called a lime limeade so I have no idea why I got THREE LIMES!!!"}
{"text":"Service is great. Happy hour drinks are bomb when I get the timing right- lol
Never had rude service or a wrong order here.."}
{"text":"i been here couple times and press the call button and no one came.
they were open and people in cars around eating but must have been busy.
all i wantd was a drink but went to qt instead"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick meal. Ordered the numder 1 meal add bacon. Made it home, took a bite of the burger and to my surprise no burger"}
{"text":"The shakes are great, but the service at this particular location was subpar. I went through the drive-thru and had to repeat my 2 item order 3 or 4 times. At the window, the guy asked for the wrong total, then forgot to give me change."}
{"text":"Service from window cashier was awesome just wait too long for food, about 30-40mins so it's not really \"fast food\" otherwise great!!!"}
{"text":"One good thing about Vegas is the wide variety of dining options. 
And one of them is definitely Sonic Drive-In. I go out of my way to
find a Sonic (I have to,since there are none near the Strip). Everything
at Sonic is delicious. I wish there were Sonics in Northern California,
then I wouldn't feel obligated to visit one every time we're down here."}
{"text":"Worst service and food ever. Had to go to mcdonalds afterwards to get real food. Very sad that the service Took 25 minutes from when we pulled in to get food


Food was cold and tasted like it was cooked a long time before we got there.   Kids and family all agree that this is the first and last time ever going to sonic"}
{"text":"The food was good, location was clean, Staff was great & Fast. I am just not a Fan of Sonic Drive-In"}
{"text":"Worst place to buy blasts ....spent 20 on 4 blasts only to find when we got home that majority of the blast is plain vanilla ice cream the ingredients  were only mixed in at the very top of the cup over 3/4 of it was plain ice cream  ...i ordered a resses blast and it had oreos mixed in with it...yuck also my boyfriend got a carmel brownie and that blast had no carmel  I mean seriously  how can u miss that main ingredient  ????...very disapointed  ...defiantly got ripped off here...and definitely  recommend  not to waste your money here ."}
{"text":"Super clean... Customer service is amazing... Would definitely recommend and will be back... Come here for lunch break with my classmates quite often never had a bad experience"}
{"text":"They can't even take an order properly. Ordered a bacon burger and they didn't even put bacon on my burger. Ask the black girl with braided hair for some fry sauce and she says okay and get my bag no fry sauce so I gotta ask again should of checked my burger before I left. Yeah probably not gonna go back unless it's for a drink hope they can make they correct"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick lunch or dinner don't do the drive thru. The lines are very long. But if you do the tables or car hop they are fast. They have a good verity of semi health to just dang good food. I like that I can get breakfast all day."}
{"text":"Pulled in to a stall at 11am, ordered two slushes and a limeaid. It's 11:25 and now follow up, response or car hop. Paid, no one around to help.This is ridiculous. 

Following up, ugh and apathy. I love sonic!! Why do you have to suck?"}
{"text":"This place needs to shut down.....the popcorn chicken my son order was so hard, no chicken on the inside. His corn dog looked it was fried and fried again.  Everything tastes like it was sitting in a month old grease pit.  Nasty.....!!!  I wish there was a zero star rating"}
{"text":"Came here 1.5hrs before closing time and pulled into a bay only to be told over the speaker that is was \"drive-thru only\" right now. Hmmm maybe because I see a few employees in uniform just sitting around outside. Ordered an Oreo Sonic Blast and was given a straw with it, yeah this isn't exactly a drink or even a shake - I had to ask for a spoon. Of couse it wouldn't matter much after I found the Blast only 3/4 full. And after reaching the halfway point of the cup there was only plain ice cream left so only 1/4 of my actual cup was the actual Blast I paid for. At least the employees sitting around outside seemed to be enjoying their food."}
{"text":"Worst place ever to get a blizzard.. My boyfriend and I got a snickers one and no snickers in it.. What a waste of time and money..."}
{"text":"Always have a great experience at this sonic. Menu is just like any other sonic and customer service is always good. I'll be back to this location again!"}
{"text":"Completely underwhelmed! This place is so hit or miss, but lately it has been a huge miss! The food is completely overcooked and tastes like it has sat out all day."}
{"text":"The family and i went out for a late night treat and had the best service from the friendly Joseph.....the wait wasnt long at all, he brought out our order with a smile! Unfortunately my ice cream wasnt quite what i ordered......so Joseph went back still with a smile to fix it, was even nice enough to let us keep the ice cream that was a mistake....with all that said Joseph made our late night run well worth it! Thank u Joseph u were awesome!"}
{"text":"Everything here screams poor quality. I don't know if I should trust the meat here. This is definitely on the lower end of fast food places in terms of quality and taste. They come up with crazy combinations which don't always work out."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I always try a place twice. First time I came here, I pushed the button to order and waited ...for 5 minutes to order and ended up leaving.  Second time, I ordered 2 Jr cheeseburgers and a small fry...I waited for 10 minutes for my food and it was cold. When I paid cash the lady had the nerve to ask if I wanted my change. Of course I do! Its not like you deserve it! You should never ask that! I wont be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was the 2nd time I've been @ this location & sadly it will be our last. My husband ordered the chili cheese coney with tots & rt 44 strawberry real fruit slush & I ordered nothing since I'm not a sonic fan. Thank goodness, because fast forward to 9 hours later at weeee early in the morning (2,3,4 am)....BAM..FOOD POISONING!!!  All the symptoms & more. My husband is the type of person once something traumatized him that is it. So I think sonic just lost a customer for good!!! Customer service & food taste aside, the after results just left a bad impression overall!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good service usually. And they are always open!! I love my dirty diet cokes.  The food is okay"}
{"text":"This review is specific to there chilli dogs. I went expecting the worst, and they were worse than I expected. 
One word: Nasty!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for terrible service and an upset stomach, you've come to the right place.  My husband and I tried Sonic for the first time today, and we ate inside.  The girl at the counter had no idea how to input orders (she kept calling the manager to help her) and was having an issue with EVERY customer.  My husband ordered (and when I say ordered, I meant repeated it three times because the cashier couldn't get it) just a cheeseburger with bbq sauce on it.  That's it.  His cheeseburger came with no cheese and no bbq sauce, just a burger patty with some lettuce.  He went to the counter to get some bbq sauce from them, but the cashier shot him a dirty look, and then proceeded to ignore him.

Our tots were cold and greasy (and frankly the frozen ones from the grocery store are better) and my chocolate milkshake was pure sweet syrup, and undrinkable.  I threw it out.  To sum up, terrible service and \"food\"."}
{"text":"The service is good, the hot dogs are the Best,the main problem is their soggy,stale,sometimes oily \"French Fries\"......"}
{"text":"The past few times that I've been here have just been bad. The first few times the kid with glasses on skates doesn't know how to be professional or at least customer service friendly. He talked ghetto on the speaker phone calling me a \"G\" and the next time we came the same guy called me fat! Joking or not, I don't appreciate it. Then last night, a different worker was leaving, he asked me and my friends if we had a stogie. This sonic is just not what I want to experience."}
{"text":"This place will definitely try your patience, food is good enough, but yet slow. I guess made to order, maybe a tad overpriced, but it's a drive thru. Live about a mile away and cringe when the wife says \" Let's get Sonic \" cause I know what's in store. The reviews are right. Orders are consistently wrong, the wait times, all of it. Past 10 years have been back, maybe once a month. Like I said patience will be tested, check your order before you leave the window, I have returned many times to just wait in the line again. And have found I drive a lot crazier leaving there wondering what just happened, EVERY time"}
{"text":"I have been coming here everyday after work for 5yrs. I order the same thing every day. These people never and I mean never get it right. And every weekend I'm here order the same dam thing for 5yrs. Never do they get it right. The owner / GM should do some recon instead of playing bigshot. Wish I could add a picture of the ultimate meat and cheese burrito they just brought me. Which had to push button again to get the salsa I asked for. Bad management. ....."}
{"text":"Come once every blue moon but the server we had last night was amazing and food was great"}
{"text":"This Sonic has got to be the slowest fast food place in the country. We have gone there three times, each time thinking they can't possibly be as slow as the last time and we are proven wrong each time. It takes a minimum of 25 minutes to get your order, and it is usually wrong."}
{"text":"Ten minutes minimum in the drive through. Constantly have to hand them back the tater tots (I patiently waited for) because they are old and cold. I gave it an extra star because I feel the management is trying. I hate to complain but they are understanding and eager to correct the mistake. I hope this location gets better because it's close to my house and I do like the food when it's hot."}
{"text":"NO! NO! NO! Aren't the slushes supposed to be slushy? Not here! My brother order a strawberry slush and got water with strawberry flakes and weird ass shaped ice cubes...What the hell is that?! I saw the slush machine. Where the hell did they get these ice cubes from? Oh and thanks for the taking our order of Breakfast toasters and burritos. I really enjoyed getting on the freeway and eating damn chicken burgers."}
{"text":"CRAZY SLOW, I have been here 4 times. 3 of those I left after waiting in the drive through for 10 mins. The 1 other time reminded me why I only go there when I'm making poor choices. Fast food can only be bad or quick, not both!!!"}
{"text":"I really like Sonic's fries and the vintage style of the restaurant, but every time I come here they forget something I ordered or charge the wrong amount. However, the employees are nice about it...but it gets a little frustrating when it occurs repeatedly."}
{"text":"This is the worst sonic I have been to.  The service is slow, the food is bad - buns that are half frozen, cheese sticks ice cold and barely cook french fries - more than 1 time.  You would think I would learn and give up, but no I keep hoping they will get better.  This week was the last try - they had no ice.  How is that possible in AZ in the summer.  I am done."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru ever - constantly waiting. Clearly there are only 2 people working this evening."}
{"text":"All the negative reviews are true. This place is literally ran by 16 year olds. No this isn't some mean way to criticize adults. They are quite literally all kids. No management or oversight and is extremely chaotic. I ordered 2 hot dogs and it took LITERALLY 15 minutes. There were like 4 other cars there. Avoid."}
{"text":"Took all my family to have a drive in dinner. And no joke but! As we started to sit down to eat, I had a bite of a non- double patty burger with only green chili, onions and pickles No MEAT???? Where's the beef? Understatement.. never again will I go to this location, and then to get in an argument about the refund with the assistant Mgr. Thanks but NO thanks."}
{"text":"Ordered at 11:39, food finally arrived at 12:95. Not a good choice if you only have half an hour for lunch.

There is no amount of friendly and helpful that can make up for a tragedy like this kitchen. 

Don't bother with the \"croissant\" dog, it's just some butter flavoring in a regular bun.

Overall, a disappointing experience ."}
{"text":"worst sonic ever.. been waiting 30 plus mins for cheeseburger and fries... i waisted most my lunch waiting for my food... they messed up the ladies order from drive threw and shes waiting too.. dont come here.."}
{"text":"Garbage made by teenagers that look like they're out on parole. I also smelled marijuana coming from the dumpster area."}
{"text":"Food is good but I shouldn't have to wait 45 mins in the drive thru. Would have left but there were other cars behind me so I couldn't back out"}
{"text":"Wrong order and no receipt so I can't even take it back!!!!! I love Sonic but this one is horrible.  LT he food is cold, cheese not even melted, and slow service. It's like they want to go out of business.  Oh and mustard is the yellow one - I'd expect a hamburger joint to know this."}
{"text":"If I could LESS than one star I would.  My family waited weeks to try it out, because they were crazy busy, and I wanted to wait till they were running more smoothly.  Well, they are still crazy and the bugs remain!  My son ordered an inedible burger, tasted terrible, the onion rings are disgustingly sweet (the coating was like cookies, yuck!) and my food was cold...a vile excuse for a chili dog with cheese.  My husband ordered a wrap, but the outside was wet and gummy.  We carried-out or believe me, I would have demanded my money back.  I still might complain in person because I feel like they stole my $16... The staff was running around with their heads cut off and the counter person did not check our bag to see if the order was correct.  It wasn't: 3 times!  They need to get there \"stuff\" together, because you only have one chance to make a good impression, and they wasted their opportunity with me.  I doubt I will ever return.  Sad."}
{"text":"Slow service...  Carside podiums are a bit run down. Otherwise it's a sonic.  Same food everywhere. Seems clean. Staff is friendly when they do answer the intercom or show up."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  A very simple 3 item order had to be repeated 4 times and they still got it wrong.  And it took 20 minutes to get the food.  Never again.  The prices are high."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! 17 mins in the drive-thru for a kids meal to still get the order wrong.  The child that took my order sounded very rude and the horse play is not for work! Step y'all game up or go work at Walmart"}
{"text":"Great food. However no food is worth waiting 20 minutes in the Drive-Thru for. Its a shame because i love the food but fast food should have an emphasis on \"fast\"."}
{"text":"Rude customer service. Everytime my family and I would stop by for shakes there is a long line,but employees standing outside talking,having a smoke,etc. 30+ minutes waiting."}
{"text":"I work very close by and I usually get my snacks here after work. food is your average fast food. But the service is very fast since I get super hungry after work and wanted a grab and go food right away. I ordered chili cheese tots one time . the server gave it to me in a bag. No reminder or heads up that o need to get the bag through the side the way he handed it to me. So I took the bag. Held it like what other fast food bag (grabbed on the top). And next thing I know I got chilli cheese all over the bag inside .. I asked nicely if I can get another one. they were kind enough to change it. But the server looked so pissed.. :(. I was I said thank you and he just walked away.."}
{"text":"I love Sonic, I have been to many different locations.  I went to this location to get some quick food at 11am.  I had 1 car in front of me in the drive threw and I sat behind this car for over 10 minutes after they took my order.  When I got to the window I asked the girl what was the hold up.  She rudely said \"we only have 1 cook\" and shut the drive threw window.  I completely understand having people call out or being short handed, but she was completely rude.  Then she opens the window to give me my card back and didn't even make eye contact with me.  She gave my order to me and didn't even say a word.  It was honestly the worst service I've ever had at sonic.  I will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"Sonic offers appetizing fast food and seems to be open at all hours of the day, every day.  Drive-thru, walk-up, or drive-up to order. Super inexpensive food that satisfies my late-night cravings.  

Some of my favorite menu items are:
- I love the Kid's Meal, especially the enticing Grilled Cheese!  
- Breakfast Toaster (Huge plus that breakfast is served all day)
- Oreo Sonic Blasts (Kind of reminds me of McDonald's McFlurry)
- Strawberry Limeade
- Coneys, Hotdogs, Corndogs
- Tator tots!

Location:
This Sonic location was rather difficult to find when locating it for the first time.  It's not on Flamingo Rd (the main road); instead it is hidden on the side of the plaza."}
{"text":"Now this is such an amazing restaurant, especially their mozzarella sticks which are just delectable. The atmosphere is amazing and it's a nice throwback to those older drive in restaurants that were a big part of American culture in the 70s. The service was very fast and the mozzarella sticks were the perfect temperature when they came out. The best part about the restaurant is that it's named after my favorite character from Mario."}
{"text":"Great burgers really fast brought to your car by rollerskating servers. The food is good for the price and the specials change often enough to keep things different.

My only complaint is the loud music. The songs vary, which is fine, but the volume is cranked way up and the quality is horrible. And there are no spots outside of the speaker's range. So you either listen to that or roll up your windows and turn your own music up. I wish at least one part of this Sonic didn't have music -- I'm in my own car, I think I can cover the music for myself!"}
{"text":"Last time I went here took three tries to get hot fries. I like Chicago dogs so decided to try again. Big mistake. Stale bun, cold dog. Slow service. Told waitress I will try again next year!! (NOT!!)"}
{"text":"This is the most annoying sonics I've ever been too they never get my order right I ordered a number two with mayo lettuce and cheese only they gave me everything even after I asked if they heard my order correctly. Sure it looks nice but the food service is seriously disappointing"}
{"text":"Very nice staff but long wait for food on a quiet Saturday morning.
\"Fast Food\" needs to be quick and convenient.  If the \"fast\" part of the proposition is missing repeat business will suffer."}
{"text":"Okay. I am a huge fan of sonic, ever since one opened up in Wisconsin where I am originally from. The one here on Nellis blvd however literally pissed me off to the point I took 10 minutes out of my day to register on yelp, download the app and write a review. Sadly, this is even after making a call to corporate. 

As far as their food, it's AMAZING when you actually get what you ordered. That, and if its actually hot when you receive it.

In the past month and a half I have gone to sonic 5 times, and I will describe in detail how my experiences went. 

1)
I order the exact same thing every time. Jumbo spicy popcorn chicken, large fry, small/medium vanilla shake minus whip cream/cherry, and 2 ranch dipping sauces. Sounds easy right? First visit I ordered this meal, it went flawlessly. Ill give them that much. 

2)
Ordered same meal as above only this time there was whip cream and a cherry, and i was missing my ranch dipping sauces. Okay no big deal, shrugged it off and disposed of the whip cream and cherry, and had ranch in the fridge. 

3)
Ordered same meal, but also bought my buddy the #1 combo, minus everything except added mayo, normal size, diet doctor pepper as my buddy is diabetic. What did I get? Regular size popcorn chicken, regular fry, and SURPRISE they get the shake right. They forgot the sauces. Again. My buddy didnt fare so well. His burger had everything on it, with added bacon? Wtf? Okay..oh yeah and a REGULAR doctor pepper which could've ended in a diabetic seizure. Not to mention his regular size fry ended up being large, which I guess is free added size but still screwed up nonetheless. 

4)
Same meal, only my chicken and fries were cold. Not only that the chicken was not even edible.

5)
Today, 5/14/13, my girlfriend and I went there to give them one last chance. Same meal, and she got the 3 chicken strip combo with 1 ranch 1 barbecue. We ended up receiving cold food, no sauces, no straw, and we decided to get a refund and leave. However, the manager George was an incredibly patient and outstanding person, I recommend him for a pay increase. I'm glad he gave me a refund, with absolutely no hassle. 

Oh, and 2 of these visits I had an incredibly rude waitress. I wish I had her name. 

Overall I would recommend sonic to anybody, just not this location. I give up on giving them chances, they have lost my business even after giving them WAY too many chances to improve. Go elsewhere, you'll be far better off."}
{"text":"This is the slowest sonic I've ever been to. First, we went to the pull up window and that took 15 mins for the employee to talk to us. 

A different day we decided to give it another shot but we went through the drive through the instead and that took us about 30 mins in line. 

We live right down the street so it's convenient. 

A week later we went back and low and behold it was the same story. This is ridiculous for a sonic to be this slow. Granted the employee at the window was nice but still they need to get it together."}
{"text":"Usually stop by for a vanilla coke. Got a burger today, was more than half way done and bit into a hair.  About 4 inches long and black or dark brown. I'm a red head, so it was not mine. Plus it was imbedded in the cheese.  ICK. I was so grossed out I tossed everything left and took off. :("}
{"text":"Manager Michelle is very nice and accommodating.  I showed up pretty late and they didn't have much cooking.  She made our orders and she was very friendly.  She seems to be very concerned for her staffs well being."}
{"text":"We have had a slow experience at sonic each time we have gone but tonight it was horrible.  We waited to be acknowledged to order on the patio for 15 minutes.  No \" I'll be with you shortly\"...nothing.  I noticed there was no traffic in the drive through.  I got in our car with one person in front of me.  Someone told hm they would be right with him but then nothing for 10 minutes!  I finally decided to load up the kids and go to Culver's in middleton.  They were busy but we were warmly greeted, promptly had our order taken, table was wiped down for us immediately and then the food was the high quality it always is.  My kids like sonic occasionally but they need better management and different employees."}
{"text":"Terrible service. My husband, 2 kids and I have been to this Sonic a handful of times and this will be the last. Each time we have come it has gotten progressively worse. Today it took my husband 10 minutes just to order. He would order something and get a \"just a minute\" in return after EACH item. When he asked her to repeat our order 2 of the things were wrong so he corrected her. When we finally got our order those two things were STILL wrong and also wrong on the ticket. We sent them back and when we got them back it was wrong AGAIN, but in a different way! We will never be back to this Sonic again."}
{"text":"Still my most favorite hot dog ever and I think the magic is in the presentation. They've got the best hot dog sleeve. It perfectly holds the dog, lots of chili and it's not messy.

Another must have is a Cherry Lime Squeeze; Sprite, Cherry flavor, squeezed limes and maraschino cherries."}
{"text":"Poor service I didn't receive my drinks and the manger was rude and wasn't even trying to refund my money or give me the drinks. Pretty much I was robbed and not the manger or the DM helped. So don't waste your time and money here they'll take your money!!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised how bad the reviews are. I went here twice the past week. The customer service was excellent. All the food and malt shakes we got were great. The kids meal toys were also very cool(shark stuff). I can't believe I have lived so close by and never tried eating here. The menu is large and there are so many flavor of shakes/slushies/master blasts. Half price shakes after 8pm through summer! Kids and adults in my family love it!"}
{"text":"Every time I go here there is always something wrong with my order always check your food before you leave I guarantee you will always be missing something or something ain't right."}
{"text":"good food, good service and nice location.
got the food i ordered and it didn't look like it was thrown together ."}
{"text":"I love to go to Sonic and get there Philly and there onion rings.  They also have a great variety of drink options you can't get anywhere else."}
{"text":"the service is SO AWFUL but the shakes are good, we waited at the drivethru window for 20 MINUTES just for milkshakes.. it was painful. everytime we visit this sonic the wait is over 10 minutes just for the drivethru. dont waste your time."}
{"text":"I am only giving this Sonic 2 stars because their strawberry lemonade slushie is the perfect mix with a few shots of vodka (as past reviewer mentioned). However, without the liquor their drinks even suck. You mostly get slush and not that much flavoring. So, if you're ordering a large you'll probably have half a cup left of just plain slush. This bugs me. If you're going to buy a drink at least buy it from 2-4 when their half price..

Everything else, including their food is a severe disappointment if I ever seen one. I know it's fast food, but come on. Even McDonald's isn't this bad and I hate that place too. Like past reviewers said, the food is pretty much tasteless and bland. They have a dollar menu so if you're thinking about buying food please buy off that. Do not pay regular prices for what I would describe as pretty much nothing. I can't believe I actually ate their food more than once. Blahh."}
{"text":"Enjoy the food and love that it's so close. More then once we had to wait at the speaker for about 15 minutes before we got an answer from the cashier. At times the staff inside aren't very friendly and cop an attitude with you right off the bat."}
{"text":"I feel like during the day, this Sonic is great, but at night the staff is uncaring and extremely insensitive. I understand having to work night shifts is hard, but that doesn't mean the customer deserves to be treated like absolute shit. Every night my family and I have tried to eat here, we've been given rude, racist, snobby girls who are so cruel to my mother because of her accent (she is Japanese) or who practically shove our orders into our hands with a snappy \"here.\" ... Sometimes we don't even get any service! We'll sit there for 10-15 minutes and nothing happens. They blatantly ignore us obviously. Okay! Thanks. That's totally how you should treat someone. Overall, don't go to this Sonic at night unless you want to feel bad about yourself and get super frustrated."}
{"text":"I found Sonic to be an underwhelming fast food restaurant. I had never had Sonic before since it wasn't in Northeast Ohio until this location opened last fall. We decided to have lunch here over the weekend since we had never tried it before. The set-up is nice, you can either sit at an outdoor table or sit in your car where you can phone in your order through a speaker phone built into the menu. You also pay at your parking spot with a credit or debit card. The food is brought over fast by a waiter/waitress in roller blades. The food was mediocre. I had a cheeseburger with everything with a regular order of fries on the side. It didn't taste horrible, but it wasn't spectacular in any way. Add in the horrible health effects of the mediocre food, and I find no reason to come back here. Overall, while Sonic isn't terrible, there are definitely better fast food options."}
{"text":"So, after a movie we decided to come and get a late night slush. We got there and they weren't letting customers order from the stall, so we moved to the drive thru. We were told the ice cream machine was freezing and it'll be 5-10 mins. We decided we could be patient enough, well 45 mins later (from the time I got in the drive thru line and when I drove away) we finally got our order. 

A week later, we decided maybe it was a one time type of incident. Well NOPE! This time it seems everyone was on break and no one to help. It took about 25 mins to order and receive our slushes. This will probably not be a place to take my kids to again."}
{"text":"Let me ask you this, have you ever had breakfast, lunch and dinner at the same restaurant in the same day?

Usually I stray away from reviews of places we're all familiar with, but today I thought I would give the Sonic some l-o-v-e.  Especially since, I ate at the same Sonic three (tres, 3, iii) times today.

For breakfast I got the Bistro Sandwich with Bacon, Egg and Cheese. I usually toss one of the buns and have it open faced. I don't want to appear gluttonous. :P

For lunch, a Wacky Pack with a hamburger, tots and a small iced tea. The prize was a plastic bug catcher.

For dinner, I had a hot fudge sundae and tots.

Hey, I've gotta go, I hear they have .99 root beer floats till midnight."}
{"text":"giving it 5 stars for same reasons as others before: sonic is open 24 hours, convenient location, i experienced super friendly service, and the food was pretty fresh even at 230am. all in all, its decent quality fast-food that sure hits the spot afterhours."}
{"text":"We stopped by this location around 9:25 pm, for a light meal. We ordered one sandwich, an order or fries, popcorn chicken, and ice cream. We sat talking in the car for awhile, and around 9:40 we realized it had been quite a long time. No one came to talk to us or even to take our money until 10 pm. That's right, it took over half an hour for four items. When we received our food, it was cold and the fries were half full. I asked the server to at least bring us some hot food as we had been waiting almost 40 minutes. All she offered was an apology and my ice cream (with no spoon) while she ran back for hot food. I expected at least more acknowledgment of our inconvenience, something. This was the most ridiculous service I've ever had, and having worked fast food for 8 years I feel that I am very understanding about mishaps and service problems. I will never return here."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a few years. It was so refreshing to order at the drive-thru and actually have the person on the other end, hear me and I could hear her very clearly! Friendly service, and the kids were satisfied with their food. I'll be going back !"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for several yrs. Many dinners and lunches from here when my kids were in school. Now its an empty nest but I still like a hot dog or hamburger so I get there every week or so. I found that this location offered a senior discount a couple of yrs ago, so as I am over 60 I took advantage of it. Until today, I asked for the discount and was informed that this location has never offered it. I am not experiencing any dementia or senile issues to have totally fabricating getting the discount for the past 2 yrs to all of the sudden the have never offered it. I guess its time to go to the sonic on tbird, they give the discount. Food was as good as always. The being told they never offered a discount to seniors absolutely sucked."}
{"text":"This used to be one of the better Sonics for shakes and slushes. Unfortunately over the last 2 years, they have continued on a downward spiral. Most of the time, they serve soupy shakes and varying degrees of good service or poor attitude - which essentially sums up teenagers."}
{"text":"Every time I go here they're always \"out\" of bananas. All I want is a chocolate banana shake. Not only are they always \"out\" they don't know when they get bananas, or just ignore me. Terrible service as I might add, always getting the order wrong!"}
{"text":"You need to fire the new people y'all hired on cuz they obviously have no freaking clue what the hell they're doing!! It's not enough that I can't get ice but now I only get carbonated water???? Y'all suck!!"}
{"text":"Service is usually fast food is great and i can never get enough of there drinks there's so many choices that i get blown away everytime."}
{"text":"I loved it, the food was amazing and was more than I expected. My food came out fast and the carhops were very professional. Great service overall"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Impatient and extremely rude! Employees rushed through order which in turn, made the process even longer. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Rude as heck. Lost a customer. All because their customer service sucks. All we wanted was cones for the family but the service was horrible and uninviting. Ended up with one cone with no toppings because they claimed that's the way they are served. Never going back."}
{"text":"Literally waited in the drive thru line for an hour... We ordered mozzarella sticks and once we finally got to the window the lady tells us they ran out of them. Terrible service. Terrible"}
{"text":"They have great friendly managers here and an awesome owner who is always ready to help. Every time I've been here, the response time to get my food out has been quick. And the employees are superb. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great staff...very friendly and helpful. 
The burgers are great and so are their breakfasts.
Tater tots -  yum!
A fun place to go in and eat or just drive through."}
{"text":"I was hoping for so much for.  The Sonic burgers were ok, nothing special or tasty.  The fries were lukewarm unsalted and undesirable.  The onion rings were hot but very greasy and also undesirable.  I feel like it was a mediocre meal and if I go back it will only be for ice cream.

I can say the staff who brought our meal was very pleasant and friendly the reason that I gave them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Sonic's food gets 5 stars, pretty typical place. But I had to write this because I've never had an employee complain as much to me as this bish did last night. My boyfriend and I come up to the window (he is driving) and we got two seperate orders. He asks her in the window How are you? and she responds \"I've been better trust me.\" ...a normal response, I would have said the same thing. Then she starts ranting about how terrible the customer was before us. Meanwhile, my jealous ass is getting annoyed because she keeps going on and on about her issues to my significant. She gives him his order and says \"Have a nice night, better than I'm having.\" and we were like uhhh we had another order (just a shake). So she gets the shake finally, and when she hands it to us she goes \"UGH I'm so pissed that it's raining! I just got my car washed today!\" I couldnt wait to drive away from this whiney bish. I'll be back because I love them mofo'kn master blasts, but I hope this whiner tells me less about her life. haha"}
{"text":"We sat in the carhop parking waiting for our order for 20 minutes only for them to come out once our food was done telling us their card machine was down and if we had cash. We didn't, so we sat out here waiting all that time just to not even get our food. It would have been nice to be told from the beginning that it was down to not have our time wasted."}
{"text":"They served me a shriveled up, dried out, nasty excuse for hotdog.  Then when I contacted them they had me fill out a survey. No recompense for the crappy food. Absolutely no customer service. They couldn't have cared less."}
{"text":"Took about 20 minutes to get three extra large drinks and mozzarella sticks. The total was $13.60. I have him $13.75 no change and no straws. Worst service ever and the layout is weird. Not efficient. Had to get out of the car to get our straws and never received change. Won't be going back!!!"}
{"text":"I never expect too much from sonic, but if you order a burger on toast the bread should at least actually be toasted. It was soggy and gross. Likely won't come back to this location."}
{"text":"Uhm. I hate it when I have a limited time for my lunch break and they get my food wrong....GRRR."}
{"text":"It's the last day of summer and yesterday I ate NOTHING, so i was pretty hungry. Unfortunately,  I decided to go here and get a chicken strip sandwhich. When i got it, I was confused. The chicken strips were the side of my pinky! And as wide as my pinky too. That sandwich was so sad that i kind of teared up."}
{"text":"This is coming from someone who I assure you is extremely patient. 
Went today and it will be my last. About 3 weeks ago I was waiting in the drive through  to surprise my husband with his favorite $3.00 cup of ice with the .00005 ounce serving of cherry/lime flavoring. After waiting in line for several minutes without even an acknowledgment and the building traffic jam behind me I pulled away.
Today my husband was thirsty so once again I found myself in the Sonic drive through and once again I found myself waiting and waiting. The only difference- I was the second car behind the car that hadn't been acknowledged. \"Sorry hubby\" and away we go. 
After completing the errands and the flavored ice craving still lurking, my husband wants to try again. Ok- short wait ordering at drive through - order some food and two route 44 drinks (this ensures there is something to sip on while the 42 ounces of ice melts). I paid.  Distracted from the overfill and unsuccessful attempt to keep from spilling on my white shirt, I place set cups down and drive away. I go to pick up the drink-are you serious? We've got 32 ounces.
 I dig around for my receipt when my husband reminds me I never got one.  Could I have gone back? Yes but I refuse. Dramatic for fast food, you betcha but it's more than that. It's your job. I don't care what your job is, you should do it right. 

Maybe I should be suspect because apparently Sonic thinks their commercials are doing their job. Then again if their job is to make Sonic memorable for the most irritating people in commercials, I guess that part is working.

On the plus side, thank you for saving me $ I won't be spending on your ice any more!"}
{"text":"I like Sonic, but it is expensive compared to other places. I usually go for drinks during happy hour (2-4 pm). Strawberry fruit slush and cherry limeade are my favorites. My kids like to add things to make their own. Dr. Pepper with vanilla and cherry slush with vanilla are surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Awesome. Love the slush. Love the onion rings. Always fast. Always affordable. 


Perfect for this Arizona heat! 

They even have a free slush opportunity if you download the app!!! 


Woop woop!

Oh and get some pop rocks in your slush it's BOMB!!"}
{"text":"No No No No No NO! I've eaten here twice. Once when I was drunk (anything tastes like prime rib when you're drunk, especially soggy greasy food). So we'll talk about my sober service. Whatever, the food is typical for a fast food restaurant. They have burgers, dogs, tots, and salads for the whacko's that are willing to pay a fast food joint to make your salad. The people rolling out on skates are friendly, nothing special other than their footwear. So yeah, my brother and I eat our food. No sooner do we roll towards Wendy's to turn out on Broadview does he tell me to pull over and stop because he doesn't feel well. Long story short, we both hurled right infront of Marc's because the food didn't settle well at all. I later found out why when I met a girl at school who used to work there for a while .She explained how the people in the kitchen are jerks. (You've seen \"Waiting\" right?) Yeah, picture that in the Sonic food prep area. Nasty. I will never ever ever be back!"}
{"text":"Worst Sonic!!!
It's run by a bunch of kids that have no clue and no supervision! I wasn't sure who worked there and who didn't because no one had a uniform on. 
The cashier asked me what I wanted and I said, \"#2 with everything\". 
She gave me a \"#3\" with lettuce and tomato...
Then my onion rings were golden on the outside and raw on the inside!
Last time going there!"}
{"text":"Please take a minute to look at your process. You evidently need to revamp how orders come out. I waited 8 minutes for one drink. I use to come to your establishment at least every other day for a drink. If the drive through has eight cars in line and I am still waiting after the 10th car goes through the line this to me is an issue with the way your business is run. Managers/owners need to get out from behind the counter/desk and come outside to help! After 8 years of coming to this establishment I will not be back. I do have a choice - do you to lose at least one customer!"}
{"text":"Sonic is great for their variations of shakes, but not their food. Way too greasy. Don't order the chicken club sandwich. B/c of the thickness of the chicken it never was cooked all the way thru. I sent it back & was given a different chicken patty that was supposedly thinner, huh? Nonetheless, just don't order their chicken sandwiches, your gut will appreciate it."}
{"text":"So... Not only could we NOT use the stalls to order, but they were cleaning the grill! Seriously wtf?! Put a sign up at the drive thru menu board to let people know you're cleaning the grill so limited menu is available! Epic fail"}
{"text":"My husband that wears hearing aids went to surprise me & bring home breakfast. He got out of the car & went to the patio.  He push button & tried to order but could not hear the lady. He asked if the lady could come outside. Since he was on the patio close to the door he did not think it would be any trouble. The lady said \"come back with someone that can hear\". I am so angry. I will never go to Sonic again."}
{"text":"This may seem petty, but will Sonic remove Sweet Tea from the menu?! It's like gambling with taste buds. Every time we order Sweet Tea we have to taste it first to make sure.  80% of the time, it's unsweetened tea or tasteless tea with a pile of sugar on the ice. It's frustrating. Except for that, get that intercom fixed in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Love the mozzarella sticks. Hate the service. I specifically ordered 16 mozzarella sticks (twice) and they handed me a 6 piece. Then the drive thru window was open and you can hear the employees curse at each other, because some one messed up the order. The cashier was trying to tell me how much extra it was going to be and she said \"it's going to be $5.18 duh\". What happened to being professional in a work place?"}
{"text":"Started our Sonic experience this evening at 7:30pm, attempted to order a heath concrete mixer, was told they were out of heath. Ordered two mixers and a small vanilla ice cream. We waited, waited and waited until 25 minutes later my husband went to ask about our order and was told they are short staffed. They handed him our ice cream and he asked for spoons...THEY WERE OUT OF SPOONS! My husband expressed, \"you have to be flippin' kidding me, half of what you do has a spoon in it!\"  Seriously, Mr. Sonic himself would of been disappointed with lack of menu items, the WAIT and NO SPOONS. It's simple really, put someone in charge, wait should never be more than 5 minutes, check your inventory and make sure you have SPOONS :)"}
{"text":"Second time I go there and they mess up my order....asked for no onions on burger and got onions again....the sticker for no onion is even on there....bread was stale and quite frankly when I called to complain no one answered there phone....is rather pay at another place for better service and quality.."}
{"text":"the food is fine, but the drive thru service was a 20 minute wait...that's unacceptable for me. To top it off the lady at the window was friendly, though did not apologize for The wait, which tells me this is normal for them."}
{"text":"Zero stars! Snotty employees brought out our food missing the child meal. One burger was undercooked, the other was incorrect. They also brought us cold tater tots. They brought me out my \"correct\" burger that had only a single patty when I had ordered a double. Tired of calling them on the intercom, I just ate it. About to leave, some nerdy older white man came out and asked if the food was okay. I told him not really, and I told him about the single patty. He said that he \"stood there and watched them make it, and it was a double\". I told him I opened the burger up to make sure it didn't have mayonnaise on it this time and there was only one piece of meat inside it. He continued lying to my face, because he didn't want to admit he got caught lying. Piece of shit."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, extremely slow. Girl working the drive thru 6/14/17 830 at night should be fired. Worst attitude and I heard the car in front of us call her a 'b*tch' and I had to agree. She was awful! I don't know how it was so slow with only 3 other cars there. Definitely won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I just went here to get a shake and waited like 15 minutes in the drive thru. They messed up my order by putting hot fudge so when I got my shake it was like nuke warm. This was a horrible disappointment!!! Will never be going to this one again!"}
{"text":"They have the best drinks.  I love the fresh fruits and amazing variety . And during happy hour not only are they half of they have .99$  corn dogs onion rings and mozzarella sticks!   

Great place to stop before a Long drive"}
{"text":"The absolute worst place to go. Went by there on 2-16 to pick up dinner quick, wrong idea. Placing the order I was told to get a strawberry lemonade I would have to get that in two cups since they could not combine coke and lemonade in the same cup . After repeating my order three times she understood what I asked for is on their menu board. While waiting the first twenty five minutes. Three orders that belonged to other guests were brought out to me and asked if they were my order. The fourth try they had mine minus my onion rings which my server assured me were there. After inspecting my order they indeed were not. Informed my server they were missing and was told he would get them. Another twenty minutes as other customers have come and gone still no onion rings. I catch another server and tell him I have been here for forty five minutes waiting for my order to be completed, he asked to see my receipt, guess what else my first server failed to give me. At this point I am ready to lose it with this establishment. After one hour plus had my order and was asked if there was anything else. They refused to remake my now cold order. Very poorly handled by their so called management staff."}
{"text":"Sonic is decent at best, saddening at worst. Their burgers are alright and their various beverages are certainly tasty at times, but do not even bother with their breakfast food. I got the Toaster, which is bacon or sausage, egg, and cheese on toast, and I found it incredibly depressing. The toast had the texture of moist bread, the eggs were a rubbery nightmare, and the bacon had no crunch. On top of that, the whole thing tasted like it was made of poster board. All in all, I think that Sonic needs to upgrade or overhaul or something, because I don't enjoy bland and poorly prepared food."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Sonic in a lifetime but my kids wanted to go. You know what they say. When in Rome give yourself colon cancer. We all had hot dogs. They are filled with 100% pure beef and at least 15% despair. I know that's 115% but I've never been great at math. You know what I will be great at after that meal? Pooping that's what. Every combo with a chili dog in it should be called the \"Number 2 combo\". Yeah...I know I'm gross. 

The dogs were ok at best. The people working looked like they were miserable. Sunday must not be fun day at Sonic..."}
{"text":"Horrible service and soggy burger. Decided to try it and never again. The server was in a rush dropped mints in our car and pretty much threw our food at us. Seemed very nervous to even talk we couldn't even hear him. My husband actually was asking him the order to which he was holding. Also the credit card swipe wasn't working and asked to pay twice it was like he didn't even hear us..."}
{"text":"The food was really quick. The employee was very nice. However, the food is a tad bit salty for my taste buds. I guess the abundance of drinks makes up for that though. They have a very large and good selection of beverages."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered Blasts through the drive-thru and were horrified by the unhygienic things we saw. While we were waiting at the window, we could see them making our desserts. One young man got whipped cream on his finger and then licked it off. He then for some reason used his fingers to flatten the whipped cream (I am guessing so the toppings would stay on). While making my husbands dessert, another young man grabbed a handful of toppings with his bare hand and put it into the Blast. I am sure this type of stuff happens at most restaurants but it is different when you see it happen. I was so grossed out by this experience that I will not be returning."}
{"text":"If they happen to get your order right, the food is always served cold. The cheese is never melted onto the burgers. They only seem to get drinks right. Won't be eating there anymore"}
{"text":"Amazingly slow, so I decided to walk to the window to what is taking 20min... Once you see the inside, suddenly you are not hungry anymore..."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 kids meals with cheese burgers. No pickles, no mustard. A chicken club, light mayo with bbq, and jalapeños in a meal with onion rings and cherry limeade. Texas toaster with large tot and large Limeade. Repeated everything twice to be clear in the order. Did not receive one of the cherry limeades, the cheese burgers had pickles and mustard, the large tot was a medium, one of the kids meals had tots instead of fries, chicken club did not have bbq sauce and large amount of mayo and they gave us a kids meal we didn't order. Sent back the kids cheese burgers brought them back with just mustard and pickles (specifically asked to hold the mustard and pickles). Took a long time and we needed to get some place so we took the cheeseburgers and wiped off the mustard. It's frustrating to spend the money, wait, and still not get our order right."}
{"text":"Every time I visit this Sonic, I am lucky at best if I get barely warm food, even luckier if it's correct.  And this Sonic can't make change for basic bills such as a $20, a $5 or a $10.  Standard payment bills and I have to wait while they go back for change as my barely warm food becomes less warm."}
{"text":"Went to get a shake and requested no whip cream. The lady comes out and it has whip cream on it. She catches it before I could say anything so she said she'll be right back out. She comes back in no time at all. The surprising speed was due to the fact that she just scraped off the whipped cream... poorly I might ad. Apparently actually putting effort into fixing the shake was too much to ask."}
{"text":"This is a great location, with great customer service. The food is exactly what you should expect from Sonic, and very consistent, as are the beverages. Their outdoor seating is usually not occupied, so it's a great and cheap place to just swing by and grab some food and chill out for a few."}
{"text":"Place was great! Not too busy. Went and grabbed dinner for five at 5PM and was in and out in 5 min. Not bad!!"}
{"text":"Sonic is one of the worst fast food places around. I don't really like anything on the menu, but damn if the branding always makes me want to stop when I drive by. I love the idea of carhops and 50's hamburgers, however, as I mentioned above I always leave thinking, \"Wow, that was really nasty and now I feel sick\"."}
{"text":"My first sonic experience some time ago and It was great.  I really like the ice in there drinks lol I know it sounds stupid but it's crushed and awesome lol"}
{"text":"Gotta have sonic's when your in Vegas! Great and fast service. I had the chicken tender combo and Oreo shake. So yummy! This combo was huge I couldn't finish."}
{"text":"They completely messed up our order. They didn't fully mix the ice cream slush. We ordered a burger with no cheese tomato or onion. Well they pit cheese on the burger. Then they made a new one with no cheese but put onions and tomatoes on it then forgot to give us our fries so we told them he asked what size we told him medium and they gave us a small and on top of it all it took 20 mins to get the first burger and we waited for our food a total of 50 mins"}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick lunch for the family. I tried the chili cheese tots and pomegranate hibiscus tea. Tots were kind of salty but still good. Tea was a little too sweet for my taste (almost tasted like a lipton raspberry tea) so I'll probably try the mango next time. 

Kids wanted oreo and m&m blasts. Good size at an affordable price. 

Overall, service was pleasant and fast. They were kind of busy but food still arrived at a reasonable time and the location isn't too noisy. Good place to take my kids. They love it and we'll probably be back real soon."}
{"text":"Extremely SLOW! I should just back out and leave!  What horrible service. How does this place stay open? Is it a franchise location? I won't be back"}
{"text":"Very friendly and accommodating! Spencer and Junah were great! Thanks guys! I am a very picky eater and quite often request substitutions or modifications on my order but Spencer was very nice and patient about it!"}
{"text":"No inside facilities requested my bacon to be grilled with my onions and did not enter my exact verbatim they sprinkled cold bacon on top sonic needs to slow down and get the order correct quantity is not better than Quality sometimes being very fair it's not a good thing because he can get the order incorrectly and it is not good for customer service for next time sonic please let's try to be accurate as well as fast we would really appreciate it thank you very much have a supersonic day oh and by the way the tater tots were also  cold"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. The past 3 or more times I have been there has been nothing but disappointment. Honestly it should be zero star rating. One of the times I was there, I sat and waited for my order to be taken for more than 7 minutes, when there was only one car in front of me. And while I was waiting during that time, 4, yes 4, employees walked over from the near by walgreens having a jolly good time apparently. I ended up driving off and not ordering because they would not take my order! The most recent time, I went to get a lemon berry slush. When at the window, I saw a girl put in a couple strawberries, put on the lid and shake it twice. As soon as it was handed to me I looked at it and immediately asked for it to be stirred up more because obviously from the complete white showing through the lid, it had not been mixed at all. The girl looked at me like I was crazy, closed the window, handed it to someone else, and then 3 employees proceeded to giggle and trade glances at me. They handed it back after a few seconds and big shock it looked the same. It's called a slush, not sugar water with strawberries on the side. 
Again. Horrible service. 
Normally sonic is one of my favorite places to go, but sadly I will not ever be returning to this location or maybe any sonic location again. 
And it's not just me, every person I know that has gone there has had similar experiences."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today, food was up to sonic 's standards. It was VERY busy thought."}
{"text":"I used to come to this Sonic quite a bit, but they seemed to get slower each visit.  I hadn't been to this location for quite a while; not since my last drive-thru nightmare here (look under the tips).  I was in the area tonight and craving a pineapple malt, so I thought I'd give them another shot... Waited  in the drive-thru line 10 minutes without moving, and fled  - If you want Sonic in this area, save yourself time and drive to the one on Pecos and Flamingo... I guarantee the drive will still be shorter than the wait here.  I give it two stars, only because the food and malts are excellent here, once you finally get them; and the staff is usually pretty pleasant."}
{"text":"A SATURDAY AFTERNOON, THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE! WE DIDNT EVEN ORDER! We sat there for 25 minutes and didn't even get acknowledged. 12 cars in the parkinging lot and no one was getting service! Horrible!"}
{"text":"The burgers are good. 

Fresh tasting, cooked well, soft bun, not over stuffed with low quality lettuce, just a little, and finely chopped onions with perfectly melted cheese. 

I really like their burgers, onion rings, shakes, and tots. I've tried the strawberry cheesecake, banana cream pie shake, the caramel waffle cone, the coconut cream pie shake.

The double cheeseburger and the regular cheeseburger are good quality burgers. Big in size and made very well for a drive thru burger joint. Sometimes you have to wait about 3-5 mins, but its worth the wait for what you get. 

Its probably a bit pricier for some people per burger (around 3 for a regular, 4 for a double) but the burgers are bigger and thicker than your average burger, and in my opinion, one of the best burgers you can get for something quick. Superior to In N out ( I was surprised too!!)  and you get half off drinks (shakes after 8 pm, juices and other drinks from 2 pm to 5 pm) I don't think it gets much better than that.

I can get a medium , huge shake for about 3 bucks. Which is super cheap. Never had any issues with hair, rude employees, bones, or anything in my food, and I've been there probably about 8 times  if not more over the course of the new year (January-March)


Great onion rings too. Probably some of the best I've had :)"}
{"text":"Every time I come here they mess up my order. They always take forever, my foods always cold, and they all have bad customer service. They need a new manager or something because everyone is terrible there."}
{"text":"Cheeseburger was the worst one I have ever had from sonic. It was flat, bun was soggy, didn't have any condiments on the burger.  May never go back."}
{"text":"Hello....do they answer the phone ? The answer is no!
This sonic sucks. If they cannot answer their phone then why should I bother going there? Here's a message  to manager...hire better people, answer the phone...maybe there would be more customers."}
{"text":"Went to have a late lunch at this location. Ordered a Cheese Coney combo with a 44 oz diet coke. The staff was friendly, but the hot dog was over cooked. I didn't realize it was over cooked until I got home and took my first bite. Ended up going back to the restaurant to raise the issue. They offered to replace the Coney or refund my money for just the Coney since I didn't bring my soda and tots back. I will not be back at this location. Hot Dogs should not be served if they have been sitting on the burner long enough to burn."}
{"text":"It's Sonic and my kids love it. Their menu is varied and the slushes make it a plus. Close to the out of the way casino we usually stay at and don't want to bother with the buffets. Tonight the carhop was especially awesome! I didn't get his name, but my son spilled his drink all over my car and he was such a BIG help! Customer service was truly outstanding!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times, and frankly, I don't know why I keep wasting my time or money. One time (maybe three months ago) I waited in line for over thirty minutes for four milkshakes. And when they came out they were melted, not to mention there was only one other person in line. Since then I've been back twice. The last time I received a vanilla milkshake (I ordered chocolate caramel). They fixed it, and I just assumed it was a mistake. Then, yesterday, I ordered a milkshake (same kind) and received yet another vanilla milkshake with fudge and caramel remnants on the edges. This Sonic does not mix their shakes and they're pure vanilla. Not to mention the people working inside are quite sketchy. They bring their kids to work and everything, as well. I will not ever give this location my business again. And honestly, if you want a good shake head to Cook Out."}
{"text":"Got hooked on sonic ice cream in MO. Was excited to try it at home in PA. Ordered 4 ice cream treats. Service was slow, (same as MO.) But worse was that they charged us extra for extra chocolate sauce on something we didn't order and I'm not sure we even got. I ordered a turtle pecan blast.  Not sure what I got, but it didn't have any pecans. I went inside and told them and they made me another WITH pecans without a problem. Also pet peeve for all sonics I've visited is that the ice cream cups have ice cream all over the outside and you have to ask them to make a special trip to bring you napkins and by then your hands are all sticky anyway. I think I'm done with sonic for awhile."}
{"text":"These morons couldn't get a simple double cheeseburger, no onion, no tomato correct. Instead, single cheeseburger, lettuce, tomato, onion and JALEPENOS! SMH

if this is Americas drive thru, we're f#%ked!"}
{"text":"Very rude service and the order was wrong. By the time I was done ordering I was just super irritated and it takes a lot for that. I don't even care that the order wasn't right, I just hate when people are rude. Krystal was the name of the girl on the receipt. Young girl with a bad attitude."}
{"text":"As I'm writing this, I've been waiting for my food. The cashier explained they were short staffed - this doesn't seem to be a new thing for this location. I don't suggest coming here if you're looking for a fast hot meal, as you won't likely receive that sort of service. 

To the management - either spend the money to hire more people or train your workers how to actually get orders out. Horrible customer service - before I even had my food."}
{"text":"I came to the sonic on Arizona Ave with a simple vision in mind \"a bacon cheeseburger with tots.\" Seems like a simple request, right? Apparently not. First I pressed the red button and waited a good ten minutes before the small lady in the machine greeted me. Once I placed my order I waited another ten minutes for my food to arrive. Thank god when it was finally ready \"Rebecca\" brought it to me while flaunting her sub par blading skills. I mean at this point the burger would've needed to be phenomenal to offset this timely wait. However, it wasn't. It was the most average burger I've even met. I've grilled a better burger after indulging in 6 rum shots. But... If you love long waits and mediocre burgers this is the place for you."}
{"text":"We were served flat sodas, and foolishly asked them if them if they could remake them for us. However, when they brought us a second round of flat sodas we really enjoyed those...."}
{"text":"I go to this sonic every so often and have never had any problems until today. My boyfriend and I order the bogo wings, two 12 pieces, wanted one to be half honey bbq and half hot honey, they were out of honey bbq so we asked to do that half plain and have bbq dipping sauce on the side, the second twelve pieces as buffalo. Then we order a side of large French fries, a medium chocolate covered strawberry shake and a medium watermelon slush, she repeats the order back to us and all is good. We get our food and the guy gives me a strawberry shake and I told him I asked for a chocolate covered strawberry all he says is 'oh we are out of chocolate' and takes our credit card and goes swipe it. so the lady taking our order failed to mention that to us while ordering. We get home and have one 12 pc buffalo and one 6 pc hot honey and they gave us no straws for our drinks. We live too far to go back and correct it considering we just stopped at this location since it was on the way home."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Hit the button 5 times and finally had to go in and ask what was going on. The girl at the window looked at us and asked what i wanted. I replied \"i have been hitting the button for the past 15 min with no response\". Her response \"there is only myself and the cook here so we will get to you when we get to you\". Instead of taking 1 drive thru 1 pull up they took only the drive through! I have filed a complaint with Sonic directly, hopefully they go in and audit. Terrible service, under staffed, below avg food and a run down building. Looks like below franchise standards."}
{"text":"I walked inside and was met by a worker who asked if he could help me. I thought that was odd since it's a restaurant so obviously I'm there to eat.  No one was inside and all the tables had phones on them.  I was then informed that I would have to call in or text my order. They don't take orders at the tables even though a big neon sign is flashing \"Open\" in the window.

I noticed there was a drive through.  I don't eat in my car but decided to get a drink.  Never having been here, at the speaker I asked about the frozen lemonade with an add on.  There was a long pause.  Clearly the girl didn't know what I was talking about. She asked me to repeat myself, which I did to another long pause.  She did finally respond that I could get an add on, at which time I ordered blackberry. 

When the girl came out with my drink, I asked her how long this Sonic had been here.  She must have been the same one who took my order because she was totally confused.  She responded, \"How long have I been here\"?  I said, \"No, how long has this Sonic been here\"?  She actually asked me again if I was asking how long she had worked there.  I repeated my question again and she responded with, \"I have no idea.  I just started working here.\"

I pulled up to another worker standing in the drive through.  I noticed my lemonade with blackberry was very yellow with no blackberry flavor or color.  When I asked the young man about it he said the blackberry is sugar free so it has no color.  Seriously?  I then asked him how long the Sonic had been here and got the same response that he had no idea and had just started working there.

As I'm sitting here writing this review, I noticed several cars did go through the drive thru.  But not one person has gone into the restaurant.  It will be interesting to see how long this Sonic lasts utilizing this call in concept.  It definitely doesn't work for me.  When I'm hungry I like to go in, place my order and sit down at a table to eat.  I won't come back.  In fact, I'm even hungrier now than when I got here and going across the parking lot to a great BBQ place that I've been to many times and that does have people sitting in their restaurant."}
{"text":"This has got to honestly be the worst Sonic my husband and I have ever been to recently we went there for lunch and ordered two what I would consider are pretty simple drinks I wanted a cherry limeade he wanted a strawberry lemonade slush after repeating ourselves about 5 or 6 times we gave up and had lunch at a different sonic on Dobson and Guadalupe who had absolutely no problem taking the very same order. Though my husband still gave them a second try when he went to lunch with a coworker and pretty much the same thing happened he ordered the same drink it took them forever to figure out what it was and then his buddy orders a double burger and ends up with a single patty. Pretty frustrating"}
{"text":"Worst location. EVER! The order takers are the most ignorant imbeciles who are too busy playing with each other to listen to the customer's order. NEVER GOING BACK"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the number of bad reviews this location has!

I've been to this same location for years and years as I live .1 mile away.

I love to get the Blackberry Sweet Tea...

I go early in the morning on my way to work and order the spicy jumbo popcorn chicken. I'm glad they serve lunch at 6 am because I hate all things breakfast.

I bring my doggies there and they give them milkbones! How thoughtful...

Anyways, the shakes are great too! There's real fruit in them!

Sonic is an awesome place in general.... With happy hour and all.

5 stars."}
{"text":"I seen the commercials, I thought the place looked cool, very '50s burger place, you'd expect girls with roller skates bringing the food. The food wasn't spectacular, it was just burgers and fries, etc."}
{"text":"If I could have given it ZERO STARS I would This is by far the most disgusting sonic I have ever been to, I should have taken Pictures of the food they served me. It looked as if the corn dogs I ordered had sat so long on their wire rack that it was flat on one side and had the wire marks imprinted on the same side. All I can say is wow!! Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place. It isn't the first time I've had poor food here before but thought hey might have been a one time thing but nope same crappy food. However David was really nice when I ordered my food and was very polite about refunding my order which wasn't his fault, well hopefully he wasn't the one who made it."}
{"text":"The food is not that good for the prices they are charging.  Much better option is to go to Culvers.   Food is a lot better and cheaper too."}
{"text":"Five stars for a fast food place? Hell yea. This is pretty much the only fast food place (other than In-N-Out) that people actually like instead of eating at strictly for convenience. (That said, it's still fast food.)
You can either drive thru, order in your car, or eat outside on picnic style tables. The kids meals make for a great snack (who doesn't like a free toy?) and the coneys are ahead of their time as far as AZ is concerned.
The real killer, of course, is the huge variety of drinks, slushies, etc. If you go during happy hour you can get a whole crowd of people large drinks for just a couple of bucks.
Don't go expecting fantastic food, but do go in lieu of just about any other fast food place."}
{"text":"Had a Chicago dog and it was good. The only con is that my hotdog was cold bc of the toppings. The tots were great."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and they are always slow, but after my last visit I won't ever be going back. I went through the drive-thru at about 8pm, there were 3 cars ahead of me. I placed my order of a combo with a shake, boneless wings a medium shake and a small shake. The car in front of me gets to the window and they literally sat there for 13 minutes, the only item I saw them hand the car was a bag of ice! I finally get to the window, pay, get my order and after about a total of 25 minutes from start to finish, I drive away. I get home and realize they didn't give me the boneless wings and one of the shakes was wrong. So I called them letting them know their mistake and the girl on the phone told me to bring the receipt in and I could either get refunded for the wings and shake or I could get the food. I told her I would be back in the morning to get a refund. Next morning I give them the receipt and explain what happened and the girl working there didn't want to give me a refund, she said I could only get the food. I told her absolutely not, I spoke with an employee on the phone and they told me I could get the money back. Finally, after arguing and getting the manager involved I got my money back. Nobody ever apologized for the incident. Rude and incompetent."}
{"text":"Lights were out at this location on the menus, it was a struggle to read the menu. Ordered a chicken strip dinner, once home I had 3 small pieces of chicken. By far NOT strips, I took pictures to illustrate the size compared to a tater tot. Once I took a bite it was apparent it was mostly breading and a small amount of chicken."}
{"text":"I've been there twice in the last week and both times the food has been really bad. I don't normally like to give bad reviews, but on the one visit my burger was crunchy (I.e. it must have been sitting around a long time) and on another visit I swear the strawberry limeade gave me the runs. The customer service has been okay but not the food. I'll be avoiding this sonic in the future."}
{"text":"Ok, so if you order a chili dog, to me you shouldn't see more dog than chili! Please!"}
{"text":"My favorites are the onion rings and lemon berry slush.  This has been my go-to for over 16 years.

The servers deliver the food on skates-love it."}
{"text":"Everyone here is friendly. And always get the order right. Great place to take the kids for a dessert and hang out!"}
{"text":"Always tasty. Try a java chiller in mocha or caramel."}
{"text":"Go for happy hour and try out a tasty beverage. I'm a vegetarian so I never get a burger. But its still most definitely worth a trip when you're craving a cold treat!"}
{"text":"Always atleast a 20 min wait (no matter time) and Stale Bread --- I'm very disappointed for the amount of time I had to wait--- I wouldn't mind if it was FRESH fast food but my pretzel bun is ALWAYS Stale ---- Either Hire more people or build a larger work environment--- Warm Springs Sonic Sucks"}
{"text":"We ate here at 2AM so I don't know if it's cause of the drunken hunger that kicked in but damn, it was hella good!  The drawback was the drive through line was taking forever!  Probably fellow drunkards, LOL."}
{"text":"Really love sonic, especially for ice cream dates with my son.  Love this location, staff is friendly and they do t disappoint.  However,my 3 star review is because all the teens that feel that every other word needs to be an F-Bomb.  Seriously, my 3 year old doesnt need to hear that! Bummer, because I really do like sonic a lot!"}
{"text":"Been here a fewtimes.I like the variety of items but they are terrible about getting my order right. Now they do remake it but it is annoying having to go back. I would suggest trying a shake but check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"This Sonic is good. I means its Sonic people. You want a hamburger and tots this the place to go. I think Sonic in general has gotten better food choices. I always get their green chile cheeseburgers and they are great, greasy, and just what I want. Right now they have two can dine for $9.99. From chicken, to hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken strips, onion rings, ...classic American fast food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had such a bad experience here. After repeatedly pressing the button, getting hung up on, and having to call again, the server refused to split the bill and only accepted one card payment. His excuse was that he couldn't do it. Once we finally received our food, my girls cup was 3/4 of the way filled and made the rest up with whipped cream. As a side note, the server also had brought food to my car before we had even ordered. I will never return to this location again."}
{"text":"Went to this location today 7/14/15 and I placed my order. This would have been the second time the tried to DOUBLE charge me. I think this location has some sort of scam going on to boost the money in their pockets. The person was rather blunt and never repeated my order back to me. So then I waited for the box to allow me to swipe my bank card, finally it shows and I swiped. I showed approved and then showed printing receipt. I then waited for my order and when the kid came out he rambled off the order not saying the added lettuce and tomato I asked for on the kids meal. So I asked him if it had it and at first he said no and I told him I asked the guy for it. He then re-looked and said oh wait yeah it does. So he proceeded to hand me my order and then asked for the money. I said I ran the card. He proceeded to ague with me about and so I pulled up my bank account on my phone to show him that it was in fact processing on my account. He then said we'll I won't accept that. I then told him to go get his manager. He walked away for about 3-5 minutes, then came back and said the manager told him to just give it to me to not worry about it. So the manager at the time of 6:13pm would NOT come out and talk to me. This location is a freaking joke. Half the time they can't get my order right."}
{"text":"Great service. Had a girl named nazaria. But the wait was incredibly long. Pricing is ok but it's definitely not a place to go for food. But if you want a quick creat it yourself drink this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Thank you Sonic especially the young lady who took my order, I have not been here in such a long time because you guys are so far from my house. How ever she brought it to my attention the name of the burger I had many years ago was called the \"Island Fire \" !!! It is not shown on the menu but boy I tell you it is sooooo good! It's a burger with a sweet habenero sauce. The burger I had today was so fresh you can even taste the beef patty in the midst of all the other textures and flavors of the burger. 

Now you know that's when you have a good burger! I love how the bun has a slight oil sheen on top and the bun is toasted just right with golden greasy edges that I like!

Thank you sonic for satisfying my appetite!
Money well spent!

Ooooohhh yea the ladies that worked there were very friendly and smiling the whole time."}
{"text":"I received a vanilla brownie Sunday instead of chocolate. Second time my order has been screwed up or they have forgotten something."}
{"text":"The service is terrible!!!!! The people that work the drive thru are so rude!!!! They mess up your order and then when you say something they get an attitude.  Just awful!!! I will never go there again!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to find a Sonic on our trip. Our excitement promptly faded when it took over 20 minutes to get our food. When it came, my Honey Mustard and Swiss Chicken Club sandwich was wrong. They had given me a Chicken Club Toaster. Not the same sandwich at all, one has a cibatta roll and swiss cheese AND bacon, the other is on Texas toast with American cheese. The runner went back in to get the manager (not sure why they couldn't just fix it). The manager came out with total attitude saying that she would fix it, but she just wanted to inform us that the chicken clubs are made on toast. Really, because your menu says otherwise dumbass. So, after another hefty waiting period, they brought out the correct sandwich. Best part, they used the exact same  sandwich from the first order, tore off the american cheese and slapped an un melted piece of swiss onto it and tossed it on onto  a cibatta roll. Left out the bacon, which I might add is the most serious offense of the whole freakin' experience. By the time it was actually in my hands, my family had finished eating and my sandwich was ice cold.

But wait, there's more.  To my hubby's dismay, his cherry limeade was missing their signature limes in the cup. Fail. Epic fail. 

At least the tots were good."}
{"text":"Worst drive thru in business. It's close to my house so every time I think, maybe they ll get it right this time, but no. I asked for no mayo on my burger, even repeated it to the guy at the window and he assured me there was none. Of course it was covered. Tots were cold as lets not even go there with the French fries. Worst fast food fries around. My boyfriend ordered a double bacon cheeseburger only meat and cheese and surprise surprise, no bacon! Never again!!"}
{"text":"If you are going through the Drive-Thru, be prepared to wait for a very long time before they even respond!!! Customer Service is terrible also!!!"}
{"text":"This is the least well run operation in all of Sonic's stores!  they lie, they play with customers shakes they do not observe health regulations for food handling.  DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION!"}
{"text":"If there was a -negative star I would use it.  Unhappy servers who looked like androids from that movie zombies retuning from the dead! Took a break from studying college math to get a root beer float. Purchase drove back home to savor and watch favorite tv drama and dang no root beer seltzer. Had to drive back for refund. No offer of making for free considering high gas prices and 2 trips. Went back a week ago with God daughter to get 2 milk shakes they were terrible. Whip cream was nasty and no choc in chocolate shakes. We had to remake and remove whip throw up cream and add Hershey to make it chocolate. Two thumbs down no Sonic for me!"}
{"text":"Place is great, same old sonic food. Half the place was closed for cleaning and the awesome girl allow us to sit there without a fight really awesome, thank you"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's not in the high rent district of Buckeye, but I think downtown Buckeye has an undeserved bad rep anyway.  There's a charm that I find missing in the bigger ratrace areas. There is a lot to be said when I can run to get milk at Circle K or Walgreens wearing my son's Slipknot t shirt and leggings with my hair in a frazzle because, YES, it's Buckeye...and we don't have to impress anybody! Boy did I digress.
Anyway my husband and I were picking up our car from Don Lalo's shop nearby and we brought the kids here to Sonic. How those cute girls get around on those skates with those trays of food, I don't know and give them a lot of credit. The burgers were great and cooked the way I like them, no gristle either (one bite of gristle, and that's all folks...I'm done. Yuk.) I love the crunchy golden tater tots, probably not the healthiest thing in the world to eat but they are delish. My son had a vanilla milkshake that looked wonderful, it must have been good because he wasn't sharing. We sat outside in the gorgeous March afternoon, and while there isn't much by way of scenery, it reminded me of the old time drive-ins I went to as a child in CA. The only thing that wasn't too great was that the drive thru is situated where you get a blast of exhaust fumes if you are sitting in the patio area. But nonetheless, whenever we are in the area, it's a nice little place to stop by. Probably best that we live on the other side of Buckeye, as those tater tots and Cherry-limeade would become a daily craving."}
{"text":"Triple repeated a simple 2 person order. Couldn't handle it. Why cant they make a simple ketchup & lettuce only burger? Theres pickles & onions everywhere!!!! Asked if we wanted ranch, yes please, got none."}
{"text":"Why do I even bother.. I am currently sitting in the drive thru, in the same place I've been sitting for 30 minutes. I have half a mind to just eat the $7 I spent and drive away. There is a boy literally standing at the window with his back to me right at this second. An update would be nice, little one."}
{"text":"I've been to Sonic Drive-Ins on both coasts of this country, so we expected the same good service and food. We went twice during our visit, and ordered RT44 Strawberry Limeades and the first time got one lime wedge each, so the second time I ordered it with a few lime wedges...and they charged me for 'extra flavor' and I got TWO lime wedges in each RT44.  Other places we got about 5 wedges for a normal one. We also waited about 15 minutes in the heat. I'm not pleased."}
{"text":"We live close to this location and ask ourselves EVERY time we go, why we bother. From the long lines, slow and rude customer service and wrong orders, it's just not worth the hassle. For whatever reason, this place only employees incompetent and rude kids. I don't get it 

We are just going to drive farther and go to Cold Stone from now on. 

Avoid this location. It's a headache , EVERY time."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru this morning and got some attitude and eye rolling from the lady at the window. The food took a while and it was not all that great. I was expecting it to be really fresh considering I waited 15 minutes at the window. The customer service is horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. So. Slow. I am in the drive through as we speak. I've had time to go through my Facebook, Instagram, email and have time to spare. I'm literally just sitting here waiting. All I ordered was ice cream. Just waiting for the car ahead of me. It's been at least 15 minutes.  I actually was here earlier today for a kids meal. Took at least the same amount of time. So much for fast food."}
{"text":"The more and more I go to sonic the less and less I am impressed. First of all they didn't have any bananas for the shake that I wanted. Then I ordered a kids meal for my daughter thinking it was only $1.99 (promotion from 5-8pm) but apparently they stopped doing that. The grilled cheese sandwich was less grilled and more like just cheese and just bread. But she ate it and that was ok. She wouldn't eat the fries. Not sure why but they have had a different taste to them the last few times. And after all of that my strawberry limeade had no syrup in it and just had the sparkling water and a few strawberries. Couldn't even drink it. So I paid full price for crap."}
{"text":"Super slow. We arrived before the rush and waited 40 minutes minimum to get our food. By then we were one of the few cars still there. The girl brought out the food, forgot my chili and cheese French fries. Husband mentioned how long we had been waiting and the girl laughed and gave an insincere apology. Came back with my fries. We were both exhausted from the day so we went straight home. Where we discovered they messed up our burgers too. We asked for no onions on our burgers but after 40 minutes waiting for our food, we found a ton of onions.  I'm pregnant and CANNOT deal with onions not even the smell and completely lost my appetite. Beyond disappointed and will take my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"Monday night, service was extremely slow here. Don't frequent if your in a rush. Other sonics close by are far faster."}
{"text":"Rarely do I come sonic but only when i have coupons. The little kids they had working on the night of 9/23 were loud and disrespectful. I had to repeat my order 3 times stating i had a coupon. Only to have the child raise their voice at me like she was a man. Chick needs to learn some respect and listen to the order the first time instead of giggling and acting like a complete uneducated idiot. Never coming here again and nor will anyone i hang around with."}
{"text":"The food was good as always, but the woman behind the counter when I came in at 1 AM on the 29th really left a good impression on me. She was polite, she made sure to read the order out in a clear and concise manner, leaving nobroom for error. Great job!"}
{"text":"Sonic is consistently sonic. The only difference you'll get between sonics is the speed of service and drink mixing ability. This place is pretty good. But the lake mead location is better."}
{"text":"Indoor & Outdoor dining with drive in and drive threw type service.  Food is always good.  Never had slow service.  They have 1/2 off drinks between 2-4p"}
{"text":"Never had a problem until today with the service. Went through the drive thru at 8 pm on Tuesday night and the girl working the window was rude. When taking my husband's she couldn't hear and he was practically yelling out order. When he tried to order a hot dog she rudely responded with which one he wanted. I rarely ever write bad reviews but I hate when people are so rude and give bad service."}
{"text":"I was just at the drive thru and I had made an order for my family.  Everything seemed okay.  The window person was pleasant.  But as we opened our order at home we discovered a whole order missing.  Yes we I should have double checked the order but then again we trusted that we got what we ordered.  I then called their number and explained what had happened.  Instead of a courteous apology this person told that \"well she didn't ring you up for it that's why you didn't get it.  She partially rang it up...\".  I asked for a manager and this person TELLS me \"well I'm the manager!\".   So I ask is this the way you handle these problems you basically tell them to deal with it?  And the manager replies, \"yes\".  Such poor customer service....

{"text":"Worst sonic I've ever been to. The guy taking our order was beyond rude. He obviously didn't want to be there. We paid with a card but I didn't work when we tried if ourself so we waited and he was like you know you can do it yourself right here right.  To make it worse the food was cold and tasted old."}
{"text":"Service: A, quick and correct

Food: B+ , my Sonic burger was so-so but my fries were great!

Beverages: C, 3/4 ice- W T F !!,,,  HELLOOO- Vegas + Summer = 200deg temp! 

Desserts: A, my Oreo shake was just right, not too sweet or overwhelming,  just a perfect blend of Orea and milk shake.

Overall: hhmmm,,,,, 3.5"}
{"text":"Took my grand kids for first time at this location. Where I come from they skate, not here. Order took a long time, beef way undercooked, fries blah, chick strips not good. No one liked anything...server looked stoned."}
{"text":"I just got food from here, but wait, they never put my Coney dog in the bag.  But I paid for it! Also asked for banana in my shake but when it came out just plain vanilla! But my receipt shows otherwise. Really? What is wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"I went to a late lunch here today.  Great food and great carhops!  A reasonable value and quick service.  Unfortunately, it all comes with a large helping of rudeness from the person taking the orders.  You never see the person who takes your order which is a major weakness in their system.   Today that anonymity was taken advantage of by someone who decided to be abrasive and condenscending  So if you are really hungry and want a side order of crappy attitude and abuse with your lunch, this is the place for you. Personally, I'm going to give it some time because no business can succeed with an employee acting like this."}
{"text":"My favorite SONIC in town. There is one just down the street from here on Boulder, but this one never has a crowd, is consistently good with their drinks, and has a friendly staff. We go here almost daily for a Route 44 during the hot summer months. They sometimes close early at night, but around sunset is the perfect time to come to catch a nice view of the Strip."}
{"text":"I beleive his name is Juan, but let me tell you how rude he was. Rushed me to order, cut me off every time i talked, just terrible service. Never again will i return to this location."}
{"text":"LOVE me some SONIC! 

I was raised in New Mexico and Sonic is a staple there . Sonic is on the main street and EVERYONE goes to Sonic and hangs out. 

Here in Nevada ... well especially in Henderson you can usually see some classic car clubs that come and hang out.

Reminiscent of the 50's drive in that you see in movies . 

You sit at the order box - order - and a girl or guy on skates brings you your order. 

(is it wrong you look to see if they are gonna fall?)

Last night I was out late and didn't get to eat until late ... did I mention sonic stays open to midnite and later? 

I ordered  a Sonic Cheeseburger with mustard. A perfect tasty old fashioned hamburger -and a Dr. Pepper.  

Naughty confession :  If I am wanting a soda? I will drive out of my way for a soda at Sonic - the crushed ice makes it perfect everytime.  

They also have slushies - sundaes - salads- and many other appetizing foods. 

Just writing this I think I may have to go after work and hook me up with something Today!"}
{"text":"Worst experience at a sonic ever! Sat in drive thru (not the little pull-in areas, the actual drive thru) at the intercom waiting to give my order for over 5 minutes with absolutely no employees responding at all to the intercom to take our order. Apparently they were understaffed that day, or at least thats what the incredibly, rude manager said. I can understand long waits in drive thrus, but flat out ignoring customers while at the intercom giving their order? There's no excuse to warrant that."}

{"text":"CARLOS IS GREAT.  I park and order just to get him.  He always is smiling, makes sure your order is correct before he leaves, comes to ask you if you need anything (without being annoying) and makes the experience great!"}
{"text":"Usually for the most part this sonic is fair with their service but this night I wasn't so lucky, The drive threw server Bri not only got my order wrong twice when speaking to her then the manager came out and asked if I wanted a turtle pecan Sunday or the turtle cake Sunday I told him the turtle cake Sunday. That same server Bri was the one whom came to the car and delivered my food she goes on to tell me it's $13.56 when just before she told me it was $11.25.... And then as we are driving home we realized we never got our drink that comes with the meal that we ordered. All together this was just terrible service...."}
{"text":"Purchased 4 chicken sandwiches and all four were old and hard as a rock. I uploaded a video so you can see how hard, old and over cooked it was.  Had to feed it to the dog."}
{"text":"Orders are always inaccurate and/or just taste bad. Especially the slushies they never have enough flavor. At this location I recommend re-Training."}
{"text":"The service is consistently good. I don't usually expect that from fast food. I get very frustrated with most fast food places because they rarely get my order right and don't seem to care. I've given up on all other drive throughs in the area. I thought maybe my voice couldn't be clearly understood through a speaker or something but they always get it right here. It's always young people working but they are polite and efficient. Ive never had a long wait, an incorrect order, cold food, or poor service. Try saying that about any other fast food establishment. My hat is off to the manager here. I chose to eat in my car my last visit in because I had my pet with me. That gave me time to observe. The staff is young and thus without a lot of work experience but they were professional and efficient. I train and manage in the work place and understand the challenges of such an inexperienced team. This manager has everything running smoothly. I'm very impressed. Oh and the chocolate coke is sooo good!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this location less, definitely would. I ordered a large watermelon slush with jolly ranchers. It tasted amazing, then all of a sudden I taste something I should not be tasting.. PEANUT BUTTER. Which my 4 year old nephew is very allergic to. Thank goodness he hadn't yet taken a drink. I am so very furious and I will NEVER return to this location."}
{"text":"Tried orange slush with cream.  Wow. For summer, if you forget to take water, want a good drink then try this plz"}
{"text":"Extremely slow. Only 1 car in front of me in the drive thru, 0 behind me. Ordered 1 thing. Me and the other car were sitting there for over 15 min. The car infront of me had 1 small bag and a ice cream. The kids in there were messing around and started singing when I got to the window."}
{"text":"Stopped by before getting back on the road to S.F Great service. GReat drinks. Love the strawberry lemonade my fav! Ocean water is really good too!"}
{"text":"Do I begin with this review? I pulled up to the first available stall to place my order, press the button and there's no answer. I wait 30 seconds press the button again still no answer. I get out of my car and go to the patio to place my order on the machine there. Wasn't able to place my order there because there was a credit card stuck in the machine the wrong way. I get back into my car drive to the other side in another stall and press the button to place my order. Finally someone picked up and took my order. There I sit for more than 20 minutes waiting for my food. I watch the drive-through lane get completely helped and all of the people on the patio have their food. So I press the button and ask the person on the other end of the line when I'm going to get my order, they reply oh very shortly. I ask do you think it will be less than five minutes? They didn't answer because they had already disconnected. About five minutes later my food arrives. I asked the employee what took so long and they blamed it on all the other orders they had to fill. They did say they were sorry but offered nothing to compensate me for waiting almost my entire lunch hour for my food. I've had much better food at other sonics in the past, I will not be returning to this sonic again."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I heard Madison finally had a Sonic. I had never been before, but had always seen the ads for it on tv and thought their food looked good. I was very disappointed. There are only a limited amount of meals you can chose from. I got the crispy chicken sandwich and it tasted so bland. The onion rings and jalapeno poppers were bland too. The strawberry slushy was ok. The ocean water was ok. Needless to say not only was the food bland and disappointing, but normally I never get stomach aches and after eating there I felt sick."}
{"text":"Hilarious that I'm the third Californian to review this Sonic's.  As it were, there just aren't any here for us to go to!  

While I've been the ONE i've found in SoCal (Anaheim), this one was quicker and had twice as many places to park.  It also had a drive-up one... well, it seemed like a normal drive in. People left instead of eating in their cars.  Anyways, you guys all know how it works.  Push the magical red button, order to your hearts content (GET A CHERRY LIMEADE!), and anxiously await.  There are no skates, though there was a guy who had a tray of extra napkins, ketchup, etc who walked around.  Nice touch Scottsdale.

I always get a hamburger with mayo.  I was drunk the first time I had it and thought it was the best thing I had ever eaten.  Now that I've eaten it while sober, I still think it's pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Altough they have pretty good shake here, their customer service is pretty horrible.  We waited for our food for at least 20 minutes.  There were at most 3 customers including us."}
{"text":"The drive through person is always really cranky and angry right when you drive up. Poor service. All of the employees just suck and don't know what customer service is."}
{"text":"Came here for their boneless wings since they have been having that Wing Night in America promotion: Monday-Thursday 5pm-Close. I ordered the pineapple habanero, hot honey, honey bbq, and buffalo. All were hot and crispy except for the Buffalo weren't as crispy probably because the sauce is wetter. Overall pretty good. Pineapple habanero was the best one! Got 24 wings for $10!"}
{"text":"They server burgers for breakfast!  Full menu is available all day, which is a huge plus for me and anyone else who prefers a burger and fries over an egg muffin/bagel/croussant to start out the day.

I know that BK and JIB also do this, but these are superior burgers with fresh lettuce and tomatoes.  This place would rate 3 1/2 stars if that was an option. 

 I haven't tried the new hot dogs on the menu, but I have heard they are worth the price (a couple of bucks)."}
{"text":"Can't agree with Joanne's statement of \"you can never say one sonic is better than another sonic. They all taste the same\".

Being a New Yorker, I am often PISSED when I see the Sonic Commercials and then realize the closest one is an hour and a half drive from my house.  This means that when I have the opportunity to go to a Sonic, I do it.

This was the 4th Sonic I've ever visited (I went to one in NJ, PA, and Austin, TX before).  This was probably the worst one I've been to. Don't get me wrong, if you like Sonic you'll like this one, but it was subpar compared to the other ones.

The Texas Bacon Cheeseburger and Frito Chile Cheese Wrap were great, as usual. The onion rings tasted weird and were disappointing (I had them in Jersey a couple of months ago and they were excellent).  

Also, the people who work here aren't the brightest bulbs in the lamp.  I ordered a #5 with a frito chili cheese wrap and a diet coke and took them forever to figure out what was up."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this joint. Was in the neighborhood for work, and wanted a milkshake for the drive home. The server, Jessica, who provided me my milkshake, was very smart, polite, engaging, and I found her attentiveness very refreshing.  

The service I received restored my faith in young people."}
{"text":"Love the slushed here and the cherry limeade!!! The food is good too! I'm not really into burgers, but I've had their chicken strips and grill cheese and tator tots, so good! They are always pretty busy but it's usually no more than a 10 minute wait for food."}
{"text":"So today I bought a lemon berry slushie and there was a fly in it so it would have been great if i could have enjoyed what I paid money for but whatever throw a fly in there thats cool too."}
{"text":"Ice cream machine is always down. Food is cold half of the time, never have molten cakes. Horrible service. Last time I had cheese \"melted\" on my tater tots and it was whole. I don't know why I give this place a chance to prove me wrong every time, but im fed up. Had to write a review. Literally get better food and service at McDonald's on Ann and Simmons"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and do not go here. 25+ minutes waiting for a burger. 3 staff staff was down right disrespectful and rude. Wrong order. Overall bad experience management needs to get their frontline staff in check. Again do not go here."}
{"text":"Not so very good, and definitely not better than any big chain fast food. The fries had no flavor, O rings were strangely sweet (cornmealy?), burger was just \"meh\". Won't go back unless I need some frozen slushy high fructose."}
{"text":"It seems that this Sonic Drive-In is always givig away FREE stuff...
This Sonic after 5pm has a Mystery Stall game. If you pull into the winning stall you receive a FREE Sonic Blast!
Also thursday December 9, 2010 between 7pm - 9pm all customer can get a FREE Coke Zero."}
{"text":"Obsessed with their onion rings and cherry slushies. Love going there to just BS with my friends. Not a fan of their burgers anymore. Lately the buns have been frozen. Like literally the buns are frozen. Gross. So onion rings and cherry slushies is all I want from here. HAHAHA."}
{"text":"I really only give the burgers in this joint 3 or 4 stars, but the other items on the menu, make this place amazing. Such as:

#1 Tots.

#2 'Breakfast Bistro' sandwich. You CAN'T get a better fast food breakfast sandwich.  A large, super-soft bun, egg, meat, and cheese. Once you have it, your mouth will water every day you drive by Sonic in the morning.

#3 Quality commercials. The guy who wanted the 'last word' on his wife. You want some fries with that shake? They're all pretty funny.

#4 Coconut Cream Pie Shake. Bits of pie in a shake. Good as hell.

#5 Happy hour. Stop by and get a large Cherry-Limeade or Powerade Slush for 80 cents. You can't beat that."}
{"text":"Just sat in the drive-thru for 13min for 2 hotdogs and a breakfast burrito. No one in front of me, 4 cars behind me. Their speaker for the drive-thru sounded blown out and I couldn't understand a single word she said. After finally getting my food at the window she apologized for the speaker not working but didn't say anything about waiting that long for my food. Who the hell wants to wait that long for a couple of freakin hotdogs? No one does, sonic. No one. Giving 2 stars because the hotdogs still tasted good. But really anything would after the anticipation of waiting that long at a fast food chain I think."}
{"text":"This Sonic has the nicest staff! Very clean and pleasant dining area. The usual Sonic menu, which is a good range of fast food and beverages."}
{"text":"Can you say Chicago Hot Dog?  With the real banana peppers and a long pickle.  They are really good and worth the cook time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here on our way to a work call in Lake Las Vegas. We were trying to rush an go on with our day off so possibly could have been more irritable than normal however the service didn't help our moods. 
The woman working the drive thru was rude and impatient taking our order. She had the worst attitude and I could tell through a box! That's what prompted me to write this and it only got worse! At the window she charged our card not saying a word and handed us our items one at a time. There were very long gaps of time in between each beverage and the food. Every time she walked away she left the window open so we could hear them complaining (very loudly and animated) about having to cook the breakfast burrito at one pm....and jalapeño poppers. It was awkward, to say the least, when a new equally as rude employee returned with our food."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero I would. Waited 10 minutes with my husband after pushing button to place order tonight. 2 waiters looked right at us and did nothing. We pushed it again still no response. We left and went somewhere else. They only had 3 cars in the lot . Not that busy that they needed to ignor customers."}
{"text":"Love the drinks! While I'm not a huge fan of the food, I really like the tots and the drinks here. They have a lot of cool flavors and at good prices, and this location is very fast"}
{"text":"Super sonic cheeseburger!!!!! That is what you have to order. One of the best tasting fast food burgers I have ever had. The patties were seasoned really well, with the right amount of cheese. They also have slushes and shakes. Do not forget the lime-aids, very refreshing. You cannot go wrong with the frozen treats and sundaes here."}
{"text":"I stopped here today and went through the drive thru . Young kid didn't hear my order and I had to repeat it again .  Reese peanut butter blast , no whipped cream . No biggie . So I repeat the order again . Kid gives me my order and I mention I asked for no whipped cream so he makes it again and hands it to me .  I drive away only to realize it was a cup filled with plain vanilla ice cream .  I drive back and return it and ask for my money back . Which they do , but really after all that you think they would have tried to accommodate a dissatisfied customer little better for their messup !"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this sonic for YEARS without problems. They advertise a morning drink special between the hours of 8-10am. On a Tuesday I went and got a large ice coffee for $1.49 as part of their special.  On Thursday I go back and order the same thing. Different price. Lady named Darlene at the window informs me that they are no longer running the promotion- seems weird but I don't have time to argue as I was on my way to work. I come back that evening. Take a look at the menu. Special is still advertised. Speak with a rude gentleman who informs me they are no longer running the special and I'd have to come back in the morning to get a refund. I asked why it's still listed on the menu..\"because we haven't changed it ..\" I asked how was a customer supposed to know they aren't running the promotion if it's still listed on the menu \"...they tell you when you get to the window.\" I told him that was unacceptable and that they have to honor prices listed on the menu. He tells me I have to take it up with the morning crew. I ask for someone above him and a different guy comes back with a dollar and some change. Honestly it's just a dollar and cheap ass fast food but this has left such a bad taste in my mouth that I plan on contacting corporate and probably never going back again."}
{"text":"This was my go-to Sonic anytime I was craving it. Unfortunately I won't be eating here as of last night I went to buy some food and they rushed my order, I ended up getting food poisoning and so did my boyfriend from their chicken strips. I might return for the drinks only but as of now I probably won't ever eat here again."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 slushs. Got my total, drove up to the window to pay. Waited for 4 minutes and they opened the window to say \"we are out of slushes\" ugh, why couldnt they just tell me that to begin with"}
{"text":"Just ordered combo #11  dinner combo drive thru.  It's chicken strips, onion rings, hush puppies, and toast.  It was ridiculous!!!!  There's only 1 onion ring and the rest in the dinner box was hard as rocks.  I didn't checked my order before I left but I should have not trusted these kids.  Never again i will order at these place!  Wasted my money and had to throw the food.  This place just don't care!!!"}
{"text":"Juan my server gave me top notch service with a smile so I asked him to get the manager (Julian ) so I could tell him of my pleasant experience.  Also, I had a Fresh burger and onion rings for $2.99, I ordered a large drink which was half off (Happy Hour) unlike Mickey D's down the street that gives you old food when u get a discounted meal. I no longer go to that MD's.  I am now a Sonic fan when out for a burger. On top of that they gave me 2 free drink chips for use at a later date. Thank you Juan. Julian and Sonic, You take care of your customers and create loyalty."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here just before closing. Several homeless people setting up shop here. 

Food: Ordered a couple hot dogs and a basket of tots.

10 minutes after ordering: Grills broken, no hotdogs. 

We got the tots and sodas free of charge.

3 stars for the service. -1 for the homeless.

Tots were still good though."}
{"text":"The worst sonic everrrrrrr!!! I'm sitting in my car as I type this, I have been waiting for my food for 10 minutes now and mind you it's 10am on a Sunday snd there was only 1 car in front of me and now there is a line behind me.  The girl at the drive thru screwed up my order several times! I'm at the window now and she asks if I want some cream and sugar, so I asked for what and she says your coffee so again I had to remind her I ordered the sonic sunrise.... #justpitiful"}
{"text":"We waited 30 minutes for the bag of cold food.  They forgot the blast.  I ended up leaving without the 5 dollar blast.  I just called the corporate number to complain so I expect them to maul us a refund.  I'm not holding my breath though!  This drive in is in bad need of a manager.  I tried to call the manager with no answer....wtf.  We will never go back.....that's sad because my wife liked sonic.  They need to hire a manager."}
{"text":"Sonic burger... not even Mc Donalds quality.. that's bad... service via the drive thru???? Need I say more... well yes I do... NEVER AGAIN!!! have a nice day.."}
{"text":"If I could score lower I would. This sonic is the worst fast food I have ever been served. The hot dogs were literally grey and the skin was separating when I cut it in half. They serve old food and I'm certain if health inspection saw what the lazy employees served to customers they would shut this location down. My son ate his hot dog in the car and took one bite and noticed the color and said \"mom this smells bad and doesn't look right\" He got sick once we got home! I have called twice to report this to the manger, and as you'd expect with service so terrible not even a call to show concern for how careless the employees are."}
{"text":"Good service at 6am when I get my mini vanilla butterfinger custard concrete lmao what else can I say"}
{"text":"My NYE resolution was to stay away from fried foods. I tried, I really tried. That was until someone popped the question \"What do you want from Sonic?\"

It was a co-winkie-dink or maybe a sign from fate because I was looking at a Sonic coupon flyer (the ones you receive in the mail) and I was wondering what the burrito with the Frito's tasted like. Sign or no sign I was going to stick to my resolution. I responded, \"Nothing, but thank you for asking.\"

As Fate would have it, I received my utmost fave fried junk food in the WWW! A corndog. I scarfed that puppy down, chewed on the crunchy batter that is stuck to the stick in no time flat.

I *heart* Sonic's corn dogs!

PS - 2pm - 4pm it's happy hour! Drinks half off! Woo Hoo for the Cherry Lime-aide.

4 stars because they have great customer service!"}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience at this sonic. The service is so poor. Messed up our order multiple times. Triple charged us for one meal. Messed up my boyfriends Reese's concrete. TWICE. And even though we told them it was wrong both times they still messed up. The server girl had an attitude while dealing w us and we weren't being rude at all to her. In fact, we were nice while trying to get our order corrected. All in all this location sucks imo."}
{"text":"No attention to detail, salty fries/tots. I admit that they are fast. Just could use changes behind the grill"}
{"text":"I had never been to a Sonic before. I have seen the commercials on TV and have always wanted to try them. Finally got my chance when we were driving back to the airport, our last stop before leaving Las Vegas. 

We ordered our meal through the little speaker. The kid on roller skates!! came out with our food. Roller skates!!

I ordered a cheeseburger without the burger. However it came without the cheese as well. The vanilla shake I ordered was the highlight. My husband had one of their coffee shakes, I think that was better than mine. Definitely will order that one next time! 

Ugh, but man! It was SO hot, we couldn't eat our food in the car. And sitting outside wasn't any better either!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed! In the last couple of weeks we have been here 3 time and ordered the 
Supersonic Bacon Double Cheeseburger. It's the best fast food burger of it's time. It comes with a pile of shredded lettuce and 2 large sliced tomatoes, pickles and a little onion. We get ours with no spread (mayo, mustard, or ketchup).  It's fresh and has a great favor. This Sonic knows how to make great burger. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I always come to this sonic only because it is the only one close to my house. They take forever with my order every time and I always let it slide because there is a lot of people, but this time I'm super annoyed because we were the only car there and they still took ages to bring us our food. As I'm typing they still have not brought my things it's been 29 minutes for some tarot tots!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here. I ordered a foot long chili dog and an order of medium onion rings to go. When I got home I opened the bag. There were only 4 or 5 onion rings in the little bag. What a ripoff. I paid over  $7 for this garbage."}
{"text":"Do not go here. After a long wait in the drive thru, I got home and realized the \"cheeseburger\" I ordered was a bun with ketchup and mustard-they forgot to put the cheeseburger in the bun!!! I drove back to the drive thru, I explained the problem, and the guy said he would find someone to help. But after about 10 minutes, no one came to help. So I drove up to the window to again explain my problem. The guy barely said sorry and brought me a new meal. When I got home, I realized they'd forgotten the cheese on the cheeseburger.  And the fries package was approximately half full. Worst service I've experienced anyone in a long time."}
{"text":"Not only is this Sonic drive through slow, I went this morning and they didn't have coffee available at 7am. The girl in the drive through said \"I'm sorry, but the coffee machine says it's empty\". Ok how about making some more? She offered to get me another drink for free to which I politely declined. I'll go back because this is the closest Sonic to my work, but that's ridiculous."}
{"text":"Saturday I ordered a cheeseburger,  2pc poppers and onion rings.. Not only did I wait 10 minutes the fried food were as hard as rocks, and I was given a double cheeseburger and charged for a double cheeseburger and large poppers.  
Very unhappy!"}
{"text":"I don't really eat fast food but I have discovered that Sonic has really good ice tea! When I'm out doing errands I often drive thru and get an iced tea. The staff here is amazing! The lady that takes the orders already remembers me and my ice tea! They are fast and so courteous I have to say you would never find this in California! 
Anyway shout out to the super nice ladies that work here! Thanks for your smiling faces and awesome service! : - )"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Combos aren't really combos. Every thing is an up charge. No toys in my kids meal bags. The only thing good from this place are the slushies."}
{"text":"It's sonic, so you know the food. Somehow this location manages to consistently have god awful service.

update - service still as bad as ever. They will put mayo on everything no matter how many times you tell them not to. I can't recall a fast food restaurant besides this one ever messing up an order, but this place gets it wrong at least half the time."}
{"text":"Terrible! The food tasted so awful, I think their fryer oil must be old or something? I didn't think you could mess up tater tots. Who knew?!"}
{"text":"Took too long for someone to take my order at the drive through station after someone inside said \"just a minute.\"  Took too long for someone to take my payment at the window.  I considered driving away and to Culver's because I could not see any activity inside.  No \"thank you\" after payment.  My
Chicago and Chile Cheese dogs were just okay.  Kind of light in the chile."}
{"text":"Discontinued chicago style hot dogs & food is just okay NOT good , service is average ( took away roller skates years ago & NOT worth going their anymore.  The thrill is GONE! Bye sonic"}
{"text":"Edited: I went back yesterday to get a refund on my drink and the manager explained that they had new staff and the drink was not to the standard he wanted. I got my refund and promised that the drinks will be better. I am happily with the understand of the manager and his explanation. I do hope it goes up because I love the splash drinks"}
{"text":"Awful food. Only thing I liked was the slushy. The burger was not good , fries were cold and the cheese sauce for fries was also given completely cold. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Was there for happy hour, they took 2 things of my order brought it to me without reading my order back to me or my final price. Not only I  didnt get to finish my order. I asked to speak to the manager and he blew me off for 30 minutes before I decided to leave.  1 star. I'd give 0 if I could."}
{"text":"So, I ordered one drink in early June. The lady comes out while I'm in the drive thru and charged  my card for one drink and then swipes it again for the next drive thru order. I'm in an on going dispute for products that I didn't order or receive. I'm never going to any Sonic due to their incompetence. They're good for nothing! Thanks for nothing brainiacs. I don't know who's less competent the workers or the managers that I've tried dealing with numerous times over this issue."}

yuck - uck - gag!"}

{"text":"I paid for two tater tots and only got one. I didn't notice until I got home so it was too late. Apparently it's too difficult to count to two at this location. Now I remember why I hate and avoid fast food."}
{"text":"Stooped during a business trip, while in sun prairie area.
Wouldn't say it was a good experience. Ordered 2-hot dogs and both were dried up and crispy. There was a lot of relish and ketchup in an attempt to hide the crapy dogs.
Also tried the fried pickles, another let down. The good was the drink was up to my expectations. 
This Sonic was a let down."}
{"text":"Got my order wrong. Guy on speaker didn't even listen to what I was ordering just assumed. Not ever going again"}
{"text":"The service was terrible.  After placing order it was 20 min before we were brought our meal.   2 coney dogs and a side of tots a cherry slushy and a cherry limeade.  20 minutes!   When they delivered to the window the staff had no idea if it was our food.   They apologized for the long wait and gave us expired coupons. They left us without straws or napkins and the food was cold. After pressing the service button to ask for napkins and straws we were asked to hold  another 15 minutes.    We pulled around and I asked the staff for straws and napkins and I asked them if it was a common thing to offer expired coupons to their patrons and the kid laughed.  We were very disappointed an don't think we will ever go back.  They are receiving one star because i have to rate them something for this to post"}
{"text":"This Sonic is awful. I just sat at the drive thru window for 20 minutes waiting on food while the three employees ran around pumping out drink orders for the cars that came in behind me. I finally get my order and the burgers look like they were thrown against a wall, the bun tops were stale, and the tots were smashed into their containers. If you're going to take TWENTY minutes to make two burgers and two tots, the least you can do is make sure they're fresh and properly made."}
{"text":"Usually go drive thru and they can't ever get my order correct. But what really threw it off is when I went last night, I told her I had a coupon for a 6 inch premium hot dog and she kept insisting I had the wrong coupon, I told her that what I was saying was what the coupon said, she came out with an attitude and saw that my coupon was valid she walked away. Didn't even bother to apologize or anything. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Their opening was a success. The employees all do a great job in orders and are very kind!"}
{"text":"We stopped here to pick up gift cards for teacher thank you gifts. After 20 minutes (and us calling back) they came out to tell us they were out of gift cards. I'm not sure why it took them 20 minutes to figure that out.
I've also had experiances of broken stalls, and messed up orders at this location.
We are HUGE Sonic fans, especially to head up for happy hour right after I pick my girls up from school, but we now go out of our way to skip this location."}
{"text":"The drinks and shakes are good when they can actually get my order right, besides that all the food sucks. Get their act together and they could get another star."}
{"text":"Here before 8 am.. No eggs and no delivery for their breakfast menu until 9am. Buy at least a positive you can order off their regular menu #poorplanning #lunchtime?"}
{"text":"First time at this location. I placed my order in the drive thru, and when I pulled up to pay I realized I forgot to order something, so I waited about 5 minutes for her to open the window. There is a machine outside of the window to pay with card, maybe she was waiting for me to pay but 5 minutes ? When she opened the window I asked if I could ask something to my order, she could have easily answered \"sure no problem\" or \"no it's too late sorry\".... she just ignored me and kind of sighed. She clicked some thing on the register and said \"go ahead\"... I come home to find my drink isn't even mixed. Attitude and my order wasn't made correctly. Get it together sonic. I believe the girls name was Chrysta per receipt."}
{"text":"Love the food but the service is lacking. 
I pull up and there is only 1 other vehicle in the place and it takes them a couple mins to answer... but I can look past that as I am starving..
But there where a couple of shady looking people so we just got our food and left"}
{"text":"I hold this Sonic scared, because it is here that I saw the light.

An east coast native living in NorCal, I had never been to Sonic before. So when my boyfriend and I drove in one afternoon after a spring training game we had no idea we were about to have a life changing experience.

Say what you will about Sonic-- it's fast food, it promotes car culture, it's bad for you-- I don't care. Sonic's the only place in the world where you and your bestest friend can pull up on a warm, sunny afternoon, listen to tunes on your car stereo, talk in to a box and a few minutes later have someone-- on rollerskates!-- present to you the BEST diet cherry coke you've ever had in your life (with a side of tater tots!).

Oh, Sonic. I love you. I visit Phoenix every year, and as much as I enjoy the baseball the first thing I do upon rolling in to town is drive in to your welcoming parking. The light shines down through the sunroof, and I know I've found Nirvana."}
{"text":"FREAKIN AWESOME DRUNK FOOD!!!! They have things that you usually might get at a diner, but it's more convenient because you don't have to get out of the car! Yay to corn dogs, mozzerella cheese sticks!!!!!, chili cheese dogs with fritos, shakes, and desert and blah blah mmMM.. dRoOoL.... 

like everyone else said... i want one by my house.... =("}
{"text":"stopped by on my bike yesterday for a chili cheese dog...
service was great, but the chili on the dog was tepid in temperature 
i thought about not eating it, but finished it anyway....when i
got home about 1 hr later, i felt sick and spent the rest of the
night in the bathroom....after reviewing what i had eaten the day before
and that day, i am convinced that it was the chili...i ruled out
flu since i had no other symptoms and feel much better today...


1/5/2018... update....i stand by the temp of the chili being cool, 
but i now
feel that a just got a stomach flu bug that lasted 24 hrs and nothing
to do with Sonic's food..."}
{"text":"I love Sonic, was really happy to see there was one not to far from my home, and eventually had the chance to come check it out. Went with my mom and my daughter, and attempted to order from the car, what a fiasco. The girl who was taking the order was totally uninvolved, you could hear the, \"I don't give a s#*t\" attitude in her voice. I had to repeat everything thing I said like 3 to 4 times. I have honestly never experienced anything like it. After 7 minutes of giving just the first part of my order I finally said \"Nevermind, forget it, you obviously don't want to do your job.\" And left. 
Decided, (stupidly enough) to go back a week later, this time going inside. Now not 100%, but I'm pretty sure it was the same girl. She literally did not even look at me while I was ordering, just stared at her coworkers on the floor, then proceeds to say.. Huh? Cause big surprise she didn't hear me. Ok Sonic please, if your the owner and are reading this, hire some older staff, these kids can care less, and it shows. I'm seeing the awful reviews, and I can't help but agree with them. Get a new crew, get your customers back. I'd hate to see ya close, but I sure wouldn't be surprised."}
{"text":"the drinks here are soooo good. as for the food.....eh"}
{"text":"This location is the absolute worst ever! I thought maybe it could change if I went at different times of the day and different days of the week. Wrong! My first problem I encountered was their drive thru not working. That wasn't a big issue as I pulled into a stall. 

Second time I've encountered an issue, it took 15 minutes for the person to take my order in the drive thru. I ordered a family size jumbo popcorn chicken and she stated they didn't sell that. It is clearly advertised on the menu. (I'm assuming it took her 10 minutes to find the button.) 

Today, I've encountered my third issue. Kaitlyn who took my order was not so pleasant! She carried no enthusiasm and was not interested in revenue for the business. I ordered 2 hot dogs and a coney dog meal with tots and a slushee. As I got to the window, I've realized I didn't order myself a drink and wanted to add a duplicate slushee. Kaitlyn then stated, \"We can not add to an order at the window because of how busy we are. You're order has already been popped off.\" Understandable, however I have not been charged yet, so how is it \"popped off\" and it's JUST A DRINK! So she then made another order for the drink and I received two different transactions, which is ok, however, why did it take 2 seconds to make my drink but 10 minutes to make 3 hotdogs and a small tots? Unbelievable! I will drive the extra 10 minutes to go to another location, IF I ever decide to eat here again! I'm disgusted and appalled at the customer service! This place needs a renovation on employment!"}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely horrible. Don't ever expect this to be a quick stop. Expect to literally sit there for minutes before they answer your call button and then on average 20 min + for your food.... But wait there is more... They do not get orders correct so you have to wait even longer for your order to come out again correctly."}
{"text":"The cheese on my sonic burger was not melted and the bacon was cold and hard!
Jordayn was working the drive thru and was professional.
I visited this sonic 1/5/17 at about 7:30pm"}
{"text":"Super slow service-waited 7 minutes for a drink on a Friday night at 7:30pm. The girl must have been a newbie with no training she struggled with everything. If I could give zero stars I would. Sonic step up your training and don't leave a newbie by herself on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Love Coming Here For The Midnight Milkshake...Clearly It's No 5-Star Restaurant But It's A Great Place To Reminisce About The Good Old Days!"}
{"text":"They are always happy and friendly.   I have never had any food from sonic, I only go for their slushy drinks and ice cream.   The Reese's sundae cone was surprisingly good.  There could be more slushy ice to the drinks, they are a little more runny than I would like them."}
{"text":"Well, parked to get some food and the lady put in our order wrong in screen and then when we tried to tell her and order more she just put up the pay screen? So we pressed the button and nobody got back to us for awhile and then it was a man .. we told him what happened and he was like \"speak up please?\" And we did and then it went completely silent and we waited about 10 minutes until we decided to just pull into the drive through.. this is kind of ridiculous don't you think? Probably won't come here again.. very rude."}
{"text":"Sonic is always an easy choice for after work since its on my way home. I love the burgers and tots and even the occasional Carmel sundae. I only wish it didn't make my stomach hurt every time I ate it, although I would eat it more often if that were the case."}
{"text":"I know I know its a chain but I have to give yelp love to sonics for the best
drinks! I had the Lemon - berry real fruit slush for the past 2 days. I ended up taking a Large drink back with me to CA. And yes, it didn't melt!! Their food is not the best but come on .. Sonic is known for their drinks not the food. 

Plus, you can't beat 24 hour drive thru!"}
{"text":"I went to drive through window; two lanes...there were 3 cars ahead of me. I noticed it took about 5 minutes for each car to go through. Their food was NOT ready when they pulled up to window. By the time I realized this was a disaster I couldn't get out as there were cars behind me and ahead of me. I waited 16 minutes to just order. When I pulled up I could hear people talking to each other and not about the food. I started saying hello hello and they were still talking. I then beeped horn a few times abd finally someone said please hold we'll be with you in a minte. Two more mintes.  It had been almost 20 minutes with three cars ahead of me and I hadnt even ordered. I ordered two grilled cheese. It probably took another 10 minutes to get to window. When I saw when I turned corner I saw people just standing there talking, not doing anything but yapping. I figure because it took so long my food would be ready. I was wrong.now it wasn't overstaffed because I saw tons of people working but nothing was coming out. The girl asked me what my order was...ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I said 2 grilled cheese. She takes my debit card and closes the window. I see her go in back and come back holding my card and says they only have 1 grilled cheese. She says will be right up. By now I have waited the most ridiculous amount of time ever in drive through. I will never ever ever ever ever go back there and I just hope this review willvhelp someone to waste a half hour of their life."}
{"text":"just took SO to airport - gone for 3 weeks before i join her for the last 8 days of her trip back to china...driving home kinda hungry, kinda down so i decided to hit sonic  - i've been there once in the past with my daughter but only had a  slush ( i did not really consider ithe drink to be a slush but hey...what do i know ! ) anyways, ordered a burger ( they are 1/2 price ) some onion rings...cost ...gee...$3....
the burger....ehhhhh ...nothing special ...the onion rings...interesting...i liked them...they have a sweet flavor with what i believe is ...hmmm...is it vanilla ?!?!  and the kicker...in my sack was ...cheesecake...nibbles/squares...somethin' like that ...thanks guys !!!   sonic is not your run of the mill drive-thru ...yes...i will try again"}
{"text":"Came to sonic here on 40th and Greenway sat outside and it was hot out ordered my meal and drink had a med drink that came with the meal guess what asked for a refill and manager said no Wow Manager sucks here so don't come expecting you'll get a refill. They told me it depended on manager so I guess manager sucks here. FYI"}
{"text":"This is the greatest Sonic ever!! The carhop that makes it so wonderful is Nathan! He serves you with a smile, very enthusiastic and great at making strawberry cheesecake shakes.. He made sure we had enough napkins..fry sauce and those awesome Sonic mints.. Nathan because of you.. we will be back to Sonic.. keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Living in Las Vegas ... 24/7 town .. when I get off work at 2 am I sometimes craze sonic .. 80% of the time they claim to be updating the system.. so 99% of the time I don't wait.. if ur gonna be 24 hour place it shouldn't take an hour to get ur food..."}
{"text":"Again horrible service. Greeted at the drive-thru speaker with \"Go ahead with your order.\" I placed my order and the only response was \"$6.37.\" Then they messed up the order. No \"sorry\" was to be heard. When she handed me my order finally, she said no words. No \"thank you\" or anything. Once again, the management of this place is awful. How do they let these employees be so rude in a service industry??"}
{"text":"Always excellent friendly service, it might take a little at times, but that's probably because I'm always rushing to work ;). If you have a drinks order they will expedite it while your in line and it made the difference tonight. Keep up the good job!"}
{"text":"Love sonic. Although this particular location is always ghetto. Either their short staffed all the time. Or they are just not all working... There is always a long line. The person in the window is always rude and snippy. Its like they take so long with the food you would think its all made from scratch but it sure doesn't taste fresh half the time... Although I still go here. I'm just saying, new management or something cause everyone is so rude."}
{"text":"Ohhhh man I am not loving Sonic anymore..  the newness has worn way off... 

 Although the drinks are the Shit... U can't argue about that!"}
{"text":"We went down for the Sonic half price shakes (after 8).  The place was pretty busy for 9, but i guess it's not that far to the strip.  I don't know how many people there would have been from out of town.  Anyway, even though I had to drive from Summerlin, is was worth the outing.  Shakes were great and they have almost 2 dozen to pick from .  good for a family of 4 all to get something for under $10 total.  Not a place I'd hang out at though.  Shakes were great and the price was right.  Banana Cream pie, that's the one."}
{"text":"Simple easy all american food. drive thru service was quick. and their slushies are amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because I feel like it was written while I was hangry, so I'm giving them a neutral  3 stars. However,  I still have never returned to this location, and won't.  They're just too slow. Maybe they should put them on skates and see if that speeds them up....."}
{"text":"In the past 6 months or so the service has improved dramatically. yay!"}
{"text":"Visited around 10pm. Had to go through the drive thru (apparently car stations were closed). The wait was appalling - 30 mins (and this is no exaggeration, 10:15 - 10:45) in a drive thru line is ridiculous, and shameful for a supposed fast food restaurant. I would've been better off hitting up Chick-fil-A or Panera Bread but pitful me craved a corn dog."}
{"text":"We waited almost 35 mintues for two milkshakes. In the mean time, they rushed out food to cars behind us in the drive through - with orders that included ice cream.
I have never seen a place more disorganized. The employees seemed to have no problem solving skills whatsoever. What a disappontment- they used to be so good!
In the end, they handed us a $2 off your next visit coupon (we don't live in Las Vegas, so we'll never be able to use it) as an apology for the poor service."}
{"text":"First time at a Sonic.   Tried the m&m cement mixer.   Or concrete mixer not sure the actual name but the texture was like frozen cake batter.   YUCK!   very pasty and weird.   Service was terrific though."}
{"text":"The girl serving me didn't know the difference between a shake and a malt. When I ordered a malt and got a shake, I let her know and then got an attitude from her. I just got a refund at that point and went to Culver's."}
{"text":"Food isn't great except for the tots... the tots are delicious. I also really like the $1 mini candy deserts. It's just the right size and so yummy! But ultimately, the 4 stars are for the drinks. Cherry and strawberry limeades, watermelon slushy.. the possibilities are endless. This place is a nice treat when the weather gets warm!"}
{"text":"The mouthfeel of this locations ice cream was weird .... Grainy as if cornmeal was in it. Reported to manager and he was very considerate offering to make it again for me. I declined but do hope their ice cream texture improves! 

The food however was perfect in a dozen different ways!!! It's funny cause I was a sonic car hop in my teens and I swear the burgers still taste exactly like they did nearly 39 years ago! YES I'm that old and no I didn't roller skate !  Excellent burger and then a side dish of perfectly fried Tots!  Hubby's chicken club was ok.... But his onion rings were just as they should be. The secret to their deliciousness I am still vowed to an oath never to divulge!  Tee hee!"}
{"text":"This location used to be really good but has gone down hill the past few months. We're always treated nicely but the actually food service is getting really lazy. Overfilling drinks to the point where they spill and it's an inconvenience to get napkins, not getting things we've asked for etc. For example just last night I wanted to treat my sister since she just got back from being out of town so I took her and also got food for my daughter and husband. Our food came back cold and my daughters hot dog meal was packaged poorly, her hot dog bun was in tatters, no toy with her meal. Our food was cold and we didn't get any condiments that we had asked for. Of course we realize this after we get back home and when we called it seemed an inconvenience to them to have us come back to get the order corrected. I don't think we'll be going back to this location after all the trouble we've had recently"}
{"text":"One star is being generous!  DISGUSTING is the most accurate description of our meal.  The cheeseburger was a gooey, gloppy mess -- a tasteless beef(??) patty drowning in a sickly yellow-green sauce.  The fact that it was delivered at room temperature didn't help matters any.

The Asiago Chicken Club sandwich -- also served at room temperature, yugh! -- didn't taste bad, because it had no flavor at all!  The onion rings looked appealing but had a distinct \"off\" taste, perhaps due to frying in old oil that was overdue for a change. With eyes closed, you would never guess you were eating an onion.

Chocolate milk shake was cloyingly sweet and covered with a mound of white stuff that had the taste and texture of silicon bathtub caulk.  The large size was indeed large, but after a few spoonfuls, the rest went into the garbage.  Too bad!

Carhop service was a novelty, but not very good unfortunately.  We didn't get ketchup or napkins with our food; ketchup was eventually provided but no napkins (until we were mostly done eating -- or NOT eating, actually).

We were excited to try Sonic because of its reputation for good burgers, but this will be our one and only visit to a distinctly sub-par eatery.  Any place that makes McDonalds look good by comparison is not worth returning to!"}
{"text":"I go here almost everyday for a tea. Love that i can add flavors to my drinks. Staff is always friendly and fairly quick."}
{"text":"I don't understand how you can go to a drive-through restaurant at peak time and the food is still cold. The line is always long no matter the time of day. No one is in a rush to do anything around there. On this particular day they had a new system for taking orders but was having trouble with it. I was not told this until I got to the window after waiting 15 minutes for a drink and a sandwich."}
{"text":"Old fashioned cream soda pops....yummy. Sonic did a great job with the cream soda and the sweet cream shakes!"}
{"text":"Just had the most disgusting meal in recent memory.  Ate about 1/4 and threw the rest away.  Ordered chili cheese dogs...got home to find I was given cheese, onions and bacon on shriveled up buns that were hard and chewy.  The fries taste like they were cooked yesterday and reheated today.  Do yourself a favor and drive right past this place!"}
{"text":"I know Sonic isn't a typical fast food place - you never go inside - but still, the employees need to be a little more cognizant of the fact that we can still see what you are doing.

Stopped there for lunch today and was parked in a stall right outside the door. I watched (after I had received and eaten my food) one of the guys that works there bring a bag of trash outside and set it down by the door. Then I watched as he went and got another bag and did the same thing. Not a minute later, he came out the door with a tray of food in his hands to deliver to a car. Hmmmm... enough time to wash your hands or no?

Also, why put the trash right by the door instead of taking it to the dumpster? Which was a few feet away, and he's on roller skates! It's not like he even had to walk there.

Right before I left, I watched a girl come out and walk right by the two bags of trash to go have a cigarette. Where she proceeded to stand right next to the dumpster. Hello? Take the trash with you maybe? 

The food was good - no complaints there. But still - do something about the health and safety aspect of this place."}
{"text":"IF I could give this negative 5 stars I absolutely would. It's close to my house, and the drink selection is great... until you find a FINGERNAIL in your mouth from taking a drink. Yep!"}
{"text":"So me and my family were coming back from the dells and stopped at sonics. While the food was good the service was good as well. The manager knew it was hot outside and decided to give me and my family free refills. Thank you Mike"}
{"text":"I always feel silly reviewing a huge chain, but my service here last week was so friendly and great I had to get my Yelp on!

They offer several manager's specials and of course half-priced drinks and other various specials depending on time of day.  I was picking up some grub for a buddy who had been helping me with man stuff at my house all day, and got him a humungous M&M Sonic Blast.  They also put up with my special request to add caramel sauce to said Blast.  ('Cause it wasn't unhealthy enough yet...?).  They also gave me ample ketchup for the two orders of tots I got.  There's nothing worse than getting home to realize there's just not enough.

There was a small young-ish family sitting outside and the awesome carhop, Elizabeth, brought out a handful of balloons for the kiddos.  Who can resist a balloon?!?

Warning: you cannot leave a tip on a credit card payment.  I HATE that...especially when there is no warning. I'm left feeling like a d-bag cheapskate, but luckily Elizabeth took it in stride as she didn't have enough change to break the only paper money I had on me."}
{"text":"Went to the greenway pkwy location got home my order was wrong the Manager Sarah Conley more than satisfied me with delivery to my home to feed my girls. I love sonic the customer service is awesome thanks Sarah 

SATISFIED AND GREAT FOOD!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars because of the service ....kris was awesome.....he went over and beyond to make our experience a pleasant one. We had a group of 12 and the service was prompt."}
{"text":"First off, I'm pregnant and have major cravings. I had been craving a blueberry slush with nerds for a week and a half. I finally go there and use the menu stall on my lunch break. I got tots, popcorn chicken, moz sticks, and my slush. I waited quite a long time to get my order. I get back to work and start to eat. My food is already pretty cold and I'm only 2 minutes away. I start drinking my slush and NO NERDS. The one thing I craved was ruined AND I paid for it. I was so unhappy with it I wanted to just cry. I could've just went to the gas station and got a slush there."}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich was supposed to have no lettuce extra mayo. Had to pick the brown lettuce off of the dry nuggets. Disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium cherry slushe....all i got was ice and some juice on the bottom. $2.39 for a cup of ice...thanks. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I just left and it took over 15 minutes to get to number two's through the system.
You're in a car sitting outside in 105° and it takes over 15 minutes to get to hamburgers this is absolutely out rages"}
{"text":"Got to this location on 2/5/2017 at 1:45 pm. Placed our order which consisted of 2 burger meals,  and 2 hot dog meals . 30 minutes later our food came out, ice cold and the hot dogs were missing!! Gave the food back to the girl and told her that I wasn't paying for cold and missing food. Asked her to send the manager out and she said he would be out in just a minute...well....10 minutes passed and no manager so I buzzed the buzzer and got a gentleman who said he was the manager, so I told him the issue and he never once offered to fix anything or rectify the problem. Told him the we wouldn't be back and his reply was ok, amd clicked off the speaker! This manager definately needs to some training on how to run his crew and how to deal with the public!"}
{"text":"I went around 11:00am and ordered a large Cherry Nerd slushy, a large Mango Iced Tea and three chicken strips sandwiches. There was only one other car and they sort of took a long time. 

The chicken strip sandwiches where made perfectly not sloppy and they came with like 3-4 stripes of chicken which is pretty good for $1.49. The slushy was sort of melted but it was delicious and the Mango tea I took a sip of it (not for me) and it tasted sweet and good. 

The service was good but not fast just normal I guess. The cashier was nice and not rude. The waiter in the roller skates was nice too. Everything was awesome and no complaints."}
{"text":"Good for a late night stop or a snack. Their grilled cheese is pretty good considering it's fast food. I've gotten fries and onion rings one or two times though and they tasted really weird...like an unusually strong oil flavor. I think it tasted like they maybe hadn't changed their oil out in awhile...yummy. Not. Haha. They have the little pellet style ice which is great of course. Overall, okay fast food. I don't think it's any better than getting other fast food though."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Sonic's before until I moved here to Nevada.  We don't have a Sonic's out there in Hawaii (which they should btw).  I like that they still serve on roller skates like they did in the past.  You don't have to leave your car! Even better! My fav here is the slushies.  HAPPY HOUR slushies are the best! Super cheap! Love their tater tots! So good!! Unfortunately I don't get to go here very often so i'm not that familiar w/ their menu.  Tried some of their burgers & wasn't disappointed.  Their shakes are good as well."}
{"text":"We visited this damn Sonic location after seeing the commercial for the Lil' Doggies. Our hearts were set on those delicious little chili cheese covered puppies. After waiting what seemed like forever in the drive thru, we were informed their warmer was broken and no doggies were to be eaten. Disgusted, we canceled the rest of our order and drove off into the sunset. Hungry, outraged, and disturbed, we went across the street to Checkers. Sonic, get your sh*t together."}
{"text":"Ugh!  I got swayed by the Facebook newsfeed promise of a $0.79 pineapple ice cream slushy, and it was a disaster.  The universe was totally punishing me this morning for not being able to resist the temptation of a frozen, fruity breakfast.

I felt rushed to place my order even though I never pressed the call button and there was no one else there waiting for my spot. Then I was informed that there was to be no ice cream slushy.  I am a bit annoyed that they planned this promotion for today and didn't have the necessary equipment ready to go in the morning, but at the same time, I am probably the only one who tried to order ice cream at 7am, so it's not like they're risking a whole lot.

Surprise extra eggs got added to my order, which I would have declined if they had asked first.  This was definitely a case of the employee trying too hard to be nice and just completely missing the mark (same goes for him rushing me to place my order). 

Am I the only one who assumes all coffee, iced or hot, will be served black unless otherwise described or requested?  This is not the first place I have ordered an iced coffee and gotten some muddy, syrupy garbage.  But there are also plenty of places where it's understood that \"iced coffee\" = ice + coffee.  So the coffee may not have been the employee's screw up, it may have been Sonic's.

Then he overcharged me, and got frustrated when I pointed it out."}

I urge those reading to know in advance that this review is being composed while we wait within gridlock, stemmed nonetheless, by a convoluted drive thru line consisting of no less than 20 cars - total.

Did I miss a memo?

What the heck is going on? This is the equivalent of dozing off and awakening to see an ICE raid with no type of advanced warning!

Thinking we'd somehow stumbled upon a method towards escaping Alcatraz, we pulled up to an order box and were promptly informed per our pressing the call button that:

\"THE DRIVE UP BOX WAS CLOSED DUE TO A LACK OF EMPLOYEES\".

The result of this obvious deficiency was our being forced to circle around and join in on the paddy-wagon by adding to the drive thru line. Half an hour later, we're still here and while I've phoned 911..... THE ONE PHONE CALL I'M PERMITTED, I'm driven to think they've prioritized some other emergency. 

Perhaps it was that Amber Alert that I received a cell phone alert for a bit earlier.

Whatever the case. Help me somebody! 

Help me please!

This is absolute entrapment and I will gladly perform a lap dance and a foot massage to the first person enabled to air lift us from this horse-shoed traffic jam that is this Sonic's drive thru!

Y'all hear that? Kenny Ken will balance your bunyans for some much overdue assistance!!!

Had I been better prepared, I'd have requested someone put money on my books.

SERIOUSLY - if you don't have enough manpower to perform your duties effectively, WHYYYYY THE HECK EVEN OPEN UP SHOP???!

(sighs....)

Geeyodd DAYUM. All a brutha wanted was a Cherry Limeade slurpie, but I'm so darned dehydrated at this point, I'll gladly settle for a cup of ice cubes, some tator tots and a prison tat.

Yours In Prayer (....or until we make parole, whichever comes first).

{"text":"Sonic should be ashamed of themselves. They really know how lower standards. I came in for lunch around 1pm, my order came around $9. I was pretty hungry. Well 45 minutes later I still have no food. I would of left but I already paid for my food. When it finally came they gave me no reason why it took so long. No reason??? What a joke. When I finally tried the food, it was just warm, or almost warm. I regretted this trip... Which doesn't happen often."}
{"text":"I'm feeling like a DIET CHEERY LIMEADE! Where is the ONLY place I can go?! Sonic! The personnel there are always friendly and even remember my name. It's a 50's atmosphere with roller skate deliveries and CHICAGO STYLE HOTDOGS! This stop is a MUST as you say hello to Jonathon and receive the best food in Chandler!"}
{"text":"OMG I LOVE the lemon berry slushi!! AHHH This drink is my favorite from sonic! Its seriously SO good."}
{"text":"I just go to Sonic for their AMAZING Lemon berry slush.... ooo so good. The best combination ever. Real lemons and strawberries.

this thing is the best to cool you down. AHHHHHH I want another one just thinking about it. Happy hour starts at 3pm!"}
{"text":"I stopped here on my way home from my night shift. I usually don't eat fast food but I was hungry and thought I would try it. I ordered the breakfast burrito without meat and small tots. The burrito was tasteless. The eggs tasted old and maybe like they had been setting around for a while and the tortilla tasted like I imagine chewy paper to taste. I was even dissatisfied with the tots. Bland. I took a few bites and had to throw the remainder away. It was inedible as far as I am concerned. Very disappointed in Sonic as I enjoy their Blasts. I definitely do not recommend Sonic breakfast burrito or tots. The car hop was very polite and pleasant though and the service was quick."}
{"text":"Second Sonic visit in my lifetime, first at this location. We waited about ten minutes in the drive-thru, but were craving cherry limeades like nobody's business! Found out that we can get the slushie version of the cherry limeade. What?! We ordered two mediums and the TOTAL was $1.98. They apparently have a \"happy hour\" every day from 2-4 with half off all drinks. Well worth the trip over there."}
{"text":"Came here on a trip from Oregon. Ordered two separate orders, they charged both of them to one card. The manger came out and refunded them(which was nice), went around to one of the spots where You order from your car, got 8 corn dogs and a couple jalapeño poppers. 15 minutes later they came out and brought one corn dog and the jalapeño poppers, so we told them we had ordered 8 not 1 so they said they'd make fresh ones and we ended up waiting 35 minutes for 7 corn dogs. Not happy"}
{"text":"Stopped for 2 ice cream cones. The amount of soft serve ice cream didn't equal one on a McDonald's cone and we all know how small they are. Not sure, but got the impression this was done on purpose since the window attendant ignored any size comments from us. We used to go there for cones because it was a good value (amount for the cost), but no more."}
{"text":"I don't think I can give Sonic five stars anyway, but this one needs to get its sea legs a bit before I return. Waited an extra long time in the drive-thru, both before and after ordering (despite there being two ordering \"portals'). I could see that the work area near the cashier was a hot mess. I could overhear the employees shouting to each other through the drive-thru speaker (not in an argumentative way, but rather, in a frantic, \"Oh shit, we just opened yesterday and we don't know what the eff we're doing yet\" kind of way).

Nevertheless, the tots were hot and the frozen cherry limeade made my teeth hurt, so everything was as it should be in that regard. Plus, the guy brought the stuff to my car window when he saw that I was waiting a long time behind somebody.

I am glad this Sonic opened on Mayfield, and maybe in a couple of weeks it'll become the well-oiled machine I've come to expect."}
{"text":"The food never looks like what you see in the pictures of their menu's.  But I have to say the food isn't that bad and their drinks are off the chart.  I love the root beer floats and the tater tot's with chili and cheese are off the chart.  My kids love the boneless wings too.

Food is always hot when we order."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time, order two waffle cones for the girls, 2.89 then for the boys two blasts  for the equivalent fee of 2.89 and was given a minuscule cup of ice cream with crushed cookies on it. 
For my self I thought ohhh a vanilla cream soda would be wonderful, the girl asked if i would like the ice crushed, I mistakenly said ,\"Yes\" and end up with a vanilla shake with vanilla flavoring that tasted sour, even the kids wouldn't drink it. 
SO 14.00 dollars later, the only two out of five that were happy were the girls. The waffle cones were a hit.
I didn't send it back, because I was heading to Chandler blvd and Country club to pick boys up from baseball and didn't realize the gross ickiness till after we had left."}
{"text":"The slowest sonic of my life. Friendly staff, but I was in the drive-through with only two cars in front of me and I was in line for at least 20 minutes. Super frown."}
{"text":"This is the worst sonic location I have been to. Every time my husband and I attempt to eat at this establishment they cannot seem to grasp the concept of a combo.

We typically usually order the number 1 & 5 combo and will even state we are wanting a combo. 

Yet, when they repeat the order back to us they never ask if we want fries or tots or what drink we want. When we try and point out that we were never asked these questions, they get confused right away and say \"oh you wanted the combo?\" 
And then somehow get even more confused and mess up the order to where it's not even close to being correct.

We have had to leave more than 3 times without ordering anything because they simply don't understand what it means to order a combo.

Never have I experienced going to a fast food restaurant ordering a number (1, 2, 3 etc.) and having that fast food place not ask me what size side or drink I want.


I don't understand what it is about this particular Sonic but, they really need to get more organized. Because this is a reoccurring issue and it's really frustrating because I genuinely like to eat at Sonic and get so annoyed at how much they screw up."}
{"text":"I don't know why I continue to punish myself by coming here.  They have been consistently slow here for at least 8 months.  Save yourself time and head to the grocery store and buy the ingredients for whatever you planned on ordering and go home and cook it.  It will be faster and probably not be incorrect."}
{"text":"Been in the drive through for 20 minutes now.. This sonic sucks! People use the drive through for convenience and efficiency. Really annoying I only get an hour for lunch and I spend most of it in this drive through lane which I can't even get out of. They should add a bail lane if they are going to be this slow!!!"}
{"text":"I  really love sonic. Yet this location is the only location in the area. Their service is always sub par, and you usually have to wait longer than you should... Even if you're just buying a few drinks. I would say avoid this location if you can, but if you live in the area and love Sonic, it's pretty much you're only option. Food is hit-or-miss, sometime you can get a very fresh sandwich or tots, and others you will receive food that you know has been sitting longer than it should have been. I think they need to take a look at what is hurting this location."}
{"text":"Always great service. I like this location easy to get in and out plus it's always clean. 
I love the little ice cubes and they do cater to my husband cooking everything \"Well Done\". Kiddos to Sonic Burger c"}
{"text":"Apple pack was expired. I asked Megan our car server if she could get me another and she offered for me to choose anything else. 
Very nice customer service and top of the line hot dogs."}
{"text":"This Sonic is the worst.  Boneless wings were cold, rubbery, and floating in a pool of sauce.   I had to go back and wait another 10 minutes in line. (One car ahead of me- they are also super slow) they did refund my money, but then I was without lunch."}
{"text":"Currently have been waiting 30 minutes for two shakes. We've asked twice where they are. Will NEVER be back, this is insane! Then they finally gave them to us completely melted. Then they remade them...incorrectly. We were offered nothing for our time, barely an apology. Total time was 50 mins for 2 shakes."}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience at Sonic I've ever had. We went to go buy a couple Burgers because they were half off after 5 on Tuesdays.  They ended up getting our Burgers wrong and only took $2 off instead  of given Burgers half off.  Their drive-thru intercom sucks so bad we could hardly even understand each other.  
Don't waste your time with these clowns they don't have their s*** together!"}
{"text":"Worst Sonic location I've ever experienced! This sonic is the closest place to my office to grab a quick burger. Every time I visit here I do it reluctantly and regrettably as I have yet to have a positive experience. In the past it has been anything from burgers that were rock hard or soggy, missing items, or not following through with specific request. Today, I was once again lured back as I was in need of a quick lunch and saw that they had a special for half priced cheeseburgers for tax day. I ordered a cheeseburger with no mayo and the cashier then asked if I wanted ketchup and mustard and I said yes. When I got back to the office and opened the foil wrapper, the burger was cold, disgustingly soggy and of course included the mayo that I specifically requested not to. I could not even fathom someone wanting to eat this pile of slop. I am beyond frustrated as I used to really enjoy Sonic, but this location is just horrible. They need to fire everyone and start from scratch. Regardless, I will not be coming back here anymore."}
{"text":"My husband and I visit on a fairly regular basis, especially during happy hour for half price drinks. They're usually pretty fast with drinks and reasonable with food. The breakfast is delicious, sandwiches are above average for fast food, and burgers are middle tier. The crispy tots are fantastic! If you order specials, you can eat and drink inexpensively.

The microphones at the drive in stalls are apparently very poor because they always have trouble understanding us even when speaking loudly, slowly, and clearly. However, it's very nice to be able to pull in, look over the menu, and order/eat at our own leisure and pace."}
{"text":"Just went there for first time with work colleague and it was not anything to write home about! The line was slow at 11:35 a.m.? Seemed like the kitchen took some time to wake up. They gave someone elses milkshake to my colleague while that guy stood there fuming as he was first?! I had an all American dog & double bacon cheeseburger; and neither of them were all that good! The hotdog tasted like the cheapest you could ever buy; and the burger was totally lacking in any kind of flavor...bland! I agree with many fellow reviewers in here, stay away and go some where you know will be at least \"OK\" in the fast food arena!"}
{"text":"Went to get the half price shake.  Drive in at 7:56 and was told by some smart mouth kid thay I would have until 8 pm to get the special.  So I parked and waited until 8:01 and ordered.  Was told over the intercom that the total was $3:01.  The shakes were eventually brought to the car and I was then told that the total was $6.89.  When I ask why, I was told it was because the shakes were ordered before the special started.  My question is....how did the amount change from what I was quoted when they were ordered.  We eventually just left and went somewhere that has decent customer service.   I'm sure the smart  a$$  kid thinks she won the war."}
{"text":"Ordered two kids meals and three drinks...was given each item one at a time and then told \"goodbye!\"  
Had to knock on the service window of the drive-thru to get my remaining items."}
{"text":"This is another restaurant that is on my way to work. The staff has always been friendly and the service is decently quick. Morning staff is small so if it's busy, the service does become slower. 

They offer all their menu items all day long so you can get lunch for breakfast or breakfast for dinner it doesn't matter! It's one of the reasons I continue to come. I never liked breakfast items and much prefer lunch time options.

If all you need is a cup of ice or ice water that it free. If you add lemon it'll cost maybe $0.30? The have the small chip ice and you can buy it by the bag too! They have a ton of other drink options like slushies, soda, limeaids, milkshakes, coffee, iced coffee, and juices. Don't forget their 1/2 price happy hours between 2 and 4 if I remember correctly.

They have kids meals which is nice also and a value menu if you don't want to splurge. If you want to splurge some more, when getting the value items and you want extra like lettuce, pickles, onions, etc. asked them for everything on it, or whatever you prefer to have. It doesn't cost extra like at McDonald's or other places.

Most times when I want a cheeseburger I'll get the value burger and have them add everything like if I were getting their regular burger. They only difference in the value items and the regular menu items is that the value items don't have as much meat. But you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"Worst drive thru I've been to in a long time. They didn't even give me my receipt so I could say anything."}
{"text":"I really want to like Sonics but the food always seems to fall short of my expectations. (and I don't expect much for fast food joints) love the numerous drink options, and the parking-ordering option, but in the end it's all about the food, and the food just isnt all that."}
{"text":"So I'm here for a half price shake after 8 pm I ordered  my shake  20 minuets ago and still haven't got it. I was unaware you needed a degree in rocket science to make a damn shake. Half price shakes after 8= half ass service!!!!! I won't be coming back for a shake anytime soon!"}
{"text":"When did fast-food become such a waiting game? 15 minutes in a drive thru line is not quality service. Ended up leaving the line and won't be returning anytime soon. If you got half an hour to burn go check out the aweful service!"}
{"text":"By far the slowest service I have ever gotten. I should have gone to the grocery store and cooked something(would have been quicker) I do not understand how you can go to a fast food joint and be the only ones there and still take 30 minutes to get the food. It is sad because I always liked Sonic."}
{"text":"Me and my wife came when there was almost no one at this location. We ordered tots and medium hot fudge shakes. They brought us hot fudge sundaes. Then after we got our food they came back out and asked us to re-park our car in the empty parking lot because we pulled in backwards. We will not be returning to this poorly managed Sonic."}
{"text":"Passed thru here the other night on my way home 4 their happy hour 1/2 off drinks, dessert shakes. Got a pineapple upside down master blaster & a cheesecake shake. They don't skimp on toppings or ingredients (there's a reason why any of the remaining DQ's stopped doing their upside~down test when going 4 the occasional Blizzard or 2 sample a new flavor). 

   I don't get much in the way of food here since becoming a Veg~head so I can't vouch 4 other menu items but I do remember everything b4~hand being pretty decent 4 what it is & I really hope they keep their sweet potato tots on the menu as I like them even better than the regular tots (which is already a lot)! 

   I find myself here from time 2 time 4 their happy hour specials or on their patio area when I don't wanna drink my StarF*cks or have it spilled on me in the whirlwind constrained claustrophobia of next door.

   The hop servers here have always been friendly, johnny~on~the~spot & even when I've been in tow w/ other friends because they wanted something from here, orders have always been correct, warm & fresh so there's no bad experiences I've had or witnessed. I feel they deserve 5* = the drinks/desserts & service, just wasn't a fave of that kinda food back when I did have it, other than their tots & especially the sweet potato kind which r the Bomb!!"}
{"text":"I'd always heard tales of the fabled Sonic Drive-In, but it was like a whisper in the wind or a thief in the night...I never truly believed. Legends with tantalizing visions of juicy burgers, golden fries, creamy milk shakes, and flavored sodas came across state lines into Los Angeles, but how could such wonders be true? 

What began as an ordinary day would end in a night forever seared into the archives of my mind. As we were blindly driving through the dimly lit streets of Phoenix, an illuminated sign appeared to us, as if an answer to a prayer. Sonic came to us all at once in a haze. We ordered burgers, fries, onion rings, popcorn chicken, a corn dog, chili tots, and shakes upon shakes! Oh, the bargains! We laughed! We danced! We wept! The next morning, all I had was the echo of a stomach ache as proof of the marvels of the night before.

Maybe, just maybe, if I clap my hands enough and really believe, one will suddenly appear in the South Bay. One can only dare to dream."}
{"text":"This is the slowest sonic I have ever been too. Also, why build a drive way and a door to \"hop\" cars out and then not utilize it ? The drinks were good , bad customer service."}
{"text":"I think one star is the perfect rating for this place. It's actually the whole reason I made a yelp. I only come here because it's so close to my house, but I ONLY ever get drinks. Maybe a food item if I'm feeling desperate... It still takes the staff an abnormally long time for drinks. Five minutes doesn't sound long, but when I'm the only person in the drive thru line and I'm just getting two drinks, it's pretty ridiculous. I get it. I worked in food service. I understand some things take time, especially after rushes, but come on. This is a consistent problem with this Sonic (and upon reading other Sonic reviews, it seems to be a company wide thing). I would stop going to this location and all Sonics altogether if I didn't love their strawberry limeades so much."}
{"text":"Horrific customer service.  When you sit in a car hop space or idle in the drive thru line you can often observe 4-5-6 workers congregated near the register chit-chatting, drinking, watching, texting and hanging out... not actively engaged in food or order prep... it can be very frustrating.  This is one of the slowest drive-thrus I have ever been in (consistently) and it often prompts us to pull in to a space and order via the drive-up screen.  Tonight, we pulled into a space, facing the building and watched as the employees were hanging out, talking drinking their drinks, texting and not being the least bit productive or service oriented.  EVEN if half of them were waiting on food to be readied for delivery, not one of them could break free to deliver an order that was ONLY a drink?

THEN... to make matters worse, they delivered the wrong drink.  This is not the first time, sadly.  I had my hands full, so, until I got home and unloaded the vehicle, did I decide to take a sip.  We were given SWEEEEET TEA, when we repeatedly said... REGULAR TEA, UNSWEETENED TEA, NO SUGAR, and were then called upon to acknowledge the order on the screen.  Additionally, the order receipt specifies UNSWEETENED TEA.

I called the Manager, Robert... and don't have the least bit of confidence that he was really engaged in the call.  He even challenged me to get the receipt to verify that I had told the truth, that the order was for UNSWEETENED TEA (CHK 451).  I had already told him we were home, in our jammies and were parked in the last available space, unable to return to correct SONIC'S error and pick up another order that they will continue to go back and forth with, over and over, do I want SWEET or UNSWEETENED... regular or ICED TEA or what.  EVERY single time we come there we specify that we want it regular, unsweetened and no sugar and again get asked the same series of questions that are routinely disregarded.  Some nights the drive through wait is well over 20 minutes for only a few cars.  During this time we see 4, 5, or 6 kids in the front area, hanging out.

~HUGE FAIL~  This happens when ordering a drink or meals and drinks.  The propensity of employees to question, re-question and not listen when asking the question or prompting for the order is not OK.  If you are taking an order, pay attention.  Your employees are NOT gifted at multi-tasking on any level.  What they end up doing is piss poor on all fronts."}
{"text":"Slow service. I've come multiple times to the drive through and end up waiting more than five minutes for service."}
{"text":"Very pregnant and like you would expect I have late night cravings which is always nice to live by a 24/7 sonic's. So when I do i can go get a milk shake because jack in a box and McDonalds while 24/7 ALWAYS have there machines down at this time.. So that being said I was having one tonight and when we go there is absolutely no one there.. No closed sign or anything thing just vacant !! Idk what is going on but defiantly disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just horrible!!!!!! They served me a shake that tasted just like milk and no ice cream all fluid. I'm so disappointed! At least tell customers that your ice cream machine is down."}
{"text":"Went tonight and there was one car in front of me. I waited in line for at least 15-20 mins. Once I got to the window there was no hello or I apologize for the wait. The worst customer service ever! I don't understand how these people have customer service jobs and don't provide it smh!"}
{"text":"Customer service is always horrible. The employee Alexis is disrespectful, rude, and incompetent. Food orders were incorrect. Definitely would drive the extra few miles to avoid this location."}
{"text":"Great service, very kind & understanding employees. I came in just at the beginning of happy hour and I had the black girl. She was very sweet and didn't get upset when I dropped her money and the wind blew it away! Lol! I said God Bless you and she said you as well, have a great day! No complaints. I just got back from my second trip of the day for the shakes after 8p and the service was no less pleasing! Five stars and I most definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a long time, mainly because my orders got TOTALLY mixed up twice in a row... the first time they didn't even bother explaining what kinds of specials they had on the board... so you don't know if you're getting what's on it or what! First time. Second - got a completely different order from what I ordered. Some may argue that 'kids work there...' excuse? Nahh... the work ethic has gone down tremendously in recent years everywhere. Is it all their fault?  Not completely. The managers are also complicit in this and are probably just out of high school themselves. Again,  valid excuse? Noo, how about they confirm their orders, explain, you know do what you're supposed to do in the job of a fast food restaurant. It doesn't matter what kind of job it is.... a work ethic is a work ethic... and if 'the kids' are like this now... how are they going to be later?! They lost a customer... at least at this location.. unless I go again,  confirm my order before I leave... or if I find it IS wrong, go back around the drive thru as I heard someone did and they get a surprise! Back!! And maybe they get the order right this time... and a little humble pie... Not something *they* probably ordered. ;-/"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. I love happy-hour and the half-priced drinks that come between those heavenly hours of 2-5pm.....the problem is, their service and quality of food has gone down over the last few months. Today, I spent almost 20 minutes in the drive-through, and there were only 3 cars ahead of me. At the ordering microphone (is that what it's called?) I had to repeat myself 3 times before they got my order correct. At the window, I had to wait quite a while (around 10 minutes). I'm pretty sure the guy behind me gave me the finger (sorry buddy! not my fault). Upon coming home, I found that the onion rings I received were soggy, and the cheeseburger I ordered lacked that ever-so-wonderful cheese. I had ordered several drinks (for me, the wife, and 2 of the kids), and they had to \"remake\" the drinks because the first set was leaking all over the drink carrier. 

Look. I am not a negative person, I even feel a little bad about the 3 star rating, but this experience was just one of several bad visits over the last few months. That being said, I know that I will be back, disappointment and all. That damn half-priced happy-hour is just too addicting."}
{"text":"0 stars if I could. I asked for a gluten free hamburger. She said we don't have anything here that's gluten free. Well that's a lie because the website has a numerous list of gluten free things to eat. On top of that, she had a very rude negative attitude when I asked for a hamburger. I know it's a fast food place and you make minimum wage and you hate your job, but treat customers with respect and learn your job!"}
{"text":"My very first experience with Sonic was the Gilroy, CA location. I wasn't that much of a fan at that point. Food was salty/burned and the staff was less than desirable. 

I have to admit my Las Vegas experiences with Sonic have been way better. The staff at this location has always been super nice to me. My usual order includes a Chicken Sandwich, Fries/Onion rings, and milkshake of some kind. It's standard fast food fare, but I do enjoy the \"car-hop\" feel"}
{"text":"Well it's seem like no one do there job I stop by here for lunch cause I haven't had sonic in awhile and what do you know cold tater tot's so when the carhop came back with my extra ketchup I let them know that I had Cold tots and he goes back inside and come back out with more cold tots get it together I should call chuck"}
{"text":"As a former employee of a sonic store it angers me when I Oder the simplest of things you send out cold tots tell me your going to bring out fresh one which is fine cause I know how long they cook then come and past that time and tell that you're just now making them I won't and then send me tots the you dropped back in the grease REALLY!!!  I can tell the fucking different between fresh and reheated tots get your shit together"}
{"text":"Really good and quick at this store I like their service. They just need a carhop that speaks good English plus Spanish cues her English was hard to understand. They was happy to take my coupon I had for my hotdogs no questions asked"}
{"text":"Really slow service I order 2 hot dogs which normally take less then 5 min. I paid for my food and a like 5 min the sign told me car hop is on way then I waited another 3 min. So after total of 8 min waiting I went to door asked a car hop coming out she had no clue and went in asked about my food she came out and said it will be a while they still cooking so I explained it crazy that people had came after me and left before so I want a refund. She went and told management on duty and they gave me refund and I'm stil waiting for money to get back to my card."}
{"text":"As others mentioned, the food is nothing special; you can do better going up the road a few more miles to the South 21 in Matthews.  But the lower than average rating is because on 2 separate occasions they got our order wrong.  I don't mean forgetting no cheese or something, I mean the sandwich delivered ( chicken tenders on a roll) wasn't the one ordered ( a hamburger). The receipt showed the right things ... but someone is sloppy / lazy in assembling the orders for the girls to bring out.  That's wasteful, Mr. Manager .... get your act together!"}
{"text":"I've never seen a more melancholy looking group of young folks in my life! Good God, these kids look like and move like they sincerely hate their jobs. I stop in now and then to order breakfast or lunch, because it's right near my office, but I've avoided it lately because of how the staff just mope around like teenaged zombies. Well, that and the fact that the last time I went through they messed up my order, so I went back into the drive through to have it corrected... but it was wrong again, so I went through once more! Anyhow, I love Sonic, but man, I don't know about this location anymore. I feel like they just don't care."}
{"text":"I came here around 830pm on Halloween night . just to get a quick snack after trick or treating with the kids. We ordered a handle of items and when i got home i was shocked.  My order of Chili Cheese Fries was made with MUSTARD instead of Cheese.  Boy did we get \"tricked\" this evening.  When i returned the next day to get a refund, the manager ( JESSICA) was less than professional.  She stated there was no way i would have mustard instead of cheese on my fries. She couldnt believe that I had come in there complaining and assumed I did it to my own. I asked her to examine the item and taste/smell it and she refused to even open the bag.  I explained I didnt think this was an appropriate joke even on Halloween. What if my children had food allergies and how do i know the rest of my order was safe,. I was issued a refund and my money was brought out to me by another staff member. She couldnt even face me again. Needless to say i will never return here. I am one to drive a distance just to have great customer service. Do not go here unless u like to eat tampered food."}
{"text":"Well... second time at ate at this location. Still the same problems. The wait is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Sonic is Sonic. I grew up without one and lived my whole life until age 19 without one. I'm alive, I'm well, and I'm pretty sure I still see it as another fast food chain and nothing too entirely special. Call me crazy, I'm just not freaking out about it. 

I've only ever had food from Sonic once and that wasn't here, so I can't include that in my review. What I can say is that our service was pretty standard. Nothing horrible and nothing spectacular. Our slushies were great, too. Well, I can only speak for mine. The boyfriend was doped up from getting his wisdom teeth out, so everything was great to him. 

Overall, no complaints and while I'm not excited beyond belief for this addition to the exciting Mayfield Road, I am pretty ok with it. Maybe I'll soon be as enthusiastic as everyone else seems to be!"}
{"text":"We sat at the drive threw (only one car in front of us) for almost 20 minutes without anyone even opening the drive threw window for the car in front of us the entire time. I walked inside to ask what was going on and they said \"just wait.\" This was the second time that I drove away at this location because I was waiting WAY TOO LONG. There are at least 3 people working so I'm not sure what the deal is but they need to get their act together there because they are losing business (another truck two cars behind us drive away as well)."}
{"text":"Happy hour slushys can't beat happy hour at this place.. definitely better than 7-11.. sadly they haven't gotten the automated paid system that comes with the app but I'm sure they'll get training for it"}
{"text":"Coming from California I was spoiled with IN N Out but Sonics for the most part hits the spot. The burgers are nice and the variety in the menu should make people happy."}
{"text":"I didn't like that there were people in street clothes going in to the kitchen and walking around and getting their own drinks. There were 3 different cars during the time that we were there that had numerous people in the car with them and they would all go in and visit the workers and get their own food n drinks. Maybe they are employees.  I don't know but it seems very dirty and unsanitary to me to have them in n out. It was about 9 30 - 10 30 pm that we were there. My sisters corn dog came out and it was smashed. It had marks on it like it was stuck in a waffle iron or something. Also...the debit card reader wasn't working."}
{"text":"Went to this sonic for the first time. I pulled up and pushed the little red button to order.... No one answered. It took about 5 mins for them to take my order which is understandable because I wasn't the only one who pulled up. So I ordered a footlong Chili cheese dog with tots and a 44oz cherry coke (my favorite). 

The food came out pretty fast. 

There were two girls that brought me my food. I assume the one that actually gave me my food was the trainee. She was nice and friendly. 

So I get back to my hotel room, it's like 30 seconds away from sonic. And I took a bite of the hot dog. It seemed like it was not fresh. But the cherry coke made up for it. So I gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"One of my favorite fast food places. Too bad the closest one to me is 40 miles away!

You get the total drive-in experience here. You park your car in front of a menu board where you place your order through the intercom and swipe your card. How convenient! Their servers bring your food to your car on roller skates, and it tastes just how you would expect fast food to be.

I'd definitely recommend Sonic if you want a different, fast food experience."}
{"text":"Love the SLUSH. Great flavors and I'm addicted to them. Going to make a list and get one each day. Half price happy hour on them from 2 - 5 daily."}
{"text":"Sonic, like most fast food \"chains\", does a good job of providing consistency in the delivery of their food and drink items.  This particular Sonic offers very large parking and \"drive through\" accommodations and its doubtful if it could ever become overcrowded.  I have eaten here twice in the last two days and I've found the quality and the service to be good.

This brings me to the question of what to order.  I personally find Sonic's drive-up menu board arrangement to be daunting.  Sonic has an extremely extensive menu; particularly their drinks menu.  They offer just about every configuration of a cold drink that is possibly imaginable both with ice cream and without ice cream as its base ingredient.  Given this, not all food and drink items can possibly be displayed on the drive up menu.  Unless you are one of those folks who doesn't mind making everyone else behind you wait as long as it takes to consider every possible option, I suggest spending a few minutes on-line exploring their menu before pulling up to the drive through.  For those who are interested in the nutritional aspects of what they are about to consume, Sonic has listed every quantifiable component known to mankind for this extensive menu.  I suspect once you've become a \"regular\" this all becomes a non-issue.  

Lastly, I find Sonic to be a bit pricey as fast food goes.  This too may be due to my lack of familiarity with their menu as it is easy to drop over $20.00 for two adults and a child.  This brings me back to the menu thing again, sorry, but be sure to check out the child's menu otherwise you will be buying a much larger burger than most kids can consume in one sitting.  Speaking of burgers, I love Sonic's burger but I am not a fan of their buns...reminds of the hamburger buns that were served in Elementary school and Junior High...in my humble opinion, Sonic's hamburger buns are just something to keep your hands from getting greasy/covered with the various condiments as opposed to enhancing the overall taste of the burger.

When all is said and done, Sonic does provide a good alternative choice in the fast food category."}
{"text":"This place need better management . Whom ever is managing now does not know how to properly staff nor train their staff.. I will never be back. I'm a AGM for a 400 seat restaurant with much more standers then what sonic would be. But you can at least train your staff to work smarter and more efficient then what this staff is.. every time I've come I sit forever if they have one or two cars it takes FOREVER!! Idk if the manager doesn't have proper staffing or they don't care if these kids move or not... Waiting 15-20 mins in the heat you tend to loss your appetite.. Bottom line this is horribly managed!!  Not too mention your profits would be much higher!  I watched 4 cars pull away by the time I decided to join them!  All while he original car sat at the ordering station!!! Super annoying!!! This not first time experiencing this but it will be my last!!!"}
{"text":"It took 20 minutes to go through the drive through because they were taking so long. And that was with multiple cars in front of me leaving. Meanwhile one of the employees went outside to take a cigarette break."}
{"text":"I just left this sonic after waiting close to 1 hour and there wasn't even that many people there.  When we finally get to the window, they had our order WRONG.  Never again. Go to the one on Nellis it's a lot faster and they're more competent there."}
{"text":"If my other half wasn't in love with their ice t and the weird little ice balls, I would never go to this location. (It's very convenient to where we live) 

Service here is awful. How can their be something wrong or messed up every single time I stop in to get her tea?!

No pretzel buns for their special pretzel hot dogs. I was going to try one. Scratch that. Also I was charged twice for my order. I even had it up on my phone to show the girl and she said it only went thru once. Hmmm okay. 

I'm just not a fan of sonic. Over the years I feel like they have gone downhill."}
{"text":"I can't complain too much about any Sonic. If you are in the mood for yummy and greasy food that hits the spot for that afternoon bite this is the place. We ended up getting some custard  concretes and slushies and some super yummy chicken wings and hot dogs. The prices are always right and they have happy hour and morning specials on slushies and such. The line always seems to be a bit long and hence my only dismay."}
{"text":"I frequent this Sonic for my morning soda fix and so enjoy the manager at this location.  He is very nice and always makes my day brighter."}
{"text":"The happy hour at Sonic Drive-In is what makes Sonic standout over the other fast food restaurants.  You just have to be patient for the line of cars during this time.  I was fortunate to pull up to the window at 5pm--the last customer.  Sonic relives the past with its rollerskating service and yes the slushes are out of this world--just sip slow otherwise you get that once to often brainfreeze--strawberry slush with strawberries, yes!  Sonic is definitely a must"}
{"text":"The past 2 nights I've went to this location and I've never been so disappointed. Let me start off by saying their drive thru is incredibly SLOW. I was there for 20+ minutes each night. They focus on other items instead of going in the order they came in. While sitting and waiting I see they have CHEMICALS sitting on a table they serve food on! 1. A sanitizer bucket 2. A spray bottle filled with some sort of yellow substance. I've contacted their Twitter page, & corporate but they don't seem to have a care in the world. Be careful when you eat there, you might have extra flavor in your food!"}
{"text":"Out of ice cream...so disappointed. I love the shakes here so it's a tough pill to swallow when I make a trip over on my day off. I feel bad for the employees who have to tell everyone this over and over, I guess it's the flip side of their great summer sale on shakes. The managers on the other hand need to do their jobs since this isn't the first time this has happened to me here, just the first time I made a trip to specifically get a shake. 
I went to Jack in the Box afterwards to #makeminemilkshake"}
{"text":"First off I was having a hard time ordering because the print is so small and trying to look into the sun I was having a really hard time. The lady wouldn't help me by telling me what hotdogs they offered so I just went by the picture. 
     Second, yes part my fault, but instead of driving straight and parking in the sun I went to the right and parked in the shade. There were no other cars except the one behind me. I'm 8 months pregnant and I sure don't want to be any hotter than I am. I tried signally the lady when she came out by honking, yelling 'miss' a million times and waving my hands. Btw it is only about 10 feet away from where she was. 
      She finally looked up after the car behind me said it wasn't theirs and saw me waving my hands at her. She came to my car and without saying hi, or any nice comment, she immediately tells me 'that if I was going to park here I should have told someone' in a very rude tone. Sorry it was a last minute decision. I did explain to her that I was trying to get her attention but she must have not heard me. Her reason to me was that she is deaf... But she has no hearing aids, no speech impairment and it seemed like she could hear me pretty clearly while I spoke to her without her looking at my face. I then tell her I'm sorry I didn't know that she was deaf. Her response is 'yea no one knows that I am' in a rude sarcastic tone. 
      I didn't need to have someone rude and sarcastic give me smart remarks because she would have to walk ten more feet to my car. That was my first time there and my last since not one person could be nice at a customer service based restaurant. I don't know your menu and rules and don't order fast food all that much so you should help a person that is not accustomed to your everyday life. 
     Learn some manners and customer service if not it's the wrong job for you!!!"}
{"text":"My friend told me about the funniest fast-food experience of his life..and it happened at Sonics. He explained that they had ordered a few smoothies and the Sonics server rollerskated to their car and spilled an entire smoothie onto the side of their car lol...poor guy. Then the server took another couple of trips to bring another smoothie and towels to wipe down the car...but would forget things like the towel, etc so it took a loong time. Mmm..is this guy sober? lol

friend: (joking) are you going to comp us a smoothie?
server: Yeah, I can do that. 
friend: are you going to get fired if you do?
server: Yeah, probably. 

haha this guy is hilarious. So my friend took me to the exact location the same day because I have never tried Sonics in my life. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and foot-long coney with a slushie. Besides the cheap prices (especially during happy hour) I don't find anything great to reel me back to this joint. Jack in the crack is still going to be my #1. My first experience was kind of disappointing, but I would be down to give it another try."}
{"text":"Two attempts to get the food we ordered. Not a smooth running process. Carhops not checking on orders after delivered. Bathrooms a bit on the yucky side. Been to  a lot of well run Sonics. This one could use a refresher on service and cleanliness. Food was okay."}
{"text":"Been there twice in the last couple of weeks. Got there way before 8pm, not looking for the half price shakes, just wanted food for me and my daughter. Had to wait over 20 minutes each time to get our food. They didn't look to busy. But to wait 20 minutes for fast food is way to long. No special order. Looked like enough help, but maybe to much playing going on instead of getting the food out to the customer. Will be a long while until I go back if ever."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been here. First time I received service right away. The second time I just left because no one ever answered when I pushed the red button. There were no customers at the location and I waited for 15 minutes. Today, the third time, I had to switch parking spots just to be answered. Then, I could hear that I wasn't being paid any attention because the man was messing up my order. Then was asked if my order on the screen was correct. I could not see my order. I went to pay and the balance was jacked by $21. I put my card in and nothing. This place is poorly run and I do not know why management or corporate hasn't stepped in. This is killing the Sonic brand."}
{"text":"I love Sonic drive-ins and have eaten at Sonic all my life.  Today I stopped in to pick up a supersonic cheese burger and tots.  Got home, I'm sitting on the couch enjoying my burger...which was really great until...I had eaten nearly half of the burger when I bit into the tomatoes and at first thought it was just a stringy tomato until as I was pulling it out of my mouth...to my realization the stringy thing i had bitten into was actually a blonde hair.   YUCK!  YUCK! YUCK!!! Since my head is shaved and the hair was in the middle of the burger, it could have only gotten into my burger while it was being prepared.  Had it not been for the hair, this would have been 4 stars."}
{"text":"Well this is one of those places that's open 24 hours where I can still get something other than breakfast. I pulled up and the young lady greeted me as she should and was very in tune & attentive although we were only talking thru a speaker. I could tell she had that great customer service that I still look forward to.

I ordered the footlong (yes footlong) chili cheese coney dog, fries, and a strawberry lemonade. Well the fries weren't that great and were kind of stale. Seemed as if they had been sitting out and heated up by putting it in the grease again. Being that I love french fries so much I can always tell good ones from bad ones and these were bad. Ugh!!!! The chili cheese dog was truly awesome. The bread was fresh and the hot dog & chili appeared to be fresh cause they were both very very tasty. I mean this hot dog is HUGE and MEATY and was truly a footlong. The strawberry lemonade was made to perfection. It was made with fresh strawberries and oh my I'm officially hooked!!! And just enough of that yummy ice leftover for me to chew on is a bonus.

So despite my not so fresh fries I will probably return however I won't be seeking this out but more of a convenience."}
{"text":"Well I should have read three reviews before coming here for $1 chili cheese dogs. I've been in the drive thru 20 minutes now and still haven't gotten to the window to pay for or even get my food. The car in front of me took 10 minutes to order. Not sure if it's the service or the person ordering!!! Then get up to the window and she still repeating my damn order wrong! I don't even wanna wait for the food to review this place!!!! 

Does management even read the reviews of their establishment and try to correct it? Everything is pretty consistent so it's not just 1 pissed of customer it's consistent with everyone!!! 

I will be taking my lazy ass to the grocery store so I can cook in my own home. It's still close to the 1st of the month and all the food stamp recipients buy every item in the store in multiples. I'm not putting anyone down who receives assistance but they frustrate me too!!!"}
{"text":"Sonic overall is not a bad fast food stop.  I don't eat hamburgers so I can't review them.  The grilled chicken wrap has always been a go to grab for me.  It's easy to eat and I don't feel guilty about eating fast food. It has grilled chicken, ranch dressing, lettuce and tomato in a wrap.

I have never cared much for their breakfast items.  Not sure why.  Maybe it's because I think fast food breakfast is ridiculous.  Why buy an egg?

Today I tried the grilled chicken flat bread melt (grilled chicken, bacon, cheese, grilled onions & BBQ sauce).  It was bigger than I expected.  Overall it wasn't that bad.  I thought the cheese didn't go with it nor did the grilled onions.  The bacon was rubbery which is unpleasant. The BBQ sauce had a good flavor as did the grilled chicken.  Personally I think this would be good in a wrap.  The grilled chicken, BBQ sauce and some lettuce and tomato would be really good."}
{"text":"During the day this place is perfectly fine but at night they close a whole hour earlier than what's posted. I get off of work at 11 and they're the closest location to my house and every time I check they're time it says midnight but when I get there they're closed..."}
{"text":"Although my order was slightly wrong,  they remade the order and threw in extra add on.  Also fast and courteous. Comparatively, I choose this location instead of Windmill store because they have consistently slow /poor service. We'll be back here."}
{"text":"Love their drinks! I recommend the strawberry and cherry slash! Love their jalapeño peppers. You should come shake this place out."}
{"text":"I love this Sonic in Walmart. The employees are always courteous and friendly. I never once had any problem with them. I go there about 5 times a week for half-price drinks and sometimes half-price milkshakes. It's a fast food restaurant, sometimes they have miscommunication but overall the quality of food and service is up to par. Thank you."}
{"text":"With all the shakes and drinks you can order how can you not rate Sonic at least 4 stars right? I used to BINGE on Sonic when I would come home on leave because they didnt have it where I was stationed. Now that I've served my time and I'm back home I've taken this wonderful place for granted! I'm sorry Sonic and I'm yelping to make my ammends! Chocolate Malt FTW!!"}
{"text":"If you like fast food, you will love Sonic.  If you like eating in your car and having the stench of grease linger for days, you will also love Sonic.  I love comfort food as much as the next person, but the food here is too greasy and bland to make me want to recline my seat and dribble ketchup all over the upholstery.  The food I've had at Sonic has been cold and tasteless, though it was at least served to me with a smile.  The coffee is the stuff you get from a cappuccino machine at a gas station.  The only reason I'll return is to add a few vodka nips to a cherry lemonade slush, and that won't be until the temperature reaches at least 50."}
{"text":"I tried Sonic again with my mom after years of her saying it was awful and nothing special. We were hoping that it was better. Nope not at all. The food is not that great. Just microwaved frozen food. I wasn't expecting a lot but it's the kind of food you eat and 5 min later your stomach is churning in agony. The shakes we ordered were watery, all melted. We asked for a new one and it was the same thing. Rather get a shake at mcdonalds. It was so gross. I can't even imagine what the slushes are like if the shake is all melted. Also the employees are so rude. Absolutely no customer service training."}
{"text":"DAMMIT SONIC! WHY aren't you in Los Angeles? Your greasy goodness has me feenin! I usually come to visit as the first stop after landing at PHX when visiting my best friend. We order like 5 things and share them all, usually followed by about 6 hours of gas pains - but it's hella worth it.
My friend did, however, recently inform me that you took the Frito burrito off the menu! WHAT THE FUCK!? Come ON! It's a freakin chili burrito with nacho cheese and FRITOS inside! Who doesn't want that?? Put it back on the menu ASAP or I will stick around after my meal and share my stinky wrath with you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't review the food since I never got my order. I waited for almost an hour for a couple hot dogs on my lunch break. When it got to where I was 30 minutes late back to work I left. I saw a few other people leaving for the same reason. Fortunately some customers got their food in a few minutes and were on their way. The staff didn't care when I asked why it was taking so long. Maybe they don't like the way I look or something..."}
{"text":"This is literally the SLOWEST \"fast food\". Today at noon, I waited for 30 minutes for 2 mini-hotdogs and a SMALL pop corn chicken, the cook was outside smoking a cigarette while I waited and decided to leave before ever receiving my food. Literally no excuse for that wait time. And literally no one communicated a long wait either!"}
{"text":"Honestly I'm a pretty patient person, but when I order from a fast food place In a drive through 15 minutes waiting is ridiculous. I got there at 12:15 and ordered I didn't get my food for over 20 minutes... And i know popcorn chicken doesn't take 20 minutes. I asked for buffalo sauce and ranch for my dip upon ordering my food. Once they got to my vehicle the lady told me they were out of ranch once I checked my bag and made sure my sauces were in there and asked again. Then they told me they were out of buffalo and handed me a cup of buffalo. Just to find out they infact were not out of either sauce when a friend of mine went to the same location after me... Honestly pissed I waisted my lunch break on this place"}
{"text":"This visit I wanted to see who I could call and complain to... And then I thought to myself... I said \"Self, what is there to expect from a Sonic\". Yet if you have to question what type of service you should expect ANYWHERE there's an issue there. But hey, for a place that changes their high school staff almost every other week and manages to leave something out of your order every time ... It's open. And I'm here so it is what it is, blue raspberry nerds slushy or the lemon berry slushy keep me happy."}
{"text":"Well I hadn't been here for maybe 6 months and I live in Streetsboro. If you read my last review it was not kind.

So I go to the Drive-thru around 8:00 pm. A car had just pulled around to the window in front of me and the employee on the speaker says \"just one moment please\" which is perfectly reasonable.

So literally 3 minutes go by with no response and now 2 more cars have pulled in behind me. I say \"HELLO ARE YOU READY?\" no response. I wait another 2 minutes now 5 minutes total and say \"HELLO?\" very loudly almost yelling and no response. Approx another minute and an employee comes walking down the sidewalk to my vehicle and says \"Oh we didn't know there was a vehicle there\". Now there are 4 vehicles in line behind me. She asks me to pull forward to the window to place my order.

I ordered 2 corn dogs a shake and a slushy. I wait more and finally get my food. When I pull away I look down and they have given me 2 CONEY Dogs not Corn Dogs. I was too angry to go back.

2 of the cars in line pulled out and drove off while waiting. This will be the LAST TIME I spend money here."}
{"text":"I love there malts and not to sure on the rest of the food need to order more then a malt."}
{"text":"Stopped by and ordered a Caramel Custard Concrete made with Snickers Bars. It didn't have caramel or Snickers. I spent $5+ for a vanilla shake. This is one of the worst Sonics around here. Any time I've been there my order is always wrong. Steer clear."}
{"text":"This is the slowest drive thru in the history of drive up service. Seriously it is literally 20 minutes with hardly any business. They need to make some changes. 

Update: I gave it another chance. 22 minutes for 4 drinks and a couple of corn dogs!  I hope to all the is holy that management reads this. You are broken and need fixed."}
{"text":"The sonic was not open for business / no one responded to me at the drive-thru at 620am. I waited until 633am and even knocked on their front door. The hours of operation state 6am-11pm ? The music was playing, but no one seemed to be there?! Very disappointed ! Apparently they don't want my money!"}
{"text":"I wanted a snack last night so I stopped by Sonic. They have some tables outside so I ordered at the walk-up order station thing. After 5 minutes of looking over the long ass menu, this is what I ordered:

Cheddar Peppers
Jr. Fritos Chili Cheese Wrap
Medium Fresh Fruit Slush - Strawberry

Total + tax= $6.03

Everything was good. It was very entertaining watching the guy who brings out the food orders flying by on roller skates. I wonder if he has ever fell and all the food goes flying...LOL

Drinks are half off between 2-4pm"}
{"text":"If you want to repeat yourself FIVE times and still get your ordered wrong, yes please by all means choose this location. I understand this job has to be really rough, but to get an attitude with your customers is probably not your best move."}
{"text":"I have never lived in such close proximity to a Sonic before so you can imagine my excitement when I found this location. We made it a point to stop here for drinks when we were out on the weekends. Service was slow, but employees were always so kind and our drinks were always made perfectly. 

The one time that I decided to order food, I got food poisoning. I have not been back since."}
{"text":"I prefer this Westside location normally because the order is usually correct. This time the extra ice was missed, I asked for mustard & got nada but they threw on cheese I didn't pay for so obviously someone else got my burger. I'm sure they weren't thrilled. It's Sonic what are ya gonna do right?"}
{"text":"Terrible! These employees are useless, everytime there's something wrong with my order. Avoid this location at all cost."}
{"text":"Yeah this is the worst sonic ever cold food way to over cooked burgers employees blasting music you can hear it over the ordering speaker close this place down"}
{"text":"We have been there many times I from 8pm to 11 pm. This is the worst I have ever seen for a restaurant ( Sonic ). SLOW, the girl at the window needed change and  the guy was busy on his iPhone  looked at her like don't bother me. Took for ever to get 2  Bergers. The owner should take a good look at who is working for him. If this is the best he can do he better look at himself SAD."}
{"text":"Seriously needs new management!  For some reason I keep stoping back in and every time it's terrible.  My order has been wrong 4/5 times and the time they got it right my burger was so greasy and smashed I couldn't even eat it.  I like Sonic as a chain and this one is right next to my house and I can't stomach going back.  

To the owner:  HIRE NEW STAFF!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this Sonic is so inconsistent. I went last night to get a chocolate malt and there was no line in the Drive Thur ,but they made me wait to take my order anyways. This happens here all the time for some reason? Not a big deal but, my real compliant is the malt. It was so runny and watery I couldn't drink it. It was so gross! The same person made me my malt 3 days ago and it was great. I don't get it. And this is like the 3rd time this has happened to me here. This Sonic is so close for me. I hope this can be fixed or I will have to switch to the Boulder Hwy location. I don't seem to have these issues there ever."}
{"text":"Once again, no iced tea and (even though sometimes the woman taking my order offers to take 2 mins and brew me some) the person working at 12:30 am on 8/18/2015 clearly couldn't be bothered. Guess you don't need my business."}
{"text":"I love their limeade.   Old school drive in.   Some time you are waited on by teens in skates.  50s style.  The Chicago dog is awesome and very affordable.  Yum."}
{"text":"2 stars VS. 1??? because they actually have really good shakes. The downside is that service is incredibly sloooooww. You will actually wait at the drive through window for 5 or more minutes and no one asks for your order. Or you can do what I do and drive straight to the cashier window which is where the workers may or may not be laughing and playing grab ass with each other in the back. Sandwiches are bland and actually look like they were sat on when you pull them out of the bag. Just stick with the shakes, especially coconut cream pie 
and you will be alright. Just be prepared to wait awhile."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 I would. How does someone read your order back to you perfectly when you've asked them to do so, and you can get home and it's COMPLETELY WRONG, and the messed up order made my meals more expensive than it should've been to add!"}
{"text":"Another trip, another wrong order. How can someone repeat my order back to me Again on another trip and get it totally wrong. Ohhhh and I just paid almost 9$ and you forgot my fries as well."}
{"text":"I don't think us Northerners are ready for Sonic. Everyone here seemed really, really confused. This is fast food people. It should pander to the lowest form of humanity. Perhaps that is why my friend and I had such trouble with the outside menu...we are of the highest intelligence, natch. We knew the place would be packed in the opening month, but all we wanted was a couple of drinks. 
Problem #1: He only had cash. Can we use cash on the outside electronic ordering menu machine? It did not seem possible. Yet, there were a couple of blue hairs having lunch on the outside dining table. We all know blue hairs don't trust debt or credit cards, so they must have paid cash. But how? I was even a project manager on installing the electronic debt machines on a string of Sonics throughout the south in a former life and even I didn't know the answer.

Problem #2: The car hops wear roller skates. There is no way I could have enjoyed my food watching grown men degraded by wearing roller skates and sailing, unhappily, from the Sonic to people too lazy to get out of their cars. I mean, your thoughts are automatically brought to the stinking economy and thinking about how these men were once management of some auto part supplier who lost his job so long ago he isn't even factoring into our sky-high unemployment rates so he was forced to strap on roller skates at a Parma Sonic. Eeeh Gads! This is not what I want to think about on my lunch break. 

Problem #3: Once we finally figured out how to signal some service we waited a few minutes before someone came over the loudspeaker indicating something. We aren't sure what. We guessed the crackly voice said we would have to wait a few more minutes for someone to take our order. 

I haven't felt this confused since McCain announced Palin as his running mate. WTF."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Sonic so we stopped. Should have kept going. Only got 2 drinks and a medium fry. The frozen limeades weren't even mixed. Just kinda thrown together, and the medium fries were almost $3 for a quarter of the size of McD's. Ended up throwing away the drinks since they tasted terrible."}
{"text":"Normally I love this sonic, and come almost everyday and have even learned the names of most of the employees! And I'm not complaining about the restaurant, im complaining about one employee in specific who gave a me a terrible experience today. I pull into my stall and push the button and expect the usual cheery, warm introduction i usually get from some of my favorite employees like chandler, Kara, Michael, Dawson, Brooke, chambrielle, Lauren, Will, etc. who always have a great tone of kindness in their voice and always ask how I am. But this time I was greeted by a flat, monotonous voice or an employee who truly sounded like he'd rather be anywhere else. His name (as I read off of his name tag when he later served me) was Daylon. Normally the basic intro is somewhere along the lines of \"Welcome to sonic my name is___, how are you doing? \" this time it was \"my name is daylon, how can I help you?\" I brushed it off and asked him how his day was going to which he rudely responded \"what can I get started for you\" and all my gosh let me tell you how slow he is. I only ordered one thing a number one combo with medium fries and a medium Coke. A pretty simple order right? You wouldn't think so given that it took nearly four minutes just to ring it up. And to top it all off unlike the usual good employees who read off your order to you he just told me my total and hung up quickly. Part two. So I'm waiting for my food to get out and I get the normal screen that says \"your car hop is on their way with your order\" and usually after that screen pops up the friendly smiling carhop was at my car within 10 to 15 seconds. Not this time. From the time that screen popped up it was about 2 1/2 minutes until, lo and behold, daylon finally appears at my car window with a blank, bored look on his face. Normally any decent car hop will ask you how your day is going, say their name,  and read off every detail of your order to make sure it was 100% correct. Once again not this time. Without even saying his name he simply asked, in his cold, droning voice \"did you have the number one?\" He didn't even go into detail to make sure that my order was right. And even after this whole experience I gave him a dollar and a half tip. Now usually when you tip a carhop they smile and give you a warm, grateful thank you. Daylon did not so much as crack a smile. And before any decent car hop goes back inside they ask if I need anything else and if not they bid me a good day. Daylon, without saying a word, simply turns around and walks away. It hurts me to give you guys such a bad review and if you want my honest opinion, to avoid in the future, FIRE DAYLON."}

{"text":"Sonics are like Cook Outs, always in random locations scattered across the city. Needing some comfort food today, I went through thir drive through and got a little snack of their tots with a cherry Slush. I was bummed because it was 10 minutes before their half price drinks started from 2 to 4P every day) but oh well, I guess I can put down $1.89 for a slush. I don't know what they fry their tots in but they were the best tots of my life. And this girl has consumed many a tot in her day."}
{"text":"To be honest I rarely ever ever eat fast food, but the hubby came home late and we had few choices of open places. So here I am...I'm giving it one star not because of the food but because of the service. When you decide to hire young, ignorant, I don't give a damn employees, they give you crap service.

The owners of this establishment really needs to better train not only staff but obviously Management as well. 

I'm sorry but your employees act, look and talk like ghetto trash...I apologize for the name calling but it is what it is."}
{"text":"Waiting over 15 minutes for burgers, some chicken poppers, fries and a shake. Once it came, the fries and chicken obviously had been sitting out for awhile. Burger was extremely dry and barely above room temperature. Near flavorless. Shake was the only thing that was good. Won't bother going back here again. Go to Culver's that is less expensive, fresher, better food, cleaner, and better in about every category."}
{"text":"YUMMMMM. I LOVE Sonic and I'm sad that we have to go so far to enjoy it :(

This one was great though! Staff was friendly enough and the food was delicious as always!

20 minute drive from the hotel we stayed at on Lake Mead (Hacienda Hotel), and totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"Oh Sonic, how I love thee.  How sad I am that you haven't made it to NY yet.  But I get my fix of you whenever I am in Vegas.

Seriously.  I usually stop here as soon as I get into town.  Like, I'm on my way from the airport.   C'mon  you would too if you only at it like once or twice a year.

Sonic Burger + Onion Rings (or Tots, I mean, cmon ... TOTS!) + Cherry Limeade = Very Happy Dave.  

I've never had a problem with service there, although I'm usually there mid-afternoon, or late night at the drive through."}
{"text":"Sonic has some great burgers and shakes. Oh and don't for get the tatter tots. Sometimes you just want tatter tots. I haven't been in while because the service can be a little spotty. It has gotten a little better. If you don't like your job or are stressed out please don't take it out on the customer. We just want an awesome burger and some tatter tots. If you don't like your job go find a new one there are plenty of them out there. But while you are there do your best and try and be nice to people. It took me awhile to learn that lesson. I know how it is.
Supersonic Cheeseburger with mustard! So good. All the food is good. Even the grilled cheese on the giant Texas toast is good. I will keep going here and put up with the slightly off the mark service sometimes because the food is so good."}
{"text":"For real.... How hard is it to get simple orders correct. I'm not the only one in my family having this issue. I refuse to go to sonic anymore I can not handle the disappointment of an incorrect order."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for happy hour with the kids. Got my drinks delivered by a gentlemen named Michael H. He gave us  great customer service. The store manager should be proud. 5 stars for this employee!!!"}
{"text":"By far the SLOWEST fast food restaurant in the world! The workers here must be special. They get the orders wrong most of the time! I once ordered a hamburger and was told they only sell cheeseburgers without cheese! I asked \"what's a cheeseburger without cheese called?\" Her reply...a hamburger! I once ordered a breakfast sandwich with egg and bacon and got a bacon double cheeseburger! The manager said...\"at least we got the bacon right!\" Everyone should be fired and start fresh."}
{"text":"I've tried numerous times to give this place another chance. It pains me to write a negative review, but at this point, the service is just plain terrible. When my order was read back to me at the window, something was wrong so I told the girl what it was supposed to be and she rolled her eyes at me. I told her forget it that it was fine. We got our order and left. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Never eat there!! They give you small portions like half of sizes of what you're suppose to get. Most of the time the food is not even cooked right or the girl taking your order is more busy socializing with coworkers rather then making sure your meal is complete and I don't have to come back again!!
Sonic has gone down big time!! Sad, because I used to love that place"}
{"text":"hi hello I was trying to buy a dr. Pepper diet on my doc diabetic that kind of killed me how would you like it to be served in a regular dr. Pepper for Ada signs I'm very hurt by that I cannot even do that to somebody that fight manslaughter"}
{"text":"I had never been to Sonic before moving to Vegas 3 years ago and the only reason I went was because DQ didn't have footlongs and Sonic does. Now I pop over there whenever I want a milkshake. And I like the car hops, who sometimes wear roller skates."}
{"text":"Having been exposed to the commercials on infinite loop, my son and I were anxious to give Sonic a try when we were home for a visit this week (we don't have one in Manhattan). Service was patient and friendly, food was decent by fast food standards (chili dogs were comparable to Coney Island), and was ready quickly, and the Coconut Creme milkshake was the absolute bomb! We dined in, since it was our first time and we didn't know the menu, but we'll definitly be back and next time we'll give the drive-in a go."}
{"text":"I love some grilled cheese but when you order one you expect the bread to be toasted. WTF PPL It's a GRILLED cheese!"}
{"text":"I love sonics shakes, but the last few times I've gone. Over the course of maybe 2 months I usually wait in line for about 15-20 mins until I decide to drive off like others have. I don't understand if you are always understaffed, buts it's never really busy and the lines are still ridiculous and dont move."}
{"text":"One of if not the worst Sonic Drive-In's I have been to.  Both times took a really long time and they asked me to pull out front so others behind me could get there food first.  I didn't realize that my burger, tots, and drink took longer than the four cars behind me.  Both times the burger and tots were cold as if they had been sitting.  The buns were stale and they brought the wrong order twice.  Someone there doesn't seem to know what they are doing.  This area seems to be lacking for fast food."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve the one star I'm giving them. We waited for 37 minutes and ended up leaving with no food. The service is a joke, and the attitudes of the employees working is horrible. When we asked for a manager, an individual named Sammy came out. His attitude was just as bad, and only seemed to change his tune when asked for phone numbers of his supervisors. After driving 5 hours and having to deal with them we ended up eating at McDonald's. These employees made Californians look like SAINTS. I visit Phoenix quite frequently, and can honestly say, I will NEVER return to this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"The food shall not be mentioned by me because I never eat here.  Nothing even looks like it wouldn't make me vomit, we won't even go there.  What I want to talk about is shakes.  Amazing, delicious shakes.  My new fave is the bourbon brown sugar creamery shake.  Or the dulce de leche.  Or the buttered toffee.  Sometimes straight vanilla bean if I'm in the mood.  I liked the lavender berry all right, but spent the rest of the night digging blackberry seeds out of my teeth.  You might want to skip that one if you're on a date or something.  The only thing to visit Sonic for is desert of the ice cream variety.  And they're half price after 20:00! Even better.  Most locations are open until 22:00 or thereabouts.  Later on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"Great service! We usually get the drinks and ice cream! I like also how there are card machines on every stall. The servers have skill and they usually skate."}
{"text":"Based on order alone, and typing this realizing that in the commotion, no drinks, no receipt. I fkn hate this sonic with a goddamnned passion. Before the service sucked. Now, a dude person at the window who argued me for 30 seconds that there are SLINGERS on the menu. SLINGERs. Learn the fkn menu and learn customer service

{"text":"This place has the worst service area. Okay on yelp it says open 24 hours  so me and my wife and dog we drove there on March 26,2018 at 2:55pm I ordered chili tater tot  I looked in the bag it looked full. So when I got home I noticed that it wasn't a large there was yummy cornee of food looked like the customer reply ate my food iam so upset worse fast food service ever had paid 15$ for me and my wife don't go there late at night the cashier will eat your food and Get over on you"}
{"text":"one job - can't get it right - not the first time they gave me a single when i ordered and paid for a double. they are not quick nor friendly - totally drive to pecos & patrick where they get it right."}
{"text":"Oh god how I love Sonic. As a vegetarian it is very difficult to find good fast food, but Sonic does it at a very fair price. 

So as semi-embarrassing as it is, I order the kid's meal with grilled cheese, tater tots, and Ocean Water, a delicious blue Sprite-like soda drink. The grilled cheese is always on thick, spongy bread and made to perfection. And the tots.... oh the tots. SO good. I also ordered a snack trio that comes with mozzarella sticks, tots, and onion rings. The food came out quickly but they did forget the marinara sauce for the mozzarella sticks, but it was still delicious without. 

Sonic is always quick and easy, and the price is always nice; they even have a $1 menu now. The food is always great and they have items I totally crave in a drive-in setting that is very convenient."}
{"text":"Alright this one deserves 5 stars, YUM!

Came a little before 10 PM to get some grub with the boyfriend. Got responded to quickly, they took our order (a burger, large tots & cherry limeade for him, a grilled cheese kids meal with tots and Ocean Water for me - yes, I order the kids meal, come at me!) and literally within minutes the car hop came out and was careful to warn us about how hot the tots were in our bags (which they were, hot damn indeed!) and even came back a couple minutes later to ask us if we needed anything else. After finishing this meal, I still had a major craving for mozzarella sticks after the sub-par ones I got at the other Sonic a couple weeks ago, but these did not disappoint! I got my mozzarella sticks hot and fresh, with the freakin' marinara sauce they go along with so well. This has always been my favorite location and the customer service and food was amazing, fresh, hot, and delicious. All while sitting in the comfort of my boyfriend's Honda Fit. A great quick, filling meal and I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this location!! So the couple times I have visited this location I have not left happy! So one of the times i ordered the fried cheesecake bite things and they brought out a cheesecake shake. when i gave it back i asked would they adjust the charge since the milkshake is more than the bites she said yes, she comes back and says oh it was only a few cents different so they didn't adjust it, I knew she way lying because i know the shakes cost way more than the bites, we ate our food then i went back to the window asked for a the manager which she really didn't want to get I told him I felt like they were being dishonest because i asked about the price difference and she told me a few cents but when I looked at the menu it was like a 2.00 differene. He then offered me some coupons instead i stated i wanted my money for the difference, he then said the lady that waited on us never brought to his attention our order was wrong. We never got an appology or anything that really rubbed me the wrong way and to top it off got back to work and i was missing the dipping sauce for my cheesecake bites. The last time i visited i ordered the double burger plain and when they brought it out she was like here is your mayo burger, i was like i didn't order a mayo burger i ordered a plain burger. Not once did we get an im sorry and we had to wait for our burgers and it almost seemed like they just wiped the mayo off put some heat on the burger and brought it back out. I think a big issue is both times our order was taken it was by a latina who i don't think understood english well because we always have to repeat our order more than once i have not been back i refuse to give my money to a buisness that has no customer service nor do they appologize for their mistakes. I may try another location but this one was closest to my job as why i frequented this one but no more! If you want sonic i advise not to go to this one find another location"}
{"text":"My fiance and I arrived roughly around 1020 and ended up leaving at 1105 without our order. No one bothered to check up on us and I was too pissed off after waiting more than 40 minutes to even dare ask. The car that arrived at 1055 got their order within 10 minutes and that's what pissed us off the most.  I have a feeling the kid never registered our order to begin with as it doesn't take 40 minutes to at least make a shake."}
{"text":"If I could select no stars I would. This place is dirty all over and you could see if from the drive-thru window. They only have 1-2 people working and the drive-thru super full. I've been to this Sonic location many times and I've never had a problem until recently. My husband got very sick from eating one of the hotdogs on their menu. He has been throwing up all day.. It is vary rare for him to get sick so this must be due to the cleanliness or maybe even wasn't made right due to the rush of the employees because there was only 2 workers. Won't be getting any food from this location ever again."}
{"text":"This is first sit down sonic I have been to.  It is okay.  The service on the inside is more of a take your order and move on kind of thing.  I think I prefer the drive in.

Food is still Sonicgood."}
{"text":"Woohoo! Sonic! Never fails me. We actually ate here TWICE during our stay in Vegas because we didn't want to spend money and didn't want to leave the hotel (we stayed at the Rio) because we had to meet a friend flying in the next night. Both nights I got the cheeseburger with tots. I totally recommend coming here for happy hour 2-4 pm to get 1/2 half off slushys and then take them back to your hotel and add alcohol. I brought some grand marnier to vegas and added that to my slushy and it was pretty darn good and cheap! It was pretty busy the second night we came here but they were short staffed and apologized for the long wait. I like the guy in the rollerblades cruisin around asking customers if they want any sauce. Good times!"}
{"text":"I hated Sonic food in general.

The servers were nice and the food came quickly though.  Dont know what else you can expect."}
{"text":"Tonight, Friday July 14, 2017, I just got a craving for a chilli dog!! Tried Sonic. Ordered it with saurkraut and no cheese, tots, and Diet Dr. Pepper with light ice. All this arrived just as I ordered and it was tasty. Hubby ordered chicken strips with fries and a drink and he liked it too. Temp was right and it was fast. They are now open till midnight on Fri. and Sat. Sheesh, don't mean to sound like a commercial but for us all went well. The cost was a little more than we pay for fast food ($16.29, then $2 tip for Olesya) but when ya crave something ya just gotta have it. We would go again. As usual, no one is influencing me to review one way or another. Also, I am offended by the question \"gender neutral restroom?\" I really don't know - wouldn't use it if there were one!!!"}
{"text":"The service here was completely out of line and terrible not to mention the food was not good at all and the bread was soggy on multiple items.. I am very disappointed...tried asking for a refund and the dumbass behind the counter gave me .11!!  Insulting. Never going back to this location."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I love their food especially their burgers but they need to get their orders right! I ordered 2 large combo meals of sonic bacon cheeseburger with tater tots, coke and cherry limeade, then an order of their grilled chicken sandwich. Waited for more than 15mins for my food to come just to see that they messed up my order! I got 2 med drink, 1 tater tot, and did not even gave me the chicken sandwich! So i complained on the guy that gave me the food, he didn't even let me finish and just said \"let me fix that for you\" then left. So i had no choice but to push the button again and tell them their mistakes on the order. And as expected, the guy who didn't made me finish my complain just brought me another tater tot. -_- I told him that if he just let me finish he could have saved his walk. Oh well, i told him my full order in details and made him repeat the order to make sure he got it all. So i needed to wait again for my order... I'm just worried because my grandma is with me in the car and she wants to go home. After I finally get the right order, I immediately checked for any \"discrepancies\" that maybe present on my food just to make sure that they are not that rude just to get back at me for bitching at them. Oh well. Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"Woo-hoo!!

Please come to Hawaii, Sonic!! I miss you so!!

What is not to love about Sonic?? I love the slushies. All of the food items I've had are good (typical fast food but on the good side). I love that they have tator tots and grilled cheese. So yummy!

I love how you order outside while sitting in your car and can pay right there at the ordering window by credit card. It gives me the chance to eat what I ordered, and then order some more to go! Yeah I know... Fatty alert!! But hey! It's good and it's convenient!"}
{"text":"It's always time for a cherry limeade! This location has been great for me so far! I mostly visit for the drink specials and treats, but I will enjoy the good fast food sometimes, too!   

Favorite Snack: Route 44 Cherry Limeade and Jalepeno Poppers!"}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for TWO drinks, a coke and a vanilla Dr. Pepper. We left and they were BOTH REGULAR DR. PEPPERS. We called to tell them and they said we could come back and wait again. They were super rude and not willing to fix their mistake. This happened a few weeks ago and I will not come back or recommend people. Very disappointed with this location"}
{"text":"First off, FOOD POISONING. Second, worst service I've had ANYWHERE. Ice cream machine down, no cheddar peppers, and they didn't ask if we wanted dipping sauce for popcorn chicken and they didn't give us marinara sauce for our uncooked ass mozzarella sticks. Food bad. Service bad."}
{"text":"I love Sonic burgers! And, chili cheese tator tots! And, foot long chili dogs! And, onion rings! 

One thing I appreciate about Sonic are the days they offer a special price on a menu item, be it 1/2 price Burger Day or $1 Hot Dog Day.

They have a much better selection than the ordinary fast food places. This one is as good as most. Food is tasty. Service is good. No complaints. No problems."}
{"text":"First this is not a drive-in.  Located INSIDE a Walmart, the GF were both surprised to see Sonic and could not wait to get something given we had just talked about Sonic the night before.  After a pleasant shopping experience at Wally World, we celebrated the occasion with an Ocean Water and a large, cheesy tator tots.  The OW was A-OK and the tots were getting cold before we left the parking lot, however they still satisfied."}
{"text":"This particular Sonic is located just of Boulder Highway.  I have not eaten at this particular location and can only vouch for the tasty beverages.  

There is no drive-thru, so one must park and order.  In a rush this a bad thing but if you have the time not it's not really a big deal.  The carhops are friendly and arrive with a smile."}
{"text":"Headed out to Glendale in search of some other frosty treats via the yelp app.  We were met with a line that would have taken over an hour to negotiate for sweet frosty treats.  We punched out and having seen this Sonic location on our travels, the GF and I were still craving some chilled,  sugary stuff.

The line went fast enough.  The server at the squawk box was friendly enough.  The transaction was quick enough and happy enough.  The sweets.......was all that a corporation could provide with a dash of wanting more.

The happy crew was awesome, the product satisfied, and I mean just SATISFIED.  On a scale of satisfaction from one to five......it was a three.

In a pinch....this location is A-OK."}
{"text":"Terrible. Just ordered a dark chocolate concrete with Reece's and I got a vanilla with chocolate swirl mixed in and NO REECES mixed in at all!! There was ONE little pile of Reece's on top and that's all. I literally ate the 5-6 bites off of the top that had candy and threw the rest away. I won't waste my money here again!!!!"}
{"text":"We Like the food and have never had an issue. Fast, friendly service what more could you ask for from a sonics drive in. Location not in the greatest neighborhood but, don't let that fool you the kids who bring the food out hAve always been friendly and super quick. Love 1/2 price drinks for happy hour. Just had the new nerd and jolly rancher slushes the kids loved them."}
{"text":"I go to Sonic so I can get my fix of tots, jalapeño poppers, and a nice sandwich of chicken. The drinks are nice too. So I pop in to this location and without explanation or apology, the young lady inside says they are not serving fried food tonight ... Anything fried ... No tots, no poppers, no chicken tenders, nothing ... I wasn't in the mood for just a burger, so I thought, hey ... those pretzel dogs look yummy, nope ... spurned again ... they hadn't thawed out any buns. No I'm sorry, no \"our fryer broke down\". 

Sorely disappointing."}
{"text":"I've literally been here 3 times in a row and been to about 4-5 of their drive-in spots didn't work. Pressed the red button 3 times in each space and nobody answered. I understand if they don't work but if they don't put an out of order sticker on them. This place sucks. A lot. But hey, it's sonic. Not setting the bar too high."}
{"text":"One of the worst drive-thru experience ever!!!!!  We have repeat our orders 5x.   Turn on ur volume on ur head phone should be the first priority.   The girl take care of the drive thru need to relearn how to work at the drive-thru.  Haven't been to sonic before, will go to another location next time.  FYI be ready to repeat your order over and over."}
{"text":"Every employee was hanging outside and when I pulled up they looked devastated that a customer came to order food. But I find it pretty disturbing that I saw multiple employees pet dogs while working. I hope you wash your hands when you go back inside handling food!"}
{"text":"The food and drink were good but there service sucks. We pulled into a stall and pushed the button 3 times with no answer. We then pulled in and went to the window where they swore we couldn't have pushed the button because they were all working correctly and it had to be our fault. Customer service doesn't exist at this store."}
{"text":"Food was alright, customer service? Not so much. Either train the boys better or hire some women."}
{"text":"Stopped by here since it's so hot out! Slushie machine was broken  I got a master blast instead and simply asked for half price since I couldn't get a slush which was half off at the time and they just said no. I understand but after the very very long wait in the drive thru you think they would offer something. The spicy bacon dog was pretty gross too, soggy. The mozzarella sticks were the only good thing I received. I asked for a peanutty snickers blast and I got a regular snickers blast..."}
{"text":"Did a quick drive thru order today. Got a small chocolate shake a popping candy slush a strawberry ice cream  slush and an ocean water. The drive thru hop guy was so nice. Very clear talking and just polite! We will be back for lunch or dinner sometime. Love me a grilled cheese or sonic burger!!!"}
{"text":"yummmmm road tripping food! (and if there was a sonic near where I lived, I bet I would love it for all the time too!)"}
{"text":"Remind me never to drive thru here again. If I check-in again - shoot me. I'm not a huge fan of Sonic, except I like their limeades and crushed ice. I've never been to this location before and I won't recommend it.

The service was fine. The gentleman who took our order was patient and nice. However, whoever prepared the food didn't prepare it as we ordered it. I asked for no mayo and got mayo. That pretty much ruins the burger. How can you take mayo off? Yuck. My daughter's chicken whatevers (bits? pieces? nuggets?) caused her to ask \"Is this chicken?\" She's 10, and not that picky. So that must have been pretty bad.

I thought it interesting that the drive thru guy encouraged me to fill out the survey to be entered for a drawing for a free something or other. Why? Because he didn't give my daughter any honey mustard sauce after he attentively asked how many packets she wanted. I usually don't fill out those surveys. I may start now...

Nice drive-thru guy. But absent-minded (I suppose we all have those days.)
Good slushes and limeade. (This would be the only reason I'd come back.)
Bad food."}
{"text":"Cold, slow, tasteless food.  Worst sonic I've been to."}
{"text":"Just rolled in to get a quick small vanilla milkshake, which was pretty good size for 2 bucks. The milkshake itself just tasted like plain soft serve ice-cream, but I honestly wasn't expecting much to begin with. Nothing special, nothing bad really."}
{"text":"I had no complaints yesterday when I came through, 20 minutes before close and our shakes looked sad, no whip, not filled to the top or anything. And the corn dogs were completely flattened(and I mean SQUISHED)  I did not mind one bit, honestly, everything was delicious. (We did not get any ketchup mustard or marinara sauce btw) But, when we came through tonight and our shakes were delivered with whip and cherries on top, and the corn dogs were perfect, and it was even done faster, I had to ask this gentleman his name.  He was spectacular. He had a great flow going, not even sure if anyone else was working or if it was just him manning the shop. Bravo Francisco! You made fast food feel like it did when it first came into existence. It was fast, top quality and you were smiling and friendly. Genuinely, thank you, because I feel every fast food worker is miserable these days and I'm always expecting a lacking visit in one way or another. Will definitely return, way too often, for our late night snacks. :)"}
{"text":"I stopped here on the way to help my friend move and I didn't experience any problems! Order was accurate, food came in a timely manner.  It tasted just like I expected it to taste and served hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Lousy over cooked corn dog and french fries yuck will not return it Was a good place to eat not anymore  So sad"}
{"text":"The food is always hot and the drinks are awesome, however the service isn't always the best. Today I waited 6 minutes just for my order to be taken, then another 15 minutes to get my food. That wouldn't be such a big deal on my day off but my lunch break is only 45 minutes. Sometimes the servers are kinda rude but it depends on who you get. Justin is the best server, he is always prompt and polite. He even comes to the window mid-meal to make sure I haven't ran out of napkins or sauce. Overall I would have to say that this is one of the best Sonic Drive-In's in the Gilbert area."}
{"text":"This location is the best! All the other ones always get my non complicated drink order very wrong but these guys always go above & beyond for me! Clayton is awesome."}
{"text":"The food is always pretty good but they're extremely slow and it's funny that they're considered \"fast food.\""}
{"text":"I feel a little weird writing a review for a concept like Sonic. I mean, they're effing everywhere! If you dont know what sonic is or havent been to one, you need to get off the couch more.

Let me start by saying this. Its fast food. Theres nothing too special going on here with a couple of small but very important exceptions. The food, for the most part is unexciting. Decent burger, ok chili dog. What sets Sonic apart from the rest is the fact that they have tater tots!!!! Yes folks, tater tots. I'll eat their burger just to get to those crunchy, fried tots! They have an amazing drink selection too. They're deserts and shakes are on point if you need that late night sweet tooth fix.

So, over the past week, I've seen their commercials for their new line of hot dogs. I'm a sucker for a good Chicago dog. So I decided to pop into the local sonic today to give their new Chicago Dog a shot. I went in with ZERO expectations. I was blown away! They serve an amazing Chicago Dog. Dont believe me? Check it out for yourself. Good job, sonic! You nailed it!"}
{"text":"After reading the previous reviews I was a bit concerned.  I am happy to say that we did not have the same experience.  Service was friendly and professional and food was delivered promptly,  correctly and it tasted great."}
{"text":"This location is less than a mile from my house, so needless to say it's the go-to for some easy ice cream. Overall it's pretty good for a fast food restaurant but it's rarely ever fast. It always seems to be understaffed or maybe the staff just move at their own pace. They're usually friendly though! There's an abundance of different shakes & desserts to choose from! You'll never run out of something new to try!"}
{"text":"I come to this Sonics everytime I need a cool drink. My last visit was awful, 2 drinks took 20 minutes to make and by the time I got my Lemonberry cream slush I discovered it was just flavored water and my girlfriends Nerds Slush was also just flavored water neither were cool. Rung the button again and they remade both our drinks this time mine came correctly but my girlfriends was now 50% more slush but mostly water. I gave up at that point as I didn't want to wait another 20 mins for them to remake 1 drink I went home and crushed iced and added it to her drink she was happy I was less than thrilled with Sonics that night


I don't know if I'll be able to keep going here if this keeps up. I do love the Lemonberry slush though :/"}
{"text":"Typical fast food but with hot dogs and other crap....  Nothing special...  I don't want to eat in my car...  Not worth the time / effort to visit this place."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I keep coming back to this location... Perhaps because it's the closest and I just love their drinks. But, just about every time I go order through the drive through , there's something wrong with my order. The last two times, my drink order was wrong, and before that my sister and I had issues with our food. 

I usually end up giving a sigh and hard eye roll after ordering from here."}
{"text":"Fiat time here.  Button to push for ordering.  Okay.  What is the sonic card?  Do I pay with credit card here too? Order came out.  Person didn't have change.  Waited about 7 minutes until I figured something is wrong.  As suspected, confused cashier guessed at change.  I believe they are understaffed.  There is a drivethru I noticed while leaving.  Might want to try that if to go order.  Food was cold and underwhelming.  Not horrible hence two stars"}
{"text":"OMG.. Every time I go there cause it's close and they have the best ice.. I get so aggetated and cannot believe how rude the workers are and slow! I am 100% disgusted in the way they treat their customers and always seem to mess up the order by the time you drove away.. if you go to this establishment plan on waiting at least an hour just for them screwing around and their incompetence"}
{"text":"Everyone working here is always very nice & accommodating. The food is good for the price & it's hard to beat their wide variety of shakes & slushies."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. If you are looking for something quick DO NOT go here.

I'm not quite sure what takes so long...each time I go they have at least 10 people working. 

They also do not listen at the drive thru....

Just save yourself the hassle"}
{"text":"Dine the Onion rings... Awesome n fresh.  Stayed in car, Vegas well hott 115°F. The family liked their meals n service was quick n fast."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow service even when they aren't busy. They were wrong for giving me and my children those cold corn dogs on 50 cent corn dog day. But my milkshake was really good!"}
{"text":"The worst service staff take forever to get a shake ready and they rude don't know how to be more polite and respectful I have to come her sense the closest location to me my some love the Shakes if was me I'll never come back"}
{"text":"A very beautiful Sonic but man it took the cashier about five minutes to get our order right. All we ordered was two blasts. (Nothing custom either!)"}
{"text":"No one in the parking lot and they took a long time to bring out the order. The guy taking the order was being a smart ass with my senior citizen parents. No customer service skills at all. Maybe this is why the parking lot is empty."}
{"text":"There is a guy named Dan who is there almost every morning and he is the epitome of good customer service every single time.  The food is always on point as well as the service."}
{"text":"Iffy with this sonic. Especially when it comes to their sweet tea.  Sometimes it's really good, other days it's so bitter! Taste is so nasty! They also take FOREVER to bring your order out sometimes. I'll come ten at night just a few cars and wait 20 minutes for two drinks. I'll come 7 am and again forever to get just a drink. They also don't give change! I've give them my money and they just start walking away. I have to ask for my change. Happened a few times, which is unacceptable"}
{"text":"Why do I punish myself with coming here. Never less than 20 min wait and then you get 7 tots in a large order if your lucky. Thankfully the drinks and ice cream is above par and allow for 2 stars."}
{"text":"Only gave one star because you have to! Worst service I've ever had in my entire life! I pulled up to the drive and push the button and nobody took my order for about five minutes. Stopped and went through the drive-through waited for about five minutes again and ended up leaving with nothing!"}
{"text":"Sonic is one of my favorite fast food emporiums. Albeit, I don't frequent any (Public Service Announcement: Neither should YOU, whoever is reading this) fast food locations. But when I do - I prefer tots.

The nostalgia of the rollerskating is awesome, and the awkward do-i-tip-or-not is pending, unsolved in my head. Either way the staff seems to skate long merrily.

The only thing someone should really be able to complain about is their prices, but Earth to Garth, it's still fast & relatively inexpensive. And that extra buck you paid more than golden arches across the street, I find easy to taste in increased quality."}
{"text":"Born and raised in San Jose, I have only heard of Sonics. Before going to this location in Pheonix, I thought it was some sort of urban legend.

Sonics is such a tease. It has a bajillion commercials on tv about it's smoothies and slushies, but the the closest one to my house is a good 30-45min drive in the boonies. When the bf told me there were Sonics a-plenty in Phoenix, I HAD to go.

AND I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED! Despite all the hype from the commercials, I was not disappointed at all. I loved the berry-lemon slushies I got. The menu claimed that it would have real fruit in it, and yes, right there at the bottom of my large cup were a couple of real lemon halves. =] I can die happy.

The novelty of ordering through a weird parked car drive through thing was pretty neat too. I'm a fan! Now if only there was a Sonic closer to home..."}
{"text":"I really do love this place but today is not your day guys. You need to step it up. I'm giving a 2 star because regardless of them remembering I'm here to place and order. They had skipped me literally over 4 times in the past 20 minutes. I was about to leave before Nicole finally answered the intercom. Seriously you need to step your service and keep track on what's going on. I literally pushed the button several times before I got a dang reply!"}
{"text":"Between 30min wait times and actually not having large cups, banana, or Reeses, this place was a serious disappointment."}
{"text":"I apologize for the previous comment made long ago. I must have had a bad day. However, this is a wonderful staff."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I definitely would. I had gone last night for my in laws and myself and the service and communication was complete shit. While ordering, my inlaws wanted sundaes with the cone on the side and nuts as well, they had told me It was going to be extra .70 charge, which wasn't a problem. I ordered a blended root beer float and got my boyfriend a strawberry, watermelon slush. I get to the window and they tell us there isn't enough ice cream for the sundaes. I cooperated and said that was fine. Minutes later, they all of a sudden had enough for one of the sundaes. Then they left again and then magically could make the other sundae. That's fine. But when they gave me my order, they had waffle pieces all in the first sundae and no waffle on the side for my second. The manager said that I wasn't specific enough and the cone on the side was $2.70. The pieces was .70. Now, I've worked at a sonic and know that is complete bullshit. To top It off, my float wasn't blended and the slush was complete water. The manager on duty was just plain rude and disrespectful. And on my receipt, they had charged me for the cone. I will be giving corporate a call."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location since I started my job in the area in December. In the morning this location offers large drinks for a dollar. I get the same thing every time I go there; mango iced tea. I noticed the first time I went that it came to $1.29. I did not have time to dispute it as I had to go to work. I went multiple times after that and the cost was $1.07. The server/manager a tall guy w/blind hair (I never remember to get his name) is always pleasant. However this morning I went and they charged me $1.29. I brought this to the attention of the server (whom's name I can't recall) an older shorter lady w/ long black hair. She was very nice and went inside to double check with the manager who's name is Anna. She came back out and said the manager was charging me for the mango flavor. The manager did not even have the customer service skills to come out and soak to me herself. I paid the amount however was not pleased with the manager. I may well try this location again and if they charge incorrectly again I will not return, and make a report to their corporate office since this specific manager is clearly not customer oriented."}
{"text":"So bummed right now ordered a steak and egg burritos didn't check my order until it was too late for me to go back and I ended up with a bacon burrito and I can't stand bacon (I know who doesn't like bacon) so now I'm hungry and grumpy :( I'm giving it the extra star because the strawberry lemonade slushy I got was really good!"}
{"text":"This Sonic not only had hot, tasty fast food.. but is an old fashion fun experience. 

The desserts and drinks are my favorite! A coke with coconut flavoring in it - yes please! And I love the Strawberry limeade.

They even have Happy Hour specials - what other fast food restaurant does that?"}
{"text":"Probably the slowest Sonic I've ever been to. The girl taking our order asked us to repeat what I was saying about 6 times and still couldn't get it right. Then laughed because she knew was she was being an idiot. I ended up just driving away because I was so frustrated."}
{"text":"Its ok, but I got sick from the corn dog. The cherry limeaide is alwayse a winner though."}
{"text":"If i could gave ZERO STARS i would! Freggin nastiest place i ever saw! Walked in an right back out. Stopped to eat and use restroom...omg NO! No tank lids on toliet nothing...just NASTY. Walked through dining area to get to bathroom. Stepped over trash an food in floor...just gross..omg! Went up 2 more exits to eat...yea no thanks...health dept needs to shut this joint down."}
{"text":"I refuse to be mocked. Too bad because the car hops liked my routine over tipping. Won't be coming here anymore. I hope you had good fun on the intercom. Learn to be respectful you punks."}
{"text":"I went to the sonic on Decatur and Craig at 9:45pm and I recently left at 10:10pm and my experience was horrible. I have had better experiences at DMV or the post office. Yes they do have the half priced shakes which is good but you might as well pay full price. I got a large popcorn chicken for $5.29 and it's the size of a medium fry I also got a 4 piece mozzarella stick. Now if your selling mozzarella sticks you should know the customer would like marinara with them so it should come to mind with simple common sense to notify the customer that you are out of marinara sauce when you are ordering not give the customer their food for them to look and see there isn't any marinara so now have to go back into the drive through line just to ask for marinara for them to say they don't have any. I will never go to this location again I'd rather drive to the location by the cannery. So the reasons this location is getting a 1 star is because of the pricing and quantity of the popcorn chicken and the lack of knowledge, work ethic, and common sense of their staff."}
{"text":"CAME ONE DAY AFTER WORK ORDER BURGER AND ONION RINGS CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS !!!! i asked for ranch with my food and they couldnt do that and even had a manager bag my order & she has a worker bring it to me and she has nasty ass attitude and goes my manager bag it and she put a ranch in the bag as she hands me my ranch and walks away fast i go no she didnt or i wouldnt have asked!! FUNNY because i work in customer service as well but she DANA needs to get a new fucking job so hard just to bring me a ranch and stfu its what you get paid to do deal w/it!!! POOR MANAGMENT AS WELL 12:55PM 10/04/17 NEED NEW BETTER WORKERS N MANAGMENT FYI I USE TO WORK AT SONIC WITH JAUN ON GAUDLUPE NOW THATS A MANAGER WITH GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE"}
{"text":"This Sonic's location is right by my sisters house, so we come here every chance we get.  The people are super nice.  The burgers are okay and I only say that because my bun was really soggy.  The main stars here are the slushies.  Can't wait to go back and try other desserts.  Wish they had a larger value menu"}
{"text":"We pulled in and the girl taking the order after pushing the drive in button really seemed to hate her job. 

As did the server that brought us our food. 

As did the worker who just go off and was complaining and yelling to her friends in the parking lot about how much her job sucked.


That being said, the burgers are always good for a mainstream fast food joint. And happy hour makes me happy. It's just not pleasant to be around people that clearly hate their time there."}
{"text":"This is probably the slowest and most unfriendly sonic I've ever been to. 

You always have to announce yourself in the drive thru. If there is a car in front of you, you will still have to announce yourself still. 

Their attitude is often cold and as if you are inconveniencing them."}
{"text":"Yesterday I ordered and medium chocolate cream pie shake when I ate the top of it it was OK but when I started to eat the bottom it tastes like sour cream and sour milk it was so disgusting now I have diarrhea"}
{"text":"Messed up our order twice-- clearly a kitchen or bagging issue. The person who took our order repeated it back perfectly and the receipt reflected our order correctly as well. We received a chicken sandwich instead of a double bacon burger, not even remotely close.  Very frustrating."}
{"text":"Luv Sonic, great service, great food!!!!!! however this location only gets three stars... we were surprised to see a sonic located inside Walmart.... the service is not welcoming, the staff looks as if they don't want to be there... when handling cash no one washes their hands before handling your food or drinks (I guess they just ignored their food handlers classes)....."}
{"text":"The people that work there dont care about their job at all. I'm Pregnant so at 8 pm when happy hour comes my boyfriend and I like to go get a shake and malt. Every time I go through the drive through I always ask politely to put extra malt in. But it seems the one guy shaun is the only one who seems to understand when I ask for extra malt I mean extra malt. I am now to my point of not even coming to sonic to get anything since the employees dont Care. The other thing that makes me crazy is when we get the receipt they put on it that they charged me for the exrtra malt but we still dont get extra malt. Customer service is semi okay some of the girls need to stop being braty and except the fact that they work at sonic."}
{"text":"The good news is the music is blasting loud so you can't hear the person taking your order and it takes 10 minutes to do the order because of the super loud music blasting in your ear while you're trying to order. 
It would have been nice if he could have turned it down after I told him I couldn't hear anything."}
{"text":"It's good for fast food.   The fries can be soggy and soft,  i usually go with the tater tots.  They are quick.  The limeades are always refreshing."}
{"text":"I ordered a bacon slinger 
Not only was there mayo all over the inside of the wrapping

My patty was burnt
And there was a weird liquid that spilled out when I opened my burger 

Really nasty 
Crazy disappointed"}
{"text":"Though I have not eaten at a Sonic in awhile, their beverages drive me crazy!  I recent found out that you can get a delicious drink from half off during their happy hours from 2-5pm.

This particular Sonic is located off Lake Mead Pkwy just a hop, skip and a jump from the entrance to Lake Mead National Recreation Area.

When in need of a high calorie, high sugar liquid cup of goodness ( I love the Ocean Water) after a hard day of playing or exploring the lake area, give this location a go. 

They have a drive-thru so you can get it to go and bounce."}
{"text":"Love the food at sonic. Would probably pick up something once a week. Problem is I don't have twenty minutes to wait in line for a simple item. Not occasionally but consistently. Haven't been there in a year"}
{"text":"An employee (Zoe) brought me the wrong drink. I politely sent it back and asked for the correct one. She brought it back with a whole bunch of \"other\" stuff in it. Ew. She blatantly made the second \"mistake\" and when I confronted her about it, she said she thought I asked for the same one again with a smirk on her face. Bottom line, If a business has poor customer service they will lose customers. I most definitely will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I can see why this location only has 2.5 stars!! On our way to the drive-in tonight we decided to stop and get a bite to eat here since it is on our way! Omg wrong, wrong,wrong!!! The girl that took our order was incredibly rude and acted as if we were bothering her. Then as we pull forward there were two other cars in front if us, we sat and sat and sat for almost 15 mins before they brought out the car in front of us food. So we pulled forward and sat there for another 10 mins before watching them hand our food to the other car in front of us. The car realized, after digging through OUR food, that it wasn't theirs and handed it back to the food server. We pulled out of the drive thru line and left! First off I don't know how long our food was sitting there before they handed it over to complete strangers and second, I do not want food that stranger touched!!! I will never go back to this location again!!"}
{"text":"Nothing beats Sonic after a night of clubbing and drinking at the Palms or any place nearby. Just be warned; I found their tater tots to be saltier than other Sonics I've been to."}
{"text":"I love Sonic but this location sucks. The big flashing sign in front advertised half price shakes after 8. Drove in and parked in front of a sign with an ad for half price shakes after 8. Ordered shakes and paid full price. Asked why and the waitress told us that the sale ended the day before and the manager hadn't got around to changing out the signs. The big neon sign by the name of the restaurant and the sign that takes up 1/3 of the restaurant wall. I don't mind paying full price but if you're advertising the ad should be honored.

Got home, the shakes were 3/4 full, barely mixed and my order of 6 poppers had 4. I wrote a complaint to the restaurant website and received a call from someone that worked at the location. I asked if she was the manager and she told me she just worked there. She asked me if three free shakes worked for my trouble to which I replied, yes. of course. I didn't expect anything for free but that's great. 3 weeks later, no coupons in the mail as promised. I

Of course I'll go back to Sonic. Love the food but never that location."}
{"text":"Drive through wasn't busy, but it took fairly long to get our hotdogs, tots, and fries.  The food was very good.  Thier hotdogs are better than most, and the bill reflects that.  The pricing is alright for infrequent visits.  All things concidered, I'd elect to go elsewhere most of the time."}
{"text":"I always go to this Sonic for a Route 44 Cherry Limeade. The wait may be longer than McDonald's, but the food is fresh and better overall. I will gladly wait a few minutes for better food!

Today my Jeep died at the window and would not start. The employees were VERY HELPFUL! They helped me push it out of the way and two different employees commiserated with me and said that if I needed anything to just ask and that they knew what I was going through was a pain. I finally got it started and drove home with my Route 44 Cherry Limeade! Bottom line, the employees are nice, care, and are clearly doing the best job they can. I greatly appreciate their service and the food.

Thank You!"}
{"text":"Everything about today's visit was great except my food, omg! Ok, the chocolate malt was good, but I went there craving a sonic corn dog. When I got home the breakfast burrito had BBQ sauce in it, fowl, trashes that! The corn dogs sadly were cooked way too much that they shrunk and in the same fryer I think as fish, none of the chewable food was even edible. Paid 16 bucks to have a malt, the garbage got the rest. Thanks Sonic!"}
{"text":"The guy with glasses need to be taken off of orders.  After I stopped him again to ask for ketchup and mustard. He was a smart ass and completely disregarded the fact that I just paid for food.  When I asked for a lot his reply was \" I believe I asked you if you needed anything else.  And was annoyed that he had to give me what I asked for. Management seriously needs to adjust his attitude or put him as a cook so he doesn't have to deal with people."}
{"text":"Girls are nice ..food is always hot and fresh ...love there slushed drinks and corn dogs ..eat there for lunch all the time .."}
{"text":"I was thirsty tonight and made a u-turn to turn to Sonic and surprisingly received a free drink. Thank you! :)"}
{"text":"They serve you quite fast. It is a decent place to eat, don't go there if you are wanting any chocolate ice cream or shake. They don't carry chocolate ice cream."}
{"text":"First off, isn't this Sonic on the NW corner of Elliot and Kyrene not Elliot and Rural?

If you order drive-in style then your server will roller skate your order out to you.  Yes, even if your server is a guy.  

I'm not really that psyched on Sonic.  They have good onion rings if you like onion rings and their Route 44 Cherry Limeades have yet to disappoint me.  Safe bets.

The other night my kids were asking for ice cream and I couldn't see taking them to McDonald's for a $1 dollar sundae when Sonic was just down the road.  So I took them to Sonic for a milkshake.  Two had caramel and my little guy had chocolate.  

Having tasted my daughter's caramel shake before, I knew it was good.  It's subtle and not overwhelmingly 'caramel'.  I think it's probably the best flavor they have.  Chocolate,..eh.  

After getting the drinks we drove around on the interstates and my baby girl (6mos) crashed out as did my son who ordered the chocolate shake.  Mission accomplished.  

Okay Sonic, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Consistently the longest wait of any Sonic I have been to in Vegas. The employees never seem to care at all when people are waiting 20+ minutes for an order. The last time we went I had to go up to the building and threaten to simply leave if we didn't get our food, as we had been waiting for an insane amount of time for a \"fast food' establishment. I will drive the extra miles to a different sonic from now on."}
{"text":"I rarely comment on fast food restaurants online, but am doing so in hopes that someone at corporate or the franchise owner reads these reviews. I have been to this Sonic location about 1/2 dozen times since it opened, and I would describe my visits in a range from \"substandard\" to \"baffling ordeal.\" Whomever is training their mostly-high-school-age waitstaff apparently never received any training themselves. On a recent visit, the entire drive-thru crew was more interested in visiting with their friends in the car ahead of me (who appeared not to have purchased anything) than doing their jobs. During a past visit, I stood for 7-10 minutes inside the restaurant, at the order counter, but was never greeted by anyone. When inside, there is a semi-transparent door through which you can see the outlines of the workers in the food prep area. I did not see anyone in the kitchen on that visit, so I left. I wish I could say that there are alternative, better fast food options in this area, but there aren't. So walk a few steps to the grocery store and make yourself a salad. It's healthier, and you'll have no one but yourself to blame if your order gets screwed up."}
{"text":"I won't. EVER. EAT HERE. My sister and I both got #11s (chicken fingers with fries) and we start eating.. everything was fine. She ate a fry then gave me a disgusted look she spit out her fry and smelt it. Then she asked me to smell it to see if it wasn't just her.. the fry smelt like pee and she said how it smelt was how it tasted. Check the potatoes if they are bad or change the oil... SOMETHING. (The fry smelt like a downtown parking garage (piss) ) ASK ME IF I WAS HUNGRY AFTER.. no"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving 5 stars is because of ANGIE... she is amazing. I come through the drive through every single morning and order the same drink. She makes it fast and convenient. If its busy she will walk outside to bring people their drinks and she has never overcharged me or messed up my order. PLEASE give her a raise!!! However, I will say I will not come here for happy hour any longer. Although drinks are half price they want to charge you an arm and a leg for \"extras\". Since when is cherry flavor an up charge? and since when is adding real cherries to your drink an up charge and you have to ask for it? If I order a cherry soda it needs to have at least one real cherry in it. I shouldn't have to ask. When I asked about the up charge for these items on happy hour the manager states \"there has always been a charge for this, but they aren't supposed to charge it in the morning\" REALLY??? Either you charge or you don't... not whenever you feel like it. Then after I provided multiple receipts showing the same exact items purchased days before at happy hour with no up charges the manager states \"well if its that big of a deal to you ill take it off\"... ARE YOU SERIOUS??? If its that BIG of a deal? WOW... then I saw the survey on my receipt inside the window. However when I got my drinks a reprinted receipt with no survey was attached. I had to go back and request the survey receipt. When I asked the manager if he specifically didn't give me my survey because of this situation he didn't answer. Just walked inside and got me the correct receipt. 

Once again... ANGIE is the only reason I continue to come here every single morning."}
{"text":"1/2 price drinks during happy hour from 2-5pm and half price shakes after 8pm? I'm in!

Had the banana cream pie shake and Jason had the strawberry cheesecake shake. It was the best decision we made that day.

Take your beloved for a late night treat here!"}
{"text":"Sonic, eating with you is a crapshoot. You either are oddly surprised at how good your food is or you are smacked in the face with the blatant fact that you are eating some of the most processed food you'll ever have.

You are generally quick, and sitting in your car... well, I just love it when my car will smell like a chili dog.

But your drinks. Gosh, you come up with some masterpieces. Nerds in my drink? Who would have thought!? DELICIOUS GLORY!"}
{"text":"It's a good idea that most fast food restaurants are utilizing dual drive-thru lanes. However, when a customer asks for just a minute to review the menu, it does not mean take the next 4 vehicles in the other lane, before coming back to the waiting customer. The car behind me even reversed and went to the other line and was assisted before we were. When I stated I was ready (3 cars in) the person stated they would be with me shortly....I would suggest better training of the dual lanes so this doesn't happen to future customers."}
{"text":"Yep, I am going to just freely give away a five star rating to a chain (a fast food chain nonetheless) and further diminish the credibility of my reviews (as if).

This Sonic is our go to place when we want a quick and easy dinner or breakfast. It has been somewhat of our tradition having their breakfast burrito, cheese tots, and a java chiller on a lazy Sunday morning. There are evenings when we just pick up a mash up of different offerings for dinner: cheese tots, 5 pc chicken tender, mozza sticks, and a grilled chicken sandwich to share. The prices are reasonable, the food quality above par in the fast food (possibly other Sonics) realm, and the staff is always extremely polite. Our order has never been screwed up, and that is very important to us because my husband has a strong aversion to certain ingredients.

What started as a convenience grew into a weekend tradition for us."}
{"text":"The service here is pretty good and quick. The reason for a few stars is multiple times we've come here for shakes and they are out of ice cream!!! I was surprised and I can see this happening once in a while but 3 times in the past month?? That's pretty ridiculous I think."}
{"text":"SLOW....expect a long wait. It took 20 minutes to get two milkshakes. Two of the cars ahead of me just left out of frustration. This type of slow service has been commonplace for this location. Plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times now... I don't think they've gotten our order correct even once. It's cheap and the tots are good but we come for the drinks. Tons of options... even if they don't normally get them correct.
Today I've just reached my full of this place. I stopped by to gather drinks for my coworkers. These weren't crazy hard requests. Coke, lemonade, etc. and one UNSWEETENED TEA with sugar free mint. Might have thrown them with the flavor request. Get everything back and I got a sweet tea = loads of sugar. You can test with your blood sugar meter. Not wanting to get anyone ill I will go ahead and pour this out. Not a big deal but this drink was for a severe diabetic this is just crappy. You guys need to get organized and take care the customers. One of the reason I come here is that you have sugar free options. If you don't bother to listen to requests then that defeats the whole purpose of going not to mention is dangerous for people with sugar issues. Diabetics beware."}
{"text":"Very quick and friendly. Great happy hour prices. Try the cherry-limeade. Grill cheese is a little dry."}
{"text":"For real? 17 minutes to get food in a drive thru when I'm the only car?? Teenage knuckleheads work here man. I tried giving this place another shot, but what a let down. 

Last time I was here these kids were coughing serious attitude for not getting a tip. We live in a town of hospitality, if you deliver crappy service you get NOTHING. I seen a worker chick rage out and slam the shit out of a door and knock supplies over all because she didn't receive a tip. Quit being slow as a turtle and walk up to customers with a smile for once. What a disgrace to the Sonic family name. I'm over this place!"}
{"text":"The service was quick and friendly! I love the American Dogs. 1/2 price shakes is an amazing deal that draws you in. Norma/Bethany were friendly and very helpful. Would definitely return to this Sonic location."}
{"text":"I just don't understand why this Sonics drive thru is so slow. I ordered a damn medium fry with a small drink and after waiting 10mins I just had too leave. Normally when I go to the other sonic establishments especially the one in North las vegas on craig rd across from the cannery casino they move the drive thru line very quickly. That's what bothered me the most is I saw that my order was ready even though I was second in line they could have come out taken my card and given my food and I would have been on my way. But after 10 mins of just staring at my order sitting on that counter while i waited for the guy in front of me to get his food I just said screw it an left. Maybe if the manager and employee where paying more attention and not shit chatting maybe they would have done what the other Sonics I have gone to do and given me my simple order."}
{"text":"I've been to this Sonic three times hoping for a better experience each time.  I order the same food, and keep getting the same result, which is not good.  Definitely not the quality that you would expect from a well-managed Sonic (or even one that's average).  Let's compare photos of the food you get vs. the marketed food...

This Sonic is a major disappointment.

***EDIT***

I was just disgusted even more by the fact that my second sandwich tastes like it took a swim in the ocean...  It probably has a 1/2 cup of salt added to the eggs.  I will probably vomit in a few minutes.

***EDIT #2***

I returned with the food and this review, and I spoke to the evening manager.  She was very apologetic, and she did make a customer service recovery effort.  For her efforts, I have upgraded my rating to 2 stars.

I do not know if I'll try this Sonic again, but if I do, it will be for dinner.  I will definitely be staying away from their breakfast menu items."}
{"text":"Loved it!  I made it a point to try this place because the commercials make it look so good!  I wish we had a Sonic in Hawaii (maybe it's good that there isn't)!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a slower fast food restaurant before. Only two cars sitting in the lot and it took me 15 minutes just to get my order (grape slush, family size tater tot and a jr cheeseburger). When my son and I got home our tots were brown and hard, not even fresh. They tasted horrible and I wouldn't doubt they were made in dirty oil. I used to be a fan of sonic in my hometown, but I'm not coming back. If I wanted cheap food and slow service I would have gone to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Not sure why I continue to use the drive through. If there is a long line, it's quicker to pull into a stall and order."}
{"text":"After having a bad experience at another sonic I still decided to try another sonic and am so glad I did. The girl who took me and my fiancées order was very sweet and the carhop was very nice as well. My food was hot and delicious. I'll be back to this location"}
{"text":"If I could give this Sonic 0 stars I would. My fiancée was trying to ask the girl who took our order a question and she rudely interrupted him and said yes. Then she would not let us exchange the onion rings for tots like we do at every sonic. To be honest she was a flat out bitch. I'll never come to this location again."}
{"text":"Normally I LOVE SONIC. This location will never get my business again. I use to come her all the time until last week. I came around 9 after work and nobody else was there.I tried to go through the drive through but no one answered so I thought maybe the times have changed. I went up to the window and saw 2 girls working I waved and thought maybe they had not seen me. One of the girls walked up said we are not open and slammed the window.I called the next day to speak to a manager,what a mistake"}
{"text":"Sonic always has what I'm looking for late at night: Sonic Blasts and Limeades.  I'm not a big fast food fan, but when I'm in the mood for it, Sonic can satisfy.

The service is fine, and the line is never too long."}
{"text":"I actually like this location's coffee. Their burgers are greasy but really good. They always give me cold fries. Their nice and courteous, but they take forever. It takes them 5 minutes just to respond to me after I push the red button and another 20 minutes to actually get my food. It seems like there's only one person working in the morning. Most of their order booths don't even work."}
{"text":"There are a lot less Sonic locations here than in Texas, but yet I never really find myself seeking them out now that we've moved here. I tend to like their commercials, and they have some decent discounts/specials: like right now it's summer shake season, with half off shakes after 8PM.

Went in today and got a peanut butter chocolate flavor for myself, with a chocolate java chiller for my guy. He also took the liberty of adding on a garlic parm hotdog on their new cheese bread dogs, and an order of their little-known \"extreme tots\"- chili cheese tots with ranch and jalapenos.

I'm not a huge fan of the food with this chain and this location didn't stand out from others. Tots are typically too salty for me, ordering them this way lessened the salt flavor. Hotdog, despite the special bun, did not have much flavor either, but the parm sauce on it was pretty interesting.
Shakes were thick and large- prices here seem higher than I'm used to though. PBC shake was better than the java chiller, but I'd like to see a coffee flavor on their shake menu in the future.

I like how the drive-up stands have credit card slots to pay after you order. Wish they could add on a feature to tip this way. I'm always baffled about how much/whether to tip someone to bring me my order, but here the drive-thru section gives you the option to go their instead of to a stand if you know you don't want to tip or don't have cash in addition to your card."}
{"text":"Went here today with a gift card. It wouldn't work in the card reader at the drive up spot, so I asked the server to help. I had just got the card so I knew there was money on it. They ended up having the manager come out, but no one could get it to work. They ended up paying for the whole meal, which I really appreciated because I really only dropped by because I had the card.
Is this a 5 star resteraunt, no, but the service was outstanding and the food was good for being fast food. I really like their shakes (hoping the do 1/2 off shakes again this summer) & happy hour drinks (especially the strawberry limeade)!"}
{"text":"I hate this sonic!! They are slow no matter what time of the day it is or how many cars are in the parking lot. They always mess up my order but I never risk sending it back because you get vides that they would be bitter spitters. I moved away from the valley for 4 years and came back and they are still very bad. The only I stop by is for drinks and if I am the only one here it takes 10 minutes for a cherry limeade."}
{"text":"the only reason I keep going back is because of a young lady named Rachel! She makes you feel like you are a valued customer, unlike other employees there. She is always smiles and my most recent visit was by far the best. FYI sonic now charges 30 cents per Cherry! I wish that was joke!!!!  Smh."}
{"text":"Its simple hire all new management. Horrible customer service. Half of our food was ice cold and almost every order was wrong fries were half full. Fire everyone there and start over!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the slowest and most unorganized service I've ever experienced at a fast food restaurant. Literally sat in a line of three vehicles for 32 minutes waiting to order 2 drinks. Never, ever coming back to this location."}
{"text":"The food here is fair and the service is slow. Plan to spend two to three times as long as you normally would at a Sonic. They tend to get the order correct and the staff is somewhat personable."}
{"text":"The hours of operation are till midnight, it's 11:45 and they have all the car stall lights off and the person working inside just citified to clean and ignored us when we pulled up to the window horrible service"}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time trying to understand why I can't order a side of buffalo sauce at any sonic location. I have to pay for wings that i don't want just to get a side of wing sauce. if I'm willing to spend money on the sauce please explain the issue to me."}
{"text":"Tonight I went thru the drive thru at the Deer Valley & 83rd location. When trying to place my order, the intercom speaker made it next to impossible to give my order. The person on the other end and I were having a very difficult time communicating. She kept saying she could not hear me, and I could not hear her.

When I pulled up to receive my order, I mentioned it to the nice young man delivering my order, that they needed to get the intercom fixed. He then volunteered that a lot of people complain about it, but nothing seems to get done to fix it. I asked for a phone number to where a customer could call, he went back into the store, and came back about 4-5 minutes later, which seemed like an eterity, to explain there was no phone number available to give me, to which I call BS.

I asked for the managers name of the store, he replied \"Brandon\". I mentioned i would be going home to find that number

I went home, tried in vain to find a place online where I could contact Sonic, finally found a customer service number, only to find it was only available during normal business hours. Searched further and found another number, to which I got a call center rep that took my contact info.

This is the 1st time in 2 years  I've been to Sonic, and due to quality of the food at my last visit 2 years ago, have not returned. Boiled hot dogs....not my idea of good food. My wife wanted one of their \"Slushies\" tonight, that was the reason for my visit.

NEVER again. And I will tell 10 friends.

{"text":"Asked for 2 corn dogs. Took 10 minutes to get my 2 corn dogs. I was the 2nd person in line and it wasn't even crowded!! Never again shall I partake of 2 corn dogs from this joint."}
{"text":"How do you mess up a Reese's blast? Well.. Just put ice cream in a cup.. But only half way up the cup.. Spit of whipped cream and dump candy on top...

Oh and wait 7mins at the drive thru for it. When there is only two other customers there... Really? COME ON SONIC!!

If this location wasn't so close to home I wouldn't have dealt with this for so long.. No more from this sonic :("}
{"text":"Worst Sonic I've ever been to. Hoodlums in the drive thru, hoodlums running the kitchen, service was slow and then they asked me to go \"knock on the employees only door\" to get ketchup instead of just giving it to me.

Ridiculous. Will never come here again, and don't advise you to either."}
{"text":"I would give a 5 star rating because the food is always good and the staff friendly, but, twice now we have gone there for breakfast and no response at the drive-up. The lights were on and it was after 6am. Tried to call, no answer.
When the hours say open at 6am, that means ready to serve customers.
Is there a problem getting help to show up early enough or what?
Won't bother for breakfast anymore."}
{"text":"Terrible service my young daughter ordered the wrong thing they would not let her traded out wanted us to buy something else really disappointed"}
{"text":"I am a regular at this Sonic and I really like the employees a lot.  Great treatment and very nice.  Don't know what I would do if I could not stop here on my way to work."}
{"text":"If I could, I'd give one employee 5 stars from this location and it would be to Gloria. Every morning I come, she's always fast, friendly, and makes my drinks just right. I gave this place 3 stars because whenever I come, and Gloria isn't working, whatever employees are working always mess up my order. Either they give me the wrong food or drink, or the quality is bad. I guess I'll only come in the mornings now"}
{"text":"dry burger, over cooked tots, and hard shell corn dogs. If thats your forte, try this place out. I live close, and I still drive straight pass to get something to eat."}
{"text":"The drive through is slow as can be. The kids operating the window are polite but mostly clueless. I typically get the wrong change often in my favor. 
I get a charge of $6.41 give them a five dollar bill and two one dollar bills and a penny, then get $1.60 in change. This has happened twice. I think either their registers do not accept the amount of cash tendered or they are too lazy to enter it, and do not know how to compute change in their heads. It screws them up every time!
It takes something like 6 minutes to get two hot dogs. 
Trying to be friendly, they always give me their name whenever you speak to them, which is a total waste of time. How's about you concentrate on working faster, giving accurate change, and accurate orders instead of telling me your name. I couldn't care less what your name is, and asking me at the window how my day is, when we both know you do not care, is almost an insult and waste of both our times. Forget the meaningless fluff and concentrate on what you're doing instead. 
If your boss insists you ask customers meaningless chat questions, have her-him talk to me."}
{"text":"When you want a great limeade...this is the place to go!

It was happy hour...and who doesnt love a good happy hour?!!?! So I ordered a strawberry limeage and a side of tater tots!

The limeade was great, it had lots of strawberries in it and it was cool and refreshing! I like that they give you a mint on top! 

However, my tots were just warm, so I didn't finish them and if you've every had cold or lukewarm fries you know what I mean when I say...ugh

Overall, I would give them another chance, I mean it was happy hour! Next time I'll try something else off the menu and see if I'm impressed. 

On a positive note, car hop that brought my drink and taters out was super sweet! She was upbeat and friendly and encouraged me to come back! So because of her Sonic...you get an additional star!"}
{"text":"This is the Sonic closest to my home so this is the location I'm at most frequently. 

Personally, I love Sonic. Great selection of sodas and other drinks (definitely try a strawberry limeade!). Full menu is served all day. 

Their burgers are simple but delicious. I've been pleasantly surprised by their breakfast choices.  My favorite thing to order here, by far, is the chicken club toaster. I ask for it with honey mustard instead of mayo and they are always happy to comply!

The fries are so-so, they never seem salty or crunchy enough for my taste. I do like the tater tots, and their onion rings are delish!  I'm also a fan of their mozzarella sticks with marinara.

The drive-thru can get slow, but parking in a stall isn't that big of a deal. Sometimes, at peak times, it's faster to park in a stall than attempt the drive-thru!"}
{"text":"Okay this is bull$hit I go there and order 4 half price milkshakes no problem. I'm watching the screen go by finally says your Order is on its ways I'm waiting patiently and it is already 10 minutes go by finally I press the button and asked what is going on with my order carhop tells me I'm looking at it and I'm bringing it out while I was waiting he brought them out and they where already melting and blaming fellow employee for not bringing them out sooner. I'm also frustrated because of one of the shakes where not correct but I seriously didn't want to wait much longer for the crap the put me threw. My suggestion pull your heads out of your ass and do things correctly"}
{"text":"I always go get ice cream from this location without any issues. I've noticed many signs adverting they are hiring and I guess the new management has made some changes for the worst. I bought two sonic blasts for over $8 today and when I got them was told they don't come with whipped cream and that would be an additional charge. Now their ice cream just looks sad and empty"}
{"text":"Half priced shakes after 8pm? Uh, yes please. Sweet tooth satisfied!"}
{"text":"On Saturday 3-19 my husband and I stop here for an ice tea. The drive thru had a huge line so we pulled in to a stall. A girl brought my tea out after a little wait. Asked if we had a dr pepper he said no she said this is yours. My husband hands her 10.60$ for a 2.58$ drink she had the nerve to ask if we need change and when we said yes she asked how much. Little girl I always tip at the stall but did not today. There is no way you earned an 8.00$ tip.  It is also rude to assume you did.  I think the scarf thing she was wearing may have been on to tight."}
{"text":"Awful, received a horrible looking corn dog and terrible service. The worst part is that this is not the first time I have received bad service at this location but decided to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight.  While the service was good and the employees are very nice we had a couple issues.  Our kids meal hamburger did not have cheese as we asked, they for got a fry, no honey mustard sauces for my Chicken Strips (3 Pieces) and no cherries in any of our cherry limeades.  We did have a big order of 7 people.  We did get our fries but didn't realize the other issues until we got home.  All in all they do have good customer service and our server Rudy was very nice and pleasant."}
{"text":"Happy Hour at Sonic means from 2:00-5:00 pm half price drinks and slushies"}
{"text":"This place absolutely sucks I am convinced that they do not know what a chili cheese dog is everytime i order one I always get some other type of dog no chili no cheese highly disappointed"}
{"text":"Did not even get a simple drive-through order correct. Awful. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Where do I start....so I get a shake and they give me the wrong shake so i call them like hey u gav me the wrong shake there like ok coo bring me a receipt and we will replace it ...ok a I bring receipt and some guy name David who was really mean told me he is not replacing my shake ...it felt extremely racialized because he wrote me off b4 he even saw receipt and after..I wont b returning here or any other Sonic this David guy was the rudest any person at a restaurant has been 2 me and the worst experience ever...I hope they fire that guy he going 2 get them sued"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here every Saturday morning for a drink (occasionally food) and they always provide us with great service and a great attitude! The manager is awesome and is such a hard worker! The food is pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"DO NOT come to this location. I am not sure where the quality food and service went as this used to be a good Sonic location. The last couple of visits have been so disappointing. The food is never prepared correctly. Tonight my burger was cold and the cheese want even melted. The fries were cold and soggy like they have been sitting out for a while. I just threw the whole meal out. Wasn't going to waste the gas to go back and complain. Just won't come back to this location. I hope Management takes notice of these reviews and makes some changes."}
{"text":"The lady in the speaker box on Monday 7/31 at 6:05 pm was super rude. I asked if they could make a blizzard out of chocolate and she started screaming I don't do chocolate ice cream!!! I asked if I could do a chocolate concrete instead and she again shouted I DONT HAVE CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM!!! It was my understanding that ice cream and Custard were two different things, but I'm not an ice cream professional. I thanked her for her time. I know that people don't have high expectations for customer service on boulder highway but I was not rude to her or ever raised my voice and I was only asking about the chocolate options. I highly suggest the people in the speaker box come to realize that if they hate their lives they do not have to take it out in customers who are not being aggressive."}
{"text":"Always a good place to go. Customer service is excellent and beyond. She forgot the rootbeer soda, came back with the soda and never charged us. Service is quick, less than 5 mins. Food is always fresh never disappointed with our order."}
{"text":"We go here often and never a problem. Today we went again and there was a little issue where they charged us for another customers order. After some time, Matt (shift manager) came through and did a stellar job by satisfying the customer in light of their error. I commend Matt on doing the right thing by his customers! As usual, we will be back! :)

Thank you Matt for a job well done!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Not only did we wait over 30 minutes for 2 chicken strip combos and a couple shakes but when we got it the food was completely cold, shakes half melted and everything was wrong. By that time I was so frustrated I didn't even have the energy to complain."}
{"text":"Ok, unless you have never been to a Sonic you know the drill. Pull up, order and eat in your car. Classic American drive in goodness!  Sonic has been one of my favorites since I was a kid back in Louisiana. When I moved to Ohio and the Sonics became few and far between I began to appreciate them a lot more! 
My personal favorite is the footlong chili cheese coney and tots! But sometimes I must admit I have to swap tots for Onion Rings. They have large onion rings that are always battered nicely and not falling apart. I also love their chicken strips with gravy for dipping and their toaster sandwiches. Ok so really there is not much that I do not like ;-)
Their happy hour drink specials are a great treat for any age especially on a hot day! I have to admit a half price slush is a nice treat! And you can have just about any flavor you can imagine... Same with their shakes!"}
{"text":"I have never been so dumbstruck by a staff...But the staff there on 9-24-17 drove me to that point.  We pulled up to the drive thru and were rudely told to HOLD ON I SAID. Sorry we just pulled up and that's all you have said, dude.  He then is over heard yelling to co workers and I quote \"Where my badge? MY BADGE!!! Then there was a lot of noise and commotion and he yelled it again.\"  It was at that point my sister said \"Excuse me\" and he again said \"Hold on I said?\" She told him she was just going to suggest he turn his headset off as he was screaming that to everyone and not to worry we would go elsewhere so he could try and find his badge.  We left and I called the location to talk to the manager and while he muttered something like sorry I am fairly certain her did not care. Mental reminder I will not go to this location again."}
{"text":"You have to love one of the last fast food chains to have drive-in style dining. The experience alone earns a 3-star rating, but combined with their unique drink selection and affordable prices this place deserves a little bump in their rating. For bigger appetites, the \"Footlong Quarter Pound Coney\" is a definite recommendation and their tots are a must order. It's located across from The Palms so you can (depending on your luck) finance your meal after 15 minutes at the slots!"}
{"text":"The customer service was alright but my food was freaking disgusting. I've eaten at many different locations and never have I ever had a Coney that looked like beef jerky. I ordered my meal paid about $25 and change then drove all the way home set to eat. Looked down at my food and saw the ends all chard up. I wanted to throw up right there, so I called them let them know what happened and they said bring it back with receipt and they would take care of it. Sweet, so I thought. Then got there they brought me out another coney, I got all the way home and wouldn't you know the same damn thing happened. I didn't even bother calling again because I wasn't wasting my gas or time with the non sense. Horrible and I will not be going back. If rate this ZERO STARS if it would allow me but obviously I have to put something."}
{"text":"Great for drinks! The service is hit or miss and can sometimes take forever to get your food."}
{"text":"There were 3 teen boys working I was the only customer. One took my order while the guy with frizzy black hair played with his hat, then bite his finger nail ( god knows where the nail went). If that was not gross enough he thought lifting his shirt. ( undies sticking out about 4 inches so cool) and rubbing his  belly was a good thing to do while standing where food Is prepared. This guy should not be working around food. He knew I could see him doing all this what other foul things does he do when people are not watching?"}
{"text":"I actually live in the area. 
And drove 30 minutes just to come to this one and was excited about the food. 
When I was ready to order the person taking my order over the microphone was super rude. I was kinda thrown back by it and let it slide because I like the food but it's still unacceptable for Food Customer Service.
And my order was wrong."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I don't go to sonic often and now it won't be this location. Thanks girl working the drive thru on a Tuesday night you did me a favor"}
{"text":"went with my bae and ordered family tater tots, Oh MY elfin gosh! it taste the best with chik fil-a sauce, so derishious lol"}
{"text":"Amazing food ! Makes me feel like I'm in New York again with the chili cheese dogs and the slushies , and milkshakes . Wow , amazing . I can't put in words how much I love Sonic ."}
{"text":"I have to write this review which I don't rarely write a review for fast food, but you pay for what you get.  

However I stopped by 3-7-16 @ 9:30pm to just pick up a sonic blast for my wife.  They did seem a little busy but what pissed me off was waiting in drive thru to place my order I waiting 10 freaking minutes just to place one simple order.

So I drove up to the drive thru window and I see the staff just hanging out.  The young kid who worked the window was sitting on the floor on his phone.  Once someone saw me drive up that kid sitting in the floor stood up and said \" how can I help you\". I mentioned I was waiting for 10 minutes and if I could speak with the manager.  Well the manager is an 19 yr old kid who is trying his best to make ends meet.  He did a professional job on the fix the issue but I was not going to order in fear my sonic blast would be contaminated.  I've watched movies like that lol.  

But to the district manager, the store manager, and the owner of the store needs to seriously train your staff for customer service.  Not kiss our feet or anything like that BUT to have in mind remember customers are the ones who write your paychecks. 

Waiting 10 minutes is unheard of, unless you were super busy which they were not.  I hope this get to the right person, because I will never stop here again and make sure No one else does either.  That how much influence I have in this area."}
{"text":"You need to double check your order if you ever decide to go to this location. They do not know their own products, server blamed the the person making it saying  they were new. Even though when I questioned what they were giving me, the server initially looked at me like I was crazy. I paid cash and waited 15 minutes for my change, even had to use the red button and remind them, and the server didn't even remember the amount. The master blast I ordered was horrible, almost no brownies or cookie dough on it but at this point I just wash my hands of this place.

Highly not recommended unless you love Sonic, in which case I would advising finding another location."}
{"text":"Went here last night to get their 44oz water and a snack before work. When I ordered I was told my total and to pull forward. I was in the drive thru line for OVER 35 MINUTES!! Finally about 10 minutes at a standstill I asked one of the servers what the problem was; to which he rattled off a few kitchen machined were out of order and there was nothing he could do and quickly told me he would \"just cancel my order\". I replied \"excuse me?\" He sighed and walked off. Finally about 30 minutes after I ordered I asked to speak with the manager, who was polite and the only reason my rating isn't ZERO STARS! I explained I am irritated I have been in line for over a half hour because the machines weren't working and if I ordered something that required that machine why didn't they let me know it might take a while since by this point I am late for work!! Needless to say, horrible management, even worse customer service and I will NOT be returning to this location!!"}
{"text":"Yeah I forget how much this location sucks!!!  Blizzards are lacking so bad.....very disappointed and I need to remember don't go here!!!  Lame customer service too!  BOOO!"}
{"text":"They got my order wrong - big shock, sonics everywhere usually do. I wanted only ketchup and mustard on my burger. She repeated it back saying \"oh I know I got it\" well, no, the burger came wrong. We told her 3 times! The bun was stale tasting and the burger bland. I've always liked their burgers but this one sucked. We really only went due to a gift card. Sonic is best for the slushes, shakes, and ice cream dessert."}
{"text":"I like their new screens where you can see your order to make sure it's all there and correct and swipe your card right there rather than someone running inside/out of your site with it. Happy Hour. Fattening food. What else do chubby want? LOL"}
{"text":"If you're going to come to this Sonic make sure you etch out a lot of time from your day it literally takes half an hour to get anything. I went there once and it was 45 minutes. I thought hmm maybe they're having a bad day. However, I didn't learn my lesson and went back two more times each with them taking forever. I don't know what they're doing in there, but running a business is not one of them."}
{"text":"Hit and miss with this Sonic, goes without saying check your order.  I always have something missing. I honestly like the one on waddell rd better., The food tastes better."}
{"text":"Honestly, I think Sonic's is pretty over-rated. The burgers, chicken tenders, and fries are \"ok\", but what makes this place koo is their drink and dessert menu. and sometimes they have great dollar deals."}
{"text":"I ordered a Master BLAST which is ice cream and they gave me a shake by the time it got to me and I dug in it was partially melted! Annoying! And not ok. I PAID more for a blast not a watery shake!!"}
{"text":"My shit. Usual is a foot long coney with extra onions. Large popcorn chicken with bbq sauce and honey mustard. Rt 44 strawberry anf pineapple slush, extra fruit. YUUUUUM"}
{"text":"This sonic is across the street from me so I come here often... ok a lot. I've noticed they take longer at drive thru than normal. Don't know what's up with that but the staff is always friendly. I will be back :)"}
{"text":"I never get food here, I always just get drinks. Never had a problem with service or waits. Can't comment on food though."}
{"text":"How can you mess up a franchise? This Sonic will show you how!  I live within walking distance and have been there way too many times out of sheer laziness and every time I get what I deserve for stupidly going back.  You have about a 10% chance of the stoned teen on guard (they're rotated out weekly it seems) getting your order right and then you get to spend 10 minutes trying to correct it with them and another 10 with the disgruntled manager dragged over after much head scratching.  Honestly out of the two dozen times I've been there they got my order right once, i actually went home, did a little dance and bought a lottery ticket that night."}
{"text":"The corn dogs are ordered or burnt and recooked nasty nasty nasty. This place is right across the street from MOUNTAIN VISTA Hospital and they should serve a lot better food than that I'll never eat there again gross"}
{"text":"It is really effing annoying to see Sonic ads in Los Angeles when the closest Sonic is in Anaheim.  That's over an hour away, in ideal traffic, for those of you who live somewhere else.  So unless I'm going to La Habra to buy illegal fireworks, I mean ... unless I'm going to Disneyland, I'm nowhere near a Sonic.  So when I'm in Scottsdale I make it a point to stop here.  Last time I was there I got my usual diet cherry limeade and then saw something that changed my world and my arteries.  Fried Mac & Cheese.  Yes, it was little bite-size breaded and fried chunks of Mac & Cheese.  My chest hurts now just thinking about it.  It was heavenly.  If they opened a Sonic here I would have to join a gym."}
{"text":"Not normally a Sonic fan or fast food for that matter, but for some reason when new items come out at fast food joints, I feel compelled to try them. Remember the McDLT? 
The latest is the new Premium Chicken Sandwich (i tried the classic with mayo, lettuce, tomato) and used a 2-1 coupon which you can get by joining the email club. I thought these new sandwiches were pretty good, the chicken breast was thin and well cooked and seasoned and the bun was a giant Ciabatta one that held everything together well. It is pretty healthy, although you might want to get the mayo on the side to help that out because they put alot on there and its shredded lettuce, not leaf style, which is better on a sandwich in my opinion. It's under 5 bucks for one sandwich and is a decent option now if I'm in a pinch and need something tasty and healthy for lunch. 
Their commercials still stink, but food is improving."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this location. Every time I have gone to this location it's always something either they forget to put everything In the bag or its bad customer service. Sent my boyfriend to grab some dinner and of course  they left out something I did call and ask to speak to a manager then they put me on hold and the same person gets back on The phone. I'm done with this location. Great food but bad service"}
{"text":"I eat here regularly but today wss my first time trying breakfast. I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito at 7am it cost 2.89 and when I got to my office at 3920 e Thomas I tried it. It was so excessively over salted that it was inedible, to the point it seemed intentional. No I didn't keep the receipt even though I had wanted to play the transformers game, I just couldn't throw it away fast enough. I work for the post office my time in the the morning is limited and I had hoped to find another option for breakfast but not this"}
{"text":"Juli P. was a delightful service attendant (: 
She always comes to our car with a smile and correct order ... 
Happy Hour at Sonic on a Hot day in the Valley is like a little prayer answered!
 check it out, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"It is half-price shake time after 8 PM until 10 PM at sonic. The months I've had have been very good, I even like the chocolate jalapeño ones. So if you got a sweet tooth and you're out later tonight stop on in only takes a couple minutes.The orders, pretty fast, and you can take your malt and go."}
{"text":"i wasnt impressed with the food taste. the cheeseburger wasnt all that, and the fries were stiff. the only thing i enjoyed was the strawberry shake. that was VERY good."}
{"text":"Love the food and drinks here and the staff is super friendly, but the drive-through wait can be REALLY slow. We've been going here regularly for about 10 months since we moved to the area and about 6 months ago, started noticing the long waits at the drive-through. We went a few weeks ago close to midnight and were told that their computers were acting up, so they were taking orders at the window. There was one car ahead of us at the window. Twenty-five minutes later and we were STILL waiting behind the other car. This is NOT fast food and all we wanted were a couple drinks. We ended up leaving and going somewhere else - haven't returned since. Really disappointing as we like this place for all other reasons."}
{"text":"I got a sonic blast and it was ok. I think Dairy Queen might be better. I waned the blast with the chocolate in the middle but guess I ordered the wrong kind. Next time I will know to ask. Doubt I'll get another one though."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would. 230pm, a handful of cars here, NOT a busy time for them. We order three slushed, and we waited for 30 minutes. 30. Minutes."}
{"text":"Since there is no Sonics around me I really like it here! Their tater tots are awesome, and I'm in love with the watermelon slush. Not a fan of their chicken stuff, but their burgers aren't bad. Yummy and cheap !"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever received at a sonic. Employee taking my order LITERALLY stopped listening to me three times and I had to repeat my order in its entirety at least five times to him...somehow it took them fifteen minutes to complete an order of two burgers (I was on a 30 minute lunch break and there were no other customers) and then on top of that, when the order finally came out, BOTH burgers were made incorrectly. They were the furthest thing from what we had ordered. Asked them to fix them, and they STILL made them wrong. Had to ask a third time for them to correct the order and took a lengthy time to finally complete. I've never ranted about a sonic or any fast food, but the service I received was complete crap."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked to sonic one evening to partake in the reduced price milkshakes after 8pm. I am an ice cream fanatic so I was really excited. We walked up to the menu board and began looking at our options. I was not pleased to see the calorie counts, especially when a mini milkshake had over 700 calories! I ordered a Peanut Butter (700+) and my husband ordered Strawberry (400+) in the mini form. Needless to say he ended up finishing mine. The quality wasn't good and it wasn't worth the calories. For a quick stop after a child's soccer game, this place is ideal. Other than that, I'll take my ice cream business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service.

Before I moved to Vegas, the closest Sonic was 45 minutes away. Surrounded now with multiple locations within minutes of each other, I find myself returning to this location time and time again. 

Service is timely and all interactions with employees there have been friendly. I've never had any issues with my orders. Beverages sometimes come with syrup dripping on the sides...but I can look past that if my order is correct and cooked properly every time. 

Drive thru line appears to be long, but I always just park & order with usual order to food turn around ~5 minutes (even during peak lunch times)."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for buy one get one free milk shake, so I figured why not give Sonic a  try. I have never been to a Sonic before, so I don't know if this similar to all others.  I was extremely disappointed in the food. Apparently you have to buy the largest size milkshake, and then you get a smaller size one for free. The milkshake was OK (I had peanut butter fudge), my friend had Strawberry and thought it was OK.  We ordered onion rings and cheddar poppers....gross is what I can say. I'm not sure if they were fried too long, or they were in old oil - but they had an awful metallic aftertaste. My friend ordered a chili cheeseburger on texas toast, and we came home to find a fried Egg, Bacon, chili, and mayo on Texas Toast.  WHAT WAS THE COOK THINKING? EEW! My friend just had to throw the sandwich away. I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich, the lettuce on it was slimy and the sandwich itself was pretty soggy.  Even with using our coupon, our meals came to over $19!  Can't believe how much their \"fast food\" was. Will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"Jordan took our order and she was rude, plain and simple. The tone in her voice clearly stated she hates her job. Thank goodness she didn't cook our food. Val that brought us our food was awesome."}
{"text":"First time eating here. My kid saw the commercial and wanted the kids meal with sponge bob toy so I decided to give it a try although I'm not a big fan of buying fast food for my son. First it wasn't a sponge bob series toy. Second no mustard for his corn dog like it shows in the menu or not even ketchup. They forgot my tater tots and no stick to stir in my sugar and creamer for my coffee. It took awhile to bring me the creamer and sugar too. Good thing I wasn't in a hurry today. Runner was very nice at least. Just not the best first time experience and besides, eating in the car isn't my thing...uncomfortable!"}
{"text":"Had the Driest Hot Dog ever,.  Cheesie Bacon Pretzel Dog.  What a disappointment, I only get to enjoy a hot dog once in a while, you know trying to eat better and this was not the treat to have.
Yuck hot dog jurkey....how could they even serve a dog this dry???"}
{"text":"Late Night ONLY! The worst shakes. Greasy whip cream that filled up half the cup. I ordered an oreo shake and it was just whip cream and a few crumbs of oreo cookie. Mix that with there nasty whip cream it was disgusting. My mistake for not asking for no whip cream, but it still should not have been half full of it. Just lazy service because it was late."}
{"text":"The most horrible customer service. We just ordered 1 slushee drink and we end up waiting for 40minutes the worst part they gave us the wrong order."}
{"text":"Went to this Sonic today for a drink and quick snack with my two kids. We ordered one soft drink, two slushes, one order of fries and two orders of mozzarella sticks. We waited over 25 minutes for our food and drinks! Totally unacceptable, especially considering they didn't have a lot of customers at the time. When our food finally came out, it wasn't even warm, let alone hot. This is the only sonic anywhere near us, and unfortunately I will have to think twice before going again. Not worth the long wait or poor food quality."}
{"text":"Food came quick and everyone who happy with their food.  Only issue was they forgot the ketchup and had to go back for it."}
{"text":"This sonic was having a special for HALF PRICED grilled cheese. We went through the drive thru and ordered 3 of them thinking about a $1.50. Well we charged almost $5 for three grilled cheese. And when we said something we were told \"we only give out the .50 grilled cheese if you bring it up to us\". Which I think is absolutely stupid and terrible service. So you're gonna promote .50 grilled cheese but won't give it out to anyone unless they tell you to? Dumb"}
{"text":"We always enjoy the drive-in style service here. They have some good happy hour specials on their drinks. The employees are always friendly and the food is.. standard. Typically we stop here for dessert or limeades. If you'er here on Friday nights throughout the summer you're likely to see some interesting cars stop in from the car show across the street.

For fast food, this isn't a bad stop."}
{"text":"Food is mostly A-OK, but this place has and probably always will be about the drinks, slushes, and other treats.  My favorite is still the cherry limeade, but also really love the various real fruit slushes and traditional slushes especially during happy hour pricing. Ice creams, and shakes are also very good here too.  I don't mind the food, I think the foot long coney dog is good, and some of the burgers are good, but the tater tots or fries usually come out served cold..not just warm but downright cold."}
{"text":"The Sonic Blasts here are very inconsistent. Sometimes they have the right amount of mix-ins, but other times there's hardly anything other than plain soft serve. This is what we get here most often, so it's too bad they can't seem to get it right.

The service is fine. The servers are usually nice enough, and the food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved here, the staff has recognized me and been very kind, always asking how things are! Plus, you can't beat happy hour drinks in the heat of AZ! Not a huge complaint, but sometimes the corn dogs taste great and other times not so much (stale/old/not hot)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! they have so many choices of slushies and milkshakes it is hard to choose just 1. If you go during happy hour which is 2-4 they are half price. They have a decent size menu with different options and sides to choose from but the price is right, but you have to try a little of everything so it adds up, but so worth it. They have the best chili cheese tots all gooey and just the right amount of spice. They have a new hot dog called the lil doggie (so cute) which is a small hot dog with cheese chili and jalapenos on it and boy does it have a kick. They have great hamburgers and chicken sandwiches as well! When ever I get to a sonic I have to get all my favorites and more! the service was great very friendly and speedy delivery to your car. Ian did a great job making sure we had everything that we needed."}
{"text":"I was super disappointed to find 3 big tangled onion rings in the mini onion rings I ordered. If you don't have the mini onion rings just tell me instead of giving me what you think will suffice. I am really unhappy with this sonic"}
{"text":"I've had hit-and-miss experiences with this Sonic.  My first experience was sublime ... double cheeseburger and tots - The burger was big, flavorful and juicy and tots were, well, tot-like but that is pretty good. 

My second taste was just meh. This time I got the regular cheeseburger and the missing extra slab of meat made a huge difference.  2 slabs = YUM!  1 slab = Meh.  Want to try their bacon cheeseburger next time.  Bacon makes everything taste better, don't you think?  LOL  I also want to explore more of their beverage selections!  It is about time we had a fast-food joint that served more than sodas and shakes.  A little creativity in the liquids department is refreshing (pun intended).

Very good onions rings too!

All in all, not a bad burger joint, but doesn't even begin to match-up to In-N-Out's marvelous meaty wonders."}
{"text":"Rude. Rude. Rude. To the employees: if you hate your job so much then quit or get a college degree, don't hate on your customers because you choose to work here. But anyway, this place sucks so bad with customer service & food sucks half the time too. Came here at 10:50 (they close at 11), employees are probably ticked because we came right before close, an employee left right around that time & shot us a dirty look while leaving. When we ordered there were 2 separate orders. Myself & my boyfriends friend ordered 2 separate orders & when the girl showed up at the table didn't greet us or anything. Literally said nothing. Didn't announce who's orders were who's, just set our bags down & walked off. The most awkward & uncomfortable situation ever. No one here was nice, I smiled at the girl when we showed up (she was outside spraying off the concrete)... Totally gave me a dirty look & turned away. This place needs new employees because this isn't the first time my food has been cold or drinks watered down. Not coming here again that's for sure. Just go to Cane's that's just down the street, better food & customer service. :)"}
{"text":"Okay, so the people there were super friendly, I have nothing to complain about. But the food & the inside were very disappointing. I came inside.. ALL the tables were absolutely filthy. Not even just some little crumbs, I'm saying filthy. I ordered popcorn chicken, they were all mostly inedible. They were hard like rocks, probably only 3 pieces were ACTUAL pieces of chicken. Waste of my money. This visit was perfectly okay as far as the employees, but one time I came, I went through the drive through... You can see the person inside taking your order... I ordered all of my stuff & there was a pause... I see inside she has me muted & is laughing & talking to another employee. She then says \"I didn't hear you, can you repeat?\"  That was a very frustrating situation especially when I can see you. Oh well. Won't come to this location again."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick burger tonight. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger and tater tots. Got a regular cheeseburger and French fries. Whoever was manning the order taking needs to learn to listen to what the customer wants, not whatever they already have made u. The hamburger and bun were cold. Had to send the fries back and get the tater tots. The only thing he got correct was my drink! Felt sorry for the carhop. He had to make several trips thru no fault of his!!!"}
{"text":"Thought we would give it one last shot since it's conveniently close to the house. Well, no luck. Hate to downgrade to one star, but unfortunately, there's nothing redeeming happening here. 

The waitress came out and served my cone with everything dripping out of it. What a mess. My husbands cup had ice cream all over the outside. She handed it to him and made a comment on how dirty it was but didn't think to wipe it off or even give him a napkin. He asked for one, but of course, she had none. 5 minutes later she comes back with ONE napkin for him to wipe the melted ice cream off of everything.

And, we still didn't have the cup of ice cream for the dog at this point. The waitress told us they ran out of ice cream. They never mentioned anything until after we had already paid, of course. How on earth does an ice cream shop run out of vanilla ice cream? This is after we we're told, while ordering, that they were out of Reese's. She said it would be 5-10 minutes (shocking). So, there we were with two ice cream treats melting for 10 minutes while we waited for the third. I would have asked for them to remake the prior two due to the melting, but that would have been a fiasco. 

Gave it another try and it was an epic fail. NEVER again, Sonic. Time for a complete staff overhaul in this place. Please do yourselves a favor and get someone in there that can run the place somewhere besides into the ground."}
{"text":"This is the absolute slowest sonic that I have ever been to. I don't know if they are just lazy or if they are way under staffed but something needs to be done. Other than that, everyone is nice and food is good."}
{"text":"Pulled in for drinks during happy hour.   Took 15 minutes to bring two drinks ...... then one of them was wrong.    If you come here better not be in a hurry."}
{"text":"It was my first experience at Sonic.  It was very, very disappointing on a car ride back from a Memorial Day picnic.  My Sonic experience was different, first time with a carhop and fast food delivery.  

The carhop was friendly and quick with the order and even gave us extra napkins.  Each of the parking spaces were clean and well maintained.  Not everyone in the car could see the menu though- especially the people in the back seat.  

The food; however, was a different story.  I ordered #1 and a #3: Sonic burger combo with fries and a Coney Footlong with onions and onion rings.  The Sonic burger was luke warm with a dried out McDonald's hamburger patty- nothing good.  The fries were soggy and cold as well.
The Coney Footlong was a cold, overly salted, bland hot dog.  It's taste is similar to a low fat, expired Oscar Mayer wiener dog.  Adding the onions, cheese sauce and chili did not help it at all.  I would prefer a Nathan's hot dog or a Hebrew National Hot Dog plain over another one of the Coney Dogs.  The onion rings weren't bad- they use real Spanish onions in the onion rings.  The rings were somewhat sweet though and need a little salt.  The best part of the meal were the onion rings.  One surprising aspect of the meal was the fact that they have Coke Zero- most other fast food places don't.  

I will not be paying a visit to Sonic again, unless forced there."}
{"text":"I frequent this place, sometimes just to get a couple of bags of ice, or some ice water during the hot time of year.  My wife loves their bagged ice and we keep our freezer stocked with it.  Of course, their lime limeades are to die for, and their food is outstanding."}
{"text":"Man, they need more of these all over the place.  When I lived in San Diego, the closest was about an hour and a half away.  Now that I live in San Jose, the closest is an hour and a half away!  Thank God my parents live in Las Vegas now.  Everytime I go to visit, I try and make a stop over here.  Their menu is like no other fast food joint.  It's kind of like Jack In The Box, but better.  And their drinks, wow, what a selection!  My favorite is this orange drink that tastes exactly like a 50/50 bar.  Now, that's good stuff!"}
{"text":"Wow super slow here ... watched 7 car go through the drive-through while I waited for my two hotdogs.. and then they are barely even warm"}
{"text":"After leaving Rain Nightclub, we (my buddies and I) took all our intoxicated behinds here. 

We initially were going to find a Denny's or something, but upon discovering this great new thing that we've never had, we entered the premises. To bless Sonic with our first ever presence, we took two laps around the parking lot, ghost ride style (for those who don't know what ghost riding means, look it up on urbandictionary.com). 

We all parked and got out the car like we were supposed to eat inside. Unfortunately, the only thing open was the Drive-Thru, so we all got back inside the car and drove up to the window (keep in mind most of us were still intoxicated).

My order consisted of the following:
-Sonic Bacon Cheeseburger (For as fast as they made it, it rivals the Western Bacon Cheeseburger at Carl's Jr which happens to be my favorite)
-Popcorn Chicken Combo with a Strawberry Limeade (they make it much better than the ones they serve at KFC, The bites are larger and not as crunchy so you could actually enjoy the chicken. The fries are pretty standard, but go great with the combo)
-Sonic Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Blast (what a way to finish off a meal)
All this cost me about 10 bucks. Not bad at all.

We parked our car in the parking lot to scarf down our newfound meals. Upon finishing we went back to our hotel room, unable to sleep due to the fact we were all food comatose. When we finally did sleep, we woke up 8 hours after check out. That's a whole 'nother story though. =P

5 stars only for this location, being it was the first time I ever ate at a Sonic. I also wish they open up a location near San Francisco."}
{"text":"Robert, Joey, Jeremiah and Kyler were very helpful and friendly during my visit. I appreciate politeness and respect, especially from young employees.

Food and drinks were pretty good. My only issues are that they charged for $0.10 for each ketchup and that when I asked for tots with cheese they charged me for a chili cheese fry."}
{"text":"Justin was our order taker and car hop. excellent service -quick and 100% of the order was correct ! thank you for great service half price shakes make us happy!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  Usually we really like the boneless wings, but this time they were small, dry, and tasted old.  My mother called to complain, and after spending $34 on this visit, they offer $4 off and a free drink...gee thanks.  This particular Sonic is not going to get my business again.  I took a photo of the nasty small wings and posted those on Yelp as well, take a look."}
{"text":"I ordered food for 1 person. Total cost $15. WTF? At a fast food burger joint it costs FIFTEEN DOLLARS to feed one person? Jeezuz. A small burger, small tater tots, small ice cream and mini mozarella sticks. 

Sounds like a lot, but it was just enough to fill one small person. I think that person shared 3 mozzarella sticks and half the ice cream, that's it. NEVER again will we waste money like that on garbage junk food. It should have been $7"}
{"text":"Why are all the other Yelpers getting down on this Sonic location? It's not so bad.

Service is slower than any Sonic anywhere else in the world. And sometimes it lacks a smile. But it's Sonic. Amazingly yummy slushes, crunchable ice, tasty sundaes, amazing tatertots, and the rest of the menu (as it is at ALL Sonics) is passable. That's just how they roll."}
{"text":"Have not been in a year to a sonic and yeahhhh it's still amazing!! I got the footlong yummy... the staff was great to me, also my kids loved there kids meal and shakes!"}
{"text":"I don't usually waste my time writing reviews for fast food chains because, well, they're fast food chains. But, this Sonic is exceptionally terrible. I have always had a bit of respect for Sonic because I love their slushes, but this location can't even get those right. I've only gone to this location about three times and I will not be returning. The first two times I went they got the wrong flavors for both of the dessert drinks that I ordered. Not even close to what we asked for. Not to mention the drive-through attendant was extremely rude and when I asked him to give me a moment he asked me if I was ready in a rude tone multiple times within about 10 seconds of each other. This time I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. I have sat here for 20 minutes trying to find something that I can compare the texture of the \"meat\" to, but I am stumped. The chicken was nice and thick, but trying to bite through it was extremely difficult as the texture was kind of a crunchy (mind you, it was grilled), rubbery consistency? It was so bad I felt like it was not something my body would even know how to digest, so I threw it out. I'm still shuddering."}
{"text":"Well, something new is out here at Sonic and it tasted good as well. The French Toaster sandwich seems like a great invention of two slices of said toast which is filled with a good egg patty and bacon in my case. It tasted pretty good. I would ask for a pack of syrup next time to dip sandwich, but if this thing stays on the menu, I would order it again for a random meal at any time of the day."}
{"text":"I love their shakes and slushes ! Their boneless wings are also awesome !! But everytime my bf and I come here at this location, they always mess up our order and take forever when no one else is here !"}
{"text":"Sometimes i come here in the odd hours of the night to get some disgusting greasy but totally worth it tots and burgers. 

Usually i grab a number 2 no onion, no mayo, tots and sprite.
Something about the super sonic is just hits the spot for the moment but leaves me in a deep deep sense of regret when i think about the gym...

Sometimes when i stray from my routine and order random items i pretend it's for my pregnant wife...secretly it's for me...

DAMN YOU SONICS!!!"}
{"text":"I stop here for a Happy Hour drink with my son once a week after school. It's always a zoo! The car-hops are friendly and they always make our drinks the way we like.
TODAY, we arrived a few minutes after Happy Hour fully resolved to pay regular price for our drinks. We were the only people there (folks must like Happy Hour). After ordering, the person taking our order asks if we'd like large drinks because he's going to honor the half price.
HOW NICE! We also asked for a cherry for one of our drinks and were greeted with a cute little cup filled with a half dozen cherries!
Let's be clear... this is Sonic, not Ruth's Chris, but kindness is SO hard to find that it's worth a good review!"}
{"text":"Literally the worst Sonic. They told us they stopped serving @10 when they close @12 and then it took 5 min for them to even answer us. They are always super slow. Wouldn't recommend this one."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru. The menu is open to all breakfast to dinner stuff. Lots of specialty drinks with no alcohol :) and deserts.
I got the spicy chicken sandwich on focaccia bread with tatter tots. The tots were great dipped in Ranch dressing. At first I thought the sandwich was to small for the price. But it was delicious and it filled me. My husband got the foot long Coney dog and a breakfast burrito. He says no complaints was flavorful and filling. I can tell you it had a lot of onions on one of them cause just the smell :) We will definitely be back fresh food and great."}
{"text":"Went to sonics for my daughters fund raising for her school and I was quickly reminded how much I dislike this place. I think this may be the worst fast food burger joint for me. 

I'd rather eat crappy burger from McDs."}
{"text":"I recently started visiting Sonic since it is so close to my son's practice field.  I have been going about once and week and the service has been ok in the past but this past Monday 2/26 was absolutely awful.  What is worse is the response from the company.  I ordered an All American dog combo but only wanted ketchup and mustard on the dog, nothing else it came with.  As I drove up I heard the employee say, \"If the guy who ordered the ketchup and mustard hot dog ordered this differently, he could have saved money....just saying.\"  I heard this and decided to not say anything and complain to corporate.  Whether she was correct or not, talking about customers and loud enough to hear you is unacceptable.  I emailed corporate and all they sent me 3 days later was a survey.  No call from the manager.  No apology.  When I first complained, I had clicked the wrong address and that manager emailed me within 1/2 a day.  Unfortunately, that was the wrong location but that manager did the right thing.  I will never return to Sonic due to this experience and lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Very bad service..if you sit in the drive through for 10 min in front of the speaker and no one takes your order while employees look right at you something isn't right.."}
{"text":"Sometimes I just love me some good ole Sonics. The tater tote from heaven and the cherry limenade from sweet baby Jesus him self!!! But this go round I tried something different...umm a big no no and a major fail! I ordered the Green apple slushie with pop rocks at first it was not bad but then I let it sit too long after driving home (about 10 minutes) and a few more minute later (about another 10) I went back to it and it was really sweet and the dissolved candy was just powerdery and gross at the bottom. Even if it was cd and by itself I think it was too sweet. I'll stick to my strawberry limenade and slush! 

My wife's gets her favorite crispy chicken Texas toast sandwich (good choice fix it ain't broke why order something different right?) and I got the the tender dinner combo, not the regular tender combo the \"Dinner\" the difference...2 pcs of toast that weren't that toasty and 1 onion ring. Yes ONE stinking onion ring weird I know. But if they didn't taste good I would have been mad. Thank goodness it did toasty or not and one onion ring, well I guess I need to diet anyway. Good Looking out Sonics no all jokes aside you get one for more money so be warned! Everything else is well it's sonics you know how it is! 

Oh service from the car here is great but the drive thru window is a hot or miss! Yeepee for happy hour half price drinks!!!"}
{"text":"Asked for them to fix the order they made a mistake on and they replied with yes and still gave the wrong order not that hard"}
{"text":"\"Stick to drinks\". They used to have a decent value of food for the dollar. Nope, not anymore. 2nd time I've gone through the drive-thru and ordered a \"Ultimate Meaty Breakfast Burrito w/ Sausage\" and what I actually receive is an \"Ultimately Tiny Pathetic Joke Burrito\". I swear as soon as I got to work to eat my burrito and opened up the bag to pull out the burrito I was disappointed. I was looking around for someone to come up with a camera and say, surprise it's a joke!! I ordered medium tots but I guess those are now small too. What a waste of my time today and money, too many options out there then to spend my money here. One more thing, their drive-thru is almost the slowest I've ever been through anywhere. Bring your taxes next time if you go through the drive-thru."}
{"text":"Worse service ever!!!  Drive thru only - sitting in the car for 48mins and counting .... 7 cars got out of line and took their $ elsewhere. We are waiting cuz we have kids in the car and we're 'next'... - utterly ridiculous."}
{"text":"Waited twenty five minutes for a cheese burger. Worst decision I've ever made. Should avoid at any cost. Was here on a Wednesday night around 1130 pm. Get your people together. It's a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Well had to try the new pretzel on the block and it did not really live up to the $1.99 price tag which would seem hard to do. The pretzel twist itself was hot and fresh, but on the small side and with three bites it was gone. They give you a nice size cup of nacho cheese, but one of the first ingredients was soybean oil, so the dip needs some upgrade. These will be gone soon, but one for .99 cents would be a better value price for this snack item."}
{"text":"Even if you stop here in the middle of the afternoon, the service is slow.  But now it is rediculous.  We stopped here for 2 milk shakes.  After 25 minutes I went up and asked about the order.  They said they were short staffed.  After 45 minutes we left without ever being served.  You have a myriad of choices for spending you fast food $.  Don't waste your time and money at Sonic."}
{"text":"Finally!  I've always been irritated that the Northern CA cable company plays the Sonic ads...and not a Sonic within 60 miles!  

This is how we ended our days here in Phoenix...drive to Sonic, order one of they plethora of shakes, burgers or corn dogs!  HEAVEN!  I love ordering and waiting for someone to bring the food to our car!  Service was always with a smile and we always looked forward to ending our day the SONIC way.

Please open one in SAN JOSE...someone please franchise!!"}
{"text":"I like to think of sonic food as carnival food without the funnel cake. Which you put in your belly when you're making bad decisions, eating late, or drunk. Or on $0.50 corn dog day - because who can resist a deal like that?? The food is subpar, but as your mom always said \"there are starving kids in other countries, so be grateful for what you have.\"  Or just go somewhere else for dinner. Seriously - do that. Go somewhere else for food. Grab your candy slushy and go anywhere else for a cheeseburger, you'll thank me later. 

The drinks, on the other hand, are sugary deliciousness.  If you don't like what you ordered, then you should probably reevaluate your concoction. From flavored sodas, to milkshakes, to candy infused drinks, to plain iced tea, there's something to suit your tastebuds.  If there's a family favorite you can also order certain items by the half gallon (think sweet tea & iced tea & sodas etc). Finally, for those of you living under a rock, they also sell their popular crushed ice by the bag."}
{"text":"I love sonic. This one is just as good as any of them. Fast friendly and priced right. Cheeseburger, tater tots, and the obligatory cherry line aid!  This one doesn't seem to have outdoor seating which is a mild bummer..."}
{"text":"Service I received was fast and very polite! The young guy working there was in great mood which left a good impression for me!"}
{"text":"They didn't have sonic where I grew up, at least, not that I was aware of. 

I first tried sonic when I was a fresh transplant, and I guess I liked it enough, because I kept going back. 

Over the past couple of years, though, as I upgraded my eating habits, I became more and more disappointed in the quality of their food. It's actually to the point that I don't eat here anymore and will only get drinks or shakes because after every meal it seems I have some pretty major stomach issues (I'll spare you all the gory details!). 

This location isn't too bad. It smells pretty bad in the summers, though, as their dumpster isn't too far from the drive through speaker."}
{"text":"Although this is my fourth time here, I've never been satisfied until now. Sonic hot it right with their Chicago dog. It could be a little bigger but overall it's pretty good. Tater tots are always on point!"}
{"text":"Always courteous and give me undivided attention. 
I like this location because it's always nice unlike the one by palms who is crowded, and messy. This one is neat and fast."}
{"text":"I really had to make a yelp account just to tell this. This particular branch has a special spot with my sentiments as I went here alot, but tonight's shift served me uncooked chicken with my Bacon club toaster. I called and I really appreciated the manager taking the time to look up my order and have me make a new one. I guess I could understand that they were busy, but I try to figure out how the staff could've missed this. I'm sure whoever messed up was dealt with and I wish him the best.

No receipt was given either."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Sonic since i was a kid and never had a problem until tonight when they gave me month old expired cheese with my pretzel. That shit is dangerous lol"}
{"text":"Love their Shakes and the Real fruit slush with real strawberries rocks.  They always have deals going on."}
{"text":"I stop at this Sonic every Tuesday, while on the north side of town.  The gentleman Donnie working the drive thru is always pleasant, As is everyone else I've encountered at this location. This is one of the only Sonics in Vegas that actually listens to the customer! My drink is always perfect, this rarely happens at any other location. Thanks to the management staff at this location, your doing a great job training your employees!"}
{"text":"After going out of my way for a Sonic drink, I waited over 15 minutes for a Route44 drink. I counted 10 cars receiving food/drink from the drive thru window. Pushed the button 3 times total (asking about my drink twice). Not to mention, 5 cars total in stalls. Left without a drink. Poor service. You make Sonic Corporation look BAD!"}
{"text":"Here we are again 1/09/2015- this sonic is not selling ice again. Loss of money for the company, loss of money ( in gas ) for me, super annoying! Just have the items available that you offer!"}
{"text":"I typically buy 2 bags of sonic ice each week. Multiple times I've been told @this location they don't have enough ice to sell. So....They suggested making a phone call to see if they have enough to sell. Ridiculous, in my opinion, considering they advertise bags of Sonic Ice on every menu. The reason for my review today, I decided to make the call re: ice inventory and the phone number listed is incorrect! #typical"}
{"text":"Went a few weeks back and it was the first time I'd been since I was 10 years old. So that's going on almost 20 years. I couldn't believe the menu man! It's epic! I got some sort of crazy shake that was also EPIC!! I'm officially a fan of Sonic."}
{"text":"It took 34 minutes from the time we ordered to the time we received 5 small shakes.  And when the girl arrived at the car, she didn't know which shake was which."}
{"text":"The main reason to come to Sonic: Tater Tots.  Man, I love those little potato barrel nuggets.  Simple, salty as hell and delicious.  If you need a tot fix, it's a solid choice.

But. . . tots are just a side (well, to most people).  Sonic also has burgers and hot dogs, but they're mediocre.  But in a town with In n' Out and Five Guys, why would you order a fast food burgers from Sonic? 

So leave the burgers alone.  Eat the tots for a meal."}
{"text":"What they offer are the basics, burgers, hotdogs, tots, drinks or slushes but the execution is so bad I sincerely wonder how this location stays in business. I sincerely believe they could screw up a one car funeral.

Went at lunchtime, generally when places are busy and you'll get hot freshly prepared food but my first clue there might be a problem I was the only car on the north side of the building. I proceeded to place my order and apparently the order taker was the pinball wizard because each time I ordered something what showed up on the confirmation screen was incorrect. One problem was this person could not differentiate between was single burgers (as in one meat patty) and a double burger (historically meaning two meat patties) but he did get the tots order correctly. I wanted to go to Freddys Steak-burgers, but my wife insisted I go to Sonic because she was craving a \"juicy\" Sonic cheeseburger since her experience with Sonic's is better than mine plus she wanted tots. 

The order arrived in a reasonable amount of time and when the carhop read the order ticket attached to the bag, I commented to her the order was only partly correct but I was going to take it anyway. She commented they have been having order problems and apologized for the mistake. She was change challenged but that's for another review of fast food workers deplorable mathematics proficiency.

When I got home we discovered the burgers were extremely DRY as if they had been pre-cooked yesterday and warmed up today when an order was placed. The buns were not fresh however the condiments were correct. As mentioned above all of the double burgers ordered were singles. Perhaps that's an extension of being mathematically challenged.

The potential only saving grace was the tots were very good. 

Unfortunately I failed to check Yelp before going to this location because I would have found their 1.5 star rating. Clue no surprise there. 

Apparently Sonic management just doesn't give a flying rip about providing the basics of hot fresh food because if they did they would have either fixed this location or taken their sign down and called it a day.

Fast food should not be that complicated, but this location proves beyond a shadow of doubt they haven't a clue.

The manager called the next day and apologized saying our experience was unacceptable. She encouraged me to return and allow them to replace our meal. We accepted the offer, the replacement meal was everything we hoped for. In addition to the replacement meal we received Sonic coupons for future visits. This was textbook customer service."}
{"text":"Normally I reserve my review writing for restaurants that serve great food, I'll make an exception this time.

Everyone knows that Sonic isn't the best place to eat, unless you want your arteries to clog and your heart to fail you generally just come every now and then for a shake or to get that tater tot fix.

I happen to drop by here frequently because I'm a big fan of the Rt. 44 Diet Coke. This isn't my favorite Sonic, that's the awesome one on Warm Springs and Eastern, but this is sometimes closer to me. 

So, drop by here one day and sit and sit and sit, just waiting on my oh-so-difficult order of a soft drink. I see one person go through the drive-thru, then another, then another. I finally buzz asking where my drink is. I'm on lunch and I have a job that isn't as easy as delivering a drink to a customer so I've got to get back to it. I wait and see ANOTHER car go through. I buzz again. A few minutes later FINALLY someone comes to give me my drink. Without a straw. Nice. 

So, I give this dump another chance and drop by today. This time I have a coupon for a free drink. I go so often I deserve a free one every now and then. I have some teenager with an attitude problem (working at Sonic, of course you do) confront me and ask for my coupon. I tell him I use this all the time. He demands it again. I tell him to get his manager. His manager, who barely speaks English, comes out and I discuss the problem with him. He PRETENDS like he cares and is going to fix the problem. 

I wait and wait and wait. Nothing. I buzz and ask for my drink (anyone see a pattern?). Says it's coming, nothing. Finally I get my drink FULL of ice, little drink and just want to get out of this trashy place.

This Sonic isn't a corporate store, it's a franchise and they do not give a sh** about you. Go to any other Sonic because they are awesome. This one blows. Ugh."}
{"text":"Omg been in this drive thru line forever. What a joke. Wish I could cut out of line. These 16 yr olds need training cuz this is so ridiculous. I ordered a drink for God's sake. Not even thirsty anymore."}
{"text":"There is NO common sense at this location. Ordered two corn dogs and a large cherry limeade. I thought the total was high (over $7), and when I get to the window I'm told I will get four corn dogs because they have a special buy-one get-one free. I tell the girl I don't want or need four, and I ordered two, and why can't she charge me for one and give me a free one, which is TWO. Dumbass proceeds to argue with me that I didn't order one, I ordered two, so they will give me four. She REFUSES to give me the deal because \"You didn't say you wanted one, you said you wanted two.\" Another woman (equally dumb and not mannered in customer service), comes over and tries to help. I explain what has happened and ask if I can pay for one and get one free. She tells me it's my fault that u am getting four and not two because I didn't say I wanted one corn dog. I asked if the buy one get one was posted anywhere? Crickets chirping. I finally am so pissed I tell them to give me my money back. I don't pay for stupid. Both need to go back to Kindygarden and learn their numbers and basic addition. This was a scam!"}
{"text":"I always go to this location because it is close to my work and I love sonic! But today I got chicken strips and a Dr. pepper...The guy at the drive thru pretty much threw it at me and I had to wait 10 minutes just for my food. When I got to work I grabbed my bag and drink and when i got out of my car the soda exploded drenching me and my bag of food! I had to go into work drenched in soda and didn't even get to eat ANY of my food.."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever, I swear every time I come to this location they always mess up my order and take forever to correct it. I always try to give fast food establishments the benefit of the doubt due to the busy environment however I just placed an order for some popcorn chicken and they gave me fries which took them 20 minutes to bring out the corrected order. Seriously Sonic? Get it together!"}
{"text":"I am literally so DONE with this sonic. Every damn time i come here something goes wrong. I never get the right food... we wait a minimum of 20 minutes drive thru or stall... and ive already had to send in 2 complaints to the GM. now im on yelp finally giving this place the review they deserve since the last time i even got a response back nothing of what they said they would do, was done! Whoever the manager was that emailed me back, couldnt even spell correctly and then asked for my address to send in apology coupons in which i never received. But time after time i give this place chances and never end up satisfied. Tonight was the last straw. I will gladly drive the extra 15 minutes to the one on durango and 215 next time."}
{"text":"Simply rude! Our first attempt to order and my husband asks for a bag of ice, she says they don't have ice, sorry and hangs up. We try again and my husband asks if they have ice for drinks and she says yes and that they do have bags of ice. Happily we order a bag of ice and 2 Route 44 drinks. Then she said okay thank you and hangs up again. Frustrated at the horrible customer service my husband tries again because he wanted to add a corn dogs and we express the bad service and she simply blows us off. Last Sonic location we ever go to again! I'd rather drive a little further!"}
{"text":"Sonic. The perfect example of late night, car dining. During the summer they even offer 1/2 off shakes, floats, icecreams, and slushes after 8pm, how could you resist! Even though all of their food is pretty dissatisfying.. (except maybe their tater tots which are yummy as long as their warm) they have out of this world deals on sweet drinks. Slushies, ice creams, and shakes galore. I reccomend this place if you're looking to satisfy your sweet tooth at 11pm or in search of a 50 cent hotdog"}
{"text":"Of all the Sonics we've been to (and we've been to a lot of them) this location is the quickest. Staff is always friendly. Drinks are always fabulous. And everything comes quickly and with a smile. I judge every other Sonic by this location and it comes out on top every time. Love it!"}
{"text":"Was just here yesterday and there was a car hop (girl in her late teens I think) whose customer service skills were on point for a sonic. Just friendly and knew exactly how to keep a conversation. Forgot her name but you don't run across many car hops like her so she shouldn't be that hard to pin point! Great job!"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick burger before going to the hockey game. Place was clean and the employees were all polite and pleasant to deal with.
The milk shakes were great."}
{"text":"Oh Sonic, you are oh-so-tasty! How is it that happy hour at Sonic is almost as appealing to me as happy hour at a bar? Cranberry limeades just totally rock my socks. And then there's slushies, shakes, flurries, oh my. And I kinda like their hot dogs, cheddar peppers, and popcorn chicken too. So yeah, Sonic is pretty darn great. Their happy hour is a great deal for those of us who like their drinks. Hint: Order it with \"no ice\" or \"easy ice\" to get more drink for your buck. This particular location is nice. Never too busy. Patient and detail-oriented staff. New-ish and clean."}
{"text":"I tried to get food here but there is no sign specifying that it's only drive thru after a certain hour. Great way to advertise 24 hours without specifications. Thanks Sonic."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was decent. Had a receipt for my order that said I owed $8.39 for my meal which was fine. Checked my bank account as I was eating and the charge said I paid $10.07 for the same meal. This location seems to use card readers and cell phones. Buyer beware: use cash or go to jack in the box. I've emailed the corporate office so I hope they can fix the problem."}
{"text":"The only reason for the low rating is because this Sonic consistently has all the mix-ins for their Sonic Blasts AT THE BOTTOM! How is that even a mix-in? Literally all the Oreos or cheesecake or strawberry pieces are crushed into a VERY THICK layer at the bottom of the cup so you can't get anything until you drink the whole thing, then excavate your toppings via a spoon. Also they mess up my orders pretty frequently and the drive-thru is always slow af but it's Sonic, so I'm always assuming the employees are high lol, aka I'm ambivalent to them messing up my orders. I'm mostly just salty about how their shakes are always made so stupidly!!!!!! GAH.

They get an extra star for being open 24/7 though."}
{"text":"This place is usually not bad. But when it comes to their drive thru later in the evening, it's slow as dirt. I have no idea what's going on in the kitchen?! I just ordered a soda and tots, and waited in line for 30 minutes! (Had no choice to wait, was stuck between cars, or I'd cut out of there !).
Note to management: Fix This!"}
{"text":"Ordered and some boneless wings. Had to repeat order 20 times \"really \". Still got order wrong. When  told  order was wrong they didn't care. I guess they were too busy fixing the few orders before us they messed up as well as the 8 after they messed up. What a mess"}
{"text":"I have a serious love of Sonic. Those limeades have had my heart for literally decades. And then there's the popcorn chicken, the hot dogs, the shakes, etc. All in all, it's some pretty decent fast food. And the happy hour prices for drinks are a pretty good deal.

This particular Sonic location appears newer and is somewhat hidden depending on which way you are approaching it. The nice thing is that the drive through always moves quickly and is nice and efficient. Yeah, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Food was hot, but fries tasted like they'd been sitting from yesterday and just reheated - totally gross.  The cheese burger was OK at best...just not up to par with what I'm used to from a good sonic."}
{"text":"It's a Sonic. Not much to report that is different from any other Sonic location. It's the closest location to me. Definitely wish there were more locations around town, especially in SE. I'm a big Sonic fan from years back - long before they were as wide spread as they are now. Big favs of mine are the blasts, limeades, and jalapeno poppers. This location isn't really ever all that busy. The food is delivered rather promptly. The staff are friendly. The orders are correct. Is there really much more to ask for? It's tasty fast food."}
{"text":"Not a fancy place as we all know.
The first time when I visited, it was fantastic! I just needed for a late snack. 
However, second time I visited, as you can see my third picture, it was burned. 
Well, never gonna go again.

Food: for the first visit: Good, but for the second visit: really? 
Price: Good
Service: Good
Parking: Good"}
{"text":"I sat at the drive thru window to place my order for 10 minutes today. No one greeting me, asked me to wait, or pull forward. I was really thirsty so I continued to wait. I even yelled \"Hello???\" A few times. Cars started stacking up behind me. One lady pulled out and drove around to park and order. I left. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Its o.k. Nothing special.  Find the items average.  Would not go out of the way.  For something quick it is o.k.  Drive through takes a little longer.  No inside dinning.  Car hop service or drive through only.  Have not tried car hop so I don't know what that service is like..  See very few cars using the car hop service."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. Never had a good experience but this last one was the final straw. Ordered two super sonic breakfast burritos in the drive thru, drove several miles home to find out neither had sausage. I returned to the store and the manager couldn't even tell me what was supposed to be in them. I asked for a refund in full for the entire order which also included a drink and tots. He offered to make new ones but I was livid. Thankfully he refunded the order, however Sonic is done in my book. You can't even get the basics of fast food right... I don't even want to know what goes on behind the glass."}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:45pm. On a motorcycle. Went to tables in center section to place order of LARGE SWEET TEA and a chili dog. Chili dog was on special for $1.00, but the non refillable LARGE SWEET TEA WAS 2.29. Bill only 3:39 so I paid with a $5.00, and keep the change. When I took a sip of the iced tea, it was bitter. No entry, so I knocked on glass to get attention. Another person came and explained that they don't have sweet tea. I said \" it's on the menu, I'm confused\". Guy said \"we close on 10 minutes and don't have any left\" He offered sugar or sweetener. I complied, but disappointed. 
After putting on sugar, and stirring, that LARGE SWEET TEA must have had less than 8oz of tea. 

I suspect the staff is instructed to fill the cup with ice to encourage refills, and also, be even MORE profitable per drink. 

Overall experience was disappointing."}
{"text":"We love the Happy Hour and the AM discounts on drinks. They have so many different flavors. I love my cherry limeade and strawberry limeade the best. My kids like the mozzie sticks, but I am indifferent to them. Other food I have tried like the Coney dogs and burgers are okay. But I am always ready to get drinks here."}
{"text":"Serving up a variety of drinks in the morning and during Happy Hour. In the Phoenix heat, Choosing from Sonic's huge array of soft drinks, slushes, shakes and specialty drinks is a great way to beat the heat. We bought for drinks for half price during their Happy Hour sale (1/2 off all drinks). I love the strawberry limeade, light ice.

The Slushes were a favorite among my kids.

Thank you, Sonic for helping us that cool!"}
{"text":"Limeades, do I need to say anything else? I oscillate between the classic cherry limeade and strawberry limeade. Whoever was the mixologist who put these combos together is genius. I ordered the strawberry limeade tonight. My daughter had the ocean water. The service was swift and sweet. Thank you, Phenix for taking our order, and Brandon for delivering our beverages, Cheers!"}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping we came here for dinner. We waited for about 25 minutes at the drive-thru for someone to help us and only to be helped by a woman with attitude. After paying we asked for ranch and buffalo only to be told they don't have any ranch or any condiments whatsoever. The woman also had a big attitude when I asked her for a cup of ice."}
{"text":"This is the closest location to me (still a good 10 min drive). If I could rate 0 I would. I have given this sonic multiple chances, and every time is another let down. I won't be returning EVER. I have gone twice and on both occasions they were out of ice cream... And another time I went it sounded like a bunch of high school students throwing a party in the background. I asked for the manager and the girl at the drive thru window let us know she was out back smoking. She went to go get the manager (yelled so loud all surrounding neighbors probably heard her). I will not be returning. Horrible horrible service I don't even know how they are in business."}
{"text":"Will not be returning! The employee who took our order was not only rude but did not know the menu! We asked for a grilled cheese combo and she told us they didn't offer that meal, however directly above every little drive in slot there was a sign advertising for a grilled cheese meal. When we politely told her we were looking at the sign she went silent for a few moments and returned with a bitter attitude. Not only was her tone unpleasant, but she completely overcharged our order. We ended up paying over 15$ on two small meals! Instead of asking someone for help, she just plugged in everything we ordered separately and created a meal herself. By doing this, she individually charged us on each item that would be normally half price in a meal. Oh, and when I got home there was no sauce that I requested either!  I was very unhappy with this service and will not be returning due to their lack of effort."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this location is really REALLY slow. 

I waited almost 10 minutes before I heard a voice ask me what I wanted. I told the receiver to cancel an item as my order was showing incorrectly on the screen. No response. 

I had time to reverse out of the stall, drive around the parking lot, and park in an adjacent stall before I heard the voice ask me what else I wanted! Really Sonic? 

Super disappointed."}
{"text":"I used to work here so I know it gets busy at times. Besides not responding right away in the morning, I've always had good customer service. The mgmt here works hard to give great service to all the customers. The food itself is pretty good. The corn dog reminds me of fair food, the onion rings are fresh, and their all beef hot dogs are pretty darn good. Not to mention their happy hour 2-4!"}
{"text":"Thank you to this Sonic crew and the manager for making my day today! Since moving out of the state of Arizona to Illinois the closest Sonic to our new home is two hours away! Today on my one day on Arizona all I wanted before leaving again was my favorite sonic drink but the system was down and they couldn't take any orders. I know it seems silly to cry over a drink but it was like having a sip of home. When the manager saw how disappointed I was he offered to make me a drink right on the spot regardless of the issues. You have given me more than just a drink today you have made me the happiest girl who just got a little piece of home while I was here! THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"3 out of 4 times I try to come here I end up leaving without buying anything. The drive through is a complete joke. The absolute slowest moving line I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Twice in one week-I came here late at night

I'm a huge fan of the strawberry  slushie - it's my drink of choice and it gives me a great buzz (lol)

Since I have been craving hot dogs- I ordered the all beef dogs( grilled-extra) with my usually, mustard, lite on the chili, and cole slaw- unfortunately they don't offer cole slaw on the west coast(yes cole slaw on hot-dogs are great). 
Sad part I was only able to get one bite because when I got home the hot dog fell on the ground. They need better packaging that actually close. I didn't feel like driving back because my order was special ordered. 

Yeah they gave me cold french fries- which I didn't eat either because I like my food HOT."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend & I have a sweet tooth this is one of our favorite late night 'go to' places. However this location on Lake Mead never fails to take over twenty minutes to get our orders out. The last time we were there it took over 20 minutes for them to run outside to our car to tell us they were out of Oreos to make our shakes... So that was almost 25-30 minutes waiting for our food in the car! I highly recommend driving a few miles and hitting up the location on Cheyenne... Unless you have TIME to blow... Although you do have free entertainment that's for sure."}
{"text":"Feeling slightly bad for writing a review to toss them under the proverbial bus, however I sat and thought about it for two weeks before writing this. 

Really like the half price REAL ice cream shakes. Just wish they had McDonald's straws or Boba straws. 

Got a half price burger out of circumstance since I was there on half price shakes and burger night. It sucked. Two bites and done. 

Also had a grilled cheese, more like cheese between soggy toast... I mean WTF. What happened to butter on a flat top and get that thing crispy and buttery good like mom used to make???

Only had my card, no cash to tip. No option to tip on half ass touch screen. Asked for ketchup, usually they have to go back inside... Stupid beyond me to think that would be in their tool belt apron. To my surprise she reaches down and.... Drumroll..... She hands me two packets, I ask if I can have more.... She says sorry I'm all out and walks off. Ketchup nazi. 

Dude in front of me at a table orders chili dog, fries, drink.... Tips her a buck.... Get handful of ketchup..... Petty yet I think it's a loss for their corporate customer service model and just being a nice person. Well ANGELIQUE with your English accent and bad manners, I hope you are not under the influence of poor leadership that will give you a foundation of misbelief and bad habits. Small thing to bitch about but it's kind of like how a mosquito bite turns into typhoid. 

On a side note.... Wish you could order on your own on the screen, for God's sake it's not rocket science"}
{"text":"Horrible.. Waited in drive through for 45 min to get to the window where an additional 8 min Waite took place.. If a business is known to be this busy it needs to staff accordingly.."}
{"text":"I usually hate drive thru because the service is awful but This Sonic always has friendly staff and attentive."}
{"text":"We stopped at Sonic after a visit to Flight Trampoline Park. I had a chicken sandwich and it was very tender, I was pleasantly surprised. My wife had a Chicago dog and I tried it, the hot dog was small but it was full of flavor. The kids had the chicken tenders and it was very hard and over cooked.

I would like to try again for the hot dogs or chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"I love sonic. This one is just as good as any of them. Fast friendly and priced right. Cheeseburger, tater tots, and the obligatory cherry line aid!  This one doesn't seem to have outdoor seating which is a mild bummer."}
{"text":"OK it may not be this particular Sonic's but it doesn't matter because they're getting a  good review. After Dropping off Hubby at McCarren I came here with my friend and her daughter and I got a yummy burger and tots and a 99cent Banana Split. 

It was delicious. It was fast. I was happy =]"}
{"text":"It is 9:25 pm on Friday, December 23rd, 2011.  Whatever idiot you have working inside taking orders (hispanic woman) needs to get her sht straight.  I ordered a #1 on toast with a cherry strawberry SLUSH.  That does not mean put a bunch of crushed ice in a cup and pour a sour liquid on top of it.  I didn't order a fking limeade!!!  And why ask if we want ketchup, mayo & mustard if THERE'S NO FKING KETCHUP OR MUSTARD to speak of on the damn burger when I get it??!!  Fking idiots.  Monkeys would be a refreshing step up."}
{"text":"Decent for fast food. Chicken sandwiches and slushed are good. Ice cream sundaes are usually small."}
{"text":"I really like the variety of drinks there, but when I ask for a slush or ice cream, their machine always seems to be broken."}
{"text":"Message on the main sign indicated earlier this year that this location was \"closed until summer\".  Recently the sign has changed to just \"closed\" and all the menus on the outside have been removed- no warning or reason of the closure but this is one of several Charlotte area Sonic closures."}
{"text":"not great but pretty good. sometimes the food is prepared a little on the downside but other than that its good. never had a complaint with the customer service."}
{"text":"Loved the All American hot dog with tater tots meal!!! By far one of the best hot dog joints out there! 

My fiancé had the Jalapeño burger with tots and we both loved it!! Way better than McDonalds in Alaska. 

Strawberry Banana smoothie was absolutely delicious as well!

No complaints here for Sonics. :-)"}
{"text":"I came to this Sonic for half price shakes I mean how can you screw up and Shake but evidently this Sonic figured it out they never look like the picture and the flavor is absolutely negligible no matter which flavor you get the staff is unfriendly and not quick
I would like to recommend you go further down Pecos to the Patrick location where the staff is always cheery there's always online but they get through it quickly and their shakes have great flavor and look like the picture
 you're wasting your time at this location in fact they should just close it and make a parking lot and that would be a better use of the space.
I can't imagine paying full price for anything at this location because I'm sure it would be mediocre on a great day."}
{"text":"Rude staff that can't get a simple order correct if I had written it down and handed it to them myself. Cold food and soggy fries and tots no thanks"}
{"text":"This place was trash af, bunch of dirty ghetto kids working and being rude. Place was crowded with bums (no offense to the homeless) sleeping on the benches. Only two machines worked. And then they took all day. I got there 1Pm and left with my food at 11:23 PM . What a bunch of a**holes. Fuck this place. Accidentally gave me cocaine instead of sugar . I was so disgusted . Would considered going back"}
{"text":"Bad customer service, always short staff and workers don't seem to have any type of experience. The food not good."}
{"text":"You guys suck! Ordered 2 shakes,  my husband's was thick and creamy,  mine was so watery !!! I got the Oreo cheesecake one. Thank goodness we went in on the half price shakes after 8pm. You ruined something I was so looking forward too. I want my money back and want to be contacted by your district manager. !!!! Get rid of the stupid high school kids who don't know how to make anything right. Btw what happened to you guys skating out to the cars?? That was the fun of going. Now you just walk out with this i don't give a shit about my job attitude."}
{"text":"Truth be told I only really come here for the drinks. I think their blasts are fantastic and a great treat after any meal. Not just the ice cream but the fact that you can mix and match whatever flavor slush you want with whatever candy with whatever fruit. The possibilities are endless, and I love to try new things each time I go. So far my best one is the strawberry/watermelon nerds slush."}
{"text":"When I was a lad down in Tennessee, we had our first Sonic drive-in installed sometime in the mid-'70s. It was awesome, I remember the sign emblazoned with their slogan at the time, \"Happy Eating,\" and by golly, it sure was happy eating. Mom and dad would often order me a grilled cheese or one of their plain Jane burgers that I still love to this day. Since then, Sonic's menu has changed a number of times, and the quality of the restaurants can vary wildly by location, but I have to give much love to the Wexford location.

As far as my experience has gone there, the food has always been spot on. Some Sonics really wind up slacking in the quality department and the food can often be greasy, but Wexford seems to be running a tight ship at its location. The manager is a super nice guy and was personally busting his butt one morning delivering orders to cars one particular morning when he was short a couple workers.

Anyway, I really love the food here and having it is often a treat as there are no Sonics out near me. That this one is as good as it is is definitely a plus. The onion rings are really good, and not at all greasy. Same goes for the burgers. I just like getting the classic \"Jr. Hamburgers\" with ketchup, mustard, and pickle as they were the ones I'd get as a kid. 

The chili dogs are good, though I would advise getting cheese on them. They put cheese whiz on them here (as they do at every Sonic I've ever been to), and the flavor of it just doesn't work well with the chili, which is otherwise fine on its own. The corn dogs are awesome, however, and cheap to boot.

Of course, it wouldn't be Sonic without slushes. They have a ton of flavors here, including a whole new batch just released, including one with Nerds candy thrown in, though I'm not sure how good that one might be. But Sonic's slushes have always been different from the usual Slurpee/Icee style. They're a bit icier, though not low-rent like Slush Puppies (it seems like you always run out of slush juice real fast on those). Grape will forever be my fave.

The breakfasts are OK. It's probably my least favorite thing here. I'm not huge on breakfast burritos, and the toaster sandwiches are decent. You can order lunch and dinner items if you so choose to, but compared to other fast food breakfasts, Sonic is trailing a little bit behind.

Other than that, everything else here is great, from the chicken strips to the milkshakes. And of course, the beverage happy hour is from 2-4 PM daily, so be sure to stop by then and order a 44 oz drink to pound into your bladder. Good times!"}
{"text":"Had their breakfast burritos twice - gotta say that they are pretty good especially with their hot sauce - I got the sausage burrito combo - orange juice and their amazingly crispy tater tots!

Came here another time when they had half off of their drinks - was pretty disappointed that their slushy machine was broken - so my brother ordered me their Route 66 Cherry Limeade - which wasn't as delicious as their Strawberry Limeade - which had real chunks of strawberries."}
{"text":"Love that they accommodate gluten free requests!!!! It's very hard to find a GF breakfast on the go! Sonic offers breakfast burritos in a bowl and their tator-tots/fries are GF!!! A big thank you to the drive thru lady who made the suggestion, will definitely be back!
And it was delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru with barely any other card and waited, then waited some more and finally left. Defeats the purpose of having a drive thru"}
{"text":"This place is all hype and nothing memorable. Burgers and hot dogs were not A or even B quality. I had to try it since it was late and pretty few restaurants were open at this hour. If you come here just for the tater tots, then maybe I can understand. Wait, NOPE. Go to In n Out before coming here or even Whattaburger which is right across the street. Still better than Sonic. 

Hot dogs = terrible. I'd rather have Nathan's or Weinerschnitzel. Too thin and no flavor. 

Now I can say I've tried it and I'll never be coming back here. I think the only thing they have going for them is the ability to customize your drink flavors if you get a slushie. I can see college students packing this place but why when you can find other fast-food joints at the same price."}
{"text":"Sonic has some interesting stuff on their menu. When I think of Sonic I think of people who have the munchies because in a right state of mind I don't think I would eat half the stuff on their menu. I usually feel overwhelmed by all their drink choices. Don't get me wrong...I've had good food from there but the next day it never really sits well with me =/ I'm sure I will eat Sonic again...and regret it the next morning. It's a love hate relationship but that's usually the case with comfort food."}
{"text":"I have to give sonic props for bringing in hatch green chilies to the menu!! Way to go!!!  To have to love a classic burger joint that gives you the CHILIE!!"}
{"text":"Two words (maybe three??? ) ......CHERRY LIME-AIDE ...... nuff said!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Reeces Concrete and was surprised when paying the girl listed back my order as Reeces Banana Concrete. I corrected her and said no banana just Reeces. When she told the other workers not to add the banana one worker replied \"Tell her its too late and already done\" when I said No and asked them to remake the drink without bananas they shut the drive thru window and talked bad about me. Then they asked me to pull forward and wait for them to redo the drink. 15 minutes later and no drink. Asked to speak to the owner and for a refund. Was only refunded half of my $ because the worker couldn't do math. Owner was not remorseful or embarrassed at his employees behavior. Will tell everyone I know about the horrible service."}
{"text":"It's takes a lifetime and a half to get your food here unless you go through the drive thru. This makes the drive-in aspect seem quite pointless to me if the employees can't get you your food within 5..maybe even 10 minutes, nonetheless 45 minutes like I was there waiting the other day. 

The food is okay but nothing noteworthy. That may be an understatement though."}
{"text":"I am giving this location 1star as a place for employment.  My 16 yo was so excited to start her job with this fast food restaurant.  I was surprised that she wanted to try something in the fast food industry as I own a Company, and she could have worked for me.  The excitement was there.  It's so unfortunate that poor management can really open ones eyes to how some people lack work ethic and integrity. Sad that this was my daughters first experience with fast food.  Let's say that when Jose was there the team lead/asst manager's would be on their best behavior, but as soon as he left it would be a different story.  I will be kind and not list her/their names.  However She has the new employees carhop, make drinks, take orders, clean the bathrooms, and take out the trash all while she sits on her phone.  Learn how to treat new employees.  There is probably a reason for high turnovers at this location, and I am sure it's not because they love their job and how they are treated.  Sad, sad, Sad!  Tips were shortened at the end of the night.  Jose has been notified so hopefully something is done as this is no way to treat people.  The actual rating is 0, however, it did make me choose at least one."}
{"text":"I've been to this Sonics twice now and each time I've been disappointed. I've always loved the slushes and just moved to the Avondale area so this is the closest location for my family.
First time I ordered slushes and meals, the chicken strips I ordered were hard and the meat was so dry as if they were over fried. The slushes were also served more melted than what they're supposed to be and the whip was mixed in as if they were sitting for a while.
The second time we got slushes and some mozzarella cheese sticks and corn dog, the four cheese sticks had no cheese in them when we ate them and the corn dog was hard/dried I didn't even finish it was so disgusted. Again, over fried and the slushes melted down. 
Needless to say we won't be returning to this location and will drive the extra time to another."}
{"text":"This place is awful don't waste your money! Ordered plain hamburgers for the kids we got cheeseburgers with everything on it. Is it really that hard to get a order correct? I don't think so!!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is , food poisoning! Every single time I get a milkshake from here someone I'm with gets sick! Not to mention the fact that every time I go only the drive in portion is open because they are under staffed....will not be going back. They need to check their expiration dates or something."}
{"text":"So as you can tell from all the other reviews, this sonic is utterly terrible! They are the worst fast food customer service in town.  Tonight we waited almost 20minutes for 2 small blasts and 1 small burger.  First, the drive-thru was empty when we parked. by the time our order finally was brought up to our car, several cars had come and gone through.   Since they took forever with no reason, My girlfriend and I asked to talk to the manager, and after waiting a few more minutes he just gave us an excuse that they were training 6 new people.....on a Saturday night????  I don't think this guy even said sorry.   So we're done with this location.  I'd rather go to ANYwhere else.  I'd rather go to the sonic on Gilbert rd (maybe 10miles away).   Avoid this sonic after 8 too, the lines get HUGE.  We showed up at 730, and it was nearly 8 by the time we left.  The parking lot was still pretty empty, and they don't care...."}
{"text":"This location absolutely never gets the order correct, I mean NEVER! They are so bad we stopped going there for over a year...until last night. Our order could not get much simpler; 4 sundaes: 2 Hot Fudge, 1 Strawberry and 1 Caramel. That's it! The young woman read it back the first time as 2 hot fudge with caramel and strawberry. I corrected her and repeated the order. This time it was 1 caramel with hot fudge and 1 strawberry with hot fudge. Then she repeated a few others that were not even close.
By this time, my wife and I are laughing to the point of tears. Are they jerking us around, surely they cannot be that limited on the intellectual scale.
Finally, she gets it right, or so we think. Now she stated that the total was over $25.00 for 4 sundaes. These are $2.19 each or $8.76 before tax. I hit the call button once again and get someone that is clearly related to the first person and does not comprehend the problem. After a few minutes and silence, she said she would cancel the order and reenter it. Round 2: not as bad as round 1, but close! She finally stated that they must have added another order to our bill. 
That's it, never again! If I ever go back there, I might as well put in a job application since on the stupid scale, I would qualify for going back to that location.
One final note, we did get a good laugh out of it."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Food was too oily and I could taste the old oil that they cooked it in. I felt like I was eating a heart attack. It was my first experience eating at Sonic. I don't think I will eat there again."}
{"text":"Always correct and efficient. Also, I think this one tastes better than others. Hah. The employees are pleasant, which is basically a bonus when it comes to fast food.

I'm in a love/hate with the location -- hate it because it's just far enough to be annoying but love it because if it was closer I'd probably eat it way too much.

Their Ocean Water tastes really, really good.  I know - odd, but awesome."}
{"text":"Wow such a great experience. Granted at first I was upset due to not being given napkins and initially I asked for the smallest shake and ended up with a small which was $3 but regardless the manager Jeff saw me looking for napkins immediately helped me and refunded me the difference of a mini versus a small. Little things go a long way :)"}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru EVER!!!! I never wait less than 15mins. In fact, I'm waiting in line now. If you're in a hurry or on a lunch break, do NOT stop here. You will be late returning to work."}
{"text":"I just sat in this drive through behind ONE car for 21 minutes. Im not sure if there was an issue with the order, but if that was the case the customer could've been asked to move to a parking space so the next cars could be served. After waiting 21 minutes and finally getting my daughters order, everything was stone cold. I paid $12.62 for a cold burger, cold fries and 2 drinks. Very disappointing service!"}
{"text":"When does a 4.49 milk shake cost 4.99?  When the cashier says the price has been changed in the computer, but not on the menu. Rip off."}
{"text":"I LOVE SONIC...ok first off I hate fast food. You will rarely find me at McDonalds, Taco Bell, or Carl's Jr. The only time you'd find me at Jack in the Crack is after a night of major partying. Funny how good their tacos taste after you upchuck all those jager and so co shots. I know......ewwwwww grosssss. Anyways my mind's wandering from the point of this all. SONIC I will eat. Helloooo dollar slushies. I could have a limeaid everyday. I usually get the grilled chicken sandwich thingy....i know it's not good for me but it doesn't taste like fast food so it's ok."}
{"text":"What the heck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This means no more Walmart shopping!
Now what!
Thirsty and now have to drive south.


I sure hope they comeback."}
{"text":"Antonio had very good customer service and excellent food quality. We are very satisfied with our order"}
{"text":"I wanna start by saying laughing my butt off !! You guys wanna be paid 12 an hour but you make me wait 8 min for some tots! When you are serving people behind me while I look at the tray of heat lamp tots sitting there. Then you realize that's all I'm waiting for you set the bag behind you and still proceed with getting others people out to them behind me then you guys finally realize my food is sitting behind you!! How was 2 burgers and tots $20 oh wait you all wanted to be paid $12 an hour! I'm disappointed and the food fast like it's been in a heat lamp for 2 hours!"}
{"text":"Like many others, the drinks are good, but I am reviewing the drinks. I drove through to get a few grilled chicken sandwiches for my husband & I. We also substituted onion rings for fries. They were the greasiest onion rings in town!
 All I have to say is that everything was horrible, Horrible, HORRIBLE!!! The chicken was DISGUSTING...100% inedible! It looked nasty, and tasted worse, like a rubber chicken! We get AMAZING grilled chicken sandwiches at Wendy's, and after this, I will never again mess with perfection! Oh, and as everyone else already said, the drive thru is ridiculous! I actually called them & sent my husband back to get our money back. I will have to say that they kindly agreed! ;)"}
{"text":"Good food and drinks.  Wish they had one in my town.  Alawys a good choice once you're tired of eating buffets or paying for expensive meals."}
{"text":"For fast food, pretty good.  service is fast.  drive in style is really unique and convenient."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for fast food. I could understand if your busy but I was the only damn car in the parking lot! So needless to say after 20 minutes we left without food! :("}
{"text":"I frequented this particular location for a good stint of time (it was by a job of mine) and always had overall good service.  The drive-thru line was almost not worth its wait half the time - just pull up and relax in a carport.

Servers are always friendly and food orders came out correct.  Promptness was really a wild card -- I also came here mostly for lunches, so I did expect it to be busier.  Sometimes it was quick service, sometimes I'd be on the edge of pushing that little red button when I saw someone skating out with my food.

I will admit, though, the food always came out hot and always tasted delicious.  No bad experiences in that department.

Route 44 Diet Ocean Water is seriously my lifeblood.  Just have to throw that in there."}
{"text":"I asked Siri where the nearest Sonic was and she told me to go to this one. The funny thing is that I kept thinking Siri must be crazy as I drove past cotton fields, horse farms, and what looked like deserted homes... finally I came upon something called OLD TOWN Buckeye and yes, Siri was right.. there is a Sonic there!  

I am a huge fan of their ice. I know that sounds really weird, but Sonic has crushed ice, which makes any kind of drink so much better.

If you like the old car hop, diner style food, this place has a lot to offer. I would prefer it had a better location, but the service and food were on par with any other location.

I like to park and have them skate the food out, I like that they have the little order speaker at every parking spot, so you can be lazy and not even get out of your car. LOL.

My fave thing to get is a toaster and tots and if i am feeling very evil, a banana split!

They really have some good drinks too.. all sorts of mixtures. I would drop in more often for a slush if it weren't so out of the way."}
{"text":"Fastest shakes in the west. Best service I have ever received at a sonic. And I don't do yelp reviews often but when the people are as fast and nice as this how can you not."}
{"text":"While I'm not the biggest fan of the food; I am the biggest fan of the Cranberry Limeade during happy hour and the hot fudge sundae that you have to request off-the-menu. 
Also - they earned extra points when my niece and I took our rabbit through the drive -thru and the girls gave us a little cup of lettuce as a treat for the bunny. How sweet is that?! Move over dog treats!"}
{"text":"REALLY??? 
Second time I've ordered a burrito with NO MEAT.. to get home and find it filled with bacon! I actually took it back and explained to the nice girl that I'm a vegetarian .. she apologized and had a new one made. All I asked was for the vegetables on it ( jalapeños, onions, tomatoes, egg, and cheese) only to get home yet again.. to find nothing but cheese on it.  I know she didn't make it.. 
seriously how can you literally screw it up again? Thank god none of your employees work in a hospital! I'll never go back to this location! Lazy."}
{"text":"Waited 26-27 minutes in the drive thru line (I was only 3 cars back to start with - and neither of the 2 orders in front of me were big) and...of course received the wrong order (even though it was read back to me 3 times). I walked back to Sonic (2 blocks away from mechanic I was headed to) and then waited another 10 minutes for my chicken sandwich, which came out wrong again. I left and just accepted that it was not going to happen today :-)"}
{"text":"I like this location because they always get my order right and if I park and order they are usually really quick. The drive-through tends to take a little bit longer so I always just park instead. I try to come during their happy hour between 2-4 to get half price drinks. I always order a cherry limeade with easy ice. Most places will throw a ton of ice in even if you ask for easy ice but this place doesn't!"}
{"text":"This place has the longest wait times you will ever experience. Don't even attempt to go through the drive-through because you will spend at least 15 minutes waiting. There are plenty of other places nearby for me to go."}
{"text":"Do not go to this Sonic. Now I know why this Sonic has such poor ratings! We went for a treat last night and after pushing the button to order, were told they would be with us in a minute. A car pulled up beside us, placed their order and we were left waiting. Needless to say, their customer service is horrendous. We took our business to Dairy Queen!"}
{"text":"Longest I have ever waited for a drink. Almost half an hour in the drive thru. And only started with 4 cars in front of me. No escape route if you want to call it quits either."}
{"text":"I ordered Jumbo popcorn chicken and onion rings and I was very disappointed in what I received. Both items were not that good. I couldn't even finish them they were so bad."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst food anyone could possibly order. I had sweaty soggy hot dogs with a side of dry fries soggy oily fries. And oh let me not forget the pound of Mustard and crinkled onion on top of the hot dog"}
{"text":"As a food service employee myself, I know how frustrating customers can be. However I have never encountered a situation where it was necessary to give a customer attitude over something that isn't even their fault. Sandy gave us rude service and was not helpful in the slightest. The other girl at the window apologized and attempted to make the situation better but Sandy's attitude ruined the entire experience. We heard her berating the other employees for faults that can be placed on everyone. There is no excuse for her behavior and ruined this sonic for me."}
{"text":"I should be giving them zero stars but I'm giving them one because their milkshakes are freaking delicious. Other than that, I've been here on multiple occasions to get said milkshake when my boyfriend decides to spontaneously order some food as well. Like I said MULTIPLE occasions like 3-4. Every.single.time we get home and his order is wrong. Like horrifically wrong. Like ordered jalapeño poppers and ended up with a corn dog and tots. The first time I thought hey it happens, but the second time I was like are you kidding me??? And by the third time, I've just learned our lesson. Sonic runs will strictly be for milkshakes and milkshakes alone."}
{"text":"Since some of these reviews are fairly old I decided to give this sonic a try. I was in at out the drive thru in less than 3 minutes with someone what a decent sized order. They girl on the headset and the gentleman Brian that brought out the food were very friendly and courteous"}
{"text":"Lids were not secured. Carhop spilled drinks on my white dress and giggled. We asked for napkins. He never returned. 

-No resolution for my ruined dress.

-No help with cleaning up my brand new car

-No offer to refill the drinks. 

What's the point of being business? You suck, Sonic."}
{"text":"Got grilled cheeses and tater tots and they didn't mess up. He also told me to have a super sonic day so I did."}
{"text":"I frequent this location the most since it is closest to my house. There's always great text deals and usually they're pretty fast.  The shakes are really filling but hey if you're down with that go for it -- after 8pm they're half price!

The other great thing?  Breakfast ALL DAY.  I'm in love with their burritos, and every so often I get the text for all-day 99 cent breakfast burritos.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"I want to give them a good review because I love the drinks, but it's gotten so bad I doubt I'll go back at least not to this location.  It's not worth the frustration.  I doubt anyone is going to yelp sonic before they go, but there's no use in voicing my concerns to the teenagers that run the place because there is a new set every time we go.  We've gone 4 times in the last 6-8 months and EVERY TIME the order was wrong.  And while the order was large (4 meals, slushy drinks and a family appetizer, total over $40) it wasn't complicated at all.  The only special request was no cheese on the bacon burger.  Just no cheese, that's it.  And yet it's wrong every time.  EVERY TIME.  The first two times I didn't check before leaving and I ended up with nothing to eat when i got home because they forgot my meal (which I paid for) the second two times, they again forgot something that we paid for or put cheese on the freaking burger and we had to pull forward and wait for it to be corrected while the rest of the $40 worth of food we bought got cold. I've considered parking and trying to order from there, in hopes that they would get it right but the drive through line goes through the middle of where you park to order and if the line is long there is no way to get out.  I love slushy ice and when the weather hits 110 degrees again, I may be tempted to try sonic again, but as of now I'm not going back.  :("}
{"text":"Great time here. You really can see the servers roller skate well. My order was perfect and in a timely fashion. Thanks Sonic!!!"}
{"text":"Great people and quick food!
My husband and I use this as a fun quick date .. a time to sit together and not be bothered by others"}
{"text":"To be honest this is my first time writing a yelp review and I hate to do this but every single time I have EVER came to this location it has been an absolutely ridiculous wait time... and I've also had to wait for about 5 minutes TO PAY when they told me they're out of what I wanted.. I was here tonight and thought to myself, why do I still come here when literally every time I come it's bad service? I know people probably don't care but I thought I'd just say something in hopes that the owner or co workers would see this and think \"hmm maybe we should do something..\" okay thanks"}
{"text":"Total fail.  Footlong hotdog consist of two dog with two different color! .  Will check next time around.  So sad"}
{"text":"Chicago Dog.  Just go do it.  You'll be glad you did.

Quick, friendly service."}
{"text":"Sonic is a great All American drive-in chain that has a nostalgic feel to it. They have a variety of burgers, shakes, slushes, sundaes all delivered to you by people on roller skates. This location has friendly employees and, like the other locations, offers half price drinks and slushes during Happy Hour (2-5) everyday! 

A couple of favorites - Cherry Limeade, Strawberry Cream Slushy and  peanut butter shakes! :)"}
{"text":"This location is the best sonic one they are open 24 hours on the drive thru and I always like to try a new drink every time and when I ask for suggestions they are always happy to suggest and recommend"}
{"text":"Ordered an ultimate chicken sandwich with no mayo and two breakfast burritos. Received one breakfast burrito, and the classic chicken sandwich with mayo. Boo. Food was warm though; always a good thing."}
{"text":"If you are expecting to get correct change back don't count on it. Every time I go I have to remind them that they shorted me. It almost feels as though they don't have registers that count money for them and tell them how much money to take out."}
{"text":"I ordered one of the vanilla birthday cake waffle cones. I received a sad little ice cream turd in a large waffle cone and attitude from the car hop. Do not waste your time."}
{"text":"The WORST Sonic I've ever been to. Unfortunately it's the closest to me, but they have gotten my order wrong EVERY SINGLE TIME. Save yourself the trouble and go to a different one."}
{"text":"Unbelievably SLOW.  I'm fairly certain we spent close to 30 mins in the drive thru with only three cars ahead of us.  We ordered 2 slush's and an order of onion rings.   Plus I felt so uncomfortable after using my debit card there that I immediately called my bank to have the card deactivated, and a new card issued.  I have never been to a drive through where they closed the window to run your card.  Plus I looked at the receipt and the card was KEYED in, which is according to my bank highly suspicious for fraud.  Lesson learned pay cash when ordering food.  Not happy with my visit and will never return."}
{"text":"Do we have a complete lack of intelligence here? It's not rocket science.

I was totally unimpressed with this location, but I did end up with a GREAT funny story to re-tell over and over. Math is not the strength of our future youth that work here, tried to explain twice and still got no where.

I hope you have better luck... and maybe better review of this dive"}
{"text":"Food was hot and they were busy but I still should not have spent 30minutes in the drivethru. I was also mad about seeing what my chicken looked like. I have had McDonald's nuggets bigger than what I got and it was all of the peices too. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"This was a promotional night for 79 cent slushes and half price shakes.  Well the line was out in the street and all the spaces were full.  They needed more car hops and faster service in the drive thru.  But I like that they have so many slush flavors to chose from 25 to be exact.  And the same amount of shake choices.  Which is why it along with price was such a popular event. 

 I had the pineapple with fresh fruit and my daughter had the chocolate with bacon shake yep that's what I said.  To me that something that doesn't need to be a shake but they got it there.  She says it was good and she will get it all the time.  I liked the slush and will be getting it again.

Since they have this promo weekly during the summer it pays to get there early!!!and just wait it out.  The half price shakes start at 8pm. The slush is a text special.   If you haven't already subscribed  the Sonic Drive In text message now is the time to do so.

Every week they will feature different specials."}
{"text":"The person taking my order didn't listen and Sonic needs to put better advertisement so you know all there specials."}
{"text":"My first visit to a Sonic, and it was ok.  Service was really, really slow - we noticed several cars that came in after us got served before us.  I had the kids meal with grilled cheese & tater tots.  The grilled cheese was with Texas Toast and pretty tasty.  The tots rocked. ;)  My friend's cheeseburger was fine, too.  The slow service is what's knocking down the stars - we didn't even get any ketchup for the tots, yet as I was finishing the last one, someone wheeled by and asked us if we needed any condiments.  Fooey."}
{"text":"Worst sonic ever! I can not believe the service I just had! I pull up in the drive thru and there were two cars in front of me. I waited 15 min before I got to the speaker. She said hang on... I waited another 5mins just sitting there I said hello like 5 times so I just finally pulled up to the window and she said sorry what I can I get you. I ordered two slushes and both were just sugar water not even a slush consistently. I was livid! I will never come back to this sonic again! Worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"Love this Sonic, it's in a decent proximity of  my home. The staff is always kind and the service is prompt. I enjoy going here for their happy hours from 2-5 for the half price drinks and slushes! The food is always hot and fresh, love the chili cheese coneys! Their ice cream treats are also quite tasty. It also helps that they're open 24hrs so you can satisfy any late night craving!!"}
{"text":"This place just plain sucks. I've been to many Sonic establishments across the states, and this one is the worst. It typically takes anywhere from 10-15 minutes to place an order, and another 15-20 to get it. Seems understaffed, and employees are inexperienced. I encourage others with this experience to write a review on Sonic's website, so they look into these issues."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much because of bad reviews. They have a new manager and she is fantastic! The old one was rude and took forever for your food. We pulled up and not a minute later, fresh, hot chicken strips and tater tots. The shakes were rich and creamy with lots of flavor. The girl who delivered it was sweet, smiling and prompt. Impressed."}
{"text":"Stop by to buy a cheeseburger and large ice tea. The ice tea had more sugar then tea in it. You have to be really dumb to mess that up"}
{"text":"Every time we have come in the past few weeks to order a sonic blast or any ice cream item the Ice Cream machine is \"broken\". So is it that no one cares to fix it? We dont come here for the food we come for a shake or sonic blast and every time we are turned away because the machine is still broken. This place has crappy service and apparently no one is trained correctly.  nasked for a mango limeade slush since the ice cream machine was broken and let me tell you what I got a cup of flat sierra mist with mango syrup. The drink on the menu was orange and mine was clear. This all after waiting 20 mins to get it. Im done with this Sonic."}
{"text":"Basically, this location sucks. Every time I come here, no matter what time of day, it's soooo slow! I don't understand why- they only have 4 or 5 employees just standing around talking about the most inappropriate crap ever.

Todays visit really annoyed me.

I was in the drive-thru and the first guy who helped me was nice but for whatever reason, some idiot decides to come ask me if we needed ketchup or any sauce. Of course, I tell him yes and he disappears.
Guy #1 come back and gives us our food and we leave. As were leaving, I checked the bag and noticed that there was no ketchup or anything in the bag. Cool, now I have to waste more time because this idiot decided to pop into my order and then decides to not even do the ONE thing he was supposed to do? Annoying.
Get a new staff- maybe things will improve.

Oh, and thanks for the cup of ice cream with a pinch of crushed Butterfingers. What kind of bu**s*!+ is that!?!"}
{"text":"So my disclaimer here is that I have never tried Sonic before, believe it or not -- never!

This is probably not a location that you want to drive any amount of distance to get to, so unless you're in the immediate area...

With that said, food and service was fine -- food is reminiscent of an A&W Restaurant but with the wild-n-crazy drink menu that gets played up in Sonic's commercials. Service was pretty fast, and the server changed my drink order w/ no problem after I decided to not be boring and switched my Diet Coke to a watermelon slush.

And who knew that there is \"Sonic Radio,\" complete with a super-chipper Sonic DJ?! I didn't get the chance to take in much of what was being broadcast to the parking lot though -- when it's 106 degrees outside, I learned that I take my food with the windows up and the A/C on..."}
{"text":"Worst ever had. Ordered a master blaster and get five pieces of cookie dough! Wtf?!? I'll keep my business at DQ"}
{"text":"Barely anyone here, and the drive thru is backed up basically to the entrance. Waiting 20minutes for a hot dog and sweet tea. 

Is this not fast food? Isn't everything well prepped? Maybe the management isn't prepared to be management.

Another bad experience at Sonic for this fella"}
{"text":"I showed up to the closest location (which is a mile from my house) at 11:40 wanting only an ice cream. And instead of accomodating me for the 20 minutes they're advertised to still be open, they said they were closed and redirected me to another location, witch would be only open for the same amount of time. By the time I got to the other location, they'd ACTUALLY be closed, not just closed for convenience. Never have I recieved such disservice."}
{"text":"Be careful going to this location at night. I ordered my food and a lady by the name of Carol B helped me. She had a funny pungent odor as soon as she handed me my bags of food. So I began to eat my food when all of a sudden I felt something stringy after one bite of my burger and it was hair! It definitely did NOT belong to me. I went back to get a refund and she asked where did I find it, and I explained where. The cook even leaned in to wonder what happened and he \"seemed\" shocked. Wont go to That location ever again."}
{"text":"This is definitely the most incompetent Sonic I've ever been to, with us encountering at least 1 issue each time I stop by. The only reason I continue to frequent this location is because it's near Rachel S' work so it's one of the only places we can go when I visit during her lunch breaks. Typical issues with this place include over/under-charging us, getting our order wrong or taking 15+ min to get our order which usually only includes a few chicken strips, tots and iced teas. 

If you still decide to come here, you've been warned! Do stop by on Wednesday evenings though for Wacky Pack Wednesdays, where kid's meals (aka wacky packs) are only $1.99!"}
{"text":"Food is great and on par with other Sonic locations, but this location takes their time getting your food ready in comparisson...especially if you go through the drive thru window! If you go through the window then expect to be in line a while because they're not as quick as they should be. Probably an understaffed location is my guess."}
{"text":"This is a good Sonic. It is what it is. Not the best food and there's worse. It was hot, except for the tots. They were lukewarm at best. The chili dog was really good. The burger was also quite tasty. The location is a bit sketchy as others mentioned. Not great late at night."}
{"text":"I love Sonic. The corn dogs, tater tots and cherry lime aide. But the service here is not always the best. They are fast, but my food is seldom correct. My advice is if you have a special order give it to them last."}
{"text":"40th Street and Greenway Sonic is the best! The food here is always HOT not warm, and if something is wrong with your order, just talk to the manager who takes care of the problem (only happened once to me). All the employees smile, gives you their name, asks if they can get you anything else, even offer to take your garbage to throw away for you. They show appreciation for your business. 
I live closer to another different one that I refuse to go to as the manager has turned grumpy, to bad I will just go to 40th Street for my meals."}
{"text":"25 MINUTES IN THE DRIVE THROUGH

Absolutely ridiculous. I don't care how busy you are, Sonics gets no busier than any other fast food chain and I've NEVER had to wait 25 minutes in a DRIVE THROUGH"}
{"text":"I've been here probably 5 or 6 times and every time there's been something wrong with my order. One time it could be ice in your non iced coke or my most recent visit where they gave me french toast and fries when I ordered a burger and fries. Fries were old and cold too. All that after a 10 minute wait. Another visit they made me wait 15 minutes, gave me wrong sauce and forgot my wings. This was the first sonic I've been to, ever. The food is usually good, when fresh, and most of the time nothing to complain about too much. However after the 2 bigger mishaps I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"I guess the third time is a charm. I was going to give Sonic one more chance, Reno Sonic sucks dick, Fullerton sucks bigger dick. Scottsdale Sonic your the best. I have been wanting a slushy forever and you made it happen. My cherry slushy hit the spot. One of the kids ordered a chili dog, we laughed for the longest time. We didn't expect a footlong and with a bunch of pre-teens, you know our minds were in the gutter. It was fun, hope to visit again sometime soon."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I always order the same thing. There's one cashier that knows me, and she is awesome. She never messes up my order. Everyone else has issues remembering size, flavor and which goes with which. Also, I think the store in general doesn't know the meaning of easy ice, as we can get 2 route 44s, one with easy ice, and they both are packed full of ice. I hope the people here get paid a ton of money, as the job seems really difficult. It's funny that at places like McDonalds and in n out where I order much more complex food orders, and food/drinks for multiple people on a regular basis, they ever mess up my order. Yet, almost every time I come to Sonic, they have difficulty with my simple drink order. I also have a friend who was fired from here because the manager was impatient and short, I wonder if this place values speed over customer service, because you shouldn't fire a new employee for being slow when learning, especially when it's their first time.
Please do something, Sonic."}
{"text":"Standard Sonic. If you like Sonic, you'll like it here. Fun Fact: we shot a pick-up scene for a porno here in Jan of 2010."}
{"text":"Yay for sonic!!! This is a busy location but always fun!"}
{"text":"Theyre burgers are awesome ! What makes it even better is happy hour on slushies and a great variety of flavors to choose from ! Im from la and my cousins stay down the street from here so every time I come down I have to hit this sonics up"}
{"text":"My first time at Sonic, I almost didn't go due to bad reviews.. 

My food is hot and edible. Nothing's missing in my order but with minor mistake. I said through the speaker, \"free birthday shake\" and they corrected the charge. And yes, I always check my receipts. 

Corndog, American Dog, Mozzarella Sticks are awesome! I wish I ordered more corndogs. I didn't like the Ched R Pepper, should've sticked to popular items.

Banana shake is tasty. I also added a large coke when I drove to the window and added more condiments -- I was expecting an attitude (again,due to terrible reviews) but didn't get it (plus points)!

It's Christmas Day today at 10:11am, probably slower than regular times/days."}
{"text":"Always be sure to check your order before you leave to make sure it is complete. Every time I've stopped here they have managed to mess up my order, to the point where I discovered half of the food I ordered was missing when I got home on one occasion. There is also a sewer vent or a grease trap or something right next to the drive through and the smell from it can cause you to lose your appetite while you are waiting to order."}
{"text":"Ah yes our late night stop whenever we are feeling hungry. We literally will just sit here and eat and talk all night. Usually we get the tots, grilled cheese, ched r peppers, and popcorn chicken. Great food, fast and nice service."}
{"text":"My review is based on the customer service only and not the food itself. 

Today mark's what my PT clinic likes to call \"dollar day\" at Sonic. On dollar days, we buy coneys from Sonic for all our providers, techs, front desk staff, and even patients. We buy enough hotdogs for anyone who's hungry. Our providers are so dedicated to their patients that it's not uncommon for the staff to skip lunch. Dollar days at Sonic are just a fun way of making sure everyone eats something tasty.  

Today, I drove up to the drive-thru where a friendly voice introducing herself as Lindsey comes on to take my order. I ask for 15 chili cheese coneys, at which point, Lindsey tells me \"There's actually a limit of 5 hotdogs to make sure we don't run out and we have enough for all our customers.\"

A couple things go through my head. 

1) You knew this day was coming. It was advertised. Are you saying you're anticipating being unprepared? 

2) I never saw a limit on any signage that was used to advertise for this day. However, that may have been an oversight on my part so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. I've never had a limit imposed on me before but who am I to argue? 

Bottom line, I promised our staff they would have chili cheese dogs and I wasn't about to come back without enough food for everyone. So I respond with, \"That's fine. I'll just drive around a couple more times.\" To which she bluntly replies, \"Okay.'

I get to the drive-thru, pay for my food with a super pleasant guy named David and drive back around. 

Lindsey is back on the intercom and I order another 5 coneys. She quickly and coldly responds with, \"That'll be $5.40 at the window.\"

Now, at this point, I can tell she was annoyed and I get it. She just knows I'm taking advantage of a good deal. She has no idea I'm feeding a hungry army. 

I get to the drive-thru and David tells me the total. Only, this time his tone is also laced with annoyance and I'm already starting to feel badly. My heart is already sinking. I don't want to be that guy that everyone hates. It's a horrible feeling and that's the emotion that starts creeping in. Now David is in a unique position where he can actually see me whereas Lindsey only knows my voice. 

Soon after paying for my food, David opens the window and hands me the box of coneys with a curt \"Here you go\" and he quickly closes the window behind him. 

At this point I feel like crap. I don't even want to go back around to order the last five hotdogs. But I do it anyway.

I go back around and Lindsey's voice comes through loud and clear. In my most overly-giddy and polite voice (I was a little extra), I order four more coneys. Why four? Because I don't want them to run out. Haha. Kidding....I wanted to say that but I would've felt like an ass so I didn't. 

This time, Lindsey only says the total - there is no politeness left in her voice. I drive up to the window to pay for these last coneys where I notice a woman pulling David out of the way and swiping her card. I'm assuming this is Lindsey and she wants to put a face to the voice. Sure enough, the receipt says her name is Lindsey. She takes my payment and leaves David to finish the interaction. 

David hands me my order and says, \"Here are your last four hotdogs.\"  I don't know what he meant by that but that's what he said. Before he had a chance to close the window, I asked for ranch and mustard. He gave me one packet of ranch and three packets of mustard. That's it. For 14 hotdogs. 

I drove away thinking about everyone at the clinic and how happy they would be; hoping that would take me out of my funk, but my spirits are dampened. I lost any appetite I had which is just as well. Our staff was happy and those hotdogs flew like hotcakes. I tell myself I did it for them but that doesn't lessen the ache I feel when I think about how cold and dismissive the staff at Sonic was today. I won't be going back. They already know my voice and now they know what I look like. 

I'll be making the drive to Wienerschnitzel instead."}
{"text":"Absolutley the worst sonic by far.  Pull up to order and push the button and keep waiting.  Finally after 5 minutes go thru the drive thru and they say oh yeah a lot of those are broken.  No signs up nothing.  Go thru the drive thru the next time and wait there for 3 minutes for any service.  If your want to be able to at least place your order don't go here."}
{"text":"It hits the spot. Thats really all i got, typical fast food, with a drive in twist, you're served by employees on roller skates, which in my book is an accident and workers compensation request waiting to happen. My knees could never handle that.

From 7-7 its Cone Happy hour, so you can try one of their cones for half price, they have a big assortment of toppings and flavors.

My usual is getting a chili cheese \"coney\" as they call them, some tater tots, and a large cherry limeade slush.

I went out of my comfort zone this time and got a watermelon jolly rancher slush ( best idea Ive had since removing my nose piercing), i got a chicken sandwich on Texas toast (heaven for a fast food joint) and fries this time.

Ive never had a bad meal from here, i certainly wouldn't say its state of the art of the best ever but its definitely worth the quick bite i dont feel like cooking tonight trip."}
{"text":"One review said, \"Inconsiderate and lazy\" describing the employees here. Agreed. It was once an acceptable place to grab a quick drink, etc. Over the last year I've only been here a couple of times but it's very obvious the kids working here (especially the boys) just want to get through their shift. The owner of this franchise should really be very concerned."}
{"text":"I ordered online through the new service because of a groupon deal I bought. The service was, eh. I drove up and told them I was there to pick up an order. The order confirmation told me my food would be ready at 2:16 pm (02/29/12). We waited a good 5-10 minutes after it was already 2:16pm. It was not busy. Online it asks you to choose EXACTLY what you want on the order. For example,when you order the Jumbo popcorn chicken it asks what type of sauce; I chose barbecue, and it didn't come with the sauce, we had to ask before the gentlemen left. They also charge you an extra .10 cents for a cherry. My cherry limeade had no cherry. I mean it may just be .10 cents, but that's an extra charge!
I was not pleased with this Sonic. This was the first and last time I do a transaction online with Sonic. If they can't do it the correct way, why even do it at all? Even the receipt I received showed exactly what I wanted and paid for. 
The gentlemen who served us was very nice and polite, so I have nothing bad to say about him, I wish I knew his name."}
{"text":"What a horrible location. Asked if a promotion was still going on and was rudely told it wasn't! Ok... well I ordered ONE item, a large order of tater tots w/cheese please thank you very much. $3.54. WTF? Damn Sonic is expensive! (I really wanted Smashburger fries but had to settle for them) I pay at the window, and wait.. wait.. wait.. wait.. then I hear the girl say \"where are the tots? Another employee says something, I don't really watch him I just see there are four employees crammed by the register. One is sitting on the counter! I'm heated now. I wait some more. Forget it. I drove off. 5 1/2 minutes for tater tots. I was the only one in line. Sonic sucks. 
And I knew that but went there anyway so I guess I have to take some blame."}
{"text":"Ugh... Normally I go to the Sonic on Warm Springs by Eastern and I wish I had gone there as usual.  I will never be going back to this one and I don't know if I will ever go back to Sonic in general again this place ruined it for me.  My boyfriend and I went here yesterday 7/31/13 around 10:30 PM and used the drive through.  All we ordered was one small and one mini ice cream blast with no other cars in front of us we got to the window gave them the money and then it took them almost 10 minutes to get us our ice cream... We would have just left if we didn't already give them the money.  As far as I know my boyfriend did not have a problem with his Reese's blast.  Me on the other hand I got an Oreo blast enjoying it until I got a weird stringy thing in my mouth it wasn't a hair I'm not quite sure what it was my boyfriend told be it looked like a bug leg...EEEEKKS! I don't think it was that either, HOPEFULLY!  Anywho it was not the only one that was in my blast and I am super grossed out and will NEVER be returning!!!!   GROSSSSSSSS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This Sonic is really hit or miss. Usually they have good service but the last couple times we have been there it is going down hill. The crew at night sounds a bit immature at times and not always sure of what they are doing. They really need to retrain some people."}
{"text":"I pretty much only come here for drinks and ice cream since i know how greasy their food is. I have a couple of issues with this location:

1. They always mess something up. One time, I ordered a cookie dough shake, and it came with absolutely NO COOKIE dough. Its just a \"flavoring\" so I asked them to add cookie dough and the person who took my order (I could barely hear her she was so quiet) told me that the shake only comes with the flavoring, AS IF I SHOULD KNOW THAT.  
2. My second problem was I had ordered a strawberry cheesecake shake with no whip cream. And when you ask for no whip they just put a flat drink lid on it so I asked to keep the dome lid. My drink came witha flat lid and i was disappointed because i like to eat my shake and not drink it.

Despite the (constant) mess ups, they are minor and the place is full of kids. A boy named Julio (i think) took our order and served it to us was so nice and polite."}
{"text":"BLESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS THIS SONIC!!!!!!!! Only place that knows what \"extra mustard please\" means!!!! My mouth is P*A*R*T*Y*I*N*G! Patient employees when I don't know what I want, they ask you if they don't understand what you said, always smiling, always quick, can't go wrong with this location! I'm so satisfied, you've made a pregnant girl happy today! Keep it up guys"}
{"text":"Wow this place amazes me with the service I receive when I come here. If I could give no stars I would. The only reason I came here again is because it's so close but forget it... I'm so done with this location... Rude people on the intercom whom have absolutely no patience and will hang up the Mic if you take too long *if your family has a question* I have received multiple wrong orders and it seems as if all the staff here really doesn't care about the customers. I realize that it isn't a career but the least the associates could do was to try and care.... F- sonic management never coming here again. I'm disgusted...."}
{"text":"Met up here with some friends who lived in town as we were driving across the state. We figured Sonic was a good choice because 1.) it's fast 2.) it's cheap 3.) it's freakin' yummy, even if it does tear up your tummy 4.) we could sit outside with our doggies.

We sat at a table and ordered on the microphone in the middle of the seating area. It literally took us SEVRAL attempts at conveying our message to the person on the other end of the speaker - not sure if it was the speakers fault of the employee or the wind outside or what, but we figured it would be worth it if our order was solid. Of course it was quite incomplete and messed up. I will say, though, that most Sonic food makes me feel super sick afterwards (a small price I am willing to pay for such culinary deliciousness), though this bought didn't make me feel all sorts of yuck afterward. 

Overall, you get what you pay for at Sonic. Thankfully, we were able to eat here with our doggies in the shade for cheap and spend more than our afforded amount of time taking up space at their tables. For that, I thank you, Sonic."}
{"text":"Yet another bad experience here at Sonic. I think this was my last chance. When I come up to a drive-thru, I don't appreciate being greeted with \"What do you want?\" What happened to customer service where employees greeted you with a proper greeting? Where they at least pretended to enjoy their job? Those days are gone for Sonic and their management team I suppose."}
{"text":"This is the worst customer service I have ever had. I spent 25 minutes in their drive through line waiting for ONE cheeseburger while they cranked out drink orders and shake orders for multiple cars BEHIND ME!!! People behind me were pulling off with their order while I wasted my entire lunch break waiting for one plain cheeseburger, that I only got after I complained. I was told they just got a new manager and that was the reason for the delay. Sounds like they didn't do that great of job hiring a manager considering he/she is literally the cause of the problem. In the end I couldn't even feed the burger to my kid because it had pickles and mustard on it which I did not ask for. I will never go back there again unless I'm in the mood to throw money away on food that never comes."}
{"text":"I love sonic the food is so good !! I always have a great experience at any of the locations!! I always recommend all of my friends and family to go to sonic !!"}
{"text":"This place hasn't changed in Years- whoever owns, manages and works at this place should be ashamed.  30 min wait every time, orders are rarely correct, and sadly I went back thinking it could only get better!  I was wrong, its horrific, embarrassing, this place exemplifies all that's wrong with this country. Don't give your money to these 'people'"}
{"text":"The sonic here makes an awesome milkshake. Fast food milkshakes are hit or miss but they've been hits here. The problem is, it's 10:22 PM and I've been sitting here in the drive thru for the past 20 minutes. The good news, coconut cream pie shake is delicious. Be patience or leave, your call."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night,  and had ice cream sundaes.  They were awesome.   The customer service was simple but good."}
{"text":"Lets start with the food, I get it fast food, but seriously 2 stars are for the food. Service was horrible, I can my card through the card reader next to me, and five minutes later a chubby 16 year old comes with my food, telling me I didn't pay... I told her yes I have, I just paid about 5 minutes ago, she looked at me like a deer in head lights...telling me over and over again I didn't...after she went back inside and checked that I in fact did pay she came back pretty much chucked my food into my window and walked off...seriously that's rude. Customer service is horrible."}
{"text":"I had to try it when i was passing though.
I must say for fast food, this stuff hits the spot.
I had the chili-cheese dog with Fritos on top and fries and YEA BOI, that was good stuff.  So i hate to admit it but i went back again the next day to grab me one of those big Ol' bacon double cheese burgers and as messy as it was it was what i needed to complete my fast food euphoria.  
I am a true Sonic fan now.  As far as chain store fast food goes, this is my go to place when i am traveling in Ohio."}
{"text":"Check your change!!!
I came here late night and ordered a drink. Paid with a $20 bill and after getting the change and the drink was backing out of the spot to drive off but thought the bills seemed a little light and that I should count them. I did and it was short $5. I pulled back in and as I was pressing the button for service, the boy that originally delivered the drink was at my window. Apparently he was watching. When I told him, he produced a $5 from his apron a little too conveniently to be coincidence. It was late and I was looking to get home quick or I would have called the manager on it. I should have, but I had my change so I just left."}
{"text":"I don't know how you don't know how to make a simple burger right! I was on my way to work and wanted to stop and eat. and this isn't the 1st time ive been to this place and its the same thing. now this time the manger took care of me without a problem so I will give him that but man im not going back to this place for a while!"}
{"text":"Almost every single time we've got here the ice cream machine is down. What kind of ice cream business that can't seem to get the one machine working properly. They should at least have sign that says ice cream machine is down so people don't have to wait in line to find out there is no ice cream!"}
{"text":"Started my experience by pulling up to an  individual ordering kiosk, where I pushed the button three times over the course of 15-20 to no response. All while seeing the drive through line continue at a decent speed. That is until I joined it, where I sat for another 15 minutes before ordering and waiting what? You don't say!! Another 15! I order a large slush.....its 108 today in Arizona an I wanted a cold slush I was committed to getting so I stuck it out however next time I have the craving it would be quicker for me to go buy syrup, ice and a blender, drive home an do this myself."}
{"text":"Personally I like McDonald's better.  I had a cheeseburger with tator tots and the flavor was lacking.  The chicken strips were good.  My son loved those.  I was so excited to try Sonic for the first time and was greatly disappointed. Maybe we will try something else next time we are near a Sonic."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive returning to another Sonic after some really bad experiences at locations in California but eating here made me a believer again. Needless to say I've been back twice since the original visit and its starting to show."}
{"text":"Love their Cherry limeade. This location's servers are actually on skates! 

People need to remember this is a fast food joint, dont expect 5 star food here."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Sonic on road trips a few times, when there is nothing else around it's a good choice. But they opened this new place and I've had to go back a few times. The double cheeseburger is massive. I don't get anything else with it because it's more than I can eat. Then the special came, burger, fries and drink, hamburger was just the right size, I was prepared to be disappointed, price just too good to be true thing, we'll have to say it was good too. Hubby likes the chili hot dog, so he usually gets the big one. Went and had cold fries, they sent out hot ones right away, I have no complaints, we don't go often but if we want a good quick burger we go there. In our travels, we stopped at a Sonic in Kansas, they had a pork tenderloin sandwich I loved, have not been able to find it anywhere at other Sonics, I hope one day they might bring it here as a special. I know when it gets really hot we won't be going here, it's just to hot to eat in your car, and you feel rushed, with car running and air going. But happy to see one closer to home, when I really want fast food."}
{"text":"Chicken nuggets are way overfried and potato fries are cold, hard, and way too dried out. Please recheck the timing for the food. Also, soda is out of gas. The sundea that I tried was too sweet that made me gag. I dont understand why this place serve such under qualified products. Should the managers or anyone bring more attention to this location?"}
{"text":"Had a hamburger a long time ago, nothing special. Definitely not in the same league as In-and-out.

Scumbag company advertises by littering on your vehicle. My BMW is not a mailbox, stop leaving your junk on my car and keep your dirty hands off my car.

Zit faced kid in a Sonic uniform litters throughout my business park, I will now NEVER buy anything from this business, well off to Google to leave another one star!"}
{"text":"I normally get the chili cheese tots, but this time was all about the Oreo Peanut Butter Shake. It totally hit the spot. I am one happy customer today."}
{"text":"As with the other Sonic, off of Union Hills, this one is equally as great.  The waitress that came out to the car was super friendly, smiled a lot, and the food was outstanding!  Absolutely no complaints! 

Keep up the Great Job!"}
{"text":"So slow! Not sure what the issue is with this location but they need help. I've been on 2 different occasions and both times they took forever. 

The food is fine but next time I have a sonic blast craving I may have to think of an alternative."}
{"text":"Walking distance from my work however I will never make that journey again. The burger meat  was so small you could call it vegetarian. There was a cute girl there but she was not vey nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst sonic ever, we ordered a blue coconut slush, a root beer float and cinnamon stacks. We waited about 20 minutes and noticed people were pulling and and out with their items and we still had not got ours. We pushed the button to chat with them waited another 10 minutes and a girl came out and said \"oh my okay one second\"
Came back out right away and gave us our items, obviously they were made when we ordered 30 minutes ago and just sat because the ice cream slush was water it was so gross, the root beer float had zero ice cream because it was melted I drank none of it because it was like milk water. The cinnamon stacks were ice cold And soggy! I will never bring business here again and you should not either. What happened to your standards sonic!"}
{"text":"Omg do not come here I placed an order for 45.00 and some change get to the window and hand the guy the change and a 100.bill we waited and waited for along time still they hand me the food and we keep Waiting!!!!!!!my food mean while is getting cold till finally I gave them back their food and demanded my money I was so mad then the guy hands me my money but as I counted it I was short 3.00 they stole 3.00small price to pay to never come back!!!!warning don't come here they will steal ur money if u pay with large bills cause of course a person won't notice until they actually count their money they were so rude and inconsiderate that the food was getting cold I was going to go back but decided not to I was just happy enough to get out of their they can keep those 3.00 and hopefully they put it towards buying some better customer service !!!!!!theifs!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had no service issues at this location, we only went for the shakes which are fantastic, only problem is too many choices! Never ate thier burgers (I don't eat meat) so I can't comment on that."}
{"text":"Everytime I order a blast they always missing one ingredient.. Like learn your blast. Also they take super long for blast and I'm always waiting and watching the people that came after me leave. Very annoying."}
{"text":"I understand that fast food places usually hire young students/adults .....but these kids are rude slow and slooooow. Everytime I go thru the drive thru I feel like I'm repeating my order 3 times before they get it right. Or they high??? Then you have to wait .....which I understand but you would think my order would be right by the time I get up to pay. Every time....its ridiculous I have to check my bags yo make sure I got everything....in ALWAYS missing at least 1 item. SHEEESH come on people. 

Also ..  The next time someone rolls up to your window and you are \"closed\" it'll be nice just to be told that and not have the lights turned off on you when you pull up...how RUDE."}
{"text":"Terrible service the woman on the drive thru was so rude and literally kept us waiting every time we asked a question . GO somewhere else especially if you're in a rush because you can't order inside only have to wait and hope you get your order taken in the car"}
{"text":"Forgot half my order, the burger were dry AF. This sonics really needs to get their  straight. I asked for sauces and they didn't give them to me. Drove away only to realize the forgot to give me my cheesy tots, had to drive back. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the concept. We have visited a few times since it was built, each time we come back it's worse than previously. Both last time we came here and tonight many of the phones in the lobby didn't work. Tonight, our ordering station was distorted enough that it caused our order to be miscommunicated. Manager took care of it, but I blame the flawed ordering process. Combined with the way Sonic has been jacking their prices up, I think that tonight's experience has been enough to sour us on the brand entirely."}
{"text":"The drinks I got was fine but the blast was half full! I go a small and there was only a tiny bit of ice cream in it! And I got a chocolate one and it was mixed very poorly! I was very disappointed and at most times the drinks are not very well blended either. I still go but the one on Cheyenne is better at mixing the drinks. So I suggest to go to that one if ya want a good drink."}
{"text":"Who is supervising this place??? Went there tonight. Fries were cold. Burger tasted as if it had been sprayed with chemicals. I could not eat it. Workers had friends dropping by. Workers left to go outside to smoke. Not one worker wore gloves. The workers were playing catch with food. There were at least four different customers who got out of the car and returned their order. I spit my food out and drove off. I will never return. I do not want to risk my health for a burger."}
{"text":"Worst sonic in town don't even bother. Food is always cold, no matter what time of day or how many cars are in line it takes 20 min to get two drinks. The employees stand around laughing at their mistakes and are constantly giving diet soda instead of normal soda. I don't think anyone working there has ever had a job before."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken sandwich at the drive thru. Was told it would be 5-10 minutes which wasn't a problem. Took one bite and it was completely raw inside. Disgusting. Won't be going back!!"}
{"text":"Fast, courteous service, good value for the food. Have been coming here for years. Basically you pull in, hit a button, order, swipe your card and the fast food comes out with a smile a few minutes later. Usually the servers deliver the food, if you're parked at a stall, via skates. The skates idea is different and is unique to the Sonic Drive-In establishments. The drive-thru wait time is somewhat to be desired so be ready to wait a few extra minutes before receiving your order. However, if they're on the ball that day, they'll deliver a simpler order to your car even if you are two or three back first and then let you go. This is also a unique customer service feature to this and some other Sonic Drive-Ins."}
{"text":"I have given this specific location 5 tries. The first time we ate here years ago it was pretty good. 2nd through 5th time it's been the exact same experience. The quality of the sandwiches/burgers are atrocious. I don't know if we are unlucky and show up before the food spoils but, the lettuce is always like boiled cabbage and turning brown. It's never been fresh. I don't think we are paying for presentation or if presentation is a big deal but, it looks like the cooks balled the sandwich/burger up and tried to flatten it back out like a piece of paper.
The place constantly forgets items... sauce, ketchup, straws, napkins, etc. It's different every time ( so it's like a surprise! Yay.). I stopped getting ice cream drinks here because they do it the same everytime. Toppings encrusted in the bottom of the cup covered in vanilla icecream. Oreo shake? OK so oreos on the bottom... vanilla icecream... and then just not mix it properly. What's the point?
The only redeeming quality is the staff. They are very nice and courteous. the place just needs to reevaluate their quality and standards of preparing of food. Regular drinks are great. The \"real fruit\" drinks are great."}
{"text":"This is the third time I have gone to this location and the the rd time no cherry or lime in my cherry limeade drink!  Frustrating when you go to these places and the customer service in getting all things in your order."}
{"text":"Be wary..count you change. The food and drink were well enough. What stands out the most was the assumption that it was okay to take $1 without asking - aka stealing.

My bill came to $5.05 a NY Hot dog and a medium lime limeade. I gave the car hop $20.05. She said she needed to go inside to make change. Knowing that the car hops rely on tips, and despite waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my order, I gave the girl $1 tip before she could run away and before I counted my change - big mistake. After handing her $1 I had $13  in change. Calling her through the microphone I explained the situation. She offered no apology, saying she needed to go inside to make change.

Bad Service. Dishonest. Shameful. Unapologetic. Thoroughly arrogant or just plain stupid.

I'm sure its just one person: Ticket 387, 9/18/15 @21:36 cashier SH-O, Keyboard K-1"}
{"text":"service is always great- this place is always busy but the kids who work there try really hard to go fast. I feel bad for them sometimes because people are so impatient and they are just working their first job. nice kids working there- had to give them a shout out."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. Food was horrible! Employees seem to not care. They treated the customer before me horribly."}
{"text":"This Sonic location used to be pretty good. Now, I would call it average. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't have too many gripes about this location, but I've just noticed that the service and food quality has steadily declined since I first stopped in back in 2013. 

My first issue with this place are the prices overall. It seems like every time I stopped in, I wound up paying more than the time before for the same order. I always get the footlong coney with tots and a drink. 

The second issue here is the nonexistent speaker at the drive thru, which makes it nearly impossible to understand the person who is reading your order back to you. You would think Sonic would upgrade that speaker system, but nope, just keep yelling into it instead. 

Now, the food here is still decent. But for the price? Not much value there. As far as the actual service, they are alright. The kids who work there are decent, some are good. It just depends on the day that you stop in. 

Overall, I'll give this Sonic location a rather average 3-stars."}
{"text":"Ordered a footlong coney and tots, when I got home which is approximately 3 minutes away, the tots were cold and both the chili and dog on the coney were burnt. Returned order back to the location for refund! This is not the first time I've gotten bad food from there but I won't go back unless they improve their quality!"}
{"text":"Stopped back for a couple of blasts.   This place has horrible customer service.  We sat at the window of the drive thru for 18 total mins for 4 blasts.  At the 8 minute mark they handed us 2 said the other 2 would be right up and closed the window.  10 mins later the other blasts came.  No apologies, nothing just opened the window said\"here you go\" and was gone.  They came outside to serve at least 4 cars behind us while we waited for ice cream?    2 first 2 blasts were nice and melted as we were taking them home to our children.  

Almost every time you come through you there is someone at the window that does not speak english and the wait time is horrible."}
{"text":"Just went there last minute as soon push the button they told its close and close the lights on us..if you cant accomodate 1 customer you have a bad customer service.."}
{"text":"We decided to treat ourselves to a couple of corn dogs and a shake this last Sunday.  The corn dogs were mediocre at best, but even better: the young man who delivered our food to our car was going to keep my change had I not asked for it!  When I notified the manager, he did not seem to concerned, which makes me think this is an encouraged behavior.  Very disturbing.  I guess I will have to count my change in the future, if I in fact go back."}
{"text":"The food is just ok.  Nothing great as far as taste, shakes are good.  Reason for my review is the horrible customer service.  Rude taking your order in the drive thru or in one of the stalls.  Nasty attitudes.  Don't like the customer service field, then find another job."}
{"text":"Vegas is not complete without a fix from Sonic's. Those damn Chilli Dog and Tater Tots got us coming back for more. Try the Chocolate Peanut Butter Shake! It's good.."}
{"text":"I'm not a real big fan of fast food but we don't have a Sonic out in Hawaii so i had to check one out when I came to Vegas. I have a co-worker who has told me on a few occasions that the main reason to go to Sonics is the drinks. He was right as they have all sorts of cool refreshing beverages. It was fun seeing the girl roll out on her skates to give us our order (didn't know they still did that)."}
{"text":"Been to this Sonic two or three times. Had a stand-out visit this morning. Lots of Yelpers bashing the service but not the case today. 

Had to kill an hour for auto service so I got an Ultimate Meat and Cheese Breakfast Burrito. I was pleasantly surprised on multiple levels. 

The service was fast, efficient and pleasant. My order arrived five minutes after ordering. My burrito was tightly wrapped (rarely seen) with all the yummy insides spread throughout (usually limited to egg on one side, tot, cheese, etc on the other.)

After I left, I realized I had forgotten to ask for either salsa or napkins. What's a breakfast burrito without salsa? Boring!  But lo, there, in the bag, were two salsa packets and two napkins, along with two mints for morning burrito breath!

This Sonic rocks the food and the service!"}
{"text":"After a long night of partying, my girlfriend and I decided to grab a quick snack at sonic. She had been there multiple times before, while I was the sonic virgin. She was in charge of the ordering as I did not know. While we were ordering we felt that the order taker wanted to be anywhere but there! He gave short answers and was overall just rude ! We ordered popcorn chicken and a cream slush. We were the only other people there because it was late at night but you'd think that b was packed!!! It took 15 MINUTES to get our TWO item order!! What was he doing back there writing a novel?? When our food was brought to us you'd think this guys was a fish out of water! He was trying to practically throw our food into our car! After handing our drink he sprinted his butt back into the store. Didn't get his name but he seemed like a Jeremy. Jeremy if you're reading this, slow down life is a wild ride but take a moment to appreciate the people around you. Like me, a great guy who just wanted his sonic virginity taken. Overall would recommend to my dog, Mona."}
{"text":"I like coming here. I enjoy being able to sit in my car and eat my meal, playing the music I want to hear, or just in peace and quiet. They usually take my order quickly, and have my food ready in a reasonable amount of time. Sometimes they get my order wrong though (4 stars), but the food always tastes great! I swear I formed an addiction to this place at one point!! Haha!!! So good, always enjoy my experience :)"}
{"text":"Messed up my order. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger & received 2 Reg burgers. Made the special trip to Sonic for a waffle cone only to be told they were out of ice cream."}
{"text":"We have visited this same Sonic twice this week and we are about to drive away. 12 minutes waiting and we pushed the button twice again. Twice now we have gone to McDonald's. As we drove away we see there were 4 cars out of 20+ drive up ordering stations. This is a complete failure of yet another visit at Sonic."}
{"text":"Terrible. Cant ever eat there cause for some reason they cant accept my visa card and most other debit cards. Pitiful. Fix your card readers. Explains why this place is always dead"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would! Horrible car service!!! They took 45 minutes to give us our food and they got our order wrong, and charged us for tater tots that we didn't even get. Also the corn dogs were burnt AF. As well as they were apparently rationing their condiments because we got two ketchup packages for 4 corn dogs. Overall awful experience!! We could've flown back to LA and gotten our food faster! Unacceptable service this ain't not 5 star restaurant!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Sonic when I lived in NC, but since we moved to MD, there isn't one near me.  I revisited my long lost love while in Charlotte on vacation and was somewhat dissapointed.  I don't remember them microwaving their chili dogs and the tater-tots seemed very old....  The only reason I give it 3 stars is because the server was great.  He was very attentive and quick."}
{"text":"I come here on occasion on Friday mornings to enjoy a breakfast burrito and order my dog a patty. I have always been treated well and the food is always as expected. Can't wait for the summer to be over it is just too hot here for only outdoor eating."}
{"text":"I have given this location multiple chances, but they never cease to amaze me with their lack of customer service and ability to mix up orders. I pulled in during happy hour and order two drinks and two corndogs. The carhop came out with just the drinks and no recollection of me ordering corndogs. I asked him to add them to my order and it took an additional 10 minutes, on top of the 10 minutes I had already been waiting. I ended up driving away without any of my order. 

This is not the first time this is the situation. Time and time again they do not come out with the complete order, have the order incorrect or make me wait 15+ minutes.

Sadly, I will have to choose other options when trying to grab something quick and easy. Maybe other locations are better with customer service and accuracy"}
{"text":"I have never been to a Sonic, EVER, until last week. It has been on my list of places I'd like to try, and I did not know Cleveland had a sonic until a couple weeks ago, and right then and there, I just knew I had to go.

You cannot go inside to eat, you actually drive your car up to a post where you can order and someone will bring out the food to you. Now I was excited for the part where the girls come out with roller skates, but that didn't happen and I was slightly disappointed as that has been all I've seen in Sonic commercials over the years. Whatever, I got over that. Food came out within five minutes of ordering, the girl was friendly too. 

The food itself: I only got the burger to try, and it was just OK, nothing spectacular or mind blowing. It was very thin (I did not mind) but it left something to be desired with each bite. I was not impressed. Next time I will try their milkshakes, since that's what they seem to be more popular for."}
{"text":"Multiple visits.
Always quick service. 
Always good food quality."}
{"text":"This is by far the slowest location ever....

I've been here on numerous occasions because it's the closest one, and they are incredibly slow.

On one occasion I had to wait 45 minutes.

Usually it's 30 minutes minimum. 

 one time I did wait for 10 minutes which is acceptable. 

Every other location is 10 mins or less every time...

The cherry limeade is the best though......(all locations)"}
{"text":"Love Sonic, but this location always cracks me up. Called tonight to see what time they were open until, girl on the phone said 11pm, then busted up laughing and said 1am. We pull up 5 minutes later and the girl says the machines are updating and it'll be a 20-minute wait. We say never mind and drive through, only to pass all of the employees sitting on the table out front smoking cigarettes laughing and glaring at us. Too many places to cure that late night ice cream craving in Vegas, so I'm not too upset saying goodbye to Sonic. Hell it's just fast food, but thanks for the laughs though and tell your employees to keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Seriously the slowest service I've ever experienced. Been sitting in the drive thru for 30 minutes and not moved. I would pull out and leave but I'm blocked in. This is insane. 

If I wanted to wait for over 30 minutes for food, I would have gone next door to Cornish Pasty. At least I would be able to grab a beer while I waited...."}
{"text":"I usually have no problems with Sonic. They are a little pricy for fast food but they have a lot of options.  The orange cream slush I ordered was amazing as usual bit the chili cheese fries had barely any chili on them and seemed as of they had been over cooked in a microwave or something.  On a previous visit the flavoring in my shake was clumped at the bottom and not mixed in, and I have recieved cold cheese sticks on more than one occasion."}
{"text":"This place is kinda dangerous.  i usually get a hot fudge sundae with caramel and nuts and a chili cheese tator tots with ketchup, onion, and tobasco sauce.  i know, totally weird combo but it works for me.  Delish! and they are open till midnight."}
{"text":"Went here last night for a late meal. Ordered a cheese coney and a burger. Got home and took a bite of the cheese coney and it tasted disgusting. It was tough and hard to chew. Took a look at the hot dog and it was very dark brown colored, like it's been sitting all day. So I got back in my car and drove back to Sonic. I told the manager (who was taking orders at the drive thru) that I had a bad cheese coney. She said she would have a new one made. When it was my turn she immediately swapped places with another employee so she wouldn't have to talk to me while she hid in the back. I gave the old Coney to the worker and asked if he would eat that, and he said NO. What's wrong with managers these days?! The sign out front says something about Everything is Made Fresh, which is clearly a lie."}
{"text":"Went here last night. Got a grilled cheese and a hot dog only to get home and realize we only had the grilled cheese :("}
{"text":"I come for the drinks, not the food but their hot dogs aren't bad. The cranberry limeaid however is fantastic and a cool treat on a hot day. The frozen lemonade is great in the summer and their shakes are yummy. Stop by from 2 to 4 for happy hour to get half priced drinks."}
{"text":"I think this sonic is fantastic, my order got messed up a few days ago, when I called I spoke to a manager named Bret, he fixed the issue right away and told me I was more than welcome to come back and they would replace the order, he gave me no problems whatsoever and was very friendly. When I went back to get my correct order they got it out fast and it was fresh, and again the employees were very friendly, I would definitely recommend going to this location."}
{"text":"Fucking trash. The fat Woman working headset was such a cunt and completely incompetent for this entry-level job. Food was slapped together looking like a toddler prepared it. Extremely long wait time. This was my first time ever trying sonic and I have to say I'll never return. Fuck Sonic"}
{"text":"Worst location EVER!! Avoid... Avoid...Avoid 
The line will literally take you 30mins to get food! No joke! Could me 1 car in front of you and it will take them forever! I literally sat at the drive thru window for 15mins before. I asked the employee what was taking so long and she just said sorry."}
{"text":"So many good things to say about this sonic location, first I would say it's great to get a tasty burger and thirst quenching cherry limeade anytime of day. Second I can't ever remember having bad service the staff though they are young have the best customer service and are pleased to help make your experience the best.
I'm sure as most of you know you can't ever go wrong when stopping here to feed either a craving or just snacking. So enjoy and be kind to others yelp on!"}
{"text":"The drinks taste like fried food. Seriously. They are disgusting. Every swallow has a mozzarella stick aftertaste. No need to ask for the chicken strip flavoring, it's already in there."}
{"text":"I've love down the street from this sonic. The service has always been good and the food quality is great. I don't ever recall an excessive long wait when it's been slow but things happen at every business and one off instances don't require you to blow your load and drop a 1 star review for real word situations that arise at ANY business anywhere. Not enough people go out of their way to write something positive these days....."}
{"text":"I just ordered a jr burrito, and small mozzarella sticks.  You would think they could get it right. Nawww.  I asked for BACON BURRITO!"}
{"text":"It's 108 degrees outside and I'm having an argument with the lady trying to take my order. She cant hear me through the drive thru speaker system and I can hardly understand her.***Management Please Upgrade this poor system you have*** I finally pulled ahead and reviewed my order with this lady. After sitting about 10 minutes I got the order and no drinks. WTH!! Oh well. It was my 1st time here and probably my last as I wasn't even ordering for myself. ( I wouldn't eat here)"}
{"text":"Went to the drive-thru looking looking and waited and waited at the drive-thru finally I had a yell and then they responded I ordered with three food items and when I pick them up all three of them were wrong. I called the store when I found out the order were wrong and I got absolutely zero response what a dump"}
{"text":"Went for the $2.99 burger and onion rings they've been advertising all over Tv. 
Ordered the burger with only mayo and ketchup. They repeated it back at the speaker and again at the window but sure enough I get home and it has everything on it. Oh and they were out of onion rings. 
Called them back to tell them about it and they pretended like they couldn't hear me. Fail all around."}
{"text":"Once again a horrible experience and unprofessional service from the \"manager\" Bailey.  I come to this place almost daily and there is almost always an issue. Today my cheesy potato burrito came black greasy eggs that came from a dirty girl. I call and ask for a manager and get Bailey. I tell her what happened and her reply is \"ok.\" I reminded her that we always have issues and her manager has told me that he would address this and get it fixed. She either isn't being talked to or because they are a franchise she thinks its ok to disrespect customers and provide poor service. Now since I've complained so many times and let her know how I feel she claims she is being harassed. She's funny. But this needs to be corrected. I'm sick of this service and I won't be going to another location. This one is too close to my home. I have pictures of this burrito that doesn't look like it came from a gast food restaurant and will be contacting the health dept as she told me they only clean the grill once at night. Funny thing is I order the SAME thing every time and this is the 1st time this location served ne greasy black and kinda yellow eggs."}
{"text":"Place sucks.  Messed of food order and had to come back.  Bad Customer Service skills."}
{"text":"I never get food here, or even ice cream.
 The food is waaay too salty, the ice cream hurts my stomach.

I love happy hour though! Only time I ever come to Vegas.

My last time here I got a ice tea...and yea...the tea melted the ice...that sucked."}
{"text":"Sucks. They are do slow. Customer service is horrible. I wish there were more Sonics around this area. They need management help!!!"}
{"text":"This location used to be great. I'm not sure what happened.

I placed an order for a boneless wing combo, plus two small drinks since it was happy hour. When I finally got up to the window to pay, and the employee read my order back to me, it was wrong. Totally okay, it was only off by two items, so I corrected him and he went back to correct it. I get that it's happy hour, it's a busy time, and these things happen. It's really not a big deal.

What wasn't okay was taking 20 minutes to fix a small error. All that was wrong was fries instead of tots for the combo, and adding one small drink they forgot to add. Literally 20 minutes at the window for that. When the cashier finally made contact with me again, he mistakenly read back a medium drink instead of a small drink. I just said that was fine because I would have been there for another 10 minutes if I would have corrected him again.

The correction took so long that one of the carhops delivered the orders to two people behind me in the drive thru. The employees knew it was taking too long - so what gives? They also charged me full price for the order, while other Sonic locations have given me orders for free for waiting half the time. Not that I'm trying to get anything for free, but this location isn't a normal Sonic Drive-In.

Avoid this location at all costs if you value your time and sanity. I won't be going back for a while."}
{"text":"The worst ever..food cold..bad customer service.. sat at the drive threw window for 10 min..thinking my food was going to be hot.  NOPE!!!!! ICE COLD SMH..NEVER GO THERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"We sat in our car for quite a while waiting for someone to answer our call. We were not at the drive through, we were at the drive-up, where the food is brought to you in your car. You could hear lots of talking coming over the speakers and could not tell whether it was the car next to you, or two cars away, or if it was just people talking inside the restaurant. It honestly sounded like a bunch of confused people. No one said please hold on or anything. We drove quite a way to get there and ended up just turning around and leaving."}
{"text":"Why do I continue to still go here? Cold fries and didn't get the ranch with my Ched'r peppers and no ketchup I asked for. Is It that difficult?"}
{"text":"I love sonic, but will never get another blast. I ordered a medium reese's blast with chocolate ice cream, which was really just vanilla ice cream with a little chocolate syrup and a few bits of reese's in about every third bite. From now on I will be going to culvers when I want a treat."}
{"text":"We had dinner there today. Very poor service. They didn't answer when we pushed the order button. The drive through was out of order. I went into the kitchen to make an order. We probably won't be back. So sad cause we like Sonic."}
{"text":"Service, terrible. Our \"waitress\" Clarissa had the personality of a brick wall and we apparently ruined her day by asking for extra Ketchup. Food was the things nightmares are made of. Pretty sure a Ethiopian would have turned it down. I remember when Sonic first came to AZ and there food was top     notch! Not today! Gonna have to cut this review short..... I think I got giardia from the fountain drink."}
{"text":"Took them 15 minutes to bring out 2 small milkshakes and people I was there before got their meals first. There were maybe 10 people there when I pulled up.( Two stars because a cat walked up and laid down under one of the tables and it was cute)"}
{"text":"Every time I go here the service is horrible! Today I received a burger that was both soggy and stale! They are so slow and not friendly or apologetic out the wait. I have seriously never been to a Sonic with such bad service!!! I love Sonic and used to go at least 2 times a week where I lived in Aurora, Colorado! This Sonic on Durango is closest to my house and it's sad because I can't go as much as I would like because of the wait time. What's wrong?"}
{"text":"Second time in 2 weeks I've gotten sick. Vomiting and of course only thing I've had all day. Both times. Two urgent care visits and both confirmed food poisoning. How hard is it to cook something properly, keep things sanitized & wash your hands."}
{"text":"So not only did they get my order completely wrong and the only answer I got was \"that was not what you ordered.\" The worst part was getting French toast sticks that tasted like chemicals. I even pulled over off of Warner as quick as possible to take one away from my 3 years old. I will never eat here again, nor will I buy anything from here for anyone else."}
{"text":"So I send customer feedback to Sonic today relaying their terrible rating and reviews at their Wexford location on Yelp, and that they should be reading these things and trying to correct them. I clearly stated that I checked Yelp before patronizing them. This is the response I received:

Dear Doug, Please let me know where you read such reviews about out Sonics.  I dont see anything online about us having issues with anything that you mentioned in this complaint that you called in even before visiting the location.  We have recently turned over all the managers at this location and it is running smoother then ever. Thank you for your feedback. Team Sonic (Mark Lull)

Wow! How's that for service? 1 Star for the personalized response. M i right?"}
{"text":"This is NOT a good Sonic. The wait is incredibly long, like restaurant wait-length long. Denny's can cook a grilled cheese faster than Sonic. They constantly run out of food. I have something like 94 little \"We owe you a free drink\" poker chips because nearly every time I go through the line they are out of something I try to order, from onion rings to tater tots to cheese to limeade. Drive-through boxes are always a joke, but these people are very hard to understand. If you speak \"fast mumble\" you'll be fine, but when I order a Coke and they ask me if I want ranch or marinara with that, you know something's getting lost in translation. Hard pass on this location."}
{"text":"It took me many years to finally go to a Sonic restaurant because where I am from does not have Sonic. Good food, service somewhat slow but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Got my drink order wrong again. This was the 4th time this has happened. I asked for a frozen strawberry limeade which is a slush drink and I got a regular limeade. No strawberry just a limeade. Even my receipt says frozen strawberry limeade. Beyond disappointed."}
{"text":"How are you going to advertise new creamery shakes but your employees have never tried them and can't tell me about them??? That's a sign that I need to take my fatass home vs drinking a shake at 10pm. **puts car in reverse**...Good night!"}
{"text":"Before heading out to our normal Charlotte dessert spot, I asked my sister in law to stop by the closes Sonic to grab a quick bite. When I saw this location off of the highway we decided to stop here. It is kind of hard to figure out which way to get into this location but we finally made our way in. After parking, we noticed you could come on side and sit at this location. Having never see this before at a sonic location, we decided to go in and eat inside. The phones need a little updating and the tables could have been cleaned a little better but it's pretty cool for a sonic. You can pick the phone up at any table and place your order. After the normal 3-5 minute wait time our food finally came out. The food was hot and fresh and tasted on point. There were also tvs inside with two different channels going. This location is pretty decent."}
{"text":"I really only come here for half priced drinks and mozzarella sticks. The few times we've ordered food it seems too expensive for what is is, and for what I'd pay, I can go elsewhere and get better burgers."}
{"text":"Worst service ever Manager Robert Eckert should not be a manager. I went through the drive through 2 weeks prior where I received cold food cheese was not even melted on my cold tots. I was taking my daughter to a docter appt. Therefore I could not turn around and go back so I called. The manager on duties apologized and said my name would be in the books for the next time I came back to replace my tots. I returned on a separate date when Robert Eckert said I don't have anything In The books what day was it. I told him the exact date and time because that was the day I took my daughter to her appt...He said well I don't have time to look it up so ill just give you new ones because I don't have time.....ummmmm excuse me me he is not doing me a favor I paid for them. I asked him to give me corporate s number he then gave me the wrong number because I called it right in front of him I also was Givin more tots before I asked for the number and I opened again cold tots with 4 pieces of chess not even melted I showed him and told him he could have them back. He did not make new ones by the way. I also told him he gave me the wrong number and I needed the real corporate number...he laughed i guess he thought i was not going to call then he went back and what a surprise he found the right number ...WORST SERVICE EVER .....DEAR MR John Allen you need to fire Robert Eckert"}
{"text":"Interestingly enough, I was going to write my review based on the employee interaction I had. Jetta beat me to it, so its obvious this location isn't known for outstanding customer service. I'll just sum up what happened last Thursday evening in my case. 

My boyfriend finally caved on my \"Can we go to Sonic, pleeease?!\" and we wound up here around 5:30pm. I had $30 in Sonic giftcards from Christmas I hadn't touched. Anyways, we decided on something and tried to order.

Employee: \"Welcome to Sonic, can I take your order?\" 

My boyfriend, in the driver's seat, closest to the ordering button, \"Yeah, hi. Can we get your special 'Sweetheart Shake' and...\"

Employee, interrupting him, \"We're out of peanut butter Reeses.\"

Boyfriend: \"Oh.. Okay.\" 

Employee: *Silent* 

Me: \"Is he still there?\"

Employee: \"Uhhh. Yeahhh!\"

Boyfriend: \"Okay, so we want the 'Sweetheart shake' and...\"

Employee: \"Have you guys ever had that?\"

Both the boyfriend & I: \"No, but we would like one of those and...\"

Employee: \"Its real good.\"


The conversation went on like this for quite a while. . .or at least, longer than it should have taken to place a fast food order. This isn't to say the kid wasn't friendly.. it was just.. weird."}
{"text":"I guess I should have looked at the reviews before I decide to eat a hot dog. Cold ,soggy, nasty not even sure it was edible. I was in a hurry and had to go fast, never again!"}
{"text":"Tube steaks.  Yes, tube steaks!

Here are some fun facts, or maybe urban legend.  Babe Ruth was reported to have once ate 12 hot dogs & 8 bottles of soda between games of a double header. He was rushed to the hospital after the game.  What a surprise, right?  

Al Capone's favorite food was???  Anyone?  Bueller?   Nathan's Coney Island!  What no Vienna Beef?  Today, Chicago's O'Hare sells more than 2 million hot dogs a year.  Now I am sure these dogs are Vienna Beef!

I bring this up, because about a year ago SONIC decided to broaden their hot dog menu, with four new dogs: All American, Coney Island, Chicago and New York.  This year they've added a 1/4 pound Footlong to their lineup of Tube Steaks.  http://www.sonicdrivein.com/MenuSection/coneys-hot-dogs

Admitted, I haven't been an SONIC aficionado up until now.  But, a \"shout out\" to my friend Jennifer W and her family, who must be considered the unofficial Queen of SONIC!  How do you stay so thin?

I was willing to give their new menu items a try.  First the bad news, these aren't Nathan's Famous, Hebrew National, or Vienna Beef.  They aren't even Oscar Mayer!  But, for $3.99 for a 1/4 pound footlong hot dog and Tater Tots, they're not bad.  And, a lot better than Der Wienerschnitzel!

BTW, the  World Record for hot dog eating is 68 set by Joey Chestnut at Nathan's Famous in Coney Island.  It was reputed that former Champ, Takeru Kobayashi ate 69 at a nearby location.  Ugh!~"}

Went by here on the way home one afternoon and got an order of French toast sticks and popcorn chicken , when enroute home Discovered the popcorn chicken was very hard I called back and spoke with the manager DeErica and she was very nice and said that she would replace everything even though it was just the chicken that was hard when I came back a couple days later to get my replacement as DeErica said she would put my name in the book for the other managers the manager that was on duty CHRISTINA was very RUDE she said that without a receipt she couldn't give me anything was trying to talk over me and everything and that the DeErica should not have done it that way and of course that triggered me to be rude and I was like you need to get with the Your co workers she was the one that told me to come back here and that my name will be in a notebook , well what do you want I want what she told me she would replace she said after I told her I wantHer name she then said well would you like a combo instead I told her no I want to replace what the manager before said she would replace I don't want anything extra from you I just want what I said I originally got she was very nasty !!! Christina was her name"}
{"text":"Went to this location for dinner, ordered no onions on burger, burger came with onions, asked if we could get a free refill on our drink as the rest of our order was right and by the time they fixed the bad burger soda was almost gone, they said no, come on, was a small drink, nice customer service on their screw up."}
{"text":"Try to find a better location. This one is constantly leaving out items that I ordered and paid for. It's so aggravating to get home only to find someone didn't get their food. Just today I had to go back and get a chicken wrap that my daughter ordered because it was not in the bag. So, when I got back home with her wrap, my food was cold. The staff there didn't even offer to give my money back. I'll just find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"Just came back from there, and was pretty disappointed. 

The inside dining area was a wreck (dirty tables, food on the floor, table side order phones out of order, etc).  They weren't particularly busy, and several employees were hanging around talking to one another.

My food came out relatively quickly, but was not complete, and even after alerting them of this and waiting on them, I had to remind them five minutes later to give me my missing items, at which point they seemed even more confused. 

To top it off, the restroom was filthy and there were no paper towels, and I even saw an employee go in and use the restroom, and come out without remedying the situation...hope he at least washed his hands :/
Given the state of this place, I have to wonder. 

I want to like this place, but it scored an F on this visit.  
Fast food doesn't have to be messy, crummy, and lacking in service...just look at chick-fil-a."}
{"text":"Came here because it is a friend's tradition to get sonics every time they are at Las Vegas. The food was decent, but nothing special. I might give them another chance but go for the hotdogs instead."}
{"text":"In the fast food world Sonic ranks right up there for four very important reasons:

Cherry Dr Pepper.

Tots.

Breakfast burritos.

Breakfast burritos with tots inside.

I'm not the biggest fan in the world of a Sonic burger.  Their chicken  sandwiches are ho-hum.  Their wraps are actually good, and if you get the grilled chicken one it's actually not too bad for you, either.  Nothing else on the menu really grabs me where it counts, ya know?  By no matter what, if I get it with a side of tots and a Cherry Dr Pepper I'm a happy girl.  Better yet, if I get one of their, frankly, pretty effing awesome breakfast burritos encapsulating not only the eggs and peppers and all that goodness but also acting as an edible treasure chest full of tots I'm over the moon!

Their soda fountain can't be beat.  I loved it as a kid and I love it now.  Although I'm pretty much firmly ensconced in the Cherry Dr Pepper camp, you can add one of TONS of flavors to any drink, not just your traditional chocolate, vanilla and cherry.  Orange, grape, watermelon, coconut, lemon, lime, strawberry - the list goes on and on.

It's still funny to see the carhops come out in their roller blades.  I know Sonic gave up it's trying-to-do-the-50s thing a while ago, but the roller blades still crack me up."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from Cody. Very professional and left a lasting impression."}
{"text":"Wowwww!!!! Let's talk about this place!?!?!?
So believe it or not this was my first time at Sonic even tho I work next door to them.
I am looking for the best chili cheese hot dog in town and a co worker mentioned that they had good hot dogs and also a foot long chili cheese hot dog so I could not wait to try it.
Since I was alone and in a hurry I decided to go to the drive through and not to wait in the parking lot as they have roller skater to bring you the food, they also have tables for you to eat there if you want. 
I got a foot long chili cheese hot dog and tater tots. 
My food came out fast and the guy who brought my food was REALLY nice. Normally in these fast food places the employees are not so nice but this time it was different. 
The hot dog was just AMAZING!!! And the tater tots crunch and not grease at all! 
So far this is the best hot dog that I've ever had, I will keep looking for a better one even tho I believe it might be almost impossible to beat their hot dog!"}
{"text":"Happy hour slushies! Two-for-one wing specials on Mondays! I'm a sucker for Sonic. The wings aren't great, but they're about as good as B Dubs. The slushies, shakes and limeade are amazing. Some of the best drinks in town. Put nerds in your slushies, try a caramel shake and real strawberries in the strawberry limeade. Try the drinks and stay for a few wings."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Sonic and I've got to say I was actually pretty impressed.  I had the double bacon cheeseburger and a Reese's Sonic blast and it did not disappoint.  Burger was nicely done with lots of flavor and the food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great American drive thru fare.

Hearty burgers and juicy wieners are a given here, with decent to good side items as well. Interesting flavored \"slushy\" drinks will appease the kids and creative shakes and thicker \"concrete\" ice cream desserts will finish off a good meal.

Sadly, things can take a turn for the unpleasant sometimes, due to the staff. Unprofessionalism abounds at this location and sometimes this means either a slightly incorrect order or long wait times.

I'd STILL recommend them though as what's on offer is a summer staple and really, you go to places like this for the kids anyways...and they'll enjoy themselves and come away full."}
{"text":"Horrible, just horrible. Not only do they take foreverrrrr but they are so rude!! I stopped by just to get a few drinks and the girl working there messed my order up and I corrected her she was quick to say \"oh I'll fix that right away\" which is totally great BUT SHE FORGOT ONE THING... to charge me less for what she messed up on??? I paid way more because she added all this extra stuff to my order that I did not ask for, nor did I receive the things I was unwillingly charged for. Then on top of all, they declined 3 different cards o was going to pay with before I gave up and decided to pay with cash..I figured that must have been an issue on my/my banks part but as soon as I got home I called ALL three banks and nothing was wrong and the error was on their part. Thanks Sonic."}
{"text":"If you have to eat fast food in the area then I guess this is the best place but I still don't recommend it.

The grilled cheese is barely edible.  I always look forward to the tator tots and they always disappoint- taste like they were cooked in old oil.  Yuck!

The only positive is the cherry limeade or cherry limeades.  Oh, and the kids like to add chocolate to Dr. Pepper."}
{"text":"Got their current promo item claiming to be a Island fire cheeseburger. The burger boasts spicy habanero sauce which actually fell very short of anything spicy. The redeeming factor is always their drinks but it's hard to get that wrong."}
{"text":"Sonic and I had quite the love affair during my college years...oh those late night cravings! Every now and then I still need to get my chicken popper and shake fix...and they have yet to let me down. Although it has been years...where did the peanut butter chocolate shake option go?!!

There aren't too many Sonics in Charlotte (I'm used to a lot coming from Texas). While few and far between, this location is conveniently located off I-77. 

This one gives you plenty of dining options...drive-thru (although you still wait in your car and they still bring out your order), the pull-up and order slot (you can use your plastic here), and the dine-in or patio option."}
{"text":"First it took 5 minutes for my order to be taken which was a single drink. I get to the window and they take my money and they make me wait another 10 minutes for a single drink. The poor people behind me had to wait that entire time before their orders were even taken. Im surprised they didnt leave."}
{"text":"Love my sonic and team... Love the progress they're making now as well!The new boards are more convenient way to see what's going on. An the new crew members have given the atmosphere a great upgrade!"}
{"text":"Great managing service! Miriam helped us acquired the ultimate sonic experience, with timely matter and efficiency! I would definitely be coming here more than McDonalds!! WATCH OUT OTHER SONICS YOU HAVE OTHER COMPETITIONS !!!"}
{"text":"Even though this sonic is the closet one to my house, I would prefer to make the trip to another one. Milkshakes are runny and they always seem to forget something on my order."}
{"text":"My wife in hospital up the street. Stopped for breakfast burrito and a cup of coffee. Never knew food could taste so bad along with the coffee. Threw it in the trash and went elsewhere. 
Worst place I've ever stopped for breakfast in my life."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast while my wife was in the hospital. Worst breakfast burrito and coffee I've ever had. Threw it in the trash and left. Horrible."}
{"text":"Sucks!!!! Paid for sauce to go on my chicken sandwich (they asked if I still wanted the mayo as well and I said yes) received my chicken sandwich DRY, no mayo and no sauce I paid extra for. Pushed the button and told the girl, no one EVER came. Thanks for the dry crappy SAD-wich"}
{"text":"3.5 STARS but will bump them up .5 star because I don't have a lot of Sonic's near my homebase in SF Bay Area.  From the Yelp listings, I saw that Vegas is lucky to have a LOT of Sonic locations.  When I dropped by this one, I thought this was the only one in the whole city...oops, guess I was wrong.

My MO whenever I go into Sonic is to stick with things I know.  #1 on that list is the limeade.  Everything else I have had gotten mixed results.  Today, I tried the Chicago dog and the tots with a limeade.  The dog was OK, the bun fell apart later when the relish and pickle started to make it mushy.  The tots surprisingly were very good and not undercooked or overcooked.  

And of course, the carhop workers who had to deal with some pretty nasty wind conditions out there so I sympathized a little bit.  I tipped mine a few bucks.

Still love the limeade!"}
{"text":"Always have to go to sonic when in Arizona! The food is very cheap and good,however my favorite thing on the menu would have to be the fresh banana shake."}
{"text":"We really like Sonic, we come to this location all the time. But tonight, Samantha took our order and was extremely rude and impatient. The mic kept cutting out so we couldn't hear her well and she seemingly got very frustrated at us. If we didn't respond in .5 seconds she got upset and yelled \"HELLO!!?!?!?\" And when she brought our food she basically just handed the food and left, didn't give us a chance to say a word as we were going to politely ask for more ranch ( seeing as she gave us NO chance at all to ask for sauce over the mic).   We will still come here, but we pray we will never get her again. Avoid her at all costs"}
{"text":"So it has been a while before i decided  to come back here but my coworkers and i were hungry and the half off summer milk shakes is just a satisfying treat. I still come here late at night due to my work schedule but it seems they hired new people which have been great. 

i still don't order the popcorn chicken late at night just because I don't want to get the bottom of the bag crumbs like I did in my first review, but the pretzels dogs are delicious and they don't overdue the mustard.

So i'm upping this sonic to a 4 star."}
{"text":"Love the drinks (cherry limeades) at this place, but their help is AWFUL!!!! I've experienced horrible service from this place on several previous visits, and today was no different. On numerous signs at this location it promotes \"Happy Hour 2:00-5:00 pm-1/2 price all drinks!\". My husband and I have gotten this deal numerous times in the past so, with it being 4:15 pm, thought I'd stop on my way home and get a couple limeades. I pull in the drive-thru, place my order, and when the amount totaled the drinks at REGULAR price, I asked the employee at the window \"Shouldn't the drinks be half off?\" She gave me a blank stare and replied \"no\". I then asked her if its happy hour, and she replied \"We stopped doing that\". Surprised by this and knowing they were advertising 1/2 price drinks for 2:00-5:00 happy hour, I asked her to double-check. She came back a few moments later \"Happy hour only goes til 4:00\". Disgusted with the service, lack of apology, and her lying to me about discontinuing happy hour, I said I changed my mind about the drinks. Thinking I was going crazy for just seeing the Happy Hour advertised from 2:00-5:00 pm, I double-checked the board by the drive-thru. Sure enough, Happy Hour was clearly stated from 2:00-5:00, and I was right about my drinks being rung up wrong. And also, what happened to the customer always being right? I think the Happy Hour specials are something employees should know. I love this place's limeades but their service has been horrendous every time I have visited. They really need to hire better help."}
{"text":"As the stepping stone between fast food restaurants and drive throughs, drive-in diners are undoubtedly iconic of the early 1920s where people drove up in their cars, parked in little mini stations, ordered food from a menu, and had their items delivered by waitresses on roller blades. Fun, quirky, and super rare, I was more than excited to try out Sonic, one of the few (if not only) restaurants that still utilize this neat system.

The menu itself is quite extensive, offering what you would normally expect from a fast food restaurant except there are a ton of options for drinks that include lemonades, teas, sodas, and milkshakes. Entrees are typical like burgers, hot dogs, and chicken sandwiches. 

Because this isn't the 1900s, it did feel a bit strange to eat in your car and not as fun as I thought it would be. It was just normal, I suppose. Food was brought out in a measly paper bag and that was about it--just like any normal fast food order. While the waitress wasn't wearing a cool uniform by any means, I did enjoy seeing her roller blade out. Other than that though, it was a pretty underwhelming experience over all. 

And on top of the disappointing dining atmosphere, the food was absolutely abysmal. I got the grilled chicken sandwich on a ciabatta bun with Caeser dressing and a side of tater tots as well as a sweet iced tea. The sandwich was decently sized and while the vegetables were fresh, the chicken was strangely stringy around the edges and the cheese was disgustingly oily and greasy. I could barely finish a third of my sandwich before my stomach started to roll from all the grease, forcing me to forgo the rest. The tater tots, while crispy, were vastly under-seasoned, and the sweet tea itself tasted like sugar water. Where was the tea?

Sonic is most certainly cheap and the whole drive-in diner is a super cool concept. But since this is the 21st century, perhaps eating in your car isn't really that amazing and with food so mediocre, what makes Sonic stand out from the HUNDREDS of fast food restaurants around?

Positively nothing."}
{"text":"Really tired of getting wrong orders  really not that hard to read a receipt! Constantly getting tots when I ask for fries, or getting all the wrong drinks? For the amount of time it takes to even get the food out, the orders should be correct!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the service. Every time I've gone there, Jonah has been the one to help me and he goes above and beyond. He even goes back to get my fur baby a dog treat every time. My food always comes fast. But I'm a little frustrated after tonight's visit. I've always been iffy to try their deluxe burger and add jalapeños on it for 60 cents extra, but tonight I did it and I'm annoyed.... I got one TINY jalapeño in the corner of my bread and one TINY pickle across from it. Normally I'm not one to complain about something like that but I paid extra for it for no reason."}
{"text":"The absolute worst costumer service that can possibly exist!! My wife and I have been to the Mayfield Heights Sonic a total of approximately 7-8 times, scattered over a span exceeding a year since moving from New Mexico, and every time the service has been beyond substandard!

 We were regular customers at the Albuquerque area Sonic restaurants and we never really had issues with service until moving to the Heights area. Every single time the service at the Mayfield Heights Sonic has been painfully slow, poorly prepared food and have messed/mixed up on the order without fail!! We have been thoroughly perplexed on how they can mess up even the simplest order. We tried to give them the benefit of the doubt with respect to maybe they employed new staff or management and thought surely they have to get better, but on the final trip have concluded that they are just God awful in every aspect and there is no hope! 

The last time I was there to get a duplicate order prepared for free due to the fact they had messed up the order on the previous day and they promptly messed up that order as well!! On that final trip I noticed safety violations, employees stepping over things scattered about on the floor and just complete disorganization. I had directed the manager on duty to have the district manager contact me since the restaurant manager refused to provide me the number, but not surprisingly, I haven't heard back. To us this place ceases to exist. I would stay away if one values good customer service and sanity."}
{"text":"Wrong order. Long wait. Incompetent staff. Dumb kids on fruit boots cruising around the parking lot with change Machine fanny packs hoping for a tip. Stay in school. This place is awful"}
{"text":"Nice and new location. I went to the one on central for many years, but the area has gone down hill and the Sonic is in need of a serious face lift.  This is my first time here and it's a nice location. There is a park to the side of it with grass and manicured trees. Service was good and my food arrived quick. This will be my families new Sonic spot even if it is a further drive."}
{"text":"Terrible every single time I go, ordered a green tea with mango flavor and I'm pretty sure it's just water with a little bit of mango. DO NOT GO HERE"}
{"text":"I came back and changed my rating from a 4 (the first week or two that they opened) to a 1 (fast forward a month). They have a bunch of kids working there that do not care what type of food they serve. We got burgers that were cold with rock hard buns and dry meat. As you can see in the pictures the cheese wasn't even melted. When I took them back the manager said \"It's not supposed to be like that.\" YOU THINK. He did make it right, but this isn't the first time this has happened. I really wanted to like this location."}
{"text":"Great stop  for a quickie lunch... Love the Cherry Lime-aid and the  Chocolate with Bacon shakes are AWESOME 
The Chicago dog is okay not the best I've had but I won't choke on it either.."}
{"text":"Typical fastfood quality. Now I remember why I don't go here. Chicken in the chicken sandwich was falling off in between the bread. Lettuce was all over the bag. Save your money, head down Pecos and checkout Parsley's for a good, quality lunch."}
{"text":"We sat for literally 25 minutes at the car hop with zero answer from anyone. We tried to get one guys attention and he ignored us. 
We pushed the red button 5 times and were ignored once again. Finally someone did answer and mumbled something about being closed and hung up on us (it was 8:30pm) If you don't want to actually order food totally go there. You won't be disappointed! 
I will never be back. I'll be calling corporate. Ridiculous"}

Guess I will have to eat else where"}
{"text":"Pushed the button, waited, waited. Pushed the button again, waited, waited, psycho-pushed the button, waited waited. Finally server comes out to take care of the car that came in with me. I asked her if the consul was broken, she assured me it functioned. Which means the workers CHOSE to ignore me as I had eye contact with them many times. I've been to this Sonic many times and my experiences have been almost always dis-satisfactory when it comes to customer services - it's like they are lazy or do not care. Too bad, I would frequent Sonic more often except for the pitiful customer service at this particular Sonic. Since I've noticed to poor customer service over time and know the turn-over is rather rapid I have to assume the issue is with either management or ownership. I'll wait until I see better reviews on this store on Yelp before I CHOOSE to return to a Sonic."}
{"text":"After lunch, I decided I needed to get the taste of salad out of my mouth, and what better way to do that than with a milkshake?  Yes ma'am!  I thought there was a Sonic near where I had lunch, but wasn't quite sure where - thanks, Yelp app.  Located on Arrowood just off of the 77 exits, the drive-thru line was kind of long when I pulled up, but quickly moved along.  Instead of a drive-thru window to pick up your food, they have employees running in and out with your food on trays.  Again I thought that would be slow, but the folks were moving pretty darn quickly.  If you pay with a card, they will have to go back inside to scan it, but even that was a pretty quick process.  The youngster who brought my milkshake to me was smiling and quite friendly.

My small shake was $2.69 and I was on my way relatively quickly.  It was creamy and thick, with a good dose of whipped cream and a cherry on top.  I don't know that I would eat lunch there (they have drive-in service as well as some indoor seating), but if I needed another milkshake, I wouldn't hesitate to stop by for friendly service."}
{"text":"Yum. Great cherry limeade and banana shake. Tater tots were super hot, which I love. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I give them two stars because every time I came I actually left with food and that food was passable but the service is confusing,  they are bad at taking orders,  they have an odd setup for the drive-thru  and on more than one occasion tried to give me the wrong food,  on two other occasions they had to re make the food I ordered because they gave it to another car. The last 4 times I asked for ketchup and received none,  today I mentioned this and they gave me 15 packets.  I can only use 3 on a thing of tots and 15 packets now does not make up for ketchup-less tots of last week."}
{"text":"Great food ofcourse but this location has terrible service, they are unorganized and do not know about their own product.
It's great that it is open 24hrs nd that it's directly across from Palms Place"}
{"text":"This Sonic had good food (for a Sonic) but service was very slow.

Be advised that they use fake whipped cream as a topping on their shakes and (presumably) ice cream."}
{"text":"1/2 price shakes after 8pm real fruit slushes are awesome!! Quick service hamburgers look good!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Hawaii, so I haven't been to Sonic in over 5 years.  The service alone was exceptional! We went close to midnight and our order was out in less than 5 mins. Service was great, food was good,  milkshakes were very very good!"}
{"text":"I visited Sonic while on my lunch break a few minutes ago. I ordered an Asiago Chicken Club Sandwich. The sandwich was hard and old. I would have waited if they would have asked but they never gave me the option, they just gave me an old and hard sandwich. I won't return to this location again. I understand they were busy but its not about getting the food to the customer as quick as possible, its about serving quality food that the customer can chew coupled with efficiency. You take an L from me Sonic."}
{"text":"I doubt anyone will read this, but I feel compelled to say that this is the perfect place to go if you have absolutely nowhere to go. The service here, in the afternoons no less, is consistently slow. As fun as unpredictability can be, I don't feel like playing Russian roulette drive thru because the waits here make you want to blow your brains out. One time I pulled in and ordered an iced tea. Just a typical, unsweetened, no lemon iced tea. IT TOOK 13 MINUTES!! I feel like if there's ever a time you could go into a kitchen and learn how to do fix your order and then come out in less time than it took for you to get an order, there's a problem. The only thing I'm unsure of is if its just the employees who are slow or if the inside of the kitchen is actually another dimension in which time slows down and thus making orders coming out of the kitchen take three times as long as any other Sonic takes."}
{"text":"Has got to be one of the worse run Sonics in the history of Sonics.  They get one star for their solid diet cherry limeade as usual but being held captive in the drive through line for the past 20 minutes was just too much. Actually I'm pretty sure if the powers to be knew how they were running their drive through you'd yank their franchise rights immediately.  Maybe it's time for a spot check."}
{"text":"Found a long dark hair in my cherry limeade when i went to empty the limes and cherries in my sink. I emailed corporate with no response. How can you not see that while making the drink! Never returning."}
{"text":"It's sonic. The food is mediocre. I prefer to get my burgers elsewhere, but dang, am I addicted to their 1/2 off shakes after 8PM. They are a 2 minute drive out the gate of my community so you can guarantee to see me there once (if not twice) a week. My favorite is the peanut butter fudge. I have been obsessing over serendipity's peanut butter frozen hot chocolate, but that place is so far, and I can buy 6 of these for the price of one of those. Given, the frozen hot chocolate is different, and better quality, but we're talking every day fast food eats here. 

Once, I told my husband to \"surprise me\" with my shake flavor. That is a no go ladies. Don't do it. He promised me something chocolately and delicious, he ended buying me strawberry banana (thumbs down). The oreo cheesecake is decadent and delicious and we've also tried the banana cream pie. Seriously though, husbands, if your wife is going to splurge the calories of drinking a shake, the calories for a \"fruity\" flavor vs. a decadent one will be similar. Choose the decadent ones, it will make her happier. Therefore, I like sonic for making me fat & filling my dessert niche."}
{"text":"The manager Lanee is a C U Next Tuesday!!!  I went there ate at the car hop after we were done we went thru the drive thru to order more food before heading back to the house.  They seemed to be overwhelmed at this time which was odd cause there was only about 4 cars in line.  They messed up our order and then we asked for a refill (which the carhop mentioned that refills were 1/2 off) Lanee The Manager said with major attitude I'll get you another cup.  (meanwhile I have my card in my hand to pay for the refill) Lanee comes back with more attitude stating that WE DON'T DO REFILLS.  I said oh the carhop hop told us that you do and that they're 1/2 price. Lanee then says well next time you're going to have to pay for it.  I let her know that I had my card in my hand to pay you then Lanee says WELL IM SORRY AND SIGHS REALLT LOUD!!!  I asked are you the manager since she was wearing a purple shirt.  She said yes!  I asked her name she told me Lanee!  Then I said I will let corporate know about your attitude.  As I drive away she's YELLS WE ARE NOT CORPORATE BITCH!  She's lucky I did not stop my car and come back for her.  Instead I will be sure to let everyone know about her childish ways and when she loses her job we'll see whose A Bitch now!  But seriously this is the type of people you have running your establishment???  I will never go there again"}
{"text":"These guys suck they messed up my order I was told that they refunded my account and it's been almost a month and they still haven't refunded my $20.  Everytime I contact them it's always a story of it's the banks I called my bank and showed them the receipt where it shows that they refunded the check and my bank advised me that there was never a refund issued.  Then they're like come down to see me and I will give you cash but the manager is never there and always says I will let you know my schedule and never does.  Shady business practices. If I do not get my refund I will file report with BBB.  I would've gave them zero stars but they got 1 by default"}
{"text":"Love it - love their happy hour - the limeades are awesome and the sweet potato and potato tots wonderful!"}
{"text":"Awful! Loved it when I lived in Oxford, MS. but this one in Mayfield Heights, OH. I would say avoid. It does not matter if they are newly opened or not their staff needs to have an actual clue what they're doing and based on my experience today they clearly do not. The tots were not hot nor were they crispy. And Sonic is known for their AWESOME tots while these were so below par it was pathetic. The burger when I finally got it (do to some strange confusion where I was rung up for a combo, but then the cashier thought I didn't want the burger so when I sat down all I had in my bag were those sad tots) was just okay and again based on my previous experiences (all good) with the Sonic in MS. the burger was really not up to Sonic standards. Sonic is not a small operation so one has to wonder why they don't have a better management team to come in and train the employees so there are not so many issues when they open. Reading the other reviews on this site it is pretty obvious my awful experience is not an isolated one. I was so excited when I heard a Sonic was opening closeby and i have to say now that I've actually been there what a terrible letdown it was."}
{"text":"This is the worst sonic I have ever been to. The woman who took our order was rude and really seemed like she wasn't paying attention. The shakes we ordered had a clump of what was supposed to mixed in. Definitely last time coming here"}
{"text":"It's a Sonic.

They do everything right, food always comes out warm and fresh, and the carhops are always nice and courteous.

The location is always clean and well picked up, and perhaps most importantly, this sonic never seems to be too busy, so it's never a hassle to find a spot or to go through the drive thru."}
{"text":"Okay, I KNOW I'm writing a review for a fast food place but COME ON, it's Sonic. First of all, it's right across from Palms and open 24 hours. Dangerous and amazing. Secondly, their drinks are perfect for mixing in alcohol because they're essentially just club soda and syrup. My personal favorite is diet cherry limeade with vodka. Get the Route 66 size, add some vodka, get some tater tots and do it Vegas style, my friends."}
{"text":"This just wasn't good food.  I ordered a single cheeseburger with just ketchup and cheese.  They brought out a burger loaded with toppings.  They replaced it quickly, but the bun was dry and crumbly, and the burger just didn't taste very good at all.  Even the tots were not great.  I might choose them above McDonald's (I can't stand the smell or taste of their food), but if there was ANYTHING else available, I'd never eat Sonic again.  It's edible - but why do that to yourself if there are other choices out there?"}
{"text":"My husband and I, with seven of our nieces and nephews, went here to grab some slushies during Happy Hour from 2-5 PM. We went at about 4 PM on Saturday and it wasn't very packed. We were able to order and pay outside with our card. Lots of seeing available, and it was about as clean as it could be for an outdoor dining area. 

We accidentally ordered a few of our drinks wrong and our server was kind enough to replace them for us. 

We did end up spending over $40 there, because the kids got hungry. We ordered perfectly fried fries, surprisingly tasty chicken sandwiches, and some burgers. I would go to this location anytime, I highly recommended it. Thanks for the great service."}
{"text":"Yuuuum! I will always prefer this over McDonald's next door. I usually only order from the dollar menu and only a few times has my burger been made kind of sucky. The fries are hit & miss tho. USUALLY their on the softer side.. I like when their kind of crispy on the outside. BUT ITS OKAY. If you utilize Happy Hour & Value/Dollar menu, you get can a drink, sandwich, & fry for under $3. 

Oh, I don't think I need to write about the drinks. They're bomb.com. You have so much to choose from depending on your taste. Lemon-Berry slushie is like the go to slushie if you really can't decide. I like the cherry flavor too. I usually get a Raspberry Sweet (Iced) Tea, I literally cannot even explain how delicious this drink is. 

Their iced coffee is good too. Really sweet. But too expensive for my liking.

I almost always go in the drive-in too.. It's the only drive-in fast food place I've been at for over 10 years."}
{"text":"Fast food is extremely rare for me, but I was so hungry and got lunch here since it's only a few blocks away from where I work.
Their burgers never fail to disappoint. It's been a while since I've been to a Sonic so it really hit the spot! Their milkshakes here are good too."}
{"text":"always love a little sonic and a little goes a long way. I was excited to find this location while visiting the area. Chili cheese coney, cheese tots and a pineapple milkshake or a corn dog and cheese tots and shake are my usual."}
{"text":"Prices are cheap....food is good. Happy hour 2-5pm drinks like sodas, lemonades, slushies are HALF OFF!!! 

But best of all....CHILI CHEESE TOTS WITH ONIONS!!!!! Oh. My. Goodness. I'm salivating as I type this. Now those things are my weakness. That, alone, is worth my five stars."}
{"text":"The food at all sonics is meh at best.   The happy hour drinks are good. Cherry limeade s good, especially half off.  Now, if they added rum to it, I'd be here everyday"}
{"text":"Really?  What the hell is the attraction to this place.  I was super hungry and it didn't make the food any better.  I think they spend all their budget on stupid tv spots.  The fries were semi-limp and not seasoned at all.  The chili-dog was terrible."}
{"text":"Been frequenting the sonic for nine years now, for the first time today, they messed up my order. Not only did they catch it before it made it into my car, but they came out with the correct order Amber seated to give me a free drink! That's great service."}
{"text":"We had a craving for Sonic tonight.  So when we got there I went to order my usual with extreme tots and they told me that they no longer could make them anymore.  This should of been a sign to leave and order food from somewhere else.  We ended up ordering about 40.00 in food.  When my Wife got her Strawberry Daiquiri it had a taste of coconut in it and was kinda gross, the chili cheese tots where soggy and cold.  I nor my wife won't be returning to this location.  Kinda sucks cause Sonic was one of our go to places.  Thanks for ruining it for us Sonic."}
{"text":"Usually like sonic they got new staff third time they didn't get my order right. I asked for no mayo and no lettuce looks like they put extra lettuce. The service use to be fast and now it takes thirty minutes plus Everytime."}
{"text":"Wanted a late night treat with my four friends. Instead we all got stomach pain after are blasts."}
{"text":"I have dined at this establishment 4 times in the hopes of one time getting the experience that I have always read about, a solid combination of old fashioned service, delicious tater tots and unique beverages, and the fun niche of being served by a young lad on roller skates. Unfortunately, the reality of Sonic is a far cry from what is represented by the company in both written and visual advertising. 

Let's start with the service. The \"quick serve\" drive thru lane consistently has a faulty speaker system that makes it extremely difficult to place an order without having to repeat it several times. When I asked a question concerning its expansive menu, I would often receive a dead silent reply and no answers forthcoming. Add this to to the consistently long wait time for the food, and it leads to extremely high expectations to justify the wait. Unfortunately, this justification is also in vain. 

The food quality has been extremely disappointing on all visits. Though I can say that the pretzel dogs are a shining light, the tater tots are consistently mushed together and served well below what I would consider to be an adequate temperature. 

The value just isn't there either. I have no problem paying a premium for higher and fast food (like In N Out, for example) but Sonic just doesn't deliver on this aspect either. 

Overall, I am extremely disappointed  with both the food quality and service at this local Sonic and I simply cannot recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"TRAPPED!! Slowest service ever. After sitting in the so called \"drive thru\" line for 25 minutes, I had time to download Yelp, register for an account, and write this review. I still haven't ordered, and there is no escape from this drive through as the concrete sidewalk goes all the way around.

I have no idea if the food is good because it seems as if we will never get to order. I could have enjoyed a meal at a sit down restaurant in the time I have spent in this line. I won't be getting in this line again."}
{"text":"Sizes got smaller but the quality of the food is still great. Little bit pricey but I would recommend this place for fast food items. I had tatter tots, m&m sonic blast and French toast sticks. Never a disappointment when I come to this place."}
{"text":"It was our first time ever trying a sonic drive-in and we didn't know that fast food could be so slow! We waited almost 10 minutes or more? I guess they were making our food fresh. 

We ordered the Chicken club toaster sandwich - It was good! It tasted just like the ones you get at a good diner. It tasted like they made it to order and the chicken was crispy and hot. 

The fries were good, we liked dipping them into bbq sauce and the ranch sauce. 

I would definitely order that chicken sandwich again! Hopefully it won't take too long next time."}
{"text":"I guess the reason why this food would even \"hit the spot\" is 1-because you are on a budget or 2-you just got drunk and the Palms! :) I understand both! After gambling away money that we probably shouldn't have, we were buzzed and looking for somewhere to go after the Palms. Look no further! Just across the street we saw Sonics! Careful not to be like us and almost cut through the divider! You have to make a U-turn! Oopz! Anyways, the greasy corn dog and tater tots hit the spot! No frills, no human interaction, just order your food ok the screen and wait for the guy in roller blades to deliver! :)"}
{"text":"This sonic was a complete disappointment. The guy taking our order could not repeat anything back to us correctly. We ordered the #10 (Crispy Asiago Caesar Chicken Club Sandwich meal) with a large cherry coke and another Crispy Asiago Caesar Chicken Club Sandwich with no tomato. We received two classic crispy chicken sandwiches and a large cherry coke. How the heck do you screw that up so badly? Not to mention the sandwiches were so pathetic. Maybe I just need to cross Sonic of my list of places to stop for quick food. They'll make it quick, but it won't be what you ordered."}
{"text":"The girl that came out to our car was fast and nice as could be, however; all I ordered was a cherry limeade which taste like they just add a Cherry flavor syrup to Sprite. It wasn't good."}
{"text":"Holy crap. Worst service ever. Stopped in for a happy hour shake with my boyfriend and pressed the button. The guy told us the concrete wasnt part of the happy hour, totally cool but then he called my boyfriend \"pops\". He said drive thru was the only thing open, so we drove around. The lady was rushing us to place our order and then said they were out of Oreo when we did order. She became impatient with us so we left. Won't ever return to this location"}
{"text":"Don't ever order the Supersonic breakfast burrito unless you like a mouthful of raw white onions first thing in the morning.  What place makes a breakfast burrito without at least heating the veggies?  Disgusting.  Wasted money since I had to throw the entire thing away."}
{"text":"Not very happy with food or service I received today. They brought my food out and kept forgetting things to my order and when I asked where it was I got the ugh and eye roll cause they had to go get it. 
I finally have everything I ordered and I start munching on the tots that were refried to make warm and yet they tasted old, stale and cold. I also got a bacon cheeseburger and a couple bites in I got a nice piece of hair with my food. So needles to say I lost my appetite. I'm frustrated that I spent my hard earn money. I understand things happen but yuck"}
{"text":"Whenever I pick my girlfriend up from work around 2-3am it's always the same guy, nobody else but him and we're always in & out, 5 minutes tops. Never messed our drinks up, makes sure our sauces are tight. And he's friendly. Shout out for the jolly ranchers slushes."}
{"text":"I came by to just get a slush about 5 min before they close. yeah i get sometimes thats not always the best move but they were still open. well i try to get a slush and they said that they were closed. im like look man all i want is a slush and you guys dont close for another 5 min and the guy gave me some attitude about. really upset me. gave me a bad experience and it was pretty bad customer service."}
{"text":"We go here all the time but this might be the last. We went to the drive thru and ended up waiting 10 minutes when there was only one person in front of us and for the second time the drink tasted horrible. All it tastes like alka seltzer which I know I didn't order, I'm just warning you, I'm tired of this place messing up"}
{"text":"This Sonic is not to far from where I live. I haven't had any problems with the service or the food either. There isn't ever big line in the drive thru or a long wait on orders. The driver thru is a little tricky and you gotta make sure you don't hit the curbs while turning in it."}
{"text":"Yuck!  I swear I used to love the grilled cheese sandwhich and tater tots.  The food has just been disgusting the last 3 times I went.  I will NOT be going back.  The grilled cheese has hardly any cheese in it.  Texas toast with a butter smearing amount of cheese between the two slices.  The tater tots taste cold and stale like they have been sitting around for hours.  Ick."}
{"text":"Since they've changed their menu boards with the new digital touch screens, their service has also been vamped up. They've also changed their uniforms too. This is by far the fastest location that I've been to. 40 seconds for a double Reese's hot fudge shake. This location is part of why I come back."}
{"text":"I wen to the store to buy 5 chess burgers around 11 pm ! I got my entire meal late and cold!i call back the guy say to return the burgers to exchange almost mid night with my kids hungry they all ready finish the burger!!i he say to came back another day to get a new ones but thad never happen cause  the    Gm was not there I spend 45 min to give a not till the gm was there thad I have to came back on Friday to speak with him!!!that's so ridiculously please don't bother buying their is not personal capable to handle anything!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Rolled up to the drive through to get some ice and was denied. They politely informed me they were not selling bags of ice at this time. Total let down  but they were nice about it."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my boyfriend, a friend, and I to get slushees. After placing our orders, they came in a timely manner and the server was polite and kind. My boyfriend took a sip of his slush only to realize it was pretty much a liquid. Like, melted, not a slush at all. He went back up to the counter to get his order fixed, where the staff offered to make him a new one. The new slush, however, now had ice cream in it. The next one, was the wrong flavor. Only when the manager came out was the situation finally rectified. Even then, I wouldn't highly rate these slushes as they were extremely syrupy and gross, like cough syrup, not worth the price. I would honestly rather go to 7/11 and get a slush for 99 cents because I feel like the quality is better. I have been going to Sonic since I moved to Arizona 14 years ago and I have never had an experience this awful here. I am extremely disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Simply put, this location is understaffed (at all hours of the day) and under-managed!!

I have been to this location on several occasions to order breakfast. They advertise a breakfast burrito and a large drink for $3. They also advertise that this particular \"deal\" is guaranteed in under 2min or the \"next one is free\"! Yeah... okay!! They have failed to deliver on this customer promise each of the three times I have ordered it... and have over charged me each time (I guess it's too difficult for them to understand their own promotion). Nevertheless, I am documenting each visit and have attempted, on several occasions, to reach out to the district manager. The next step is to contact the better business department regarding the false advertisement (because it is blatantly occurring here).

I encourage you to visit this location and document your own experience. I hope it is better than mine."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Sonic the other day...strawberry banana milkshake was the best I've ever had...chicken fingers were way over cooked ..tater tots were good..tater tots....but the milkshake...YUM!! I will definitely go back..fresh bananas and strawberries in a shake...can't beat that"}
{"text":"This is my first time ever going to a Sonic. I tend to avoid fast food but this place was pretty good and it's open late with half price shakes after 8 (a clear win in my book). The service was a tad slow but the guy (server? Food deliverer?), Jeremy, was super nice and apologised and gave us extra ketchup. Jeremy really improved the experience and he should probably make more money because it seems like a pretty dismal place to work. Keep it up Jeremy (and Shayontay)!! ILY


Update: Jeremy waved goodbye while on his break. I miss him already."}
{"text":"Go during happy hour and get a great deal on drinks or food, half off. I recommend the strawberry frozen lime aid it's the best!"}
{"text":"Topical Sonic fast food I If you have kids they do have a cheap grilled cheese sandwich.If they grill it on both sides in butte,it taste good y it's one of the cheapest ways to get full for 2.99 they also have cheese burgers y hot dogs fries milkshakes y soda .They are pretty fast w service y you don't have to get out of the car.The rest of the menus is 6 7 y 8 dollars. So Xs how many people. Two ppl. Expect to spend $26.00 for lunch.  That's pretty much it. Has a button to place your order. Happy Holidays everybody."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to get to Vegas and try Sonic since I see constant commercials for the place but there aren't any in Los Angeles to go to... So 4am after leaving the palms and not sleeping for 27 hours we decided to navi Sonic (this is a sober review, I know, hard to believe at 4am in Vegas) Footlong Chili dog with unions and mustard on the side (we split it in half) fries, Chicago dog, ched r' poppers w/ ranch, fries, and tots, watermelon and cherry slushes, unsweet iced tea (food split 4 ways)

I'd come here many times over for a middle of the night chili dog and tots and the next time I come I'll try the chili cheese tots, these would be my tried and true and I wouldn't stray to far from them.... The fries weren't good to me I like my fries crispy on the outside and soft in the center these fell short, the poppers were okay just wouldn't waste my calories on them again, I don't drink soda and I'm a iced tea pro and sonic did me proud fresh brewed added my own sweetener and was on my way. The only thing that disappointed me was the slushes I had such high expectations and they fell short. They were just super sweet no depth nothing to write home about I've had better flavors at 7 eleven. 

Service was quick and friendly, very attentive for fast food... i'm not really a burger fast food fan other than In n Out but i'd come here whenever i was in vegas looking for 24hour grub

A"}
{"text":"I come in for slushes just about twice a week....I mean it's been 108 outside most of the sums me, don't judge me. Occasionally I will splurge and get cheese sticks or the poppers. Decent food I guess, I keep coming back. 4 stars because no matter if they are busy or not, be prepared to get the \"sorry for your wait\" at the drive thru. A little annoying but doesn't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"It's already been stated but I can concur this Sonic in Indian Trail is hurting badly.  I didn't realize just how bad it is until visiting the one in Concord which is all modernized.  The IT location is badly needing a total makeover.  The screens rarely work and the card readers don't work at all.  Our most recent visit had so many mistakes on the order we just handed it all back to them.  We will probably drive to another location next time."}
{"text":"I went there to get onion rings and a large mozzarella sticks, I home and saw in the bag, and everything was wrong. They have me a small fry  and small mozzarella. And charged me for the mediums I ordered. Not worth driving back the 15 minutes to get there. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great to have a place open 24 hours.. Especially a sonic. Food was hot and fresh.. Would be a 5 star review but my vanilla bean milkshake tasted like cake batter to me!"}
{"text":"Is there a more perfect quick meal than a grilled cheese, cherry limeade and tater tots? All for less than $5? 

I think not!"}
{"text":"I learned many years ago that Sonic servers worked for tips like waiters do in any other restaurant.  So I try not to come here if I don't have cash for their tips. 

It's been years since I've been here so my review is only based on today's visit.  Three cars were parked when we arrived.  Drive-thru was a lot faster than Drive-IN. No issues with speaker/mic.  Server was very polite but brought us another car's order at first.  They honored 50% off text promo from Sonic.  Ordered five Sonic blasts, different flavors.  I thought it had more ice cream than a balance of ice-cream and add-in... Snickers, Oreo, Reeses, M&Ms, etc. but everyone enjoyed them and were very pleased.  

I'd recommend it to anyone but I would suggest ordering in the Drive-thru line instead."}
{"text":"The customer service at this Sonic is HORRIBLE!!!   I just went there tonight and above each of their parking slots and above their to go menu board are the signs that say \"1/2 price shakes after 8 pm\" and when I went to order 4 shakes for me and my co-workers I was told that they \"Don't do this anymore, it was just a summer promotion.\"  Today is August 31st, we are in Arizona, it IS still summer!!!!  They would not honor their own advertisements!!!!  I mentioned that the signs were still up and the girl said it didn't matter that they will not honor it.  See if I go back to this Sonic ever again."}
{"text":"Unapologetically slow, but at least it seems clean. Pretty consistently over the last few years I've been coming here."}
{"text":"Loving that vanilla ice cream with a waffle cone ! Sonic has the best ice cream. Better then nasty DQ"}
{"text":"S O N I C is my favorite drive thru dessert spot. I'm a big fan of the vanilla waffle cone, yum !"}
{"text":"My coney hot dog had no chili and are fries had old ass grease that's why I hate eating around here please improve your sonic"}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a quick slushy. Only two cars were there.  I hit the button and waited. After a few minutes no one answered so I pushed the button again.  Waited a few more minutes and still nothing. After about 10 minutes of waiting and seeing a girl take food to another car I hit the button over and over until someone answered. Finally...I placed my order and paid at the screen.  The slush came out quickly but it should never take over ten minutes at a fast food place when no one is there. I think I'll find a different location next time."}
{"text":"Drive through woman had an attitude in her tone of voice after I said we have coupons. I proceeded to place my order and she repeated back to me an incorrect order. I retold her my order and she then repeated it back with a bigger attitude. This happened about 4 times. Then I pulled up to the drive through and asked to speak to a manager. The older female manager also had an attitude and then mocked how I said the word tone. Very unpleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Only ordered drinks but service was fast.  Didn't wait long and rep was very polite and double checked our order.  They weren't busy.   Everything looked clean and all stations seemed to be working."}
{"text":"This is the second worst Sonic Drive-In in the US. We came here on Sunday around noon for breakfast/lunch. The girl taking our order must have been distracted because she asked me to repeat 3 out of 4 of the meals+drinks I ordered.  You would think that they would have a good chance of getting the entire order correct, but that is an incorrect assumption.  One of the drinks came out with the wrong size AND flavor. Also, one of the items I ordered (family sized tots) was completely missing from the order. The card swiper gave me an error when running my card but then acted as though it might be processing with a \"PLEASE WAIT\" message for two minutes but then no final indication of whether the charge went through or not. The girl delivering the order had to take my card inside to complete the payment so now I will need to keep an eye on my statement to make sure I don't get double charged. I am giving it two stars only because the food was decent and this location is slightly better than THE WORST Sonic location at Elliot and Kyrene."}
{"text":"This is the best Sonic we've been to. Stopped in on our way out of town; we got breakfast items, lunch items, and drinks. The tots and fries were super fresh and hot, as well as the rest of the food. Even the drinks were made better than any other Sonic. The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I got their corn dog and it sucked. It wasn't even crispy! Their only saving grace is their variety of shakes and drinks. The chocolate milk shake was great!"}
{"text":"I used to come here everyday for lunch for a drink- a strawberry limeade or cherry Dr. Pepper. But the last few months they have gotten my order wrong. I used to get my drinks slushed and when I asked them they looked at me as if I had grown two heads. I then got told we don't do it slushed anymore....I mean am I in the right place?? Is this sonic? I gave up, nothing is more frustrating than getting an order wrong and having to turn back around when in the drive thru and explaining it to them. And when I have, my drinks get \"messed with\" meaning they've added other flavors in. Forget this place, I'll go to another one instead."}
{"text":"Why, one wonders? Why would a Sonic have bad reviews?  
Well I ordered a small vanilla milkshake  $2.99 for my daughter,  was charged $3.39 for an oreo milkshake. Informed the gal, it was not vanilla.  She took it back, brought a vanilla one. 
It's bad enough that this business charges for ice water, now 40 cent overcharge for an incorrect item. It might seem trivial but if even 1 out of 50 customers is over charged, they are raking in serious money. Will have to find another milkshake spot."}
{"text":"A year ago, this place was AMAZING. Now, a year later :( not so much. Ordered a #1 with no lettuce and no onion.  Got a soggy cold bun with lettuce and a piece of cold cheese.  Plus neither beverage had the lid on all the way. Thankfully it is 1030pm, and on my way to my mums...otherwise I would be furious having blue colored sprite all over me. Doubtful I will return to this location, based on the down slide."}
{"text":"New Flat melt is just to grease. I didn't even open up the wrap and it was grease all over my shirt. I'm pissed. I come here for traveling food. This place is the same from the east coast to west coast. This location I found just didn't meet the Sonic standard."}
{"text":"Ocean Water and Banana Milkshake are the only items I actually like. I've tried their burgers before but I prefer In-N-Out. I've been here a few times where I can say the service is okay nothing memorable. It's just a fast food joint."}
{"text":"got a wacky pack meal with tots and a grilled cheese, small sprite...got to the window and he said small cheese tots right? I said no...just regular kids tots he said oh, okay. I asked for a ranch and he handed me two literally dripping in ranch, so gross. reach in to eat a tot on the way home and they're cheese tots. I called and smoke to the manager who apologized and offered to replace or give credit but I just don't trust food once you've complained. Very disappointed since I've been several times for the same order with no problem. He also handed me everything and then asked for the reveipt back to ring me up and acted as if I were moving too slowly. Won't be back to this location. Check your food before you leave this guy doesn't care."}
{"text":"Stopped by during their happy hour, slushes and shakes are half off, can't beat the price. Ordered one route 44 strawberry slushy and two small strawberry slushes paid less then $5."}
{"text":"Can you ever go wrong with tator tots or cherry limeade?? I think not! The burgers are alright but I prefer in and out for those. So I stick with tots and limeade here ;)"}
{"text":"Received horrible costumer service, my order was taken wrong and apart from that the correct item that was given was a JOKE. The wait was 30+ minutes to receive attitude and half-ass food! Pictures are attached, worst $20 iv spent in along time could have traveled down the road further and gotten better food service and price at in-and-out! At least talk to your employees, if they hate their job they shouldn't take it out on PAYING costumers, WE WILL NOT BE BACK."}
{"text":"Just the fact that these guys are open 24 hours is already a plus in my book. You can order anything on their menu whether its a breakfast burrito, hot dog, or hamburger. I mean, isnt that how EVERY restaurant that's open 24/7 should be? 

Most people come for the specials they have. The most common one is happy hour which is from 2 to 5 pm. Half price for all slush drinks! At the time of this review, they were having half price milkshakes from 8 pm to midnight. I think that's perfect especially if you ate dinner somewhere else and decided that a half priced milkshake would be good for dessert! 

Their burgers are average. The hot dogs are what I think actually taste better and there are more choices than their burgers. Go figure. The side items are more attractive than the main courses. I tried the onion rings, cheddar peppers and chili cheese tots! Loved it!

When you pull up to a Sonic location, you can either park at a station and eat what you order in your car, go to the drive thru, or park and sit at any one of the tables they have available. Where you sit is also where you order. 

The only thing that really annoys me is that the machine that takes your cards to pay does not seem to work more than half the time. So you would have to hand your card over to your server when they come out with the food. They would have to make an extra trip back to their main place to swipe your card, wait for the receipt, and then go back to your location to give you your card back. Lame.

For mor info like their complete menu, go to their website: www.sonicdrivein.com"}
{"text":"It's a Five STAR all the way and that is just for the Cherry Limeade!!!!

Although...I could deduct a star for drive thru wait times and the clientele that frequent this establishment but hey....PERFECTION takes time and patience. 

I'm sure you could go on and on about sonics excellent burgers and sandwiches. Also...how they serve tater tots instead of fries as an option or have HOTDOGS on the menu but for me....I don't eat any of it...just the Cherry limeade and I'm a happy man!"}
{"text":"Edit: Several months later I needed ice and didn't want to get out of the car so I took a chance. I was greeted kindly so I've started going back. I'm not sure what caused the turn over but the employees are nice again however I've yet to order sweet tea 

I'm just not even coming here anymore. I'm not sure sure what happened to this place. The very polite employees seem to have all been replaced with rude ones. I don't want a red carpet but I don't want them screaming in my ear they can't hear me or becoming upset if we misunderstand each other and need to fix an order. I've continued to come thinking it would get better but if anything it's gotten worse. As a side note, if you don't have sweet tea don't tell me you do then dump sugar into cold tea thinking it's the same because it isn't and it's obvious as soon as I take a drink. Very disappointing because it was once a really decent place."}
{"text":"I had he worst experience. Of course drinks is one thing that sonic is known for. I order a 1.89 small Diet cherry limeade, but I guess they thought I didn't want ice. I had only three little bits of ice in my small drink. My husband ordered a cherry slush, but his was half watery, maybe the slush machine was leaking. I don't even know how my kids drinks were, but my drink was a sad drink. My husband believes that the carhop was mentally challenged. He thought this because when he finally rang up our order correctly, which took two minutes for four drinks, he came to our car with five drinks. As he hands me the four drinks, all of them had syrup all over the outside. Then when he was getting our change, he put his tray directly in our window to the point that I had to scoot over to the right so he wouldn't accidentally hit me. Let's say it would be forever till I ever consider coming back."}
{"text":"I love sonic and my kids love the half price shakes. So last night my daughter and o take an evening trip around the corner for some food and ice cream. The line was not that long but the wait time was. They were out of cookie dough as well as ranch. They didn't bother to offer an apology and was only told the ranch was out after we paid. The food was not fresh and the girls seemed not to care. I'll travel to DQ next time."}
{"text":"I was a fan on this place since I was 15 meaning 2007 i opened thus store and seen the busy business grow.This place is horrible at service!! Especially at late night 25 min for mozzarella cheese sticks? One night 45min for a Chilli cheese hot dog & fries?? I just don't get what happened management doesn't care after I left Calls and messages for the horrible service.  I've been a customer to sonic for years this location is shit literally.  I'll take my business somewhere else. Save your time and money and go somewhere where they actually appreciate your business. Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"If you're in a hurry don't stop here. Lady took 10 minutes to take a 5 item order. Clearly got the drink wrong on the screen and when I tried to correct her to tell her it wasn't the same thing she laughed and said \" it is the same I know what I'm doing!\" I said it's not but then she ended the session so I couldn't finish my order. Waiting another 5 minutes for our order and of course the drink was disgusting because it wasn't the right drink. I do not have 10 minutes to wait for an ignorant teenage to take my order wrong and slow and won't stand to be corrected. Couldn't even complain and get my drink changed because by that time I was late. Won't return to this sonic ever."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong when Sonic is having their happy hour. Highly recommend the strawberry frozen lime aid, especially on a warm Vegas afternoon."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong at Sonic! Ordered corn dogs this time and they were great, warm not burned. Plus their strawberry frozen lime aid is always on time."}
{"text":"Foods always cold. Employees act abused the managers don't seem to enforce anything. I feel obligated to tip these poor employees to make up for their substantial wages. Don't go to this sonic, out of the others I've been to its possible that there business plan works but this shop is a lost cause."}
{"text":"Went over our order multiple times, when we finally got the good and drinks, they were incorrect and had to be fixed. They were very nice about it, but how do you not understand getting it right when it is repeated so many times? Just wondering."}
{"text":"Never again had me waiting 45mins for some onion rings and a drink won't ever come here again  avoid this sonic for sure !!!!"}
{"text":"Boooooo. 
Ordinarily I would put up with waiting 15+ minutes in the drive thru and unfriendly service just because the unsweetened tea here was so good. However, when they still get my order wrong after I've repeated myself at least 5 times, I have to draw the line. 
Skip this one, it's worth driving an extra mile or so to visit another location."}
{"text":"Stood by menu board outside waiting to order for 10 minutes, even knocked on the window. They ignore everything but the drive thru here in the morning apparently. Oh well, they failed to get a fist full of money. We were a larger group of very hungry construction workers..."}
{"text":"This place is horrible they mess up your order every time. If you were to order a tea you would get a coke!! Really it's that bad!! I love sonic overpriced but I do like there food and drinks but this location is the worst ever!!! I stopped going for sometime hoping they would fix the staff came back first order and they messed that up to and overcharged me!! Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Service was okay, pretty slow. Typically I would be okay with slower service if food is hot but fries were cold. Ice cream was very good though."}
{"text":"Service was fast! Chicken however wasn't so good, not hot and kind of rubbery but not the worst I've had ha. Worth it for the timing, at least the tater tots were hot!"}
{"text":"I ordered a SS Dbl Bacon Cheeseburger.  When I got back to my office, I realized that they had given me a hot dog instead of my hamburger.  I had to go all the way back and when I told them of the problem, they said it would be at least 10-15 mins before they could fix the problem.  I asked for a refund and was told that it would take 48 hours to process the credit.  I will never be returning to Sonic again.  You can take my money in an instant and give me the wrong order, but it takes 2 days to issue a refund????  Unacceptable! 

Location is filthy.  Cigarette butts all over the parking lot, slow service and wrong orders.  It's not brain surgery, it's a hamburger."}
{"text":"As far as fast food or Sonic Drive-In goes, this is pretty much what it should be.  The kids love to order their food at the table.  The prices are cheap and it definitely tastes better than McDonalds or Burger King."}
{"text":"The kids the have working at this location don't give a shit about you or your food screw this place. One of them looked all tweeked out. No go!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from San Jose, CA.  For some reason, we would get the Sonic commercials (even though the nearest Sonic was at least an hour away). So I was pretty psyched to try this place out when I moved her 4 years ago.

The service is fast and friendly. The slushes are cold and the tots are hot.  What else could you ask for from a fast food joint?

This location (across the street from the Palms hotel) is open 24 hours.  

Happy hour from 2-4 PM (drinks/slushes 1/2 off) and shakes are buy one get one free all day.

The coneys are all right, the cheeseburgers are so-so; 9 times out of 10 I end up at Sonic for a drink or dessert.

My current favorite: the Campfire Blast (thick graham cracker soft serve swirled with chocolate covered marshmallows) and Strawberry Watermelon Slush"}
{"text":"I got to a lot of burger joints for a lot of different reasons and Sonic is almost at the top of my list, 2nd all time fav! They just have a nice, good burger, with a nice good, toasted bun, fresh veggies they will add/remove just about anything you ask. This location is clean, the drive-thru was quick/easy and I love the mint. You know that little mint in the bottom of my bag just makes it all worthwhile. Thank you Sonic!"}
{"text":"Always take forever to answer my carhop, frequently i have to change stalls bc it's been five minutes so i start to assume that the stall i'm in is broken. Today after waiting two minutes in my third stall someone answered me, and it took 10 minutes to get TWO slushees. Usually i don't mind but it's ridiculous today, three different stalls- 10 minute wait."}
{"text":"S O N I C !!! Went thru the drive thru and got some goodies for the family. Service tonight deserve 5 stars, very friendly, order was correct, didn't have to repeat myself while ordering."}
{"text":"This used to be my guilty pleasure once a week after physical therapy. They were located throughout the Chicago area and was excited to see one so close when we moved to Surprise Arizona. We frequent there for a couple years. But then all of a sudden our frequency came to a screeching halt once they discontinued the Chicago dog. What they do have good shakes and slushies and we still visit occasionally because who doesn't like tater tots."}
{"text":"Food was okay.. About 6 of us ordered and the bill came out $70.. First off the girl on roller blades who delivers out food comes up and says nothing is marked so we all have to dog thru each others food to see who's is who's.. When your spending that kind of money you would hope your food is atleast marked.. Then we ordered there icy drinks.. They were way to sweet and not icy enough.. I ordered the chicken sandwhich with tator tots! The sandwhich was okay.. And the tator tots were probably the best tator tots I've ever had.. But then we asked for a refill on our Ice teas before we left and it took 20 minutes after we were done eating to get our refill that never came.. We ended up leaving without one.. It wasn't the girls fault on roller blades they just didn't have enough staff and she obviously wasn't trained.. I personally would never go to another sonic ever again and I'm pretty sure the rest of the people I went with wouldn't go back either.. Some of the people who ordered the burgers and cheese burgers said they were okay but nobody wanted to finish there food of of the other 5 guys that were there.. And they were a lot more upset about the while outcome than I was."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since it first open mostly because I had gone to a different location and the food and service were good. I have been to this place several times and I can say that not one visit has been w/o problems. From getting the wrong food, to employees and managers with attitude, extended drive through periods of waiting, food just tasting old or cold, etc...I even submitted a complaint on their website  and NO ONE got back to me. My kids like the popcorn chicken and the shakes, otherwise I would have stop coming to this place a long time ago."}
{"text":"I get out of work at 10 pm so I don't have a lot of choices to get fast food when I don't feel like making dinner at home. When I choose sonic I have to remind myself that there will be absolutely no tea left. I thought the place closes at 12 so it's pretty pathetic when they run out of that. I order popcorn chicken and I end up getting almost burnt, dried chicken and crap load of chicken fat pieces. So disappointed. Sonic, way to blow it. I don't think I want to give you another dollar."}
{"text":"I love Sonic... But this location has an issue with their slushies.  I visited a few months ago and was disappointed when the slush tasted off - like their water filter needed to be replaced perhaps. It tasted like our sink water more than anything else. They said they fixed the issue and we returned - and it was much better.

Visited today and experienced the same issue - slush tasted off.  This leads me to conclude it's an ongoing issue and I'm hesitant to order another slushie or water based drink from them again. If it's the water filter, (or whatever it is) they need to keep on top of the maintenance."}
{"text":"At lunch waited 15 minutes to get order then when they bring it it is wrong. They went back came back 10 minutes later wrong again and I left. This is the third time trying place. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Sign up for the text message alerts. They send you some awesome deals. I hate that they no longer have green apple for there slush."}
{"text":"Taters tots are always good,ole tyme comfort food with ketchup.the new hot dogs.the club,and the onion and bbq.not so great.to much extras on it,the dogs are good,i would rather go to teds for that,but still good.a grilled cheese and tots night with cherry limeade is always good,never fail.makes a fat kid cry with joy,a pure maouthgasm"}
{"text":"Most terrible service! I waited over an hour for just drinks! I went through the drive through because that's the quickest but I asked for the famous slushies and they didn't even know what I was talking about so I had to go to the window and they didn't even help either. Oh and when I asked a question they just went silent and didn't even try to help me. I was very upset. After waiting an hour for my drinks I asked for cup holders and they forgot to bring it to me I waited another 5 minutes and then realized they weren't coming back so I just left. They have such slow service and not very good customer service! I will never go to that location again! I like sonic but that location just isn't very good!"}
{"text":"I came here tonight while they had a rush. I gave it a chance knowing my order might have been messed up due to them crumbling under order pressure. I did have to wait a bit but was pleasantly pleased on my ordering being correct; all the way to the sauces! I do wish they had brighter lights outside..."}
{"text":"I believe his name is Trevor, super great attitude and very attentive. Brought the food out quickly and had such great mannerism. Normally don't carry cash but I wish I did today to tip him. He's a great asset to this Sonic"}
{"text":"I usually love this sonic as it is close to my house and the food is delicious! Today I went there and it was hot out, so after ordering my food, I backed into the lot with my bumper facing the order station.

I seen one of the workers come out with my order. I waved her down, she looked at me then turned around and skated back into the doors. When I got out and asked what was wrong, I was told that it's against policy for them to serve a car that's backed in because they fear that the person may drive away without paying.

This made me annoyed because for 1). She could have come by and told me instead of looking right at me and turning around. For 2) You think a $6.19 coney is worth me robbing you for? 

Okay, Sonic, feel free to snap back to reality any day now."}
{"text":"I really hate leaving bad reviews. And if I give a negative review, I try to make it constructive and offer feedback that an owner or manager can use to improve. But there is nothing constructive to offer here. This location is bad. Just awful. I stopped ordering food from this location because the quality was inconsistent and the staff usually screwed up the order. I work right around the corner from here and will get drinks when I'm craving something like a milkshake or lime aid. But that's it. 

The problem is the service. The staff just isn't engaged. I'm guessing there is no manager at this location because nobody seems to care about serving customers in a timely manner. It's not unusual to have to wait in a short drive through line (2-3 cats) for close to 30 minutes. It's unbelievable. 

I ran through the drive through today and waited for two minutes at the speaker before I heard a voice over the loud speaker. Except, the guy wasn't talking to me. He was apparently talking to a coworker. I don't know what they were talking about but it was pretty profane, whatever it was. After a few minutes of this, I finally spoke into the speaker to let them know I was there! They took my order, served me my drink and I was on my way. Oh, and the drink was only ¾ filled  

I really hope Sonic can turns things around at this location because I like the restaurant and have had good experiences at other locations."}
{"text":"I just have to review on this place because my husband and I practically live here. I mean with half price drinks and slushes for happy hour and half priced shakes after 8pm, who wouldn't want to hit this place up. Their food is always cooked fresh and is delicious. And the staff is great as well. Great quick place to grab some food or something to drink. Try the Cherry Lime Dr. Pepper and the Chocolate Banana shake! And their Mozzarella Sticks are to die for!"}

{"text":"10 minute wait for our mini and medium Sonic Blasts. We were the only vehicle in the drive thru so not sure why it took a while. However, we were offered a complimentary strawberry shake at the window. I got a mini Oreo & M&M blast which was loaded with toppings ()"}
{"text":"Average time. Ice cream is always good, today I ordered the brownie blast and cookie dough  POINT! Oh yeah with strawberry added. Sooooo good. I will be back"}
{"text":"Kinda upset that they no longer have green 
apple for the slushies. I loved watermelon
And green apple. There $1 chicken
sandwich is yummy and filling."}
{"text":"craved one of their New York hot dogs and tater tots for a quick 'driving back home' snack.

u'd think we'd be in and out (no pun intended) due to the pull-up-and-order style they're known for. unfortunately, our attendant must not have been very competent because she got our order wrong twice, when the food came out it was missing a few things, and even a simple request for ketchup took forever (we actually had to press the Call button again to politely remind them they forgot about us).

i'm sure Keyshawn and the crew at ESPN will agree that that server deserves a big fat \"CMON MAN!\"

-civilities."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I don't expect much from fast food joints. Just got home from our Sonic run... And boy, did it suck. My boyfriend received some coupons in the mail so we decided to grab a quick late night dinner. I wanted to use the \"2 Corndogs For $1\" coupon and my boyfriend decided to try one of their Cheesy Bread Dogs. The girl who took our order seemed confused when I told her I had a coupon for the dollar corndogs. Employees should be aware of active promotions. When I received my receipt, we had been charged $3 dollars for the 2 corndogs and the boy who brought us our food STILL took the coupon even though we had not been charged accordingly. Also, my boyfriends hot dog was placed in the bag UPSIDE DOWN so all toppings had fallen off and were at the bottom of the bag. Made a complete mess of the outside of the bag, our napkins, and my corndogs. His dog was left naked and soggy. Like I said, I don't expect much, but a little common sense would be appreciated. 

1 star because they were at least friendly, another because our shakes were tasty."}
{"text":"First time ever I went on Tuesday to get 1/2 price cheeseburger. The sign on the street and the rolling ads where you order say nothing about it being a specific cheeseburger. When I asked why it was not half-price she went in and asked. She came back and said it was only for the number 1 cheeseburger. That is not what ad says. That is false advertising.  I am calling Sonic company tomorrow."}
{"text":"Two weeks in a row I stopped by in the evening and tried to use he drivethru. Both times no one greeted me and I resorted to driving into a stall. After pushing the button there I was only greeted after the two employees talking to friends outside decided to end their conversation and go back inside to work. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrible service! The wait is endless and my order is never correct. This isn't the first time! Terrible service!"}
{"text":"OMG it was my first time having Sonics and it was not what i expected. In a sense i felt like it was a Wendy's but with service that had a flare to it. I was starving especially after a night of drinking it was a much needed lunch. The tater tots were pretty good. Not too oily but not crunchy enough lol. But one thing i must recommend is the grapesicle. I am not a big fan of grape, but that drink was really good that i would order more. Cherry limeade was ehh... too sweet for my taste. I wish there was a Sonics closer to home. If i wasnt in vegas, i wouldnt have driven all the way out here to try out sonics lol. the waitress that helped us was very nice and kept the conversation going. sadly the only thing i can remember was that she was from Long Beach"}
{"text":"This location has the best customer service and is generally very quick. I frequent the happy hour drinks and haven't been disappointed yet---some of the other locations in Vegas are very slow, so it's not to have this one on top of stuff."}
{"text":"The worst sonic location on planet. Today was the last time I ever come here. The they need new employees.  Now I understand after two years living by them why my husband hates to go there they take for ever to make your food and rude customer service constantly has the longest lines in the world"}
{"text":"friendly staff."}
{"text":"I came during the 2-5pm half price for slushies. I ordered strawberry lemonade and watermelon with rainbow candy. Once I got my order, I didn't expect my drinks to be watered down. This wasn't what I expect a slush to be! At least it was cheap...but I'll probably never order a slush from here again."}
{"text":"We are regular customers at the Sonic location at 1260 S Val Vista Drive in Mesa AZ. 
I was baffled that when I asked for a cup of water, I was asked what size and told the different prices for the different sizes of cups for WATER! I told them a courtesy cup size would be fine.  That's when I was told that is not offered.  

I drove up to the window and asked to speak to the manager.  I asked her how they can charge for WATER  in Arizona and she told me her boss said they have to charge and if someone complains tell them they can use the hose!  

I've never heard such a thing and am shocked and infuriated that this is their policy!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the beverages.  The frozen strawberry lemonade was amazing. I went a second time and tried a strawberry milkshake.  Tasted like a standard strawberry milkshake.  I'll stick with the lemonades, they're amazing. I've heard from many to order the beverages and skip the food options. Tried a footlong coney today. It was alright, overly firm, I toasted bun which made it even soggier with coney sauce. 

Took 15-20 min to wait for an order placed at the counter. One frozen lemonade, one strawberry shake and two footlong coneys.  Only one person ahead of me. The person behind me was still waiting for just two bags of ice when I was leaving."}

Stoners, beware!  This block of West Flamingo is dangerous. Enter at your own risk.

There are medical marijuana dispensaries on both sides of this Sonic Drive Thru.  Check out the video!

They sell you pot, knowing damn well you are going to get the munchies.  They know you're going to end up next door at Sonic.  By the time you finish your feast, you need to burn again.  Back to the dispensary. 

It's an endless loop.  Stoners check in, but they never check out.

{"text":"Just you basic Sonic. The parking lot for everything is fairly big but at the end pf the day, it's another Sonic. I've only had the drinks here because of the happy hour. Service is fast and my orders haven't been screwed up yet."}

{"text":"WORST tater tots ever!!!!!   Asked for them to be well done and they were cold and soggy, NOT well done.  Unfortunately I didn't eat there so didn't realize how bad they were until I got home 3 minutes after getting order.  Server only spoke long enough to tell me what was in my bag, no eye contact, no thanks for coming in.... never again!!!!"}
{"text":"I had been craving a milkshake from sonic for weeks, I finally went and got one today! The guy didn't put the lid on all the way, MILK SHAKE EVERYWHERE!!!! All the guy did was offer more napkins! Half of my milkshake spilled out. I even paid more to get extra pie crust in the shake...I et to work to get and my order is completely wrong! It's not brain surgery people!!!!"}
{"text":"It is a damn shame that Sonic has not risen to the level of McDonald's where you can get a soda for a dollar 24/7.  BUT - worse than that is they filled the cup 75% full of ice no matter if you say light ice or not.  Anybody who has ever worked in a restaurant knows soda is pure profit.  Damn you Sonic."}
{"text":"You're usually Sonic. If you get anything fried late at night you'll have to wait a little bit for them to cook it. I usually just swing by and grab a slush of some kind. The Blue Raspberry or Watermelon with Nerds is my go to. Customer service doesn't really stand out. The people are as happy as they can be working at a fast food joint. Nobody has ever been rude though. Just mediocre."}
{"text":"I don't know how many times I have waited over 20 minutes for a simple burger and cold fries. Not to mention countless unmixed, melted slushes. I have never complained about a place in my life. Considering I worked for sonic for three years and have been a server for the past 5. Get your shit together. Dang! Tonight I got a large onion ring instead of a fry. Not even a sorry and a half emptied luke warm fry at that."}
{"text":"I usually come at night, I love ordering cherry lime aids. The area is always clean on the outside, the staff is very friendly. ALWAYS check your food before you leave as sometimes they don't always get the order right. They tend to take awhile to drop food off to the window.  But the friendly staff make up for it."}
{"text":"Terrible. Never coming back to this location. Bad service rude workers, I love closet to this location but I'll just drive to another."}
{"text":"The only reason this place has 3 stars from me is due to not being able to go lower 1 star. The second star is for the consistent food and menu at ALL Sonics and the 3rd star is from the manager in training that tried to make thinks right with me. If not for those factors this place would get a half star at best for the half ass supervisor Dana in drive thru. First off, I go to that location on my lunch break so my time is limited. There is usually a line which is understandable, no complaints there. My issues with this location is the girl on the intercom asks for my order which is just a lime aid. I know it sounds petty but there's more. So she has my order and I get to the window and they asked what my order was again. So I tell her and they start making it. I paid with my card and I realized that they overcharged me because they charged me for the ingredients in the lime aid and the drink was the wrong drink. I called and let them and I got good ol Dana on the phone. She tried to convince me to go back and get another one and I said I can't because I'm back at work. I go there again the next day and order and paid for my drink and saw that the price was lower on this drink so I spoke with the manager-in-training, and told him what happened yesterday. He looked at the receipt and told me they overcharged me and he wanted to make it up to me and comp me some food. I kindly refused and he offered me a free lime aid on my next visit. I said ok, I can go for that. Well, that leads me to today. I was fortunate enough to get Dana at the window. I told her that the manager-in-training left my name at the register for a free drink. She then gave me the he free drink the shoves a coupon at me for $2 off and said that \"since I couldn't wait for her to send it to me, here's your coupon\" I was like \"wait hold on\". She said that I couldn't wait for her to send it and that she's going to have a talk with the manager-in-training because he was out of line in telling me to redeem a free drink. I tried to explain what happened and she still tried to belittle me and talk over me in front of her working peers. I called the store and asked for her and to further explain myself and it's still the same. She talks over me on the phone and is very argumentative. It's ok, the conversation on the phone was recorded. The truth is on the recording that I have and I'll speak to the store manager. If nothing becomes of this I'll talk to the franchise owner. With the exception of the manager in training, everyone over there has no idea what customer service is."}
{"text":"The employees at this location are nice, but rarely have what we order when we come in. We typically come at off time, not at happy hour. When we ask, they never have an answer."}
{"text":"I gave this place a 2nd chance for breakfast. Apparently, when you ask for not tomatoes you get them anyways. :-/ I'm never going back there again"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I went to Sonics today for the Car Hop deal where you get a cheeseburger and fries.  Well, I get toward the end of my burger and find a curly black hair that still had the root.  So I threw the rest of my burger away and showed it to my co-workers.  It's safe to say that I'm not coming back this Sonics ever again."}
{"text":"I can't comment if this place is good or not because I was not able to be served at this location. 

They ran out of ice cream before I showed up, how does a business that focuses on \"half off shakes\" run out of ice cream?!?, however the car hop did come over and let us know and he was very nice and apologetic. 

I will try again in the future however this made me pretty off put on this location."}
{"text":"Growing up I could walk to a Sonic from my house.  So I am too familiar with all the goodness that America's drive-in has to offer.  When we moved to Vegas we noticed that Sonic's are here in Vegas but not a lot.  We live over by the South point so we actually have to travel to the 2 Sonic's that are sort of close by.  If you haven't had a sonic burger, toaster, or coney then you are probably from the east coast.  Sonic is the place in the southwest.  I will always get a Super Sonic Cheeseburger.  How can you go wrong when the word \"Super\" is in the name of your burger.  I am from New Mexico and you will notice that there is a topping called green chiles.  Don't confuse this with jalapenos.  This is the real deal and I think it is actually hatch green chile.  My wife always gets the coney dog.  Sonic was also one of the first fast food place to serve breakfast all day.  I don't really like eating in the car but we have 2 small children and it's kind of easy when they are strapped in their seats.  So if you haven't had a Sonic burger you are missing out.  Make sure to get cheese and green chiles on your burger! Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is the closest Sonic to my home.  Went there last night around 10pm for a shake.  Woke up this morning to a phone call from my bank's fraud department asking about a purchase made early this morning using my credit card number.  Thanks Sonic for attempting to rip me off.  Thought something fishy was going on with the employees as two people attempted to obtain payment from me.  One seemed \"surprised\" when we told her that we had already paid.  You haven't heard the last of me."}
{"text":"Why isn't zero or negative stars an option? Waited for our food for over 15 mins at one of the car hop stations after it said that our 'Car Hop' was on their way. Then we decided to get a shake to go as we left and we sat in the drive thru line after we ordered our drink for 20 mins just to get to the window to not even get an apology for the wait. Our cashier didn't even greet us just told us the total. Then once he gave us our card back and we thanked him, he handed us our shake and shut the window. No goodbye, no apology, no manners. Obviously I don't expect a red carpet rolled out at Sonic but I do expect basic manners and customer service. But that's obviously too much to ask."}
{"text":"I absolutely do not like this sonics. The employees are rude and just for drinks, I've waited half an hour....TWICE! I refuse to come to this one! I will go out of my way to go somewhere else. They definitely will not be getting my money."}
{"text":"Most disgusting place I've ever been too. The burger was so stale I couldn't bite through it. The hot dogs were super rubbery. Took one bite and threw it back in the bag. If I didn't have to wait so long for service I would have demanded my money back. What a waste."}
{"text":"I get in line for the drive thru and they tell me they're not using it right now. So I wait for a spot then after I get one there are people getting food from the drive thru. When we're talking to the lady on the mic ordering we tell her we can't hear her and she starts yelling into the speaker. She was very rude.. attitude for no reason.."}
{"text":"These idiots on Halloween were out of their. .50 cent corn dogs before 6 pm. Really!!!! Bad management right their. And now on a trip there they are out of the grilled cheese special by 6 pm. Won't be here again I guess."}
{"text":"My favorite summer-time treat from Sonic is the Frozen Cherry Limeade. This location rarely seems to be able to make one of these properly. I've been twice in the past two weeks and both times my drink was 90% cherry and 10% limeade. I've been to other locations and they all seem to make these drinks better.

So I guess I'll just find another location."}
{"text":"Came to the stall and pushed the red button and was never answered, finally drove back to the drive thru and was attended by a very nice person and my order was server quickly. I order a double bacon burger and they missed one of the patties. As soon as I open the burger the smell reminded me of an old used sock. The burger patty was old and also the bacon. It tasted really bad. Also I order an iced coffee, it tasted like I had tried to make it at home for the first time, they really need to work on the flavor. The tots were good.
Im never coming back to this Sonic location"}
{"text":"Both a Drive-In and a Drive-Thru, this is nice contrast in both price and and what's on the menu from the nearby casinos. The food is good, the drinks are better, and eating here is more enjoyable than going to most other fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Horrible. Just horrible. The service at this place is not even WORTH how good the cherry limeades are. I consistently try and go here just for them. But never again. I'm giving up all hope for this place. If you're reading this review in hopes of going there, DONT. You'll leave an hour later with less than half of what you ordered."}
{"text":"half price shakes after 8pm, expect long wait times"}
{"text":"Worst experience at Sonic EVER!  The order takers either aren't listening or can't hear or the new speakers aren't working properly. We had to repeat ourselves multiple times for each item ordered and they were trying to add other things to the order. Luckily, now they have the screen that shows what is being put into the computer. I don't even know what could have possibly sounded like \"milk\" in the few things we tried to order.

10:45 in the morning and they don't have hot coffee? And they aren't making anymore because we were told to choose something else. They asked if we wanted iced coffee instead and then tried to charge more on the combo because they were too lazy to take a pack of coffee grounds and put them in a filter and push a button to brew it.
Additionally the letter are so small on the menu that anything other than the price and name, it can't even be read...so when I tried to order a French toast stick meal with the drink in the picture, it rang an extra charge...maybe they should change that.

We were finally so fed up when we were almost finished ordered after he put in fries instead of tots (notice how they don't sound anything alike) that we just couldn't go through dealing with them anymore and had to leave. Awful! Completely awful
And yes, I get it is just Sonic, but they should have better service than a McDonalds"}
{"text":"The employees I encountered barely speak English. They were semi busy so it took a while to get my order in and the freakin thing didn't even come out any sort of correctly. I also realize that the carhops do not make regular minimum wage so i also tip. This is the first time that I absolutely refuse to. She didn't even bring a spoon for the sundae so my kid could start eating it while we had to wait for our food to come out at different times."}
{"text":"The sign said that the drive thru was open. We waited for a few minutes and even talked into the speaker with no answer. As we passed the window, we saw employees inside and the one closest to the drive thru window was in her own world and not paying attention. After spending the last 23 hours packing and moving, we just wanted a little something to eat....ended up getting a snack from QT next door instead.  The website says that the minimum hours are 6am - 10pm, so 630am should be good to be served something."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for too many years to count. Sometimes the drive thru is a bit slow but the staff is always pleasant, through all the years. My food is always consistent, it's prepared & tastes the same every time. Always like the specials, & love happy hour drinks. Some of our regular food items - cheeseburger, double cheeseburger, mozzarella sticks, popcorn chicken, chili cheese coney, jalapeno poppers, fries, tater tots. We've tried too many drinks & milkshakes to even mention. We will continue to be regulars here."}
{"text":"So sad that the old Sonic is not around Scottsdale. The staff use to be so nice. I went to this Sonic HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No refills on drinks you have to buy another drink. Staff is not very nice and hate the drive thru.

Will not go back."}
{"text":"When it is blazing hot in Phoenix, get a ice cold beverage which they have lots of.  One block away from the office I work in when I go to Phoenix so it is pretty sweet."}
{"text":"This is, without doubt, the worst Sonic I've ever been to.  Thing is, they have been bad nearly since they opened. I foolishly give them another try every nine months or so but they never get better.  They have not successfully delivered my order in probably ten years and today was no exception. There is always something wrong or missing...without fail. Unless you aren't particularly interested in getting what you order, you would be wise to avoid this nightmare."}
{"text":"This is the WORST location ever! The last time I will ever go there. I've had a number of bad experiences. They always get my order wrong. I've been over charged twice. The employees don't care and the wait is soooo long! I always see cars leaving the drive thru line bc the wait is so long. I love buying thier bags of ice but not at this location any more. Going to start going to a different location."}
{"text":"Very happy with our trip to sonic tonight. The food was tasty and as expected. The prices are always great between Tuesday 1/2 price burgers and happy hour drinks but more importantly the service was good. Our two year old dropped his hot dog on the ground so they brought us a new one for free."}
{"text":"I love Sonic. When I was away from Charlotte I would go to a Sonic to help me get over my homesickness. Sonic off Arrowood Rd is awesome. I have never had bad service and the food has always been great. I love the milkshakes and they have great hot dogs. You should go there for a sundae you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"We like the specials. This particular location has new touch screens. It is only to view part of the menu. They should have the ordering integrated into their new screens. All locations should do the same with bringing out the food. All condiments, plastic utensils, napkins and such in separate bag. Food in the other bags. Think this will help big time with any confusion to what may be missing or just hiding."}
{"text":"I give props to the young lady trying her skates and catching herself nearly falling or tripping every time."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, especially during the half price shakes promotions they do every year.  Got large strawberry, caramel, and hot fudge Friday night March 31, 2018 at around 9pm.  It was packed so they were a little slower than usual, and a guy got pulled over by the cops and was even forced to put his hands on the hood of his truck so I'm sure the workers were busy looking at that going down. We froze the shakes for Easter Sunday the next day.  Come to find out there was no caramel in the large caramel shake.  After church went back to Sonic with the receipt and cup to show there was no caramel residue at all at around 4:30pm but the young lady said the manager said it had to be the same day for them to give us a new shake or whatever.  I think that's b.s. because they were really slow in filling out our order because of gawking at the guy with his hands on the hood of his truck because of the cops.  We've been there when it was packed before and it wasn't as slow as it was Friday night, all because the employees were looking at that traffic stop, and we never had an order messed up especially the shakes, so the workers were obviously preoccupied with the cops investigating that pick up truck driver to put caramel in the shake.  So we get stiffed on the caramel shake and now the time and gas to go back to the location because they wouldn't rectify the situation.  Been going here for years so much that workers would know what we would be ordering and I don't know if we will go to any other Sonics anymore but we will definitely not go to this one anymore."}
{"text":"I like this place. My husband and I usually come here after I get off work at get the 1/2 price after 8 pm slushy. And on Tuesday, they offer 1/2 price cheeseburgers from 5 pm to close, Family night."}
{"text":"I remember all the hype in my hometown when Sonic opened.  I still don't understand what all the hype is about.  The food is decent but nothing is that outstanding besides maybe the tater tots.

The shakes also just OK in my opinion, I normally only go here for happy hour or if I have a coupon."}
{"text":"Best sonic on the planet.  The ladies are friendly and prompt. The indoor area is clean with tvs and shit. Never waiting, never screw with my food or my order. Haha. They just checked on me again..I guess I better leave before I order more shit..lol"}
{"text":"The outdoor table I'm sitting at is hotter than these chicken strips, and equally edible. Granted it's a $5 Sunday special, apparently you get what you pay for. The drink is their saving grace, sometimes you drink a Rt44 limeade for lunch and throw the rest in the trash."}
{"text":"Wow.. Says they close at midnight, 11:23 pm and everyone's inside waiting for their ride and all the lights off and they just stare at us as we pull up lol wish I could give 0 stars"}
{"text":"I've been waiting in the drive thru since 6:49 and I haven't even made it to the speaker box to order (and I know my timing is correct cause I checked when I ended my phone call as I was pulling in). It's now 7:07. Bad, bad, horrible service."}
{"text":"They take forever to take your order good thing they do not have a drive thru or else they would suffer. They had me waiting for 10 minutes before I was helped!!!!"}
{"text":"Route 44 cherry slushy with extra cherry juice at 9pm. Cost me $2.09 and such a treat it reminded me of I what state I was in!  Had the trip been any more stressful, I would have put a little (or a lot ) of vodka in it and then I would have more to say!

Nice service and great drink!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Sonic nor much fast food in general, but after dragging the man around town to see where I used to work ( moved back to CA just under 5 years ago), where I used to live as a teen, where I went to HS, where I owned a house, where my Grandparents used to live, etc. he felt like he deserved a treat and I agreed. Had we had more time and he endured the early childhood tour (3-10), he could have had Mary Coyle :)

Sonic has these crazy drink slushy concoctions and ice cream and just plain stoner food (chili, cheese and fritos wrapped in a tortilla). Since we were not hungry, he wanted an ice cream cone and a cherry lime slushy thing. So, we pull up, push a button and order. I had a large Diet Dr. Pepper, he had drink and cone...total $3.00! Why so cheap we wonder...then we see...Sonic has a happy hour on their drinks from 2-4pm. GTFO!! Seriously cool.

Why only 3 stars then...well, that was for the $3.00. Hey, it is fast food folks and to be honest, once I drank my drink and got down to the ice, I remembered that Phoenix water tastes nasty and that makes for nasty ice-even if it is crushed."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this location and ordering the jalapeno poppers. Highly disappointed they are inedible, I'm not sure if the grease was not hot enough or what. This will be my last time visiting this location."}
{"text":"Great for a few reasons.  1. Cherry Limeade 2. Shakes 3. Blasts 4. Always open.  Pretty good for their burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Good fast-food and  pretty tasty! The workers aren't very friendly though. The service was quick."}
{"text":"Things at this Sonic have gone from bad to worse.  The quality had been failing and the staff doesn't even have a clue what they are doing.  Today was the best one yet.  We went there for breakfast and they have a special where large drinks are .99.  That should be simple, well not for them or their  management staff.  We get the receipt and they charge us 1.99.  Should be and easy fix, should be, well it wasn't.  We were told they can't refund it they already ran the card, sorry.  They gave us a coupon for a .99 drink for later.  How does that fix it?  No matter how many ways we explain, they don't get it.  I understand they are young, but they need someone with more  management training there to help. Get it together Sonic."}
{"text":"Bought two kids meals. Got home only one in the bag! How hard can that be. Should have checked the bag before I left, that's on me! But ordered two kids meals... wife is driving back now to get the other meal... we stopped on our way home and it's not close! No way I'm going back!"}
{"text":"The service at this place was absolutely abhorrent! I ordered my food and waited 30 minutes for it to even arrive! After I got my food the worker there forgot my drink. I reminded her that I ordered a cherry limeade and she said she would bring it right out. I waited another two minutes for her to end up bringing me a cherry sprite which I didn't find out until I tried my drink when I got home. I don't think they treated me well as a customer and the worker definitely wasn't listening to me if she brought me the wrong drink literally a minute after I repeated to her multiple times which one I wanted. To top it all off, when I got back to my house which is 3 miles away, my food was cold! It's like they didn't even bother to cook it! Someone should be fired at this place. It's safe to say I won't be back again."}
{"text":"The absolute worst fast food place I have ever been to in my entire life. 
The wait was outrageous last night when I went. 
AND they messed up my order for the THIRD time in a row. 
The place looks like it's ran by high school drop outs. I will never come back. 
You guys are absolute trash at your jobs and if I could give you a -5 stars I absolutely would."}
{"text":"The ice cream machine is ALWAYS \"broken\". Or \"you're just lazy and have poor customer service\", sounds about right to me."}
{"text":"Slowest service I've ever had at a Sonic! It should not take 20 minutes to make a mini master blast. Beyond ridiculous!"}
{"text":"NEGATIVE STARS!!! Asked for honey mustard 3 times and never got it.. the girl with blonde hair looked at us 3 times knowing we asked her for honey mustard and still ignored us. Very unprofessional service! 6/29 12:59pm"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love me some Sonic, but this is probably the worst location I've ever been to. In the dozen or so times I've visited this location, they have NEVER gotten my order right. Their speakers are often broken too, so I've had to pull into two or three different stalls before finding a working speaker. The food's good enough, the usual Sonic fare, but I wouldn't call it fast. Be sure to allow time to send your order back and have them fix it."}
{"text":"Pretty sad on $1 hot dog day and they only have 1 person scheduled to work.... Just wrong for the worker who has to cook checkout and just do it all"}
{"text":"No joke, I actually witnessed a mugging in this parking lot.  I was in my car in the drive thru, and I almost hit a guy who came running out in front of me.  Too bad I didn't, because if I had, I would have stopped him from running off with some poor girl's purse!  Needless to say, this restaurant has been forever imprinted on my mind as the place where I witnessed a mugging.  

However, it was also pretty decent hangover food.  I was in Vegas for my 21st birthday when this all occurred, so I was hungover as hell after three crazy nights out with my sorority sisters.  I got a bunch of fried food for pretty cheap, and it really helped me on the drive home.  Would I recommend this to someone on a diet?  Absolutely not!  But would I recommend it to someone who just needs to recover from a crazy night at JET or Tryst?  Why the hell not!"}
{"text":"What a cool way to buy fast food during a heatwave, late at night in your jammies, or any time.

Daughter was hungry for a Sonic burger#1. 

Spotted a Sonic sign ahead. We pulled into the parking lot of a fast food joint. Colorful 3' x 4' screens separated each parking space on the driver's side. 

I immediately recognized the old car hop vibe. Pulled into an empty space. Kept the engine running and air condition blasting. The screen turned out to be the menu, speaker, and ATM all in one. WHAT?!?!?! How innovative.

Scanned the menu for items I wanted to order.

Pressed the speaker button to alert the assistant inside that I was ready to order. A very pleasant, disembodied voice took my order, then said she'd be out in a few with my order. Ok, let's see how fast . . . 

In the meantime I inserted my credit card to finalize the transaction. Receipt rolled out.

As promised, within minutes a sweet young lady arrived balancing a red tray loaded with 2 paper bags and a couple of drinks. She confirmed my order according to the receipt printed out on her side, then she handed over my booty.

Handed her a tip and I was on my way with a Sonic burger & fries, classic hot dog with the works, condiments, a limeade and a blue coconut slush and 2 peppermint candies. Yaowzaaaaa!

No Sonic anywhere near where I live, but when they show up I'll be one of the first in line. Love their vibe.

{"text":"Drive up menu busted had to move car to another car port.  Food, however, awesome!  Also credit card machine broken car hop took transaction and unfortunately there are no free refills.  Their fountain drinks are so good and the crushed iced is just right.  Great spot for a quick bite to eat without getting out of your car.  I wish we had these in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Drove up at 9:40 to a parking stall to order waited around 20 minutes for someone to take my order after pushing the button, heard 3 other people get their order taken that had arrived after me. Changed parking spots to see if button was broken heard another order after waiting for 15 more minutes still no one to take my order so I went to jack in the box down the street. Didn't even get to place my order worst sonic I have ever been to."}
{"text":"I ordered half price milkshakes after 8pm and they waited until I got to the window to tell me that the half off promotion ended in August. She then proceeded to give me the wrong flavored milkshake. She told me she would go back in and remake it so it was the right one and took my debit card to charge it. She charged my debit card and THEN brought the same milkshake back out and told me they no longer had the flavor I wanted. She didn't ask me if there was another flavor I wanted before taking my payment. She forced me to take the milkshake I didn't want. Both of our shakes tasted horrible and it was $11 that I could have spent on much better things."}
{"text":"I came here this morning with my wife and I ordered the Toasted bacon sand which. It looked more like to warm pieces of bread that were very soggy and cheese. Where was the bacon? 
Seriously, you had one job. i was so upset i literally threw it out the window at a some pigeons that i seen. i would have went back but i could not be late to work. Def will not be returning."}
{"text":"First time here.  Not impressed.  We ordered 5 hot dog meals.  Hot dogs were cold.  We will mot be coming back!"}
{"text":"Sonic Drive-In gives you the option to park and order and a carhop will bring you your food or you can use the drive thru. The menu here has lots of junk food options sonic has breakfast you can order all day, burgers, chicken sandwiches, corn dogs, grilled cheese sandwich, cheddar peppers, BLT'S,mozzarella sticks, and TOT'S! I love tot's and I always get them when I eat here. You also have hundreds of drink options available here you can customize your soda, slush, or milkshake. I know the service is slow but that's because everything is made to order. I used to work here and I still eat here because I know that all the food is fresh."}
{"text":"Just left Sonic and it was the worst experience I've ever had in my life at a fast food place. The woman who took our order cut us off in the middle of our order and it was a small order (1 slush, an order of mozzarella sticks, and 1 cookie dough blast no whip) not only did she cut us off so she never got the no whip part. When they finally brought out the blast, the guy who brought the food to our car started telling us about his weekend and the kind of music that he liked and the blast still had whip on it. So we asked them to remake it. Which took 20 minutes and 10 minutes of the guy giving us the low down on his life before giving us the cookie dough blast that had 0 cookie dough in it. Finally we just went through the drive through, and finally the guy in the drive through window knew what he was doing and fixed it for us right away. Just ridiculous! 45 minutes for 3 items all because one person couldn't hold off for 1 second till we said no whip. What if we wanted to order more food? Bad business and bad services. Go to another sonic"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location since 2008. Tell me why I order a master blast shake at the drive through at 8 pm which for what ever reason took the longest time to receive due to the line of 3 cars in front of me. I pay the lady, who by the way was not friendly at all, not even once smiled [not sure what her problem is] every one else I've dealt with smiles or just simply friendly. So I get my master blast and it looks melted on top so I'm just what ever about thinking the rest is still frozen and thick. I get home which is literally across the street and it's completely melted. I'm beyond irritated with this service makes me think I should of took my business somewhere else for a frozen Treat.

Update: talked to the manager norma and she was very nice and fixed the problem."}
{"text":"Sonic is one of the better fast food chains out there. They offer a different selection like tater tots, grilled cheese sandwich, and you can make your own flavored soda or slushies! I really never had a bad meal, and I like the nostalgic drive in! Their crew seems to be very friendly, and haven't had a wrong order yet. I'm not much into this place but since the wife gets her way all the time, and she is a grilled cheese person. Well I really don't have to say anything else! You get the picture!!!"}
{"text":"One of my daughter's favorite places  Always great service always friendly people no matter what time of the day it is. ... we absolutely love this Sonic."}
{"text":"I've been coming here almost twice a week just to get their milkshakes. For only less than $3 you get this awesome milkshake that will have no problem in satisfying you. It's so creamy and thick (which is a plus in my book). 

Service is also cute. Sonic is a drive in fast food place. You order on this machine by pressing a button and talking to an employee. Once you're done they bring out your order by skating over to you! Yes, the staff wears rollerblades. They give you the food and you pay. 

Sonic is pretty cheap when it comes to food as well, but I'll update my review once I've tried a variety of items."}
{"text":"I really don't know how my son and I ended up at this location? There is one closer to where I live!! Anyway, son was down visiting from the dreaded S.F.!!! Now when we both lived in SoCal, we use to visit a Sonics in Anaheim after hockey practice. So we have always enjoyed Sonic's. We both ordered breakfast, I had their breakfast burrito with bacon. I thought it was good, not to much salt which is good to me! Son had the texas toast breakfast sandwich! Even though we both like the bread, it is a little to large trying to wrap your mouth around it! They were very nice, and got our food out very quickly."}
{"text":"Did not look at the reviews before I decided to go down the street to Sonic and fetch myself some kind of ice cream treat....matter of fact, this was the first time I have visited a Sonic Drive In.  Always liked their commercials with those two goofy guys. Anyway, drove in an parked, nice summer night so the top was down. The menu is huge, but being a bit lactose intolerant I did not want to have too much ice cream as I would regret it for the rest of the evening, so I was looking for the SMALL size of something. I settled on a Banana Split thing, I am sure it has a specific name but they all looked the same to me. Well, I got it in short order and it was great. Little bits of all kind of stuff, banana, strawberry, nuts quite tasty. So, I can say that I approve and being that it is right around the corner I have a place to go.....although I would prefer a really good gelato."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and they seemed confused about two milkshakes.... Then pulled up and waited for 15 minutes. They came out and asked us twice if this was our order and both times it was the cars behind us. We just left. Horrible service honestly."}
{"text":"Sadly Sonic has become a typical fast food franchise. They were better then this in years past. However now, food is just OK and the quality has fallen far from the level it has been years ago. Now, the only reason to come here is for the dessert and beverages. Service is fine, however like any other fast food franchise you are getting the up and coming kids just starting off in life or just a job for the summer. (Which is fine)

I did try their Hatch Green Chili burger. I has a lot of heat, and the burger was OK. Not nearly as good at WB. Not their fault, the city allowed them to build there. I think it sucks that they are right up against residency homes. 

Kids will like this place."}
{"text":"The drive-thru at this location is open 24 hours, which is very convenient for those \"midnight cravings.\" 

The food tastes great, but sometimes all the greasiness over powers everything and just makes me feel gross. I usually buy a Powerade Mountain Blast Slush or a Grape Slush to wash down some chili cheese tots, which in hindsight is totally unhealthy every way you look at it, LOL.

When I'm craving something really sweet, I always get their French Toast sticks. 

Service here is average."}
{"text":"Good food! But they keep getting the orders wrong! Went there twice! Shame! Ordered a meal and it was without fries! Ordered a nerds slush drink and recieved a slush drink without nerds! Get the order right and I'll change the stars!"}
{"text":"I pretty much only ever come here to buy a drink, so I haven't had to deal with extreme slowness, but here's a word of advice: I hope you don't come here hoping to use a gift card or the sonic app to pay for your order. The self-service kiosks are often busted. If the staff has to process the order manually, they will act as though they're being asked to prove the Pythagorean Theorem. I watched in rapt fascination once, for 20ish minutes, as three of them worked together to figure out how to use their own restaurant's app. The struggle was real.

They also have a super difficult time getting orders right, and if you order, say, a diet Dr. Pepper with diet cherry, expect to find a quarter inch layer of cherry syrup at the bottom of your cup. I've also nearly inhaled bits of plastic that have come up through my straw before. Very disconcerting.  

I know we're not dining at the Ritz here, but Jesus, is no one actually minding the store?"}
{"text":"I feel like it's hard to be so sub-par at food that is basically designed to be sub-par. I've been to this sonic multiple times now and the next time I have good experience will be the first. 

For example on the most recent experience: I pull up to the empty drive through (which some how doesn't actually have a normal drive through window) and wait, and wait, and then wait some more before I finally ask a questions into the speaker, then it's like pulling teeth to get an answer to my simple question \"what options are there on flavors for the custard.\" I get and answer and then place my order and my girlfriends. I hear the woman repeat back the wrong order and not pause long enough for me to spit out the \"not it's an XXX shake not YYY\" which i finally say after hoping she heard. Pull up and wait for 2 simple ice creams to be made. Come out and of course they made the wrong shake, wanting to go we just took the wrong one as the carhop took my credit card to run it (maybe thinking he'd discount it since it was the wrong shake but not really caring at that point). Nope nothing.

That's a typical experience here, waiting and waiting and a wrong order.

Only reason we come back is that my girlfriend loves sonic and they haven't been able to make ice cream taste bad, yet which gets them 2 stars. However having now read the other reviews of mold and hair I think those days are over."}
{"text":"This is the worst food, and it's gotten worse since their value menu.  The service was horrible, I brought in a coupon, read the exact item off the coupon and when I went to the window, they insisted I had ordered the larger, deluxe item and forced me to take it.  Lousy dog, worse chili, sorry folks, I won't be back - I wanted to try the drinks but after that experience, yuck, I can't see it."}
{"text":"Who loves Sonic? Me!  For the food?  Not really.  I love their tater tots and their cream slushies.

Sonic is a great place to experience the drive in . Some of them have the servers on skates while some don't, but either way it's fun to order from your car and have someone bring you the food.  

I think the cream slushies are awesome and I love going there a couple days a week for a blue coconut one.  Tater tots are always great to snack on, and theirs are awesome!

If you want have late night or early morning munchies their drive thru is open 24/7, so stop on it for a sweet treat and tots!"}
{"text":"Wow. The bread on my breakfast toaster wasn't even toasted. Then it was saturated with butter making a sandwich a grease ball mess. My girlfriend's was the same. I took one bite and threw it back in the bag. Then it went into the trash. 

What was the cook thinking? I mean, both the sandwiches were drowning in grease. You would either have to be completely clueless or intentionally malicious to make a sandwich like we w

They get 2 stars because the people in the drive thru were courteous. 

I will NEVER be back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Sorry but this Sonic needs to get there game face on. 

Don't charge me for a cup of water. That's restaurant techniques 101.

Please confirm the order before making me pay and bringing the wrong chili dog.

Don't try and charge me regular price when you have a promotion that day. The cashier played dumb. 

Get your act together or pack up and leave town."}
{"text":"I love the Cherry Limeades here! I come here mostly for the hot dogs, sometimes a treat. They have happy hour specials every day from 2-4 and from open to 11 am. Don't expect some over the top burger though."}
{"text":"I'm never been so disappointed with sonic before. Anytime I go to this location they always mess up my order, make me wait forever to even order my drink, and are extremely rude. This location makes me not want to spend my money at any sonic anymore. I would rate 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, mostly clean outdoor sitting area. The food last time I was there was disappointing but that may just be because I wasn't very hungry."}
{"text":"Had not been to a Sonic in many years. I had forgotten all about the retro drive-in with servers on rollerskates. When my husband suggested this I felt like we were on a date back in the 1960s. I ordered a small chocolate shake and he ordered a large one. The shakes were good, but I could have done without the fake whipped cream on top. We did like the cherry on top of the fake whipped cream. My husband also had a small fries and a bacon double cheeseburger. I just had the double cheese burger without the bacon (I could already feel my arteries clogging from the saturated fat). 

The food was ready quickly and tasted like I remember from years ago. I would say the burger was better than Burger King or McDonalds but not as good as In N Out burger. My husband disagreed and felt that it was indeed as good as In N Out burger. The price was less than Carls Jr. but more than In N Out for the same foods.

This Sonic also had a drive-through, and outdoor eating area, as well as the drive-in area. Service was friendly and speedy. The eating areas were clean and they even had the place decorated for Halloween. OK, not healthy, but definitely a lot of fun."}
{"text":"If you want to wait an hour for 2drinks go here. I watched the manager tonight just stand and stare at the employees instead of telling them how to do their job. Linda the drive thru lady refused to acknowledge us waiting in the car and when she finally did, she held up her finger towards us to \"hold on\". When I finally get my shake there's random shit on the cherry. I don't even know what's in my shake. And of course they don't give you a receipt so you can't do the survey. Worst Sonic I've been to!"}

{"text":"We waited 20 minutes when there was only one car ahead of us. The food was not fresh; my lettuce was old, my crispy chicken had a ton of breading and little chicken inside. Ugh, i couldn't finish the sandwich or my greasy tots. So disappointed."}
{"text":"They got our order wrong more than three times, even though we only ordered three meals. And the guy complains that he could barely hear us through the mike, despite the fact we were practically yelling at him. very dissapointed in my favorite drive through"}
{"text":"We've stopped by here from time to time, usually for a bevvy.  

My favorites of course are Diet Coke and Iced Tea.  LOVE their soft-crunchy ice.

This location is reliable.  They are usually fast, and always accurate.  


My most recent visit was last night around 11pm, for the perpetually starving teen- just picked her up from a friend's house (and I KNOW they fed her dinner).  Don'tcha just hate those folks that eat around the clock, are stylishly thin, and can put down a large order of tots without blinking an eye?  Me too, usually, 'cept when it's my baby.

This late night visit included super fast n friendly service on rollerskates, combined w accuracy of order delivered.  Piping hot Tots, I had two, so I know.  Ketchup in the bag, along with 3 napkins."}
{"text":"I judge my ratings on places like these by the speed,  frustration factor or lack there-of, cleanliness, and competence of the employees.

I usually go to Sonic for Iced Tea or Diet Coke.

They get my orders right, and are always friendly.  They have a few REALLY good employees here as well, in terms of customer service!

The place appears to be clean- parking lot is picked up, and I haven't noticed anything gross here  that makes me want to leave.

An interesting note- a lot of people eat here AT the Sonic, at the tables.  I think this is representative of the neighborhood and a relatively young crowd.  It's a positive thing to see that people will stay to eat and visit, not just drive thru.

Sometimes this location can be slow for unknown reasons- maybe the waiter on skates is cooking in the back?  If I see a line, it makes me nervous and I don't stop."}
{"text":"Perfect example of why fast food workers don't need $15/hr. Have a 75% fail rate on getting simple orders correct. Poor service. Check every item before you leave window, and that only if every other fast food joint has burned down."}
{"text":"Love coming here for their super long chili cheese hit dogs and a refreshing drink!  So many delicious drinks to choose from on these extremely hot days here in Phoenix.  I park, eat, drink and am happy."}
{"text":"The service at the drive in was extremely slow, and the person taking the order did not listen to the order.  Not only was my order totally wrong, but my drink was also filled to the top with ice leaving very little room for actual soda.  I will not be returning to this location as this is the second time I have had service issues."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience at this location. I typically avoid the drive thru, unless I am the only car, because the service is extremely slow. I went there a couple days ago to just get a drink. There was a line in the drive thru, so I pulled into a car stall. They took my order relatively quickly, but I ended up leaving about 15 minutes later with no drink. I just wanted to get a drink on my way to a ball game, but no such luck. I will not revisit this location unless I have at least 30 minutes to spare."}
{"text":"So far every experience here had been positive.  I swear some of these reviewers expect 5 star restaurant dining experiences.  It's a drive in fast food joint. I'm not saying lower your expectations below the acceptable, but, come on, it's Sonic."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have recently moved to this side town, and were super excited to see that there was a Sonic conveniently close to our new home. Well that didn't last long, as the service is probably some of the worst that we have dealt with as far as being treated rudely, poor quality, etc. We were surprised by this seeing how the area in which it is located is a pretty nice and newer development... literally just just got home with my order, and pull my food out of the the aluminum sleeve (foot long coney) it is a regular hot dog bun with a foot long hot dog, not fully covered in chili, also no cheese... I can't speak for all, but every Sonic I have ever been to in the past has been great with service, and quality but as far as this location goes I have literally 5/5 times had a bad experience. Such a shame to have one location give off such a bad vibe compared to all the others."}
{"text":"The food was fine, came out fast, and the person who delivered it was friendly. I don't expect much out of fast food so this is totally fine, HOWEVER, they forgot my sauces - ok, I should've checked, no big deal.
The big issue is that my boyfriend and I ordered a blue raspberry slushy and they gave us the coconut one. Luckily he drank it before I did because I'm HIGHLY allergic to coconut. 
It was a bummer and that drink got thrown directly in the trash. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"I do like Sonic, but this is iffy on this one.  It's not your average Sonic Drive in.  Come to think of it, I'm still unsure why they call it a Drive In, when its actually inside a Walmart Shopping Center.  Sure enough, they do get business from Walmart shoppers, but on the other hand, it can be a bad thing too.  

Located inside Walmart off 215 and Decatur is where Sonic Drive In, is located.  Usually I probably would see McDonald's inside a Walmart but it is interesting to have something different.  It does give Sonic that \"fast food restaurant\" feel to it, instead of sitting in your car and eat.  Which is good for those who like the restaurant feel and not drop lettuce or crumbs in between the car seats.  It's not big as an actual fast food restaurant, but big enough to have a place to sit, eat and stay out of the sun.  

What I dislike about it, is that, you have the shoppers that want something to eat after shopping.  So it tends to get busy, plus they won't allow shopping carts inside the restaurant, so you have shopping carts that might get in your way when you're trying to get out.  It does take a tad bit longer to get your food, cause if it is busy, there is a line and hope they're loud enough to call your number cause there's no car hop to deliver your food.  

But the reason why I go here, is cause I love Sonic regardless where the location is.  The food is still the same, just a minor dislike on the location, but I'll still come here for the food.  It's the same as the Drive In.  

If you're a Sonic fan, then it might be a good place to get your Sonic fix, if you're in the area.  As long as you don't mind the shoppers, shopping carts and waiting to get your number called.  You might be luckier than me if you do go.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I don't understand why we can't go into the building and order face to face because that whole speaker-system thing sucks. I wanted to make sure that the waitress got down our order and instead she ended up taking out items and so our order wasn't complete.

The burger was mediocre, probably somewhere down below mcdonalds, in n out, and burger king. The chili cheese fries were decent but the cheese and chili wasn't evenly distributed so alot of it was just regular fries. My boyfriend ordered the reese's blast and it was actually really good, definitely the only thing i make a trip to sonic's for. 

Food's prepared quickly but what do you expect, it's a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Considering its sonic and it's a fast food place it ok, the food isnt bad at all but what I go there for is the sonic blasts and the slushies. I get the butterfinger sonic blast and it is amazing, I also get the strawberry slush and it is way different than any regular slushie, I'm not a fan of slushies but sonic does it right. I also walk by there every day around 6:30 to check out the firefighters that get dinner there. So all in all it a good place."}
{"text":"Sonic!!! Happy hours for drinks - Slushies to go off any diet for - tator tots like those we all grew up eating in school - chili cheese dogs - breakfast all day - loss meals with lots of options - ice cream - drinks with so many combinations much like going to the Jelly Belly factory in Northern California and eating 4 different beans to make an awesome drink!! 

Only negative - broken cars reader machines. Don't use them if they are broken. The location in Surprise off of Reems and Bell had a big issues with their broken card readers a few years ago. A lot of banking accounts were phished and $$ galore was missing. Of its cracked, it's hacked. Have them run it, get a receipt and check your banking often for theft activity."}
{"text":"Worst place ever! I knew this and still tried to come here again I will never ever come back to this location it's horrible just sat there for about 25 minutes for two cheeseburgers, with only two cars ahead of me. I just got home AND OF COURSE MY ORDER IS WRONG!!!! The receipt is correct tho figures! This place needs to just close it's useless..."}
{"text":"The only reason we go to this place is because it's across the street from our house. Drive thru wait times are ridiculous... Usually sitting there 10 minutes before
Getting our food. 

We got some drinks today. My husband got a 32oz iced coffee. He drank it all within 5 minutes and said it probably was all ice and only 5oz of actual coffee. My son had a lemon lime slush, and there was no syrup! He had all slushy ice and no flavor. If we had time, we would have gotten our money back.... But I was not in the mood to wait in the drivethru for 10+ minutes again....

I will say I come here pretty often for drinks and breakfast burritos some mornings. The manager lady during that time is awesome, and knows me by my order. She's awesome, but any other time, it's a lost cause."}
{"text":"Dear Sonic,

  Why all the commercials in Los Angeles when the only place I have EVER seen you is in Arizona?  

I love Sonic.  It's a great fast food place, with classic drive up windows and servers that come and skate your order to your car.  Their fries are always crispy and salty the way I like them and their chicken strips are exactly what they need to be.

They always seem to have some sort of milk shake for any occasions, such as Valentine's (raspberry/cherry) or St. Patrick's Day (mint).  I wish they would open a Sonic over here because I can't think of any reason in the near future to go back to Arizona."}
{"text":"Sonic is the greatest fast food chain in existence. We here in Chicago are still waiting for them to open up franchises and they cannot open soon enough for me. I just recently took a trip to visit the U of I campus and stopping at Sonic for lunch was definitely on the itinerary. Good food, good prices, good service. You cannot ask for more. Plus they have cherry limeade, possibly the greatest drink ever concocted. I bought a RT44 (their biggest size drink) of cherry limeade just so I could sip it for the entire drive back to Chicago."}
{"text":"I like getting a breakfast burrito from Sonic before work, but this is the SLOWEST Sonic I have ever been to. Maybe the slowest drive-through fast-food ever, and the annoying thing is that it's ALWAYS slow. I often see cars waiting in the drive-through just drive away before getting their food because the wait is so long. It doesn't stop me from coming here because I love the breakfast burritos, but I sure don't come here very often because of it."}
{"text":"Why would anyone take the time to write a review about a drive thru burger joint? I mean, they're a dime a dozen, right? Well, for my money Sonic Drive Thru is a cut above most of the other chain burger places that line our streets. The burgers at Sonic are always fresh and made to order and the variety of burgers to choose from is quite extensive. A lot of the big chains have to slather their sandwiches with secret sauce or condiments to hide how dry they are. This isn't the case at Sonic. Their burgers are always juicy and full of real beef flavor. These are the kind of burgers that you have to hunch over to eat or you end up with a stained shirt. That's how a burger should be. 
  The fries at Sonic are fried to crispy perfection and the serving sizes are generous. Sonic's onion rings are easily the best at any burger place I've ever been. They are always hot and fresh with a perfectly crunchy fried shell. They are heaven. 
  This part of my review may sound a little odd, but Sonic has the best fountain Coke I've ever had. Now you may say that there isn't any difference from the Coke at one place or another, but Sonic has to be tweaking their Coke in some way. The first time I took my wife to Sonic I told her how good the Coke was compared to other places. She thought I was nuts until she tasted it for herself. She was hooked. If anyone knows their secret I'd like to know. Sonic's milk shakes are also worth the extra calories. They always have an assortment of specialty shakes for different seasons and holidays and they are always delicious. Sonic no longer has one of my favorite treats on their regular menu: the Cream Pie Shake! These were available in banana, chocolate and coconut. The Cream Pie Shake do occasionally pop up on the menu in a variety of flavors and if they are being made when you stop by, they are a must. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love sonic had a great burger and the staff was very friendly I actually kept making them refill my drink but they were more than happy to assist me"}
{"text":"It's not healthy, it's fast food. Eat it if you want...just don't eat it everyday!

Sonic is awesome! They have a huge selection of items, will customize anyway you want on nearly any item. The best part, even with all that, it's really not too expensive.

This particular store was one of the fastest I have ever been to. My usual thing is to order, bring out my laptop, and start some work. My computer wasn't even done booting up when I saw the girl walking up towards my truck... WOW. The food was awesome and tasted great - exactly like I like it, it all the glory that is unhealthiness, and ya... I go LARGE SIZE! (smile). 

Cherry Lime-aide (don't get the diet), deep fried cheesecake nuggets (don't forget the caramel!), double burgers with cheese and jalapeño's, watermelon slushee, jalapeño poppers, onion rings, and don't forget the SWEET POTATO FRIES! -- the list goes on.... great tasting food that you should not eat everyday."}
{"text":"My bf and I went through the drive thru around 9:30pm. They took FOREVER! I could clearly see the manager sitting and goofing off with the other employees (including her there were 5 I could see) and she was actively engaged in shooting the breeze instead of paying any attention to customers. The guy helping us was super abrupt and really seemed not to care about the extended wait. He was more interested in bumping his crotch against a female coworker (I wish I were kidding, but I'm not). He was pretty rude, too. I got the new croissant dog and while the bun is advertised as buttery and flaky and it was a regular doughy hot dog bun. It was not good. Usually I love Sonic but I'm sorely disappointed. This one is right near my house and I doubt I'll ever go back there. It was an awful experience."}
{"text":"Sonic Drive Inn Will Do In A Pinch


Sonic Drive-In is is a fun place to visit. Sonic  has waitpeople that roll up to your vehicle on rollerskates to serve your meal. 

Sonic\"s food is average like many other fast food establishments.  However, Sonic has \"tattor tots\", and who doesnt enjoy an occasional tater tot.  In addition, to tater tots Sonic has hot dogs, hamburgers, fries, onion rings, breakfast items and so much more.

So if the kids are hungry Sonic can satisfy in a pinch. 

I almost forgot 1/2 price shake after 8... and the shakes are great."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and have had great service and fantastic food! 

I love the ambience of SONIC...it reminds me of the old drive-ins on Happy Days. It brings that feel-good vibe, along with good times, great food, awesome friends, cruising, and listening to the tunes."}
{"text":"Been to this location many times & enjoy it...but the one drawback is the fact that friends of mine who have to pay for their order using half cash & half card (whenever it's all they have available at the time) cannot because Sonic claims their system is not able to, yet they did it once for a friend of mine on a past visit. 

Despite this issue, Sonic has really good menu items to please everyone & for those who join their Text club, Sonic offers great deals. That's the way to go!"}
{"text":"Sonic is one of my favourite places to eat because of the good, friendly service. They are pretty reasonable pricewise as well and you can either go through their drive-through or park and have your food delivered by rollerskating waitresses and waiters. Also, you can park and walk up to their window and order and eat at an outdoor table. I recommend that BEFORE the temperatures reach triple digits here in Arizona!

They have delicious choices on their menu and lots to choose from when ordering something cold to drink. They offer Happy Hour Drink Specials each day from 2:00 to 5:00 pm, so if you're jonesing for a Route 44 OZ Coke Zero to quench your thirst and you're in the area during those times, you can go get 1/2 off on that drink. 

The only drawbacks are trying to get in there coming eastbound on Elliot Road, & I am not crazy about their breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"The limeade is premium fast food trashy fun.  The foot-long coney fills the void with a soft bun soaking up the chili and the frank is a pork & beef mix like it should be, not the hard dry all-beefs that people seem to always want (Hebrew National excepted).  Soft serve with blended-in extra stuff.  Staff is fast and friendly. This is all the fast food classics and I like it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sonic in the whole wide world especially when you're in Vegas visiting they're open 24 hours stampy's great the food is consistent and given all the Vegas football you couldn't ask for a better price is a reasonable"}
{"text":"These guys had no clue that they have happy hour shakes.. even though it's advertised !! Total mess! No clue!! Had to call neighboring Sonic"}
{"text":"1st Time they messed up on my order and were supposed to \"Redo\" my shakes... guy literally wiped off who cream with the top lid! Disgusting ! Upon calling 
The manAger she replaced everything which was great! I wanted to add more shakes and missed their happy hour 1/2 off by 22 minutes and was told that since they had replaced the previous order, they can't also help me with missing the 22 min cut off ! 

Almost a satisfied client!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy the Sonic franchise. Their mozz sticks might be the best on the planet, always seem to be absolutely perfect. My normal order usually consists of the mozz sticks and some sort of burger, usually the cheeseburger toaster minus lettuce and tomato and pickles.
I always get some cherry and/or vanilla flavor added to my drink, which is really cheap at 20 cents for 2 or 3 squirts for a large.  The value meal is always a steal too, a vanilla cone for a buck? Can't beat it for the size and amount of ice cream. Total for the sandwich, cheese sticks, large drink, and a vanilla cone for my lady was $10 and some change. Service was fast and friendly, the girl on the skates was easy on the eyes and could move on those skates. I asked for ranch for the sticks and she brought it out immediately. 
thanks again sonic!
4 solid stars"}
{"text":"Went to sonic today for lunch, the food was fast and accurate and who doesn't love the tator tots at sonic? They are always perfect!! I also really like that you can add flavors to your sodas, something you don't see very often. I love cherry and vanilla flavors and always add one to my drink. (Cherry to sprite today)
Overall value is really good, and it satisfied me for lunch. I was in a bit of a hurry and it was quick, like you would expect!"}
{"text":"I live down the street from this sonic , the service is pretty good . The drive thru can take a lil bit . I really enjoy the onion rings from sonic ! The ocean water is a. Other favorite . But this sonic is good . Plus is on my way home from work , and close to home ."}
{"text":"Really bad service!  Drive thru window was closed so I pulled into parking stall to order.  Menu was difficult to read & intercom staticky but placed order anyway.  Tried to use credit card in appropriate slot - not sure if it worked.  Tried to get someone's attention via intercom - no response.  Then got out of the car and went inside to cancel my order - I'd had enough.  When I complained to the staff inside, they were rude - one of them seemed to think it was very funny.

Left here and went to the Sonic on Cheyenne instead - a world of difference! The drive-through was open but I pulled into a stall - the intercom worked very well, I could easily place my order!  Plus, the carhop actually came out and took my credit card for payment and she was very nice about it!

The bottom line - go to the Sonic on Cheyenne, not the one on Lake Mead!"}
{"text":"After waiting about 5 minutes for some tator totts about 5 of the workers were gathered by the door, one of the workers shouted at a car and yelled  \"and tell your bitch to stay out of Q's inbox\" it was pretty chill. Then about 15 minutes we asked about our tots and they brought them out about 3 minutes after that. All in all not a great experience."}
{"text":"Mmmhmm. Sonics after the club, haha ain't that something. Sonic is nationwide. If you never had it, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Thought I would take advantage of sonics text offers... Went to this location and the cashier had no idea how to take my order, messed it up twice. I only ordered two orders of mozzarella sticks ... Shouldn't be that hard. I then spoke to a manager who messed up my order yet again. Didn't know what  she was doing and wouldn't admit they made a mistake..a horrible customer service. Please don't go to this sonic."}
{"text":"I think I am beginning to outgrow Sonics now that I am no longer an undergrad college student. Their food is meh although I keep going back for their drinks.

// SERVICE // This location is not a drive-in, but actually a drive through like any other fast food place. The server still brings your food out to your car though as oppose to handing it through a window

// FOOD // 

     + Strawberry limeade: My go-to drink at all Sonic's. Fizzy, tart, and topped with chunks of real strawberries. 
     + Tater tots: My other Sonic's fave. Not all fast-food eateries offer tater tots so I always order these to as a throwback to my elementary school days
     + Breakfast Burrito: Hearty, although nothing to write home about. This Sonics currently has a promotion for a breakfast burrito and drink for $2.99."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service at this location tried to order the new ultimate chicken club sandwich and they told me no they are out of chicken can someone please explain why a manager would allow them to run out of chicken and why hasn't the manager fix the issue by going and grabbing some from another location save your self the headache and go to another location all together I will never return to this location again"}
{"text":"I love the onion rings and the carhop service.  The young men and women are always smiling and that puts me in a good mood.  Keep it up!  The drive-thru service needs work, they are kind of slow taking orders sometimes mostly the guys who are on the other end."}
{"text":"So one night me and my family had an urge for a candy slushee from Sonics just like the ones we got when on vacation in Tennessee and Georgia last year.  So we decided at 8:30 pm were going to Sonics in Wexford.  We pulled up in the stall and looked at the menu and when your ready to order you hit the red button, after that you pay by credit card at the car kiosk or when your server brings your food you can pay cash at that time.  We got the bogo free boneless wings in honey bbq and Asian sweet chili, I got a small blue raspberry slushee with nerds, my daughter got a medium brownie and cookie dough madness master blast, and her friend got a small heath Sonic blast.  All in all I love their slushees, and their Sonic blasts are tasty to so my daughter says.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ya know, it's Sonic.  They've some decent prices (wishing they had more dollar items myself, but hey....) and their food is often decent to good.  I can't see Sonic ever getting a 5 star review in the local magazines but for fast food, it's pretty good.  

Just sorry they dont have carside service at this one."}
{"text":"Number 2 super sonic double cheeseburger with extra mustard. Tots and my favorite strawberry slush. This sonic never gets it wrong. Very friendly staff and quick service too."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for sometime. We use to park, but we bring our dog, he's slightly anti social. So, we go through the drive thru. The service this time as a Yelper was actually quite decent, they were courteous and helpful and very timely, unlike most of my dealings in the past.
  They have also removed some of the order boards for the drive thru orders to be able to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Stopped to get breakfast today at 7:15am but again the place was closed even though the sign said it was open. Drove around 3 times and stopped at the drive thru and pick up window but no one inside. Was told by corporate management several months ago a new district manager was hired and we would see a turnaround at this location. Not so. I am going to petition our city council to close this place as it doesn't open when it says and has horrible service. We don't need this place in our community."}
{"text":"They had a sale.  A buck for a chili dog.  So, OK, let's try it.  That's a cheap meal!

Well, it's cheap for a reason.  I didn't really expect much, and it didn't really meet my expectations.  The buns were limp.  Not really soggy, but not really airy either.  Sort of halfway between a normal bun you'd buy in the grocery and a soggy bun (like these would be after about half an hour with chili on them, I'm sure).

The taste was fine.  About what i expected.  But for fast food it wasn't very fast, and wasn't really of the quality one would get at other fast food places.  And fast food places aren't known for quality!

Don't succumb to the lure of a special offer.  Just drive on by and find someplace else."}
{"text":"Came after work to grab an ocean water for my niece and omg it took them seriously 20 minutes! Some girl came to give me my drink and took my card but what was the point of that if I still had to wait in this drive-thru line. Anyways I don't want to come back to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"SLOW. Every Sonic I've ever been to is slow. We order and the people rush to get off the order system with us and then take 15-20 minutes just to bring a drink, mini onion rings, and two coneys. On top of that, I had to use the restroom and there were no toilet seat covers, no soap, and no hand sanitizer. Makes you think their food is nasty too and unclean. Then they only have one person on his skates delivering the food. FUCK YALL."}
{"text":"They need to hire more staff for the rush every time I come here after 8 or around dinner time the line takes me at least 20 minutes. Rediculous. Sonic desserts and drinks are the best but the wait needs to be fixed."}
{"text":"Why are the employees here so rude? It seems every sonic I go to these days the workers just absolutely hate their lives. This one is the worst offender. We order our food from the very unfriendly squeaky person and then pull up to the pick up window... Where we we don't get a \"hello\" or anything. Just a \"23.95\". We give them our payment she gave us the receipt says nothing and shuts the window..Ooook... Then we wait about ten minutes for three cheeseburgers. She then again opens the window, says nothing and proceeds to hand us two bags... And then goes to shut the window.. I say \"is that all?\" She gives me a snotty look and says \"that's all.\" Not a single thank you or have a nice night or even a come again. There are hundreds of different fast food places in Arizona. Most of which can make a burger just as \"decent\" as Sonic. IF Sonic would like to keep their business, I would suggest hiring some employees that give a damn."}
{"text":"By the time they got the order right, the food was cold. Avoid this place until they hire a coherent staff."}
{"text":"Crinkle cut fries and a delicious burger on a sunday afternoon before heading back home! 

I would have given Sonics 5 stars however they need more locations in cali...anahiem and bakersfield is too far! That or cut down the dang commercials..makes the craving go up 10 notches and lord know im not going to drive 2 hours to get a burger!"}
{"text":"I've never waited in a drive thru so long. 2 People behind us got their order first. We orders 2 shakes and 12 wings. Wings were drenched in WAY too much sauce. When we finally got our wings we were given no ranch which we asked for when we ordered. Went in to talk to them manager looked like he was high on drugs. We were given our ranch and he said that the workers should have told us there was a long wait. Nothing was given to us and no sorrys were said. Will NEVER go there again.  TERRIBLE service."}
{"text":"Burgers....cold! Fries...cold! Onion rings....cold and with some kind of sweet, vanilla tasting flavor. If you can't get hot food at 5:30 pm...when can you?
A short review but that's all there is to say."}
{"text":"The worst sonic ever. Not only were they not busy. They forgot my number 6 and also order an order of fries and literally got only 14 fries. The am carton was only half way filled. It's  ridiculous. Not to mention I live 15 minutes away. Bull shit.i"}
{"text":"I came here after watching a pre-screening of a movie with friends. We were undecided on where to go, when this place popped into our minds. It was cheap, fast, and they had some tasty burgers and hot dogs.

Sonic, famous for their shakes and all their commercials with two guys sitting in the car talking about food doesn't really do it quite justice compared to the commercial. Personally, I enjoyed it, except it's not to the point where I will be going to whenever I finish a movie.

Overall, if you're hungry for some quick food (at least when it's not busy) and semi-cheap.. This is the place to go! Plus, it's nice to travel back in time and see how they got down with the roller skater waitresses and the drive in/eating in your car."}
{"text":"We are so done with this place. Sure the food is decent and the drinks are great. But we tire of going there and being told \"we can't give you your order because...\" insert a multitude of excuses. Last night, we went there for ice and was told \"we aren't selling ice tonight\". Hey Sonic, if you can't sell it than take it off your menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped here just for the strawberry lemonade slush during the happy hour time.  The service was fast and all was right, but my wife found something (maybe a leaf) in the drink, but not sure exactly what it was.  I would just recommend the store to pay a little closer attention to the extra scraps going into the drinks."}
{"text":"Sonic Drive-In use to be the GO-TO place when I was in high school because the prices were so affordable and well of course the drinks were good! The food here has never sat well with my stomach so after multiple attempts and not feeling well for days after the fact I thought to myself why even try it again? My stomach says \"No means, No damn it\"! ha-ha. 

Anyways nowadays... the only reason I pay a trip to Sonic is during the half-price shakes after 8PM deals theyrun which come every now and then. Other than that it's a no-go on the food and the customer service is never together. Today my co-worker was raving on and on about the iced coffee's here so I took a chance and decided to see what the hype was about. There is no hype.. Extremely sugary and yeah just glad I only paid $1.07 with one of the coupons that they fill your mailbox with on the weekends. This particular location is and has always been slow! The drive-thru was clear of cars and it literally took almost 10 minutes for an iced caramel coffee? Why? Not sure I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. Had my food ready very quickly. I experienced some issues with the app and paying. A couple employees I spoke to were able to trouble shoot quickly, and brought their manager out. I understand that they aren't tech developers but do appreciate how they were able to find a way to have me pay through the app. The manager and her team were quick on their feet, and provided great customer service! Thanks Sonic N Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times its just OK.. Two other favorite location are on Cheyenne and buffalo as well as the flamingo and Arville location! The half off shakes any time after 8pm is superb! Gotta love their banana ice cream shakes!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I went to Sonic, I will never go back there..They tried to put bbq packs back into my food bag after they fell into  the sidewalk.If I didn't  question  them,  they  wouldn't  have cared. The ground is full of diseases and germs. I told the very young girl that  that was not appropriate.  That this is good I'm feeding my family . They didn't  change  out the bag, not sure what they did, but they took the order back inside and came out with the same bag only with an extra strip. Mind you the bbq packet that was dropped on the sidewalk and put into this bag. was never changed out..Very gross"}
{"text":"Just waited nearly 30 minutes in the drive-thru for 1 shake. The attendant never once apologized for the wait, and when I thanked him and was very cordial to him, he never acknowledged me. Extremely rude and unprofessional. Sadly this isn't the first experience I've had like this here. My wife and I are going to have to find another late night eatery."}
{"text":"Slow. ..fast food shouldn't take 30 minutes! 
Plus they changed the menu and no longer have java chip shakes. . What a shame!  At least I won't have to come back!"}
{"text":"i stopped at Sonic the other night ordered $16 for food just for me asked Mary Jane for ketchup (for my tater tots)she assured me it was in the bag. I gave her a $4.50 tip, midway back to my place i realize there is no ketchup in the bag? I turn around and go back and saw MJ and ask her why there was no catchup in my bag she snapped back at me saying it was not her job to check in the bag to see if there was catchup in it or not I could not believe how rude she was to me I demanded my tip back she threw it at me and I don't know exactly what she said but I know it wasn't friendly terrible service Mary Jane should be fired that was terrible why would she say there's ketchup n the bag and then turn around and say it's not her job to check to see if catchup is in the bag??? totally weird Typical Milleniel unable to own up to any mistakes...."}
{"text":"Sonic is a pretty solid spot to grab a bite to eat or a refreshing drink! I love that they have happy hour for drinks everyday from 2-5 pm and there's so many options, so every time I come here it never gets old! I just realized you can order a slush with jolly rancher crumbs in it! Kinda dangerous and a choking/cutting hazard but really good! As far as food goes I often opt for chili cheese tots, corn dogs, or any of the hot dogs.. all solid options! You can customize just about anything here.. add onions, chilis, peppers etc. 

My tip is for you to sign up for they text program! They often have great perks like .50 dog days, 1/2 priced burgers, and much more!"}
{"text":"Ordered a a sonic blast, a sundae, & a slush at the drive-in. Was slightly busy. However, it took 30 minutes before the screen said the carhop was on the way. 10 more minutes went by & the car hop was still not there. Pushed the button to see what was taking so long & was greeted with a \"Hello welcome to sonic how may I help you?\" Completely forgot about my order. When my ice cream came it was melted. I love sonic but it should never take 40 minutes for ice cream."}
{"text":"Stopped in here to pick up lunch on the way home today. 

To be honest I haven't eaten in a Sonic in forever. So parking at one of their little ordering machines I got out of my car and was about to walk in because I didn't know if I could order food to go while parked at one of their ordering machines. Also I'm sure there is a better name then \"ordering machine\"...maybe ordering station, vending space???? I'm sure if you've ever been to one you know what I'm referring to.

Anyway a young lady comes outside to tell me how a Sonic works. I could order from a machine outside to eat at one of their tables, or I could eat in my car while parked at one of their ordering stations, or they actually have a drive through.  I'm sure she must have wondered what was up with the \"old guy\" who didn't know how a fast food joint worked. Anyway she was kind and polite and did her best not to make me feel like a absent minded \"old guy\"

Weighing my options I decided to use their drive through. I ordered a couple hot dogs. One mustard only and a Chicago style dog. A order of tater tots and a number 1 which is just a classic burger, fries and a drink.

As is typical for a fast food joint it was staffed with a very young group of people. What was not typical for a fast food joint is they actually got my order right.

Food was actually pretty good for a fast food joint. I'm sure when I feel like abusing my body with fast food I'll visit this place again."}
{"text":"Good things are worth waiting for. Every time I come to this location, I have to wait a little while, but it's been never a long time. AND I have to say, it's ALWAYS worth waiting for. The employees are very nice and how can you beat half price drinks during half hour (3pm-5pm)? This is the only one in Vegas that I've been to because I've never had a problem here! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to many Sonics before and I've never been fully satisfied like this location has done for me. All the other ones I've been to are so slow and always mess up my orders! It's not that hard to listen and apply! Well this location on sahara near eastern are very fast and efficient. Even when they might be slammed and the cars in front are holding everyone up. They will walk out to your car in the drive thru lane to collect your money and bring your food to you. They seem to have more of a sense of urgency than most places and that is what keeps me coming back. Also their candied slushes win their way into my heart every time. Other than that I wouldn't come here. Their food is nothing special."}
{"text":"Got a master blast here and the cookie dough was on top but not mixed through. Very disappointing after the great service at Eastern and Windmill."}
{"text":"BEST ICE EVER! At least according to my sister and she is a serious ice connoisseur. No other will do for her. I can't say I notice a difference but I'm not as skilled in the art of ice cubes as she. I can say that in the hot hot summer heat nothing beats a Happy Hour drink from Sonic. Cherry limeade is a classic and should be tried if you have never had one yet. I've strayed off the path to Strawberry Green Tea. I was super excited to learn they make the Strawberry Green Tea just like the Strawberry Limeades and they contain actual pieces of strawberries in the drink! You can get any drink with any of their many flavors so try some different combinations until you find one you like the best. This location does seem to be overrun with customers/under staffed at times but I've only had reasonable wait times. Even if the time was a little on the longer side, the mint on top of that Route 44 drink makes up for it."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service. Out of all the fast food places to eat at I'd pick Sonics any day.  The quality is superb. Try the Onion Rings. I'm not a big fan of onions but their rings hide the taste of onions."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the worst Sonics in town... The wait is extremely long and the customer service needs work. Also double check your bank statements because on two occasions my bank account was double charged... First time I thought it was a mistake but I know I definitely won't be returning..."}
{"text":"The service here was pretty quick, and the food excellent.  But the lady.on the speaker acted like she didn't know how to suggest different menu options,  I will think about returning to this location."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for happy hour drink specials. I also let their corn dogs for $0.99. They are generally always fast and only takes a few minutes from start to finish to get the food and drinks. If you're in a hurry and want a great price and food during happy hour this is  good."}
{"text":"I don't have an ice machine and I live nearby, so I come here for bags of crushed ice and the occasional slush during happy hour. The staff is cool. It's just a pain in the neck exiting the parking lot onto Warm Springs with the never ending construction! Ugh"}
{"text":"Expensive, sandwiches are average quality.  Service is good but that's it. They even charged us for a cup of water ... 60cents!  We won't be going back to Sonic."}
{"text":"This is the sonic that I have grown up going to but this past year it has taken a major downhill plunge. There have been several times where I have gone for just a drink or a corndog or even a bag of ice and it has taken 30 minutes even when I'm the only one there. Tonight though was the last straw. My family and I came to get a sweet treat. We ordered two shakes, two blasts, and a frozen lemonade. We kept getting told to \"hold on\" while ordering. When we finally got everything ordered and pulled up to the window (about 10 minutes later) it seemed like maybe their system was down or something. I know how frustrating and embarrassing it can be when this kind of thing happens so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. The lady who was helping us was very friendly and nice and even joked with us for minute. We got one of our blasts almost immediately and then were told that everything else would be out right way. A couple of minutes went by and we got our frozen lemonade. At this point I notice a man get out of his car at the parking spot and go up to the employees (I'm assuming to ask about his order) he then returned to his car and a few minutes later an employee walked out with his food. For my position at the drive-thru I could see three employees just standing around talking. Another girl came to the window and tried to hand us a bag of food after probably another 10 minutes of waiting. After to informing her that we didn't order any food she quickly closed the window and within the next couple of minutes we had the rest of our shakes and blasts. It seemed quite obvious to us that they had completely forgotten about us and the rest of our order. To top it off they messed up on of our shakes and one of blasts but we didn't even notice until after we had driven away. The service here is NOT prompt and the people who work here seem more interested in their social lives then the customers. I do hope they get their act together quickly otherwise I will have to find a different Sonic to go to."}
{"text":"Did you see the pic of the burnt bread? No thank you. You know they saw that..."}
{"text":"I waited for 30 minutes in the drive thru!! Worst service ever for this Sonics! This location sucks! DO NOT COME HERE!!! I am so pissed!!"}
{"text":"This Sonic is horrible. We go semi frequently and any time we order more than just a drink or two, they screw the order up. The staff is unfriendly and generally give the impression that they really don't care about doing a good job. The owner needs to take some action to straighten out the service."}
{"text":"I love Sonic, but I am continually disappointed by the location closest to my home. The service is terrible, the orders always arrive incorrect/missing items, and the food can take up to :20 minutes in the drive thru. Tonight, after a :17 minute wait, the car behind me received their order first. Zero communication from the staff. Another :10 minutes later, I arrived at home only to discover my tots were burned and half of my cheddar peppers were missing. This was definitely my last visit to this location."}
{"text":"So I just stopped by this sonic and ordered a ice cream sundae. I waited what seemed to be forever just to have my order taken. The guy finally delivers it to me 17 minutes later and hands me the ice cream and a straw. I asked him what's this? Can I have a spoon? And he tells me that they ran out of spoons.. How can a drive up ice cream place not have any spoons? Go to Wal Mart, it's two blocks away and buy some spoons. Or at least let the people know that you are spoonless when they are ordering."}
{"text":"how exactly do you screw up a grilled cheese sandwich? the cheese is black! you took your sweet time to make it (18 minutes to be exact).... for the drive thru."}
{"text":"If you think of sonic think of fake. This place has the worst milkshakes in the history of milk shakes. Trust me it was horrible. There was no chocolate in the thing. Sonic has definetly lost my support. Chocolate milk or just plain milk has earned the title of milkshake in the world of sonic. If you want a shake from sonic, just get milk from your refrigerator."}
{"text":"They must only hire inept people here that don't have any common sense. Ordered a popcorn chicken combo & ended up giving me snack sized. Ordered one of those hot dogs that they advertise on the menu and got a chili cheese dog. Only good thing is I got a large diet coke without ordering one. Not sure what the issue is, but I most definitely will NOT be coming back here. Absolutely ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Sonic is bs.. went up there twice.. and thry still didn't get the order correct.  Asked for a Cranberry Slush and gave me watermelon..TWICE!!! Called there to resolve the situation and was still not able to get it corrected."}
{"text":"SONIC was great!  Where can you get a meal for two for $8?  We ordered the brown bag special,  two burgers with cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, one with tater tots and one with french fries and 2 drinks.  We also ordered a grape creamslush and the worker gave us 2 for the price of one...it was delicious.  We went here several times during our trip and the service was excellent every single time....I wish they had a Sonic in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Takes a while to get your food. Not a big fan of the food once it gets there either. Feels and tastes too processed and the buns taste a bit too sweet. I'd rather go to a McDonalds or Wendy's but luckily for this location they are a bit farther."}
{"text":"We were served a moldy hot dog in my daughters kids meal. The rest of the food was so so."}
{"text":"==Honey, Why Do You Hate That Sonic So Much?==

A tragifarce in one act by Jetta

(Drive-Thru at a Sonic. JETTA, a quirky yet attractive woman in her early twenties, sits patiently in her car as the staff inside hustle and bustle to fill her order. She fiddles with the radio. She checks her polish. She turns the car off. A greasy-faced SONIC EMPLOYEE sticks his head out.)

SONIC EMPLOYEE
Here's your strawberry slush, ma'am.

JETTA
Thank you. Hold on, don't go yet.

(JETTA pops the lid to the slush. The cup is filled ENTIRELY WITH FLAVORLESS ICE.)

JETTA
This doesn't look like strawberry. I think you gave me the wrong flavor.

SONIC EMPLOYEE
No, actually, by this time of the day the slush machines freeze over, and they all come out like that. 

JETTA
Why didn't you tell me that twenty minutes ago when I ordered it?

SONIC EMPLOYEE
Didn't think you would mind.

JETTA
Mind what, being charged a dollar and some change for a cup of blended ice? You knowingly brought this to me and thought it would be acceptable.

SONIC EMPLOYEE
I wasn't expecting you to check it.

JETTA
I want another flavor. 

SONIC EMPLOYEE
Okay.

JETTA
Wait. You're just going to give me another cup of ice.

SONIC EMPLOYEE
The machine's frozen. I told you.

JETTA
Just get me an ocean water. Same size. 

SONIC EMPLOYEE
Sure thing. 

(SONIC EMPLOYEE and JETTA exchange cups. She pops open the lid.)

JETTA
This is coke. Ocean Waters have sprite.

SONIC EMPLOYEE
Sprite machine's out.

JETTA
So you just thought you'd substitute coke and hope I wouldn't notice? 

SONIC EMPLOYEE 
Can I get you something else?

JETTA
Yes. Just get me a coke with some vanilla, cherry, and chocolate flavoring. Please. Thank you.

SONIC EMPLOYEE 
Will you pull up in one of the spaces and wait in the dining area? You're holding up traffic.

(JETTA parks her car and walks over to the dining area. She fiddles with an item in her purse, visibly trying with little success to restrain her anger. SONIC EMPLOYEE steps out with soda, a smirk on his face.)

SONIC EMPLOYEE
A coke with vanilla, coke, and chocolate flavoring for the la-

(SONIC EMPLOYEE, now face to face with JETTA, stops in his tracks. JETTA stands a full foot over him, a sneering face atop mannishly broad shoulders. SONIC EMPLOYEE drops the soda to the floor. JETTA looks down. It was water.)

SONIC EMPLOYEE
Sorry. Wrong order. I'll be right back.

(SONIC EMPLOYEE sheepishly returns with another soda. JETTA opens it in front of them, looking inside. She nods, signaling her minimal satisfaction.)

SONIC EMPLOYEE
Here's your money.

(The SONIC EMPLOYEE hands JETTA a dollar bill and some change. Laughter and stares from the kitchen. The SONIC EMPLOYEE averts his eyes, staring at the spilled cup on the ground below.)

SONIC EMPLOYEE
Have a good day, ma'am. Thank you for your patience.

(JETTA sashays off to her car, sipping happily at her flavored soda. SONIC EMPLOYEE, sulking, returns to the kitchen to ruin someone else's night.)"}
{"text":"I only went here because my kids wanted it.  I read the reviews about wrong orders... They did not disappoint: wrong order. They even screwed up the soda!  I recommend Mugsy's a block away."}
{"text":"This has got to be the slowest pace to eat ever! Sat in the drive thru for 20 min and the line never moved.  At least another 8 cars ahead of us.  Pulled out and left.  If you have a ton of time to kill the milkshakes are great."}
{"text":"I am now on the second call in and I've been waiting about 25 minutes for them to get my order correct. It's not like I'm asking them to commit brain surgery, I'm asking them to make a double cheeseburger. They can't get in order correct. Avoid this restaurant at all costs"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the their milkshakes !!!!!  and they're 24 hrs!!!!  Plus, gotta love their Happy hour specials on slushies !!!"}
{"text":"Being that I am the ruling figure of this establishment, I should draft a review. I dont understand the gripe with this location. I dont think that I have ever waited more than 2 cars. The food is always fresh and my only niggle it that they may be a little skint on the caramel a,d hotfudges and it may take a little polite \"goading\" to get results. Which isn't horrible. They make good custom drinks and they keep the kiddoes happy. Ive been here at wee hours of the morning to very late at night, and service has always been consistently good."}
{"text":"I give up! Every time I go here they mess up my order. I'm in the drive thru forever. And to top it all off they don't know what chocolate ice cream is. 2nd time now they give me vanilla and made me pay extra for it. They even say \"here is your chocolate blast\" when clearly it's vanilla. 
I don't care if every ice cream place is closed and their the only ones open. They won't be getting my business."}
{"text":"I get off work at 3am. I.....am.....starving.  Just finished a 12 hour shift in the er with no lunch break. Crappy night. I drive over to the sonic that is open 24hrs. Pull up to the drive thru. Welcome to sonic, we are currently doing our end of the day something or other and can't take your order because we aren't smart enough to use a calculator to figure up your food cost. Thanks sonic. Thank you for failing. If any of you come into my er I will still serve you because I don't get an hour a night to not do my job."}
{"text":"We don't have a sonics back where I came from so when I drove up it reminded me of those car hops you see on tv.  I drove up to a stall and pushed the button and waited for someone to take my order.  After 5 minutes of waiting I decided that it was just way too hot to sit here in the car so I went to the drive through.  Maybe it's just me since it was my first time at sonics and I didn't know how to work it.  I had to repeat my order several times before she got it right.  Everything else went smoothly.  

After years of watching the sonic commercial I expected more and was a little let down.  I can get better hotdogs elsewhere but i think i may be back to try a shake or a slushie"}
{"text":"Consistently the slowest \"fast food\" I've ever been to. I live right down the street, so I am a continuous customer. The menus great, the drinks are great, I love happy hour. But even when they're not busy, it's SLOW!!! I consistently wait 30+ minutes for just milkshakes.
Another trip here 7 days later: Terrible Sonic that needs to re-evaluate their standards. This is a picture on my milkshake right when they handed it it me - the top tip of the whipped cream didn't even come close to the top of the cup. I am very disappointed by this place's standards and performance. To top it off, this isn't the first time this has happened to me at this location. Waited over 30 minutes in the drive through for this not so \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING. Burger patty was dry as sawdust with a cold, unmelted slice of cheese. Oh and THERE WAS AN ANT IN MY DRINK. HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"I don't know why I bothered wasting my time and money yet again.  I've given this Sonic multiple chances to at least give me decent food but they have failed time and time again.  This time was the last straw.  I only ordered 2 things-- a shake and mozzarella sticks.  Hard to mess those up, right? WRONG. The shake tasted good but the cup was broken on the bottom and it proceeded to leak all over my car. And after waiting for almost 10 minutes, my mozzarella sticks were lukewarm and I got NO DIPPING SAUCE. SO DONE WITH SONIC, COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS!!"}
{"text":"I just go here for iced tea during happy hour.  The microphone on the drive thru doesn't work properly and could not hear him and had to drive to the window to place my order. I'm waiting in line now, thinking I should have went to McDonald's for their iced tea. Much faster service. I feeling postal at the moment. The sheer ineptitude, man. Deep breaths, calm like still water. If you don't finish high school get a job here, I'm sure they will take you. The tea was tasty though"}
{"text":"Ive visited Sonic in the afternoons and at night and man do they get packed! I love their burgers always fresh and the Limeades are Slurplicious. For quicker service go for drive thru. Yes theyre slow but at least they dont slack on the food. So worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"AVOID THIS SONIC. I've never written a Yelp review before but I feel I have to. Over the course of a few months I've gone to this sonic 3 times. Each time they've screwed up reading back my order and I would have to re tell them multiple times. Then I'd get my food and it would be entirely incorrect. Every. Single. Time. Since this has happened over the span of a few months it makes me think this is a managerial issue. They also don't answer their phone so if you want to bring up any complaints or compliments you have to drive over there and ask but most likely get turned down. AVOID THIS SONIC."}
{"text":"Believe me, their food is great. But the customer service is beyond horrendous. I thought I was getting Fast-Food, not a Dine-in service. It took them 30 minutes to even order my food, and I wasnt even gonna order much to begin with.
I love their food, but they need to fix their time management."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if all Sonics are like this one but I hope not. This is the first and only time I've tried Sonic and I must say I was very disappointed. The burger was not even warm. The bread was stale and there was simply nothing good about it. I'm not a picky eater but I didn't even finish the burger. I tossed it halfway through. The tater tots were decent but they also were soggy and slightly warm. The hot dog was nothing special as well. The restaurant parking lot was packed with a biker group being overlooked by a few cops. With so many people in the parking lot you would think they'd be serving up some fresh food.  

The strawberry slush was the best part of the meal since it had small pieces of real strawberries. But mostly just full of sugar and water. We never went back and probably will not. I heard some of their restaurants in the midwest are much better. Maybe I'll give them a try next time I head out that way."}
{"text":"You want to know what the lamest thing in the world is ????

ALL THE GOD DAMN SONIC COMMERCIALS IN SEATTLE, WHEN THE CLOSEST ONE IS OVER AN HOUR AWAY...HORSESH**...

Well the other night to my amazement I saw a Sonic drive in and I had to stumble over and try. Hot damn was it a disappointment...they discontinued the cheesecake bites!! WTF?!? And to rub salt in the wound...damn waitress says \"oh too bad those were delicious, you missed out!\"....freakin' hooker...sorry but I love me some cheesecake! Tried out a wrap and the bacon burger...they were just so so...would rather had a Sourdough Jack from Jack in the Box. Only real good thing to get here are their slushy drinks."}
{"text":"Your manager Travis was absolutely great. He even made a suggestion that would save me money. Thank you Travis. He was polite, funny, and has great customer service, good job sonic for hiring such a wonderful person top represent your store."}
{"text":"Ok this is getting old. The price have gone way up and you definitely don't get what you pay for any more. Charged for cheese tots large. Got this crap. It's bee happening more and more at this location. Does anyone over their age of 20 work or manage there. Cause the ones you have don't seem to care."}
{"text":"So I like the idea you can sit inside and eat and you don't have to eat in your car that's the only reason for the stars.  First the bathroom was a mess. No soap no paper towels or hand sanitizer, gross!!!. Now the food was sonic food so there is no need to say anything about the food. But while the tables area complete wreck. Dried ranch on one of them trash on at least 4 out of 8 of the tables I saw. None of them looked like they have been wiped down all day. The phones you order on look like they have been cleaned in years. But the manager and employees have time to bs and goof off. Good job children. Oh and I guess the little manager type has a very important phone call since he has been walking around on his personal phone for 15mins. But hey why would you want to do the job you get paid to do?? It's sad that these kids have no idea what work actually is"}
{"text":"I used to love the slushies and travelled  a distance to to get here but they don't make them the same anymore....too watery! Love the potato tots and burgers but I can get the same anywhere  closer to home!"}
{"text":"Fast service! Nice workers. & great products! Love the corn dog & blue raspberry candy slush."}
{"text":"This location does not give refills even if you spend $100 in one transaction and tipped the carhop"}
{"text":"Been to this location once. I would come back. I ordered the NY hot dog. It's 100% beef with sauerkraut, spicy mustard and fried onions. I love sauerkraut. The service was okay. I had to tell the order taker my order a few times. And the person who brings out the food threw away my receipts so I made him dig them out the trash because he just assumed that I didn't want them. The food was hot. They didn't give me enough ketchup packets for my onion rings though. Typical fast food place with areas they can improve in with appropriate feedback."}
{"text":"I used to have a soft spot for this sonic because it was next to my alma mater. However, recently I just can't. I ordered a grilled cheese a week ago and it was covered in onions. First of all I have a severe allergy to onions and second, when the hell does a grilled cheese come with onions on it? Thank god for Benadryl or I'd be dead."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much to begin with, since this IS Sonic, but holy shit it was bad. 

Imagine, we made this out last trip before leaving Vegas and we were unpleasantly surprised. The order taker, Sandra, had absolutely no class. Maybe it wasn't entirely her fault because she could barely hear out of the drive thru speakers I was YELLING at. But still. The way she responded to my questions and orders was still pretty rude. 

We ordered the chicken crap and the burger crap. We didn't really pay attention to the menu items cause homegirl with her 2002 Kelly Clarkson highlights didn't pay much attention to us. Bye."}
{"text":"I forgot how much I like sonic.  I got the burger and my mum got the cheese steak sandwich.  Her sandwich was really good.  I love the tots now yum!!  We also got a salted carmel shake and a fresh banana shake and they were amazing... :)"}
{"text":"I should have been born in the 40's so I could have been a teen in the 50's. I wish there were more drive-in type of places to eat at, not that I have anything bad to say about Sonic. 

It had been a while since I have been to a Sonic, and it's just something fun. Double burger and a route 44 ocean water. Good stuff!!! Plus you can get tater tots....where else can you do that? I will say that mayo on a burger is not my thing, but if you don't want it you don't have to have it.

Also, I know it's fast food and all the server is doing is walking out to your car, but it's Arizona and it's 110 degrees out. Give your server a dollar! It wont kill you, and it's better then giving a dollar to someone on the side of the street who refuses to work, but expects your hard earned money for nothing."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Sonic in over a year, but after today may never return. I ordered my food and then asked for water. I was advised that it would be an additional $.40 for a small water. SERIOUSLY!!!! I contacted corporate and they said this is something new they have started. They noted my concern. Thanks, but no thanks. I was not offered any compensation for my inconvenience."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Sonic and relish the opportunity to sit peacefully in my car and grub on some quality food. This Sonic did not disappoint! My order was correct, and brought out super fast, probably the fastest I've ever had at any Sonic! Brooke, who took my order, was courteous and pleasant. Mario, who delivered my order with a smile, was the same. It was truly refreshing to see some people who actually enjoy their jobs! I had the Super Sonic Double Cheeseburger combo, with onion rings. I tried their new Sonic Fruit Fizz Sparkling Water in Peach-Strawberry: not too bad, could've had a bit more flavor, as I thought it was kinda bland. I'll ask for more pumps next time. It was made with fresh strawberries, though, so it was a nice touch. 
The grounds are very well maintained and clean. Under canopy dining area was well lit and clean also. While I was eating, Mario even checked in on me and asked how everything was, and if I needed anything else. I've NEVER had this happen at a drive in before. My sincere compliments to the management for instilling in their crew what great customer service should be like! I will so be back!"}
{"text":"Big fan of the watermelon Ice cream slush. nothing more comforting than a chili cheese footlong coney even if you have to pay for it later. 
They have good chicken sandwiches and I love the sonic tv commercials lol. Yay for sonic !"}
{"text":"I forgot about my previous review which makes this even better. Well, I guess I'll be eating mozzarella sticks with barbecue sauce from my fridge tonight because they didn't give me what I paid for. Thanks, anyway."}
{"text":"Daniel was awesome. He was very helpful and kind and courteous. He is a great asset to the sonic on Cheyenne. The company has amazing food and a great happy atmosphere"}
{"text":"Sick and tired of these idiots. They don't freaking listen. I wanted s route 44 frozen lemonade. Dude called back a medium lemonade.  Corrected him with said orfer again. Says sorry and drink will be $1.75. Pay for the drink then get it. No way it's heavy enough to have their slush mix in it. I took it because I didn't have time to piss around saying it's not what I ordered and for them to do it right. 

BUYER BEWARE at this place. They just don't care."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences. The corn dogs were very doughy as if they weren't even fried, the French fries seemed as if they had been made many hours ago. I would never recommend this location. Worst sonic ever. You would think with so many employees working there they could at least get the food decent. Never again."}
{"text":"Food was decent. What you'd expect from a far food joint. Actually the bacon cheeseburger and Oreo shake were quite tasty, but I'm docking a star because I walked in (maybe my fault for doing this at a restaurant known for being a drive in) and found the experience very strange. Instead of ordering at a counter like a normal place, I sat alone in a separate room where I had to place my order through a greasy phone on the wall. I guess this is to simulate the drive in experience? It failed. Other than that, fine place."}
{"text":"We had a minor issue with our meal, one of our items was left out. We contacted the server, Blake, who was awesome about getting the order fixed. He brought out a fresh item, a couple coupons, and even brought a bowl with water for our dogs to enjoy while we ate. He made what would have normally been a frustrating situation into an impressive display of customer service. Kudos."}
{"text":"the food is good however they made me wait a fairly long time and that is unexceptionable they should never make me wait an hour my advice is to check the amount of people there then decide if you will eat there"}
{"text":"The last few times I have been here the service has been PAINFULLY slow. And I only come here to buy bags of ice and apparently they do not offer this anymore? As far as I'm concerned that is the only reason to go to Sonic. Because it sure cannot be for their high quality good or amazing customer service. Unless you want to wait forever for crappy food that will give you explosive diarrhea and probably make you 400 pounds, do not come here. You guys SUCK!"}
{"text":"The service at this location is really, really slow. I stopped here for a quick drink on the way home. They have tons of drink selections and syrups, even some sweetened with splenda. Unfortunately, my vanilla coke was flat. Great tater tots though."}
{"text":"Sonic used to have a lot more food items on their menu. These days they're focusing mainly on the drinks. Which is fine by me. Milk shakes, slushes, limeades, and more. A few burgers and snacks round out the menu. Service is always on the slower side here, but the car hops are always friendly and will even come back and check on you later. Plus they have a happy hour every day, with buy one get one drinks. 

I've never been a fan of the burgers, but the toaster sandwich is really good, and the tater tots are among the best."}
{"text":"Extremely terrible service! 
Tonight I pulled up to the drive thru,waited 5 min at the box, kept saying hello, no answer. Was in the middle of looking up the number to call, when a girl came out with boxes. I asked her if the drive thru was closed. Mind you when I pulled up, this same chick was at the dumpster and walked past my car to go back inside. I told her I had been there for 5 min, she walked back on and magic A guy finally greets me. I ordered a vanilla malt cookie dough blast. That was it. He my total was almost $8. I pull up, and I'm thinking that's extremely expensive. They walk out with 2 drinks, I inform them I ordered only one. I repeated my order, the manager comes out and confirms I cancelled the shake I didn't order, I again repeat my order. The guy comes back out with a drink, and realizes he didn't fix the price, so goes back insides, comes back out, tells me the new price, it's been 10 min now on one drink, I give him a $5, I ask him if he's really going to charge me for the complete shitty service, I asked for the manager, he goes back inside. I look at the receipt, and they still had my drink wrong. The manager comes out, i told him to give me my money back their service was shit, and that they still had my drink wrong. I then repeated my order and showed him my receipt. I also said I was upset I had been waiting as long as I had, for one drink. He didn't even offer to give the less than $3 drink for free! He went back inside, and had the other guy bring out my money. Seriously terrible fucking service!"}
{"text":"Their half price shakes aren't really half price! I have gone here several times for the half price shakes after 8pm. Every time I order the same thing and it is a different price pretty much every time, but never half price. I'm not sure why they claim to charge half price when it's more like you are paying 3/4 the price. I have asked the manager himself why I am being charged more than I should and he claimed that half price for $7.28 was $4.36 including tax. It should be $3.64 plus tax. Even if the tax was 10%, the most I should be paying is $4.00. I find it very frustrating to the point I wouldn't go back if it weren't for my kids because I know their math doesn't add up but they won't admit that they are overcharging me. The shakes themselves are pretty good but beware if you order chocolate because they add chocolate syrup to vanilla ice cream to make chocolate and sometimes it just looks like a slightly darker version of the vanilla."}
{"text":"Sonic . . . so good for dessert!  They also have a happy hour between 2-5 p.m. where drinks are half off.  Includes the limeaid."}
{"text":"I hope this review finds somebody planning to go to Sonic and successfully sways them away. I'm pressing the zero stars as hard as possible, but it won't let me.

How this place messes up hot dogs and tater tots is beyond me. I'm not sure how the food is so abysmal since everything seems to be microwaved 2 weeks prior to you ordering it.

You can get better hot dogs at a gas station. Craving a milkshake? Go to Steak n Shake. Want greasy, comfort food? Try Happy Moose.

You would have better luck finding better food at the Big Boy restaurant that has been closed for years.

Unless you lost a bet or some other unfortunate turn of events that force you to come here against your will, stay far, FAR away."}
{"text":"Professional & courteous, and tasty shakes! We always have a great experience at Sonic - a frosty place for treats in the middle of the desert!"}
{"text":"for my first time trying sonic after watching all those freakin commerical on tv here in the bay area.....i had to try it.  cherry limeade and the strawberry limeade was refreshing...slightly carbonated.  tater tots!?!?!  napoleon dynamite would love this place!  pretty good..not like those frozen ones you got in ur grade school lunch...i donno what it is....great option to fries.  their burgers were pretty good and so was the popcorn chicken.  luckily i had some friends with me so i can try different things.

kinda cool old style drive up burger joint...and the dude was on roller blades...classic.  he actually dropped one of our drinks tho.

mcdonalds still has the best fries...but nobody has tots like sonic."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here, they're VERY slow and the food orders are always wrong, I can't even count how many times I've ordered a burger without tomato and onion only to find out when I get home that they're onions on it, and being allergic to onions this is no joke. This happened TODAY YET AGAIN..I wish I could give this place zero stars honestly."}
{"text":"yah! I'm honored to be the first reviewer for sonic. this was one of the few things i liked about Arizona. forget about getting lunch here if you do not eat meat. they do have a wonderful drink and dessert section if you have a sweet tooth like me. the peanut butter shakes are good, a plain ice cream cone is good, and if you are trying to watch your weight (which i should be doing), you can get the DELICIOUS diet cherry limeade. during the week, drinks are also all half off!! you can get a super extra large limeade for under a buck! the servers are all very nice too, but i prefer the drive through. all i know is, if i had money, i would open up a sonic in the San Fernando valley. it would be the new in and out."}
{"text":"every time i come to this sonic around 7pm they say \"sorry we can't do blasts right now\" i don't know if there's an issue with their machines almost every time i come but it's just ridiculous and not to mention they are extremely slow no matter what you order."}
{"text":"Always prompt to take your order. Service always friendly and food always comes fast. Tried a crispy chicken sandwich for first time and it looked like dead roadkill that was over cooked LOL but when I brought it in and told them they put lettuce and tomatoes on (I had asked for none) and told them the chicken sandwhich looked a little to scary to eat - they were happy to exchange it for a burger for me. They were very apologetic and helpful. Service was super friendly even after and I had no worry they spit in my burger LOL"}
{"text":"Short waiting time and the order was fast for the amount of food we ordered. Great service and good price range, the food is awesome."}
{"text":"Chick had an attitude. Lots of attitude. Attitude I'm sure she couldn't afford to have. So much attitude she didn't even give back the correct change."}
{"text":"I'm super surprised this location is still in business. You can tell they're doing the bare minimum. If you buy a Sonic blast, don't expect anything remotely close to a \"blast.\" If you want to pay $4.00 for a small cup of ice cream lightly dusted in your choice of candy then this is your place. I'll definitely be going anywhere else for my treats."}
{"text":"I love the coney meal!!! Is there anything on this menu that's bad??? Everything seems to be a slice above heaven!! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"This was my first Sonic experience and I liked it. The cheddar poppers were good and so we're the chilli dogs and the New York dog.  I also had the Oreo and chocolate milkshakes which were made with real ice cream and were delicious but very thick.  One pleasant surprise is that I am pretty sure they use real eggs with their breakfast sandwiches which would make this the best fast food restaurant to get breakfast at, in my opinion. Little things like that go a long way. The staff was also very nice and provided prompt service."}
{"text":"I just made a trip to this location this afternoon. There was 4 cars ahead of me in the drive thru. I placed my order (three drinks) and had to repeat my order three times! Waited about 10 minutes then I finally got to the window. The lady at the window asked if I got a hot dog and drink. I said no and told her what I ordered again. I paid and waited another 10 minutes for my drinks. All the drinks were wrong! After waiting so long I decided to just take what was given to me and left. I got home and noticed that one of the drinks I had gotten wasn't even full and I was only given one straw. I also took a closer look at my receipt and noticed I had gotten charged for a fourth drink! I probably won't go to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Love the drive up waitstaff on skates experience! They have happy hour specials with deals on drinks. I recommend the Cherry Limeade, so good, like a Shirley temple with a kick of lemonade added in."}
{"text":"Fair prices. Decent service. Ever since I tried sonic back in 1997 I have loved there food. They keep coming out with new items to keep things fresh. My only complaint is their ice cream machine breaks down a lot."}
{"text":"This sonic is the worst one ever because of the time it takes to get the food. I've been here for 30 mins waiting for 1 grilled chicken wrap. It's absolutely ridiculous. Go to another sonic"}
{"text":"The food and  the shakes are good on happy hour .came here for President Day hot dogs that are a dollar very good"}
{"text":"This location has staffs on roller-blades when you order at the park-ins.  it's quite cute and I have never had a bad experience.

I love their cherry limades.  I suggest getting it with ice, not slushi for two main reasons:  the diameter of the straw is not meant for efficient slurping; and when the ice melts, it dilutes your drink.  I also love their chili cheese hot dogs and chili cheese tots.  I overheard someone at a baseball game raving about the coconut creme pie milkshake - apparently it's a must-try!"}
{"text":"Yup! It's a typical Sonic's Drive-In.... but wait! Why do the staff here seem so much friendlier? I'm not sure, but go ahead and keep serving me that cherry limeade with a smile and a pep in your step! Love this location!"}
{"text":"i think it might be a california thing, but i like my slushes a bit icey.... they are more like a slurpee here, overblended and watery... they didnt even fix it after we asked for a replacement. fail"}
{"text":"Just went through the drive-thru. 45 minutes with just 6 cars ahead of me. Ridiculous! $12.46 for 3 small blasts. Way overpriced. Weren't filled to top of cup and candy barely sprinkled on top. Next time I'll go to McDonalds down the street."}
{"text":"I love sonic I always have I been going there for years fast service supersonic service good food I love their ice cream to great location clean place clean the restroom"}
{"text":"Stopped to try indoor dining.

Here is how it seems to work.
You come in. 
Try to find a menu if u need one.  I see only 2 here. One on top of trash can, below the cleaning bucket. The other on a couples table. No posted menu.
Pickup phone at your table, push button, then order. I ordered from memory since I did not want the trash can menu.
Phones look dirty. Wonder if they sanitize those.  
I am going to eat in my car cause the vibe in here is weird.  Just me and an employee who must be on break."}
{"text":"Best yummy place for desserts and it's half priced which saves you on money, I've been coming to all sonics since I was a wee little lad, this is probably just as good as any other fast food joint in Vegas in my opinion, deffinently 5 stars and deffinently recommend to anyone if they have a sweet tooth"}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here for a late night snack, and we ended up waiting 20 minutes for a couple corn dogs and some drinks. Food was good but not worth the wait. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of their cheeseburgers; I always get the coney and tots with sweet tea forgetting that they serve a ton of other drinks. At least I'm consistent, yeah?"}
{"text":"5 stars for their milk shakes !!!! Double cheese burger was good. Wished they have indoor sitting dinning."}
{"text":"Usually love sonic but this is ridiculous. I've worked with food and I can tell you that I would never give someone something I wouldn't even eat."}
{"text":"I'll occasionally come here after school to get shakes and I am usually pleased by the service! I've never had anything wrong other than maybe forgetting straws. No complaints!"}
{"text":"The service at this Sonic is sloooooooow. Whether the line is ten cars long or you're the only one, be prepared to wait. Another thing: Sonic's food is not good. I notice the mediocre rating and attribute that to the ridiculously slow service and trash food. So why am I so familiar with this location? The drinks! And that's why Sonic gets an a-ok from me. If you go during happy hour, they are mega cheap. They have an even better special before 10AM in which I think a large is only a buck? My favs are the cherry limeade and the ocean water. They also have lemonades, slushes, floats, and ice cream treats. You can get soda with flavored syrup as well, which is what my Mom typically goes for. I don't drink so Sonic is the place to be for me; after a rough day, I often crave a big old soda and Sonic has always got my back. I've been spending lots of time at this location (literally, because the drive thru is slow) because my pup has been getting laser treatments at the vet just up so the street, so we swing by on our way home. 
I did attempt some food about a month ago, and they got my order wrong. I made the mistake of not checking until I got home. I called the manager (his personal cell is on the receipt which I find a little odd) and he said he'd rectify it by refunding a portion of my meal, which never happened. That left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever waited 25 mins for cold food. They were under staffed .i will never go back to this location"}
{"text":"I just got home from picking up food from here and I must say it was terrible. I opened up my chicken sandwich and I find a piece of hair on it. I know it was not my hair because the sandwich was wrapped up. Then I open it up to see if there was anymore hair in it and the bun is still cold. The chicken doesn't look like it was cooked all the way. I didn't want to go back and complain about it because I'm sure it will only be worse. I do not want them to spit in my food. The only thing I am stuck with eating is my cold tater tots and a snickers blast. Such a waste of money."}
{"text":"I love sonic. I stumbled upon this purely by luck as I was trying to figure out how to kill two hours before an appointment I had down the street. 

Service was prompt, friendly and I paid with my card on the menu screen which made it even easier. Got my food within 5 minutes of ordering. 

Ordered a New York dog no onions, medium chili cheese tots and a Sprite. Satisfied indeed. I mean, it's fast food. It's sonic. You either like it or you don't! 

I have absolutely no complains about my experience here today :)"}
{"text":"Why aren't there Sonics in MA?? It's a great alternative to other fast food, even if it isn't all that much healthier.

We made a stop right before heading to the airport and my breakfast burrito of ham and cheese was simple, but great. And the strawberry smoothie I had along with it really hit the spot. 

The popcorn chicken we saved to eat on the plane was ok, the Toaster chicken sandwich was better, but both probably should be eaten piping hot.

And can I just say - what better idea than to order and have food brought to your car in the winter in New England? Brillant, I'm telling you I should open a franchise!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I FINALLY made it to a Sonic.

Now I never have to go again.

It's not that it's terrible.  It's mostly just \"meh.\"  No better and sligtly worse than other fast food joints (much worse than some).

The burger meat was tasteless.  All I tasted was lettuce.  It's one of those burgers that depends on onions and mayonnaise to have any taste at all, and since I order without both, I got no taste.  The cheddar and jalepenos had no heat whatsover, and the jalepeno came out in one piece on the first bite, leaving breading and Velveeta to contend with.  Having the Tater Tots is a nice touch, but they were limp without any crust at all.

And the whole thing about MAKING you eat in your car is lost on me.  We tried to walk up to order and sit at the few tables they had because I only want to eat in my car if I'm in a damn big hurry.  No go.  You have to order at your car, but they will bring the food to the tables.  After we got our food I started to wonder if we were expected to tip the woman for roller-skaing our food the five feet to us.  Sure enough, I saw other drivers tipping her.  So, what you get free at places like Carls Jr. is going to cost you at Sonic.

Apparently it isn't just me who doesn't get it.  Another guy in a Mini drove up while we were there, walked up to the door and tried to order food.  When he was told he had to order in his car and the food would be brought out, he drove away.

If you think roller-skaing waitresses is cool, go for it.  If you're looking for some decent fast burgers at a chaine, skip Sonic and hit In N Out or Steak N Shake or Carls Jr or Wendy's or, God help me, even Burger King and McDonalds.  Hell, I even think the burgers at Del Taco are tastier.  This is one place where the hype far exceeds the reality."}
{"text":"This is the worst Sonic I have ever been to. The service is super slow, and the employees don't seem to care. The one clerk started talking to another employee about what she was doing after work in the middle of ordering. Twice I have had to go inside as nobody responds to the order button you push from your car. I have been here three times, and it's been like that every time. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tatianna is one of the best drive-thru employee at this sonic, she always has a smile on her face and is always very respectful every time I come and whenever there is a problem with my food or drinks she fixes it with no hesitation love her. THIS GIRL DESERVES A RAISE!!!"}
{"text":"The new store manager, Jamal is amazing!!!! That place has really turned around since he took over. He is so nice and pleasant to be around.
Rock on, Jamal!!!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time trying it. We are very disappointed with Sonic. My cheeseburger was cold when they handed it to me. We ate there it shouldn't have been cold. The lettuce in our hamburgers was not fresh. The hamburger taste just like Burger King hamburgers :-/ It's not worth the money. I gave them 2 stars because the shake was good. If I ever come back it will be for just that."}
{"text":"Stopped in and ordered 4 ice cream shakes, all of them awful!! Myself my mom and my boys ages 13 and 11 who eat everything even threw them away.  I emptied all of the ice creams and there was a white powdery substance in the bottoms  of all. I immediately called to find out what it was when we ordered 'real ice cream' shakes.  Summer who answered the phone informed me they were all made incorrectly.  They were all made like custards- which we didn't order.  Either way they didn't taste good. Waste of a drive:( if I could give a rating less of a rating I would;)"}
{"text":"Well i see no one mentioned this sonic is down the street from the Scottsdale 6 drive-in. I seen one the yelpers wrote that there are not many drive thru sonic's anymore...you are wrong there my friend. If you go down south...Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, etc...you will find plenty of them. This is the only sonic in fact that i have seen made like this one...because this is a rare establishment...but that is what makes it so great. The red phones only exist here...and they fact they have no drive-in is totally wild...but cool as well. 

The menu is full of you classic sonic goodies from the burgers and fries....to the slushes and limeades. The desserts are also the same as are the great tots and footlongs...but the true gem of this place is the indoor seating area once again with the red phones..i simply loved the place. Not to mention once again you can buy your food here for cheap and then take it down to the drive-in movie and your all set for the night...check out the pics this place is a must see. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!"}
{"text":"The Wife and I visited this Sonic today because my wife had a coupon for buy one get one Sundaes. This sonic is very close to where we live...so when we want a sonic treat this is the one we go to. We had 2 hot fudge sundaes and my wife had a sweet tea, and i must say it was the best hot fudge sunday for under 2 bucks that i have ever had. Now that was the good...the reason i only gave it 3 stars though is because the drive up as i call it because it is not a drive-in is awful. The building was not really made for a drive-in...you have to pull up to a designated spot and wait on your order and believe me on a busy day that can be a huge problem.

Sonic has decent food at decent prices...but if you want it fast then you might want to go to another sonic. This one is good for us because it is near by and we don't usually have to wait long...but it is not for everyone..so remember to Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Probably never coming back to this sonic... ever.... food was cold .. I mean I know I ordered at 9:00 am but c'mon... poor service ."}
{"text":"Why review a fast food chain?  For me, this particular Sonic is close to where I work.  Because there aren't many options when pressed for  time I'm able to walk or drive here and grab a quick bite to eat.  Like most fast food chains it's about consistency, knowing what you're going to get and getting it quickly.  That's what this Sonic location does well.  Plus, who can pass up hot and crispy Tater Tots??

3 stars because, on principle, I think that's the most any fast food place can reasonably expect."}
{"text":"The worst experience I've ever had in fast food. We ordered 6 shakes and family onion rings. Took 10-15mins to get the wrong order. Then another 7-10 to get another wrong order. With no correct order in site we decided to get our money back after 30+ mins. No one seemed to care that we waisted our time to leave with nothing. The worst part is telling your kids sorry no shakes today. This is an terrible establishment and I wont be back. Thier bring back the old drive in tradition with terrible service/wrong orders and they dont care."}
{"text":"Brian our carhop was great and efficient and amazing! From the time of the order to our food delivered, they were really amazing with their service."}
{"text":"This place was great and the employees are very hard workers. I came to this restaurant for lunch and they've gotten my burger wrong and gave me the correct burger and then they let me keep both burgers and they apologized for getting my order wrong and I said it's ok, you guys are working very hard today."}
{"text":"I was craving an Oreo milkshake so my fiancé graciously offered to run to Sonic to get one for each of us. It was close to closing time, no cars in the drive though, they were prompt with the order... however they gave him two (what I'm hoping is) cheesecake Oreo shakes, rather than the regular Oreo shake. If they weren't cheesecake flavor, I'd think the vanilla ice cream went bad because it was tangy. There was only a TINY amount of Oreo in there too. What a waste for $7, because now since I thought the ice cream was spoiled (the tangyness) I can't eat it. Hoping when I contact this location tomorrow they'll offer to fix this mistake."}
{"text":"It should just close down!!! Do not support this place. 3 different times I've tried to get lunch at 1:45pm. 3 different times I've driven away because I sat at the speaker box for 5 minutes without any acknowledgement.  Yes it was 5 minutes, because watch the time.  On 2 other occasions I've actually put an order in and got food it wasn't good. The only thing done right here is their drinks. I guess it isn't hard to mess up something that comes out of a soda fountain. AVOID at all cost!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give it another try. Went again tonight. Pulled into the drive thru at 11:50pm. I realized they closed in 10 minutes so I was going to just get something small. After waiting 5 minutes for someone to ask for my order she comes on and asks what I want. Once I order she tells me they are closed. Why would you ask for my order only to tell me you are closed once I order? The worst Sonic I've ever been too. Atleast there's a Jack In The Box across the street."}
{"text":"I had the New York hot dog. It was messy and hard to eat ... but still tasted very good. Seems like every time I visit this place the wind is blowing 40 MPH. Nice to be able to sit out doors though for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I love sonic and I know the food is good and I had to try this location. Not bad, everything a Sonic should have, the food was pretty good and the tater tots were amazing! Pretty clean and everything was fine, no problems at all."}
{"text":"Oh my god are you serious?? This is the worst sonic drive in in the United States.  Hands down.  Worst service every single time.  Every single time I come to this location I completely regret it. Unreal."}
{"text":"We got there at 11pm and they weren't busy at all.  We  went to the drive-thru and waited about 5 minutes with no one greeting us. We decided to just go park and order. Drove by the window to see 2 employees were just looking down on their cell phones. We hit the button to order and no one was taking our order. We just left and haven't been back since. Awful"}
{"text":"Pulled up to drive thru @ 820pm tonight, first and only car in line, sitting waiting to order and no one acknowledged our presence,  more waiting. ...figured they may be having technical difficulties with drive thru speaker (but no out of order sign posted) ...waited. ..3 cars show up behind us, after about 6 min we roll up to drive thru waiting area to see what may be the issue.  See all staff outside talking to people, hanging out,   more waiting as we try & get their attention to alert them to what we think may be a problem.  Nobody looks up....after about 5 min, a young man finally turns around. ...looks and runs back inside. We pull back around, now the 4th car inline & Magically the drive thru speaker is on......
Terrible service,  nobody managing what is going on. We left down the street to subway!"}
{"text":"I got a late night meal tonight at approximately 10 PM, I thought I would take my 7 year old out and get a shake and fries! I ordered a Chicago Dog and cheese tater tots! The food was appaulling, disgusting...... I have never written anything like this, but between the construction there, you owe your customers a decent meal! The tater tots had a half melted slice of cheese over the top, the fries were freezing as well as the hot dog! I called, Chris the manager needs to be retrained along as the staff!"}
{"text":"I love sonic and this place does well with their food and drink quality. They used to have a loitering problem but it seems it's gotten better! Still, if you pull up here late at night to grab a snack, lock your windows. anyways I really love this place. Only doing 4 stars cause sometimes it seems so sketchy over here."}
{"text":"If I could giver zero stars I would. Our visit was a complete disaster!!!

Went thru the drive thru for what I thought was a simple order. 
Order 3 drinks, a kids corn dog meal with tater tots and mozzarella sticks.
Was nicely greeted by a young man at the window who repeated our order correctly.  Paid and thought we were on our way.
NOT! No straws, so I park the car, walk to the restaurant to retrieve, get back to the car and my daughter shows me that the mozzarella sticks are old and not even hot, the cheese is rock hard.  Proceeded to go back thru the drive thru to order an additional item for my girl and she takes out her corn dog and its cold and ROCK hard, like it had been sitting there for a week. GROSS!
Get to the window with the nice young man and explain and show him what our order looked like and the girl at the cash register rudely slammed the window as he turned his back to talk to someone. 
I was embarrassed to bring all these errors to their attention, however this is unacceptable!! I request to speak with a manager, who comes to the window, he apologizes and says he'll get my new food. I pulled up as the drive thru was crazy busy and trying to be polite. Manager comes to car and again apologizes and asked what happened?  I wish I would have taken photos of the items we received, it was a joke and disgusting!
Will drive way out of my way to go to another Sonic, this place STINKS!!!!"}
{"text":"Trying the spicy popcorn chicken for the first time, flavor is ok. Somewhat dry. Love their soda slushies.friendly service, a little bit of a wait but the car hop wad very friendly and cheerful.  We like sonic and this location is convenient."}
{"text":"We love the shakes at Sonic,  and this location is closest to our house.  Every time we go there for shakes however,  they are disgusting.  We have had to take then back almost every time,  or we just throw them away.  When we visit the Decatur location,  the shakes are always awesome.  We finally have given up on this location after dozens of chances.  They also take forever!  25 minutes is a short wait at this location.  If I could give zero stars I would.  Disgusting!!"}
{"text":"This location is so much better than the Camino El Norte store.  The shakes are great here,  and they get you in and out!  We drive the 5 miles extra to go here  because it's so consistent"}
{"text":"I came here at 1:20am the line was extremely long didn't place my order until 1:42am, but even after I placed my order I still had to wait a very long time just to get my order. I hope it's not like this every night because this is ridiculous."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. Never in my life have I been more disappointed in an establishment. I pulled into a stall & I ordered two drinks. 15 minutes went by & I still had no drinks. So I pushed the button again & asked where my drinks were. Apparently they were unaware that I hadn't received my drinks. He told me they would bd right out with my drinks. 5 minutes go by & still nothing. I left with no drinks & im also calling to speak with a manager. I'll never revisit this store."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to diet cherry limeades.  I haven't tried the food but I can highly recommend their tasty beverages."}
{"text":"I am glad it was a slow day.... if my diabetes wasn't flaring up, I would have thrown the burger away. Slow service... food not up to Sonic standards. The \"kids\" working here all seemed lost."}
{"text":"This is what Sonic should taste like. Everything was very good. The service was friendly.  I still have to deduct a star because for some odd reason, Sonic food is good but never HOT."}
{"text":"This review is for 1 thing only. 

The Frito Chili Wrap Jr

This thing was a buck, it was freaking good. I will be getting the larger one next time."}
{"text":"I still find sonic only mildly appealing. 

The burgers have zero flavor and are cold. The frys are crap, the tots are ok. 

The hotdogs or I should say chili dog is good... and the drinks are good."}
{"text":"Still serving cold burgers. 

The chili is good though. 

The cherry Dr Pepper hits the spot too."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour from 2-5 drinks! Which I've been coming here for. Love the watermelon & cherry slush! The grape isn't bad. Neither is the cherry on it's own. The drive thru does get busy from 2-5 but it moves pretty fast.  The drive thru staff is friendly. 

If your looking for a different type of slushie or drink go to Sonic's. While your there grab a Texas toast burger LOL!!!"}
{"text":"Can't really mess up a drink can you? But they sure will give you a glass with soda spilled all over it and sticky!"}
{"text":"I went in and ordered a chili cheese dog and a wacky pack and the person on the speaker kept laughing. Then they took a long time to get my order out and about three people came to the window. And they were all laughing. And then they gave me my food. My chili cheese dog was the last thing they gave me. It was very suspicious and made me feel really uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Went through during a \"Happy Hour\", so was please to get a large Slurpy for $1.18.

Unfortunately, the waitress made a big deal out of making change,   She gave me back $3.18 out of $5.   

My fault for not checking, but as I pulled away, I definitely felt she was trying to short change me...just did not want to stop and look until I was  at a light down the road.

On top of being short changed, she borrowed a $1 from another girl who was in training...my guess is that girl never got the $1 back.

The Slurpy was lousy."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to one of these in a long while, but while vacationing in Las Vegas recently my daughter talked me in to going here for a quick lunch. Had a cheeseburger, and at my daughter's recommendation, I ordered the tator-tots with chili and cheese! WOW! Next time, I'll order the tator-tots with chili and cheese withouth the burger. 

Wish we had a Sonic Drive-In around here where I live. (maybe it's a good thing we don't)"}
{"text":"A lot of bad reviews for this place, so I was cautious coming here for lunch.  At the very least, my experience was not as bad as others on here.

Only one mistake in our order, a burger served with all toppings instead of plain as ordered.  Once it was brought to their attention, they quickly replaced it with another one.

Food was decent enough for fast food, and was served in an appropriate amount of time."}
{"text":"When I got there a little after 8 they weren't overly busy. I pulled up to a stall and pushed the button. A friendly voice immediately answered and asked if I could giver her a quick sec. That \"quick sec\" turned into 5 minutes later and she never came back on and took my order. I left. Not happy."}
{"text":"This is one place I probably will never get old of. I always substitute a soda for a  Strawberry limeade, which are THE best. Big size strawberries and of course crushed ice! 
The service is pretty fast.. Got my food within minutes!
Perfect drive-in pay method.
The burgers are usually loaded with lots of ketchup and mayo so that's why I'm putting 4 stars"}
{"text":"Short and sweet, here.

This Sonic closes early, around 9 I think. The next closest one is the corner of Flamingo and Pecos, witch stays open until 11pm. Makes no sense, since you would think this one would be about the same \"busy-ness\" level.

They are the world's slowest Sonic, I swear. I have done both the drive thu and parked at the drive in. It takes forever to get served either way. No joke, one night, I sat in the drive thu for like, 15-20 minutes!! C'mon, seriously? I should have got a discount for the gas I wasted in idle.

I have read reviews were they say sometimes it's fast, but I don't come enough to compare. I'm just talking about the three times I have gone.

Everything I have ordered has come out perfect, so that's good I guess. But with that kind of wait, it had better!"}
{"text":"Went multiple times.  Once I downloaded the new app and went for my free slush.  Hit \"use this coupon\" it disappeared, staff said there was nothing we can do. 
Another time we ordered a drink and an ice cream and people came in behind us with full meals.  We finally left after 30 minutes of waiting with no response from them."}
{"text":"My boy Dan gets it right every morning!!! Great place to stop for my morning drink!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I've been there they have messed up my order in some way. The first time I ordered a sonic blast w Carmel. They charged me for Carmel but there was none in it plus the bottom of the cup was busted and my ice cream was leaking out. The next I went I ordered a reese sonic blast and a snickers, they were both snickers. Very upset I haven't been back and I love that place."}
{"text":"The food was OK... the bacon was burnt ordered it with tomatoes and they forgot them fries were mushy but the people here was nice and friendly...

They could make it better"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Inside is dirty. They have phones to order at each table, but they were not working the day we went in. No sign posted saying so, so people kept coming in and trying to order in vain until an employee would eventually walk out to say the phones were broken and take orders. Bathroom was dark and filthy, not to mention you have to get someone to unlock it for you. Food was not great. We rarely choose to eat at Sonic and will certainly not return here anytime soon, if at all."}
{"text":"Happy Hour everyday from 2-4 a must do here in Phoenix, I go for the onion rings, drinks and Ice Cream treats. The burgers are ok too, but my fave Sonic meal is breakfast."}
{"text":"Chili cheese fries and strawberry banana shake after the gym... Not good but I was craving it for a long time lol"}
{"text":"When the sonic employee brought out my shake and onion rings the smell was just overwhelming.  I so almost got sick.  I knew it couldn't be my Oreo shake so I opened the onion rings and yep they were the culprit!  I assumed their grease was old :/ I almost sent them back and then I thought well heck if I asked for anything else friend it would smell like this as well :/ when I got closer to a trash can (I actually had the bag hanging out my door bc the odor was just way too much) I couldn't wait to dump them.  I was disappointed, that's for sure :/"}
{"text":"Boycotting Sonic... 
so I went to 19th ave and deer valley sonic a couple weeks back for lunch really wanting those pretzel twists. I sat there with the button pushed for 20+ min with no answer as the employees received their pizza delivery 1 person received food within this time 1 and that's when I pulled up ... I called the store the \"manager\" Irreland was rude so I asked for corporates number she happily gave me the stores number... dumbass... so after taking time out of my day and not getting to eat I called corporate... you know what I got after talking to a nice gentleman a SURVEY... no apology!! no phone call after my 
complaint not even coupons a damn SURVEY. What a joke then I write them and they tell me the manager of the store will call... is her name Irreland cuz shes an idiot! what a joke!! Don't go to this sonic... because you will not get served! I won't give sonic any of my money ever!"}
{"text":"I'm done with going to sonic. If I can give zero stars I would. I have been disappointed both times. This is the second time I have gone here and they have gotten my order wrong both times. All I asked for was a supersonic double bacon burger with no tomato. Both times it has had tomato on it. I'm allergic to it. I can't eat it. Last time It had no bacon but at least they got the double part right. This time it has no bacon still and I got a single burger when I paid for a double. This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Awful service! A drive thru shouldn't take 20 mins! I had people behind me in the back of the line getting their orders before me. Two employees brought me out the wrong order and said my order would be right out. Here I am for the second time in the drive thru and it's slow and still took about 15 mins once again. I didn't receive an apology and still had to pay. I'll definitely be speaking with a manager"}
{"text":"Thank you to Will for great service tonight!! We got our orders promptly and with friendly service! I'm all about my dog and Will noticed that I had her and he came out again just to give her a treat! I was very happy! Thank you!"}
{"text":"After a long night in Vegas and not eating dinner yet...I was STARVING! And this Sonic is open 24 hours and is located right across from the Palms. So we had the taxi drop us off at Sonic. 

I'm giving it 5 stars because:

* It's open 24 hours
* The guy who brought out our food was super nice and friendly
* The cheese tots make for great drunk food
* The frito pies make for great drunk food
* The popcorn chicken make for great drunk food

Plus it's cheap...after spending all my money at the bars, this place just hits the spot!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here around 5-6pm.. All we ordered was a small onion ring, a butter finger peanut butter concrete and he ordered a reese's pieces and peanut butter ice cream. This man loves his peanut butter so he was pretty pissed and annoyed when it was plain vanilla with reese's when he loudly and clearly said \"reese's pieces AND peanut butter ice cream\" so that crappy turn out for him, we also waited EXACTLY 8 minutes for all of this. Now we'd understand if we ordered a couple of hot dogs or a burger or two.. But no. That was all we got. We also noticed nobody moving around with a sense of urgency and there were only a few high school looking kids sitting outside and 2 cars at the pull in spots. So it wasn't busy. And the girl (not smiley AT ALL, with blonde hair up in a bun and fairly pale skin..) wasn't very welcoming.. Again, didn't smile once and she handed me the concrete and his ice cream and said \"thanks have a good night\" I certainly will once I get the rest of my order.. ?! She seemed extremely annoyed when I said \"um we ordered onion rings too\" she handed me the bag and didn't say a word. SO we typically go to the OTHER sonic on Boulder and Lake Mead.. We only tried this one to try it cause we live in Tuscany and thought it was closer. We'll drive the extra 2 minutes though gladly. The customer service was HORRIBLE, the wait was not understood and ridiculous and the main job - our order wasn't correct. We get people have bad days, leave that shit at home though. Don't take it to work, just some friendly advice. And listen when people are talking to you so you aren't messing peoples orders up."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!! Waited for about 45 minutes no food nothing! Now to wait for a refund!  They never came to give me a refund had to go to the window and wait for it. I will never be coming here again!! Everyone whom had came after myself and my father were served before us and it was outrageous !"}
{"text":"Oh, Sonic. My biggest love-hate relationship with any food place. The drinks are all pretty great and live up to the hype, although they could put in more drink and less ice. 

The food and service are a bit more all over the place.
The burgers are actually pretty great for fast food, certainly a step up from McDonalds and the like. The other standout menu items are the tots and the coneys. The rest of the menu ranges from good (popcorn chicken) to decent (cheddar bites) to terrible (onion rings). The breakfast items are all decent but nothing special.

The service at this particular location is the most frustrating thing about the place. Sometimes it's fine, even above average, but once every few times ever single part of the process will be screwed up. waiting ten minutes to get buzzed in at the drive-in when there is no line, frequently mixing up limeade types, or forgetting to put patties on hamburgers. All of this has happened multiple times. Also, a few times the food runner has waited around for a tip... it was awkward to say the least."}
{"text":"My first visit to a Sonic.  I live in Chicago and there aren't any around here.  It was good, but I don't see what the huge deal is.  The drive up parking spaces and roller skate girls are kind of fun and different but the food is nothing special.  

I was told to try to tater tots, but I think I'd prefer french fries.  I didn't get a chance to try all of the fancy drinks, so maybe next time I will get one of those.

The people at this location were really nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"This place is incapable of getting an order right. I clearly in front of three witnesses ordered a number 1 and 10 and they bring out a number 7. Then the girl cops an attitude like we screwed up the order. Do not go here unless you want to play food roulette. How hard is it to take an order and get it right ? Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I periodically go to this Sonic location but usually find a long line and wait to get food through the drive-through.  I normally don't drive into the \"stalls\". Recently I tried their ultimate chicken sandwich. Despite its price it was quite good. Yesterday I ordered this sandwich again.  When I got home I found that they had intentionally used the regular small chicken portion and the bun was either stale or had been too long under the heat lamp.  The entire sandwich was disgusting.  I will not return to this location. Either poor management or failure to control the staff is at issue."}
{"text":"Nice clean fast food restaurant with great service. I visit this sonic frequently because it's so close to work. The food is on par with other sonic locations but the service is way better than others. The food is always hot and fresh and the wait time for take out is only minutes. There's a cool car garage theme inside that's aesthetically pleasing for kids and adults.

The drive thru can be slow at times, so I would suggest ordering inside and taking it to go. I also like how you can pay right at the ordering station, so when the food comes out you are ready to go. 

The limades are awesome and come in all kinds of flavors. This is a great treat on a hot summer day. Also, check out the happy hour specials from 2PM to 4PM everyday.

I would highly suggest stopping into this Sonic if you are ever in the area."}
{"text":"We are very disappointed in our first sonic experience. The service was horrible!  The orders were not followed and they would not make it right.  Gave us a cup with a hole in it.  Whoever is planning on going to sonic....pick a different restaurant.  Awful food and service!"}
{"text":"I don't know what child made my $5 ice cream but they seriously don't know the value of money.  My blizzard or whatever had only snickers candy on the TOP none on the inside at all. That's seriously beyond RUDE AND UTTERLY UNACCEPTABLE for a chain like this. I suppose baskin robins would prefer my money. Shame on you child. Hope you read this!"}
{"text":"Took way too long to get food. The employees were confused that it was raining outside and that there were fireworks on new year's eve. Fries were accidentally replaced with tater tots, and the food wasn't very good even for a sonic."}
{"text":"I just visited this location on my lunch break and I will never go back! My husband had to repeat our order to the woman taking our order (Veronica) three times and when we received our order it still wasn't correct. I actually felt bad for the carhop because he got stuck in the middle of it and had to apologize for Veronica's mistake. The food made the experience even worse because the eggs in my burrito were actually stale. Avoid this location if you can!"}
{"text":"I am disgusted by the service (or lack thereof) I experienced at this location the last THREE times I have been here. It is on my way to work, so it is a natural place to stop. NOT ANYMORE. I will be driving a few additional miles to avoid this location. My last visit was the last straw. 
1. I called into this location to give them a heads up that I was bringing 20 kids in. I asked if it would be easier to order over the phone. I was just trying to help make things easier. The phone was passed around to four different people, and all of them sighed loudly and made sure I understood that I was being a huge inconvenience. A sweet girl, Trinity (I think), finally came on the phone and said we could get the drink orders going to make things easier. Thank you, Trinity. 
2. When we arrived there was a very rude girl that wouldn't look me in the eye, and made sure I knew AGAIN that I was being a huge inconvenience. This girl's name was Carissa or Carrie (I think). She glared at us most of the time, loudly used the F word multiple timed concerning our order, and refused to fix the parts of the order that were messed up. 
3. This sonic is getting run into the ground. The same employee has been rude to me on multiple occasions. I will not be returning. As a coach, I often take my team for after game treats. No more sonic for us."}
{"text":"The food and service were fine. My gripe was with the person who took our order. We asked him how their wing special worked and he sounded annoyed about answering. I definitely understand how it can be irritating to repeat the same thing all the time, but he chose to do the job. I think his name was Cole. Just please be less rude next time.  Your valued sonic customers would appreciate it."}
{"text":"I know all fast food workers don't use gloves, but this confuses me. I was sitting in the drive thru (my daughter wanted a shake I hate this location) and I'm watching a young man peel a banana with his hands the break it into pieces with his hands, put it into a cup, the wipe his hands off onto his black apron. Kinda gross. Is his apron clean??"}
{"text":"daaaaamn sonic. There you go again hyping up your drive in with comical commercials.

This was my 2nd visit to a sonic. The first was down in Fl. I was in the plaza for something and we decided to eat here! The commercials always advertise delicious food and shakes.. But the menu seemed extremely basic once we were here. I couldn't even remember all of those shakes that I screamed \"omg I have to try that\" no idea? 

Soooooo we ordered 3 Jr deluxe cheeseburgers. They were on sale for $0.89. We added bacon to them and asked for no onion on one... They all came w. onion still -_-

As a side, I ordered fries and my bf ordered chili cheese tots. Our food was OK, but very basic. Our total came to under $9 so that was cool. 

Deff glad I visited here and that we have one in the area. Will I visit again? Prob if I'm in the area, but I won't go out of my way to come here no matter how funny those commercials are or how awesome their shakes look on tv."}
{"text":"Normally, I would let this go but being 8 months pregnant, I just can't. 

I ordered a coney with onion and the order was repeated back to me. Not only did the coney not come with onion, it looks like absolute garbage. 

This is the 3rd or 4th time we have come to this sonic and have had issues with the food. It doesn't look fresh, looks like it has been literally thrown together, tastes burnt or overlooked, and is just not worth the money that sonic usually costs for a meal. 

I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"i have been in like for 15 mins and im still in line the service sucks




the food is good tho"}
{"text":"Went to one of the drive up stations today. Took my time looking at the menu before I decided to order. And finally push the button. A guy answers me and asked me how he can help me I started off my order by ordering a number three just the way it comes. Then I ordered a number two no onions apparently this threw him into a tizzy and he started asking me what DO you want on it. I gave him the list of things that I wanted on it I then asked for a chili cheese Coney on the side and he said which one. I'm sorry I don't visit sonic that much I didn't know there was different sizes he asked me 6 inch or foot long I said 6 inch is fine. I then asked to get a premium hotdog on the side and he again asked me which one and I said will how about a 6 inch and he said OK that's fine but which one. I did not appreciate being yelled that. Its not ok. Maybe you should try to help the customer by guiding them in the right direction. He was in a hurry and it was obvious and he could care less so I canceled my order and left. I wish I had gotten his name but I won't be back"}
{"text":"Blown away by my visit here today. Sat in the drive thru line for 30 minutes before I ordered with only 5 cars in front of me. Ordered a burger, asked for no lettuce, they confirmed. Get to the window, and they repeat the order as no tomato. I corrected them, and when my food was handed to me, a side of a horrible attitude towards me was included as if I had done something to offend them. When it's time to eat my food, I opened the burger to find that they half heartedly attempted to scrape the lettuce off of the burger and failed miserably as there was still plenty of lettuce. 

Management: if you are reading this, please do something about the customer service and experience that you're employees are providing to the paying customer. It was less than adequate, I wouldn't return for another meal at this location even if it was free after that experience."}
{"text":"If you come to this location, make sure you pay with exact change or always ALWAYS check. Every time I come here they short change me and don't give me a receipt. I'm done with this location, which is a shame since my Cos school is right across the street."}
{"text":"I came for breakfast on a Saturday morning and Customer service was great, fast, and very helpful. Thumbs up to a good job!  Would definitely recommend stopping here."}
{"text":"Got my order wrong and they fixed it but it actually was wrong again and I already drove away. All I ordered was a drink. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Cold burgers and fries. Order was messed up. 

Drinks are good. Called manager (Kaley) to complain. Excellent service on that front. She offered to credit the entire meal. Waited for CC bill and it was indeed taken off."}
{"text":"Worst Sonic experience ever. My wife's sandwich was made out of rubber and my strawberry limeade tasted like it was club soda with a lime in it."}
{"text":"I dislike coming to this Sonic's location, but it's the only one close to my house. They take way too long to come out with your food after you order. There have been plenty of times I wanted to leave, but I already paid and asking for my money back might take longer than waiting for the food."}
{"text":"Every time my husband and I come here our shakes aren't mixed well. And there's flavor concentrate that's disgusting. Shakes are not up to par. And the last time I came i had holes in my cup that they covered up with stickers. Like seriously? How hard is it to get a new cup. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"The worst location I have EVER been to.  I have frequented Sonic in numerous states and at numerous locations.  First, they could not take our order accurately.  We repeated it about 4 times.  Then my husband always orders the foot long hot dog.  It is not on the menu.  However, they do offer a chili cheese dog and a plain dog (which she can add anything to).  

Therefore, he puts the Chicago toppings on it.  He does this everywhere, without fail.  This time, they do not tell him but deliver a regular size hot dog to him.  The guy explains we are wrong.  When we are nearly done with our meal, the manager comes out and explains that we are wrong.  His staff was trained improperly.  He gave us another regular size hot dog.  This was nice.  But it was SO backhanded.  You are wrong, but here is a hot dog.  Thanks (please read that in a sarcastic tone)."}
{"text":"Ok - so I like the feel of this place, but overall quality is just ok.  

It is a good place to get a hot dog and some tater tots.  Who does not love tater tots?  The location is a bit off, just tucked into a semi-residential/strip mall area.  I love tater tots and I love that when I get my food here it is hot and delicious.  

I wish they had more of a variety but this is a chain after all.  If you sign up for emails, you always get notifications of coupon and deals.  They have special everyday and happy hours for appetizers.  

Try it out for a quit meal when you are out and about."}
{"text":"The service tonight at this location was pretty bad. I asked for peanuts to go with my caramel sundae (because it says on the menu they offer peanuts) and the girl at the window replied \" McDonald's has peanuts we don't) smh"}
{"text":"I've never been to this place without them messing up my order. Highly recommend saving your time and going somewhere else. Seriously terrible"}
{"text":"I like the food. Try it for the first time. The strawberry limenade keeps me a happy camper. The only thing bugs me is that there is no instruction for first timer. And I feel lost about how to order. And the guy didn't even give me my changes back."}
{"text":"I wanted to treat my kids to a slush of their choosing after school for being so well behaved at school. We parked at the carhop spots and order 2 small slushes at 2:53pm. We didn't get our slushee till 3:16. Seriously??? 23 mins to make and deliver 2 small shushes. 2 small slushes nothing else!! This is not the first time this particular sonic took their sweet a** to bring a order out. Go to a different one I warn you. It will drive farther yes but I guarantee you will still get your food quicker."}
{"text":"My husband really likes Sonic. We had already eaten elsewhere and were not too hungry, so we ordered dessert of a limeade drink and two ice creams. The total cost was about $11. Our food was brought out to the car within a few minutes. Everything was high in sugar or fat but tasted good."}
{"text":"I have never been so a Sonic so bad :(

It takes a lot for me to give a place 1 star but this one deserves it.

I Pulled up to order and had to wait 15 minutes before someone took my order. Why 15 minutes?!?! I was thinking to myself after the experience why I even waited that long.

The service was terrible and the food was so greasy. The grease was oozing from the tater tots and the cheese wasn't even melted on my dog which makes me wonder what kind of cheese it is to begin with. I asked for regular coke and got diet. I never had a problem at any of the other Sonic locations so I am not sure what it up with this one but I will never be back. 

I wish I had something positive to say but I just don't."}
{"text":"Gotta say, I love this retro drive-in....great burgers, handmade shakes, onion rings and Matthew the rollerskating car-hop, all  make this one of my favorite places. There's always some sort of social happening and the toys in the kid's meals are REALLY out of control."}
{"text":"Really stinks when you have a simple drink order and they mess it up. They brought out four drinks when I ordered three(one small sprite, large diet dr peppers and a chocolate milkshake). I told the girl I didn't need the extra diet dr pepper so she takes all my drinks back in to get the extra drink taken off. She comes back 15 minutes later with extra drink taken off and the milk shake has melted by this time. We come here for drinks after school and never have good service. I wish they had better customer service!"}
{"text":"Serves was ok but could of been quicker.

Cheese burger and Chicken deluxe both had no flavor. 

Tots were unsalted and just warm. 

Chicken strips were the biggest disappointment being dry and hard with no flavor. 

A little pricey $$$

I was excited to try sonic but now After this experience I'm just disappointed"}
{"text":"Alex from sonics is on point, she did four separate orders for my friends and I super quick and her eyeliner was on fleek."}
{"text":"Now, I don't like to review chains because consistency is one of their strongest assets. BUT, I'd been wanting to go to a Sonic for years so I feel obligated to review it after my first experience there. I demanded that we stop here on our midnight roadtrip to Park City, UT. We were desperate to get out of the car and get some fresh air so we forewent the drive-in window. In the covered outdoor seating area there were more walk-up menus and ordering devices. It was very strange and fun. We were disappointed that the waitresses didn't come out on rollerskates but they were cute and patient nonetheless. I got a bacon cheeseburger on Texas toast which was pretty typical but the Texas toast was such a great addition. We were very intrigued by the fact that there was no inside except for the kitchen but we had fun hanging out in the chilly desert night. 

A must-do for anyone who has ever seen the commercial and said to themselves \"where the hell is there a Sonic?\""}
{"text":"I am always disappointed here. Their food tastes old. Their frozen lemonade comes to you partly melted. Today, I go for ice cream and order a regular brownie blast and get rung up for a malted brownie bliss. When I informed them I wanted just a regular brownie blast they tell me that's what it is. Even though the receipt and appearance of the ice cream say otherwise. I tell my server that I usually go to another location and when I order a brownie blast I get vanilla ice cream loaded with brownie pieces. She takes it back and comes back with vanilla ice cream with tiny black tasteless specs. So, my advise, if you're a fan of Sonic, take the trip to 59th and Union. You will never feel disappointed there!"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food, as I was purchasing for someone else. When I want junk food, though, Sonic is the bomb!
I ordered food. It came out fast and the server was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is yummmmy. Great shakes. Great Tator tots. The chili cheese dog I had was wimpy. I wouldn't get that again but the tots and shake were awesome."}
{"text":"Maybe I had not eaten Sonic in a long time...maybe it was a full moon...IDK!? 

However, they get 4 stars from me. The food was fast and fresh, exactly how it should be! The young man who brought it was SOOOOOOOO polite....my friend ran back in and gave him a tip in front of his manager...btw....how strange is it to walk into a Sonic!? So weird....nonetheless...great all around that night."}
{"text":"They have never gotten any order right. When I spilled my drink on my lap in front of the guy, he didn't say anything.  I asked for more napkins and he brought me two back. Staff is not helpful. When you attempt to correct the order they argue with you. I will be going the distance for somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries. Like the atmosphere concept of a modern spin on a 1950's era drive in."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of places around here that are open past 10 pm but this chain is.  So one evening when I was out late and had eaten a late lunch and wasn't hungry at a normal dinner time, I stopped in here after 11-ish for a bite. 

I got a Foot Long Chili Dog special for $2.99 (with onions), a small Tater Tots,  a small cherry slushie, and a small coffee to save and reheat in my motel room the next mornig.  That cheap hot dog was delicious. The Tater Tots were freakin' awesome!  And I don't even like Tater Tots.  But these were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with just enough oil to help it crunch with a wonderful texture.

I got my cholesterol and calories and sodium quotients  in for the next month in one simple trip.  Ouila!"}
{"text":"I like their Tater Tots tho I haven't had them for ages, they have good drinks, the breakfast sandwiches are pretty good,  though not very healthy I'm sure.   A coupla nights ago I stopped in here late to try out their Holiday Chocolate Mint Milkshake.   It was pretty good,  very creamy,  good flavor,  about a dollar more than the Peppermint one at Arby's.   Both had tons of peppermint slivers in them.   I'd rather just have the mint flavor without the particles I have to chew.   To each his own. 

I'd go back but not too often."}

{"text":"I gave this place 2 Stars over a year ago because they constantly screwed up my orders and the drive-thru was incredibly incredibly slow. I decided to give it another chance since it has been more than a year. Nope. It's just as bad as it was before. I waited in the drive thru for over 20 minutes. I would have left if I could have gotten out but the way the drive-thru is built, once you're in you can't get away. It took forever for them to even greet me on the intercom. It would have been nice if they could have just said we are experiencing problems and orders are taking longer than normal, or even given me a coupon or courtesy item like many other restaurants do. But nothing. No acknowledgement of their suckiness. Of all the fast food restaurants in the area, this place has the absolute worst customer service and is the absolute slowest I have ever been to. DO NOT GO HERE EVER!"}
{"text":"Pretty sad when you can't get a hot hot dog. Went through the drive thru, was given one price at the box then a new price at the window. They some how magically lost our order and asked us to recite it well over 5 times. The food we did get was warm except the ice cold hot dog. No apologies from the girl at the window and she huffed and puffed when we asked for a hot hot dog."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came into this Walmart and famished we decided since there was a sonic and we've been mcdonalds'd out we would try something different so we ordered and the prices are really getting ridiculous for fast food. The cashier looked bored and was super rude and this was after we were trying to joke with her. Then I wanted to have something to put my ketchup in so I could dip my tots in and two girls smiled at me but never asked me if I needed something and even walked past me a couple times, until the cashier finally \"saw\" me and asked what I needed and even when I said in a chipper way \"thank you\" she just looked on zombie like. My fiance wanted a refill on his regular sized drink (coke) and was charged $0.86 which is really ridiculous! If they wanted to they could just refill the cup instead of providing a brand new one.... We walked out having spent $16 and were very disappointed with the food and service- this place is almost enough to stop me from visiting other Sonic Restaurants."}
{"text":"Just picked up lunch for the wife while she is having Chemo done at MD Anderson......

Tater tots are very cold and very old.
Shake didn't taste right.
Diet Coke was flat.
My burger wasn't fully cooked, 3/4 pink.

The corn dogs were acceptable and the manager was friendly and apologetic and credited my card for the rest of the purchase when I called in, so not the end of the world, could have been worse...

But now I have to go back out in the heat somewhere else and get her lunch again.....

I most likely will not return here.

Sonics seem to be sucking every single time I go there anymore....

I think I'm probably done with the chain at this point.

:( I used to love Sonic, hate to see it sliding this way...."}
{"text":"Food is as usual but noticed that the machines on the outside in the sitting area didn't work and the ones on the inside are in desperate need of repair."}
{"text":"Pretty solid experiences here.  Nothing mind-blowing, but good and consistent."}
{"text":"Was standing out in the patio area for about 15 minutes pushing the call button and no one even acknowledged I was there. You can see the staff in the back just talking. Completely disappointed in Sonic and the way they treat customers."}
{"text":"This is my second and last time attempting a milk shake here.  They give you a spoon instead of a straw.  The straws they do have are soda straws that are thin and flimsy and collapse when you drink out of them.  They need thick, wide, milkshake straws.  If I wanted ice cream, then I would get ice cream and eat it with a spoon.  I want to drink a milk shake out of a straw, not a pipe cleaner."}
{"text":"It is the cruelest joke for there to be Sonic commercials on our TVs here in Northern California only for there not to be any Sonics nearby.  Epic fail.  One of the few redeeming things about Vegas is that there are no fewer than 6 Sonic Burgers.  How does it compare to In N Out?  It doesn't.  But it has a bunch of pretty darn good food like the Coney Dog.  A chili cheese hot dog for $2.  Yum.

The popcorn chicken, onion rings, and tater tots are all surprisingly good as well.  And of course, their smoothies and shakes are where they shine.

So no it's not as good as In N Out, but it is pretty darn good and after paying through the nose for room service and hoity-toity restaurants, you just couldn't beat a oily, heavy, mouth-watering, delicious $5 meal at Sonic."}
{"text":"Now that the hype is over about Sonic finally making it up to the frozen north, you can honesty compare it to other similar dining establishments.  The curbside service is unique, but there are some local establishments that do it better.  The menu is basic.  The burgers are OK, nothing special.  Actually, their hot dogs, especially their Chicago dogs are quite good.  Having tater tots instead of fries is a pleasant alternative.  Drinks are extensive, but generally just okay.  Most of their slushies are just too sweet.  Overall, it is a relatively unique experience, but food and drink quality is nothing special."}
{"text":"This Sonic is the closest thing to my bf's house so we go when everything else is closed.  The past week or so it has gotten so much worse than ever.  We are used to waiting 15 to 40 minutes in line, we joke about bringing movies to watch for the wait.  In the past 3 visits the order has been wrong every single time.  Two out of three were so wrong it actually ruined our meal and we didn't even want it.  This is the same Sonic that left a twistie tie in my burger a couple years ago.  

I think I will just start going to gross Wendys or maybe actually cooking when it's too late to go somewhere better."}
{"text":"Sonic. Never had it until I went to AZ. 

So..they have everything. Burgers, sandwiches, wraps, coneys (what?), salads, smoothies, breakfast items, a billion sides, desserts, and numerous beverage choices.

Everyone raves about the tater tots, so I ordered them. Yeah, they were....tater tots....a lot of...tater tots. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but....they were tater tots.

I think the Cherry Limeade is where it's at. I'm a sucker for the little marachino cherries in my beverages. Reminds me of \"kiddie cocktails.\" The peach tea is also delicious, as is the slushes.

There's one thing I didn't understand about this place: They sell bags of ice through the drive-thru. Now, someone help me out....Is that standard for all Sonics? Or, is it because it's Arizona and it's 19,000 degrees? Just curious."}
{"text":"I remember the long lines of traffic when this place first opened.  No more.  Service is really slow.  Food is served fresh, but menu lacks imagination, even by fast food standards.  Drinks are overly sweet.  The Sonic's I've visited in the South always seem better than the local ones."}
{"text":"If you have never been to a Sonic, and this is your first experience, you will be disappointed.  Service was incredibly slow.  Cars started honking to get the servers attention.  Must admit food was well prepared.  Menu is your basic burgers and fried chicken.  Drink selection good.  This location is unusual in that it had an indoor sitdown area."}
{"text":"There are a bunch of problems with this location. There is a credit card slot on the order screen that didn't work. There are no trash cans near the parking spots. I ordered a Coney and didn't get a fork and knife. When the server came out with the order, they had no condiments or napkins. No, it wasn't slow, but I'd rather it have taken a little bit longer and not have made me dig through my car for napkins from fast food orders past."}
{"text":"We came here on 6/24/2015 at 8:24 pm for the 79 cent slushes and the machine was broken! He said \" the machine isn't working, it's coming out just water\". Things happen I know, but the wait was 5 minutes and we finally get to the window to order, then it's broken."}
{"text":"I came with my fiancée to this location at about 4am on 01/20 because I had just gotten off of work and was hungry. the lady was hella cool and upgraded our drinks. I'm almost positive she was a manager working alone, but she was super quick with our order. she made me the most bomb burrito for me lol like the best burrito of all time"}
{"text":"I was visiting family in the area and decided to go for a milkshake on a warm evening, shakes were half off because it was after 8pm. The only downside to going here was the  time it took to  take our order and then bringing the order to us. To their defense it was packed and the order was to t was correct. I'f I'm ever visiting family and having a craving for a cold treat. I'd go back  knowing it could possibly take  awhile to get  my treat."}
{"text":"The service was good. The gentleman at the resister was really nice. They've also renovated the inside dining area.. but the food... omg.. our food was so cold! The cheese wasn't melted on the burgers.. the tots and fries were cold as well. No wonder the food came out so fast!"}
{"text":"Someone forgot their happy pill today. I believe that drive thru personnel should not be on the intercom if they are irritated or having a bad day and dont have the ability to mask their irritability while working...kinda puts a damper on your Sonic excitement. The one that came with you thinking of a good \"burger joint\" to find a milkshake at."}
{"text":"When in need of a guilty pleasure sonic comes to mind. There selection from deep fried foods to ice cream choices keeps me coming back. I'm a sucker for their corn dogs and mozzarella sticks and the sonic blasts. The employees working here always appear positive and deliver excellent customer service."}

{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(248/365) \"Thirst Aid Station\"

Love stopping by for Sonic Happy Hour! Perfect for a very hot day with my go to drink which is their sweetened Iced Green Tea, easy ice. That way, I won't finish my drink in 4-5 sips. Half off drinks from 2-5 is a very cool deal!

Food wise, when a craving hits, I like their foot long Coney Dog and their sweet onion rings. The service has always been pleasant, and other locations around town make it very convenient to cool off when the Vegas heat gets to you.  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Please Sonic, teach your employees to watch their hands and keep them OFF the waffle cones when bringing them out to cuetomers. That's what the white paper is for!! It is disgusting!!  I tried to call, because they need a chance to be aware of what they're doing, but the phone rings forever, nobody answers, and no machine comes on."}
{"text":"I came here on July 3, 2017 and ordered the five-piece chicken strips meal, french fries, and Oreo concrete shake. 

The chicken was not even warm and had almost a rubber texture to it. The fries were arguably cooked in last week's oil: cold, lifeless, somewhere between zero taste and microwave taste (therefore, pretty much inedible). The shake was amazing, but being as my meal was nearly $15 for fast food it wasn't good enough to offset the tenders and fries.

I know Sonic can do better, but here's a word to the wise: if tonight had been the very first Sonic trip of my life, I'd never go to any Sonic location again and I'd urge all my friends to do the same."}
{"text":"Okay I'm timing the drive thru this as it's here at Sonic to get my 3  corn dogs and a large cherry coke did the survey on the receipt for the free beverage with the purchase of any food item so far I've been waiting in line 4-5 minutes just cars were ahead of me in one now.
A server came out and gave me my food while in the drive thru because mine was ready before the car ahead of me awesome"}

One of the worst Sonic's that I have ever been to. A 'Toaster' sandwich that isnt toasted/grilled and yet the cheese isnt melted either and tots that arent even warm. WTF?"}
{"text":"Longest wait in the drive thru. Tried to charge us for the order behind us since we were at the window for that long. Took exactly 7 minutes for them to even open the window to see if we had payed yet and still didn't have our food or even drinks. We ended up waiting 18 mins to get our food, and that's not from when we ordered that's from when we pulled up to the pick up window. Just horrible"}

{"text":"They sell the cheapest food they can possibly get. And when I mean cheap , i'm talking the lowest quality of food , I mean cheap for them expensive for you!  The only reason why they get Business is because of the carhop scene resembling the 1950s."}

{"text":"Just took 30 minutes to go through the drive thru and buy a two drinks. When I pulled up to the window the guy operating the window ignored me for a few minutes while he wiped his area and did some other stuff. What made me upset was my shake was just sitting there inside the window melting. It's not like the guy had to go get it.. Also, the guy operating the window needs to either cut his hair or tie it up. Long frizzy hair down to your shoulders isn't ok when operating a food service business. I operate and own my own and my wife is a public health food inspector.. No-go!"}

{"text":"My Girl and I love coming here great service. Just sometimes they forget wth you ordered. My favorite thing to get is the chicken club shit goes hard! N when we go theres hardly anyone else in there so sometimes we have the whole place in silence . Drivein is awesome as well.."}
{"text":"Honestly, I enjoy visiting sonic drive - in's. Especially during their happy hours between 3pm to 5pm. 1/2 DRINKS with real fruit!! 

The entire deal of a sonic drive - in is you order from your parked car and eat and relax in your parked car. With no rush whatsoever. It is excellent! 

I ordered, at this location, their snickers waffle cone sundae and the chili cheese tatter tots. My boyfriend ordered the Oreo shake. Their ice cream is light and creamy while the tatter tots are salt, but both together are delicious. 

The customer service is great. The drive in was clean. 

I recommend trying their waffle cone sundaes!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  

Fast food breakfast all day! Need I say more.  The 1$ breakfast burrito and 1$ tater tot were served  hot and fresh! The wait was a little long but it was pretty good for fast food.  It took about 15 minutes. The place was packed.  Me thinky this is a pretty good place! 

When I looked at the prices for a burger it seemed a little  cheaper than five guys. I need to try a burger one day!"}
{"text":"Hotdogs are absolutely DISGUSTING, cold old and gross and the chili on the hotdog was just as gross. I'll never go to a Sonic anywhere based on the horrible/disgusting/nasty/old ass food I got tonight (4-11-17). P.S I threw that sh!t away and order Barro's Pizza"}
{"text":"I stopped at the drive-thru to grab a bite to take back to the office yesterday.  Sonic's are different everywhere I go.  This one has a drive thru, but there is no payment/ pick up window.  They bring it to the curb.  

The speaker guy was friendly and let me know all my choices with my combo. The food was hot and fresh.  I asked for the burger with mustard only, and they took off the lettuce/tomato, but I should have clarified.  
Good cherry limeade, too!"}
{"text":"We tried this place once because of all the buzz about it and it looked like a fun place and brought back memories of the old A and W restaurants of our childhood.  
Boy were we disappointed.
The food served here is total junk.  As in junk, junk food.  I wouldn't recommend this place to a homeless person.
Wonder bread buns, el cheapo hot dogs, rats ass chili sauce.  This place has found food from every one of my most unpleasant memories of CHEAP junk food and put them all on their menu.  God save us all."}

I live close by.

This place for years has never been right

PS...that last review....come on now...we. Can tell thats a friend or employee writing that review

This is actually the sonic to avoid


2nd visit...
Messed up my orded once again!!!

Its even correct on the reciept



Every damn time!!!   They mess up my order


.i had the same issues over 2 years ago...nothing has changed..ur store sucks and ur a joke of a manager

Im gonna make sure to report ever bit to corporate


Wasted so much time and money at this location.....

THEY NEED TO FIRE EVERYONE AND START OVER..

I'm diabetic so I always ordered a diet one. One day I asked for one and the attendant informed me that it is a sugar enriched slushy with diet squirted into it . Imagine how I felt. Don't be fooled. I was also pregnant and insulin dependent at the time. That made me"}
{"text":"Happy hour is the only time I go there usually.  The fruit slushes are the best, when they are good.  They know it so they charge a bit much for a fruit slush. Which is sometimes inconsistent. Still drinkable, but who wants to live with cold disappointment? 

The fried pickles are really good.The whole menu is pretty greasy and the portions are small compared to the price. Only go when there  is a special, happy hour or you have coupons."}

I felt like I could have gone to Applebees, ordered, ate and left before I got my meal from this Sonic location. If you ever have to endure a meal at this location you may be as shocked as I was at how impossible it seems to be to access - it's almost like they don't want customers."}

First off we asked the guy if everything was in the bag when we left... TWICE and we still paid for the chili tots that were not put in the bag and then one of the mozzarella sticks was completely hollow. The last time which was months ago that we went, there was a bone in the popcorn chicken needless to say we haven't gone back for a while because of that & this visit just gave us even more reason not to, well at least not for the food. Seems like the only thing sonic is good for is the cherry limeades nowadays."}

When I asked the kid for a \"croissant breakfast sandwich\" he said \"I can't hear you.\" Then I spoke a little louder and said \"croissant breakfast sandwich\" and the kid responded \" a breakfast sandwich with the softest of bread?\" This miscommunication went back-and-forth another three times. This is the second time I've had a problem with this place long ago I tried getting breakfast here and it wasn't very good I had coupons that came in the mail sent but those coupons weren't honored when I got to the window.  The kid took the coupons from me but then after he took my credit card as well he did nothing about the coupons I'm assuming just threw them away and charge the full amount to my credit card by the time I realized it was pulling out of the drive through I was irritated. I called the manager and they assured me that they would make it right but they never did even after I went through the trouble of getting them all the information off of my receipt and now after trying to give them a second chance I see no option but to leave this terrible review.  Don't go here."}
{"text":"Sooooo. My mother suggested we get sonic. I agreed. We ordered. Food came out cramped up in a small bag. Everything seemed straight out of a freezer and not fresh. The corndog to the cheddar poppers. The corn dog was about as big as my palm (small). Think I expected too much. Maybe ? The ice was the only thing good. Oh well.  The ocean water had no flavor it tasted exactly like its name, ocean water. & my Sprite ran out of the syrup tasted like tonic water.   she exchanged them nicely. Surprisingly."}
{"text":"Open till' very late at night, how could I complain? If I want a root beer float late at night, I can come here and share a banana split while I'm at it. There are tons of things on the menu and they have a happy hour."}
{"text":"This was my first time and I was really looking forward to it. 
The drive through person was either new or just had absolutely no idea what they were doing. 1 star for service. 
Ate off their breakfast menu. Good. But nothing special. 3 star. 
So 2 star overall."}
{"text":"The area feels unsafe at times, but first the food. Last night I went to get a plain cheeseburger, I made the mistake of not checking my food before driving off. I get home and it is covered in mayo. So I drive back. I am waiting at the window and some immature guys walk in front of my car to walk out of the parking lot. One wise guy decides he's going to pretend that he is urinating in front of my car by having his back to me and all I see is a stream between his legs. I was tempted to honk my horn but didn't feel safe so I was frustrated. Then when the guy gives me my correct order I hear something hit my car. I told him that something just hit my car. He said yeah we have been having problems with that all night???? So call the cops? I don't get it. I am done with this sonic. To many times has my order been completely wrong and now that it doesn't feel safe and they don't care I refuse to go back."}
{"text":"Great Place Love there drinks the only mistake was walking over and sitting in 110 degree weather we should have driven over. The services is good I got a chocolate soda and my wife a slushie. The burgers are great, but like I said try eating in front of all theses cars with the engines going and the heat not good"}
{"text":"I ordered a milkshake and it took them literally a half hour just to take it out to me, causing my boyfriend to be late for work. I've only been here twice and it wasn't that bad, but this experience was terrible"}
{"text":"This place is deliciously delightful! I drove the 120 miles each way to experience it since they won't stop advertising in Chicagoland, and I think it was worth the trip. Cream Pie Shakes - OMG to DIE for! Ocean Water - DELICIOUS! Slushies - AWESOME! Their frito burrito/wrap thing was incredible as well, the burger was HUGE, fries were great, and I can't remember what else I had, but I had a lot to make the drive worthwhile. There's so much to try, and I haven't had a bad thing yet. Also, they're opening up 4 more near Chicago this year - YAY Sonic!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas I have to go to sonic. I love the double cheeseburger, their hotdogs are bomb and I always drive back to California eating their onion rings ... they are my favorite. All their desserts and ice cream's are great but I love my 44 ounce unsweetened unflavored Iced tea. I know this sounds funny but they have the best ice anywhere LOL"}
{"text":"They're trying.  I learned paying with the app only works w/the drive-in style kiosks, NOT the drive thru or at the counter.  Better, and the service was very pleasant, of late."}
{"text":"I want to work at Sonic, I want to get paid to whip around on roller blades all day! How have I never been to Sonic? Oh that's right, because I don't eat meat, it was a bit pointless. My Dad suggested Sonic and I went along with it so everyone could enjoy (see, I'm not always selfish about restaurants PAUL)  I quickly looked up veg options online and found there are ZERO, unless you eat cheese which I am currently avoiding, otherwise they do have a grilled cheese. I was more than happy with my jalapeño strings and lime slushee. The jalapeños had a nice greasy fried kick, and the sour lime cut right through it. My son had this seriously long hot dog and did his best to devour the entire thing. The service was a bit slow, it took a long time for them to even take our order, the food seemed generic, but that lime slushee was damn good so I'd come back just for that!"}
{"text":"The owner of this franchise, Chris, wrote me a email asking me about his Sonic location. After a few correspondents' with him, I will be the first to say to all the reviewing on here: 

Give this Sonic another chance. 

This is the owner's first franchise. He does live around the Madison area, and he cares about having a good running franchise. 

For being a some what freshly built Sonic, they are having a  couple rough patches to figure out. But with some detailed complaints, the things I noticed seem to have been fixed. 
My recommendations: Order a foot long Chicago dog from here and enjoy it. 
What also separates this Sonic from a few others is the fact that the owner on this franchise decided to go with a high quality Vienna beef hot dog on all 6\" dogs. 
Who knew?

I think this Sonic could very nice (they just had to make a bunch of mistakes first to start to realize it).
They have great ice cream shakes!!!! What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Not too bad, the service is alright and the drive-thru takes a little long.  Haven't been here early enough in the day to order up front at the window so my entire experience is based on the drive-thru.  Picked up a jr. egg burrito and a shake and it took about 20-25 minutes.  Good thing I wasn't in a hurry or I would've been late.. nonetheless, the food came out good complete with condiments so nothing short of an average experience at Sonic!"}
{"text":"I like to stop in every so often for a limeade and an egg burrito. ya ya I know it's a weird combo but sometimes my brain needs its fix so I try appease.  The line is usually pretty long and I have to wait awhile to get to the drive thru window but I usually try to check beforehand to direct myself to the parking lot instead of waiting in line with everyone else.  Nonetheless, the staff is very nice and always smiling."}
{"text":"We Love Sonic, but I'm not sure whats going on with the staffing at this one. Our last 2 visits our orders were wrong. The other night the menu boards where you park and order didn't work at all, the light up sign is dark half the time so you cant even see it(is it broken or what, thats your advertising and its been like this for awhile) since the menu board wasnt working, you just waited till a gal came to the car, not quickly after you pushed the button 3 times. Took our order, read it back wrong, no total given, just someone came out and read off the wrong order, we corrected her and she didn't even know they had burritos on their menu. Our order had 3 things wrong, upped the size on wings, upped the slush size, but we didn't get a menu read back to observe and had our food in a bag. Mine was wrong, hubby was overcharge and given a large order, and I was given and charged for a large slush when I ordered a small. We couldn't push the button to notify anyone, drove in the drive through as it was late at night, gal was waiting before us saying HELLO over and over to the window, she pulled up and finally ran in as she got tired of waiting. We did get our order fixed, and a partial refund. The previous visit I also got the wrong breakfast burrito, hope you all get things straightened out over there."}
{"text":"Honestly we were so excited to go to Sonic and get our blasts like we used to years ago (hadn't been there in years). We were disappointed to hear they no longer have malt and from what we were told they will be getting rid of cookie dough too which is our favorite. I ordered a cookie dough blast without syrup and my husband got his the usual way. We also got two mini blasts for our kids. While ordering we indicated we'd like a drink carrier. 
When we received our order the cups were not in a carrier, the cookie dough blasts weren't labeled as to which one was different and one of the minis had a lopsided lid. I asked the girl for a carrier (again) and which cookie dough blast was which. She was so unhelpful and didn't offer to remake them since she didn't know. The lopsided lidded mini spilled all the way home dripping everywhere. May not sound like a big deal, but these four ice creams cost $19 and we were super disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrible. I went half an hour before they were supposed to close. I pulled up and pushed the button. Someone came on and rudely said \"we're closed!\" So I said, \"oh, what time do you guys close?\" And he never answered. They had just brought out food to the car next to me but wouldn't serve me. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I concur with the other reviews that say the employees here suck. They completely lack customer service skills which I blame the management for. We only come for drinks which are consistently good but almost every time we come, we scratch our heads at the complete disregard for customer service. Today for example; the guy says \"this is you, right?\" while handing over our drinks and then asks if we want our mints... Seriously??"}
{"text":"Dont kow about the food because I don't eat beef or fried chicken but their supposed real icecream creamery shakes are not good at all. 

1 a real shake is NOT light as air, i mean seriously it felt like nothing was in the cup it was so light.

2 it taste as though they use almost all whipcream and very little icecream.

I threw it away it was just so aweful.

Dont waste your money go to 31 or cold stone or subzero."}
{"text":"First off i gotta say, Sonic is my all time favorite for slushes and shakes. And i always hit sonic, i travel around quite a bit and i just happened to stumble up to this sonic. 

The manager was working the drive through, she was messing up an order before mine. I listened to the banter for about 5 minutes back and forth about how everything was wrong on the order. I then pulled up to the window and ordered a Banana Cream Pie Shake. She asked if i needed anything else and i said no. She then repeated my order back to me \"So one Coconut Cream Pie Shake\" i told her no. I wanted a banana cream pie shake. She then proceeded to argue with me that they didn't have a banana cream pie shake. They only had coconut. I told her i've been ordering banana cream pie shakes from sonic since i first went to sonic. She still insisted that this shake did not exist. I then told her never mind drove off and looked up the menu. Sure enough there is was...banana cream pie shake. Point is, watch your order carefully if you go to that sonic. But i never will again."}
{"text":"I just came back from this Sonic after months of not going for the same experience AGAIN! W ordered 2 Master Blasts & a Route 44 Strawberry Limeade. 15 minutes later; the slow walkimg teen handed the drink followed by melted icecream. I gave it back and went to Menchie's! Never ever again! Waste of time and money!"}
{"text":"I stopped there on my way home from work and, because there was a wait just sat in the line watching the employees. There were a couple of teen boys in the kitchen area without any Sonic uniform on eating food. They were also sharing it with the staff who put the food in their mouths and moved on to serving without washing their hands. The Coney that I received had very little chilie on it which seems to be standard for this location. The Tater Tots were soggy. In general I think that there should always be an adult supervisor in charge of a bunch of teens and because I don't need to be given EColi will not be going there again."}
{"text":"It's Sonic - so you get what is expected here! 

I love the lemon berry slushes, and sometimes I get cherry limeades. 

This location is on a super busy area, but the service is fast."}
{"text":"If I could give this location a negative star I would. I never knew they could make simple order so difficult. They young girl taking orders needs to be to be re-trained. The manager was dismissive and walked away without giving us his name. So unfortunate."}
{"text":"Worst sonic ever.  Full of idiots. Every time I go here I get the same \"sorry for the wait\" and they mess up my order every visit."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would.  I ordered the $5 boom box and the food was absolutely awful.  The tater tots were room temperature and had no salt, the chicago dog tasted like it had been under the warmer for 2 days, but the burger was the worst.  It was half the size of the bun and completely overcooked.  I don't know if they cooked old meat or had left it under the warmer too long or both, but I had to throw it out.  I wouldn't have even given it to my dog.  

Don't bother going here unless you like throwing money away."}
{"text":"Worst employees ever!!! I was ordering out of my car and a man came at me and instigating a fight. I ran to my car and the guy followed. I yelled at the sonic employee for help and they said they would and they didn't. They jut stood there and watch as me and my brothers were frantically  trying to call police while staying away from the man. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Good drinks, grilled cheese with tomatoes is amazing, lots of shake options and carhops are very friendly"}
{"text":"I had not been to Sonic in years, then I hit one up on my way home & it became a habit. The menu has SO MUCH on it & there are so many deals. The food is good and I am addicted to cheese fries and ocean water drinks. I did not get an ocean water drink the last visit, because the previous two I had were not the greatest. I am not sure if they changed, or my taste buds did. The carhop special is a SMOKING deal, so make sure to check it out."}
{"text":"I don't care for too much sonic but what i do like sometimes is the happy hour from 2-4 for the drinks.  Tater tots aren't too horrid either. I love the idea of the Texas toast with a burger patty and what not but i never tend to crave sonics so its rare for me to make a stop since Mcdonalds is half a mile away with obviously better deals than sonic."}
{"text":"So I tend to not go through drive thrus to most restaurants. However, I've been to this location so many times and what I always noticed is that they're so nice. For drive thru workers they always have a positive attitude. It makes me feel happy that for positive people working at the drive thru that they seem to be positive about preparing my food! Now, the main reason I'm writing this review is because of a man who served me tonight (July 22 at 2AM and I pull up to the window and forgot my wallet. Gentleman said \"no worries when you come back I'll have your food hot and ready for you!\" Note: that by this time it wast busy at all... by the time I came back the drive thru was so long and I was already so tired from today... finally pulled up to the intercom and let him know it was me who forgot my wallet, and he told me \"no worries just go ahead and pull up to slot 4 and I'll bring it out for you\" ... low and behold he did and I was out of there quick ... shout out to that man! Thank you!"}
{"text":"They know how to make a coconut cream pie shake!  I could taste the toasted coconut all through the shake - the way I expect it to be!  I don't do gluten but I love the drinks and shakes here.  Mid-afternoon treats never tasted so decadent!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time ever eating Sonic. My boyfriend and I ordered a ton of food with large drinks and the total was around 15 dollars! Are you kidding me cheap and good food? Yes please! The service in this location is very fast! We waited around 3-5 minutes. Overall I recommend the shakes here! So gooooood!"}
{"text":"We've been disappointed more times than we can count at this location. Three of my kids love cheeseburgers. 1 of them is vegan, I always order hers without the patty, just ketchup and cheese. We get home and all 3 burgers have no cheese! And a truck load of ketchup? It's happened so many times that we haven't been back. Thank my lucky stars we didn't eat those messy things in the car"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I loved the NY dog and cheese fries. Prompt and courteous service. I will be back."}
{"text":"Waited in the drive thru for 7 minutes for 1 order of tater tots. If I had not been starving after working 9 hours I would have left and gone to Wendy's across the street. Never again thanks."}
{"text":"Sonic is great. Great beverages and treats. This particular location is good. I have never had any issues with them."}
{"text":"No references to the Hedgehog, I'm sure. The food's.. ehh.. Everything taste better when you're hungry (& broke!). BUT!! Desserts & drinks.. Ah, yes, my child. That's what we're talking about when we talk about it! 2 WORDS: Butterfinger BLAST. Or maybe that's three? Ewan ko bro! Oh, you like drink, yeah? Fine. Strawberry limeade. & Half off drinks at happy hour?! SUPER COMBO: 287,869,000 points!"}
{"text":"Nearest Sonic and I usually go around their happy hour. Can't beat their specials around that time if you are quenching for some fountain drinks or slushes! I usually get the lemon berry slush, my favorite. Their root beer floats aren't that bad either. Staff is  nice and stay smiling when they come out with your order. Always a plus."}
{"text":"This place has been terrible the last three times I've gone for milk shakes.... The strawberries are always on the very bottom not mixed in very well at all and the last two times I've been here I've got the green tops in them yuck!  So not only did I have to mix my own shake but had to spit out lots of green strawberry tips.... I'm pretty sure they're not supposed to be in with the shake"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this sonic for years, and with being a fast food chain you get what you expect - mediocre service with average fast food. However, the past FOUR times I have visited this location I have left either empty handed or with the wrong items. Today when trying to order food, the attendant never answered the drive thru speaker so I was unable to ever even order. Honestly, with their food being average fast food, save your time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. The service was rude and we had to remind them about the half priced after 8 promotion that's plastered everywhere. When my boyfriend went to grab our drinks the lady let go of it before he could even touch it and it splashed on him and the car and when they made us a new one it was underfilled and they couldn't be bothered to finish making it and put whipped cream and toppings on which they did on the first one they ruined or even give us utensils or napkins. Overall really poor quality with really rude staff"}
{"text":"I really don't like Sonic. People hype it up to be the best fast food out there, but it's really nothing special. High prices, long waits- Not worth it. We specifically asked for no pickles on two of the burgers and there were indeed pickles on them. Paid damn near $30 for mediocre food. Kinda ridiculous if you ask me.

The one thing I absolutely love about Sonic though is their mozzarella sticks and the happy hour slushes. Other than that, I'd definitely choose another place over this."}
{"text":"In my opinion, I really like this place. The happy hour slushes are the best. There's so many to choose from and the prices are 50% off the original pricing. I think that's just unbeatable. I love the amount of variety there is. I mean, honestly, there's so many flavors to choose from. My favorites would have to be the blue raspberry slush with nerds in them and the Polynesian punch. They're super good. I also loved how kind the guy who served us was. His name was Leo! Cool guy and he came out with our drinks really quickly. I went to a Sonic in Tolleson and the girl took like 30 minutes just to come out with two small slushes.. Like what??? Lol. I definitely favor this one more! Mmm sonic! So good!"}
{"text":"I dont know who is running the place lately but its aweful now. I sat an waited and the guy yelled hello on the intercom then stopped talking all together. Finally left since nobody would come back on and take the order. Great drinks but crappy crappy service."}
{"text":"My old man was pretty excited to go to this new Sonic, and we actually made a thing out of it by driving by to check and see if they were open yet repeatedly.  Then one day I noticed they were finally open so I sent him over there.  

He got a burger and some tater tots.  After he had eaten, I asked how it was, and he said \"well, the tater tots were good, but it was pretty spendy for such mediocrity.\"  

Two weeks later he went again and brought home the goods.  Again, the food was subpar, unripe tomatoes, wilted lettuce, and they somehow managed to suck all the flavor out of their over priced food.  

Another reviewer mentioned that Culvers is better, and they are right.  Maybe, hopefully, they'll turn things around after they've been up and running for a while.  But I'm not holding my breath on that one.

A dream has been crushed here people."}
{"text":"Must read!

Went to get slushes from them got home and going ants in all 6 slushes I ordered. I'm irritated i called and couldn't get a manager. DONT GET SLUSHES FROM THERE"}
{"text":"The night crew tonight wasn't so great. Food took a while for the car ahead of us as well as our order. They also gave us the wrong order. Looked in the window n there was about 5 of them standing around talking story. No wonder our order was incorrect. The food they gave us was also cheaper then the ones ordered. :( fail on the night manager."}
{"text":"Just got our food order pretty messed up. Ordered 2 dub cheeses, 2 grilled cheeses got the grilled, but single cheeseburgers. Wasn't charged for doubles at least. 3rd friend ordered some combo with chicken strips, tater tots and onion rings. Received 1 onion rings, chicken strips were popcorn chicken, but not necessarily the cooks fault or the waiter. No sauce though asked specifically which one. All small f*** ups, but alot of them. Cook is just incompetent. Waiter was awesome though."}
{"text":"This Sonic is inside of a Walmart , which is convenient. The chocolate malt milkshake and chocolate hot fudge sundaes we're great. Service was fast and friendly. Would come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"Big fan of Sonic, originally for their burgers, corn dogs, chocolate cokes, and especially their onion rings (which to me are the tastiest of any fast food place I've tried). Then I started trying their breakfast, and was surprised by how good their coffee tastes (branded as \"Red Button Roast\", made with 100 percent Arabica beans and possibly a Douwe Egbert blend per Googling). For me, the best coffee I've ever found at a fast-food place, very smooth, non-bitter, and never seems to have that burned, \"end of the pot\" taste.  Usually have a yummy sausage \"Toaster\" for breakfast (kind of a grilled cheese with scrambled eggs). I really loved their toasters on French Toast bread, but sadly those got discontinued. Sonic offers their entire menu even at breakfast, so you can even have a burger or hot dog etc. in the morning if mood strikes you.

Sonic has great specials, deals on sodas before 10 AM and from 2-5 PM (when their yummy corn dogs are also on sale).  Making this particular location 5 stars for me is the customer service, especially Brooke J.  She is super friendly, meticulous about getting your order right before and after, extra effort like making sure your coffee lid is on tight and won't spill, and remembers frequent customers with a smile. She works both the drive-thru and the parking stalls, and has an extra bounce in her step (or skates LOL) and is the type who hustles at her work even when no-one is watching :-).  A previous Yelper also commended Brooke and even called her \"Bumble Bee Brooke\" for her hustle LOL.  Cheers to Sonic, Brooke J, and this location!"}
{"text":"TLDR: roller skating carhops; drive-thru open late; iffy service; happy hour available

Sonic Drive-Ins pride themselves on providing an enriching experience with every visit. I think they miss the bar at this location. 

The food and drinks are standard and came out as expected. I always try to make an effort to attend during happy hour and get a Route 44 strawberry limeade or lemon berry slush paired with a corn dog as a midday pick-me-up. 

The service was...interesting. I was greeted by an individual with cornrows who appeared to be bothered by the day. Maybe it's the heat, or the other customers, but she needed to wash her face because she got that dirty look on there and it definitely was not intended for me. Additionally, I'm gonna need these carhops to calm down. I almost hit one with my car as they zoomed by in the crosswalk. I hope they don't get hit. 

All-in-all an okay experience. I rate it between 3/3.5 stars. I would return if in the area."}
{"text":"Waited in the drive thru line for 35 minutes with three cars ahead of us for a chicken sandwich and a slush. When we finally got our order from the pickup window we were handed a hamburger. Definitely never coming here again."}
{"text":"So we finally have a Sonic in San Diego albeit in Santee. I have never eaten at Sonic before and whilst in Vegas as luck would have it, the Sonic sign was staring me down from across the hotel I was staying at.

In my opinion to experience the \"hype\", do not visit this establishment on foot. I crossed the street from the hotel and ordered food to go (another no-no). I got burger, fries, and drink. That is all what I remember. Maybe I should have tried the delectable selections of milk shake. So back to the burger and fries, it was alright. The question now is would it have tasted better if I was in the car? I believe experiencing the old fashioned service? Maybe, I would try it again this time ordering from the car. 

I am going to visit again and perhaps update my review but for now this place get a \"three\". Until next time Sonic."}
{"text":"So annoyed
Took forever in the drive thru for two simple sonic blast-- maybe it's because all the employees including the manager was just chatting by the drive thru window 
No line at all
And when we got are sonic blast that we waited forever for the toppings where all piled on the top instead of blended in---- so basically I waited 15 minutes for you to make me two vanilla ice creams  wow
So over sonic--- I will always be returning to Dairy Queen 
That's what I get for trying something new"}
{"text":"Worst Sonic ever! Service is slow, taters tasted oily and my hamburger bun was dry. Not very busy on a busy street, now I know why!!"}
{"text":"Girls are friendly. However After 3 attempts they still didn't get my order right. AND I ordered a combo yet they charged me Ala cart...WT..."}
{"text":"This place is terrible!! First of all, the service is so slow and when you finally receive your food, it is cold. I took a picture of the cheeseburger I ordered...... how is that ever acceptable???? It was also served cold. I will never return, and hope others who see this picture follow suit- just terrible"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through for some breakfast. First thing I was greeted with was a very unfriendly staff, not even hello. The young lady never even smiled! Seems like she just hates her job, or me. Anyways, I ordered 2 breakfast burritos, one with no cheese. The speed of gettin the food was good and they got my order correct, which surprised me cause they have always gotten it wrong. The burritos Tasted ok, not highly recommended."}
{"text":"Their commercials are everywhere, but I had to go to Arizona to actually try some.

It's not bad, but it wasn't that great either. I got the #5: a Bacon Cheeseburger Toaster with tots and a drink ($6.29). The burger was alright. The tots seemed a bit dry.

Are we supposed to tip the waiters that rollerblade to your car window?? I think that was the first time I ever gave a tip at a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Once again this Sonic has managed not  to meet my very low expectations to begin with. After repearing/correcting my order it was still wrong. How freaking hard is it to make iced tea, for God's sake you live in the south. I except tea not something that looks like dingy dish water. I sick and tired of the lack of quality control from this business if owner doesn't care they need to sell this business. Spend your money on cheap food some where else."}
{"text":"So I always come here to get the same drinks and their customer service is generally really great. But there were a few instances in the drive through with Mikea who has been really rude. The first time we were ordering a drink, we just wanted to clarify that we wanted light ice, she gave us attitude saying she already got that and if we wanted anything else. Today I politely asked if she could re-make my drink (large cherry limeade) because it was bland and we couldn't taste any flavor. She followed up by saying even though she squeezes the lime in the drink we might not even taste it. That wasn't my point and we just wanted it to be remade. She took the drink back and gave us dirty looks through the window as she was making the drink. When we got the drink back and we politely said thank you. She didn't say anything back and just gave us a dirty look. This would be a 5 star rating if it wasn't for her rude customer service."}
{"text":"Actually the food only gets 3 stars, but when you add the incredible assortment of drinks, shakes, and slushies, then they get at least one more!
We stop in for slushies and chili-cheese tater-tots more often than anything else.  (But the foot-long conies are good too!)
I enjoy the drive-in thing too, too few of them left."}
{"text":"A very sad place.  I was in line at 4 for 15 min just so I could get out of line bc it took so long ! 15 min and still 6 cars ahead....."}
{"text":"Failed to provide condiments as ordered and listed on the sales receipt. Sonic failed to provide ranch for chicken tenders and marinara for cheese sticks. Read the receipt people!!  Also, ordered 4 ocean waters. Three were slushies and one was correctly made with Sprite and blue coconut. Seems like no one is checking orders for accuracy or quality."}
{"text":"It's Sunday noon, you're ready to do that long 4 hour drive back home and you're starving. You don't want to spend anymore money especially after a weekend of ASS kicking the casinos gave you. 

Don't fret, Sonic Burger will be there to comfort you. Try a double Sonic burger with everything. Or how about a Toaster Chicken sandwich? MMMMMM.......sweet onion rings and nothing like soggy chili fries.  Drown those sorrows with a Strawberry slush. 

As you leave Vegas full, you realized you just gave up your last $20 and you fall into depression again. Raise your fist out your car window and scream: \"I'll be back bitches!\""}
{"text":"Good for finger food, shakes and snacks. Sometimes the order takes a little long but they have tasty shakes and slushees."}
{"text":"Oh, I like Sonic. Beat me with a wet noodle. I made Darren take me to one on Memorial Day weekend since it had been years. I liked the breakfast burrito I had (You can also order breakfast all day) as well as the milkshake (their ice cream is sooo good). It's a retro and fun place to go and reminds me of Jerry's Curb Side in Bridgewater. The service is great and I like their intercom system."}
{"text":"Good sonic food. Nothing special but haven't had any issues with poor food or service. Drive through services slightly longer than a Burger King but better quality food."}
{"text":"Fast service, okay food. I've tried this location multiple times, but food quality ranges from bad to okay. My beloved tatter tots are never cooked to perfection, they just can't seem to find a happy medium here- they're either under or overcooked. On the plus side, their ice cream sundae is yummy, but melts fast on the way home unless you eat it and drive!"}
{"text":"The POOREST customer service ever. Just stopped by to get something cool and refreshing to drink and the gal in the drive through was so rude and uninterested in taking our order. She wasn't paying attention, she kept getting it wrong and saying what , what, what. She is too busy doing other things. I was in a drive through lane and traffic started backing up. My husband went in and tried to express his frustration to the manager and he could care less. He said sorry there is nothing he can do about it. I thinking seriously, your drive through representation has bad bad customer service and you could care less. I refused my order and didn't buy anything because they will not get a dime of my money!!!"}
{"text":"Convenient, close to home, fast service...what's not to like? At least once a month I ask my Peekaboo, \"Want to go in the car?\"... followed by an adorable tail wag. So, off we go to the local Sonic for mozerella sticks and the foot long Coney Island chili dog."}
{"text":"Had to stop by Sonic before leaving Arizona.
I don't like writing reviews on chains but I had to for Sonic.
tater tots with chili. yum."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've eaten at a Sonic.  What drew me in was a coupon in the mail for 2 for 1 premium Hot Dogs.  They have a new menu of premium Hot Dogs and they looked very tempting, so I grabbed my coupon and headed for this location.

I decided to order:

Chicago Hot Dog

Cheeseburger

Since I'm a big fan of Chicago Dogs, I went for the Chicago Hot Dog first.  Based on it's appearance, it looked promising.....except the Relish wasn't colored Car Coolant Green like the real Dogs in Chicago.  I took a bite and was pleased.....it was \"close\", very close to a real Chicago Dog.

Next up was the New York Dog.  It was OK, not as good as the Chicago Dog.

The Burger was OK too......better than most fast food joints.

The one weird thing about this restaurant location is that if you decide to dine inside, you order through a phone and someone from the back brings it out to you.....strange, very strange.

Overall, not a bad fast food option.  Will come back for the Dogs again.  Gave it 4 Stars.....was really rounding up from 3.5.

Return Factor - 77%"}
{"text":"We went to this location because it was on the way home. This location is a lot slower. The wait time is a lot longer than other locations. The shakes tastes different to. While we order the women would have a long pause. We didn't know if she left but we continue ordering. The woman who took our order was rude. When we asked for a cup of water she just said what to us."}
{"text":"I'm normally not a fast food diner, but when you're pregnant and hungry at odd times of the night, a shake really does sound incredible, you want it now and you don't care where it's from. 

My hubby tells me that Sonic is close by and we can stop for a shake. I haven't eaten at a Sonic in years and remembered that they have chili cheese fries back in my high school days! Oh, that sounds freaken good too! So we get to the place and go through their drive thru. I order a medium chili cheese fries and a peanut butter fudge shake. Both items hit the spot!!! I only wish I ordered a large or an extra large for my chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"I have no idea why Sonic only has two stars.

For some reason, I've always lived by a Sonic..so it's my go to fast food joint. It's quick and the burgers are just a bit better than McD/BK/Wendy's etc.

How can you go wrong with onion rings and tater tots?! 

And every drink flavor under the sun! 

Plus, outdoor seating and free wifi?!?!

And carhops!!!"}
{"text":"So beyond terrible. First, I went thru the drive thru and waited for 3 minutes while someone finally answered me. She was rude and acted as if I was bothering her. I only ordered one simple thing! Second, after pulling up to the stop sign where it says to wait for order, I waited and waited and waited! Someone even came thru the drive thru after me received there order and still nothing. After 10 min (I am being serious) I went up to the door and the girl in there refused to even acknowledge me after looking right at me. Third, she finally got a manger or someone who was willing to help me. This girl couldn't have been more than 20, she comes to the door and says can I help you. I said did you forget me and she replies with what was your order? I tell her and she says it will be a few minutes and slams the door in my face! No apology, nothing! I left! Please don't waist your time here people!"}
{"text":"Customer service was great, but our food came out cold and our drinks were not blended properly. We addressed one of the workers and she took care of the issue immediately."}
{"text":"The management is a joke and she is very rude. When my disability partner when to pick up food she made him feel like he was an inch tall. Plus, she treated my allergies like nothing. I called her boss and he has yet to get back to me.for both this issue I had."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about here! 5 stars for half price drinks after 8, super cheap but yummy tater tots, and quick service. Yum!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the worst chili cheese and Shake I've ever had in my life I'll leave it at that. The pretzel bun was even stale. Don't think I'll be stopping by there again"}
{"text":"I won't be back to this location ever again! Went last night around 7:40. By 8 we still didn't have our order. . . . THREE blasts! The car pull up stalls were empty and there was 3 cars in front of us. Pull up to the window and there was no less than 8 teenage children running the place. Not a grown up in sight. I look behind us and there are about 4 or 5 other cars and the staff are walking outside serving them their orders. Orders of food! So it took 20 minutes to bring me one of the 3 ice cream orders yet they managed to cook food orders that were placed after mine!? After getting my first blast and waiting longer for the others I told the kid at the window I wanted a refund he ignored me and closed the window. 3 or more standing next to the window doing absolutely nothing except talking and fidgeting. I had to beep my horn to get attention from them. Then some young kids who didn't look older than 17 gave me a receipt for a refund. I couldn't believe the amount of help they had yet no one was working. They were literally standing around taking. Paying a bunch of teenagers to work but do nothing!"}
{"text":"It's a sonic what do you expect lol. Good service and very courteous staff but the bathroom looked horrible... but again it's a sonic so I didn't expect it to be clean."}
{"text":"Sent my kids to sonic last night to pick up blasts for us. They wanted dq, but it's pretty far away. Kids always complained that they never put any ingredients in them. I told them all you have to do is order it with extra. Big mistake, there was about 2 spoon fulls on top of butterfinger and thats it. It was like a large cup full of soft serve with sprinkles on top. They don't compare at all with a dq blizzard."}
{"text":"Tough to access when coming east on Elliot. Love this Sonic! Not usually busy, but then there's happy hour. Always friendly service and fairly fast. I come here often. 

Tator tots are great, corn dogs & drink selection is of the best! My regular favs."}
{"text":"Second single star rating for a Sonic within a week and in different states. Has there been a bungled update to their ordering system!?!? Waited 15 minutes in the drive thru for a diet cherry Coke Zero. Folks behind me with full meals were being served and driving around me.I left, again, without my order. This issue seems to be company wide so it begs the question what else is being neglected?"}
{"text":"Visit drive through 5/3/18. 

Order a LARGE strawberry limeade and a MINi onion rings. Got to the window....guy takes my card hands me a medium drink....Closes window....runs my card....comes back to the window and hands me my receipt. I ask \"is this a LARGE strawberry limeade? He goes \"I rang up a medium\" did not offer to make a new drink spite of his miss understanding or the poor radio communications or something. Hands me the onion rings...Took my stuff and left! Onion rings were overdone (burned oil) and poor service at the window on drinks. I will not return.  Sorry Sonic up your game and customer service. This is very sad to see in a brand new location that is under a year old. Customer service should be at the core! Also the $2.39 that he charged me for the medium was much more than they charge for the large drinks.

Where is the leadership in this location?"}
{"text":"Only giving this one star because I can't select zero stars. It took over 20 minutes to get two number one meals, two kids meals, and one number three combo. The burgers were not thoroughly cooked, the fries and tater tots were disgusting; as if they were cooked in oil that hasn't been changed in years, and the entire order was cold. You would think with all the time we waited the entire meal would be fresh and hot! You can sense no one really cares about the customer experience! Incidentally, there were only two other customers in the parking lot being served.  That should been a sign!! 

I will never return to this location or any Sonic location."}
{"text":"Some chick Liz brought out our food, brought 1 straw for 2 drinks and grumbled about how she just wants to go home. Real professional Liz! 

The card reader was broken at the drive-in so we waited for far too long to come back. Still didn't have the straw. Took her 3 trips to get a 2 dog / 2 drink order.....her closing remarks were once again mumbles quickly under her breath but I'm 90% sure she said some shit about us overpaying. Shut your trap and get back to your shitty job Liz. 

Great job with your hiring process Sonic! And fix your goddamn card readers, why do they never work? this review deserves zero stars."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst sonic I have ever been to.  We pulled into a stall pushed the button, ordered 2 limeades. We had to repeat the order 6 times!!!! How difficult is it to punch in two drinks? Every time I have come here we have had issues with the orders being wrong, it doesn't seem to matter whether it's food or drinks."}
{"text":"Tried to go in and get food and it just wasn't happening. My corndog was cool, and I suspect it sat in the heat sink a long time,  because it wasn't fried. 
The upside? Their generosity with the condiments was amazing   salt ketchup mustard. Anything to cover up the squishy texture."}
{"text":"Never tried Sonic before. Got a double bacon cheeseburger and a chili cheese dog. Nothing that 'blew my mind'. I'm sure ill go there again, just won't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"Sonic is.....well....Sonic. Nothing particularly impressive. Although it's the only fast food place that i'm aware of that offers tater tots. I used to live in Texas and there is a Sonic on just about every corner, but this was my first time seeing one with a drive-thru. Although idk why they have a drive-thru when they take your order and do exactly the same thing when you pull up to the regular car ports. Weird. Only item on the menu particularly satisfying would have to be their Slushies they are quite tasty and come in a assortment of flavors."}
{"text":"This place is so incredibly slow I will never come back. It always takes them 10 minutes. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Last night I stopped by for a quick treat. The guy who worked the drive thru, was so sweet! I wish I caught his name. He even gave my dog a treat! A little out of my way, but I will go back just to get great customer service!"}
{"text":"Major disappointment. The best part is being able to peruse the menu and order when you're comfortable, and sit there and wait patiently and not feel hurried. It ends there.

I ordered two kids meals, one with grilled cheese and the other a hot dog. I asked for the hotdog to have everything on it. What I got was a piece of soft rubber with no flavor and not even cut in half. The hot dog had nothing on it and there was not so much as a packet of ketchup and mustard in the bag. Only one had a child's gift which was nothing more than a cheap sticker. Fortunately you couldn't ruin the applesauce and apple juice. I got a large order of mozzarella sticks, and really nice to only give me one marinara sauce and they didn't ask because I probably would have preferred ranch dressing. Just down the street from me, I doubt I'll give it a second chance"}
{"text":"Every time I am craving for a slush on a hot sunny day. Their slushy Machine is always broken !!! For the past month every time I go. It's always broken. Today I decided to give it a shot and go get a slush and might be lucky that their slushy machine was working. Guess what ? The slush machine was not working AGAIN !"}
{"text":"Just came through the drive thru. Waiting 20 minutes in line to order, then ordered a lg strawberry slush with jolly Ranchers and a lg vanilla fanta slush. Then waited another 10 minutes in the line. The people in front of us, drove off because they were tired of waiting as well. We pay $9 and some odd ball change for 2 slushes. After we left, my mom goes to drink her slush. There was no flavoring in the slush what So ever. It was just the blended ice and jolly rancher pieces. 

I call the store to let them know. Someone answers the phone \"hi\". Which was very unprofessional might I add, I had to ask to make sure I was actually on the phone with sonic. Needless to say, I spoke to someone named Megan who just continued to make excuses. We will not be back."}
{"text":"This location is a little hit or miss for me. Their happy hour specials are a great deal, and I usually get a slushie. The service is just fine, not particularly fast or slow. Unfortunately I've gotten a few weird slushies - ones that clearly didn't have any flavor. They were a strange gray color and didn't taste like what they were supposed to. I suppose for 1.50$ you can't be super picky..."}
{"text":"I had my first Sonic burger yesterday.  It wasn't what I expected it to be but it was good.  The Sonic Blast w/ Reese's was damn good though!"}
{"text":"It's Sonic... it's a chain... so the food is rather predictable. Love me some jalapeno poppers - the best are here! 

The crew is always super-friendly, and among the dozen or so times we've hit this location, I've yet to get a wrong order. That is a huge plus in my book, these days, sadly. 

Thumbs up for a great job!"}
{"text":"This was my first time and I will be back Jonathan was big help he had the food out real quick I would recommend coming here"}
{"text":"This was first time here and will be the last time the guy who was taking are order try to over charge me I would not recommend coming here unless you wanna get rip off and over charge"}
{"text":"Very horrible workers order grilled cheese sandwich they weren't even cooked and stuff people in charge didn't give a flying fuck I'm never eating here again"}
{"text":"Writing this after I had to switch to 3 different spots because they would not respond to me pressing the red button and I know for a fact it's not because it was out of order as the card before me just placed an order. 

All I ordered was a small slush but I waited 15+ minutes just to get it. I guess they still had to go out and pick the fruit. 

Usually love sonic slushes which is why I'm giving it two stars but honestly service is everything."}
{"text":"I love Sonic, especially the happy hour.  But this particular location just seems to keep getting worse and worse with their service.  I feel like I always wait at the drive-thru longer than going to the car hop, and whoever works at the drive-thru window always seems to hate their job, especially the women.  I understand the need for having a job to pay the bills, but jeez, make the most of it and don't be rude to people who don't deserve it.  There have also been a few times where they'll keep my loose change.  It's not much, just a few cents here and there, but that's just bad cashiering, unless they do that all day and collect it.  Either way, I avoid this location.  I'm tired of their horrible service."}
{"text":"For the most part I great pretty good service at this location.  They get my order correct, and I usually don't have to wait.  If there's a line in the drive-thru, it does go by pretty slow, so I'll just park it and my order comes by pretty quickly.  Sometimes the people at the drive-thru have a hard time understanding what I want (I tired to buy just a gift card, and that seemed to be a tricky thing to understand), but all in all it's not horrible."}
{"text":"Awful sonic. Waited over 10 minutes at the drive thru, no one answering... Clearly we're workers not doing their jobs. Try elsewhere waste of my dam time"}
{"text":"This Sonic is the worst. Slow service and unpleasant staff. I waited in the drive thru line for 20 mins for three drinks! When I got to the window they didn't even say hi or anything."}
{"text":"If I could do 0 stars, I would. Orders were wrong 1st and 2nd time. Nobody else eating here and they still couldn't get it right. And no apologies. They are just not too bright."}
{"text":"Who thinks of breakfast when you think of Sonic!! Absolutely me. I usually go to sonic for the Cherry limeade my favorite, tots an chili dogs, but not this time. So French toast lover that I am I decided to try the French toast sticks an wholly Moses I'm glad I did. They are the best French toast sticks since jack in the box which doesn't have them anymore. They are full of cinnamon goodness. An they smell as good as they taste. This has become my new favorite fast food French toast stop. I have also tried the breakfast sandwiches an they are great as well. So longer is sonic just my cherry limeade place. So if you haven't tried them for breakfast you should. Everyone is always friendly an I get great service. An if it's busy the line always moves fast."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this! I mainly love Sonic for their RT66 Dr. Pepper with vanilla during happy hour but my sweet 3 yr old was hungry when he got out of preschool. I went through the Sonic drive thru and bought him a hot dog kids meal. We got home to have this hot dog that looks like it was microwaved. Very poor quality. Very sad and definitely lowers my thoughts of Sonic"}
{"text":"Only thing good about Sonic is their drinks.
Any and everytime I've ever tried any of their food items, it has absolutely failed - here, Cali, anywhere. Don't do it - unless you're super thirsty!"}
{"text":"Best vanilla shakes.

When I'm in a junk food mood Sonic rocks.  Their shakes are better than In & Outs.  The mozzarella sticks rival those found at White Castle's on the the East Coast (see: http://www.yelp.com/list/white-castle-jersey-city )   Since my family lives in this area, I'm always sneaking away to Sonics to grab a shake..."}
{"text":"I love frozen drinks and ice cream!  So Delicious :)

With that said I was Not impressed with this location!

Must of had a bad batch of Slush!

I got a cherry frozen drink and the flavor was good until it rant out and did not last all the way through to the bottom of the drink!  So Sad!

I do not recommend this location and I would search for a Dairy Queen \"Cant go wrong\" Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Thank you to Jesus for providing  great customer service and accuracy of my 3 separate orders. Job well done."}
{"text":"I use to go to this location several times a week.  i love the cherry lime ade and Root Beer Float... when i order the root beer float i always get extra ice cream... i don't care that they charge me... i will pay for what i want... but they have gotten extremely cheap and want to charge me for 2 root beer floats just for extra ice cream... not only that, they have the slowest service i have ever encountered at a FAST FOOD place... i typically sit in the drive thru for 20-25 minutes... which is why i never go to this location anymore... plus the staff is rude."}
{"text":"First of all, if I could give a rating solely based on Limeade, this place would be four stars....but alas, I cannot.

The food here is ridiculously bad. Yep. That's all I can say about that.

BUT, the beverages are great(and half price between 2-4 EVERY DAY), and the frozen treats are good too. A buck for a soft serve cone? Yes please! I recently ordered a Coconut Cream Pie Shake, and almost went into sugar shock. Good, but holy crap! 


So, in review: Sonic is a great place to grab a Happy Hour beverage or a sweet treat, but save your food dollars(and your car upholstery) and eat a real meal!"}
{"text":"Nothing makes a louder statement than when you come here and pay with a one hundred dollar bill."}
{"text":"I really like this Sonic location.

There's plenty of stalls to pull into, a walk-up board with some outside seating, and a drive-thru for on the go.

We received our order within about 15 minutes and it was 100% accurate and piping hot. They also included plenty of napkins and plastic cutlery. They do not seem to include ketchup unless you ask, so be mindful of that.

I got the slinger (burger patty made of almost 30% mushrooms to cut down on the fat/calorie content. I really enjoyed it, could not taste much of a difference! I think it's a great option for those looking for something a bit healthier (though come on, it's still not healthy)! 

I think the prices are really good for the quality and size of the portions. Everything tastes fresh and flavorful, and the quality is more like a burger restaurant instead of a fast food joint.

I will be back again because I've always had delicious food with great customer service!"}
{"text":"Went to try those pretzel hotdogs, and the bun was all moldy. Didn't notice until halfway through, so yay for a dose of penicillin."}
{"text":"I'm a total sucker for Sonic. I know I know. Fast food is fast food, and it's never \"good\" or \"healthy.\" Fine. But if you're going to drive thru, drive thru here. 

The thousand island burger is tough to beat and the specialty drinks are also hard to come by. For example, where else in town are you going to find a cherry-limeade? At 1 in the morning? 

It even occassionally passes the girlfriend test as she gets cravings for Sonic grilled cheese. You can substitute tater tots for fries free of charge and let those greasy little golden nuggets soak up the booze from a long night of drinkin. 

Shakes are bomb, desserts are money, and everything is cheap. 

Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to Jake's Guilty Pleasure #1: Sonic Drive-In."}
{"text":"The staff made this experience 100% unenjoyable. Every time I said something the staff would sigh or just stare blankly at me putting forth 0 effort to make this experience enjoyable. Not only was the staff curt and unkind, my order was also wrong and my drink tasted watered down. I would rather spend gas money going to another location then to ever go back to this sass factory."}
{"text":"This is my first and last time coming to this location. I came for a drink and a corn dog. It took them over 15 minutes to bring my order. An older woman brought out my order. She seemed irritated before I even rolled my window down. I asked for ketchup and mustard. She told me all I'm going to get is ketchup because they just had corn dog day and they are all out of mustard. She handed me two packets of ketchup and asked if that was enough. Well I guess so since she only came out to my car with two packets. She provided very poor customer service. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Tyler did a great job delivering my order! Not often do I see the roller skates anymore but he gon step! He was very timely, repeated my order to make sure it was 100% and overall had a good sense of kindness in him. I made sure to give him a great tip. Maybe you should have him train some other employees with his fantastic customer service skills."}
{"text":"Food was so cold that the cheese in the cheese sticks was frozen and the food is stale and rock hard impossible to eat."}
{"text":"Got to this location 20 minutes before closing, we were the only ones there. ordered 3 concrete blasts and all of them were halfway melted."}
{"text":"Easily the worst Sonic I've been to. I came here because Dairy Queen wasn't open and man should I have just stayed home. The employee taking our order was very rude after I corrected her when she misstated our order. Food took forever to be brought to car and my Sonic Blast(Their version of a Blizzard) was given to me with a straw(yeah, let my sip on these butterfinger chunks) and no spoon. Despite me correcting them and the food taking forever, they still managed to butcher our order. I will not return to THIS Sonic."}
{"text":"Happy hour from 2-5pm for slushies and 8-midnight for shakes."}
{"text":"The food is always fine but they are always slow. I don't know why because they are slow even when it's not busy."}
{"text":"Just your average Sonic, not really different than any other. Sonic really excels at cold drinks: slushes, shakes, and the famous Route 44 Cherry Limeade! The Sonic app is really handy for paying with a mobile device. I use my iPhone to pay every time I visit."}
{"text":"I had my first Sonic orange slush and tots nearly 22 years ago in South Carolina and things haven't changed. The tots are as crisp and tasty and the slush as brain freeze worthy as ever.
Some things never change.
Order was taken seconds from hitting the button and the order was out minutes later. No complaints at all. Ever really. Never had a bad experience.
Great spot."}
{"text":"Yay for being open on Thanksgiving! And happy hour even on Thanksgiving..made the last minute run to the store more bearable. Not only did I get the happy hour price I got a free rt. 44 coupon on my receipt!

Double Score!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Sonic's throughout the Southwest. This might be the best one of them all. Sonic  is reasonably consistent wherever you go, so perhaps it's the staff here that makes it a stand out. There are times, as other Yelpers have mentioned, when there are lots of boisterous teen-agers present, but they are harmless, and at times, their antics can be quite amusing. Been eating here 2 years and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Pretty nice and new for a Sonic, but it's understaffed and was having bad technical issues when we were there for a quick drink. We tried parking, the drive thru and eventually just walked up to order. The guy next to us had paid for his order and had been waiting for over half an hour. I felt bad for the employees, they were doing the best they could-- but something needs to be fixed. Our order was wrong when we got it but wasn't worth the hassle to fix it. The only reason I gave it more than one star is because they gave us our drinks for free for the wait. Probably won't be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad enough that the place was filthy (tables and outside eating area ground), garbage overflowing from the garbage cans, and the food was all cold even though we ate there...no, the deal breaker was no refills on the drinks! WHAT??? We ordered one cheeseburger, one New York hotdog, and a double cheeseburger meal...just over $15.00. Never again!"}
{"text":"Sonic or Sonic wish there was one closer to me in the Bay Area! haha

Always stop by here at least once when we come to visit for late nite snacks/drinks..
Love the drive-in and park without getting out of my car and the workers who roll out 
in their skates!!

Long live Sonic.. lol"}
{"text":"This location cannot get an order right to save their life. I order the same thing every time. I try and get a #1 with NO CHEESE. I ask for a hamburger. They read it back to me, the person that brings the food out reads it back to me, and yet every single time I check the burger it has cheese on it. I have spoken with the manager and he's apologized on a few occasions, but seems unable to improve the quality control of these workers."}
{"text":"This sonic has some of the best drinks I've yet to try their food but I'm sure it's good."}
{"text":"Just 1 word that can describe there \"Buffalo wings\"....


RETCHED! AWEFUL! HORRENDOUS!

Ok... Make that 3 words lol

The chicken is mushy, no crunch on the batter.... Just to name a couple of things. Tasted like they were MICROWAVED!"}
{"text":"The drive-thru at this location is HORRIBLE. You pull up and they don't even greet you promptly. I said hello four or five times before somebody responded. Then they were extremely short with their responses. I am not usually one to complain and I understand that working in fast food can be chaotic, but there's no excuse for a lack of customer service. I don't think I will be back to this location."}
{"text":"I'm halfway between this location and the one in Chandler on Ray Rd. This location is consistently slower by a longshot. My current receipt was entered at 12:47 and I didn't receive my food until 1:04. That's simply too long to wait. On top of that their breakfast burritos have far less cheese than other locations and are consequently dry as the desert. To get into the parking lot you have to cross a couple of speed bumps on a dilapidated road and the majority of their card readers are broken. I've never had an issue with any of the carhops but that isn't really much of a consideration for me given how brief those encounters are, hence the 1 star review. If you have another Sonic thats not too far, use that one instead"}
{"text":"As we rode in the back seat of the car down a street in Buckeye that I can't remember the name of, I saw a bunch of neon glowing around a building in the distance.  I asked the man driving, \"What's that off in the distance there?\"

He looked slightly confused for a second. \"With all the neon?\"

The neon was pretty much the only thing you could see across the dark desert night. \"Yes.\"

\"That's a Sonic,\" he said.

Now, I live in Chicago. I see commercials near everyday for Sonic, but there aren't any within 100 miles of here. Why they torture Chicagoans with images of yummy food, tasty drinks, and ice cream desserts that we would have to travel for hours upon hours to get, I know not. Here was my chance though. I could finally have some Sonic. I asked him to stop there, and he did.

It's a 50s-inspired drive-in! I don't see too many drive-ins around anymore. You pull into a spot next to a menu with a speakerbox. You place your order. A person who works there brings it out to you on a special tray that goes over your window. Very cool.

We got burgers and a corndog and sundaes and other stuff too. It was all good. The service was good. I greatly enjoyed my first Sonic experience, and I look forward to getting to one again on future travels."}
{"text":"Dear Diary, 

It has been 379 days since my last slip.  I tried so hard and it all seemed so innocent...

Oh, you are oh so convenient with your bright, inviting lights & 24 hour drive \"thru\" .  Then that friendly voice welcomes me to Sonic & I request to wait, since I just pulled up.  After a few moments of hesitation between a foot long chili cheese Coney & a breakfast burrito, I do what all addicts do: I order BOTH.  Then, as I pull up, can't help but notice the condescending gaze of the attendant as she looks down into my little toy of a car, while being spotlighted in an even brighter, almost judging, light. 

So, it all goes to plan, I have my stash of breakfast burrito and a tube steak in a boat of bread, meat gravy, & cheese whiz.  All packed with care?  I get home and spread it all out in front of the TV.  Bathed in the otherworldly glow of some Amazon Prime original series, I attack my chili dog with the nearly useless plastic fork.

The traditional method for consuming this \"Coney\" starts with tearing the foil paper & breaking open the front of the paper trough so you can try to bite this cheesy, greasy, chili covered 12 incher. I use the fork to stab & break off a piece so big, I nearly gag.  I think to myself, \"Oh, the price I have to pay will be well worth my time.\"  How could I be so wrong?

Since I am on a roll & feeling so good about myself, I tear into the steaming hot breakfast burrito.  I swear the little plastic packets of mustard & salsa mock me from the bottom of the bag.  Now, I finally realize, I have relapsed.  There is no turning back.  I will continue to eat & defile myself and probably wake up behind a Whole Foods wondering how my life came to this...

I wake up a few hours later.  
I feel dirty.
As I belch, it feels like gasoline is issuing forth from my pores...
This morning, I start afresh.
I will try to pull my life together.  
Again.  
And this time, 
maybe,
I will remember my hallowed mantra: 

ONLY GO TO SONIC FOR DRINKS AT HAPPY HOUR"}
{"text":"Been here twice, now, for a late night dinner 
Both times we had the Chicken Sandwich and Island Fire nuggets 
Very consistent and good quality product at reasonable price point. 
The chicken sandwich is of much superior quality then its competitors, like McDonalds or BK, and the Island Fire nuggets are seriously good. 
Service is good too, only challenge is the drive thru is very narrow, so be careful when you pull in.
REcomended QSR on Sahara"}
{"text":"Took my daughter there today for the 1/2 slushes happy hour from 2-5.  We got two drinks for $2.  The ordering was easy, as was the payment with the credit card.  The delivery of the order was quick.  I had a limeberry real fruit slushe and she had a strawberry real fruit slushe.  We hung out in our car, listened to music and enjoyed our drinks.  

Getting into this place is a little odd because it is not actually on Boulder Highway, but set back with a medium in front of it.  I was going southbond on Boulder Highway, had to do what I thought would be a  u-turn, but ended up having to make a left, then left to get into the weird parallel street to Boulder Highway."}
{"text":"Only because we lack a Sonic's in Hawaii, I venture to this place so willingly.  Unfortunately, the customer service here is a hit or miss.  I'm not sure if I like the delivery to car, considering I have had most of my drink spilt on me (and inside the car) in the process.  During that same trip though, they somehow gave me a Limeade (that I definitely did not order), so that made me a little less bothered.   
Make sure to go during \"Happy Hour\" to take advantage of the special drink prices.  The drinks pretty much end up all tasting the same to me, super sugary, tangy, not to mention make me have a huge rush after consumption.  
The hot dogs are meh, nothing special... Yet, somehow savory good when nothing else is open and moderately priced in the wee hours of the morning."}
{"text":"Sonic does not sell banana splits anymore!!!!!
I could not believe this!!! Wonder who the eienstein is that thought of this!!! Will never go there again!! Its un-American!!
But instead, they have those high price little hot dogs that are over priced!!!!"}
{"text":"i have a weakness: slushies and icees. sonic always satisfies that craving. happy hour is between 2-4pm and drinks are 1/2 off:)  their burgers and tater tots are pretty good and they offer a full menu all day, which comes in handy when i need a cheeseburger at 8 am after work!"}
{"text":"i guess they close outside service  early. .. but my hubby and i planned a quick bike ride and a shake and James came to assist  us even though we missed  the closing  by a few... great shakes and great  service  thanks James"}
{"text":"Went to the new Sonic in Parma on opening night. The staff was fast and friendly. They performed very well considering it was their opening night and the place was slammed with people. We had to wait in a line of cars for about 20 minutes before we even got a stall. As expected on an opening night though.

We got the biggest and best cheesburgers and sides money could buy there being Sonic virgins. All in all I'd say they came in a very strong second place in that area along Snow Rd. which offers 5 different cheesburger options. First = Burger King \"Triple Whopper\", Second = Sonic \"Super SonicBurger\", Third = Wendy's \"Triple Cheeseburger\", Fourth = Eatin Park \"Double Cheeseburger\", Fifth = McDonalds \"Big Mac\".

Not the best value for the money in the end and not the worst like Eatin Park or Mcdonalds though. The burgers were satisfying and the meat taste like a hamburger should. Sides were pretty average... tater tots with cheese and onion rings with ketchup. The drinks were tasty they have HUGE variety of slushies which we loved. Certain that above all else is Sonic's claim to fame.

Ultimately you just end up paying a few dollars more than usual for the insurance required to cover the \"car hops\" (waiters/waitresses on skates) should they take a spill and go on workers comp for a few weeks. You get an experience that is perhaps a little more interesting than the Burger King drive thru window but a burger that's not quite as good. So if that's your thing then Sonic is a good bet on Snow Rd. Sure wish we had a 5 Guys a little closer to my house! =P"}
{"text":"I've given this Sonic 3-4 tries. I like this location because it's super conveniently close and there's not another south of here for miles. 

Every time if go to this location, there seems to consistently be an issue with my order. The location is great. The staff seems wonderful, but all that is pointless when you're order is incorrect. Especially when it's the food, that leaves you're last impression on the business. Not a fan!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever had at a sonic. They got the order completely wrong. Waited 25 mins just for a combo of the wings... which they got wrong. Very disappointed. Plan to be here for a good 30 minutes."}
{"text":"last few times we attempted to go there.. we just waited in line forever.. we will not be back.. oh.. plus the food stinks too.. not a fan..  too bad.. coulda been good"}
{"text":"Sonic, where would I be without your tasty goodness?  Eating at some other fast food joint that has no Happy Hour.  Daily at your local Sonic from 2 - 5 PM...Happy Hour that has 1/2 off of your favorite drinks and slushes!

This one is pretty cool since it's in the local Walmart.  Weird, but cool.  I really think it's the only Walmart in all of Las Vegas (possibly even all of Nevada) that has a friggin' Sonic inside it's walls.  Yeah, screw you McDonald's..take your Golden Arches elsewhere!  Sonic is coming with the big guns, and will PUMP...YOU...UP!  

This Sonic is different in the fact that it has no Drive-In but the good old eats are all the same.  You got your burgers and hot dogs, fries and onion rings.  All the shakes and slushes are still there too.  But at this Sonic you can grocery shop and stop!  As long as you love to grocery shop at Walmart.  I can't stand Walmart.  Especially on a Sunday.

Sonic is where I like to go for a cheap hot dog and a drink.  The only other place I like going to is Costco...cheap on the cheap!  But at Sonic I can get me my 'cheat meal' of a foot long Chicago Dog or Coney with Chili & Cheese (plus mustard and extra onions), a side of tater tots, and a Route 44 Low-Cal Cherry Limeade or Low-Cal Cherry Diet Dr. Pepper.  OH YUM YUM.  All for less than $6!  Sure beats a combo # anything at just about any other fast food place.  Yeah yeah, I know you Chicagoans will groan that the Chicago Dog at Sonic ain't close to authentic, but who cares!  For the price and our current economy I'm sold!  I haven't been to a place here in Las Vegas yet besides Sonic that will sell me a foot long Chicago Dog!  Happy eats = Happy man-child.  

The shakes here beat out a lot of other places too.  I mean come on, Sonic uses real ice cream soft serve for their shakes and the price is hard to beat.  I love a Cookies & Cream or Strawberry shake on a hot Las Vegas summer night.  Plus, don't forget with every order you get free Sonic Mints!  A nice touch to make your Sonic experience feel a bit Old School.  Natch!

Service here is fairly quick, and at least in my experience always friendly and efficient.  Yeah, don't make this guy wait long for his food.  Me hungry!"}
{"text":"Who loves cheap cheap cheap?  I love cheap cheap cheap!  When I hit the mood for a fast food fix during the late afternoon slump, decisions abound!  The Arches...The King...The KFC...who will I go to for my greasy lil' treat?  Most times I end up at Sonic!

I like hitting Sonic during their awesome 'Happy Hour' from 2-4 PM for 1/2 off drinks!  And boy do those drinks hit the sweet spot.  I love my Route 44 (gigantor size for you Sonic virgins) in some of my go to flavors:

-Diet. Dr. Pepper or Diet Coke with Low-Cal Diet Cherry
-Low-Cal Diet Cherry Limeade
-Sweet Tea
-Ocean Water (hint of coconut)
-Blue Coconut Slush (mix with tequila and rum anyone??)

And always, ALWAYS with extra ice!  It's your ultimate drink stop!  Besides the drinks the menu has nice choices for snackin'.  I can order off the 'Everyday Value Menu', where I'll get a Jr. Deluxe Burger or a Chicken Strip Sandwich, and a small order of Tots.  Winnah, winnah, cheap A$$ dinnah!  

If I've been really good with my diet during the week, I'll give in a little and gets me a hot dog!  I really like the Footlong Quarter Pound Coney, with extra onions and add mustard please!  God, I am such a glutton.  I recently had Sonic's take on The Chicago Dog and it was pretty good too.  And...I'm back to the treadmill.

Nope...the food ain't gourmet...and yep...it's a chain...but this place stays so busy!  Gotta love the drive-in aspect, the ordering boards right next to your parking space, and the window service.  Very old school and fun for the kids to see.  Service is always fast and friendly so it keeps me coming back.  

Hmmm.....wonder where I'll be going for a snack after work today???"}
{"text":"I had a previous bad experience with crappy service at this location but I'm a forgiving person so I thought I'd give them a second chance. I don't think these people could be any slower if they worked at it! This was ridiculous! I ordered two drinks. You read that right-2 drinks! Most of the locations in town would send someone to the drive thru lane to deliver the simple orders like that, but apparently not this one. Of course the guy behind me got his shake delivered. I won't EVER come back to this location. I gave up after sitting in line for 15 minutes AFTER I placed my order."}
{"text":"I love Sonic, but the food at this location isn't quite as good as others.  This location is not in the best area of town for you out-of-towners.  We did get fast service though."}
{"text":"Sonic food at it's finest.   We had dinner at midnight and everything was made fresh.  I couldn't ask for anything more.  The chili cheese coneys were delicious."}
{"text":"I see why this one only gets 2 stars by others. I give 1 star because they couldn't even get a simple request of no cheese on a burger. Not a big deal for most but being lactose intolerant it is a big deal. So way to go Sonic on Baseline Phoenix."}
{"text":"The watermelon slushy I had was good. The drinks are half price from 2-4pm so it was a good deal. The chili cheese dogs were sub par. I'd expect those to come from 7-11. Ball park type hot dog not natural casings. Cheese tasted like it was from a 7-11 cheese fountain for nachos. Chili was nothing special. If I ever go back it won't be to order any type of hot dog."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a bout five years off and on. Fast food is fast food. Can't actually believe I'm doing a yelp review on it.  But I am completely shocked and appalled about the service.  
It has  continually gotten worse and the staff they hire seem to all have bad attitudes and are extremely rude!   It is not my fault it is happy hour and you are understaffed.  It's not my fault your microphones don't work worth a crap and you can't hear me.  Don't  get snotty and rude with me because you can't hear.  Brian was the one who went off on my son and I today because he couldn't hear.  I was using a token that was given to me from last poor service trip two weeks ago. I mentioned I was using it for the free drink and asked for a dirty doctor pepper and he said I couldn't use it for that. I asked why and he said because I would have to pay extra for the coconut flavor and I said I would pay the 25 cents extra. Maybe I'm offended that he would even mention it to me. I'm ordering 40 bucks worth of food too and 25 cents doesn't mean crap. I was jut trying to use my chip before I lost it or something.  Anyway. It became a real fiasco today.  And he lost his cool over the order.  I think I'll start going to sonic on greenfield and brown. Much better.  Apparently the management needs help here. I give them two stars for effort and good ice chips. :)"}
{"text":"Last few times here I've seen the employees underwear hanging out male and female. Went through the drive through and the attendant told another employee to finish ringing us up because she had to go \"pee\". This was said in front of me. Slow service. Bad management. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My chicken sandwich was cold and there was barely any chicken, it was mostly all bread. You can also tell it was sitting out for awhile, the meat was hard to bite into. I definitely won't be coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"First time in FOREVER I've had good service here!! Justin was absolutely wonderful and helped me find a way to go around them taking the banana split off the menu!! He saved my night!! Thank you Justin! Give him a raise!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 10:51 and the drive through attendant stated that their kitchen was closed and they couldn't serve food. The location closes at 11PM"}
{"text":"Sonic is great and this one is the same as the rest. Sometimes it's busy, sometimes it's not. Sometimes an idiot takes your order, sometimes not. The food is always good though"}
{"text":"The absolute worst Sonic ever. Now I know you don't go to Sonic for fast service, not a single one I've been to will have your food ready in under five minutes, but this one is slower than all with the worst service ever. The staff consists of all teenagers looking like they were hired to walk and talk. We avoid this location as much as possible, but unfortunately it's the closest to us."}
{"text":"I wish this wasn't the closest sonic to my house, because I get a craving for cranberry limeades on a regular basis...and unfortunately, a trip to this location is NEVER under 15 minutes. It doesn't matter if you use the drive thru or the drive in option...the wait is always horrendously long. I've even tried going in a different times of the day, hoping for a change, but it is to no avail.

On a good note, they do make the limeades well...must be what's taking so long! :)"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this Sonic I am impressed. The food is made to order and the service is excellent. I will specifically go out of my way to patronize this Sonic."}
{"text":"The service at this Sonic is very inconsistent. On two separate occasions, one of them being today, I received rock hard tator tots. When I placed my order it was given to me in under 2 minutes, which is a sure sign of pre made food. And sure enough, I get home to find the tator tots are rock hard.   I have never had this type of service from any other Sonic in Las Vegas or Henderson. It is unfortunate because, like I said, this is the only location that has a poor quality of food. I will be calling the manager and leaving a review on their website, as well. 

So....I called the manager about the rock hard tator tots. He said he would send me coupons in the mail to make up for it. Never happened. I went back to this location to see if their service had improved. It has not. I was given pre made, rock hard, nasty tator tots again. This time I sent them back. I will never go back again."}
{"text":"The service here is pretty slow but I'm under the impression that sonic makes all of their food to order so it's okay by me! 

Their variety in drinks, happy hour fr 2 to 5, and their options of finger foods really does it for me

I love how a cherry coke means adding cherry syrup to coke. So much better than bottled cherry coke. 

I'm not a fan of their mozzarella sauce.

But their fry sauce is awesome."}
{"text":"I usually love SONIC && their slushes but this time we waited 22 minutes in the drive through to purchase 2 slushes one large one xl. I could barely understand what the person was saying thru the intercom and upon receiving my coke slush was truly disappointed as it didn't taste anything like Coca Cola !! But refused to wait another 20 minutes to be made another one !! Don't know if I'll be back !"}
{"text":"Terrible.

I'm sure it's probably just this location, but almost everything was wrong.

We ordered the chicken strip meal with a sweet tea, a small frozen blue raspberry slushee and a small classic limeade slushee. As we pulled up to the window, the girl repeated back our order (which was right) but it was as if she completely didn't comprehend any of it. She got my bf's sweet tea right, but initially gave us another small sweet tea and I guess a regular limeade drink? We told her that we received another sweet tea, instead of our blue raspberry slushee. She came back and gave us another drink, that wasn't even blue, and you guessed it...it wasn't even right. She also didn't even look at us or say anything; just closed the window and walked away. She obviously didn't even care - so there was no point in trying again.

*Mind you, I was going off of the menu I saw online.
I completely understand if that particular location didn't serve the new items there, but we weren't told otherwise.

We get back to our hotel and find random stuff in the chicken strip box. It looks as if they just threw in whatever they could reach and thought it was good enough.

I'd give this Sonic location a 0 if I could."}
{"text":"The food here is terrible and overpriced! They wouldn't even give us refills on soda! I've never heard of such a thing. We paid 2.19 for a large Diet Coke that was half ice, with no refills. We had 2 drinks, a small popcorn chicken, 3 chicken tenders, onion rings and jalapeño poppers and it was almost $18.00!!!!
Avoid this chain at all costs!!"}
{"text":"I always liked Sonic's for some good ole food. This location is pretty convenient for this particular area and not too busy for it being located on Sahara one of the busiest streets around here. The staff are good and friendly, every now and then an order might not be so accurately delivered. But for the most part they're not too bad."}
{"text":"Sonic has great food and tons of drink and dessert options. This location is a little underwhelming in its presentation however. It does not have many pull up stalls anymore after they removed half of them, some of the order stations don't work and it could be cleaner. The staff is great and the food is good, so if your just wanting good sonic food and don't care about the other stuff, this location will do just fine."}
{"text":"The usual Sonic drive thru. Love the happy hour half price slushi drinks. The foot long coney hotdog was really good and lots of chilli. Love the onion rings. 
The service was awful. It took got ever to take our order. They need to get more workers to help the few that were going crazy."}
{"text":"Good experience. Nice staff even though our visit was really late. I thought it was weird the drive thru doesn't have a window but I guess that's the whole place. Hot fudge sundae looked and tasted good. This chain place lives up to its reputation. Fast, tasty, and clean."}
{"text":"Sonic is supposed to be a modern version of the classic drive-in diners from the 50s, complete with carhops that bring out your food on roller skates. Well, sometimes. I stopped in for a milkshake last night and was disappointed to see the carhop walking.  I have been there other times and the carhops have been on skates... 

The shake itself was good, Sonic does deserts well and the fact that they are open 24 hours is a big plus. The food itself is nothing special in my opinion, although if you are craving tater tots and are in a rush this is the place to get them"}
{"text":"First of all, I usually do not review a FF restuarant unless the service great, service was poor, or I had exceptional experience. 

This was actually the very first Sonic I've been to. It was over 10 years ago and been to others since.  Always ordered through drive thru or walk up.  Today was the first time using the drive in.  I actually thought that this was pretty cool.  Just kick back, check out the menu, then order.  I didn't a spot for cash so I ended up using my debit.  In the years, I've tried almost everything on the menu and nothing really sets them apart.  But today, I had the Flatmelt Steak and Bacon.  This was surprising good.  Juicy pieces of steak mixed with bacon in a flatbread.  You can't go wrong.  Sonic didn't at least.  Had the tater tots. Always have to get the tater tots when I come here.  

If you chose the drive in to eat or order, your food is served to you via a roller blading waitress.  Open 24hours, but at night they place can get a bit dicey.  

If I'm in the area, hungry, and looking for a quick bit....Sonic on Rancho is the place."}
{"text":"This Sonic has never gotten my order right. Always the wrong burger or messed up toppings. I like Sonic, and this one is close to work for me, but I avoid going there now."}
{"text":"I come to this Sonic WAY more than I want to admit. Rarely is it for food, it's the slushies, shakes and blasts that keep me coming back. 

Currently Sonics has two promotions I like to take advantage of: drinks and slushies are half off from 2 pm to 5pm, and shakes are half off after 8 pm.

When I do get food here, I stick with the basics: Sonic burger and tots. To me, these burgers are a couple steps above what you'd get at McDonalds, but not quite as good as one from In&Out/Fatburger/5 Guys.  

There is another Sonic nearby (on Boulder Highway) that is just as close to home as this one, however the friendly service at this location is what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Recently the service is terrible, they get my order wrong, and I waited at least 30 minutes in the drive thru. A couple of months ago, they had different employees and their customer service was a lot better."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were craving ice cream and decided to drive over to Sonic.  As we pulled into the drive thru it took a few minutes for anyone to welcome us and ask for our order on the intercom.  When my fiancé asked a clarification question,  the young man on the other end responded with a short, rude remark.  We moved on and began placing our order then found out they were out of cookie dough,  understandable,  so we asked if they were out of anything else only to receive another sarcastic remark in return.  When we finished placing our order we pulled up,  paid and we're told our order would be right out. We were the only car in the drive thru, and there were very few,  if any,  other customers.  Almost ten minutes later a young lady finally comes to the window,  apologizes for the wait,  thank you for that, and gives us our long awaited order.  I just think it cod have been handled better."}
{"text":"Foods of Sonic Standards and the employees seem friendly. I only wish the employee with the motorcycle wouldn't park it in the seated area and also they would be more prompt to empty trash containers. These two things were annoying the three times I've eaten here."}
{"text":"The management was really poor here!!

They had my order completely wrong.

Then she got on the intercom screaming and shout"}
{"text":"I don't normally go to a Sonic, but once in awhile I do just for their Blasts. I just don't find that their burgers or chicken sandwiches to be that good for what you have to pay for them. I can get something way better (quality and quantity) from another place like In-N-Out for cheaper. 

I've been to this location several times since I moved back and have had a pretty good experience. I'd done the drive-thru and Drive-In and both seem to be about the same as far as speed when it comes to getting your food. Drive-thru can get really busy though and at times it takes forever to get your order. However, the ladies working here are always very friendly and smile when they bring out your food. 

My go-to order is usually a small Turtle Pecan blast with extra Pecans. Most locations just add a couple more pecan pieces, but this location actually gives you \"extra\" when you ask for it. The last time I ordered this though, their nuts were super stale and I had to pick out most of them as it just ruined the flavor of my blast..oh well..

Oh yeah, I can't forget how I absolutely LOVE their ice here. I'll go out of my way to go to a Sonic just for their ice."}
{"text":"This is the third time in a row I've had a horrible experience in the drive-through late night it's 330 in the morning but I shouldn't get food that is so awful you literally want to throw it out your window my tater tot's or cold like they were in the refrigerator my hamburger was as hard as a rock also cold I don't get it how do they not know the kind of food there serving it taste like garbage I love the sonic and I've been coming here 15 years but I don't think I can do it ever again :)"}
{"text":"The ice cream machine had JUST broken down when we got there for shakes. Not to mention other times I've been here and they have gotten my order wrong after waiting 20 minutes for it. I'm so fed up with this place."}
{"text":"I love the ice and an ocean water!

Its your typical sonic. Good food and drinks. The people who work there are polite and hurry to get you your stuff. If I am thirsty, I like to stop here and get a diet ocean water. Hubby likes to get coke with cherries. You can also buy their ice if you are having a party. Not much else to report here. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today. Ordered three number ones all to be made differently. They only got two right. Complete left off my lettuce and tomatoes, and it was drowning in catsup. The Fry's were cold and the tits were so hard they hurt my teeth. It's making me feel like they don't even care anymore. I tell you they lost me as a customer today. I will gladly go out of my way to another location. Disappointed."}
{"text":"This will always be my fav Sonic ! I go to the ones out here and Idk it doesnt feel the same ! But i miss it ! Hopefully Ill get to visit soon ! Great for those late night cravers !"}
{"text":"Love the burgers and shakes! Yummy! The sonic burger and the onion rings are the best! Always great service and really never have to wait very long  and they always have specials! Don't know why but soda pop in sonic's ice is sooooo goood ! And I love their chocolate shakes"}
{"text":"This is, by far, the slowest and most incompetently staffed Sonic I have visited. On my last three trips, I waited 15+ minutes for a small, simple order. I also noticed the car hops routinely take food to the wrong cars, then going back inside (for a long time) to figure it out.  When I finally received the orders, they were incredibly stingy with the quantity of the side orders and the quality was not up to standards of other Sonics.  I will avoid this location from now on."}
{"text":"You guys have installed the new car side displays but I have complained many times it is very hard to hear them speaking to you to place the order."}
{"text":"Always super fast service when I come. I cant say much about the food because I only stop by for the drinks. If you don't already know, happy hour is everyday from 2pm-4pm."}
{"text":"Been going to this Sonic for 6 years with no mess ups on my order, I also just complimented the sweet girl that works here the other day on her customer service.  
Then heeeere comes Xzavier with his \"I don't care\" personality. Had to repeat my order a couple times and he didn't even get it right, handed us our food and drinks and before we can ask for salsa he just shut the door on us. Had to wait at the window for a good 3 minutes before he finally noticed us. Meh. Disappointing. One star for you Xzavier, one star for you. The additional stars is for the many times I've came here and the customer service was on point."}
{"text":"Worst sonic ever!!! Just got my sonic blast with literally nothing in it! What am I paying for??"}
{"text":"I go to sonic because I love their onion rings. I order a large and I get the equivalent of a small. Livid pissed right now."}
{"text":"What's a good way to make up for a night of getting all dressed up and just standing around? 

I answer that question with, Sonic. Open late and providing decent food and beverage is always a good look. Snack sized Popcorn Chicken and a Cherry Limeade Slush, was just the tits. Couldn't ask for a better way to wrap up the evening. Service was a little slow for my tastes, one star dockage, but all and all, good filling stuff.

Now I'm just hoping to fall asleep soon."}
{"text":"Great food , and even better customer service. Everything seemed to be cooked perfect and fresh. Super outing for our grandchildren. Special shout out to the Manager, for going the extra mile . A bit of kindness goes a long way."}
{"text":"I actually had a stellar experience at this sonic. Wait was 1-2 minutes and all the food was hot and correct. Well done !"}
{"text":"Yo, I just went here about 5 minutes ago and ordered a Footlong Coney, New York Dog, a Medium Snickers Blast, and some Tater Tots...

& I never got my Tater Tots.

I really miss my tater tots, they were what I was really looking forward to eating. The succulent salty little fellows. Smh, I kinda upset but I'm not mad. I understand mistakes happen. But now my meal tonight will feel forever incomplete because I'm too lazy to drive back there and I don't wanna be one of those customers that make an employees day bad.

Sonics, you let me down today. Now I have to play Fortnite and constantly think about my tots.

RIP Tots, I miss you."}
{"text":"I got their cheeseburger with bacon and chili cheese tator tots. Something was realllly off with my burger. It just kept giving me a weird taste in my mouth and to this day I still haven't been able to figure out what it was. My boyfriend got the toaster though and he loved it and was absolutely raving about it. The tator tots were ok but nothing special. Overall decent experience but wouldn't come back here. We stopped in only because there are very few sonic's around where I live in California. Just not really a fan."}
{"text":"All my food was cold. Got a number 7 with tots and a coney. Ate it in the car and it all tasted like yesterday's left overs. Just plain Horrible."}
{"text":"Customer service and quality has decreased dramatically over the last few months. Food has obviously been sitting around. One time I got a chicken strip sandwich and the chicken was soft/rubbery it wouldn't even break and was gray. Other times the food is cold or made wrong. 
What made me want to write a review was today's special performance of asking if there was condiments in the bag and then witnessing my bag being opened, the girl open mouthed coughing over it, and then putting packets in there. It wasn't on purpose but she couldn't have turned around or said sorry. Also she didn't wash her hands after she did this which made me not want to use the packets of sauce anymore. 
There's one girl that works the drive thru window every now and then that literally has no personality whatsoever. I'll try to get her name and update later."}
{"text":"We have been to this location several times and we run into the same issues each time. When you ask for things like ketchup packets, salt packets, and extra napkins you shouldn't have to check your bag before you drive away to see if the employees were doing their jobs. This location has great potential, but its chances of being a place you can count on to get the order right is diminishing. We have actually made a game out if it. We have been here 8 times in 2 months and they have yet to get our order correct."}
{"text":"If you have 3 hours to wait for your food, enjoy pushing the red button over and over to place your order more than once, if you enjoy cold food and rude service this is the place to be!!  Although they are close by, we never stop in as they can't seem to get their act together and learn how run a restaurant. Even for being fast food this place SUCKS!!!  BEWARE!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. Food tastes bad and slushies taste like tap water. If you want sonic drive a couple extra miles to a different one because this is not sonic."}
{"text":"Inside Walmart. It seems to take forever to get your food. The coney wasn't very good this time. The burger my husband ate was good. Tots were good.  Your typical sonic, just slower."}
{"text":"Half price shakes after 8!!!! Need I say more? Always enjoy a great shake or slush after a long day in the heat. Food is clean and always tasty. Staff is always polite and attentive. Actually while I'm thinking about it I'm going out right now for a fresh fruit strawberry slush. See u there!"}
{"text":"Slowest sonic ever! Been here four times because the convenient location and every time I've waited in the drive thru for about ten mins. Twice they messed up my small order as well. I'm very disappointed with this location."}
{"text":"I stopped by here with my wife on Tuesday night to try their half price shakes after 8 PM.  She is a big fan of ice cream, and with this being so close to our house we had to give it a try.  We both ended up ordering a mini milkshake which was more than enough.  She had the peanut butter and I tried Strawberry.  The milkshakes were just OK, nothing desirable. The calorie count was awful, and I wish they didn't have to post this on their menu! 

I feel like this place is something that kids would love to go to.  You can sit in the car and order and have someone skate your food out to you.  Kids probably won't care that its not the best milkshake (its a milkshake and that is all that matters).  Not in any rush to return here."}
{"text":"Worst Sonic in the history of EVERS!  Their drive thru took 23 minutes to just get my order. I'm never coming back to this slow location"}
{"text":"This place is terrible! I drove in late tonite 10:30 ish the guy didn't want to take my order ok I think ge must be busy no biggy but i asked him for tge blast that the commecial advertises and i said with peanut butter cups and peices... he kind of rushed me an I know what I want i seen it in the commercials for sonic and I believe mist oeoppe go there because of these advertisements but tge own employee's never seen them? He had no clue at all! I said the small chicken hot dogs so i asked for the one with beacon and bar b que sauce... tge gut comes out hands me a cup and and a bag tells me my order. Then I adk about the happy hour after 8:00? Blasts and cream shakes/slush are not even in the menu I was upset cause tgese people have no clue and are not at all friendly... I leterally feel like crap cause when i get home each of the chicken dogs are drenched in bar b que sauce!!! Dripping wet with spicey bar b que sauce! I fidn't even eat them the blast was the wrong one!!! Some coockie dough one that taste like hell!!!  I feel like suing Sonic for my $7.75 back! My gf told me to stay away from all Henderson fast food spots very poor service!"}
{"text":"I think the bad reviews may be based on who was working that day. This is the first Sonic I've been to since living in Nevada and I thought it was not bad for a fast food joint. Food came out relatively quick (there were a lot of people there), my order was correct and it was a big order ($40), and the lady that brought it out was very polite and even came back to check on the food. Didn't get 5 stars because the custard was a little overpriced, but it was quite delicious."}
{"text":"Used to love sonic, but the ones out here in Vegas SUCK! 
Only redeeming quality are the bags of ice I can take home and make myself. 
All of the sonics I've been to seem to be filled with drugged out drunks, the sodas and ice cream machines could spare to be cleaned thoroughly, and the food is not good! Go to Wendy's instead."}
{"text":"Got the crispy chicken box (chicken strips, fries, onion rings, toast) it had ONE onion ring, not sure how that happens but it's ridiculous. Every time we go to sonic after 8pm for half price shakes we have to mix them ourselves. They Never include sauces that should be included with meals."}
{"text":"Stay far far away from Sonic in Mayfield Hts! I had an awful experience at this Sonic. Something is very wrong with way this is run check the reviews! To start with I waited at least 30 mins in drive thru. I had to repeat order several times. Several people left line due to wait. I finally get to the window and wait at least another 5 mins. I repeated my order again bc they had it wrong when got to window. Of course I get my order and it is wrong so now I have to go in. There is no one at the counter and all there is a bell. I wait another 5 mins and in the mean time I see a worker eating fries out of the fryer!!! What the heck! Get my order corrected finally with no apology! And no receipt. I should have gotten out if line like most everyone else. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"LOVE SONIC! But not a fan of this one. Unfortunately it's the closest to my job. They almost every time I go, take sooo long to bring your order. Once i waited in the drive thru 18 minutes for a shake! Also hate how they don't mix the slushy drinks well. My opinion is they need to be faster and more about customer service."}
{"text":"If you say you make the chocolate jalapeño shake and I get excited and request the biggest size I can get, I expect gold in a cup. Not a big cup with plenty of chocolate shake and at the bottom (I searched!) A single slice of jalapeño.... come on seriously? Lazy is what I got"}
{"text":"I really like their new screens where you can see your order to make sure it's all there and correct. I like all the food. It's nice that you can stay in your car without going through the drive through."}
{"text":"My favorite one stop spot. Open twenty-four hours and a mile away from the strip. Late nite shake and iceberg blends. Tots and jalapeño poppers are a must. New York dog and boneless Chicken are just a few pointers if you have no ideas"}
{"text":"Pros:
The close proximity to my apartment (can walk on a nice day).
Have never been served by a rude employee.
Don't think that I've received a messed up order yet.
Happy hour is worth it for the (usually) on point limeades.
Cons:
Usually takes long for the order to come out, even when it seems like I'm the only car there.
The food is too expensive for how it tastes and how small it is.

Overall, gets 5 stars because of the location and happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"The cherry limeades are amazing, the food is good,and the service is just ok.  There is almost always a long line whenever I swing by this Sonic.  The people who take the orders are usually not the friendliest and sometimes I have to repeat my order over and over and over, but eventually it gets ordered correctly.  It isn't a 5 star place, but the cherry limeades will keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Tried them for the very first time yesterday afternoon.

Aside from not knowing that you paid the young kid standing outside w/your treats, I think I did okay. I ordered a single cheeseburger with all the fixin's and a small soda. Burger were pretty tasty! They could have gone a little lighter w/the mayo, but overall - not too shabby!

I've heard rave reviews on their tots as well - can't wait to try these puppies some other day. Oh, and all of their slushies and shakes."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't bother with a review but I sometimes see it as balancing the good with the bad. We have become a society that wants it now!!! And if we don't get it now!!! We whine like babies.....
 I come to Sonic at least every two weeks and have never received as bad as some of my fellow yelpers the service they have received here.

I don't know anyone that works here and I drive 3 different vehicles and it's not like anyone recognizes me when I pull up so their is no favoritism here, I'm polite when I order and it's amazing how I get politeness in return...

Ok I'm done ranting, I ordered a Pineapple malt and it was cold creamy and delicious!

I will be coming back because I support the businesses in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food was decent for fast food. The burgers were overcooked, but all fast food joints do that. No pink! The tater tots were saltier than I prefer, but edible. The service was quick and friendly. I have had lesser food and service quality before, but the new management sign made it worth a new try. I'll probably return at some time."}
{"text":"I don't know what the problem is with this particular Sonic, but it is the worst I have ever encountered.  The service here is always super slow.  One night we waited almost 30 minutes.  I vowed not to go back, but the other night I really wanted a milkshake and this was the closest place.  It was supposed to be half price after 8, but I was charged more.  I even asked because I thought it sounded high, and they assured me it was half price.  Not worth my time to deal with them to get the money back.  I just won't go back ever again."}
{"text":"There are things I like about Sonic.  The 24 hour drive through, Cheddar Peppers, and amazing shakes come to mind.  But then there are the things that bother me.  Like going twice to try the pretzle dog with cheese and bacon and being disappointed twice when I was told they were sold out.  Now I am not a restaurant owner or manager but it seems to me that when a special item that looks so insanely good is advertised so heavily you should order large quantities so as not to run out.  Is it just me?  One of these days, before they are discontinued, I will try one of these dogs.  One of these days I will find a Sonic with a full stock of specialty and regular menu items.  In the mean time, Cheddar Peppers and a Chicago dog will have to do."}
{"text":"For those that haven't been to Sonic and aren't completely averse to fast food, what are you waiting for?  This chain has some of the tastiest, most artery-cloggingly good stuff.  

They immediately get 2 stars just for having tater tots.  Everyone knows tots are potatoes in their finest form, it's just a scientific fact that cannot be questioned.  The official list is provided below:

1.  Tater Tots
2.  Hash Browns
3.  Au Gratin
4.  Twice-baked (because 2 is better than 1).
5.  Baked

They get another 2 stars for having one of the tastiest beverage concoctions known to man, the cherry limeade.  Again, if you haven't tried it, I kinda feel bad for you.  

However, I can't give them the full 5 stars.  While their peripherals are damn good, their actual main staples are kinda meh.  Also, at this particular location, there always seems to be a long, slow-moving drive-thru line.  They're probably just understaffed, but it does get annoying."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place too! We went last week and it took them 20 minutes to figure out what we were trying to order. I understand the place is new, but it was a bit ridiculous. The owner came out and aplogized and eventually we got our food. We decided yesterday to give it one more chance. When our order arrived my boyfriend bit into his spicy chicken sandwich and it was completely raw! We called into the restaurant from the drive up order stand and a car hop was sent out to see what the issue was. We were so put off by the raw chicken that we just wanted a refund instead of a new sandwhich. A few minutes later he came back and said his manager was busy. Not sure what's more important than possible food pisoning, but we waited for 15 minutes before he came back and stated they were having a computer glitch and if the order was not refunded to his card within a week to call the store. I guess a cash refund was not a thought when someone is sitting there for 15 minutes. They did refund the entire order which was nice, but we are definitely never going back!"}
{"text":"1st thing...we were waiting 22 minutes in drive thru. We finally get up to the order station block and it silent...until I  said hello! Employee.. said you ready??? I said can I get a minute... silence again.... waited for 2 minutes without anyone noticing and we finally drove up to the window and saw this employee with a green shirt on laughing with the girl in the purple shirt . Finally she walked over to the window and said can I help you? Listen owner...these kids are running your business in the ground and total laziness on communication. Never will  waste my hard earned money at your unsupervised play house. Very discussed and disappointed. I will talk of this horrible experience to all family and friends or even my 3 ft rule. If you're standing by me I will tell anyone. SAD!!! Oh fun fact... there was a Chandler police SUV in the same line."}
{"text":"This was the after work spot for happy hour 'Ocean Water' and cream pie shakes. Pair it with some burgers and chili cheese dogs and a big ass banana split. I miss Sonic's.
The epitome of lazy American eating. Yum."}
{"text":"Pros: My best friend was here for a visit from VA, where they don't have this fast food restaurant. She has actual cravings for their drinks and jalapeño poppers. She loved them. I got a diet Route 44 strawberry limeade. Very refreshing. Fast service. 

Cons: Greasy fast food. I prefer McDonald's fries."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by on the way home. The Mrs. likes me to get her a supersonic breakfast burrito every wednesday after work."}
{"text":"Poor experience. Ordered boneless chicken wings. Took 21 minutes for them to bring them out. Over charged me for the wings ($8.49 on sign, $9.29 on receipt). Gave me a stack of napkins that were covers in the wing sauce, and gave me no plastic fork, so are messy boneless wing with fingers. Overpriced, bad service, mediocre food. Stay away."}
{"text":"I don't even know why I bother trying this one over and over. Without fail, every time I come here they take FOREVER! It's seriously the longest wait in a drive thru I have ever had, even if there are only a few cars. Next time I'm going to drive a few miles out of the way and still get my drink faster than it would have been to sit in this line. Plus they messed up my drink this past time. Worst sonic I have ever been to"}
{"text":"I really hope the managers are able to see this, because I just had the most pleasant experience at Sonic ever! Nik took care of me, and he was polite, engaging, and seemed genuinely happy to help me. (He even laughed at my jokes, bless his heart.) Nik, you were awesome! My order was quick, perfectly right, and he even offered service after the drop off. I hope I get Nik every time I come back!"}
{"text":"I can't say the carhops are the brightest tools in the shed, but the food is decent & the cherry limeades are always cool & refreshing."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, fast service & polite car hops, but the music was so loud I couldn't hear the guy on the speaker - I had to ask him to turn it down. You know you're getting old when you think the music is too loud."}
{"text":"It is close to my home and I go there often, the food and slushies are good, unfortunately the card readers are comprised often, so I now only go when paying in cash and lately they have been lacking.  One day I stopped in for a sundae and they usually never remember to give us spoons, so I asked like normal and they said they had none but offered a fork, lol, the next day I ordered a float and a slush but they were out of slushies for the day, at 6pm really??? I've been going to the sonic on South Pecos lately so I don't have to worry about the hassle."}
{"text":"I waited in the drive thru line for 10 minutes when they said they will be right with us. They kept taking at least 3 other cars orders in the other lane and never got to our order. Avoid this sonic at all cost!!"}
{"text":"Two of my colleagues and I had a business lunch at Sonic and tour outing was very fun.
I was a novice to the Sonic experience as I took everything in.
The parking lot was clean, we had a nice view of a Arizona State Tree - the Palo Verde and a clear perspective of a colorful storage facility.
We ordered our lunch through the Sonic Remote Audio device and paid remotely on the same apparatus, via credit card.
Our lunch was delivered to the car within minutes, by our cheerful car hop waiter. 
I had a grilled chicken sandwich, tater tots(recommended by my friend) and a lemon/berry drink. Everything tasted great, especially enjoyed the great textures & flavor of the tater tots. The drink was perfect for our scorching Phoenix day.
Sonic, looking forward to a return for another power lunch."}
{"text":"I ordered my food at 8:20 am and sat there waiting for it 30 mins had passed and I was already going to be late for work so I had to just leave the girl who took my order also sounded irritated and like she didn't want to be there I know not everybody wants to be at work at days but that shouldn't project to your customers very disappointed I love sonic and was looking forward to my drink and food"}
{"text":"This is gonna be one of those, \"good news, bad news\" reviews.  It does turn out well but there are twists and turns...
 
I've eaten at Sonic's over the years, good food most of the time, but honestly, what are the expectations at a Sonic at 3am?  They're not often all than high.  

About 3 years ago, driving Über, I found myself at a the Sonic very near Luke Air Force Base, west of Phoenix, around mid-morning.  And, you know, there is something exhilarating, exciting, liberating about realizing that eating a Double Cheeseburger at 10am is a good idea.  It isn't, and it is.  Yes!  To me, this happens like once every 2 years, so I was excited.  And on this day I did it!
 
Service was ok, burger, good.  Good, not great.  Not that hot, a good 10 am burger but now that I have a recent \"hot\" reference, it just wasn't that hot.  

Here's the real problem from that day: the fries were fried in oil THAT WAS OLD.  TOO OLD.  Old enough that it made me sick. Not food poisoning-sick, not \"bad oysters\" sick, but sick.  And quite frankly, I've never gotten over it.  Stuck in my mind.  In fact, I have NEVER been able to drive in again to a Sonic, and say, \"Oh, I'm sure this will be better\".  Hell, I don't know that and I don't want to be made sick again.  Too many other burger options.  Even McDonald's at high-noon is far better because I know the fries will be ok.
 
Here's a part of the story that's really SONIC-unbelievable: after \"recovering\" the next day from my feeling poor, I called the store, asked for the manager, told him what had happened.  He told me, specifically, and I quote, \"...uh, yeah, I 'thought' about replacing the grease that morning but didn't\".  Wait, wait?

Honestly, I thought proper food service - you know, supervised by the County Health they would supervise proper FOOD SERVICE - but it did not work that way!  Create a maintenance schedule.  For a major chain restaurant?  \"you thought you might conduct maintenance....?\"  Sheesh.
 
So, it's been a longtime.  I Would Not Go Back.  And why would I?  Got a burger joint every 5 feet, walking or driving. But, for whatever reason, I found myself at 43rd Avenue and Peoria last week and really wanted a hot double cheese.  No fries, more like mid-afternoon, but I want a double cheese and my nav tells me this is a choice of one.  At least, for that moment.  So I order a double cheese, and for whatever reason, I asked for ketchup and onions only.  Sue me.  What I felt like.

This double cheese came out as hot -- heat-hot -- as any burger I've ever ordered or cooked.  And, but for the fact that the burger came with EVERYTHING ON IT, not just ketchup and onions, it was delicious.  But I called back on the speaker, said, it's great, really great, but I can't get past 4 or 5 toppings I didn't order.  One or two, maybe, but not lettuce, tomato, pickles ...so, they made it again.

Not only did Sonic make the burger again, the nice day-time manager brought the new version out to me with a future lemonade make-good, to be used for another day.  The second burger was not as hot, or as good as the first, but it was still pretty good.

Now, tonite, 3/1/2018, let's talk Berwyn, my carhop. He did great!  In fact, of my 3 most recent visits, he mar simple a credit card transaction.  I saw a screen that said something about the carhop operating the transaction- and if not seen that previous. Good job!

You eat the fries.  I'll eat the double cheese."}
{"text":"Whenever we are in las vegas this sonic is our go to... being from hawaii we don't have sonics so we usually hit this place alot... we only go to this one because it's near our family's place...  great food and good customer service and the prices are better than anything we have in hawaii."}
{"text":"Do not come here! I ordered two breakfast burritos, a supersonic and ultimate burrito. I asked for the Baja cheese sauce that comes in the ultimate burrito on the side and they refused. Wtf? The girl taking the order even said her manager told her they can't do that. That's funny because I don't seem to have any problems with my order at any of the other sonic locations. After going back and forth I finally settled and ordered light cheese in the burrito. We kept seeing cars in the drive through come and go and we still didn't have our food and when we finally did they were sloppy, hard to eat and after all the hassle my burrito had practically no cheese."}
{"text":"I love sonic, long lines included. I had to wait about ten minutes in the drive through but the employee was very polite. They were also very busy. I ordered the very berry slush! Two people were in front of me but they brought mine out so I didn't have to wait! They slush tasted different not bad though. 

They should get more healthier options and I would be there always! I love their slushy! 

I used to get watermelon green apple but recently switched to the very berry ! Yum"}
{"text":"I love sonic but will not return to this location. My roommate and I wanted two slushes and waited in line for 18 minutes to get handed completely melted slushes. The flavors are great ! Peach and sour blue raspberry!"}
{"text":"Love this sonic. First time trying a slush with nerds. Choking hazard but pretty good. I love watermelon green apple. They asked if I want a boost of sour in there. I declined but that's cool. My roommate got the blue raspberry and lemonade with nerds. Yum yum!! They were fast, on point, and very nice. In and out quickly. Thanks !"}
{"text":"I've loved sonic for a long time I've tried multiple locations never had any issues, but Thursday I went to visit the one near my job and ordered the number 1 which I normally do. The server was sweet and service was fast, however the burger was uneatable. When I opened it it smelled like sour baby poop, not inviting at all, but I thought maybe it's just me. I tried to eat it and idk if it actually tasted like this or if the smell was so strong it overwhelmed the actual taste. But I couldn't eat it I threw the whole thing away and I dont do that unless it's bad. This was horrible I had to down my drink to get the taste out of my mouth and chew on a gum all day worried my breath smelled like the horrific baby poop. The fries tasted just fine but the burger.....gross. Will not come  to this one again."}
{"text":"This place used to have good food. Not anymore !!! Just got a cold hotdog and cold frys. My drink was mostly ice. Won't be eating here again"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would! I ordered a chicken sandwich and about half way in, I realized I was eating RAW chicken. Rubbery pink raw chicken. 
They did nothing except ask me what I wanted them to do. That shouldn't have been the question. I didn't even get a sorry. Worse sonic EVER 
Avoid like the plague. Now I'm waiting for food borne illness to set in, thank you sonic."}
{"text":"LLousy service and apparently they do not instruct their employees on the deals . Cardinals did win yesterday!"}
{"text":"Don't go here on a Sunday night. Dry gross burger, and old jalapeño poppers. 

I will continue to only come here for drinks. Ugh, more than once the food here has been less than stellar."}
{"text":"I can't seem to get service in the drive-thru, this is the 3rd time I have tried to go there around the 11:30 in the morning time frame just to get a drink. I like to get their drinks because they are unique choices, they have a Diet Cherry Limeade I can get, but unfortunately the last few times I've tried to get that no one even answers. Its Upsetting to sit at the drive-thru with no other customers, no other cars in front of me for at least five minutes just to end up leaving and going down the street to Arby's get something that I really don't want. I use the drive-thru because I often have my baby in the car in a car-seat, It's a huge hassle to go in just to get a drink, I was very excited when I realize that there was a Sonic near to me I love Sonic it was one of my favorite places until this one."}
{"text":"Horrible place. I've been to different sonic locations and this one is by far the worst. First of all, sonic isn't really great in the first place. This place is absolutely horrible
I've tried it many times and none of them have been great
The burgers here are super greasy, the burritos which I really like in other places, the ones here always have really burnt eggs and are also super weirdly greasy. The fries are always gross, and the ice cream is weirdly gritty?? 
So if you are craving sonic, just go to a different location."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is store 5295, but this is the one closest to Greenfield and Brown.  I go here once a week and order the same thing every time.  Today when I got back to work and opened my cheeseburger there was so much lettuce on it that it looked like a double cheese burger when it was wrapped up.  Then I go to bite into it and it was cold.  The cheese on my burger was not even melted like usual.  My tater tots were also cold when I popped one in my mouth.  Very disappointed, hopefully next Tuesday will be better."}
{"text":"Ok 1) almost half of the machines to pull up and order at are \"out of order\". 2) you can walk into the inside and see employees laying on benches and napping .3) it is EXTREMELY dirty inside (tables, floors chairs etc. 4) we waiting for 15 minutes for two burgers, fries and drinks. 5) Signs specifically say no loitering but there are definitely several kids doing nothing but that. 6) you can see employees in the back eating food then handing out orders to guests. (Yes I get this happens everywhere but you aren't supposed to do that). 

The food wasn't all that bad, but it wasn't nice and warm either. All in all the place has gone downhill."}
{"text":"My son received a hard, rubbery hot dog in his Wacky Pack. It was not edible. We will not return to this establishment"}
{"text":"Tonight marks the worst fast food restaurant experience I have ever encountered.  This is the last time I will ever visit a Sonic. No other fast food chain I have visited has given me a worse experience than the Sonic on Mckellips Dr. First of all, my son's order was screwed up twice. Then my husband went to pick up his drink, and the lid wasn't properly on the cup and it spilled all over him and his food. Lastly, not knowing that pretzel buns are only for hotdogs, I asked for one on my chicken sandwich and they used 2 hotdog buns and didn't even tell me they don't offer sandwich pretzel buns. Plus, they charged me 2 extra dollars for this creation. This isn't the first time I've had issues with this Sonic. Something is ALWAYS screwed up in the order or the location is out of ice cream. Not only that, any time I call to speak with the manager, they don't care. They barely offer an apology. This restaurant is pathetic and I have many choices in the area, so this will be my last visit to Sonic, or any Sonic for that matter.  It seems that Sonic has no intention of bettering their restaurants. What a shame. Beware and stay away!!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and patient. The food is always fresh and served in a timely manner. We had coupons for 5 different items, and all were honored. The sundae had real ice cream, because normally I have an immediate reaction to cheap ice cream. Not with this sundae. I ordered the strawberry sundae and it was yummy to the last spoonful. OMG, and no stomach-ache afterwards. Fast service with hot food. I have come here on 4 other occasions, and the food is consistently good. With the new advertising it is even better. I will return to this location and include picture..."}
{"text":"Food is typical, but service is great. I wish they still had the strawberry molten cake. It was my favorite. I used to get it a least once a week. Now i hardly go."}
{"text":"Especially in the morning, and it doesn't really matter what you get (breakfast or All-day menu), the food is never warm enough. Later in the day, less problems, but holy moly you're in for disappointment in the morning. I thought it was a fluke but for the 3rd time in as many weeks my tots were basically body temp or less and my coney dog was cold. Like, cheese doesn't even consider melting cold. Chili is lumpy cold. And hey, the dog is cold underneath cold chili too! It's not like the food is waiting in the bag on a long ride back to work/school/home. These are cold straight out the bag in the parking lot. Have you ever eaten cold tater tots? They leave a film in your mouth and sadness in your heart. After a cold bite of coney dog, I waited until I could microwave my food so I wouldn't get sick. Two weeks ago it was a cold breakfast toaster. 

On the upside, the people working this location are always really friendly and the vanilla iced coffee is delicious, but that doesn't excuse cold, potentially unsafe food temperatures. Stay away unless you're just getting drinks, shakes, or something that's supposed to be cold."}
{"text":"Great to have a new burger place to choose from in the area. Shakes, burgers, fries, slushies, tater tots. So much to choose from"}
{"text":"It sucks that Sonic's  is so far.

Whenever I'm in Vegas I make more than one visit to this place. I recommend the patty melt, cheese tator tots, and coconut berry slush. SOOO good. be sure you ask for the french fries sauce."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick snack and drink and as always food was hot and fresh and the limeade was very good. Things were very busy this particular afternoon and it took a little extra time but the staff was very apologetic about the situation. This review is to offset some of the bad reviews they will surely get from ungrateful impatient people that have nothing better to do than write bad reviews on Yelp. Bravo staff at Sonic you did a fine job despite your very busy day and don't pay attention to people that use social media to flog you like a dead horse because you were having a hard time keeping up."}
{"text":"I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEE their chili cheese tater tots. I'm a huge sucker for anything potatoes in case you haven't noticed. It is now tradition to stop by Sonic's to get my chili cheese tater tots on the way to a friend's house to watch the UFC fight. The tater tots are still so cripsy even with the chili and fake cheese sauce. It's a heart attack waiting to happen, but till then I will continue to order these on the way to watch the fight.

{"text":"Way to Fast!     Burger was under a warmer(heat lamps)yuck!   No way to cook burger in 2mins.      I ordered a Bacon Cheese Burger and at first order taker repeated back saying that it was a plain burger with bacon and cheese and I politely corrected.   Bacon Cheese Burger with everything.   I got home and to my surprise hardly anything on burger 2 skinny tomatoes and less than an ounce of brown lettuce...had to open fridge and put lettuce and mayo on and I had ordered that.   I also chose to add ketchup and mustard due to dry burger...again YUCK!     This makes me wonder how my wifes breakfast sandwich was...probably nuked it!   Frys horrible!  Cherry Limeaid only good thing!     Learn how to build a burger...very slopply!  How does this place have 5 Stars?"}
{"text":"Love Sonic's Drive in!

A group of us stopped by Sonic's after indulguing on all that is Boiling Crab down the street.

How did we manage to find space in our stomach after eating BC?!  

I ordered the Oreo Sonic Blast.  Oreo blended with ice cream, topped with whipped cream.

It was heaven but then again, you can't really go wrong with ice cream.  It was great!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in around 10:30 pm on 6/2/18. We had come in the night before and my boyfriend ordered an ocean water slush, which ended up coming out a regular ocean water. Tonight however, we were parked at one of the carhop stations and waited for a while until someone finally came across the speaker and told us it was drive thru only. We waited in line and the voice in drive thru instantly had an attitude. My boyfriend had repeated his original request and ordered his ocean water slush. The employee rudely cut him off and corrected him, telling him it was instead called a blue coconut (she continued to do this throughout the order). We ignored the snarky and stuck up voice and when we got to the window, we paid the tab. The young girl that took our payment was very snippy and short. The name on the receipt was Hannah. I'm honestly very disappointed in the lack of customer service and respect. I understand it was late and I'm sure everyone was tired, but it was all very unnecessary and rude."}
{"text":"Seriously, i hate this location!! They have messed my order up somehow, everytime i go there!! And this last time was it for me! I love putting tomatoes on my grilled cheese sandwhices, and i asked them like 3 times to do it for me so they wouldn't mess it up this time! The girl even got kinda snooty with me because i kept asking....like i was the idiot. And sure enough, i get my sandwhich and no tomatoes! And this is like the 7th time this has happened, so im down giving this place a chance. Im sorry but if I ask you 3 times for something it should be stuck in your head like wow, this person must really want some tomatoes on their grilled cheese sandwhich! Maybe we should even put extra tomatoes on there! I have grown to hate this location!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for Sonic! I love their happy hour and their chili cheese dog with onions makes me one happy camper. Frankly, all of their food is good!"}
{"text":"Two nights in one week.  Both were terrible experiences.  On both occasions I sat in line at the drive through for more than 10 min.  The first time I ordered a large banana cream pie shake.  The lady taking orders repeats you wanna ketchup pie? To keep things short I had to repeat myself 3 times before she understood me.  When I finally get my shake all of the ingredients are at the very bottom of the cup and nothing but 6 inches of vanilla ice cream on top of it. Fast forward to the second night I tried to order a chili cheese Coney and a 44 ounce ocean water had to repeat myself again three times before she understood my order twice she replies we have no ice for the ocean water is that OK?  I'm no it's not that's the whole reason I came here for a cold drink in Las Vegas.  Terrible thing is I can't even leave because the line is five cars behind me and five cars ahead of me so I get stuck buying a chili cheese Coney that I don't even want without a drink.  Two terrible trips will not return avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"I love sonic, but I had such a horrible experience here tonight. I am so disappointed. My friends and I pulled up to one of the menus in one car. 4 people total. It was a pretty long wait, but that doesn't ever bother me because I work in the food industry and know when you get slammed, not much you can do. When they got to us, it hadnt been a deal because we were all just talking while we were waiting. They got on the speaker very loud (possibly just a mic issue). After finishing our first order, we asked if we could make a separate order. They said of course just click the button again and we will take that order. I felt kinda bad, because I know split orders sucked when I worked at Starbucks, which is why we asked. They took our second order, we ordered 1. A Large Ocean Water Slush 2. A frenchtoast combo with Dr Pepper (medium or regular size) 3. A large strawberry sprite. I remember explicitly seperating all the items because we ordered the French toast, they asked the drink and we said Dr Pepper, then we asked for ocean water but they were out of pop rocks, so we asked if it was possible to do it as a slush. They said yes. We ordered a large. And then we ordered the last drink. When we got our orders the ocean slush was the wrong size (not a big deal we weren't charged for a large) and my Dr Pepper was missing. When the guy came back we tried to let him know. Rodolfo (name on our receipt) was incredibly rude. We told him we were missing it and he said K I'll be back. He came back to just hassle us about \"but it's not on the receipt\" and just was not grasping the fact that we were missing something. We were completely willing to pay for it. We just wanted to order it and get it since I was missing my drink. I think he assumed we were just lying because again he said k and went inside. He had another girl come out to give it (she was not rude) and she said sorry about that and gave it to us. When we began driving home I realized they had passive aggressively stuck a new receipt on the cup with the Dr Pepper order. WE DIDNT WANT FREE STUFF! We had just tried to politely get it fixed. We would have paid for it but the rude employee wouldn't even give us a chance. I think I love sonic's French toast sticks enough to not stop going all together, but I definitely think they need to work with some of the staff."}
{"text":"You're thinking about eating at a Sonic drive in so I'm guessing you make a lot of bad decisions... Turn over a new leaf, and go ANYWHERE else. Or you could eat here and deal with the disappointment and shame that come standard with every order."}
{"text":"Food is the same at all Sonics.  I am writing this about the service at this one.  It was pathetically bad.  The guy taking my order was beyond slow and I couldn't have ordered well if I wanted too.  No less than 45second delay between his responses for each item ordered.  Then the food took forever but no worries because while I sit here waiting for the order, that I know will be screwed up, two employees are busy working on a car parked in one of the stalls."}
{"text":"I swear I am not on an anti sonic kick I've just had two bad experiences at two different locations in less than two weeks.  Today I brought the family for a quick bite on the patio.  The ordering process was painful and took easily 4-5 minutes as we had to keep repeating ourselves and then correcting what was being added.  When we were done ordering I pressed the pay button and slide my card.  It processed and we were done.  Or so we thought.  A minute after we ordered another patron ordered a cheese burger, with similar difficulty.  (This will be relevant in a second I promise)

When my order comes it now contains an extra cheeseburger and the boy on skates tells me my prior transaction was voided and I needed to pay the new total..... For the extra cheeseburger..... That I didn't order..... the other guy did.

Undoing this mess was not a fun process and left me very disappointed with sonic.  Again."}
{"text":"The food is consistently mediocre, so I never expect too much and I'm not let down. 

Today, we ordered a 12 piece buffalo wings combo but was told they don't offer that in a combo, just the other amounts. We would have to pay for all of the other combo pieces on the side instead of as a meal. We scratch that and order the jumbo popcorn combo instead. When asked what dipping sauce we would like we say buffalo. \"We don't have buffalo sauce.\" ?!? You have buffalo wings, but can't give us a container of buffalo sauce?! 

That's below average customer service. Could they put a little buffalo sauce in a small container? Yes, because they've done it before. Don't think we will be coming back to this location, as the food is already a bit expensive for the quality, and the customer service (or lack there of) has sealed the deal. 

Though I probably don't need to point out that they gave us the wrong dipping sauce when they handed us our bag, I will. I didn't ask for ranch, thanks."}
{"text":"The guy on the speaker is extremely rude.. Would not recommend this location just because his attitude... He should represent his company in a proffesional matter. When a customer has doubt he should educate them on the product instead of saying \" just look at the picture\".."}
{"text":"I love Sonic. I would probably only give 3 stars because if he drive through wait times, but my daughter dropped her slushy and they replaced it. Awesome considering she thought the work had just ended. So the 1 star deduct is for drive though times. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"The drinks and happy hour are a great deal for anyone who loves fast food or american food in general.  The area could be cleaner, and the employees could be more efficient and charming.  The food hasn't been so impressive as the years went by coming here.  The high school years this place was a blast like all fast food, but i'm not feeling it.  It's too crowded at times and the bugs and the bright lights and birds make it a pain to eat outdoors.  The drive in style is always refreshing compared to other burger joints.  I think the bars and other restaurants with patios are still the way to go!"}
{"text":"It is 11:17pm and the website says they are open until midnight, but I'm here and it is closed already! All the lights are just turned off and no employees. Now I have to drive to a further location which is just an inconvenience. Thanks to the flamingo and Pecos area for sticking to your hours of operation. Long line probably because they had to drive further just like me"}
{"text":"This place is great if you want something fast. Never had a problem with the food or service."}
{"text":"Every fast food joint is hit and miss and there's no consistency, but I was really impressed with Sonic today. There was a huge line of cars in the drive thru, it was 102 deg outside at 3PM, but one of the girls working came outside and hand delivered orders to people to speed things up. She could have waited for the one car holding everyone else up, but she went out of her way to walk in the hot sun to get people with easier orders on their way. 2-5PM for happy hour! Half off all drinks and slushies :)"}
{"text":"I have never wanted to do this but, I am so tired of being treated like a piece of shit!!!!!!!!! I work long hours, so at the end of my day when its time to eat its should be satisfying? When i went to sonic on southern and val vista, in mesa and just had the worst services known man. i order the number 1 meals only to receive it with no lettuce or totmatoes which i was told that they didn't have any. i was fine with that, but when i receive my order the fry's were so cold and hard as if they made them in the morning, and final decide to serve them to me later on that day, the burger was awful with over saturated mayo and mustard i finally had enough, and I ask  them, NO told them to remake my order,  and they brought me  a fresh burger that surprising had lettuces totmatoes and everything eles on it this time i guess the found some in the back  ...... but the damage is done..... for store to have a slogan that says serve fresh daily what  a JOKE   Let me leave it at this................. I WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN"}
{"text":"Went a hour before closing and ordered a number 2 and a cony meal along with a sundae. I was told the icecream machine was down and not working so i just got my meals. A car pulled up along side us and ordered to of there blasts and was able to get there icecream and food before ours. I asked the lady that brought the food out about the icecream machine and her response was we use 2 differnet kinds of vanilla icream.... that doesnt make sense! Very unpleased."}
{"text":"Use to be good service I don't know what happened. Last time I waited 15mins for 2 drinks and ended up leaving with out anything. Then today the same thing I happened after 10mins and still didn't get my ONE drink I just left."}
{"text":"Went there last night.  Girl who took my order was barely whispering back to me that I couldn't understand her.  Went there today and after I ordered my food I wanted to quickly add something else but the girl would not respond, pretending she couldn't hear me.  I was so pissed off at this I drove off without paying.  I like sonic but the customer service here is incompetent"}
{"text":"Worst sonic i have been to. The staff is rude and can never seem to get an order correct."}
{"text":"I'm from the state that this chain originated in and it makes me sad to see this place so poorly ran. They don't carry any change on them so they have to go back inside. I've been here twice, both times just for drinks and it has taken over ten minutes each time. Mind you there was only two other cars here at that time. I now know why so many of these are shutting down around here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick meal and shakes for dessert! The drive thru line was super fast!!! In addition, service was friendly and our food was spot on for a Sonic. The sonic blasts were excellent! Good location!"}
{"text":"The service was absolutely terrible. The chicken wings didn't even look like real chicken it was purple. The workers were rude and the manager looked like he was drugged. Multiple people got there food before us. Never going there again"}
{"text":"Sunday almost 3 pm and it took just over three (3) minutes to get two corndogs, large tater tots, and two large fresh fruit slushes.
Service was efficient and young lady was polite too.
Nothing like I had anticipated after reading other reviews.  So hurray for that."}
{"text":"Really good service this evening and they were busy.
Took advantage of the half price shakes after 8 pm instead of dinner tonight.  Sorta torn cuz my shake is weird.  I think they mixed it wrong cuz it is not a chocolate cream pie.  There's some funky syrup or something in the mix that tastes more like suntan oil.  Blah.
What happened there?!
Well I did have polite service and they apologized for order taking so long. 
Any other time I would've went back and had my drink remade but too tired to care on this particular evening."}
{"text":"Do not go in the drive thru! This is your warning!

Why do I come here? Oh, that's right, for that GD magical ice! It's $2.49 per bag, and just delightful! I figure, hey, go in the DT because you only need to order ONE FACKING ITEM, and there's only 3 cars ahead of you. Should be quick, right? NOPE. 23 minutes later I finally got my bag of ice... which melted at the bottom. Why didn't I get out of line? Because I was already vested, plus with my luck it would've taken another 15minutes to get it.

Some of the car hops are nice, there's a lot of parking spots... some in bad positions though, like, right by the DT. 

I've only ordered food here once, corn dogs, which were cold when I received them. Corn dogs... those things that come out of the deep fried HOT... oh well.

Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I don't like spending close to $20 only to open my food and see part of the order is prepared incorrectly."}
{"text":"Cherry lime aid? Yes, diet of course, 460 calories and 120g of sugar on a rt 44 is a no no with me!

Sooo Sonics are usually all the same, same menu, pricing, and annoying order speaker. The first time we came here the experience was pretty ok, this last time it was sheet! Pure sheet!

So after 8pm shakes are half off, this time I opted for a cherry pineapple in medium (2.99 for med) and a jr deluxe burger no onion or tomato. 

So I press the button and the lady comes on. I give her our order and mind you I speak verrryyy clearly and slow so she can understand. She repeats the order \"you want 2 double cheeseburgers no onions?\" AHHH! NOOOO!! 1 jr deluxe burger no onion no tomato. She spits the order out again and it seems to be correct and gives us the total which is like 5$ over. So I sit there in awe and push the button to ask how this came about. Ohh I forgot to give you the discount for the meal. So the total is now 2$less. I ask her to repeat my order and again she includes the double cheeseburgers! I politely tell her no, and repeat what I wanted.

At this point in time Im like wtf? I cant find a job but they hire this yodle to work here?! So out comes our car hop. She repeats our order and what comes out of her mouth? 1 jr deluxe burger... the 1 thing I CANNOT STAND IS TOMATO. It legit makes me puke!! So I look at my burger and low and behold TOMATO AND ONIONS! Im about to go ape shit as we are leaving, like seriously? I have spoke slowly and clearly and told you my order 3 times and you STILL cannot get it right? WTF!? Plus my shake tasted like garbage AND she didnt give me a full discount on it!

Now I wouldnt be a little jerk, but if I tell you an order like 100 times, it should be correct! I didnt call and complain I just ended up tossing the onions and tomato and wiping the tomato remnants off my burger.

Will I come here again? Probably, I do love their diet cherry lime aids! Their workers are just somewhat of ding bats!"}
{"text":"This location always has problems. We get the wrong orders every time my family goes here and even worse we get serious attitude from the employees every visit.  They will argue with the customer instead of fixing their mistake on an order.  I have only had one assistant manager treat my family well when we have gone to this location by the name of Iggy so if you have problems ask for him. He at lest gave my child a small strawberry shake for messing up his food order and because the worker there argued with my wife (again happens every visit) rather than fixing the issue. If it were not for him then I would give one star easy."}
{"text":"Wish I could give least than one star. It took 30 mins to get though the drive thu. There was only 2 cars in front of us.  I have never been to a slower place. My food was cold and not up to what sonic has been before. I will never go back to this one again."}
{"text":"When your family sends you on a late night munchie run, and you have 15 minutes to get back in time to watch the new tv series that's airing. Sonic is the go-to. Everyone is quiet and eating their ice creams, so I presume they are satisfied and happy! Everything was yummy, the service was nice and fast paced."}
{"text":"Horrible service, all I ordered was two kids meals and a drink and they took 15 minutes to bring my food out. I even press the red button again because I was convinced that they forgot about my order. Won't ever be returning to this location"}
{"text":"I love Sonic, and I come from someplace where Sonic is not readily available (but is advertised, go figure). So being around opportunities for Sonic is pretty awesome, and I finally got my first fix this past weekend. 

At 4 AM after my girlfriend and I left XS, we decided to hit up this 24 hour Sonic. The service was good, even though the drive-through line was long, but they made it through things pretty quickly. 

I got a burger meal with cheesy tater tots, and my girlfriend got a corndog also with some tater tots. 

All of it was... pretty good. Not great, not bad. The burger was good but I found it lacked a ton of flavor. After eating upper scale fast food burgers like Five Guys, Whattaburger, and In-N-Out, I just kind of felt like the burger here was 'meh'

I would certainly go again, and I probably will, but the proximity of things like In-N-Out make it difficult to go anywhere else for fast food."}
{"text":"Sonic runs commercials and the employees don't know what's being advertised. I asked for their new shake that I saw a commercial for and the dude at the drive thru window responds, \"I don't watch TV\". Really?"}
{"text":"The worse customer service, they literally just stand there and gossip. Wait time is ridiculous because they're just standing their talking. Drive through worker was super sassy when we asked a simple question, since we couldn't see the menu we've asked what flavors? And she gave a snarky comment."}
{"text":"Luckily their drink's are good. But more often than not, my order is screwed up. Unfortunately I went against my better judgement and returned to this location again.  Guess what.... They screwed up the order. Totally forgot to put one of the meals in the bag."}
{"text":"This is surpasses the Arrow wood location. 
How so? I ask for extra syrup but don't think I needed it based on how juicy the drink was....however I did it because I'm so used to the slushy being dry from Arrow wood. 

Corn dog was cooked fresh after we ordered and didn't sit under the light. 
Pleasant service. 
A bit off the beaten interstate path but worth the 1.2 mile detour as the location is next to most everything."}
{"text":"IDK what the other reviewers speak of when they mention BAD DRINK at Sonic. lol...yes I do. HOWEVER, I will say Middleton just hasn't gotten it right & it further lets me know there's a reason some things are local/regional - it just can't be replicated unless you grew up with it. Sorry if that offends but look, I CAN'T MAKE GRAVY LIKE MY MOTHER SO I DON'T MAKE IT AT ALL. No need to jack up a good thing with my crap. 

Here's to the review:
1) Child ~ honey child. Talk about excited when this place opened up north. I told my family between Chipotle/Sonic/Pizza Extreme all in this area... I\"M NEVER LEAVING MADISON. 
2) Sonic is the place that I learned about in '97/98 in Baton Rouge, LA. And they are the old school location. No carhops, no updates, ain't too clean looking but I was hooked...YOU HEAR ME HOOKED after my 1st slushie. 

Now to Middleton. I had my therapist and her office excited to try this place after going on about it for 20min of my session. Then I started booking appt's before or during HAPPY HOUR. As I would never buy a drink at Regular price. IT' S JUST AGAINST MY GOOD UPBRINGING. lol

4) First week in town, I laffed & I cried (figuratively) mostly~ I whined. 
I laffed at the people that would park their cars and try to walk in. 
I whined about the traffic. Just because it's new doesn't mean you should try it during the opening weeks people. 
5) Now, I cried when the drink order would take 30minutes or so. 
6) One worker asked me, \"Man you really love this place\" in his lil' snide way. No really he was being rude 4 no reason. I quickly pointed out - \"You should be glad I do...it keeps you with a job.\" NO TIP FOR HIM. I guess he thought about it cuz he looked stupid & held his head down.
7) Lately, I'm doing better with my addiction. Y'all think I'm joking? After 6-8weeks at home; I had a cavity. My mom quickly stated, \"It's probably from all those slushie drinks.\" MAN I wish I could have her lil voice playback inserted right here. Her epiphany probably was right but I won't admit it. But at home they were selling Large Drinks for 99cents before 11am. Happy Hour came 2x a day. A we got new locations every 6weeks. And it wasn't even summer yet. OMG..they're soooo good. 
8) I love seeing the skaters that skate in Middleton - they're good. 
9) I have had Manager's handle some sticky situations and they excelled. 
10) Love the specials for Tues/Wed/Thur - 5 for $5.95 burgers/Kid Night/College ID night, respectively. 
11) I'll take Sonic over McD's anyday. 
12) More options (meaning the menu gets extensive like a Culver's)

COMPLAINTS:
I promise the service is just generally bad up North (or shall I say thru the Midwest because Palatine & Carpentersville, IL are confused too) 
2) It's not just the staff but the population doesn't know how to order. 
not their fault, no one's teaching Sonic etiquette around here (but I would love to)
3) Silly staff doesn't know/hasn't been taught/or refusing to realize - if we're at the drive thru & I order a drink behind some large order - JUST run my drink order over & keep the line moving. They are catching on NOW (like 2years later).
4) The surly attitude of the Hispanic woman that works the window. She's worse than any old black woman, I know, working in a hot kitchen in the SOUF (no typo) put the emphasis on the \"F\"
5) Inconsistency - which should be no#1. That's why folks that are complaining are complaining. I know what the drinks should taste like. Somedays they get it & other days they make me want to put on an apron and teach 'em. 

*Positive: They are drumming up business 'cuz every weekend I get an email to buy a half off ticket thru the \"BuckyBook\" email list serve. 
I hope they can make it thru the kinks of starting up & sustain themselves. 
~As for the food. Just think Culver's. Stay away from the Hotdog's though. They are just too salty nowadays. CORNDOGS are still decent but they keep some fresh bread. For the hotdogs & burgers.UMMM fresh bread (in my Homer Simpson voice)"}
{"text":"One word for this place - NASTY.    Worst hamburgers in Mesa period!!!!!  In fact just about all Sonics are this way today.   What happened to the Sonic we used to know, when the burgers were big, fresh, and hot.   Back then, the fries were great, and the value and selection were good too.  Today - NASTY.   If all of the Sonics in Arizona are franchised by one person, heed this warning.   Either improve your food, or you will be out of business and alot of people out of work.   I've already complained to corporate once, and the next call I make will be the CEO of Sonic.  That's assuming waste my money at another Sonic.   Regardless, he needs to hear just how bad this Sonic and others in Arizona have become."}
{"text":"Terrible service, rude car hops... ordered cheeseburger with bacon and it had no bacon 
Asked for a cheeseburger with bacon and they said they would take care of it 
Never came back
Called them again
Finally got the burger , gave the guy a frickin tip even! Asked for some ketchup, he never came back either 
Fuck this place, never coming back they suck
Terrible customer service
The one star is just so I can post it -5 star is my rating"}
{"text":"Not the worst location I've been too. Since they're in the Walmart it gets pretty slammed. Their customer service at times suck. Not offering a drink or fries with an order you would have thought already came with it. In the end, the food is pretty good so can't complain there."}
{"text":"I live in Los Angeles, and there are absolutely zero Sonic's in my area.  I occasionally have an insatiable craving for Sonic, so when I see one I have to get something.  I persuaded my group of friends to stop here while were were recently visiting Las Vegas.  We had just eaten dinner down the street, so I was now on the hunt for something sweet.  We went through the drive-thru and I ordered a Cherry CreamSlush.  As always, Sonic did not disappoint!  My CreamSlush was spectacular, and I am still salivating thinking about it a week later.  It reminded me of a cherry 50/50 bar in a smoothie like liquid form.  I have liked every dessert I have ever had at Sonic, but the Cherry CreamSlush may be my favorite.

I just can't express how much I love the fast food at Sonic...especially the desserts!  It is a great indulgence for me, and I always look forward to eating here again.  Until we meet again Sonic..."}
{"text":"This location makes the best strawberry cream slushes. Perfect ratio of ice cream to slush. The staff is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This review is only for the deserts.

We came here after eating down the street at Dos amigos (very good).

I ordered the creampie shake and loved it. You gotta try em"}
{"text":"All I can say is, thirty minutes for three ice creams. I could've milked a cow and made the ice cream from scratch faster."}
{"text":"Went for a blast. I asked for chocolate syrup to be added into my cookie dough blast. So far I have had maybe 5 of the tiniest pieces of cookie dough. My cup is broken and instead of either remaking it or switching cups they simply stacked it into a new cup with styrofoam mixed into my ice cream and it's clearly not mixed well. Im giving this rating a three because usually this is a solid location but this is a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"Worst service... They always forget an item or two. Making me wait even longer. Both times left without my complete order.

Tempe location is better. The wait time seems long at both places but I think it's normally consistence.

The service is just the worst though at the Southern location"}
{"text":"We come here a lot because it's around the corner and we love the happy hour menu. Food isn't so great but the blast and slush are our favorites ! Love getting the text of the deal of the day also."}
{"text":"By far the worst place I have ever eaten. It took forever to get our food once we were finally able to order. They got our order wrong (I ordered a footling hotdog with no bun(I an allergic to gluten) and it came out with a bun). when we intercomed them about the hotdog they said it will just be a minute longer. 10 minutes later the hotdog came out (not a footlong). We tried calling to the car hop and she ignored us. So we left. 
Btw it was the worst hot dog ever. Tater tots were soggy and cold. Simply terrible. I won't go back ever agin. Don't waste your time of money"}
{"text":"I ordered a foot long pretzel bun coneys. It was a regular bun with not cut bacon no cheese on it and they messed it up by putting onions on it."}
{"text":"Me and my family went here last night and ordered a whole bunch of stuff including  A chicken strip dinner when we got home we open the box and found that there was no onion rings and Texas toast was falsely advertised. So we called and the shift manager Anthony was very nice about the whole situation and gave us a free chicken strip dinner so the next day we came to come pick it up And we open the box before we left and there was only one onion ring in the box so we pull up and asked for the manager and shay came out and was acting like a complete bitch She got surprised that we were asking if it Only came with one onion she said yes with a attitude and a stank face. As we were driving off she continued to look at us with a very ugly bitch face. Like come on who wants to eat one onion ring I know she would be disappointed if she open the box and only had one. I know she was back there eating the rest of the onion rings. ANTHONY AND NICHOLAS were very good employees and SHAY needs to get fired."}
{"text":"Placed order had to correct the order more then 1 time while ordering. When order was served 80% of it was wrong. Called to get this corrected and they came and took the food back. Then served us with the order still 50% wrong... will not be back"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Sat in the parking lot and pushed the button for 10 minutes with no answer. So I pulled around to the drive through and it still took a few minutes to acknowledge me. There was only one other car there. Now I know why. Also had time to write this review while waiting at the drive through window. Still waiting."}
{"text":"So like the other reviewer said, I also really love 50's-esque restaurants, so of course that's what originally drew me in to Sonic. I love the drive in and everything is reasonably priced and of course eating in my car with my friends with the windows down when its nice outside is fun!
I mostly come in for Hot Fudge Sundaes when I have the craving and they're always so yummy. Also whenever my boyfriend and I have done the drive through they've been speedy!"}
{"text":"Poor and slow service. My order is chronically incorrect and I have yet to see an adult managing all of the teenagers who appear to be more interested in socializing than doing any part of their jobs. I would recommend only purchasing drinks and only braving the drive through line when it's short and you have a decent amount of time out of your busy life to waste sitting in your car! Disappointing to say the least! The owner would be well advised to spend some time in his/her restaurants!"}
{"text":"Good god, this location is terrible. Sloooow service, rude employees... just generally awful. I've given it a few chances over the last year, just in case they were \"off\" that day. Nope, they just suck."}
{"text":"This is the Sonic closest to our place and tends to be our first thought when we need a quick lunch or dinner. Unfortunately the wait can be long, but I've experienced that at other Sonics. The staff is very nice and rarely mixes up our order. (Once I asked for a certain toy and they didn't have it right on hand but offered to go through their sealed boxes of toys for it! Very nice of them.) I always go for a Route 44 Apple Limeade! It's the best stuff ever."}
{"text":"It's a pretty good place. There milkshakes are amazing. As well as the fries, they are to die for. Definitely one of the best fast food fries ever. Food is pretty good. I walk here sometimes because it is close and it's nice to eat outside but it would also be nice to sit inside or have a seating area where you can sit inside. When ordering food on foot, outside, it's sometimes hard to hear what they say through the speakers. But other than just a few minor upgrades, the food is delicious and I love coming here to hang out with friends and get a milkshake."}
{"text":"I literally never eat fast food, so I didn't know what to expect when my boyfriend and I went through the drive through one night to satisfy our urge for a hot fudge sundae.  Service was pretty slow.  I know that this location is new/probably still working out the kinks, but maybe this is the norm for a place like this?  Don't know.

I'm a picky eater and a food snob, so I wasn't overly impressed by my ice cream. I should have just gone to the grocery store, bought a pint of Mitchell's, and called it a night. But it was worth a try, I guess.  I really have no desire to go back, but maybe if you're more into fast food than I am, this is your kind of place?"}
{"text":"the ice cream desserts were so refreshing on a scorching day in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Sonics. They are WAY at the other end of healthy and low sodium. However!  When you are looking for a splurge in your diet, Sonics has several treat options. I personally only favor the beverages. I like all the beverage mixins, shakes, and ice cream options. My go-to treat is a Cherry, Watermelon, Vanilla, limeade. There is also a daily Happy Hour from 2pm - 4pm and drinks are 1/2 price.  One of my other favorite things about Sonics is their ice. Their special tiny crunchy cubes definitely enhance the drinks. They also sell 10 lb bags of it fir under $2. 
   The food is pretty 2 star quality, but what can go wrong when Tater Tots are on the menu. The menu is also Toddler friendly. When you need food in a pinch to feed your just fed, but suddenly starving animals in the back, and don't want to get your whole tribe out of the vehicle, Sonics can be helpful.  They don't bat an eye when I order a plain, no bun hot dog, small Tater tots, and apple slices."}
{"text":"Worst experience. We went inside to order.Picked up the phone to order and waited. Finally someone answered and I ordered and never got a response. We waited ten tried again and the same thing happened. We waited even longer. Nothing. We were fed up and walked out. My husband knew I really wanted sonic so we went through the drive thru. I missed my half priced bc we had been inside waiting but whatever. They're lucky they still got our money."}
{"text":"I believe in second chances and I have one to this Sonic location today. 


Never again. 

The quality of the hired associates is way below par. The attitude, the communication, and overall service is just horrible. 

Then the very sketchy issue that happened today that will make me call my bank to ensure I am not charged anything on my card just puts the nail in the coffin. To hand me my receipt and my card and then tell me you have to run my card again even though I've been given a receipt..... sketchy to say the least and piss poor customer service."}
{"text":"This sonic has horrible customer service and the can even get a route 44 ounce cup of ice right. Ordered a bag of ice , girl screams \"I need a bag of ice \" in the back like she is at home in her pajamas. Gives me a large instead of extra large water, then when I say thank you she doesnt say anything and just shuts her window . I love sonic, this manager needs to get this employee a mop and keep her away from customers"}
{"text":"The worst service location!!!  All I wanted was a drink a corn dog snd s bag of ice and I waited over 25 minutes parked after I ordered and I even tried the call button and calling the store!!  Seriously disappointing!  I have a baby and was looking to be able to stay in the car but not for over 25 minutes!!!"}
{"text":"I've always loved going to Sonic. Cheap eats and drinks that tastes better that McD's or any other fast food places in town. My bf loves their malt shakes. I love that I receive texts informing me whenever they have daily specials (like .50 burgers or .99 hot dogs). Food comes fast and the carhops are usually friendly."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst sonic experience to date. We ordered two burgers with jalapeños and mayo and a grilled cheese for my daughter. They still messed up our order after repeating it 10x's.  When we told them before paying, the employees started arguing back and forth about it. We finally got our order and the burgers were cold. They just threw cold slices of cheese on it and didn't bother to try to melt it."}
{"text":"This location is the worst! You either have incredibly slow service or quick service but they get your order wrong!

When the service is slow 80% of the time your order is correct but room temp. I ordered tonight and was the ONLY car in the drive thru. I ordered a caramel snickers concrete and ended up with a snickers blast which is the same thing but with vanilla ice cream. I guess I'm to blame I didn't check my order before I left but if you want minimum wage to go up, get stuff correct since it's not difficult to put caramel syrup in vanilla ice cream"}
{"text":"Just went there, had not been to a Sonic in awhile, now know why so many have closed.  I ordered a double cheeseburger without onions with mayonnaise, had to try to order three different times, she would not listen.  When my burger comes out, it is full of onions, no mayonnaise, and COVERED in mustard.  They offered to  make another burger but I did not want one at that point and am now feeling kind of nauseated from what I ate."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times.. every time I get my food is always cold and the hamburger buns are always soggy liked it  sat there for a day and it doesn't matter how many times that you say I don't want tomatoes or I don't want onions it always ends up on your burger it's like they don't even listen. The customer service at this location does not even deserve one star it deserves nothing. I think they need more training on how to be better at customer service if they want this location to do well. I will be telling everybody else to not come to this location"}
{"text":"If I could give them a zero star review I would. Based solely on the service they managed to give me a completely wrong order and then proceeded to tell me that what I ordered was not even an item on the menu. Which it clearly was as I checked the menu and even the sonic website. The servers were also rude as well as slow as it took me twenty five minutes to get my order. Try an avoid this sonic location if you can."}
{"text":"I never really had Sonic til I moved to Vegas. I love the tater tots. Had the popcorn chicken, i had to douse it in ranch cause it's usually dry/bland. For some reason, I really hate their Chicago style dog, but i love the New York dog."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  Ok, it's fast food....that's why, but it's really good fast food.  We were heading back home and needed to make a stop for a quick bite to eat.  We pulled up and ordered the whole menu at those little old-fashioned speakers that are in your individual parking spot!  It was so cool.  Then the Sonic workerS brought out our food!  It was a neat experience; like going back in time.  The food was deliciOOOOso!  it was great.  my hubby had a burger and i had a chicken sandwich, fries and we sampled a drink...got a sundae and a shake.  We like to eat a lot, OK!  we don't have a Sonic near us, so we wanted to load up and try as many items on the menu --- we didn't go too overboard, but left feeling contently-stuffed.  the food was good enough to go back and definitely worth trying instead of sticking to Mickey-D's."}
{"text":"I had just eaten at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. What is wrong with me that I need to eat chili cheese tots afterward? and french toast sticks? and a huge apple limeade? and an apple juice slush? (i was thirsty and my tipsy body wanted apple juice)

i felt sooo nasty after this binge, so what did i do? what everyone does in Vegas. i gambled and drank some more......eeeeewwwwuuuhhhhh.

thank god for sonic. something needed to soak up all the liquor."}
{"text":"We did not have a great sonic experience this evening, and we normally do at a different location. First we had to correct the guy taking our order 3 times. We then waited 15 minutes for our food. When it came, the girl just started handing it to us without saying a word, I was waiting for her to read off the order like they normally do, but she just said have a good night as she started to walk away. The food was meh. Chicken was hot and tasted ok. Tots and mozzarella sticks were fine. Hot dog tasted old and looked dried out. Grilled cheese was dry. We also realized after we got home that we didn't receive any sauces with the chicken and mozzarella sticks and were never asked when ordering."}
{"text":"Order took 15 minutes to come out and when it did it wasn't even correct. I also had a coupon and it didn't take off the right amount. Check your food before you leave!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever extremely slow no matter what u order and what time of day or hour of the day you go. Shouldn't take 20+ mins for one soda in the drive thru during non happy hour specials."}
{"text":"I love Sonic on road trips, food is always good, service is nearly always mind boggling fast...this restaurant was the exception for fast service.  BY FAR the slowest Sonic I've ever been too.  Food was ok, but 10 min at drive through when it wasn't busy is just silly."}
{"text":"They're okay here. Last visit, they got the shakes all wrong.   We got home, and banana cream was coconut with chunks of banana in it.   The Six year old didn't appreciate that. This visit, everything was spot on. They're a little challenged sometimes, though. Pay attention to your food once you get it."}
{"text":"40 minutes in the drive thru.   Lmao.  What a joke.   Never in my life.   Hope my order is right.   Who let these clowns by a restaurant.  Not sure i even wanna eat now.  25 bucks shot to hell.

Update.    I had a 4 minute ride home, and the food was cold and un-eatable.    Amazing.   Never again. Absolute joke to the peeps that own this place."}
{"text":"I come to this Sonic on occasion, I would show up more often if they'd give out more coupons. The food is somewhat pricey.

My food tasted good; no issues with the temperature of my food, or long wait times.

My visit was an average experience."}
{"text":"When it is over 110' in AZ and I am a cranky and sweaty mess, a fountain drink with pebble ice in a styrofoam cup is at the top of my list of needs. 

Sadly this location was not the best, or even close to it, that I've been to. The woman taking my order was rude and not very helpful. It took forever(!!!) for our drinks to come out. I should have timed it, but it was way too long for just some soda and slushes. And then, we were only given 3 straws for 6 drinks, and then the car hop was gone, so we had to push the button again to summon them for more. It was just kind of an inconvenience, after the slow service, when I was so hot and just wanted to gulp my soda."}
{"text":"When it is over 110' in AZ and I am a cranky and sweaty mess, a fountain drink with pebble ice in a styrofoam cup is at the top of my list of needs. 

I was shocked to see the low stars for this Sonic location. I mean, yes it is Sonic and the food is pretty terrible, but the drinks?! You just can't beat em! 

And this location had super fast service and our car hops were very friendly! I was impressed! 

Route 44 Diet Coke with lime for life!"}
{"text":"This location sucks!!! Why do you have a button that tells you they will be there in a sec and never come after 10 pushes of that button. Nobody takes your order and it's midnight and I waited 20 minutes for nothing!! If you don't have enough people to work a SLOW night close off some of your carports if you can't handle it or at least let me know what the hell is going on. Communication sucks, nobody even comes to take your order. Sonic"}
{"text":"Its a drive trough. And its the type of drive through employed by mostly high school kids. That being said, they provide their function. Sonic always has the best cold drinks. Thats what i go there for. When its 111 degrees out, nothing hits the spot like a watermelon slush. The food is fine. Burgers and burritos. Not great. But fine."}
{"text":"Half Price Drinks from 2-4pm @sonicdrive_in daily got me in the door for a cherry limeade which was fantastic ...BUT I made the mistake of ordering a chili cheese dog which had to have been the WORST hot dog EVER. It was like a boiled cheap gas station weiner with runny flavorless chili. YUCK:( 



Now I remember why its been awhile since I last ate at Sonic-just bad fast food still trying to survive on the car hop nostalgia totally missing it on the food"}
{"text":"Face it Sonic is the sad depressing version of Dairy Queen. The food is complete garbage and the shakes make you gain 80 pounds. Let's face it sonic employees probably goes dumpster diving in Dairy Queen's dumpster and try to pass it off as there own. Every time I've ever eaten there food it's been just completely disgusting and gave me the runs. If any sonic employees read this i just want to let you know your life must be depressing if you scooped that low to work at a disgusting knock off of Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"Frozen strawberry lemonade is my absolute go to. Looking forward to dabbling in the new flavors. Try to hit happy hour here. I stopped by after working outside for four hours and I needed a large... 2 drinks cost me $6.

Pretty sure their specials are before 10, 2-4 and after 8."}
{"text":"We hit this place up frequently because it's just around the corner from us so it's on our quick dinners list.  Basic fast food stuff, a little better than most chains, and quick"}
{"text":"Do not go to this location. I have found a bug in my drink that I drank as well as my CHILDREN. Then when we go to the location to address the situation , An employee had the audacity to smile and laugh about it. Then stated to my husband \"Oh I'm scared.\"The employee's name is rashida. Don't ever go to this location unless you want to get a high amount of protein through bugs and become sick."}
{"text":"This seems like a strange location to me. I still go there. sonic is a chain, that because of their drive in/ park and eat style dining, the locations should be on main cruising \"drags.\" It seems to want to be closer to Sunset. Hmmm... 

Still, great food and great service every time I've been there. They have a happy hour which is cool. all locations I've been to have this, where slushies are half off from 2-4:00PM every day.

They have tons of floats, limeades. cream smoothies. they can mix just about every flavor ever. And it's not all sugary syrups, a lot of their flavors are fruit juices and purees blended in. 

They had/ have? a dollar menu. It was at the Flamingo location across the Palms and then suddenly gone. They may be erratic depending on location. 

they have delicious tater tots, also, but you have to ask for tots when you get a combo meal, or they'll automatically throw in fries. The burgers are kinda plain, but they have a hugr toaster burger on texas toast that's great.

Great way to preserve the drive in dining experience! I wish A&W continued their chain the same way."}
{"text":"First when we ordered the lady was very rude on the speaker phone. Then we order and our ice cream blast seemed like it was water. It wasn't even ice cream, we politely asked them if they can fix it. They never came out to us, so we had to Call out to a car hopper. He came up asked for the receipt for some reason. He came out with another one and had Like red sauce in the ice cream when it shouldn't have had that it was a regular Reese's blast. Drive to a different one if it means better service and products."}
{"text":"Service is bad, wait times are long, and food is continually messed up. I've also noticed that it's always a surprise what kind of dipping sauce you actually receive with your order. After a 20 minute wait in the drive through, you find yourself too frustrated and wanting to leave. Once you get home you check the bag finally and see that you got a messed up order or the wrong sauce. Pretty irritating."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the half price shakes after 8pm during the Summer was better"}
{"text":"One of my least favorite Sonics to go to but is conveniently located close to home. Almost every time I go to this location my order is incorrect and it takes a while to get your food. The only reason I'm giving the few stars is because the staff here are nice and friendly. The premises are generally clean."}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego and there are only two Sonics in Diego.  At first, I was excited to eat at this hyped up burger place because one finally opened in Santee.  If I ate at Santee, when it was newly opened, I would have driven for thirty minutes and waited more than four hours in line.  No joke.  It was big news when it opened.  Most San Diegans don't know there is one in Northern San Diego.  And, hell no I'm going to wait that long for fast food or drive up an hour to get food.  So, I waited until I went to Vegas.  

I was very excited to eat my first Sonic burger, but after one bite, I was disappointed.  I believe In-N-Out and Burger Lounge is better than this.  Maybe even Hodads.  However, I'll give a star for their variety of drinks and happy hour.  Plus, you have an option of tots or french fries.  

Sorry Sonic!"}
{"text":"The food is always good for fast food. They're not always the quickest, but chili cheese tots are definitely worth the wait! Pop corn chicken and corn dogs are always a good cheap option as well"}
{"text":"They're nice. They screw up my order but they're nice. Sonics is always good when you need a cheat meal. My go to are their lime aid slushies, tater tots, and mozzarella sticks. This is the closest one to me. They need to put more junk food in Summerlin."}
{"text":"Just like any other sonic. The food and drink taste good and the service was pretty quick. It's on the strip too so it's close. Amazing because in la they are hard to find."}
{"text":"I went there last night and got 2 Optimus prime slushes they were horrible the customer services was horrible Alexandra/alex took my order and she was being very disrespectful she didn't get my order right! She needs to be fired very rude, and she has no customer service skills!"}
{"text":"I came to sonic about 11:40 on Halloween night and I tried go order food because I love right there and they told me they were closed"}
{"text":"Fist of all you all make me sick. How can you talk smack on sonic when they are dope as hell. They are the only fast food corporation that serves the cutting edge new meat product 'bully sticks'."}
{"text":"I grabbed a burger/tots from this location on 12/2/11 (I typically don't eat \"fast food\" but I was in a bind.)

About 3am the following morning I was sick, I have spend the last 10 hours or so throwing up and cementing my ban on fast food.

Customer beware, nothing feel worse than food poisoning. This is not just upset stomach, it is full on horrible."}
{"text":"I just left this piece of crap Sonic and I will NEVER EVER return. I ordered no mayo on my burger. My receipt says no mayo. I get home and their is EXTRA mayo on my burger! I proceed to take the 10 minute drive back and tell them about their mistake. The first thing out of the woman's mouth is did you eat the burger?!?!? Are you freaking kidding me. I ordered no mayo for a reason so no I didn't touch the damn thing. No apology or anything. To top it off, my fries that come with my combo are cold by now. They didn't offer to replace them for the inconvenience. I asked what about my fries and the woman tells .e she doesn't know if they can replace my fries. I'll never return here AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service and rude cashier.  Waited for breakfast ten min for breakfast and I was the only car there. The person Inside just kept staring at me and talking away to other employee. Very unprofessional and I would never go back."}
{"text":"Easy order but really? We ordered a large chilli cheese fry and when we got home and opened it, it was half empty and no fork given to eat with. Not exactly top notch"}
{"text":"Burger was GOOD and I loved the tater tots, too!! Didn't get a chance to try everything since we only went once!! Can't wait to try more, IF I COULD FIND ONE IN THE BAY!!!!!

Didn't give 5 stars for the fact we pulled into the drive-in and when we pushed the button for them to take our order, they tell us they are closed and go to the drive through (BOO!)...we really wanted to take advantage of that...I was shocked that it was closed at 11pm-in Vegas on a Saturday!!! I THOUGHT NOTHING CLOSES IN VEGAS!?!"}
{"text":"I typically only order BLT. Since the Bacon is the most important part of the sandwich you think it would be FRESH.  I guess i should nevet assume.  They put old crunchy bacon bit pieces .instead of slices of bacon. NEVER OLDER BLT ...."}
{"text":"First time I ate at a Sonic was in Florida back in 2010 during a roadtrip I took with a friend. It was love at first bite as I love burgers and onion rings. And the cherry limeade though!??? Omg, I was infatuated. So infatuated, that I must have ate there a total of 4 times during our 10 day stay.

Back in Cleveland, I was distraught to find out that the closest Sonic was located near Kent. *cries* A year or so later, I found myself in the Kent area and stopped by. Hmm, I thought, it wasn't as \"omg marry me now you beautiful, delicious food\" as it was in FL but still pretty good. I was satisfied but not overjoyed.

Fast forward a year, I see a sign on Mayfield boasting, \"Sonic Coming Soon.\" I almost jumped the curb. When it opened, I waited a month because it was always packed - a good sign, or so I though. I ordered a bacon burger, onion rings and a Rt. 44 cherry limeade. 

Welp, the burger was DISGUSTING. The bacon was undercooked, my bottom bun had CAKED on flour, just yuck. My onion rings were mushy and gross. I threw away most of the food (and my money) away. A far cry from my 2010 visits in FL. The only thing that was tasty was the cherry limeade. 

I will never eat at this Sonic, or any Sonic location in OH for that matter, again. The only business they will receive from me is on a hot day in the summer for their limeade. 

They seriously should just sell limeades."}
{"text":"Yummy frozen lemonades! I couldn't pick just one so I went with both blue raspberry lemonade & the cherry lemonade :) Tastes like a slurpee but way better! lol"}
{"text":"We parked at a stall and pushed the button multiple times in a few minute span. No response, so we went through the drive through. We ordered 3 shakes and the girl dropped one of the straws on the ground. We asked for a third straw and she replied with \"I think you still have enough\", then handed us the third straw. Very rude and unexpected."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Sonic I've experienced. The line is always long because they make every customer wait 10 minutes for their order, no matter what time of the day it is. Every other sonic is very fast paced and knows how to keep up. Ordered $14 worth of food to only come home with $10 worth of it. They ALWAYS seem to be forgetting part of the order. Overall terrible service."}
{"text":"I live around the neighborhood and my family loves sonic. Me on the other hand not so much, every time I come to this establishment I am always having to return as my order is NEVER correct. Simple instructions are very hard to understand and when they mess up You Would Expect Some Concern Or Desert But Receive none. The employees never have a clue about what car oder what, who ordered what and what the order was... ordered a cherry limeade slush no lime... drink came I asked does it have lime she said no. Tasted it and it had lime, I asked for no lime lady tells me she thought I ment no lime peel ... ??? For my bad service I asked for a strawberry shortcake smoothy and was told can't do it due to the price difference. I explained my past service and she reconsidered and came back with a mini lmao I ordered a medium drink and was bought a mini how is that great service. But also for my trouble I was given a free ice cream cone coupon !!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst sonic. I am a teen myself but these teens didn't even know how to work. They messed up my order and didn't give me a drink. Then when they gave it to me they gave me the wrong size. I wouldn't go back here ever because they don't know how to cook or make anything. Then all they did was talk to each other and grab whatever they saw and put it in the bag. Then one of the girls was giving dirty looks. My food also came out cold since they cooked and made the other orders drinks. Worst sonic ever !"}
{"text":"They literally forgot my chicken strips and flooded my hotdogs with mustard when I didn't even ask for mustard. I give 3 stars only because they said I could come back and fix it."}
{"text":"Sonic has ok food for a drive-in.  They do have tater tots which I love.  They also offer them topped with chili and cheese.  On this trip I ordered the popcorn chicken with chili-cheese tots.  If you are in a hurry or just need a quick lunch this is an ok place.

The one noteable downside is that it is not a good place to meet people for lunch.  They offer outside seating, but that is not a fun thing in Las Vegas in the summer.  As long as you are in the same vehicle there are no issues."}
{"text":"One of my son's favorites. Service here is consistently fast and friendly.  I like that the chicken sandwich comes on a whole wheat bun. He likes that they serve the whole menu all day so he can get a corn dog and tater tots for breakfast.  It is fun to eat outside on their picnic tables also."}
{"text":"Late night service is awesome. Order was quick and customer service was friendly. Sitting outside is not hot, very calm and not too chilly. Food is same as usual, nothing changed. Oh how I missed you!!!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru which was slow. I found that the frozen section (ice cream products) were printed much, Much too small.  I couldn't read it which was frustrating b/c I'm not familiar with their menu.

My waffle cone ice cream cone was ok but the peanut butter cup topping was only candy dust. Obviously, the bottom of container and very disappointing. Not only that fact but there wasn't very much of this dusting of candy topping.

Finally, the ice cream wasn't creamy; a little lumpy. Don't get me wrong... I ate the entire thing but I won't spend the $3.50+ on a cone again."}
{"text":"You can never say one sonic is better than another sonic. They all taste the same. The greatest thing about this Sonic's is that it's in Vegas! You've been in line for the club for almost 2 hours, you finally get in, you spend over 2 bills on drinks, you're sweating your ass off, you now have blisters from those damn heels, and it's 4 am and you're starving! Look to the Palms, it's not a Mirage, it's SONICS and it's open 24 hours. How can this place get any more convenient for Vegas? You don't need to get your tired drunk ass out of the car to order food. You don't need to worry about who will watch your friend who is passed out in the backseat like dead weight because you can just eat on top of them. Rehydrate yourself with limeades cause you know you're thirsty from all those shots. 

PS. Coney chili cheese dogs, chili cheese tots, and mozzarella sticks always hit the spot!!

Don't be surprise to wake up the next morning with food stains all over the top you just bought at that miracle mile shop."}
{"text":"This Sonic is really hit or miss all the time. This particular location happens to be on my way home from work so it is super convenient for me if I want to pick up something on the way home on the rare occasion I haven't prepped dinner before going to work. It's also helpful when the husband calls me when I'm getting out of work begging for a Sonic Blast... 

Sometimes there is no one in the dirve-thru line and it is slow. Sometimes there are a ton of people in the drive-thru and it is slow. Sometimes I've come through super quick. Again, the consistent factor is missing. 

The good thing though is that the food is still good quality for a fast food joint. I tend to think of Sonic being on the upper echelons of fast food. There are a lot of options and a lot of ways to customize your meal. Their drinks are always great, especially slushies and their Cherry Coke, which I love because they do not skimp on the Cherry flavoring.

I'd rather go to a different Sonic, but since this one is on my drive home I'll probably keep partonizing it whether or not the service is slow."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to give the 5 Star rating, but I gotta do it. This Sonic hits it on the mark every time I've been here.

My boyfriend and I must be having coinciding sweet tooths lately because we have been hitting up this Sonic late at night to get some yummy ice cream concoctions. My boyfriend's go-to is always the M&M Blast and I usually switch between the Oreo Blast and the Chocolate Shake. I love their drinks. Sonic offers such a variety - shakes, slushes, sodas, and the sodas! I love that their Cherry Coke has a REAL cherry flavor and they top it off with a cherry!

Sonic also offers more than just your ordinary fast food fare with delicious hot dogs and the option of onions or tater tots instead of fries. The burgers are always good to me. I love their brown bag special! It's such a deal. How can you pass it up?

Never met an employee who was rude, although 90% of the time I have been through the drive-thru and not the pull up windows so not a whole lot of interaction with them. 

Sonic is a coveted institution that we in Las Vegas take for granted. People love this place and hate that they don't have their own where they live. Amazing that us Las Vegans can indulge all we want!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe the horrible level of professionalism at this location.  Don't come unless you want to wait 20 minutes for and order and you want it delivered cold and wrong, TWICE.  Then the manager doesn't care.  I frequent Sonic more often than I should and this was by far the WORST experience.  Do yourself a favor and go ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"I wish I could put zero stars. Because this place is unacceptable. They are extremely rude and don't know how to ring in waters correctly or any drinks for that matter. And I don't know when it started costing seven dollars for water from sonic but that's ridiculous.  Then when we tried to say how the order needed to be wrong he said it was not on special only the other drinks are and that this was the order it was in such a rude manner. I'd recommend any other place in SONIC and SONIC is doing a great job of doing everything they can to start losing money and losing my business and everyone I know."}
{"text":"I've always loved sonic and I'm so happy this location is near me. The staff is always friendly and everything is great. Laquesia (I hope I spelled that right!) was really helpful today"}
{"text":"This is a good place to stop before you make your 4 hour trip back to LA. I've always wanted to try this place because of all the hype. Sonics is a rarity in Los Angeles. I like the unique drive-thru ordering style but overall the food was pretty average. Tastes like your regular burger joint. Also, because the server brings your food in their little roller blades you gotta tip. Not that that is a bad thing but... I don't know, I guess I'd rather just go to a restaurant. Every time we head back to LA, we stack up on food from here."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes in the drive through for a \"custard concrete\" or whatever its called. There was no line in front of me. The food orders behind me both got their food before me. Had to leave before I received it because I had to get back to work."}
{"text":"We went to try the new slushes that have been advertised on tv and told ourselves we'd try the pickle juice slush.....We chickened out lol, but the Tigers Blood slush was tasty and the Blue Hawaiian was a close second. Since we were on a roll with our taste testing my son also got a Oreo cookie bites blast. He inhaled it so I'm guessing it was good ha ha . The lot was clean and although they were busy our drinks came out pretty quick."}
{"text":"Came during happy hour to get a dink. I went through the drive thru and was helped right away. Very quick service and I was in and out within minutes. Easy access in and out of the parking lot. Very clean outside and smiling employees. All of my favorite things. By the way my Cherry Dr Pepper was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest location, but my kids were starving and it was easy to get to. Ordering was easy, but our food took quite a bit longer to get to us than any other location we've been to. After about 10 minutes we received our food. It was mediocre at best. We ordered a chicken strip family meal with onion ring, bread, tator tots, corn dogs, and wi he. The chicken meal was rediculous. The chicken wasn't strips at all but more like tiny popcorn chicken. It was also very hard to chew. Needless to say my kids were still hungry after what was supposed to be considered a huge meal. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"My kids have been dying for this Sonic to open for months. It had been so busy every time we come, but you wouldn't even know it by fast they are. Within five or so minutes our food has been brought out. Great service both times. Tonight for Halloween we went for 50 cent corn dogs. That made my son so happy lol. We definitely will be here often."}
{"text":"Yuck, you get what you pay for, cheese fries had a piece of American cheese microwaved over fries....disgusting"}
{"text":"I come here for the Happy Hour Drinks, Blue Coconut to be specific.  Ok people, fast food is going to taste like fast food, because it comes out fast. Let me say fast 10 more times... FAST FAST FAST FAST FAST FAST FAST FAST FAST FAST. This isn't Fancy Smancys, JEEZE.  Let me blow your mind, request them to sub out the red chili for green. BOOM"}
{"text":"This is a good sonics. Stopped by to pick my siblings some grilled cheeses and fries with apple juice. Quick service and fresh fries.  Yum"}
{"text":"I'm always amazed at how the restaurant is called SONIC and yet the service is always slow as molasses.  This particular location lacks a drive-thru window so you're definitely going to spend some time waiting for your order.  The lot it occupies is also poorly laid out as you can really only enter from Cooper Rd. and the property makes a weird loop with the parking lot."}
{"text":"I try to find a sonic anywhere I go since we don't have many in Los Angeles, so while in Vegas I thought this was a great idea. It was a nightmare from the beginning. While at the drive thru window, the lady dropped our cash out of the window into the steady breeze. Then as we were pulling away, we weren't given any straws. Once back to the hotel, we also didn't have any napkins. We got a few items, but we also ordered a grilled cheese...that had bits of tomato stuck on the bread, and I hate tomatoes. Plus on one end of the break inside with the cheese was a big piece of jalapeño, something I also don't like. Won't be going there anymore."}
{"text":"How can ya not give a good review? Car hops don't exist anymore ya morons! Different types of food than other places. It's fast food! You order, ask for anything extra, they put it on. BAMM!!"}
{"text":"They make my favorite fast food meal.
Mayo #1 with TOTS!!
I have been to this location a couple times. The staff has always been very pleasant. The kiddos love the balloons.

I look forward to this cheat meal. :)"}
{"text":"DONT GO HERE!! First there were about 5 cars in line and it took a total of 20mins to make it to the ordering post, so that sucked. Totally gave me large cups when I ordered route 44 drinks. Didn't realize that till I ordered 44's from another sonic and was shocked by the size... Thanks for gyping me or at the very least not being honest that you (possibly) didn't have the right size cups anymore... AVOID THIS SONIC!!!"}
{"text":"Just waited for 15 minutes for a large tea and frozen lemonade. Every time I try this place it is worse. Then had to wait again for my change because she didn't have anything to make change with."}
{"text":"Thanks for having happy hour sonic."}
{"text":"First when open it's proper to have you drive thru menu light working. Second your staff needs to know the menuand POS system.  That being said after several attempts and the girl still couldn't get the order correct, we moved on. If employees are not trained properly you lose customers."}
{"text":"Not ever again! After sampling the overpriced yet average to sub par food over the past years, we decided to try the Custard Concrete. The commercials drew us back in. BAD idea... The service was slow. It took us over 20 minutes to receive two (2) custards $12. When we got home, 5 minutes later, there was no custard anywhere in sight. It was Soft served ice cream with some syrup. We even put them in the freezer overnight to harden them up. Nope, that didn't work either. It was still soft. There are plenty of better places to eat in Henderson and less expensive to boot. I gave them one (1) star based on Sonic's awesome ice."}
{"text":"Volunteered for a local non-profit in this area years ago, and frequently stopped here on my way in . . . For drinks, that is!

When it comes to refreshing summer concoctions on the cheap, Sonic is hard to beat. 

I love the Diet Cherry Limeades and the Lemon Berry Slush! 

Not a fan of Sonic's grub; the mystery meat burgers are pretty sketch. But the Mozzarella Sticks aren't bad!  

Everyone here was very friendly. Great service too."}
{"text":"I never write negative reviews on yelp but I have had multiple bad encounters with this sonic. From being charged for mustard packets to not offering complimentary waters. They have slow service unprofessional staff. And I will never eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Wanted a quick bite in my car before work.. Started with brining me the wrong food.. Eat the hog dog to realize I didn't have a straw...Then bring me the right sandwich, but missing bacon and cheese.. So for a place to eat in your car I've had to get out of my car 3 times now to fix multiple things... No attention to detail what so ever...."}
{"text":"Horrible shakes were watering there was no flavor and my friend found a wrapper in her shake"}
{"text":"The worst experience I have ever had anywhere. We pulled up to the drive in area. Pressed the order button waited 6 minutes and no response. We pressed it again. No response again.  We went to a different spot. Pressed the button no response for 6 more minutes. After 20+ minutes of waiting we decided to go to the drive thru...a car who was playing the same game of order tag followed our lead and went to the drive thru like we did. After another 10 minutes waiting in the drive through we finally got to place our order. When we pulled up to the window to pay they said our order was going to be $14 some thing dollars (we ordered $20+ worth of food). They had messed up a simple order of 24piece buffalo wings and two hotdogs. We had to wait for them to fix our order. Then we were told to park at the front to wait for our order. More than 1 HOUR later we received our food. I have been to this location about 10 times and have always had horrible food and/or service. This is officially the last time I will ever come here."}
{"text":"I love the food here, I really do. But the employees are lacking in basic intelligence and listening skills. Every time, and I mean EVERY TIME, I ask for sauces with my order and I get home and no sauce. Who wants dry ass chicken strips and fries? Really? Use your heads. I shouldn't have to ask multiple times to get sauce. It's even more disappointing since I usually get it to go and by the time I realize they messed up AGAIN it's too late to go back. Really disappointing service."}
{"text":"Ordered what I always order and when it came out without whip cream, I asked for it. The guy said \"no it doesn't come with it.\" I asked if I could get something else or receive a refund so they took back the drink and said they'd cancel the purchase. I told them I needed a receipt and after 10 minutes they sent someone out to tell me it was cancelled. Once again I asked for a void receipt. A complete waste of time when they could've provided good customer service and offered to add whip cream. I would've even paid for it if they'd offered to do it. Manager stated they threw away the receipt. I informed him of the poor customer service and he was very rude and sarcastically acknowledged he could've just given me the whip cream without charge. Worst excuse for a manager."}
{"text":"I love the happy hour slushfest. $2.05 for a pair of medium slushes? Yes, please!! This particular Sonic has a drive through as well and they give a ride along dog a good treat too!

The food is alright, always made correctly. It's fast food, don't expect anything fancy. But the prices are cheap and when I feel lazy it's my go to place."}
{"text":"I dont have one of these at home here in seattle to go to :(
But the two times Ive been here have been delightful.
I love their toaster sandwiches...hell everything on their menu sounds great, especially when being in vegas is all about over-indulgence anyway...
The highlight of my experience here was trying to figure out how to order off the board via walk-up service..I was totally new to it..that and eavesdropping on a guy talking about hooking up with a girl who had \"so much hair on her chest you could braid it\"...
Ahh..vegas."}
{"text":"I like Sonic and this one isnt too bad.  Always seem to get my order right, decently fast.  My issue is why do all Sonics stack the burgers sideways??!!  They're all messed up by the time I get home.  If youvre going to stack them sideways then bring them out sideways and hand it to me sideways!!!  Otherwise stack the damn burger perpendicular to the bag!  And get rid of the natural cut fries.  All other restaurants have tried them and ditched them already.  Catch up Sonic."}
{"text":"Normally the ultimate meat/cheese burrito is pretty darn good. However lately they have been serving up premade heat lamp versions that are soggy and disgusting. I know this, because I called and that was the explanation I was given by the manager. I explained that when their not fresh you can totally tell, and they go from good to totally bad, her solution... next time request that it be made fresh!

Long story short, I asked for it to be made fresh the next time I went there, and it wasn't!

Shame on you for being this lazy, shame on you for thinking that I cannot tell the difference. I won't be going back... side note: probably better for my health anyway :)"}
{"text":"This location is amazing I've never had a problem here there half price shakes after 8 are amazing"}
{"text":"Gave them a $5 tip. I get home and they forgot my popcorn chicken. Not worth making the drive back to get it corrected so I had to take to loss. This is after my brother in law was charged for items he did not order. So much for second chances."}
{"text":"Wow between Filibertos and Sonic this has to go for the slowest service especially at Drive Thru.  Tonight all I got was a Slinger burger and still waited 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Love there food! Double bacon cheeseburger and tots. Have to get tots whenever you go here. Always fresh and got it right away. Always make sure I come to a Sonic whenever in AZ. Hope they expand to WA so I can go more often."}
{"text":"I can't imagine making it through a hot summer without my Route 44 Diet Cherry Limeades to keep me cool, so I'm a frequent visitor to the Sonic Drive-In back home.  While visiting Phoenix over the July 4th week, this Sonic, on the North side of E. McDowell between N. 48th and N. 51st, became my go-to drink restaurant of choice.

What is unique about this particular Sonic is that there is a drive through, but no drive through window.  Feel free to ponder this for a moment or two.  There is a menu and a speaker where you can order whatever you like, and then you pull forward to... a solid wall on the side of the building.  No window to hand them your cash, and - most distressing of all - no window where they can hand me my humongous frosty beverage.  Well, okay, I did eventually receive my beverage as one of their servers walked out the front door and handed it to me where I tentatively pulled up to the edge of the curb.  Now, I know what you're thinking - Sonic is basically a drive up restaurant where they park and bring your food TO YOU, so why would I insist on driving through?  None of your beeswax, buster, I just do.  

In addition to driving up and parking to order, there are plenty of outdoor tables, most with shade, where you can also sit, order, and enjoy your food or beverages.

So, do whatever your little heart desires: park and sit in your car, park and sit at the tables, or order at the drive through and act really confused when you can't find the drive through window.  Just make sure you try the cherry limeade - trust me on this one."}
{"text":"What is the point of having an order window if it doesn't work? I mean the main selling point of this place is that you drive up to a machine press the button order your food and off you go. But here you have to play the guessing game on which one is actually operational! Have the sonic employees never heard of a sign indicating that something is out if order? Or does this location just not care and enjoy watching their customers aimlessly drive from spot to spot trying to order? You know this was one of my favorite places back in Texas they really took pride in providing great service this spot is just sad in so many ways. Had I not mentioned my card couldn't run through the machine they would have let me just drive off I think maybe the manager of this location could use a little work on how to properly run his location if not I wouldn't ever want to return it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Evidently this location really doesn't care about repeat business. After waiting in the drive thru 20 minutes the manager I asked to speak to was a total b=%\h. She was snotty and rude. If I hadn't already paid I would have driven off. I will never go to this sonic again. I intend to let as many people know about this kind of crap as I possibly can!"}
{"text":"I don't like their food. But their drinks- Yum!"}
{"text":"Drinks are good- Food it gross except tots. I never go there to eat just get drinks..."}
{"text":"Just tried the new Wholly Guacamole hotdog and WOW, best hot dog ever!!

It's kind of hard to put it into words, but the combination of flavors are just spiritual..."}
{"text":"The past few years, I've grown less and less a fan of fast food restaurants (as old as that makes me sound).  But the kiddos really love Sonic, so whenever we're out and about running errands a quick stop here always does the trick in transforming my grouchy riding mates into happy helpers.  

First off, the words \"Happy Hour\" always seal the deal for me. :)  This Sonic's happy hour version is offered from 2pm-4pm with 50 cent corn dogs and half price drinks/slushies. Our personal favorites are the real fruit slushies, the Ocean Water soft drink and the Cranberry flavored iced tea.  Their small $1 breakfast burritos are not bad either.  

The service is adequate here - they've never gotten my order wrong or kept us waiting too long. So we are returning customers, thus far.  :)"}
{"text":"Awful. Wife wanted to eat here so I stopped. I asked for chicken sandwich with no tomatoes and it came with tomatoes. Asked for unsweetened tea and it came out sweet. Went inside they refilled it but it was still sweet. They did this three times before I said forget it give me dr pepper. Then the rest of that night I was on the toilet with food poisoning."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to grab something to eat before our movie started and we decided for Sonic, right accross the Cannery. We got off the car and probably looked somewhat confused because not even 5 seconds passed when a young man came out and showed us where the menu was and to press the red button once we were ready to order. When we were ready we placed our order and within a few minutes our order was brought out to our table. Food was good and customer service was great!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this review as I love Sonic but only for the Happy Hour.  Half price Shakes!!!  How can you go wrong with a banana shake?

Well while waiting for our order I started to read the reviews.  Most of them were negative due to the amount of time it took for their orders to come.  Others were issues with the wrong food being delivered.  Funny thing is, we also waited a while for our food to come.

Yeah, that knocked off a star.  Then when I look at my shake, it looks as if it was sitting there for a while cause the whip cream was melted.  Then when I stick my straw in there, I hit huge chunks of bananas at the bottom.  They could have blended it longer.  Worst part of it was that it was more whip cream than ice cream.  Lame.  Take the drive to another Sonic if you can."}
{"text":"The food came out fast and fresh and there was friendly service. They always get the order right and get you in and out in a timely fashion. I've been to the sonic several times and the kids love it so I will continue to go back for a quick fast food option. Sonic always has new trendy options like pretzel buns and croissant buns and brioche buns."}
{"text":"We went here for national hotdog day! One dollar per hot dog is a steal of a deal but don't worry, sonic still made their money on their specialty drinks. When we went through the line, it was quite a wait but it was fun because it was obvious to everyone was at sonic to celebrate the national holiday. I really felt a bargain when I could get meals and drinks for three people for under $10. The employee said they have other fun specials throughout the year so stay tuned"}
{"text":"We love Sonic in general, but this location is the worst we have been to. Employee took forever to get my order right.  Had a somewhat large order for our family of 5, so expected a slight wait. Didnt have a wait, but they didnt have an item we ordered and thry didnt let us know until after we paid. They offered to swap it out for a comparable item, and we agreed. Said item was $.20 more. I figured it was their mistake so theyd just cover the twenty cents. Nope! They wanted me to pay over $2 MORE to \"upgrade\" a size. 

It was something so small that shouldnt have been an issue but the guy was such an idiot that it became a bigger issue. He didn't understand the simple concept of fixing our order, and then had to void it all out anyway. So annoyed."}
{"text":"Every time we come here they take as long as possible to bring your order out. If you're in a hurry, don't go here."}
{"text":"Took forever to get our basic ice cream order. Was at the window waiting for 10 minutes. Charged me $1 to sprinkle ten cents of candy in it. Then they were tiny and she forgot the bottled water!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.   Close at midnight,  but arrived at drive thru @ 11:55,   waited for 7 minutes just to be told they were closed.  And as I was driving away one of the employees leaned out the window  to say \"Thanks for visiting Sonic\"

Just hung up after waiting 20+ minutes on hold on their \"customer care\" line to tell them about the incident.  

Nice job Sonic.  Epic fail.

Wish I could give this location and Sonic in general 0 stars.."}
{"text":"Always a long wait but I understand because I do know they are he busiest Sonic in Arizona. Food is always great, very nice employees, my order is never wrong no matter how busy it gets. My favorite location, much better than Val Vista."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Overall this was a very pleasurable experience. Area was well kept, clean, and no rift raff loitering around. Service was quick and efficient. The gentleman that took my order was polite, courteous, and we'll spoken. My food was exceptional, the tots were (as kids nowadays say) #onfleek. My ONLY complaint (not really a complaint) was that I had a tad too much ice in my beverage. I think they underestimate the insulation capability of their cups!

I highly recommend this Sonic location. They run a tight ship here. Salute!"}
{"text":"This sonic is pretty bad when it comes to customer service. The window helper sounded like this was the last place she wanted to be and looked it as soon as I got to the window. I'm not expecting perky and perfect but friendly and alive would have done just find."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. I don't even eat there anymore due to the cold scrappy food, long wait times, and messed up orders.... It's happened every time I've ate their... So I've completely stopped eating Sonics food... I'd rather go somewhere else and spend my hard earned money, where I will get good food and  service...."}
{"text":"Very poor service at this location. Today at 3:30, I sat in the drive thru for 15 minutes and the line never moved. Finally, the person ahead of me got out of line and I was able to as well. I do not recommend this location"}
{"text":"Two words.. Purple Sprite.

Order that and you will be happy.. trust me.. I'm a.. Yelper?.. 

For real though, it is part of their secret menu, so they may not know exactly what it is..  That's what happened to me.  But luckily, when we read the ingredients, the guy immediately knew what it was.

Purple Sprite: Poweraide, Lemonade, Cranberry Juice, and Sprite.

Also, they close the parking spots where you order at after midnight.  We saw cars already there, but we arrived shortly after midnight and that is what the guy told us.  Nonetheless, order the purple sprite ;)"}
{"text":"Side of green chile was not worth the extra cost. Asked for no mayo, my order came with double mayo. Maybe it was opposite day at this location."}
{"text":"I've come here on a few occasions, usually because I'm on my way home and in a hurry to get something on the super quick. In terms of other options that I have on my route, there's also a KFC and a Taco Bell, so...

I want to like Sonic. I like their commercials, I like their cool drinks, and I like their concept. But I can't get behind this place 100%. Nothing here is exceptionally good, I usually have to wait a long time, and the prices aren't even super low. 

I'll continue coming here every now and then, but I'll never do it over In N Out."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the phone you have to pick up to order your food. Had to go wash my hands before the food came out. Dog was OK. Milkshake was average."}
{"text":"Terrible services is the ideals of this sonic. When you have to try to order 3 times and they don't acknowledge you till you walk away there is a problem. I understand being short staffed but atleast acknowledge the customer and make an attempt to start the order process. Can't even comment on the food because the service was so bad."}
{"text":"Do not pay with cash at Sonic. Even though they clearly make it an option to pay with cash, card, or the app... The employees do not know how to make change. And it will take much longer for them to go get a manager to come help them make a change and count out bills. Absolutely amazing that even on your first day on the job, you cannot do simple math. The bill was $15.51, and I gave the carhop a $20 bill and 51 cents exactly. I literally could not have made it more easy for someone to make a change and get back to simple five dollar bill. Instead, the carhop thanked me and started to walk away. I had to ask her for change. Flustered, she went and got a manager who came out and apologized because it was her first day. Then he proceeded, not to just give me my change, but to scan the receipt and walk the young girl through how to give back five dollars to a customer! She handed him for dollar bills and asked him if that was enough. Are you kidding me? He patiently told her one more dollar bill was needed. I was absolutely dumbfounded. The food is always great at sonic, but this review is for the service. Especially when paying cash. I don't know whether to be amused Or incredibly disheartening. Mental note to never go to sonic unless you're paying with a card or the app. Clearly, even though they make it an option, they don't want you paying with cash, or else they would train their employees how to make change."}
{"text":"No. Just...no. 
I can't believe how appallingly bad this place was on my visit today. The food was all dried out, hot dogs were mushy with soggy buns, too much mustard, barely any other toppings.  Had to hunt someone down for condiments.  
Forget the clever commercials. Id rather eat peanut butter and jelly. 

Never again."}
{"text":"We got the replacement meals with no real issue a little confusion about one free meal or two but the manager said she will do the two we got home with hot fresh food with some extra onion rings. The management steeped up thank you no five stars because of the hassle. We will go back again thank you."}
{"text":"Really poor quality food and slow service. Thankfully they finally patched up that giant moon crater at the front of their driveway."}
{"text":"They messed up my order I asked for a chili dog and I got a corn dog but the service is really friendly and it was fast I was in and out of the drive-thru"}
{"text":"Sonic's...oh Sonic's 

How many times do I have to be deceived by your commercials and pretty pictures of your food? 

So here goes, as a late night guru, one must be thoroughly acquainted with late night fast food drive thrus. This Sonic's is on West Sahara, about 5 minutes from where I live: definitely in my comfort zone of travel. All the usual fare of Sonic: sundaes, burgers, and limeades. All done well here. I suggest drinking your cherry limeade with a peppermint in mouth and caramel sundaes here. I usually stay away from the burgers and sandwiches because they usually hover around bland. Grilled cheese, tots, and stuffed jalapenos are also notables. Chicken fingers are also decent. I suggest eating here if you're not in the mood for the same old JITB, McD's, or Del Taco. More pricey than the usuals but well worth the novelty of dessert at 2am from a drive thru...namely because all JITB and McD's turns off their ice cream machines in the twilight hours. ^_^"}
{"text":"Went  in for smoothie, one for my daughter n one for me n it took them 45 minutes and to top it off he didn't even get my order right n when I told them they didn't even take care of me instead they ignore me n the manager there don't even care. Worst place ever"}
{"text":"We went to the Sonic in Orange County, CA and weren't impressed. This Sonic in Henderson was a little better food wise, but its the same old \"welcome to Sonic, we can't get your order right\". Now, they took care of their mistake, but it would be nice if you could walk in and order face to face instead of talking into the stupid box... then to top it off you swipe your card at the machine outside? 

If you like an OK burger and don't like to talk to people face to face this is the place to go... if not In N Out is down the street."}
{"text":"What is it about Sonic that screams \"our customer service sucks\"? It doesn't matter which one we go to or what we order there is always some punk kid walking out giving us attitude because they got the order wrong or didn't hear us mention the coupon we have. Tonight was no different. We walked up to the menu board to order and the first thing my wife mentioned was that she had a coupon for $2 off her purchase. The guy talking the order said \"ok\" and asked what she wanted... easy enough right? Nope, not for Sonic as the guy came out with her shake and asked for payment... when he saw the coupon he stormed back in (With the shake) and when he came back his first words were, \"Next time you need to tell us you have a coupon when you place the order\". Hmmmm, I thought we did that... The place gets 2 stars because my wife loves their milk shakes."}
{"text":"Went here about an hour ago.  My slush cup was broken and got all over . I went back in line and the manager apologized and replaced my drink. This was very kind and I always love coming to sonic for a late night fix."}
{"text":"I dont eat fast food. However. I consume diet coke, coffee, and diet cherry limeades like its my job. This evening I went for a ride and found myself parched. So. Diet cherry limeade it was. I told the pleasant drive through attendant my order and pulled behind 2 other cars waiting for their order ahead of me.

I had a long day and needed to zone out (hence the planned drive). 23 minutes later it dawned on me. I HAD BEEN SITTING IN LINE FOR 23 MINUTES FOR A CHERRY LIMEADE.

So no.
Just...
No. 

For a Monday night at 10 pm, come on. What in the...."}
{"text":"This place was kind of stressful to order and eat at.  We went in a group and wanted to eat at a table, so we opted for the patio (they don't have a dining room).  You have to order through this walk up speaker system, and I had to shout everything I wanted several times.  I actually spelled out \"Jill\" twice, a pretty easy name.  I almost went for the \"You know, like Jack and Jill... went up the hill...\"

Once we were seated, the food came out quickly and the staff was really friendly.  But all around were a ton of people shouting at each other on top of the people shouting into the speaker system, spelling out things like \"My name is B-O-B\" or \"that's a D-I-E-T coke, to make up for the extra mayo on my bacon burger\".  It was hard to hear myself even think.

I think since it is their opening week it is just too busy for my social anxiety to deal with.  Maybe I'll go back in a couple months."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm not gonna \"review\" this Sonic. I mean, it's a Sonic. It is what it is. For fast food it's  okay, and they have a bigger variety of menu items compared to other fast food places, which is nice, but there's one think that irks me about THIS Sonic (when I would probably give most of them 3 stars)...they don't have an area where you drive up, park, place your order, and have someone deliver your food (and IIRC, occasionally by roller skates)! It's either drive-thru or walk-in, like any other fast food place!

To me, the whole drive-up & park is Sonics \"thing.\" It's what sets them apart from other fast food places (okay besides the hot dogs, whatever that frito/cheese thing is, the sandwiches on toast, as well a gazillion types of drinks). 

Sorry (this) Sonic, but I've experienced better."}
{"text":"this sonic is very good and the customer service is amazing the people are so friendly and my meal is never fucked up"}
{"text":"Unreal! We ordered 4 drinks here, waited 20 minutes and pushed the button again to ask what was happening. They apologized and said they accidentally gave our order to a drive thru guest. What? They said we will start remaking it now. Waited 5 more minutes and they brought the drinks and asked for more money. I already paid. Done with this place! Look at my reviews. I am not one to complain but this was ridiculous!"}
{"text":"We waited in the drive thru for 25 minutes, staff is super inefficient didn't park anybody if their order was gonna be a while to help the line move more quickly."}
{"text":"Sadly Sonic never pops into my head when it comes to fast food and I wish it did more often cause the chicken sandwich on Texas toast, corn dogs, and tater tots really hit the spot...especially after a night of drinking. Oh and how can I forget the slushes...no brain freeze on a hot Vegas summer night. Very polite and friendly staff here. Only blemishes are the construction makes it very difficult to exit and prices are high for fast food."}
{"text":"Slushes and ice floats are what this place is about.  Their selections and combos are insane.  Some are really sweet some are tart, some just are damn good.

Hot dogs look good too."}
{"text":"One of the few indoor sit down Sonics I've encountered.  I've always had fast and friendly service here.  Their seasonal pumpkin pie shake is quite tasty!"}
{"text":"This Sonic was pretty busy when we arrived, but the got our orders placed and delivered to our car in a speedy amount of time. The diet green iced teas are some of my favorite drinks on the menu. They are very refreshing on a hot day and you can add different sugar free flavors too like peach, mango and raspberry.  They are currently offering their half price shakes after 8 deal which provides some extra incentive to visit for a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"This Sonic closes their park and order system after 11 PM at night due to security concerns they say. Hmmm that isn't too reassuring for my safety when I order here. As a result, there was a huge line for the drive through. At the drive through, the screen that shows your order to confirm what you've said was out of order but thankfully the person taking the order understood what I said through the speaker. We only ordered two drinks and since it was an easy order for them to make the cashier came out shortly while we were still waiting in line, took our payment and delivered the drinks to us which was much appreciated. 

I had a diet green iced tea with peach. It had a good balance of syrup to tea and was cool and refreshing. 

We came here because it was on the way back home from a concert so this probably isn't a Sonic I would normally be frequenting but overall our experience here was A-OK."}
{"text":"This Sonic is a bit grubby feeling and not in the best location but our order came out quickly and accurately. The limited edition wildberry lavender shake is definitely very interesting tasting with that hint of floral essence in the drink. The one thing that always bugs me about their shakes is that the straws they give are regular thin straws which don't suction very well with the rich thick shakes so you feel like you have to have a vacuum cleaner for a mouth to be able to get any bit of shake through the straw."}
{"text":"When it's so hot you can fry an egg on your car, Sonic is on your way home, and it's happy hour (Half price drinks 2-4), how can you resist? I also had a voucher for a free medium drink and I ordered using the drive through. Wait time wasn't too bad, only a few minutes. 

I didn't get a receipt but the order was fairly simple so I guess I don't mind too much."}
{"text":"They really need to get a better drive-through speaker.  I had to repeat my order 5 times after waiting several minutes to even get someone to take my order.  When I went to the window, my order was still wrong, which was then fixed.  I got home, to discover that even with the correction at the window, they gave me the wrong shake.  I've had problems ordering from this drive-through almost every single time I've been here, but this was the last straw.  Never planning on ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Gut busting happiness resides at Sonic. One of my favorite food items to get here are the chili cheese tots. With the half price drink happy hour every day from 2-4, and the summertime half price shakes after 8, this is like my new second home! So far we haven't had any order mix ups at this particular location, and service has been fairly speedy.

P.S. My favorite shake so far is the pineapple-banana."}
{"text":"love the cherry slush and the variety of hotdogs you can choose from...chili cheese and new york dog are my favorite"}
{"text":"The kid here aaron G ispot on awesome service..i realy appreciate it in a world that doesnt honor the customer as much...bright spot of my day...thankyou"}
{"text":"I went to this Sonic at about 10 in the morning I was the only person there.I placed my order for the Sunday special chicken dinner served all day long for 5 dollars.I asked for french fries instead of tater tots and I upsized my drink I get to the window I waited about 10 min. She finally opens the window and tells me that you cannot upsize when you order a special deal and you cannot change tator tots to French fries I have orderd 5 dollar boxes at Taco bell and they ask you if you want to upsize your drink Sonic if this is your policy you need to change it you are the only fast food restaurant that does this if you want more customers you need to be more accommodating."}
{"text":"We make a point to visit this great Sonic while in Vegas.

Not only is the food good and the tater tots addicting, but the service is so good at this location. They come to your car offering more condiments and check in on you.

Speaking of location, it's just a few blocks away from the Strip and across the street from the Palms. I love it!"}
{"text":"This place puts a glob of ice cream in whatever size cup you order, puts whipped cream and a cherry on top of it, and calls it a shake.  I'll have to let it sit outside in 100 degree heat for two hours, so maybe it'll thaw out of the Arctic freeze it's in, and I can drink it without bursting all the blood vessels in my face and getting a hernia with the all the straining. What a rip off."}
{"text":"When they can serve fresh hot fries I'll give them 5 stars. Everything about this place is great, and they just can't seem to serve fresh hot fries. It doesn't matter if I ask them to bring out fresh hot fries to begin with, they still being out cold chewy fries. Several times I have spoke to managers, sure they replace fries, but why have to go through that several times at all. Please reset the times that the fries sit out. Toss them out once they are warm. Only fresh hot fries should be served to patrons. Get it right Sonic."}
{"text":"This drive-through is terrible. Just went there for food before work. Waited in line with only one person ahead of me over 20 minutes. Only to pull out with no food because I had no more time to wait as I am headed into work. Thank you sonic for starting my day off grand. Maybe you should get your stuff together and learn how to be a team and Service the customers. There was no one in any of the other areas only one person ahead of me in drive-through. Rediculious!"}
{"text":"I am very glad there is a sonic finally close to my home. I really just like to come here for the beverages. Why is the service so slow every single time I come?"}
{"text":"Got a craving for late night ice cream, but most everything is shut down, so I ended up at Sonic. I pulled in about 11:30 and pushed the button to put in an order. Granted, the place was busy. But a couple minutes later, with no reply, I pushed the button again. A couple more minutes pass without even a hello. So I get this genius idea of going through the drive thru. I pull up behind a car and wait another few minutes. The passenger in the car gets out and walks up to the window, apparently they hadn't asked his order. He comes back frustrated, gets in the car and they drive off. 

So I wait a couple more minutes at the drive thru window. Nothing. I pull up to the window. The people inside avoid eye contact. I hear a kid mention me. A lady says he should shut off the lights of the drive thru. It's 11:50 now and they close at 12. So, I pull back into the same spot I'd first pulled up in and push the button. Thirty seconds later, a guy actually answers. 

\"How are you tonight?\"
\"Is your drive thru broken?\"
\"Yeah. We got the light shut off now.\"

Okay. So I order a Strawberry Shake and a Dr. Pepper Freeze.

At 12:10 they bring it out. But it's a Strawberry Shake and a Grape Slush.

Press the button and get the chipper young man again. I explain that I ordered a Dr. Pepper Freeze. He says he'll get it right out. 

Lady shows up with my \"Dr. Pepper Slush.\"

I didn't even take it.  \"Dr. Pepper Freeze?

\"Yeah it's Dr. Pepper and...slush?\"

\"Ice cream?\"

\"Ice cream? Like a cream slush?\"

\"Um...Dr. Pepper and Ice Cream.\"

\"Like a float?\"

\"yeah but blended.\"

\"Oh, so like a blended float.\"

\"Okay, sure. Let's try that.\""}
{"text":"Trying to have a cheat day and they cant even maintain their machines. For how much they push their shakes, I find it hard to believe they would let this happen."}
{"text":"It's 11:30am on a rainy Tuesday and I order a route 44 diet coke with limes and a medium sweet tea.  They are out of sweet tea and have to make more??  At 11:30am you've allowed yourself to run completely out of sweet tea and expect me to wait while you brew more?  What kind of planning of a lunch establishment is that??  Who's running this place?  Certainly not someone that understands how to properly stock for the lunch rush or how to make money from a fast food establishment.  So I opt for just the diet coke and to my astonishment, it's got lemons in it...  WOW.  What a ridiculous excuse for a reasonable eating establishment.  Please go out of business already so we can perhaps get a real restaurant in this prime location."}
{"text":"I am trying to avoid rating chains these days, but I felt a disturbance in the Sonic Force. As if millions of chocolate malt loving voices cried out in terror and then were suddenly silenced.

For some reason, I was craving a malt. I tried my cousin's dark chocolate malt at Steak N Shake a few days ago and it just wasn't \"malty\" enough for my taste. So I headed down to the Sonic drive-thru today and I heard five spine-tingling words. \"We no longer have malts.\"

WHAT?

I promptly put my car back in drive and left (good thing you're not sandwiched in like most drive-thrus). I wonder if this is a nationwide epidemic.

In all seriousness, Sonic does serve good food. But if they no longer do malts, that's an epic fail.

No malt = 2 stars
Food overall = 3 stars (and their shakes and slushes are still good)"}
{"text":"Sonic use to be so good. I miss the fire island burger they use to have many years ago. That was their best burger. 

This location's food was not worth the stop. Burger was dry, bacon was burned beyond belief (see pic), toast wasn't even toasted, and the tater tots were super salty. The cranberry sprite I got was good but that was the only refreshing thing I received. 

Will not go back."}
{"text":"This is the most ridiculous place I have ever seen now one knows what they are doing I ordered 3 meals and they did not have have change for a fifty I had to walk to QT for change then when I got home my order was wrong and better yet not only was it wrong it was cold I will never return to this abomination of a restaurant for the love of all thing holy stay far far away"}
{"text":"Greatest American food I have ever had in my entire life. Burgers, Chicken, Fries, Tots, Onion Rings, Corn Dogs, Hot Dogs, Ice Cream, Slushies, Breakfest and everything else they have is great."}
{"text":"When I walked in I was excited to see they went away from phone order to a counter order style.  That was until I met my Sonic Lea. She was very rude. Very short. I ordered 3 after 8 PM shake items, one without whipped cream. When delivered, the one I ordered w/o had it. I asked to have it replaced. Lea rolled her eyes and took it to the back and then came back with the same item but with the whipped cream scrapped half off. I asked for a new one and she did even a stronger eye roll went back and said \"HE WANTS A NEW ONE!\" And slammed it into the trash. Wow...
I spoke with the manager at this point. No resolution or results. I now assume this is a franchise and Lea must be a family member of the owners. If not they have no other excuse to maintain her employment.  JMO"}
{"text":"Over the past year out of approximately 50 visits to this location they got my order right and I got everything I ordered 2x. I have given up on this Sonic, the quality of the food is the worst of any sonic ever. Borderline disgusting. I don't know what the owner of this franchise is doing, but I guarantee he isn't eating there. The place is in dis-repair, don't even try the drive in spots, they are all usually broken."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!! THIS IS MY FIRST ONE STAR REVIEW I'VE EVER WRITTEN!!!! I hate complaining but I can't help BUT complain about this Sonic drive in!!!! 

To start off, I ordered food for my dad, brother, and me. I had ordered a large combo with a hamburger and onion rings for my dad and brother and a large combo with popcorn chicken and tater tots for me. I could've sworn I started growing grey hair and wrinkles waiting for the order; it took at least a good 20 minutes for them to get our order out to us. Once the order got to our car, I thanked the girl and tipped her three dollars since I did have a \"kind of big\" order. She gave us a dirty look and walked off. I can't STAND people who are inconsiderate and disrespectful!!!!

Okay...once we had the food at home, we were disappointed in what we saw and tasted!! My popcorn chicken was nothing but POPCORN BREADING!! It was horrible! I usually like everything..HHaa. Our onion rings tasted sweet and disgusting..and does it stop there? Oh no! The burgers had no quality to them. Eat AT BURGER KING IF YOU WANT THE BEST BURGERS EVER!!! 

On top of all this, I spent a total of $50 for all this!!! I'm trying to get a refund or compensation! SO, MY AWESOME YELP FRIENDS AND COOL PEOPLE WHO READ THIS REVIEW, DONT EAT AT THIS SONIC!"}
{"text":"Horrible. I keep trying every time I come here I get attitude or someone doesn't want to hand items correctly like I have germs or something. 
I came here the other day asked for waffle cone vanilla and I get a waffle cone with a line of of vanilla on 1 side of cone, I've come here like every 3 months and get waffle cone and it's always filled! If I'm paying $2 plus change I want a filled waffle cone not some cone with vanilla drizzled on wall. I love Sonics and would love to give another chance management needs to take some time  and read some these complaints , try to fix the issues so they do not happen again. I really believe this is the worse rated Sonics in the valley. The owners needs to make some changes I have no idea how they are in business after reading all these complaints. 
Sincerely a customer who use to like Sonics."}
{"text":"Half Price Shakes makes any day better; especially summer nights. 

The food is fast food fair, but the milk shakes and drink mixes are amazing. 

So swing by and ask for the cookie dough milkshake with bits of cookie dough in it. Up size it. Make it a little bigger. It costs half what it says it does."}
{"text":"Worst chicken sandwich I've ever had in my life bun was soggy chicken was waaaaay over cooked and burnt what a pathetic place to eat good bye to this place"}
{"text":"They sell the fast-food they don't seem to sell anywhere else. I like the cherry limade and the cheese fries. Also, they are fast and cheap. When you feel like out-doing McDonald's but not really, this is a good place."}
{"text":"My first Sonic experience. I have never been so sick from eating so much ice cream (Sonic Oreo Blast), woah!

It was good though. The hotdog was also awesome. I can't wait to try out more items when I come visit again."}
{"text":"Yummy! Sonic is symbolic with warm weather and roller skates (If you're lucky :))...even though I've been known to crave a lemon slush in the middle of winter. Sonic has the best variety of drinks around (non-alchoholic). Happy hour is amazing because you can get any drink or slush half off. AND...dare I say it...they have the good ice!! Hot dayum! 

On this particular trip, I was on my way home and went off the interstate 5 miles because I knew there was a Sonic in Mt. Holly! There are not enough of them in Charlotte...they are doing some funky thing with their hotdogs that I need to try...guess I have to make another trip.

I also appreciate that when you are in the drive thru and the car in front of you has different tickets, some with mayo, some without...light ice, no ice, no whip...yadda, yadda, yadda AND you only ordered an extra large Sprite...they'll bring your order out and you can pay and leave. Thank you Sonic Gods!"}
{"text":"We were sonic 1st timers and we've heard mixed reviews and decided to check it out for ourselves.  Let me tell you Sonic didn't let us down.. We got the Coney Island dogs, strawberry shakes and rootbeer floats and it was awesome!! We're trying to hit them up before we head back to Hawaii!!!"}
{"text":"Very bad customer service totally messed up my whole entire order then when I call for them to correct it to go pick up the rest of it member gets an attitude with me like if I made the order wrong I clearly can read the receipt and I'm telling him that the member got the order wrong so here's your bad yelp review I told you I was gonna write about"}
{"text":"This sonic is usually lit because it's right next to the local high school, but this summer they have consistently slacked. Giving crumbs as chicken tenders, always forgetting the sauces, and today when they gave my friend her \"French fries\" disguised as tater tots and mozzarella sticks with the absences of the mozzarella. You can complain all you'd like but be prepared to wait an eternity before your order is corrected."}
{"text":"Jasmine, as the cashier name tag says. Rude as hell , worst costumer service. And does she not know that shes supposed to give customers back their change?? Literally just walks away and doesn't say anything else."}
{"text":"dam this is the worst fuckin fast food place ive ever been to my life the slowest dam fast food place ever. .. they take so dam long just to make a drink ... been waiting like 30 minutes and only two cars ahead ... and the first on still hasnt got anything ... this is bullshit dont come here trust me ..."}
{"text":"Service was awful. I read on the websites menu they had a veggie burger. So I ordered it and they said they do not have a veggie burger. I then ordered a egg and cheese sandwich she then said \"burrito\", I said sandwich.  She looked at the screen and said all our sandwiches have meat and refused to make a simple special order like most other places."}
{"text":"First time at sonic. Husband loved his cherry limeade and I got a peanut butter fudge shake. It was good but needed a bit more mixing. Couldn't drink it until I got home and blended it more."}
{"text":"I'm digging their new hot dogs, and the BLT is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Is a fast food place, cant really say much about it
area was close to the strip and we just got off the plane and wanted something fast because we wanted to hit the casinos
so we drove to this sonic location
3 riced out miatas parked with locals having a cigs. bunch of characters so i kept an eye on them while we ate
gf ordered a regular cheese burger with tater tots
i had to finish the tots cuz she hates everything potato. not bad for tater tots
i ordered the new asiago fried chicken sandwich. didnt like the sauce that it came with because it just didnt go right with the sandwich
friend ordered a side of jalepeno poppers. the cheese was still running so that was a good sign but i wish they wouldve done something to the jalepeno because everytime i bit into one, i had to \"fight\" to bite the pepper in half
another friend ordered his favorite lemonade. i dont know what it is but he likes it
i also ordered the oreo shake. YUM!

cant complain, is fast food. havent had a sonic of a while so it was an A OK late night quick dinner

cool thing was ordering from outside through the speaker and sitting outside because it was a cool night"}
{"text":"I've had pretty bad experiences at other sonics before but this location was horrific!!!! It look 15 minutes to get my food, poor customer service. I ordered the chicken strip dinner & it came with 2 weak pieces of chicken, one onion ring& the rest of the box was full of tater tots.. it didn't even include the piece of toast that's suppose to come with it. Then my malt was not mixed well & had chunks. They also didn't give me any sauces that I asked for. I am very upset cause sonic is one of my favorite fast food restaurants and this one is right next to my house! Never going back again!"}
{"text":"Saturday night at 11pm. 45 min wait in the drive thru to get a dry crusty burger patty that oviously was pre cooked and slapped on my bun.. I ordered large to get home to medium size crap. But never charged for diffrent size so that was a good thing and the menu light was out so if you are not a regular you have no idea what they have to choose from... but hey its fast food what do you expect! Never eating there again."}
{"text":"These guys really want 15 dollars an hour ???????? They continue to mess up the order really let's be honest if they had the listening skills to work at a business or to sell products they wouldn't have to work at a job made for kids. That's why they have these jobs.....  also if I wanted to pull up and wait for my food I would have gone to a stall to order."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the experience I had tonight. I come here often and happened to be driving by with a car full of people. It was 11:55 PM, was not sure if they were open, but the OPEN neon sign was on. As I was turning in off the road, saw a car at the drive thru ordering. Two very good signs they were open. And yes we verified the time on our cellphones.

Pulled up to the speaker and was refused service because the computer locks at midnight. I've worked a POS system before and it does not refuse service especially when it wasn't even midnight yet. When questioned, the employee was incredible rude to us. But of course the car in front of us got service.

Extremely disappointed. Lesson: don't go here after 11 PM there computers might be \"locked\". I will not be bringing my business back here."}
{"text":"As a huge sonic fan this is by far the worst sonic I have ever been to. The service, seeing as how there wasn't many people there (wonder why), was slow. The credit card machine in my parking spot was broken. When I told the car hop she did not really seem to care. Once I got back home, which was across the street, my food was cold and very sloppily put together. I had a chili dog. Nothing crazy. The staple of sonic drive ins. By reading the other reviews, poor decision hindsight, this place is in desperate need of some new management."}
{"text":"Being a Hawaii resident, Sonics has always been a \"must visit\" in the mainland. I was quite disappointed to say the least. In commercials you see the waitress' coming in roller skates delivering your food. Nope! They just came out walking and I mean that's not the reason I gave this place a 2 star. The food was not \"wooooww\" the way it seems on commercials. I'm from Hawaii's and we can whip up a chili hot dog like nothing. Maybe I'll need to try more of their food. But for now, it's not a \"wow I need to try this place\" type food."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY slow service every single time I come here ! Do not come here if you don't wanna spend 30 mins waiting for one milkshake."}
{"text":"If you don't already know they stop selling pineapple . I don't know when or why but that's real crappy.  And that iconic picture of the delicious banana split disappeared from the menu. Giving it one star because they Took away my favorite pineapple milkshake. Can I get a moment of silence"}
{"text":"Alrighty Sonic..... I have given you a few chances, because all of the other Sonics I go to I am pretty happy with. When its lunch time and I want something quick and easy you are usually one of my choices! This Sonic happens to be not too far from my work and home, but I will no longer be visiting..... I will drive out of my way to spend my money somewhere else. Not only have I gone here 3 times and been un happy with the food, the service...... is beyond ridiculous. Most Sonics are employed with younger high school kids...... lets get them to get their acts together specifically at this location. Each of my visits has ended with awful customer service, or just plain bad food. This last visit was the last straw for me! Throwing food out through the drive though window is unprofessional and rude, being rude and a smart patooty (yes I just said patooty) is also not appreciated and frankly absurd since your job at the drive through is customer service!!! These kids should be happy to have a job at all in this economy. After experiencing that I get to work to eat my food and..... YUCK is all I can say! The foot long chili cheese coney I received was inedible, I attached a wonderful picture of me picking through the hot dog as for the whole thing looked like this.... decide for yourself if you would eat it.

Needless to say I am pretty hangry and cant wait to get off work and enjoy fast food from any where else but Sonic."}
{"text":"For a change of pace, we stopped at a Sonic rather than, well, any other fast food place.  I don't usually think of Sonic when I think fast food, so it wasn't an entirely bad choice, because I like variety - even if it is of the fast food kind.  What's more is that Sonic has breakfast, and I'm a big fan of breakfast.

Unfortunately, they don't do it well.

While the staff is very friendly in the drive-in format (missing only the roller skates), they are probably one of the worst for putting up a picture of something on the menu board and then delivering something that looks about as far from that item as possible.

I ordered a breakfast burrito of some kind and what I got looked nothing at all like what was on the board.  It had all the ingredients, but there is no way what I received could ever have been made to look like what was on the menu board.

It might have tasted the same, but it looked like slop.  Very disappointing indeed."}
{"text":"Sonic is a good standby when you want fast food but want something a bit different - we rarely eat there, so it's an interesting change. Sure, there are burgers and fries, but they always seem to have something different on the menu as well (plus they serve breakfast all day - something those other guys aren't doing at this point, unless you're stopping at Jack in the Box).

Now if only what they brought out looked like what was on the menu - but that's not unique to Sonic or anything."}
{"text":"The drive-in is typically a fun place for an afternoon snack. We must have hit a shift change or something when we went. I took my son and his pregnant wife to shut down the cravings. Sadly, we waited more than an hour for anything to get delivered! I finally called and asked if they had forgotten us and they brought food about five minutes later. Nothing was hot or fresh."}
{"text":"Only gave this place one star because I had to. They charge you for water and then act like you're stupid when you're surprised that you have to pay 2 dollars to get water. I asked for water and then noticed that they charged for it, so I asked and the girl that roller blades around laughed and said \"uh yeah we charge for water.\" 

If I wouldn't have payed already I would've left."}
{"text":"I don't normally frequent sonic but it's nice to know that they're open 24/7 and that they're down the street from my house. Sonic has so many different things on their menu, it's a little overwhelming lol. 

I usually order the chicken sandwich and the tots (with cheese, jalapeños, and onions). The chicken sandwich is a little dry but the chicken tastes pretty good. The tots are my fave though. I really wish they gave the option of grilling the onions though... that would be so bombbbb. Its a pretty big order so im usually full by the end of my meal. I haven't tried much on the menu but I really should the next time I come here. 

Service is eh. The drive thru is always slow and backed up. I used to work at a fast food place so I'm pretty sure they have some kind of time to beat... and they never beat that lol anyway, this place is decent!"}
{"text":"I have a love / hate relationship with Sonic, in particular this location in Henderson. 
On the plus side, it's open late (but not 24 hours), and service for the most part is fast and friendly. And sometimes you get the skating car hops which adds to the experience. 

Dislikes: Kinda quirky to get in and out of off Boulder Highway. And their payment systems won't let you put the tip for the car hops on your card. You gotta pay them cash. And sometimes they get slammed so if you have little patience in the evenings this is not the place for you. And one another annoyance is people that don't turn their headlights off while parked so you can get dazzled while eating your food sometimes....

But nobody does drinks, shakes, floats, etc like Sonic...they don't even come close. A Route 44 Cherry Limeade, extra real cherries, easy ice hits the spot when few other things will on a scorching hot day."}
{"text":"Bad service, manager on duty was rude,orders came incomplete and shortage on all toppings!!!"}
{"text":"During my time living in Maryland I've seen a good deal of Sonic commercials on the tele.  Being that I have never seen a Sonic, I was perplexed by these commercials.  So, using the power of the internets I discovered that there weren't any Sonics in the state of Maryland.

When I moved to my new home of San Diego, I was confronted by the Sonic commercials yet again.  I internet-searched again and found the nearest Sonic was about 2 hours away.  My perplexion flexed into downright dismay.  Commercials are expensive endeavors--so why would a company essentially throw their money away by advertising whereever they are not located?

One night, my friend Jen picked me up at the Phoenix Airport for a nice hangout weekend.  We were both really hungry and deciding where to nosh.  When out of the corner of my right eye i spy a garish forty-one hundred kelvin fluorescent beacon in the night.  I thought it was some sort of carwash or super-sized gasstation at first glance.  Jen explained that was a Sonic.  \"What the fvck's a Sonic?\" I replied.  To this point I have never seen a Soinic before in the flesh or in the disgusting eyesore of a prefab materials and light, as it were.  So it was decided right then and there that we would eat this Sonic.

Now, I know I cannot speak for all the distant Sonics in parts of the world a young hooligan such as myself has never been to, but to this, my virgin Sonicage, I can.

There is a huge slab of concrete which seemed way too large for the size of the building.  On this slab was lots of parking spots under a handfull of overhangs shining enough fluorescent light to make a operating room mildly jealous. Beside each of the parking spots was a lit-up menu with fast-food type stuffs, drinks, slushies, smoothies, ice cream sundaes, banana splits, etc.  As if this wasn't enough, they also have a drive-thru.  Again my perplexion returned.

The awful shine of it all, the harshness on weary eyes... It is a monument to decadence to the point of bloatation and bloatiosity.

While we were deciding what we wanted a Mexican family rolled up beside us with a roller-skated jalopy and young children in the back.  They ordered and pulled away blasting some thuggish gangsta rap as their trunk buzzed with whorish flapping sheetmetal not sealed or sealed or sealed.

Jen ordered blackberry iced tea and some fried mac n' cheese bites, I, the tater-tots with cheese and a cranberry limeade. We pulled away blasting while our thuggish gangsta rap as our trunk rattled and flapped whoreishly--waves dissipating into the must of chaparral, waves lifting into the witheringchaped desert night.

Got home and ate in normal lighting--Lighting that didn't make one's flesh crawl rutty-riddled with hungover insomniacian interrogation prior to a privilege afforded to be actually hungover.

The drinks were surprisingly not overly sweet and made with lots of that pellet style-ice that we so heart in drinks like these.  The iced tea was quality and the crisp tartness of my cranberry limeade (with actual half of a real lime floating in it) was perfectly refreshing.  The mac n' cheese thingees tasted like a crispy fried stouffers mac n' cheese.  Sadly, these are a limited time only option. As for my tater-tots with cheese, eh, not so good.  They were just bland cafeteria-style tots with a slice of American cheese thrown ontop--A wrinkly transparent orangish shellac coalescing my tots into a gelatinous choir.

...and that was and is how I met a Sonic."}
{"text":"I love Sonic, but this is my least favorite location in the valley. I don't know if they're always understaffed, but I always wait forever, no matter what time of day it is, and my order is messed up at least every other time. Super frustrating when you're pregnant and craving something specific & don't wanna wait for a long time AGAIN to get it fixed."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick treat - looking for something different.  We don't frequent Sonic so seeing the shakes delivered by a roller skating waitress was a treat for the kids. The service was friendly but the shakes weren't anything special, I must say.  Of the five we got (Strawberry, Vanilla, Caramel, Cheesecake, and a Cookie Dough blast), two family members thought they were really good and the other three wouldn't be anxious to return."}
{"text":"This Sonic Drive In is just outside the strip but despite averaging only three stars on Yelp, I think it is one of the better Sonic Drive-Ins simply because their employees are incredible in terms of service, courtesy, and promptness. I couldn't believe how they bend over backwards to zoom out on roller skates and get you your order quickly or provide you with refills, etc. I mean, granted the food isn't all that great, but their service was way better than what I experienced at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon! 

Tip: 1/2 price shakes after 8pm"}
{"text":"Went to Sonic and got number 11 of chicken tenders with tots/ one onion ring and one toast and I found that my chicken was not cooked at all! Very disappointed, will be calling and complaining about it ."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this place opened. I hadn't seen a sonic in years because I had moved out of their area. This place was great for the first few weeks or months. But after that it seems to be sliding off a cliff. Every order is always wrong, missing items every single time. Food is hit or miss if it will be hot. It seems to be run by a bunch of kids with no adults ever to help or check on things. It's right across from a \"Club\" and sometimes the people coming from there are not family friendly. 

I always go hoping that the next time will be better, and always come away disappointed from this location."}
{"text":"Quick service. Important for when it's 116 degrees and you need that slush during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. There are very few restaurants near by so It's disappointing how terrible the service is. The place is dirty and SUPER SLOW and the employees literally don't listen. I have them repeat my order and they always repeat something way off (random azz shakes) When I go I always get a Reese's blast and my bf gets a waffle berry blast but somehow they can never get it right. Also they are always laughing and not fully attentive WHILE ordering. Ive called a few times to complain only to be told that I would be contacted back within a day (never hear anything)."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times over the years dating back to high school. I used to come for the food (Texas toast sandwiches, tater tots, and breakfast burritos were most notable), but I only recently started re-visiting for their slushes. 

A friend of mine suggested coming here during one particularly hot day a couple summers ago. It was Happy Hour (2-5pm) and that meant drinks and slushes were 1/2 off. I followed his lead and ordered a medium Real Fruit Strawberry and Lime Slush - I was hooked! I believe the medium is 16 oz and it was only $1 and some change! The only variation I've gotten is Strawberry with Pineapple, but I'm stuck on the real fruit. It's really delicious (albeit sweet) and I highly recommend it! Also, the large size is HUGE and only 40 cents more - definitely something to share.

Service has always been pleasant. I primarily utilize the drive-thru and have used the drive-up a couple times. Also, there's never a long wait."}
{"text":"Sonic is usually a great fast food establishment, however this location falls a little short for me. Most specifically I drove through today for just a drink. Little did I know that this location is boxed in unlike any other I've been to before. So, I was stuck waiting at the drive in for about 10 minutes while the car in front of me had their large order filled sitting there with my drink stuck unable to leave. I regret choosing this location to quench my thirst because it was a sandtrap for my time."}
{"text":"Disappointing. We ordered two American dogs, a foot long coney dog and a regular NY dog. We asked to substitute the chili for onions and sour kraut on a foot long Coney dog. They said no. Really? I was quite surprised and a bit disappointed. When we paid there was a bit of attitude. No sorry we could substitute, no thanks for you business. To top it off the food was boring. Next time I will go to a hotdog cart.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Been here many times, its close to home,  n I've never had any issues at all. The food is great, the service is awesome. I like getting down n eating instead of sittin in the car n eating. Today I went n my only complaint is the amount of mosquitoes that were everywhere by the tables but I guess that's everwhere this time of year."}
{"text":"This is place is SO SLOW. There's nothing quick about it. Expect to wait for your little meal for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Ok... I have to admit; this is my guilty pleasure. I HATE how living in San Diego... and San Jose... and normal large metropolitan cities; we get these annoying Sonic ads on TV. Guess what!? THERE ARE NO SONICS AROUND ME!!! At least within a normal driving distance! (And I'm the gal who grew up driving to Napa for lunch! SHEESH!)

We definitely gorged ourselves silly here... And they have a \"Happy Hour\" from 2-4; where the drinks were 50% off. The bacon cheeseburger had amazingly crisp yummy bacon. The corndog gave Hot Dog on a Stick a run for its money and the service was surprisingly fast compared to the Orange, CA location. Ahhh.... and their glorious drinks. Shakes were divine and the cream slushes were perfect."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I've moved to Henderson which is back in 2001. It's always busy when I come here and staff is usually very nice. They're on top of their game when I come here and food comes to your car quickly. One thing I wish they continued to do was have the workers roll around in roller blades. It would bring out the 50's theme!"}
{"text":"Still waiting on my food after 20 mins of ordering! Slow and ppl standing there talking!"}
{"text":"This location of sonic suck!! The employees are a joke. You get served stale cold food that you wait over 29 minutes for!!! The car hop was a complete freaking idiot!!! I will never ever go to this location again!! Worst fast food experience ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Just spent 10 min in the drive thur to get a 4 piece mozzarella stick to receive it cold and frozen still in the middle !!! What a waste of money and Time !"}
{"text":"UPDATE:

I originally gave this Sonic a 5 star rating b/c the first couple of times I went there, it was amazing.  Well, this last time was NOT.
We went through the drive thru, ordered 2 breakfast burritos with NO PEPPERS and NO JALAPENOS.  Well, the first time, the order was wrong, it had peppers.  The second time, the order was wrong, it had no peppers, but it had jalapenos.  The third time, the girl at the window spilled my soda ALL OVER MY LAP cuz the lid wasn't on tight.  
At this point, the manager decided to give me my meal for free.  YOU THINK???  Guess, I can't ask for much from min-wagers, and yeah, even my free meal wasn't right.  It still had jalapenos.  I threw it in the trash.

UGH, go to the one on Sahara.  Stay clear of this one!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the worst sonic, by far. Every single time we go in something on our order is wrong. Tonight, I went through the drive through after work and ordered a chicken sandwich with hatch green chilies and cheese, 2 chocolate cream pie shakes with extra graham, tater tots and a mini chocolate shame. The guy repeats my order as a hatch green chili cheese burger and nothing else. I repeat what I would like 3 more times before he finally gets it all. I proceed to the window and wait 10 mins before even being acknowledge. He gives me my food and I check, sure enough there is no cheese. I tell him that only to be handed a tray with a piece of cheese and decide at this point to leave, since I'm not a big fan of eating other people's spit. I get home to discover there is no graham crackers at all in our shakes. This place is a freaking joke. Sonic corporation needs to send some people in there and do a serious clean up of the staff. The one off of Ray and Almaschool is much better."}
{"text":"This particular sonic restaurant is located right outside of the country club where I live I do not like fast food but my Lord they have got this amazing crazy vanilla blizzard with peanut butter cups and I always used to go and get a small one with no whip cream
It was the best this one is not open 24 hours but the location is awesome so I need time that you need to go get your car washed there is one right there in walking distance it's the best I don't like the fast food but they do have a grilled chicken sandwich which is pretty awesome one time I flipped out because I told this lady not to put mayonnaise on it and she did it 
I had had one of those nights the night prior and I just wanted something to eat really quick to sop up whatever was going on inside me I literally went inside and was like what the Heck 

All the employees here really nice kind of feel bad for the girl on rollerskates though that's got to suck
Always give your girl a couple of bucks don't be cheap. 
But I've never seen it busy 
In 5 years- seriously"}
{"text":"One time, they gave me an extra order of tots for free it was lit. They also gave me a bigger order of something on accident, but i'm not complaining about it. Their servers are nice so I always tip them when I can."}
{"text":"I hadn't had much trouble from Sonic before, but the food today was awful. I had a craving for chili cheese fries and when I got the bag they had put the container sideways so it was basically upside down. On them they put the dregs of the chili sauce that was so salty it was awful. And it was microwaved! The interior of the mess was molten lava hot and the fries were dried out from microwaving. Total lack of caring. It was gross."}
{"text":"Ive been to this Sonic multiple times, and ive never been happy with it, I dont even know why I still bother to come.. The food is fine but when you go expect everything to be WRONG! There is a man and a women there, I didnt catch her name but his name is RODOLFO, She has dark hair, always wears some type of lipstick, looks like she is going for the \"rockabilly\" look, and heavy set. They are both incredibly rude and take the order wrong and quick with an attitude every single time. I will not be returning to this location. Completely discouraged."}
{"text":"Was blown away when I discovered they charged for water. So many businesses are coming up with these silly charges that sour the experience for the consumer...will have to think long and hard before returing"}
{"text":"I love the food but y'all overnight staff really need to watch their mouth. They will mess up on your order even though they should've gotten it right the first time and they will let it be known that I guess it's \"your fault\". Like y'all don't get paid enough to talk to people the way y'all do overnight. Y'all are in a fast food restaurant with the easiest shit to remake. Y'all lazy, y'all need to learn manners, and just correct it who cares who messed up. When y'all applied for this job y'all should've known what working in fast food is all about. That shit is going to happen everyday if it's a problem quit. Y'all barely make enough to support y'all household to be in the window saying some rude shit and you know that's probably why y'all mad. I will never eat at sonic again. This will be up on every review bored I find."}
{"text":"Let me start off with, I usually love Sonic. Tonight they really let me down! My best friend was in town and looking for some good fast food so we decided on Sonic. We got there and the man behind the window was great but when we got our orders we were very disappointed. I'm allergic to tomatoes and I hate lettuce so I asked for both to be removed from my sandwich and my best friends sandwich was drier than the Sahara. I expect so much more from you Sonic! You really let us down today!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited first but from my first bite I thought 
I'm eating McDonald's , price way over priced 
for this kind of  quality burgers.So far  In n Out  the best burger so far within fast food industry"}
{"text":"This place sucks!! 11:58pm I guess staff is joking and fulling around and not even paying attention to there work because they made us wait 40min for the order and when they finally answer the guy said wait!.....fuck that! Drive through might might might be descent but definitely not recommend coming to this location........."}
{"text":"Sitting in the drive thru watching the night crew screw around for 15 mins doesn't sit well with me. I know it's just sonic, but chain places live and die with customer service. 

One of the worst late night fast food places in my neighborhood it seems. Every time I go to Cane's late night the service is amazing. I'll keep going there from now on.

Someone took my order 15 mins ago and I'm still sitting in my car waiting for someone to acknowledge me...
But at least the guy in the window can slide along the kitchen floor....he's pretty excited about it."}
{"text":"The sonic is a pretty good location to come to. Thumbs up for being open late night and having easy access. 

However, the last few times I have gotten a Coney dog, it seems almost uncooked and a bit cold. Also, Sonic apparently charges for a small water when you buy food now. I was not made aware of this when I ordered, but the cashier informed me it is/was a recent change. 

Otherwise, this is a 4/5-Star joint."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times and had similar 1 star experiences each time.  The wait times for the drive thru is absolutely ridiculous! I was waiting to order at the speaker for about 4 minutes before someone acknowledged my presence and I drove up knowing what I wanted so I didn't need to browse the menu. My total experience was 17 minutes today and at 10:30PM it was not very busy, only a few cars in front of me.  Today was 79 cent medium slush day and I asked for a blue raspberry lime and the person who took my order did not inform me that the extra flavor would cost 30 cents extra.  The end result tasted like NyQuil liquid medicine and was nasty. Two sips and straight to the trash.  Guess I'll go back to Hot Dog on A Stick for quality flavored drinks. I also ordered a grilled cheese and a small order of tots well done. The grilled cheese was yummy per usual but the tots were way too greasy and they didn't give me ketchup after I specifically asked for some.  I won't be back at Sonic for awhile and certainly not this location."}
{"text":"Service is so slow. We got into the line about 6 cars deep at 9:48pm to get a cup of ice and a DP and we didn't get our drinks until 10:09pm. There was no hustle in their staff."}
{"text":"imagine eating
a hairball your cat yakked up
that would be sonic


The quality is that of prison food. The flavor is that of a Flint Michigan public school cafeteria, complete with local water.  
I don't think I ever tasted anything as horrible as Sonic food. Possibly, it is made of racoon poop. One bite and into the trash.

Carry on."}
{"text":"Absolutely floored by the service we received tonight at this this sonic. We pulled into one of the drive in parking spaces to simply order ice cream and two of them are broken so we then pull into the drive thru. We waited over 20 minutes just to get to the window, as we were the patient customers and watched 5 other cars drive off before even reaching the window. When we get to the window, we are told \"I don't know what to tell you\" and that our ice cream isn't ready and they don't know when it'll be ready. We then questioned why we would have to pay for waiting so long for ICE CREAM and we were told that we would be stealing if she didn't charge us. This young lady was rude and clearly incompetent and hopefully she finds another job that isn't in the service industry."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and totally agree with the 1-2 star people rate this place. My last visit I sat in the drive thru for 5-10 minutes with no response from anyone inside. I decided to pull up and go in. I found one couple talking to someone figuring their order out and then the person vanished. I could see 3 other staff members away from the front just talking...a few minutes passed and then someone finally came up front but they noticed some friends standing near the counter and chatted with them for a few minutes. I was done waiting, I left, never spoke to anyone. I would say all up I was there for 15-20 mins with no help. It wasn't late, 7:30pm. I would skip it and find something else, you'll be done before anyone here would even help you."}
{"text":"Now I understand why in the commercials the two guys are always in their cars... (We don't have Sonics in Hawaii). Anyways, my family and I had already eaten lunch so we were full, but my sister really wanted a limeade. So we set off to Sonic and I got my very first limeade (strawberry). My sister and Dad got Cherry limeades. It was delicious and a perfect way to wash down lunch. I loved that there were chunks of strawberries in there as well!

Maybe next time I'll actually order food food..."}
{"text":"Omg! Talk about SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW.... This place takes 15 mins or more in the drive thru:/ I keep trying to give it chances since it's the closest to my house, but time after time you have to wait sooooooooooo long. Not cool!"}
{"text":"Takes forever and they'll usually forgot at least one thing you ordered. I wouldn't order anything except a milkshake from this place. The food is garbage."}
{"text":"My friend I stopped at this place for a drink and a quick bite to eat, before we went tire shopping. We ordered 2 Large Slushes, a chicken sandwich, 2 corn dogs and a medium chili cheese tot.

I ate the chicken sandwich, but the chicken strips were stale. The sandwich was poor quality, even for a fast food joint. It was terribly made. It had a terrible taste too.

The corn dogs and Slushes were normal. Nothing to report there.

The chili cheese tot, however, was not normal. After I found a fork in my car, because they didn't include one in my bag, I took a couple bites of the tots. I noticed, maybe after the third bite, there was something gray on top of the chili. It looked to be an ashes from a cigarette or mold even. I was so disgusted!

I called the restaurant back and asked for the manager. The lady that answered identified herself as the manager. I said, \"I just pulled off. I ordered the Chili Cheese Tot and the other stuff. As I was eating the tots, I noticed mold or something gray on my tots.\" The lady response was, \"Oh ok! Just come back in and bring your receipt and we'll give you another one or your money back. You can pull through the drive thru or car hop.\" 

That was it. She showed no empathy, no emotion, no anything.
I did expect her to beg for my forgiveness or offer me free food for a year, or anything. I just wanted her to say something to let me know that the quality of food she's serving, matters to her. She could have even pretended to care about my health or well being. But nope, she didn't.

I took the tots back after about 1 hour because I was busy. I pulled to the window and told them what happened and again, no empathy. I passed the tots through the window and lady came back and asked for the receipt. She noticed I had paid with a gift card. She made a big deal about refunding my money, because I told her it would freeze my card if she issues a refund.

She told me I could contact the Area manager but there was no way for her to give me my money back. I was pissed. We had a few words and she ended up giving me 2 coupons for $2 off on food (coupon can be used at other locations). I told her that I was never coming back and she was like, Ok! Have a good day.

I'm pissed because I just lost my Drink Stop but oh well. I'm sure there's other places around. I added this place to my \"Never Again\" List."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience at this location in all the  years coming here...brown bag special w slushee never fails baby!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband went there for a SIMPLE order... and tried and tried to explain to the cashier what we wanted about 5 times she still messed it up... ugh!! No bueno!"}
{"text":"VERY slow service!! Went around 9pm and the drive thru line wasn't too long. However, I waited longer than I would at an In n Out, which would have twice the amount of cars in the drive thru!

Luckily, I had time to kill. Gave an extra star because I like their drinks and the lady at the window was nice. But man oh man, avoid this location. Another helper put it right when they said \"the slowest fast food service.\""}
{"text":"The wait is really long during happy hour from 2pm - 4pm.   We waited over 30 mins.  But the girl was very friendly and ice. You can see from the pictures there is a long line on their drive-thru. But the prices are great for a quick drink and snack."}
{"text":"Ordered a strawberry slush, watermelon slush, cherry slush, and coke slush. Sounds fairly simple, right? Instead, they forgot the watermelon slush and brought out a piña colada slush instead of the coke slush. The girl at the drive-thru was rude when we pointed out the obvious mistake with the piña colada slush and claimed my white colored slush was \"definitely\" coke. I don't think so. We pulled ahead to wait for the watermelon slush and received a cherry slush. Ugh. When I asked to have my coke slush corrected, the car hop ignored me and hurried away. What kind of customer service is this? Won't be going there again."}
{"text":"This sonic needs to get it together. 75% of the stalls have been out of order for 3 weeks. Plus every time we come we wait 5 minutes after pressing the button to even get someone to place an order."}
{"text":"Much better service than the Sonics I'm accustomed to (Vegas mostly), the food, not so much. Of course I can't complain, coming from So Cal, where there's one Sonic (in Anaheim) to serve a 100 mile radius, it's kind of a destination there. Here I'm spoiled. LOL"}
{"text":"Not just the worst Sonic, but the worst fast food restaurant I have ever been to. READ BELOW

I get off work later so I only go because it's the closest and most convenient. Every single time I go I keep telling myself there is no way these guys can do me wrong this many times and I'm going to have a normal experience this time, buut nope. I'm wrong every time. 
Just in the past month this is what's happened: 
Twice I have pulled up in the drive thru and nobody answers, I can see them in there horsing around and I have waited up to 5 minutes, pulling back and forth and even honked my horn, both times the kids in the window saw me and laughed, still didn't answer. No they were not closed, it was 10:30pm. So I sped off and went to trusty In-N-Out.
When they do answer, my order is either completely wrong and ALWAYS cold and stale; it's no question the food I was given has been sitting out for hours, not even a hint warmth in any of it.
My poor dad had all of my family over last week, ordered about 15 meals for all of us and when he got home we discovered there was 6 burgers missing and what we did have was not at all what we ordered. My old man calls this place to simply get some answers and the kid who answered was rude and told my dad he was busy and would call back. Of course he never did so once again trusty In-N-Out Burger came through.
Last night I stopped by after work, once again telling myself \"there's no way I can have this bad of luck, this is going to go fine\" I ordered three junior burgers, I made it very clear that I wanted no mayo on them and the guy talking to me was pretty rude about it too. When I got to the window, the girl repeated my order, she told me only one has no mayo, and I corrected her and said all three don't. Right when I said that either the order taker or the cook screams \"YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID ALL THREE GOD DAMNIT!\" I lifted my head up to see some scummy looking kid in the background glaring at me. The girl at the window quickly shut the window and went back to talk to him, she came back and gave me a bag, I could here that kid still yelling something when she gave it to me. 
Keep in mind everytime I have gone here I've always been really nice to these guys hoping they would do a good job on my food, so it's not like im being rude and picky.

After tonight it was my last straw with this place and I called corporate and the district manager.

Unfortunately I have heard even worse stories than mine from neighbors but the trendiest complaint I have heard from them is cold food, wrong orders and no answers at the drive thru.

Listen guys, don't go to this place until you see a sign that says \"NEW STAFF\" or something because these kids are useless. Trained monkeys could do better, honestly.
This is the first and only complaint I have ever had about any restaurant and the first AND ONLY time I will ever blog about it. Keep that in mind"}
{"text":"Food was cold/old, and we had to ask for condiments. A real disappointment to say the least

Edit- only thing eaten today and now I have food poisoning....thanks for nothing"}
{"text":"Usually it's a long wait but we go when every one wants a mid night snack. I usually don't complain about terrible service from fast food. But I get an unusual amount of cold food from this location. Tonight I got a master blast with pieces of styrofoam in it. Definitely not pleasing. Taking a break for a bit. My gut will probably be happy."}
{"text":"Pretty normal place for fast food and doesn't stand out. Sometimes went for a milkshake. Just feel the way they order and take the food out to your car is pretty interesting"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have not been a fan of Sonic. Food is mediocre to lousy at best. Portions are small and everything is over priced. I am also not a fan of the drive-in order from a board as they use.  It almost seems like a bad version of the 50's drive in diner. If the waiter/waitress came out in person for the order it would be different. I'm just not much of a fan.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Went to Sonics for lunch. I got a footlong 2 small fries and a Chicago dog. My footlong wasn't a got though which wasn't cool. I want a refund"}
{"text":"First time visiting a sonic....my kids aswell so they insisted we try it.we ordered through the sign menu.the service was fair being there was about 10 cars and only seen 1 server on skates is how he got around which was cool.food was good I tried there chili cheese tater tots a carmel brownie blast and a mini chili cheese dog,and had to try there slushy with nerds.food   was a 4 out of 5 restroom was a disaster that's why I gave it 4 stars.i would return to eat here again if I wanted this kind of food."}
{"text":"Sonic is always amazing. 2-5 PM is happy hour for drinks and slushees! Blue coconut slush is amazing  all the food is good. Tater tots, chicken everything!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why we keep giving this location chance after chance but we really like their drinks. It's not that we go at busy times but the drive through is ALWAYS SLOW. Tonight's adventure proved a 10 minute wait for ONE drink order and we were the ONLY car in line at 8:30 on a Saturday night. Sadly this is the norm. Would love to try their food (not really) but if pouring a drink is a challenge, I don't want to see the wait from the grill. Not sure how this location stays in business."}
{"text":"Husband stopped here on way home from work and got home with a completely different order than what he ordered. Not only that, we had to drive back and get the correct order. Hubby called and spoke with the manager Victoria and she immediately apologized and when we got there she was very sympathetic and apologetic. She was so sincere to us and even gave us a free cone for our daughter. Victoria, thank you for being a sincere manager and fixing those issues. There needs to be more Victoria's in the food industry. Thanks again Victoria!"}
{"text":"Very slow service anytime of day. Orders are so wring alot.seems like they are worried about people at car parking then Drive thru"}
{"text":"Love the slushies food not so much, the chili dogs used to be great , now the banana strawberry shake bomb. You could never go wrong for happy hour"}
{"text":"I highly discourage this Sonic if you like your order right or any kind of customer service. 

My order has been significantly wrong 3 out of the last four times I have went thru the sonic drive thru. 
Tonight I repeated my ridiculously easy order 3x at the order speaker & checked with the window employee twice while receiving our order. Which in turn she acted like I was the stupid one...

GET IT TOGETHER SONIC, BEFORE YOUR INCOMPETENCE ENDS YOU! 

smh"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff!!


We went late at night and some anonymous employee just gave us our drink because of the long wait and our small order of a cherry limeade.


I like the snacks they have but make sure you ask for marinara and any extra side because drive thru doesn't put a courtesy one in there for ya.

prettty good for a late night snack plus its in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I give it only one star just because the fact that they ar also I don't think it's a good thing but since they're open late homeless people hang out at the dining tables where customers are supposed to sit down and enjoy their meal with their families without being approached by homeless people sitting at the table with them asking them for The manager Felicia said that if a homeless person came down and sat there next to our family and ate our food it's our problem we asked him to leave for times and leave us alone I contacted an employee at the sonic ask them to bring to attention of the management I never offered a refund or replacement of our food also said it's our problem it is not the problem of sonic"}
{"text":"will not return because management will not accept certain coupons! and he was very rude! you'll know who he is, hes very big."}
{"text":"I love this location! Always great service and fast. I know if I am in a hurry I can get in and out quickly. I also love to get the great bags of sonic ice...it's the best!"}
{"text":"I went to this location after work last Friday and I wish I didn't. 
The food came out and while I ate it, I knew there was something off but, I was starving and ate it anyways.. I had the chicken strip basket (Spicy) and the fries were cold and the chicken was a light grey color. I also had an oreo blast that looked as if there was half an oreo mixed in and I basically had a vanilla shake with a spoon.

Well, about 20 minutes later I get home and I am violently ill until about 3am the next morning, It was absolutely terrible. I got food poisoning from this place and three days later I still feel ill. I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Sonics? across from the palms? Not bad. Happy hour for their drinks and slushy from 2pm-4pm."}
{"text":"I will never come to this sonic again. I ordered the number 11. The chicken box with onion RINGS and Texas toast. I got 1 onion ring and a piece of untoasted white bread. Manager \"Devon\" was unwilling to do anything or help. He said and I quote \"the meal only comes with one onion ring\". You have got to be kidding. On top of that when he answered the phone he said \"hello?\"  No name, no nothing. I understand That it is a low-paying job, but how about giving a shit.  To top it all off, the entire box is ice cold. I mean ice cold. Not even moderately warm. And I still waited in the drive-through for five minutes while the employees flirted with each other through the drive-through window. You have lost my business and hopefully the rest of Mayfield Heights' business. So unprofessional."}
{"text":"Loved the food hate the wait. If it wasn't so hot I probably would have given an extra star! Lol"}
{"text":"Ordered a burger with no onion lettuce and tomato and you can tell they unwrapped an old burger took the toppings off and brought it out. There is still lettuce they didn't get off on it. The French fries were as hard as rock and as cold as ice. I wish I wouldn't have driven away I would have insisted on getting my money back and went to Wendy's right up the street. This was intentional not an accident it's obvious."}
{"text":"I love sonic, especially for a late night snack! My only problem is they took off the chicken club from the menu, that was the best thing on there! Their hotdogs are amazing! Get the chicken club back on the menu and you have 5 stars. Thanks"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this sonic isn't even worth reviewing about. All bad :/ wrong order. And rude employees."}
{"text":"The strawberry limeade is so refreshing. Chicago dog on a poppy seed bun is my favorite.  
Roller skate service is fun too.
My son loves the Chicken Strip and Real Ice Cream Shakes"}
{"text":"Shake machine down AGAIN, chicken sandwich would take 8 minutes!  This place always has issues will never come back."}
{"text":"This location was aweful. The employees dont wash their hands after using the restrooms. Other kitchen employees were eating while preping our order. The manager was appologetic but was inexperienced and unable to refund my meals while we were there. If you can avoid at all cost. Arbys down the street is a much better choice."}
{"text":"DRIVE THRU SERVICE IS ABSOLUTELY RUDE. Put on hold multiple times and the lady was sassy and rude when we did speak with her. Very displeased with the service and the way the workers speak to there customers. I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Came here needing something to drink on a budget.

Got a large cranberry lime-ade for $1.05 since it was before 10 am.

At this location, you can pay with your card outside of the drive-thru window even before you see the cashier.

I drove up, paid, and got my cheap and refeshing drink in less than a couple of minutes."}
{"text":"I came here after it was suggested to me to get the chili cheese tater tots during a random food conversation with some buddies of mine. It was pretty good, crunchy tater tots even though they had chili slathered on them. The chili was only okay, but the cheddar over everything helped bring it all together.

I also got a cranberry limeade that was tart and refreshing as always, some onion rings that had a sweet batter for whatever reason, and a double bacon cheeseburger that was the highlight of my late night purchase.

It was Sonic, I went in knowing what I was going to get, and I wasn't disappointed. I might even replace the onion rings I normally get with the chili cheese tots for future visits."}
{"text":"The quality of service is HORRIBLE at this sonic! We went there for 2 small sonic blasts and were at the window for 23 minutes! The kids working were messing around and not even attempting to get our order done. The kid Ali finally gave us our order, he turn and said \"are we cool?\" I'm sorry but what happened to \"Have a nice evening!\" That is the most unprofessional comment you could ever make. I won't be going back to this sonic again! There needs to be better management or these kids need to be taught respect!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them a zero. I come through the drive through I place my order. I was in the drive through for 20 min for them to get my order wrong and over charge me."}
{"text":"Just as delicious as I remember it. They got our order correct and it was hot and delicious still when we got home. Haven't been to this Sonic since I lived in Arizona, good to see that it still has quality food and excellent service. Carhop had big smile throughout the whole delivery of our food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Man I used to love Sonic, but they are definitely going down the drain. Longer wait Times, food seems to be getting worse, and what happened to the skates?

Been to Sonics all over the US, and as a whole, this company is losing it. Still decent grease food, but just not as awesome as it used to be."}
{"text":"It's okay, I had food and waned Chicken tenders and well they had them with sauce, I think I got BBQ and well it was okay and small, I got tater tots, that be wow salty and well they say all orders of food at that place comes with tater tots and well, being that they found I wanted fry's they would of then given me a plus one by that of changing it to fry's, on top of the tots, still, for about $8 I was still wanting to eat as I didn't eat the salty tots or even really like sauces, as the Chicken tenders being the choosing made for, was in a sea of BBQ some call and wow no nontoxic and I feel that that is toxic in my life at times.

So if I could have and can say ask for just tenders, and I think that they said that is what they got; if that is the only way to get Chicken tenders, then why go their, for calling it one thing only gives it a name and I want more then a name by Chicken tenders swimming in.

Okay will I be getting again no...it was well, a means of fast food, that meal for sure showcased it being as such."}
{"text":"The food was hot and well, right now, it was good and well, freshness, was their and even the tater tots tasted good not too salty, as I got the checken tenders as well, it was nice and still I wasn't ed more tender then other and that's just me as they be a good sized by seemingly an average size....it's by that you can see that life is a means of doing something worth going to as seeing how since can then by then a means by self being a self by all means if it's life by its self being well it was simply a good meal.and it was nice to see and have,thank you"}
{"text":"We pull up, about 9:30 pm. We pulled up into a stall. When we were ready to order, we were told the stalls were closed for the night,  ok cool.. we go to the drive thru , one car ahead of us . We ordered an all American dog,  lg. Chili cheeze tots , and a sonic burger. .. we waited 14 mins.  the lady acted clueless when we gave her our order. Our chili cheese tots came in a lg coney box and was only filled half way. No seriously,  half the box was empty. And the burger was cold. Only thing that was good was the rt.44 ocean water.   Thanks YULIANA  and crew I'll go to another sonic from now on. It looks like yall ate half our food. For real"}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru, ordered the foot long chili cheese coney dog. Worst I've ever had at any Sonic I've been at. Hot dog wasn't cooked enough & they didn't put much chili & cheese."}
{"text":"first time eating at sonic!  they need to open some of these in the bay area!  had the spicy southwest burger, which has crispy jalapeno strips, with some fries and a cherry limeaid drink.  pretty yummy!"}
{"text":"THIRTY minutes in drive thru on a Tuesday night. Slowest service ever received at any Sonic."}
{"text":"Slow Slow Slow took 20 plus minutes for a combo #1... Ordered it Large size. The fries were pathetic said sorry about the wait fresh fries so be careful they're hot, but nope small ass warm fries not even filled up... The drink was large... Hopefully the burger is good smh..."}
{"text":"Just got a shake and a strawberry lemonade slushy. I made it to happy hour and paid half off."}
{"text":"I like the 50's style restaurants, for some weird reason.  The drive in feature is what actually got me hooked, along with the car hop people that come out with your food.  Yes, I know its fast food.  I can't help it.  Sometimes, a girls gotta indulge, ya know?

When you pull up, theres parking spaces with a menu per parking spot.  You have time to sit and review in your car while you decide what it is that you want.  No pressure waiting in line at a drive thru, espcially if your not sure what you want.

I come here mostly for the drinks during happy hour.  Their half off, and a 44 ounce slush lasts me the rest of the day.   They really do have awesome drinks here, and every day between 2-4 you can do happy hour.  Thats why I come here.  I also think too that they have half priced burgers after 5pm!"}
{"text":"Don't come here often, but when I'm having a sweet tooth I do come and enjoy their shakes and blasts. Service is quick and usually the items are made how I like them. My girl always gets a blast that has nuts in them and asks for extra, however it never seems like there are anymore nuts then normal and we paid for extra!! I also from time to time get the chili dog which is good! People that bring out my food seem nice as well. My suggestion here would be to make it possible to leave a tip when paying for your food with the card at the machine. I almost always forget and don't have cash on me. Feel bad just leaving them a dollar tip."}
{"text":"If you can get past the burns in your mouth from their coffee their food is tasty.
Super-sonic breakfast burrito is delicious and made even better with the jalapeños. 

Currently there is a car hop classic combo for 2.99, cheeseburger and medium onion rings. This is more than enough for diner even for me. The onion rings are to die for,

Love their slushes.
The orange cream slush will satisfy our creamsicle craving.

The water at this location is a little strong and does effect the flavor of the beverages.

Oh yeah, and if you couldn't tell from the first line the coffee is about 3 degrees cooler than molten lava, so ask for ice if you want to drink it anytime soon."}
{"text":"Out was slower than at others but it was busy.
We got shakes and cream slushes only.
There food is okay but their slushes are outstanding"}
{"text":"Stop...... slushy time.

Happy hour route 44 strawberry  slush fix for under $2. That deserves  5 stats right there.

Actual ice in the slush here.

Cannot comment on the other stuff since this is the only reason i frequent Sonic.

If you want a burger and fries that has sat around for an hour go to McDonald's, i would question it if my order was ready in the 10 seconds it takes  to drive from the order point to the window. 

Plus the whole point of this place is to park and enjoy the old car hop experience."}
{"text":"I've been going to this sonic for at least 7 years and it's continually gone downhill. Used to be on point with service and food, but they keep hiring these younger incompetent teenagers. Tonight was the third time in a row they've done a horrible job. Pulled up and had to literally repeat my order five times for the kid to finally get it, when I asked for a breakfast sandwich he kept asking if I wanted a toaster sandwich and finally gave up and told him cancel it, and I ordered a snickers custard concrete, and a dunked garlic Parmesan chicken sandwich. Got home and the dunked sandwich was literally disgusting looking, it wasn't dunked by any means and just had the sauce thrown on top and it tasted like a dry chicken sandwich with little to no flavor. Then I finally get to my custard concrete and of course it's a regular snickers milkshake. Not sure what has changed in the hiring process but they need to get a new staff on board that is capable of handling the food at the very least, let alone one with subpar customer service. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Zero stars in order!!!! Where do they find idiots like they have working here. Big mistake. Gave them another chance. Ordered a strawberry limeaid got soda water with a lime in it."}
{"text":"People were absolutely rude !! I pressed the button atleast 5 times and still no answer
Never coming here again 
And the \"girl\" gave me my drink with an attitude and didn't even say thank you."}
{"text":"I love this burger joint. The drive thrus are awesome. get the cherry limeades when you are there, it is very refreshing and delicious. the coney dogs are great too. not to expensive at all if you got a budget and they are very quick."}
{"text":"Typical fast food but also has a nice dessert menu and sometimes get cheap happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"Yummy Flavored Slushes! My favorite is Cranberry & Green Apple! They also have a Happy Hour with 1/2 price Drinks. Note they have crushed ice, not cubed! This is a big deal for me, because I'm crazy like that ;-}

I'm a Huge Sonic Fan, Always will be!

This location is Excellent, Staff is friendly & accommodating 

There drinks, ice cream, snacks are always yummy! Its rare if I eat a full meal at Sonic so I couldn't review too much in that. 

I say \"TREAT YOURSELF ONCE IN AWHILE FOR A TREAT & GO TO SONIC\"! There prices are as low as you can get"}
{"text":"this sonic location sucks! its the slowest location ive ever been too in clark county! well come to think of it, slowest location ive been too anywhere! i couldn't believe how long the drive-thru wait was. at least 20 minutes for a dam slush! at least 12 cars in line----all honking their horn! it made me late to an appointment. management better start stepping in & pay full attention to what the hell is going on. looks like this location hasn't received a good review in ages. 

warning: do not go to this location!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"You know, it's fast and convenient, the two reasons you would choose Sonic. Nothing on their menu is actually good for you, but this can probably be said for about most mega food corps. 

Their burger meat has this distinct flavor thar kind of turns me off and I refuse to pay actual real money for a hot dog from any Sonic because of how cheap they are at the store. 

I have a strange infatuation with the oreo blast which is just hyper-obeseogenic. What's wrong with me?? Do I just crave the things you shouldn't want?

Anyways their bacon is a joke, how can you charge me an extra couple dollars when I get this tiny little corner slice of a burnt morsel? The bacon is overpriced for their quality/quantity in my opinion. Omg their fries are just not quite the calibur you'd expect. Makes me question the brand itself at times.

 I won't eat a burger or chicken sandwich here ever again but I'll keep my shameful desert habits for now! Thanks Sonic for the Deserts"}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 star I would. Worst Sonic ever! This place should be shut down. Food was wrong and tasted like it was left overs from last week."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Sonic compared to other fast food restaurants.   I've been here for both breakfast and lunch.  Really enjoy the breakfast burrito, the tots are tasty while properly salted, the burgers are up to par, but the texas toast sandwich I had more recently was awesome.    I only wish that there were more options on the east side of cleveland."}
{"text":"I just thought it was OK.  I have had much better experiences at a Sonic, just a different location.  I was really expecting a much more expanded menu then what I was introduced to on Mayfield.  Apparently all of the advertisements on TV are for rotating seasonal items which is fine, I did OK with the options.  

I went with the Chicken Club which was huge!  Consisted of 3 breaded tenders, bacon, and the works.  I could have used more sauce since the sandwich did seem a little dry when all put together even though the chicken itself was very moist.  Tots were great as always.  Wife got the burger but they F'd up the order and gave her onions on it, oh well, a little adjustment and it met her expectations.  She did enjoy her drink, cherry limeade.  

I think I'm just a little hell bent on them not having the mushroom burger that I've heard so much about.  I'll be back to try as soon as its back in 'season'.  I will be stopping back in again to try some of their hot dogs since I've heard some good things along with the breakfast burrito (Jeff B.).  I'll update accordingly.

Side note, the place seems to have died down a little although still busy.  There were some car ports open but we opted to go inside since we needed to feed the kid also.  Luckily we did get a booth with no wait.....whew......I was almost so excited that I didn't notice how messy the place was.   Didn't matter though since Hurricane Hallie was about to blow through that booth area and we were not about to clean up after her.

Will be back.  Really want to get up to a 4 star experience cause we do love us some Sonic."}
{"text":"I ordered a sugar-free lemonade here every Wednesday for about 5 months, then one day the girl taking the order said that they didn't have sugar-free lemonade. And that they never did. Hmm. I understand why it was so good now."}
{"text":"This place has either gotten my order wrong or forgotten part of my order 5 out of the 6 times that I've been there. Twice they gave me a completely different sandwich than what I ordered and I had to drive all the way back to exchange it. Most of the time their fries are soggy and cold, sandwiches and burgers are ALWAYS cold and soggy, and chicken tenders and boneless buffalo wings have always been super hard and overdone. Not sure what the heck happened to this place - used to be great. Don't even know how they're still open."}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 star I would. I only got a medium strawberry limeade. Had maybe 5 baby sips because it tasted horrible. Dumped it all out and found lettuce in it. I'm never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Will never return. Way too slow and don't bother ordering a blaster with anything in it (especially the stuff with the peanut butter in the center). You will get nothing in the center and a little bit of stuff on the top. This happened 3 times to me."}
{"text":"I'm split down the middle. I'd rate the food at five stars. The breakfast sandwiches are the best I've had in town. Amazing. 

Unfortunately, it is literally the exception rather than the rule that they get orders right. One star for the service. I don't know if they haven't been taught to check the orders before giving them, but it's annoying to get home and find out the order is FUBAR. 

Good food. Bad service. Average review."}
{"text":"Spent $40 on just ice cream treats (Blasts as they are called) for my kids and they were all melty messes!!! Dripping soup can hardly be called a frozen treat! On top of that, the candy in the Blasts was severely lacking. Terrible! I'll stick to the Sonic on Tropicana. Or perhaps Dairy Queen would be a better choice."}
{"text":"I went to this Sonic the other night for the first time in years and waited 40 mins to get my food!!! I was in the drive thru! I the fries were gross and tasted so old. The burger was ok but for a 40 minute wait, everything should be piping hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Seeing as they're open until 11, my hubby and I went around 9 for a late meal. This is the closest Sonic to us, 20 min from our house, and was our first time there. I was excited for the desserts I'd seen advertised in their funny commercials. There's a '50s feel with the drive-in stalls and them bringing food out to your car. It looked big, clean and a total of four other cars came while we dined. Apparently, that was too many customers for them to handle.
It was difficult for me to see the menu from the passenger side. It was easier to look it up from Yelp than to crane around my husband. Ordering was incredibly frustrating. It seemed like the woman's first day. My hub had to say it all slowly, repeating everything several times, only to have her say it back to him wrong several times! He thought we were being pranked. She got our drinks wrong so many times that we just said fine, whatever she brings we'll drink. We didn't even bother trying to correct her at that point. I wanted to order dessert later - the main reason for going there - but we didn't because we couldn't go through the ordering process again! My husband said he expected Ashton Kutcher to be waiting around the corner with the Punk'd crew.
It took a long time for our food to come out but at least it wasn't cold like some others have said in their reviews. She apologized and also said their outdoor payment machines were on the fritz. She said it took awhile because they're super busy. Umm, how is that few customers considered busy? They're probably understaffed at night. Our cheeseburgers, fries and tots were REALLY good, or was it just that we were so hungry at that point? Our random drinks were fine (liked the real fruit at the bottom!). Got a grilled cheese for our dog from the kids menu and she liked it fine, being that she's a dog, but it was actually quite soggy and unappetizing. I wish I'd been able to get a dessert though."}
{"text":"A burger chain from my childhood.  Love the sweet onion rings.   The menu has expanded tremendously over the past decade.   The original burger has not changed much.   The drive in is a fun concept,  reminding me of drive in movie theaters.   They now have an app as well as paper coupons once in a while.  There are specials too that do not need coupons,  such as corn dog sales on a specific day of the week.  I like that grilled onions for the burgers are an option.  They also offer a small picnic table area at every location I've patroned.  Sometimes servers are on roller skates.  To me,  it's an iconic American fast food chain."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever my food was all burnt took 30 min to get to me in the drive thru and 10 cars waiting behind me getting ignored"}
{"text":"The service is not good. They don't honor the specials like they are supposed to. Corporate stating you can use a text that is sent and then this location saying you cannot. The workers cannot count change, they mess it up 75% of the time. With every issue combined, I don't think we will be returning to this location. We have gone back so many times hoping for a better experience, but at this point that hasn't happened."}
{"text":"I must love punishment-
Love my daughter enough that I came back for a simple chocolate shake-
I should've driven away after waiting for 5 minutes and seeing a car pull up several minutes after I pressed the button listening to them order before me.......

The only redeeming factor was they actually got the order correct for once- wow!!!!!! 




How hard is it to make a cherry limeade and put a scoop of pineapple in it??
Apparently extremely difficult because this is the 3rd time I've ordered a simple drink and had it come out without a simple ingredient- 

As well, this last time, both my order and my daughters were cold by the time we got home (barely 1 mile away). Maybe because after waiting for 5 minutes for the car hop to bring out the \"corrected\" drink, we got sick of waiting for it and finally left.  

Best part- my daughters kids meal with hot dog was put in the bag on its end....so where do you think the mustard and ketchup ended up.......

If you're ever in the mood to take your money and throw it away- come to this location, it's a guarantee that you will leave with $20 less in your wallet and nothing to show for it. 


Update-

EVERYONE AT THIS LOCATION SHOULD SLAP THEMSELVES AND RUN IN TRAFFIC-
HOW FREAKING HARD IS IT TO FOLLOW A SIMPLE FLIPPING ORDER AND PUT THE FREAKING KETCHUP AND MUSTARD ON THE KIDS HOTDOG!!!!!!

Seriously- your parents should be sent to prison for environmental terrorism-  you ALL that work at this location are useless and a burden on society."}
{"text":"Their drive thru after 10pm is SLOW AS ALL SHIT. Maybe it's an issue beyond the workers control but I'm currently two cars behind the ordering platform and there is a line of 7 cars (& growing) behind me. This has been the case for Me on multiple visits. I would just not come and avoid the headache but my other Options are dumpster juice McDonald's, Taco Bell or Roberto's. I'm literally not trying to shit my night away so this is my best options when i don't want to cook. Please do better, for the sake of my butthole and the fact that all the 15 year olds working here are probably learning awful customer service skills. One day when they move up or transition into a job that at least pays them well for dealing with asshole customers they will learn that efficiency, attentiveness and TIMING can make you a thousandaire. I started this review at 10:48 and it's currently 11:59...I JUST ordered."}
{"text":"Giving it one star cause I can't give it 0 over twenty minutes for 2 corn dogs and milk shake terrible!"}
{"text":"Is there anyway to give less than one star? Or even negative Stars?! I just wasted my time in their drive-thru for 15 minutes.
Not sure if the girl at the window was having issues with her headset or what, but I had to repeat my order three times I'd also heard the people in front of me repeat their orders so I made sure I spoke loudly on purpose. 
Then she mumbled my total, and when I asked her to repeat it there was no answer. 
I honked my horn, I yelled at the top of my voice \"hello\" and was completely ignored, I even tapped on the microphone, still no response.
Then I saw one of the girls coming out to a vehicle, so I yelled out, \"Excuse me!\", to her.
It was quiet enough that I heard my voice echo through the parking lot, yet she blatantly ignored me and continued walking. Finally I just left and noticed that there were still three cars ahead of me waiting at the window. From where I sat I could see into the booth, and all I could see where people rubbing their eyes and no one with a headset. I don't know what's going on, and I hope it's just a fluke, but that service was completely unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Came here again today after the manager assured me that my last time here was a fluke and would never happen again.  

Mistake.  


Been sitting at the order kiosk for about 20 minutes.  We ordered. We paid.  We asked where our food was.  We were told it was \"coming out right now.\"   We waited some more.  Someday we may get our food.  I'll be napping here in parking lot until then."}
{"text":"I'm out visiting from California and this place is the best Sonics I have been to. I just wish that we had one as good as this one in my home state.  The two that we have are not even close to this Sonics."}
{"text":"I am a fan of sonic. Especially the experience but this one in particular is inside Walmart. The staff is often times looking drained and not pleasant. They charge for drink refills and close off most of the sitting areas more then 50% of the time that I've been there. Only reason I keep coming back is I have children and unfortunately this is the Walmart I frequent often. I really wish they would learn to SMILE and be a bit more attentive and stop closing down more then half of the store because they don't want to have to clean it after 6pm."}
{"text":"The food is ok here but the wait!! We waited for over 25 minutes in the drive thru. We would've had a quicker time to sit at a restaurant than go to the sonic drive thru. All the workers did was just chat and socialize with eachother too, when there was a long long line of customers. Customers behind us started pulling off and abandoning their orders because they got tired of the wait as well. Not a very good experience."}
{"text":"We came here the other night to satisfy our sweet tooth. We ordered the lava cake with ice cream and caramel. We were a disappointed. It's safe to say we will not be ordering it again from here."}
{"text":"Make sure to check your bag for your food and any condiments that you ask for. Most of the time something will be missing."}
{"text":"Just lost my Sonic's virginity. I must say I was pretty satisfied with the good. The burgers are waaaay better than McDonalds and as for the price, it's affordable for on the road. The cherry limeade is a must. Super delish. I would definitely come back but there's not one around where I live. I might be a little bias cause I'm a sucker for burgers. Tater tots were fresh, hot, and crispy."}
{"text":"Wow really bad service tonight! The lady was rude and cut me off 3 times. Then i asked a simple question and was ignored until I pushed the button and got another girl on the intercom. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"After seeing a $.79 special advertised all over sonic's Facebook page my children were very excited to go. Unfortunately they would not honor the price because it was their happy hour. The happy hour price is not the same as what was advertised. Give me a break that you can't work around the register price not interested in going to sonic. disappointed kids all because you couldn't honor what was advertised all over the Internet. Instead we will get our treat at bahama bucks."}
{"text":"Plain and simple, a must-stop when I visit Vegas. It's right up the street from the Rio Hotel, open 24 hours and THEY HAVE TATER TOTS!! What else could you be craving at 3am??"}
{"text":"Horrible dinner tonight. Use to love the coneys but I swear they are using Hornell chilli. And now a burnt dog! And the onion rings seamed to taste like the where re-cooked. Bad food and a bunch of kids who don't have a clue what customer service is"}
{"text":"Tuesday night sweet tooth went unsatisfied as we started to order some frozen desserts.  Only to be shot down with, \"I'm sorry but we're out of ice cream tonight\". WHAT?  Are you kidding me?  Plenty of other spots to go for dessert and we will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Sat at the speaker for 10minutes before anyone took my order. A few cars behind me left. Worst service I've ever had here. Total wait time so far is 17 minutes and counting, and all I wanted was a couple drinks.

Update:
Ended up leaving empty handed and pissed.

Another update! They closed! How bad can it be? Well they are right next to a skate park and a school and they failed!"}
{"text":"I've lived by this sonic many years now and everytime I've gone within the span of years it has just been a horrible experience. 

Food is always cold. Sonic car hops are always rude and the management seems even worse. The food service isnt even prompt like other fast food joints. 

This fast food restaurant is really disappointing. Id tell people to save your money rather than spend it on these over priced food items."}
{"text":"I'm so sad about this experience. Sonics is rare from where I am from, so I was so excited to see it in passing. I've had it a couple of times while I was up in Northern California in school, but I remember I noted NOT to order the food. I thought maybe this was a different situation and maybe Sonics could redeem themselves. 

We stopped by here to grab some food and a slush. I got the watermelon slush and the chicken strips. The watermelon slush was alright; it tasted of fake fruit concentrate, but the slushes are so refreshing on a hot day. However, my styrofoam cup somehow had a hole on the bottom, which didn't mean good news for my clothes and the rental car. I was so grateful to have worn black that day. 

Chicken strips were dry and tasteless. Totally verifies my \"never order food at Sonics\" theory. Probably won't be craving this for a while, and not so sad that it's rare around my area."}
{"text":"Service SUCKS. They can't make the featured dessert but can make it into a shake. So I order 2 shakes and the waitress/car hop brings out 2 cups that look identical. She can't tell me whats what and doesn't care to help figure it out. The best part is she gave me no spoons or straws to eat my SHAKE. Ugh! Not going back.

My Shake wasn't even mixed. Peanut butter was all at the bottom and my husbands Oreos were all at the bottom."}
{"text":"Zero stars if I could.

It wasn't even busy here.  I saw at least four employees.  After pushing the red button it was at least two minutes before my order was taken.  The new digital menu boards say when your food is done and is being delivered.  That must be done on an automatic timer because once I got the \"your order is being delivered\" message, I waited and waited.  If I hadn't already paid with my card, I would have left.

It was at least 16 minutes for a cherry limeade and shake before I stopped/started timing.  It was excessive amount of time to wait.  I didn't get an apology or any acknowledgement from the staff about the long wait."}
{"text":"I've been here about once a week for the past two months and have always had great service.  I usually get drinks in the morning or during happy hour.  My only complaint is even asking for \"easy ice\" the majority of the cup is filled with it.

The diet cherry limeade is delicious and I feel guilty for drinking it, even though it is a \"free food\" by my dietary standards!"}
{"text":"The service and food was ok considering it was their second week open for business in an area that has no other Sonic's for 200 miles - it was hectic, but the staff kept their cool. I love being able to sit in the car - although not too often. The food was ok. I had a chicken bacon wrap with a dr. pepper."}
{"text":"Great service.  I read complaints about greasy burgers, wait that is why you come to sonic is for the greasy food. HELLO.  Best iced tea in town hands down."}
{"text":"We are fans of Sonic. We always get either their hotdogs or hamburgers with plain tater tots and one of their many milkshakes they offer.

Be sure to sign up for the specials that are sent  via text."}
{"text":"They really don't make it like other Sonic stores. Skimp out on a lot of little details. On the shakes we ordered, no sprinkles on any of them and on one of them...cherry was same size as whipped cream."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative stars I would. This location use to be my favorite but I the last I've given the 2 different opportunitiesbut they have failed!!! The menu board said my order was on the way, I waited 15 minutes after that to call back in and ask where my order was. The manager came out gave all kinds of excuses as to why I hadn't revived it yet. Then when the carhop brought me my order another 15 minutes later she comes out and gives me 2 drink coins, really. Oh wait the my order want even right. How do you take and mess up a cherry limeade and an order of wings. Don't waste your time here go to another location -Craig road."}
{"text":"Yeah baby! Sonics is the bomb! I used to live on the east coast when my husband was in the military & that is when I discovered Sonics...well I lied. I actually discovered Sonics on our drive across country from LA to VA when we stopped at one in Texas. Wow their burgers are tasty and Tater tots!!! Who doesn't love tot's! They are like a Lil' ball of hash browns that are suitable anytime. When I was at this particular location the service was reasonable-be fair people they are only high school kids- and the food was yummy! The funny thing was that we went here on a Saturday night around 2am & it was packed with High School kids....doesn't LV have a curfew for minors..hell it's Vegas who are we kidding. All these kids were chillin' on the hood of their rides trying to act all cool...Act being the key word here...that alone was worth it. There was even a kid probably around 10 yrs old tagging along with his sis while she was mackin' on her man right in front of our car. Damn! Where was his mama! Anyhow, I like this place point blank. And if you show up late enough you might catch someone acting the fool like we did."}
{"text":"Would love to give more stars but what a cheapass place.  Ordered a milkshake at 7:59, by the time it arrived it was after 8:00. They are offering their half price shakes after 8:00. Even though it was delivered after 8:00 they wouldn't give it to me at half price because I ordered it one minute too soon.  I hate lazy workers who don't want to be bothered making things right for a customer."}
{"text":"Your typical Sonic, busy and slow service is more the norm at this location than other locations, however I also have to wonder about the cleanliness of this location.  Looking in through the window you could clearly see the lemonade machine was dirty and probably hadn't been cleaned in awhile."}
{"text":"We've never been disappointed with his location.  

Great slushes and milkshakes.  

Perfect stop on the way to costco!

Happy hour rocks!"}
{"text":"Every Sonic should be like this one. If you choose to eat in your car, they have new order screens which makes this Sonic look fresh and new. If you go through the drive thru, it will be fast and friendly! It's a win win"}
{"text":"As mentioned in another post, this drive-thru is mind bogglingly slow.  There are times when there are two vehicles in front of me and I've waited more than 20 minutes for my soda. Then, after waiting all time, when I pull up to the window they take my money, close the window and walk deeper into the kitchen area.  I want to get out of my car and announced that the drinks are right next to the window!!

They drive me crazy."}
{"text":"Too bad you have to choose 1 star. Been living over here for over 15 years and this Sonic has had its up and downs but the last year EVeRY SINGLE time I come here the service and food is crap! Our order is always wrong. The iced tea is spoiled every time without fail. Clean your friggin tanks! They have 15 kids working inside and all of them running around like immature chickens. I hope the franchise and the managers can get a grip soon so I don't have to keep driving to the one on Craig and Losee."}
{"text":"This place deserves 1 star! & here's is why ... I've been to this same location 3 different times because it's close to my place and my moms who I like to visit every other week the first time I came here I ordered ocean water which is a blue coconut flavored soda with nerds .. I got to my moms .. the soda omg it was flat & half way melted I was so upset I called the store & complained the manger said to come in whenever & grab one & of course I'm super busy I don't really have time to go back they honestly should of just gave me a refund !! Second time I went there I was gonna give this place another shot ... I ordered a Reece cup blast with extra Reece cups large size which I paid Extra it said so on my receipt so I get to my moms again & what do you know once I dig my spoon inside the ice cream is melted they put way too much whip cream then the ice cream & it was a medium size & no extra Reece cups like I asked three times .. how do you mess up a shake ? Really my order is not ever complicated I order 1 thing !! & of course I call back again & talk to manger he offered me my money back .... still i was upset I was really looking forward to my Reece cup blast !  I haven't been there in a couple months so I decide to give this place another chance I know stupid choice on my part again !! This time I order a number 4 bacon cheeseburger & fries with a shake Reece cup blast I made sure everything was on point with my order making sure they repeat it more then two times which they should do either way repeating someone's order so this doesn't happen !! Anyway I drove to moms like usual starving I grab the Togo bag get out of the car & my bag completely breaks open & all my stuff falls on the driveway !! Like are you serious right now ?!?! It's like I have karma at that place !! Don't they know any better to double bag something that's heavy ?!?  Come on .. sorry this all needs to be said stay away from this location this was my last time here !! I will drive my happy ass 15 mins away to the sonic on Pecos thank you very much ."}
{"text":"The worst Sonic burger in town. When they're placed an order she told me what the order was I told her to tell you what cancel this I don't want that she rented anyway I paid with an ATM card so they refused to give me my cash back to me I'd have to wait 2-3 days.. the manager I don't think she even graduated high school she's lucky to get past the 10th grade that is a worst place I have ever seen in my life. Then she sit there and talk to me like she owned me she's trying to tell me where you go to Walmart they do  the same thing.. I told that lady hello I don't shop at Walmart maybe you do"}
{"text":"Used a gift card, and had to push the button twice to get an answer, that was the only moment I didn't feel like I was at a Five Star Restaurant.
 Brooke rushed my medium Extreme Tots out, ran my card for me, checked that everything was ok, and said to let her know when I was done so she could take my trash.
 She checked back! Just to make sure everything was ok, and tell me not to rush, she just wanted to endure everything was right.
 My Tots were hit, covered in chili, cheese, onions, jalepenos, and ranch, with extra napkins.
 While I ate I read my Kindle and watched Brooke zip around like a bumble bee cleaning tables, trash, and anything else she could reach! 
 Before 10 am large soda are $1, there are other specials, too. Get a coke and add cherry and chocolate for $ .60. You won't regret it.
 They have tables outside, so I'll be back with several of my dogs, and a kid or two.  Love this place."}
{"text":"I've tried this place multiple times and it's just going downhill faster  and faster.
 I pulled up in a parking space and pushed the button. I waited over ten minutes and pushed it multiple times. Nothing.
 There are three cars in the parking lot and no one visible
Inside.
 I pulled into the drive through, ordered, pulled to the window to pay. Sat there for 8 min. THEN she came to the window and asked what size I ordered.   ???
I waited ten more minutes and honked. She came back and asked what i ordered. I told her again.
 She disappeared into the window again. Cars behind me started honking.
 I thought at least my Extreme Tots would be hot and fresh. Uh, no Dave.
Food was lukewarm.
Pecan Pie Master Blast was good.
 Think I'll give up on this place."}

{"text":"Went here today. Serve was fine but my double burger I paid for was a single and the large tater tots was cold and 1/2 full. I won't waste my $10 there again."}
{"text":"Been in Madison just over a year now and still trying to find decent food. I am from the south and have no idea how these people enjoy their fast food/take out with so few good options. This Sonic is definitely reminiscent of the Sonic I used to enjoy back at home. I have been with my husband and daughter at least 6 or 7 times and had nothing but great experiences each time. Our order has always been correctly and freshly made. I love that they make your food to order; we haven't gotten a cold meal here yet. The managers on site are always nice and making sure things are flowing smoothly. I am quite surprised by the negative reviews because whenever we get an urge for Sonic, I know I can go to this location and get a fresh, decent meal."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour (2-5)pm drinks are half off. Got a large cherry limeade for $1.14 tax included. What a great deal on a nice Vegas day."}
{"text":"Worst Service! They never responded to our push of the button... no response.... Additionally - the young lady who finally responded had no idea what was on the menu.

Never again. 

So sad - my husband has never been... and I guess we never will....."}
{"text":"After all the bad experiences I have had at this Sonic I decided to finally write a review after today's FINAL experience. 

I came here with my family and ordered over 10 drinks and a large tater tot. The order took forever and when they brought it out not a single drink was labeled and the tots were freezing cold. Who doesn't label drinks when there is that many? Seriously? To make it worse we asked for a replacement tot because of our freezing cold ones and both the worker and manager were super rude and said they can only replace it with a medium. Excuse me? We PAYED for a LARGE. Then to top it off when the replacement was brought the manager said they needed the other tots back. Ha. Not that I was going to eat them but that is just crappy customer service. 

Congratulations on both terrible and lost service Sonic."}
{"text":"I know it's fast food and of course it does the job if your hungry but fast is not what they do. You will sit in drive thru for 20 minutes to get your order. Don't go if you are in a hurry"}
{"text":"I'm honestly not even sure where to begin...  

I stopped by for quick burger on my way home from work because I thought I was actually about to die from starvation.   But a quick burger was definitely not on the menu for me that night.  I pressed the red button, and the automated system told me that someone would be with me shortly. After nearly 10 minutes; an angry voice snapped at me, informing me that only the drive thru window was open.  

1. Why would the system not be programmed to simply tell me that instead of making me wait and starve?

2. The employee had no business snapping at me when the system told me to wait.  

Anyway..  I ordered a junior double cheeseburger.  The person taking my order repeated \"super sonic something or other\". I corrected this person twice, and the response I got was \"ketchup blah blah blah\". I said \"what?\"  The employee said \"ok drive to the window\".  I did, because the employee clearly couldn't hear me.  When I got to the window I was given the wrong sandwich, I tried to explain to the employee what had happened and was met with nothing but bad attitude.  Apparently it was my fault that the employee couldn't hear my order.  Said employee repeated the entire conversation, attempting to make me feel like I'm wrong, but still conceded that I could have my order changed out for the correct one.  Gee, thanks.  
As I was handed the burger; employee mumbled something to someone else about throwing the burger under a heat lamp and everything being the other employees fault.  This employee had the disposition of a mule."}
{"text":"The food is across the board same quality sonic quality, nothing more, nothing less. The wait on the other hand seems to be a lot longer than most other drive through / sonics. Even if you're ordering the easiest, smallest order, the wait is oftentimes 5+ minutes, without any other customers being there. I don't get it. So come if you have more time to spare than just a quick drive through, in and out experience."}
{"text":"What is it about Sonic in Chandler ! Every time i go its something from ordering to missing items wrong items wrong size and more. Im definitely not the only one ive talked to neighbors and friends in town and they have complaints also. I order 3 boom boxes they don't have the boxes to put them in WOW ! They bring our order wrong size drink i tell the car hop she hands it to me and says let me talk to my Manager. OK Then i tell her we are missing a burger she says check the bag remember we ordered boom BOXES ! Its not there so lets fix that too. Of course we wait the burger comes great im still waiting on the drink. It finally gets here and you can tell its been sitting water down im already upset. Then i see a puddle on my console one of the drinks has a cracked cup and of course it was a cherry slush and i have tan interior. Now im done. Manager comes out named Adam and apologizes and now i tell him whats going on remember we are sitting and time has pasted so by the time he brings the slush and so gracious upgrades 1 size our food is cold. Im like that's it i give him back everything and tell him just refund me im not waiting for these people to mess up another order and sit another 30 minutes to get it. I ask for the corporate number and asked him to write it down he said it would take a little for him to do that. I said thanks for nothing ill get it myself and definitely give corporate a call. Come on if im getting this and everyone else is why cant they fix it. Just read the yelps . When they first open i was excited a Sonic down the street now i drive past or try to make my order simple like 1 drink its crazy. 

3 SONIC BOOM BOXES not in box but bags . missing burger , wrong size drink , cracked cup now i have nice stains and food cold ! COME ON !

SONIC CORPORATE PLEASE STEP IN AND FIX THIS MESS BECAUSE THEY CANT  !"}
{"text":"I really don't like the food here it is soso and over priced. Why eat this when In N Out is down the block. However; the drinks are awesome and deserts are good tood. Are you supposed to tip the help though? I am undecided on this because if I am buying $4 in food shoud I give a $1? I always feel mean mugged when I don't tip here."}
{"text":"I stopped at this Sonic because I was out doing errands and need something for my low blood sugar. I had not eaten lunch (being a diabetic that is a big no, no) so I thought I'd get something to eat and a drink because it was happy hour. YAY for half priced drinks! I've also been trying to stick to the Atkins diet so I was debating between a double cheese burger and the grilled chicken sandwich. I picked the grilled chicken. When I got it home, the piece of chicken was very tiny. It didn't even make it to the edge of the bun. I only used half of the bun and disposed of the rest. I just feel for $4.39 I should get a little bigger piece of chicken. I've had this sandwich from other locations before and I know it was not that tiny! What happened?

My drink was tasty and they even got the diet cherry in it correctly! I used the drive-thru and the service was great. They were very friendly and quick. 

Normally I love Sonic and their food, but this time I was severely disappointed! I could have just gone to Wendy's or Jack in the Box and gotten the same sandwich for the same price or cheaper and it would have been a lot bigger. Check your portions Sonic!"}
{"text":"Normally okay. Food is sometimes cold/lukewarm with online ordering, even if you show up at the assigned time. Today was a pretty poor experience - cold food, wrong items, no sauces."}

{"text":"Me and my families first time was last Saturday, about 5 pm.  All we ordered were soft drinks and mozerella sticks.  The wait was very long.  But what was more frustrating was the were jumping cars and giving them there orders before us!!!!!!  I asked the kid why did it take so long?  And he said there are short of staff and they have new employees, well which is it?  But for as far as the food, it was awful.  I will never go back to this company at all."}
{"text":"Just got dinner at sonic. There burgers are great. Deserts, outstanding. Why was there Sunday 5.00 special chicken petrified and inedible? This is Sunday people! We got chili cheese fries. We ordered LARGE. We got small, in a large container. Rip off. Only reason you do t get 1 star is the bbq bourbon chicken was pretty good."}
{"text":"Second time being here. First time I ordered a frozen cherry limeade and they couldn't figure out what frozen meant. Second time I order a frozen cherry limeade and a large fry. Received a cherry slush and cold, stale half filled fries. What the actual hell. I get it's a little after lunch hour but these were hard as rocks, tasted like a starchy mess fries. I'd be ashamed to hand that to a customer having worked at a restaurant for four years. Step it up Sonic."}
{"text":"Maybe Sonics just isn't what it used to be. The food has gone downhill over the years. The drinks I feel are the main reason they stay in business. 
I will not however be returning to thus one ever. Lana was horrible. 
Out of chili well that's okay but no apology for that at all. Makes me wonder if they were out or just lazy. While waiting 10 minutes in the window for the food they weren't out of, we tried numerous times to call and get her attention so that when everything was ready we weren't waiting another 5 for her to gather all the stuff she would clearly not have the insight to keep ready by the window.  She either genuinely didn't hear us or blatantly ignored us. I'll opt for the first hoping for the best of her. 
Then we get our food, and she actually asked me can you please check the bag and make sure I put your gator tots in there. (Seriously you literally seconds ago put food in my bag and you don't remember what you put in here?) 
Wow! 
To top it off she looked like she had been worked to death, someone give her a day off to rest. 
Either way this entire place is disgusting, we asked for ketchup mayo mustard packs. They had idk what on the packs, I'm pretty sure in the pile she tossed in there we ended up with someone's punch out coupon for a drink. 
Don't recommend this one."}
{"text":"My family and I travel out to LV at least once a year and one of our \"traditions\" has been to pick up food from this location at least once during our trip...this was our favorite location out of all the locations we have tried in Nevada and CA up until yesterday.  We were unsure if it was just an off day or if they have just gone completely downhill.  Our small order for 3 people took forever, even though we did not order any special requests.  On top of that, the lady who took our drive thru order had no idea about the menu...she did not even know that there was a foot long hot dog and tater tots special for $3.99 and ended up overcharging us.  Good thing I looked at the receipt.  The bf cautioned me to use cash since my debit card has been over charged in the past.  So either this location recently had a turnover in staff or it has just sunk downhill.  

The food was just meh aside from taking longer than usual to prepare (3 cheeseburgers, coney, tater tots...no shakes or smoothies, but many factors could have gone into that.  This was very unfortunate, but we are not locals, so our absence will not hurt the establishment much."}
{"text":"Tell me why they only do drive through only at night? Turn your signs off where you park at then it's bad for the environment wasting all that energy for nothing. I thinks it's pretty stupid to wait in a drive through of 10 people deep for a drink. I also don't appreciate when I clicked the little button they said sorry for the inconvenience were doing drive through only, and then they disconnect I need to know why!?!?"}
{"text":"Drive-In!! The wait-staff wears rollar skates! You sit in your car, order from a big menu-breakfast served all day.

My 9 yr. old loves it. It is a chain-basic, burger fair but, the salads are nice for the Mom's that have to go with!

Resonable prices and outdoor tables too! (it is hot to eat in your car-sometimes)"}
{"text":"How hard is it to understand that I want a regular #1 burger with mustard?   The options are mustard, mayo, or ketchup.   I selected mustard and guess what?  that is all I got on my burger.  Seems like there is some training needed at this establishment. I have been to Sonic establishments all over the southeast and have never had an issue.  This is the second time I have had an issue with this place and will not be back."}
{"text":"I hope the owner(s)/manager(s) read these reviews.

Folks, seriously... get it together.

We frequent this location because it's convenient (right around the corner) and the shakes are a guilty pleasure.  However, you have GOT to tighten this operation up.

1.  I wish I was exaggerating, but I am not -- EVERY time we visit, EVERY conversation with an employee LITERALLY starts with \"I'm sorry ...\".  I'm sorry for the wait, I'm sorry we forgot something, I'm sorry we got your order wrong...  I could probably make a drinking game out of every time someone starts a sentence with \"I'm sorry.\"

STOP WITH THE I'M SORRYS.  If you're constantly having to apologize, then recognize where the deficiencies are and CORRECT THEM!

2.  I find it particularly annoying when, again, EVERY time we're in the drive thru, someone walks by with a tray and asks \"did you order a ...\"?  No, that's not mine.  Repeat.  Repeat.  Guys, come on, it's not that difficult.  You have a computer that tracks orders.  You should know who ordered what!  The first order on your screen should be the first car in line.  The second should be for the second car, and so on.  What are you guys doing at this location to be so completely haphazardly lost?

It's not really the fault of the poor kids who are working here... they're all nice enough for the most part and they try, but if they're not being trained or if they're being trained in such a way that leaves them unorganized, confused, and constantly handing out apologies, the failure is not with them, it's with the managers who are supposed to have their act together and be setting a good example."}
{"text":"This Sonic is the WORST I've ever been to. My HUGE ISSUE with this location is, they lie and expect the public to believe their nonsense. I enjoy Sonic Ice and have made the decision, as of last evening, to buy my own ice maker that makes the small chewable ice I enjoy so much. 

For the last TWO YEARS, this Sonic location has been telling customers during the summer that \"We can't sell you ice, our ice maker is broken and we won't have enough for customers drinks if we sell it to you!\" Wow, TWO YEARS AND YOU HAVEN'T FIXED YOUR ICE MAKER!? 

Let's get the facts laid bare here. Sonic, including this location advertises \"We Sell Ice, Grab A Bag!\" They even have a stupid little sign they finally took down around the drive through speaker that states \"Get Your Bag Of Ice!\" 

I went to this location at 10:45pm yesterday and they close at midnight. I asked for just one bag of ice and received the stupid line yet again. The most annoying part of this stupid lie they tell is, when it's winter or breakfast time, no problem, you can buy ice! What I end up having to do, if I want Sonic ice, is drive three miles to the next location where they NEVER HAVE A PROBLEM selling me Ice!!! I can ask for Six Bags and have, NO PROBLEM!!! 

To this Sonic Franchise Owner (Imbecile)...
Stop instructing your employees to lie to customers and simply take down the bag of ice off the menu, scrape the window advertisement for ice and then place a giant sign including a message on your window \"We Don't Sell Ice At This Location, Don't Ask For It, We Hate Our Customers Asking For Something Every Other Sonic Location Sells!\" 

Option #2 (If the ice maker is broken,) FIX YOUR ICE MAKER, IT'S BEEN BROKEN FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS!\" 

Option #3 BUY A SECOND ICE MACHINE THAT'S SMALLER, BUT ALLOWS THOSE WHO WANT TO BUY ICE, TO DO SO!!! 

Option #4 Since you don't mind lying to your customers, you shouldn't have a problem lying to your insurance company. Wait until 3:00am and burn your store down! You're obviously a horrible business owner or a liar, either way, you shouldn't be conducting business this way. 

Who hasn't seen the giant Sonic Marketing Campaign with the two idiots that always go to Sonic and one of them does or says something stupid to make you think Sonic is a great place to grab food and treats! 

You the Franchisee should understand that the portion of your profits that go back to corporate, pay for this marketing and you're blowing it! 

As you can see, I'm frustrated and angry. I can't stand liars, cheats and thieves."}
{"text":"Good drive through with fast service. They haven't gotten my order wrong yet so far so good. They're corn dogs are good. Beware if you order the Chicago dog, they sometimes forget an ingredient and that jus ruins the hot dog."}

{"text":"Hello Friends, 

For what its worth, this is a nice easy date spot, as it takes you back in time to the good ol days. I do remember at one point in time the car hops were on roller skates. Now days, either not so much, or the guys were \"too cool\" for skates. Opting for their own pair of Nike's. 

I do love the menu. Believe it or not, this is only my second time trying this type of place out. It's like the old Town & Country (Wilkingson Blvd) or 21 South. If you've been to either of those places, consider this the perverbial fast food of the two. 

It's still fast food.

{"text":"They really made us wait over 20 minutes for 3 milkshakes when there were hardly any people even there. Probably the worst sonic I've ever visited in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My rating isn't about Sonic food. The food isn't really worth your money these days. The only thing you should be ordering from Sonic that's actually worth spending for is the slushes! 

I mean, man. Come after 8 p.m. and all the slushes are half off! AND they basically have every flavor of drink. I mean, that slush menu of flavors is huge!! They even have ice slushes with nerds in them for people who really want a sugar high! 

My favorite thing to get is the Strawberry or Watermelon Cream slush. I love the cream slush because they use real ice cream and real fruit in your drink!! Not that it makes it any healthier--but it tastes really good! 

Nothing hits the spot like a slush at night! Grab your favorite flavor and spend the night in sugary paradise!"}
{"text":"Great, fast and super friendly!! Great Blasts!!  Thank you!!  I even changed my order and they had no problem accommodating the changes.  Very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I am sad to say I will probably not be coming to Sonic's again if possible. On the plus side, it is open 24hrs which is very convenient. Located on Flamingo near the strip and by 3 casinos. Palms, Gold Coast & Rio. Service has always been nice & courteous.
The first time I tried their SuperSonic breakfast burrito at this location about 10yrs ago. I fell IN LOVE with it. It has everything except the kitchen sink. Sausage, bacon, eggs, cheese, onions, tomatoes, jalapenos & tater tots. It's pretty hefty too. I've honestly lost count how many times I've had it at this location. I've even gotten others to try it and some really like it too. I can't speak for other locations since this is the Sonic I've patronized 95% of my visits. I've had a couple other items too but the SS breakfast burrito is by far my fave.
Last week near the strip I needed to grab some late night grub. I felt a hankering for an awesome SS breakfast burrito. Initially I thought I got the wrong order since the burritos were considerably smaller than what I've known SSBB to be. Though it turns out that wasn't the case. I had ordered 2 of them. Inside one I found 2 or 3 tater tots, 2 jalapeno slices, a couple diced onions & tomatoes. If not for that I would've thought I got the wrong burritos. There was alot less of all the other ingredients in both of them. Both were roughly 1/2 to 2/3 the size I've known them to be all these years.
I decided to call back and ask the night manager on duty if perhaps my order wasn't done correctly. He explained that the burritos I got were how they were supposed to be made. They had to control rising food costs and were being overstuffed by the kids that work there for a long time. I had just had one there the week before and mentioned that fact. He said they just started correcting things.
Sure, the price has slowly gone up over the years. Which was ok, I was still willing to keep eating them. But I will not be paying $3.19 for an item that's suddenly almost half the size it used to be up til 2 weeks ago."}
{"text":"Today in the drive-thru I ordered some drinks and food. I was quoted around $7 at the screen. I drove up, and then was quoted \"$9.66\" I handed over my card and realized the increase, and just figured I would check my receipt. Then I heard the cashier say \"F*** my life, I just charged her the wrong amount.\" There was discussion inaudible between her and another worker. I waited a few minutes waiting for them to apologize or admit the mistake and refund me. Instead I watched them sticker the receipt to the next bag, throw my receipt in the bag and handed me my bag and card without a word.
I checked my receipt, sure enough $7. I checked my bank account, $9.66.
I got out of my car and informed them they had overcharged me, and they knew it. The other lady helping the cashier just says \"If we overcharged you, we wouldn't have done it on purpose.\" Well I'm not stupid. They both knew they overcharged me. That's why they just threw the bag in the receipt instead of attaching it on the outside of the bag and didn't say a thing. That's just absolutely ridiculous to me. I get it, mistakes happen. Just admit it and fix it, that's totally fine to me. But to not even TRY to fix it and just hope I don't notice, that's astounding to me. I have to give good customer service at my job, I expect the same. Nothing was ever acknowledged, there was no apology. I just got a snarky reply when I brought it up.
Their names were Sade and Serena. I don't know which is which, but either way they both don't give a shit about customer service. Don't bother going to this location, there are way better fast food joints and an awesome drink place called Sodalicious is less than a mile away."}
{"text":"Worst drive-through service ever! I came through the drive-through at about 4 PM today. I ordered a vanilla Heath concrete custard. There was one car ahead of me. After a couple of minutes they got their ice cream and I pulled up to the window. The girl immediately took my credit card and ran it. She handed it back to me, with no receipt. She said I'll be right back. After about 10 minutes of sitting in the hundred degree heat with my window open, and about 10 teenyboppers running around inside of the sonic socializing and not working, she brings me my ice cream (if you can call it that at this point. It was about 3/4 full and The top half was melted and was basically a soup. To top it off I never even got a receipt. I love sonic with their drinks slushes and ice cream's, but I'll never be back to this one. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Visiting from Cali, had a craving for Root Beer float. Been a good while since I had some. Service was great. Place looked great too"}
{"text":"Sonic onion rings are a crime against nature. They are dipped in cake batter or Bisquik or something similarly sugary. For a place that prides itself on having such a wide menu, I cannot believe they screw this pooch so badly and with such little apparent remorse. Bleck."}
{"text":"$10.36×2 chicken sandwhiches!?... let's stick to the cheeseburgers next time or until a special comes out :("}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Sonic at all in my life. I passed by this place in 2009 but now I can say I finally tried it.  It is near the Palms Casino, had the All American Hot Dog and the Coney Island Hot Dog w/ chilli and cheese. It definitely hit the spot at 3:45 in the morning or so.  Even if you walk up and order you can't physically go inside the restaurant, you order from the outside box and the people come to you with your order and you pay cash or credit.  The drink was cool too, the ice was chipped in a different kind of way, so the Sprite tasted like a total slushie.  The handmade Onion Rings tasted unbelieveable also.
I know there are a few Sonic's in Jersey, but I am never really around there but the commercial play all over NY, nah mean. So the word is out there."}
{"text":"Been here before of course, but what ruined this experience, they didn't put our lids to our shakes on tight!  Yeaaaaa!  They went all over the stearing wheel, emergency break, stick shift ect...Ruined exerience!  Check your stuff before you drive!  Accident waiting to happen"}
{"text":"I don't come here too often (even though I do like sonic)  I really was in the mood for a shake and I know they have half price shakes in the evening. So I got a peanut butter fudge shake. 

It was a bit thick (I like my shakes a bit thinner, but that didn't affect my review here, cause that's a personal preference) but it tasted GREAT!  You also can't beat the price.  

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place has such low rating. I have only been to this location four times, each spaced out months in between. Three out of the four times, they have come up to my car with the wrong order. All four times it seems to take an excessive amount of time to be served considering I only ever order one drink. Save yourself the headache and go to the next sonic down the road."}
{"text":"This location gives sonic a bad name, I have never had such bad food. Based on looking at prior reviews the owner and management should be ashamed"}
{"text":"A fine dining establishment. Reccomend the blue powerade slushie.  It is an international delight."}
{"text":"Good quick bite to eat. Open 24 hours."}
{"text":"This is the first Sonic Drive-In i've ever seen in my life despite all the commercials they have on TV. Pretty good service and the food comes quick- i love how the ordering, paying and receiving of food all happens with the customer being inside their parked car! The food was just OK to me- we ordered a cheeseburger, a toaster sandwich (which my friends liked a lot), fries and tater tots. Slushys here are overly sweet! We came during happy hour so all the slushys were half off."}
{"text":"The only actual food items I've had at Sonic are their grilled cheese and fries.  Not the healthiest choice for me to make, but then again, there's not much healthy about Sonic.

Not much healthy, but there's a whole lot of tasty goin' on. I normally go for their desserts- mainly their shakes or ice cream cones.  They're cheap and strangely delicious. 

Plus it's fun to be able to pull up and have the server come out to your car like they did in the olden days."}
{"text":"Super fast service! We don't have a Sonic near us in Michigan, but have to stop for Cherry Lime Aide when in AZ.  So good!  The food is typical greasy fast food, but good options and breakfast is available all day."}
{"text":"Close to home and my \"go to\" for late night sweet tooth and you can't beat Happy Hour from 2-4PM. They also have 99cent large drinks in the morning for your drive to work."}
{"text":"My first time to a Sonic.  Confusing ordering from their outdoor auto/menu.  Three other groups of people asked us how to order, so I know it wasn't just us.  

The food tasted bland... you know it's sad when McDonalds burgers have more flavor.  Over the years, we had seen commercials showing mouth watering food items for Sonic; hahaha good ol' marketing!!!

Also, interesting that the food server did not make eye contact... possibly she was too embarrassed of the product they are selling?  Well, she was on skates... possibly too busy trying to maintain balance."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 42/100***

Prior to Saturday I think I've only visited a Sonic once or twice in California and that was years back. I had dental work earlier that day and thought grabbing a shake from Sonic sounded so good. The shakes are great but I can't say the same for everything else. We ordered a total of 3 combos: Jumbo popcorn chicken with tater tots and banana caramel shake, chicken club toaster with tots and banana shake, sonic cheeseburger with fries and oreo shake. Everything came out to $28+ it's funny that I always get surprised by how expensive fast food is nowadays. I always think afterwards how I could've gotten a better, healthier meal elsewhere hahaha.

Food and service wise, it's 2 stars. Extra star for their shakes that are comparable, if not better than the higher end burger joints and the fact that after 8 pm they're half priced. You can't beat that. I wouldn't come back for their food but their shakes are definitely in the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"I get an ocean water daily . I rarely find a sonic who in my taste makes them up to par. But this sonic has some great mixologist . The strawberry slush with lemon berry is my AZ favorite. I don't stray from ocean water . A full 5 stars would be given if that sun is covered if only some way ...."}
{"text":"Fuck you, sonic. You didn't put the lid on my shake tight and it just spilt all over my carpet! 5 bucks down the drain plus a big mess to clean."}
{"text":"This was my first time that I've been to a Sonics. It was pretty interesting to see the guy bringing the food on roller-skates. We had just eaten, but were passing by, and I wanted to try it. 

We drove up, parked, and ordered from the menu board. It was just our luck. It was happy hour, which meant half price drinks and slushes from 2-5pm everyday. I ordered the Jolly Rancher Green Apple Slush with Pop Rock Candy in it. It was a pretty interesting concept. I've never heard of it before. I took a sip and the Rock Candy was just popping all in my mouth. I loved it, except for that fact that it was so overly sweet. My husband got the Caramel Brownie Blastopia. It's a blended ice cream shake. It was nice and rich, but also very sweet. The last thing we ordered were the onion rings. It was decent. It was fried crispy on the outside. On the inside, it was actually the whole piece of onion rather than chopped up, breaded onion bits.

Service was pretty fast. The lady who took our order was nice. We had some questions, since it was our first time at Sonics. She took her time and answered it for us. The guy who delivered the food was also very pleasant."}
{"text":"I've ordered food and drinks and always received speedy service no matter the time of day. A great location."}
{"text":"I can't say enough just how great they are. I come on the weekends and order 5 slushes and shakes at a time and I know it's a pain but they are always so friendly. I usually hold the line up with my order and they never get them wrong. My children absolutely love Sonic weekends!"}
{"text":"Sonic is known for its Cherry Limeade and it is delish as well as a sugar rush.

In the past I've loved sonic for the nostalgic experience, especially when they come out in roller skates. Food is ok and you can't beat a 50 cent corn dog when that's all your son will eat.

Today my son asked for a burger from Sonic so here we are. I ordered the spicy hot hatch green Chile burger.

Half way through his burger, my son exclaimed, \"daddy, it's spicy hot. Why would they do that??\" And began fanning his mouth, spit out the burger and downed half his slushie.

Note to staff: wash your hands after handling green chiles.

Otherwise, service was ok...had to repeat my order 3 times.

They gave me a refund of $1.69 for the jr cheeseburger, a replacement, and a complimentary slushie. Above and beyond service would have been to take care of the whole bill, but at least they were thoughtful enough to bring a free extra drink."}
{"text":"Sonic noobie.  Always been meaning to try it.  Mcdonalds, bk, carls, i would give all those a 3 for food.  So sonic burgers are really similar to these restaurants.  The beef patties though are much thicker at sonic.  I think Drinks is where its at and the drive in style.  The drive in is cool but during this hot weather i was wishing there were a inside dining area."}
{"text":"Food is marginal.  Love the Cherry Limeaid.  Waiter more worried about online survey than getting us the stuff we need to eat with."}
{"text":"We stopped at this place to get some quick food before work and it literally took 15 min waiting in the drive threw for our food to come out it was ridiculous, not coming here again!"}
{"text":"We stopped in because it was located right next to the gas station and we needed a quick bite to eat. It has been awhile since I have been able to go to a Sonic. I ordered a Chicago hotdog, mozzarella sticks and a limeade. We sat on the patio since it was nice out which was kept rather clean. They brought out food out to us which was nice. It took a long time for the food to come out hence the lack of a star.

The Chicago dog was better than some I have actual had in the windy city. The peppers hidden under the pickle had some kick! The mozzarella sticks where as great as I remember them and let me tell you that you get a lot of those tasty little things. The limeade was okay a bit more watery than slushie. 

I would stop in again if in the area."}
{"text":"It's Sonic I didn't order food I only order cherry limeade... With extra lime! It hit the spot. With every dream in my mind I was singing summertime sit back and Rewind..."}
{"text":"Yea, yea so what, yes I gave it a 4 star. It's the only fast food place open thats serves breakfast and lunch in any hours. This is where I love to stop by after working out 3am. Man i love their breakfast burrito (#12 combo) and their chicken club sandwich. They serve good deserts as well and unlike Jack in the Box or Mcdees, they actually seem happy to serve, or at least they do a good job acting like they do. And oh, their tater tots are very good too. I believe they're drinks are half off, including shakes and other special blends during 5-7. Sonics happy hrs."}
{"text":"Headed home wanted something quick and tastes decent. Let's do Sonic! Bad idea. The intercom to order in drive thru was scratchy and the hard to communicate. 8 min later... we get a delivery but no drink w my combo, no sauce with the chicken dinner. Server had to go back inside.... so going on 10 min.....*waiting*.........
12 min...*waiting*...... (for him to get our coke and sauce)??

15min!?!?! Car behind us left already. 
Boyfriend actually goes inside to ask why there is a hold up w coke and sauce16min... they had no idea about missing items
17.....
18...
Wtf?!?!
Boyfriend goes back and gets my coke physically, they tell him they don't have gravy sauce anymore. Wtf not say that in the beginning, or when the guy dropped off food? 
We aren't even interested in eating despite being hungry because of the experience pissed us off. 

Hire new people or something SONIC! wow"}
{"text":"First time here so wasn't sure what to expect.  I had my window rolled half way up because I thought maybe they would hang a tray with my food on the window like car hop places use to do.  I guess not.  They came out with the tray but food was in a bag and everything was handed through the window.  Guess it makes sense-they don't have to come back out to get the tray and I can leave when I want.

I ordered the New York Dog combo with tater tots and cherry limeade.  Not picture perfect meaning the dog looks bigger in the picture.  I could hardly find it in the bun.  It came with sauerkraut, mustard and raw diced onion.  Although a lot of bun, I have to say it was tasty.  Tatie tots were Krispy and not greasy and lime aid refreshing but the lid was not tight so when I tilted it to take a drink I got a nice surprise with cold liquid down my front.  It costs $6.89an't beat the $1.50 Costco dog and refillable drink.

I noticed they have a breakfast menu served all day.  

For Me this is a once in a long time stop and would not be a first choice unless I wanted one of their signature limeade drinks."}
{"text":"The food is alright but I had to wait 30 mins in the drive thru! That's insane, there was 3 cars ahead of me, and two cars parked. They need to really work on their speed!!"}
{"text":"Well got to say sonics food is good but what got me upset was that I get text from sonic on discounts on food. I got a text saying that on half off shakes after 8pm for this whole summer.  Well when I got thetr around 1am they told me that its only good till 12am I got upset. And the drive thru was really long they should of get the drive thru a little faster or hire more people."}
{"text":"No shame in liking greasy fast food, but this experience was bad, bad, bad. 
I've been to Sonic a handful if times, but not this location so just know that this is not a review of Sonic so much as this particular chain. Also, this may have just been an off day.
All that said however the service was bad. Food was insanely slow and it wasn't busy. I was with 5 coworkers but that shouldn't be a problem for a fast food chain should it? I'm talking 10+ mins for tots and burgers. Then a gripe of all Sonic places their drinks are 10% liquid and 90% ice. I always forte to ask for very little ice. My bad.
They also forgot my milkshake, so I asked if it was on its way. Nope. 20 mins after asking when we were about to leave, \" any word on that milkshake?\" Nope.
Finally a girl comes out, \"sir here's your milkshake...\" Oh well.
Overall their food is a step above McDonalds and Burger King, but it is more expensive so it should be.

Bad form by Sonic in Wexford."}
{"text":"These guys want more money than minimum wage??? They can't even get my order right... worst place ever..."}
{"text":"I don't know how they can stay in business. Food was not good at all and the screwed up the order 3 different ways.

Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Quality of the food is always there! Love that they are open late and they full menu is available at all times. Great shake selections and prices, especially after 8pm. Delicious slush flavor combos."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! I have been wanting to eat Sonic sloppy food for everrrrr!! There isn't one close enough to where I live in LA and when I see the \"Happy Hour\" commercials for the yummy looking drinks I get pissed because I CANT HAVE ONE!! Well folks, I finally got to have an experience at Sonic. Love how the waitress's roller blade up to your car, so 50's! Oh and the food was mmmmhmmmm good :) I had a burger (tasteh!), onion rings (not so great, too sweet) and a strawberry lime aid thingie (the SHIZZY!!). Wish I had some vodka to add to the drink, it would have been HEAVEN. If there was a Sonic near LA, I would try everything on the menu but, since there's not, I will remain a skinny minnie and enjoy when ever I'm in Vegas. Ha."}
{"text":"Great burger and tater tots. I know I can always get a consistently good burger at Sonic. I like how the edges are a bit crisp. Service was good as we sat outside and let the girl on the roller skates come to us. Good shakes and a spicy chicken sandwich. I love the novelty of Sonic but it's not just a gimmick it's plain and simple good burgers."}
{"text":"Love this place. I always get good service here, everyone is super nice. This place has the best cherry limeades!"}
{"text":"This is a great place if you like ice cream, unless you actually want Ice cream. Their machine is always broken! So freaking frustrating as their food and service at this location is shoddy to say the least. We definitely won't be back. Save the frustration and just go to the DQ right down the road!"}
{"text":"My husband went to get the classic coneys special for me and the cheese burger special for him he wanted no cheese on his burger , and he wanted fries , I wanted the special the cony and onion rings when he got home his order was correct mine was not. They had onions on my cony and no onion rings had ff instead. I don't eat ff. And when I called her she said it was made as it was ordered ,  no it was not . We go there a lot since its not far from us but with her attitude and this mix up we probably wont go back"}
{"text":"Pull up to your spot, order your food, and it is brought out to your car. All the while 50's - classic rock tunes are playing over the speaker system. As far as fast food chains go this is one of the better ones. Nothing like feeling a touch of nostalgia of a drive-in joint where you can sit in your car with the windows open in beautiful weather and have the food brought to you. 

Happy hour from 2-4 where all the drinks are half price! Can't beat a Big Gulp sized Grape Slushie and Blue Coconut Slushie for only $1 each! Along with some tastily seasoned popcorn chicken, a ranch chicken wrap, and perfectly crispy tater tots this was a winning quick lunch!

Yum - tater tots!

Seems so seemless here. Pull up, press the red button, place your order, and within minutes it is brought to your car with a smile. If you want to eat outside there are some tables and chairs on a small patio in the front. How can anyone not like this?

Grape slushie....Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Wow this Sonic needs to get it together. The ordering staff I spoke with mumbled her name and I didn't even know if she was ready for me. There were long pauses between everything I asked, for example is there an upcharge for this? 9 seconds. No. Ok... I'd like this. 9 seconds. Ok. And... I'll get this. 11 seconds. Ok what size? Ridiculous.

On top of that the employees cars were taking up the closest spaces. I get they probably want shade for their cars but then just park opposite the building. I pulled up and saw so many empty cars I thought there was something \"bad\" happening, like maybe they parked and all got out to fight or all their orders were wrong and they were on the other side. I have no idea. It was like a ghost town. The response I got was \"we haven't had people complain (about the cars). Yea cause ain't nobody time for that and you're not gonna move them right then so no one would say anything but if it confused me it confused at least 1 other person which is enough for a poor yelp review. That of which they have plenty."}
{"text":"They always have some specials that will lure you in and are worth it. From the Daily afternoon Happy Hour with large flavor drinks (the best is the strawberry limeade for me). Most people come for the Mix-in's or the 

Hot dogs and tater tot's for on the menu this most recent time. As you have time and want to sell in your car definitely use one of the pull-up days in order to place your order sit back and enjoy your food. They do have small outdoor seating for one of the consistent problems is the service always seems to be a little slow

My biggest issue is that the Drive thru line is SO SLOW!!!!

Make sure you signed up via text messages for the alerts as they do have some pretty good specials that come along the lower you right back in. Would recommend sticking to the beverages and the occasional food snack but not necessarily excited about making this my goto spot for a lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Okay, this place really isn't *that* bad.  

Good selection of burgers / sandwiches served on texas toast (!), hot dogs, tater tots (!) and slushies.  The whole \"car service\" is a great novelty.  Pull up into a spot, peruse the menu, push on a button and place your order.  Wait anxiously in your car for your order, watch the servers literally roll out to your car to deliver your food.  Staff was friendly and quick.  Great value, as well.  

Sure, it's not the best place to go to in Vegas. But if you're in the area and need to satisfy your hunger, it'll do..."}

{"text":"I really like that this Sonic is open till 2am unfortunately the sonic near my house was closed its only 11 o'clock and it's a Sunday evening this is Las Vegas who the fork closes before midnight. I would really appreciate it if I didn't have to drive 3&a half miles to go get my dessert fix after spending some private time with my girlfriend but you know for Sonic I'll Drive as far as I have to especially since the truth is I'm sitting in the passenger seat and my girlfriend doing the driving so I can go get the ice cream better yet cuz I spent all my money on the smartphone that I'm giving the review with my girlfriend is paying for the ice cream and she was on top doing the work today so this is pretty cool"}
{"text":"Love the deserts here. And the food isn't half way to bad. Service is prompt. Just double check your order before leaving if it's a big order because they sometimes will forget something in that order"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, all sonics kind of suck but this one is at the top of the list! Either the drive thru speaker is broke or they always have kids that don't know what their doing running it. None of my order was right. The drinks were wrong as well as the food."}
{"text":"Not super busy, but not super slow either, but my food took like 10 minutes to come out. Even then the sauce i got on my boneless wings was wrong. But i always give second chances with places unless they are really horrible, so I just kept the wrong ones. My tots were a little cold as well. For someone who works in food, maybe they were understaffed, had somebody new working etc. Hopefully the second time i come it will be better. The guy who brought out my food was really polite. And to the guy complaining about allergies, why would you choose to eat at a fast food place if they are really that bad?"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice in the month of February, and they are awesome! The employees have been super friendly and always all smiles. The employees make the experience great. I will be recommending this place to everyone who visits buckeye."}
{"text":"Have no idea what their doing. 20 min drive thru. People honking behind me it's taking sooooooo long!!!  Wow, really?"}
{"text":"Killer shakes/malts/slushies, great burgers and dogs, an endlezs supply of drink combinations.  I like a simple Coke with lime, your standard burger, and some 'tater-tots with cheese.  But, I also dig the cheese sticks, melts, breakfast items and cherry limeaids."}
{"text":"Excellent service from the young lady working tonight! Thanks sonic!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times, and it's usually a rather uneventful affair. I've found the service to be acceptable in regards to timeliness and employee demeanor. Although they offer a rather wide variety of sandwiches, hot dogs, and miscellaneous add-ons, to me Sonic will always be about the tater tots and exotic drinks or slushies. 

I go here several times a year, although sometimes dining in your car can get a bit awkward. There is a small outdoor area where you can eat, but Vegas weather doesn't always make that an inviting option."}
{"text":"I'm trying to locate the Sonic Drive In at Guadalupe on Arizona Av (country club) chandler.......I'm not surprised that they aren't listed here,,,probably  cause others experience were as awful as mine.
I have patronized this location 3 times in the past year.AND I WILL NEVER RETURN AGAIN....EVERYTHING I ORDERED WAS INCORRECT ... $ 23.00 TO FEED 3 KIDS.  NO MORE..I when did wacky wednesday  half price go away or were we charged full price by error.  I mentioned it when I ordered with no reply .  I think I'd like to speak with the owner on this. I will travel 7 MI south and go to that location..never had a problem thete ."}
{"text":"Service was really fast and the blizzards were great but the bananas in the banana split were a bit too ripe.  Still a good experience., though."}
{"text":"If I could give zero starts I would. I came with my boyfriend at around 2:10 am and pulled through the drive through. The cashier immediately asked for a moment before taking our order which we were okay with. When she soon asked if we were ready, we asked for another minute or two to look over the menu, as I have bad vision. The cashier complied, and about a minute later she says rather impatiently, \"what can I get started for you?\" We were pretty annoyed by the unnecessary sense of urgency with no one in line behind us, and before we can get an answer out she says VERY rudely, \"WHAT? Are you not READY yet?\" I don't know what kind of place lets their employees talk to guests this way, but sadly that was only the second strike. We proceeded to ask for the Wild Berry Blast to which we were interrupted and told that the ice cream machines were down, which seems absurd in all of the times I've visited this location. Definitely work on the service because I won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Miss Linda is a Doll - such a good woman. They overcharged us and she noticed and came out like 3 times in the hot heat just to correct that for us - shes the best!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  I'd like to give it 5 stars but due to the lack of a drive thru and overwhelming business it's a bit slow.   The place is packed.  

Food is great and we got a lot. 
2 diet limeades (great)
1 fruit fizz (great)
3 corn dogs (great)
1 new hatch chili burger (AWESOME!!!)
2 large fries (great)

I'll probably come by again if in this part of town and try when it's not the crazy busy happy hour. 

OVERALL GREAT FOOD AND DRINKS"}
{"text":"No the biggest fan of fast food.  But when I'm in the mood this is the best for breakfast and lunch.  They have great prices, fast service and the food is always tasty.  This location is always clean and friendly too.  Located right across the dryer from the Palms casino."}
{"text":"Love coming here for the limeades and burgers.  They have a great breakfast too.  It's nice to come to a \"old school\" drive up and get served at your window type place.  Love it"}
{"text":"whenever i am in Vegas i stop at this particular Sonic location, not sure if its because of the late night specials or because its right by the Cannery but there is something sentimental about it.

Anyway; this is the only Sonic burger i know of that has late night whacky specials like 50 cent burgers or 50 cent corn dogs. Its usually during certain times of the month and probably something that the franchise does on occassion but nonetheless, i have not seen any other Sonic Burger do it. Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Until moving to Arizona from California, Sonic was a big mystery to me and my husband. For some odd reason, there were always commercials for the drive-in chain on local networks. The commercials were always funny in a dry sort of way, and we were interested enough to go look up the closest location, which was 40+ miles from our house. This seemingly pointless marketing strategy was something that a lot of Californians apparently noticed because some person started a Facebook group called \"All I ever see is commercials for Sonic, and I don't believe it actually exists.\" Needless to say, the group had many members join in a very short time. 

Last weekend, we had some friends come in from California for the weekend. They were staying at the Arizona Grand Resort and noticed this Sonic location across the street. Having also seen the commercials and up until this point having decided that the chain didn't really exist, they were super-excited to go experience what Sonic was all about. So, we pulled into one of the parking spots on a Saturday afternoon and decided to sample some of their many interesting drinks. We chose:

*Mocha Java Chiller
*Root Beer Float
*Fried Ice Cream Blast
*Butterfinger Blast

We each had a favorite, which worked out a lot better than continuing to pass them around the car (our original plan). Personally, I thought the classic Root Beer Float was the best, although the Mocha Java Chiller was pretty good and reminded me of a coffee milkshake. We paid $11 or so for the four drinks and had a pretty good time sitting in the car (with the AC blasting of course), sipping our cool treats, and reminiscing about the good old days in America when people knew each other by name and \"petted\" at drive-in movies and eateries. 

Ok, maybe not the last part, but it was a fun afternoon activity after a long day at the hotel pool and now our friends can go back to California knowing that Sonic really does exist. As for us, doubt we'll be back frequently - at least not for the food, which I hear isn't great. The mystery of Sonic's existence has been solved and the mystery was part of what made us want to go there so much in the first place. Hmmm, maybe that's their marketing strategy. I figure if every person in any other state who sees the commercials and then travels to another state where they do have Sonics everywhere stops in and gets just one slush or blast, that's a lot of customers!"}
{"text":"For a chain, Sonic had intrigued me for quite a while prior to this Memorial Day weekend, T.J. and Peter, the company's quirky suburban middle-class duo of pitchmen capturing my attention and causing me to crack a smile many times whilst channel-surfing. On numerous occasions, I've come close to stopping over to this location, the one nearest to me, but never did. Perhaps I subconsciously knew I'd be let down.

T.J. and Peter sadden and disturb me now. I just cannot fathom why someone, even in a supposedly humorous situation, would devote their spare time to such a place. It defies logic and requires a suspension of disbelief that is too great to hold for long.

Sonic's intercom-based ordering system is novel and expedient, and we had no problems to speak of with the service. The majority of the carhops look to be recruited from the local high school's football, basketball, track, and wrestling teams. Damn, were these guys were clean-cut, fit, and disciplined! I couldn't figure out which one was a quarterback. Each time they came out with an order, it seemed as if they were jogging onto a field for a down.  Regardless, they were not the archetypal fast-food employees. I was waiting for one of them to yell \"Ten Hut!\" 

And no, none of them were on rollerblades or skates. 

Interestingly enough, Sonic offers the entirety of their menu all day, meaning you can have a breakfast burrito for dinner or a cheesesteak sandwich for breakfast while sitting in your car...making a mess on your dashboard, on your shirt, your jeans...

Yeah, we could have benefited from some window trays. Not ever having been to a Sonic Drive-In before, I naively expected that. Not that there weren't tables and chairs on their patio, but Kay wanted to \"eat-in.\" Beholden to her will and whims am I. Sonic was her idea for Sunday evening dinner, by the way. 

I also assumed that beverage refills were on the house. Nope. 'Tis a pity for the lightly tart 'n bubbly Limeade washed down all of my food pleasantly and was a cool change-up from the standard soft drinks. 

Of course I ordered a burger, you knuckleheads! And it wasn't duff in any way, Sonic's SuperSonic Bacon Double Cheeseburger arriving squarely between that which Wendy's and Steak 'N Shake hath foisted onto the public. The patties were thin and cooked French style meaning they were as crispy as they were succulent. The foil envelopes that housed them were a nifty wrinkle. 

The hot dog (I wanted to try everything!), on the other hand, was a sub-Circle K failure. Only the steamed bun partially uplifted this \"All-American Dog\" from suicidal depression. 

Skipping french fries, I opted for some tater tots, and these oversalted plugs of spud were no better than any I've yanked out of a supermarket freezer. 

Dessert was an exercise in mixed results. The Fudge Brownie Molten Cake Sundae was topped with what was some of the very best soft serve ice cream ever to spew from a churning machine, at least in the world of franchises. Approaching a custard or gelato, I was completely taken aback with its richness and smooth texture. The level of butterfat had to be off the graph. Lord Almighty. The rest of the sundae was mostly upstaged by the ice cream, though. The cake and hot fudge possessed nowhere near enough umph to counter that ice cream. The ice cream and the whipped cream (dull in this instance) are intended to cut the decadence of the chocolate in these types of sundaes, but the chocolate was so timid, I wished I'd just ordered some of the ice cream in a cup by its lonesome. 

One final issue I have with this Sonic is the lack of signage. I anticipated seeing some massive, retro-futurist logo slowly rotating in the pale early evening blue yonder. Instead, we just happened upon what came off as a half-finished Sheetz after driving around a shopping plaza for several minutes attempting to find it. 

T.J. and Peter need to spend more time at home with their families, get out of the sticks every so often, and try some independent restaurants. I can no longer laugh at their commercials. Their banality has finally dawned on me. 

P.S. This Sonic is right across the road from the bar/club known as RPM's. Ironically, the first time I ever went to RPM's (does anything ever go on over there anymore?) my female friend and I were advised not to bother going to Sonic by our bartender who told us it was nothing exciting. This was about 4 years ago. 

P.P.S. Did you know that Sonic has its own radio station? It's as MOR as you may imagine. Don't bother with requests for techno, underground hip-hop, punk, or heavy metal, but if you're a Katy Perry fan, maaan, have you found a home. 

P.P.P.S. Jerry's Curb Side in Bridgewater,PA does the same thing Sonic does but with somewhat superior food, and as far as I know, Jerry's has yet to expand.

P.P.P.P.S. Ed Grimley would surely be a Sonic fan. Headquarters needs to talk to Martin Short about a reprisal of the role."}
{"text":"This location is just ok.  The food we got was ok, but the service was terribly slow. When paying was asked twice if I gave him a $10 bill. He had to use a calculator to make change. It's not the easiest location to get in and out of. Inly went here cause kids wanted to go here."}
{"text":"Awesome pineapple slush! Asked employee Pedro many questions about making it & he was nice & polite & explained the process. He never got upset! Very good employees!"}
{"text":"I only discovered Sonic about a year ago, my boyfriend introduced it to me. I was missing out on Sonic for all that time! Hands down one of the best fast food places around. The menu is large and everything I have tried is delicious, even their dollar menu burgers are very tasty and good for a small meal or to fill up on their amazing onion rings or mozzarella sticks. Everything is SO reasonably priced! My favorite order has to the be the Bacon Cheeseburger Toaster meal with a Watermelon Slush and Tots (instead of fries). YUM!! I also find that when the Vegas heat is at its most brutal, a Route 66 fruit slush is the perfect thing to cool down on. It's 66 ounces of cold, sweet goodness. I must point out the Sonic Blast. You can get the Junior Candy Sundae size for $1, or a regular sized one. It is so good, but let it be known that the regular size is so filing it's like a meal just in itself.

This particular Sonic always has good service as well. Quick, accurate orders with friendly workers. Sonic also has happy hour EVERYday 2-4pm where drinks are half off. One thing I like is that you can take it to go, eat in your car, or also eat outside on benches in front of the establishment. If you haven't tried Sonic, it's time."}
{"text":"I've come to this Sonic many times, they've usually done pretty well.  This morning was an exception. My wife and I ordered breakfast.  She got a breakfast toaster, which on the menu looks like a breakfast sandwich made with Texas toast.  Well hers was regular sliced bread that was flattened as much as you can flatten bread and sloppily made.  My breakfast burrito was also a sloppy mess with the outside of the wrapper with messy cheese.  My wife said, \"At least they were fast.\"  I'd rather wait a minute or two extra for a better quality meal."}
{"text":"I mostly come to Sonic for the slushies.  My kids love them especially in the summer and they're half off from 2pm to 4pm. However this Sonic managed to get my two drink order wrong.  I had to repeat my order more than 3 times and when I got to the window she had to confirm it yet again.  It was a blue raspberry with nerds (for my 6 year old) and a blue coconut for myself. After I received my order and drove away from the window I took a sip and realized she put nerds in mine as well.  It totally ruined the whole thing.  It was frustrating cause I couldn't go back and fix it because I had somewhere to be.  Wish there was one closer to my home cause I really don't want to go back to this one."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this Sonic I have a ridiculous wait and because of that I received 2 tokens for two cherry limeades or any other soft drink.....So here I am again today just had a 15 min wait and when they finally got to me I asked if I could substitute one of the tokens for a small slush? And the manager said no! It was for my little 3 year old, I figured it's happy hour and a small slush is cheaper then a med. drink plus the ridiculous 15 min wait, it wouldn't be a problem...... Guess I was wrong! Great management and customer service!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is decent here. The Slushes are what draws me here for the most part, and every now and then I get a craving for a shake. Having said that, and the primary reason for the two star review and nothing higher is the service. I get it, it's fast food, and yes, I've been a fry cook, a pizza builder, and a burger slinger in my high school days, so I understand that kids are drawn to working here. But...I expect some professionalism. I don't expect to hear teeny boppers swearing inside the booth. I also don't expect to be argued with by said teenager when they mess up my order. Just fix it so we can both keep it moving!!
Lastly, and hopefully people that work here and other fast food joints read this....when I order 2 Medium and 2 Large orders of tots, and then ask you for Ketchup, handing me 4 packets is not acceptable. Granted, I don't watch or read the news religiously, but last time I checked, there wasn't any global shortage of Ketchup. Please don't make me tell you that I need 16 Ketchups. A little common sense goes a long way :o)"}
{"text":"Sonic inside the Walmart. I try to stay away from fast food in the first place so you get what you pay for. 

The initial impression of the place is mediocre as the place is neither clean nor overly dirty. There are random straw papers and napkins on tables and the floor from customers that have opened straws and left their wrappers or wiped down the table.

Someone quickly took my order and by the time I was done paying for my order my 4 slushy drinks were already made which was a plus. Food didn't take much longer, maybe 5-6 minutes and was actually made to order and correct but the customer service at this location sucks. I wasn't greeted at beginning of order, cashier didn't ask if there was anything else I would like to add to my order, nor did the person handing over my order show any enthusiasm in thanking me for my order. She placed my order on the counter with her head down and walked away. Didn't even call out my order. I guess she assumed I knew it was mine since there weren't many others there at the time and I was actually standing there waiting. 

All in all the location did good in delivering good food but their customer service needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"The ease of ordering outside is great but the customer service, lack of speed, and attention to detail is poor. When ordering, the male rushed our order. After every single item we ordered the male would ask, \"would that be all?\" It just made the process longer. Waiting for our FIRST set of food didn't take that long but we ended up having to wait even longer than the first time for missed fries and burger. We asked for no topping on our milkshake yet it still came with toppings. Though all this the lady whom brought our food out never once apologized for the wait or errors. We never asked to be compensated for their mistake but that would have been a great time to say, \"I apologize we made your shake wrong, let me remake it while you wait for your missed burger and fries.\" or at least just remake the shake in general. Neither of those happened. Not the best place to go when you're in somewhat of a time crunch."}
{"text":"Once again the drink machines are broken do much for the 1000s of different drinks you can get. Don't come here 50/50 anything works."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly. The food was terrible. Burger and fries tasted old and were cold."}
{"text":"Don't come here as often but its been pretty hot so, I really needed a slushy to cool me down, lol. I will be going back to get another when Happy Hour starts too. Had a grape slushy, gulp it down it down in minutes. Didn't know that Ice wasn't free but its the crushed ice that I like the Best only a few joints offer this type of ice. So I'll pay for it if that's a requirement."}
{"text":"The night crew is way better than the morning crew! I enjoy the fudge chocolate shake! And the tots are delicious! Ask for sonic sauce!"}
{"text":"Drove 20 minutes for a banana split, that we were rudely told \"uhm we don't have those anymore, haven't had them in a long time.\" Okay that's fine, I then order a hot fudge sundae ask for nuts, \"Uhm we don't serve nuts anymore\". On the menu it states \"ask for nuts\". The employees were just flat out rude. Never will I return here."}
{"text":"I've given this Sonic about a year's worth of chances, mainly because it is right next to my apartment complex,  but no more! This is the worst sonic. Whether you're in the drive thru (sometimes a 30 minute wait), or you park, the service is incredibly slow. 8/10 they get the order wrong, or just dont bring you what you've ordered. They never seem to be able to hear you when ordering either, I literally have to scream my order and half the time they still can't hear me. Ordering cheese on anything? The only time it's actually melted is when it's on the side of the container. And....whoever the manager is, they suck as a human being. He pulled a worker out of the building,  brings her right up next to my car (windows down) and berates her for not having the right pants on for the day. This goes on for 5 minutes, she's nearly in tears....it didn't have to happen the way it did. So unprofessional! You lost a customer."}
{"text":"This place is classic!

Finally a warm day to take a ride with the top down.  (wasn't Thursday nice after the long winter?)  So I want to Sonic for Happy Hour.   Yes, Sonic has Happy Hour were drinks are 1/2 off.  lol

Also, had to decide should I dine on the Patio or in the car?  Patio? Car? Patio? Car?  Finally chose the car.  But Sonic has a patio with umbrella tables.

Ordered the Chicago dog that came on a warm poppy seed bun..must have been in a steamer and was fresh.  The dog can with a couple of whole sport peppers, celery salt and the usual Chicago Dog stuff...very enjoyable.

Who needs Poutine when you can go to Sonic and get Tots (tater tots) with cheese or with cheese and chili sauce?!?!  Chili sauce was so so, as were the Tots.  

You can get milk shakes with real ice cream or soda's.  Decided on the root beer float...Yum!

Car hop was real nice.  The manager walked around twice to make sure your order had been taken and to see if you needed anything.

Last year stopped by and they had a couple of car hops on roller skates.  Car hop today said that a couple car hops still do skate but not working today.

Fun place to try and have a good burger, dog, milk shake, float.  

May want to go elsewhere for Poutine!"}
{"text":"AAAwwww.  Happy Hour!  Sonic is the Ultimate Drink Stop.   Missed lunch and was starved and noticed Sonic...Oh yeah!  It was Happy Hour!  Had the Bacon Cheeseburger and it was cooked perfectly, not a thin patty that most fast food places use and so tasty.   Sonic burgers and fries are pretty good.   Had some fries and the fries are OK.

For Happy Hour I enjoyed the LIme Limeade.  Delicious!

Fun place to visit in nice weather!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped there today. We rang the order button and waited for 5mins and no one took our order or even told us that they would be with us in a min. We could see two employees standing inside just talking and leaning on a counter. So we started walking away and one lady started yelling at us over the loud speaker to wait and she would take our order, but they were super short staffed. We were a little embarrassed we had to stand there like fools in front of a lot of other people waiting, and then the fact that she had to yell at us over the speaker after we walked away. Never going back again."}
{"text":"This visit to Sonic at this location was THE WORST experience ever! My order was very simple: an extra long chill cheese coney and a large drink. The car hop brought out the wrong order (a combo meal). I sent the order back. They canceled the order (told me that I'd be refunded in 5 to 7 business days) and that I'd have to purchase a new 'correct' order. I asked for a manager who did nothing at all. I left Sonic with nothing but a $6 charge (until 5 to 7 business days). This took up 30 minutes of my time for NOTHING!
 
I contacted Sonic's customer service. Now, I'm waiting another 24 to 48 hours for a response. This is such an inconvenience!"}
{"text":"Usually the food is fantastic and the service is great.  The blonde manager always seems to run the restaurant the best."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 rootbeer floats and they gave us a blended root beer float and a large rootbeer. We corrected the order w the young man but he ended up just putting ice cream on top of the rootbeer, which had more ice then soda... never returning to this location.. such a simple order, and there were no other customers mind you"}
{"text":"My expectations weren't very high for Sonic. Let's face it,  they're not known for high quality food. 
This particular Sonic is dirty. When you enter the lobby as I did on this visit,  you're hit with a very unpleasant smell coming from the in ground mat at the door. It actually causes the entire lobby to stink. All around the lobby debris can be seen. The seats of the booths are all dirty,  with old food and dirt on them. The tables are dirty as well. 
The cashier was pleasant. The food was below (already low)  expectations. 
The single onion ring that came with the chicken finger box appeared to have been dropped on the floor,  stepped on and then placed in the box. The breakfast burrito was loaded with griddle grease. 
It's obvious that there is little pride taken in this establishment. The staff are typical fast food workers. Apathetic and just going through the motions. 
I blame management for the glaring problems at this \"restaurant\". Maybe a relaunch with new staff is in order. At least replace the management."}
{"text":"charged 50 cent for buffalo sauce and barely fills 1/4th of the little souffle cup - I paid 50 cents for not even enough sauce for my small pop corn chicken. 

the machines never work to pay - have to wait for them to take your card, which takes longer.

tator tots are grease filled

I usually dont review somewhere until ive been there 3 times and nothing changes."}
{"text":"I had never eaten at Sonic before. However, I've seen their ads on TV all the time growing up in Hawaii even though they don't have any restaurants there. I never got around to eating at one while visiting the mainland either until now and I must say I'm glad I never did. The jalapeño burger was lousy, the hot dog wasn't any better, the tater tots were okay, and the slushy drink was good. My friend told me that this particular restaurant is probably a bad seed and the food was much better in Texas, Oklahoma, and other southwestern states he's eaten Sonic at. I'll give a shot again but not at this location. I'm giving 2 stars because the lady at the drive through window was very nice and helpful to curious first timers who didn't know what to order and took forever to decide. Good thing no one was behind us in the drive through! Food was definitely a 1 star though."}
{"text":"This place is not good. I ordered a water and a slushy. They normally come out and give you your drinks have you pay and your on your way. But this day they helped three cars behind us and we were still two cars from the window. A women got out of the truck in front of us and really let them have it which they fully deserved. The man with the pony tail in the blue shirt slammed the door in her face then the window later in the encounter. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. We waited almost 20 minutes our stuff was half melted and they wouldn't help us only the people behind us. A different guy apologized and gave us a free drink when we got to the window but the guy with the pony tail just stayed with an attitude. I can't believe they acted like that, get new employees."}
{"text":"I love sonic drinks!  Vanilla ice tea to all the flavors you can create your own soda. They have happy hour for drinks and slushes in the afternoon and discounted shakes in the evenings."}
{"text":"Good sonic experiences. I love sonic drinks, so i visit frequently. My order is always right and the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Peanut Butter Cookie milkshake was unbelievable. I like how the server came out to my car in drive thru lane to deliver shake and take payment so that I could move ahead of those with larger orders."}
{"text":"I am normally not a fan of reviews of uber-chains like this (does the quality of McNuggets really vary from McDonald's to McDonald's?) but I feel the need to highlight this place because a) the pickins are slim for reviews of stuff on the west side outside the Westgate or Arrowhead areas; b) I'm not really reviewing the quality of the food; and c) it must be noted that Sonic is open until midnight (also rare for this area, apparently).

After a late dinner the BF and I headed back across town to his neighborhood.  Around 11pm I started craving ice cream.  After a few internet searches I found that most dessert places in this area were long closed.  Not feeling like resorting to the McDonald's soft serve (have I really just dropped their name twice in one review?) I kept searching.  Finally, I found Sonic and checked to make sure they were still open (tick tock, it's now 11:32pm).  Joy!  They are open until the clock strikes twelve AND they have a decent selection of desserts.  

Cut to the drive-thru where I order their version of a Blizzard (switching up the fast food references) that can even be chocolate-flavored.  Hooray!  My night has been saved!  I return home, scarf down some tasty chocolate ice cream goodness and then fall asleep on the couch watching \"Bad Boys.\"  What more could a girl ask for?"}
{"text":"Ok so first of all the speakers don't work well so after you have repeated yourself numerous times you then get the wrong food! Then I get my food simple order all American dog meal and my husband coney dog meal 
My hot dog was old and rubbery the fries old like come on guys! It's hot dogs! I didn't order anything fancy! Don't sell old hot dogs you've had sitting on your hot dog warmer from this morning to people that show up for dinner! 
Change them! We pay money to eat here stop selling us old fries! Would you wanna eat them? No! So don't sell them to anyone else!!"}
{"text":"I was stranded while getting my car repaired next to Sonic today, since I had 1.5 hour wait I decided to have a quick meal there. This was my first visit to Sonic and I'm sure it'll be my last. The service was  good, but food was absolutely on the top of my crappy fast food joint list. The chicken sandwich tastes like a processed breaded chicken patty, I took one bit and threw the remaining sandwich in the trash. The only reason why this  place gets a star is that the site requires it."}
{"text":"Giving one star because I couldn't give none. After repeating order four times we get to the window and they charge us incorrectly. Had to wait a few minutes for error to be corrected and then told it would be 3 days for credit to go back on card. No apology or anything from the girl that messed up everything. Should have listened to other reviews.  All we ordered was 3 ice creams.  And you want $15 an hour."}
{"text":"Stop here for lunch often. I usually go through the drive-thru. This time I opted to park and eat. The person (lady) on the speaker was nice, got my order correct etc... I waited approx 15bminutes for my food (grilled chicken sandwich, tots add cheese and a side of jalapeños... One medium diet cherry lime aide). The lady who brought my food out apologized for the wait and was very friendly...The neighborhood is decent, sonic is sandwiched in between to car repair shops."}
{"text":"My subordinate and I decided to walk to this sonics from our office and boy was that a big mistake.  It was a lot farther on foot than we thought.  Many times we wanted to turn back, but we kept on going.  We wanted to use our coupons.  Half way there my coworker needed to use the loo, but there was none around, to far the turn around and still no where near the location, so he used the tree instead. 

Once we made it, we were starving from the walk.  It was a good 20 minute walk.  We ordered a big long hotdog with chilli on it, some sodas, and some tater tots.  The food is average.  The service was slow and the staff gave us a hard time when we tried to use our coupons.  Just take it, they're legit.  

Overall a decent experience, nothing special, we decided not to walk back to the office, the chilli beans were going on effect...so we called our supervisor to pick us up."}
{"text":"I ordered a breakfast burrito which costs $2.69. The picture shows a yummy burrito but what I received was awful. A dry portion of eggs, a tiny bit of cheese and bacon. It wasn't even wrapped like a burrito, just sloppy. No flavor. Not worth the money by a long shot."}
{"text":"This drive through is always busy no matter what time of day I come here. Their card reader is always up and running and they never jack up my order so that is nice. The staff here is decent as well."}
{"text":"I have been to this Sonic several times and more often than not their credit card system is down. The problem is once you pull in the drive thru you are stuck. So you dont get the treat you wanted and you have to sit there. So annoying. So the moral of the story is, if you come to this Sonic make sure you have cash or it is a waste of your time."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to go to Sonic because of their awesome, funny and mouth watering commercials. This summer was my first time going to Sonic, which ended up being a regular hot spot for my boyfriend and I. No where else can you pull up, order food, have the food delivered to you and not pay a dime for service. And the service is wonderful! The staff have always friendly and helpful and are nearby if you need extra sauce or straws. The prices are wonderful and the food is good. I don't care for the hot dogs- the meat tastes cheaper than most other hot dogs, though their burgers are really yummy! I was not impressed by the slushies at all! Mine was made of ice that was impossible to slurp up, making my slushy experience less than desirable! The milkshakes are wonderful and there is even an extra small option you can order at a low cost so that you can sample several of their many flavors. There is a walk in bathroom in the building and a patio area where you can eat outside if you don't want to sit in your car in the heat or would prefer to relax outside. I really like it outside to eat to enjoy the weather and because there is just the perfect amount of room! You don't feel squished at all! I would definitely recommend Sonic as one of the number one fast food places out there to go to due to their food quality, service and their unique drive in experience!"}
{"text":"The food is good (for fast food) and I go here regularly.  Sonic, in general, is one of my favorite places.  The down side at this location (and I probably should dock a couple more stars) is that almost half of the time they screw up my order over the past 2 years since moving here.  I have called a few times about it and management is pretty uninvolved (I get an apology but after 2 years of it they are obviously not fixing the issue).  At this point I don't leave the window until I have opened everything and tasted all of the drinks (yes, they mess these up frequently, too)."}
{"text":"Order is wrong. I asked for plain chicken sandwich it has everything and taste like rubber. Don't visit or tip this location"}
{"text":"I don't eat fast food very often but when I do it is here.  Went today for tater tots and a grilled cheese.  I was very surprised at how pleasant the young man was at the window.  He actually made me smile because he was cheerful and smiling.  Good job Sonic!  I wish I had got his name so he could be acknowledged.

I could eat Tater Tots every single day and there are only a few places that you can get them so as long as Sonic has them they will be my go to place for when I don't bring my lunch to work."}
{"text":"How many times do I have to repeat my order. It's on the speaker and in person?  They did get it right finally and comped what was missing the 2nd  time."}
{"text":"I have to say that when I am craving chili cheese fries and tater tots this is the place I hit up.  I am a sucker to all the topping on the hot dogs so I still have not tried all the different ones,  I also like the chili cheese fries here.  
The tator tots are usually on the salty side, but just right for me....I could almost stuff some in my shorts for later, like Neapolitan Dynamite.  
My daughter loves the slushies and she is more of a food critic than me.  I guess I like the drive in look, wish they would encourage car meetups for old cars, that would be cool and fit the theme?  
Its good fast food that is not the \"norm\" hamburger and fries.  Try something different, try Sonics."}
{"text":"Wouldn't even give one star!!! The wait for drive through is always really long. It took me 20 minutes to get an order of small tater tots."}
{"text":"For a massive fast food chain Sonic is the lesser of evils. I occasionally visit for a chili cheese dog with extra onions and mustard - and maybe a grape cream slush. I prefer their Scottsdale location because you can dine inside."}
{"text":"I'm a long time fan of Sonic. Just the drink possibilities are awesome. I recommend a Watermelon Limeade (that's a limeade with watermelon flavoring) or a chocolate coke. 

U can never go wrong with tots (with or without chili/cheese/onions) - they are way better than any french fry ever concocted! The \"new\" hot dogs they have here are pretty tasty. I had a Chicago-style dog, and it was piping hot with a snappy casing as you bit into it. I'm not gonna abandon a true Vienna Beef dog joint for them - but it's nice to know they are almost as good! Maybe next time I stop in I'll see if they can do a foot long this way - that would be awesome, although there won't be a poppy seed bun involved, and that's a shame. 

Sonic, are you listening?? You could create AND corner a market with footlong ChiDogs - but you gotta have the poppy seed buns!!

Check their add-on list - you can add a lot of things (including green chile and jalapenos) to just about anything, and that is just one more bonus that sets Sonic apart from the rest of fast-food corporate America.

One of my fave things about Sonic is that the carhops rollerskate - alas - even Sonic seems to be slacking off on this. It should be required to have ALL hops on skates. I do give them props for hiring people that can actually count change correctly! It's hard to find a waitress or cashier these days that can subtract $9.91 from $20 in their heads. Sonic is keeping mathematics alive!"}
{"text":"Went to sonic to grab a quick bite tonight. Very friendly and efficient.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I drove to sonic on occasion to grab some mozzarella sticks or just to have one of the famous slushes. At this location here are a lot of people hanging around and sometimes by standers who walk up to your car. Over all the service is great, but the food is not always fresh"}
{"text":"Went there a year ago & haven't been back since- food was forgettable, service was barely there, but they make sure to put a religious verse on your receipt to remind you what's obviously more important to this company than training their employees & customer service"}
{"text":"Slowest Sonic in the world...the WORLD. Bad management or something. Honestly idk why it's so bad."}
{"text":"Wish I could give them 0 stars. Just waited for 18 minutes for a root beer float,  until I finally went inside and got it myself (since I already paid for it). I then realized it was only filled up half way with root beer,  the rest was all foam. I called the main office to inform them of my delayed service and the customer service rep was miserable .... not apologetic at all and made me decide to never go to any sonic again. Great job Sonic.... don't even know how you're in business."}
{"text":"Screwed up another order. Why do I trust you guys? I have to learn to stop coming here."}
{"text":"Been to many Sonic restaurants before, so I knew what I wanted before I was even at the call button . . . 2 chicago dogs / large onion ring / medium limeade.

Boy what a disappointment . . . the hot dog buns were so soggy that on the first bite, everything fell out and left me a relish and mustard mess . . . the rings weren't any better, soggy and the onion still tasted raw . . . well at least there was the limeade . . . where's the lime, tasted like sprite.

Will definitely not be back to this Sonic . . ."}
{"text":"chili cheese fries. cheap cheap! chili dogs were too salty but their limeade was spot on even in the cold snowy weather. Services, like most fast food places in Ohio, were uber slow. The staff did apologize for the wait and ask us if we need anything else when they delivered our food but seriously painfully slow. I don't think i'd ever crave Sonic but if I wanted some solid cheap chili fries this is where i'd be."}
{"text":"VERY SLOW service through the drive-thru at this one, unlike most other Sonics.  Food is average, like all the other Sonic chains.  If you are not in a huge hurry and are craving Sonic, go for it if you are driving past on hwy 74.  It's no different than the dozens of other Sonic chains around the area, except the often slow service.  I have been there several times since I live close, and about 80% of the time it is way slower than it should be to get some food.  If it's busy at all (i.e. More than 1 car in the drive thru), then stay away! You have been warned. :)"}
{"text":"We both had \"Chicago style\" hot dogs, I had onion rings , she had fries and we both had shakes, I had the wildberry/lavender, and she had chocolate.
The favorable:
the fries were freshly cut and the rings were of like quality, the shakes were thick and real ice cream.  You order at your own squawk-box and your food is brought to your vehicle or the patio based on from whence the order was placed. Red-striped mints, and ketchup packets accompany one's order.
The less favorable:
McDonald's has Ronald, Wendy's has ...well, Wendy and Chicago style dogs have NEON green relish.....But not here! They have the tiny peppers, onions etc, strips of dill pickles.  If I don't glow in the dark for at least 3 hours after dining I have NOT had a Chicago dog!
The guy that mixes the shakes has no idea what he is doing. A chocolate shake ISN'T 1/3 vanilla then 1/3 chocolate then 1/3 vanilla, the same goes for the wildberry/lavender, and the middle,(flavored) third should taste at least vaguely like the advertised flavor....it did not.
Though needed desparately, napkins did not accompany the meal, but did arrive when requested, as did salt.
As sloppy as the dogs were, a Wet-Nap was every bit as necessary as when one is served ribs, but alas was not provided.
Service was polite and cheery.
Back in the day, in baseball when one swung hard but missed the encouraging comment was \"Nice cut!\", so \"Nice cut\", Sonic!"}
{"text":"ALERT!!!
My husband and his friend had a foot long chili dog yesterday and both of them got sick.  My husband had a somach pain and nausea all night, he couldn't sleep at all.  I'm not sure the food was old or it's a food poisoning.  Hope he will feel better soon but today is a super bowl night."}
{"text":"She read the order back and did it well.  We would prefer that they make frings (onion rings mixed with fries). That would be better. They did give us mints which Rissa and Ethan were very impressed with.   Food was hot but we got one tot when it should have been a fry. Tings would be nice too. (Tots and rings)"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best but when you are hungry and too lazy to drive anywhere else give this place a try."}
{"text":"Decent Sonic experience. I got the Bacon Cheeseburger Toaster (with no lettuce, tomato, or chopped onion), fries, and a Cherry Limeade. The burger was as expected, however the fries weren't super fresh. Tasty beverage. I was intrigued by their Lil' Doggies. Will have to try those next time..."}
{"text":"Came here for milkshakes and waited until after 8pm so they would be 1/2 price. I got a mini banana cream pie shake. It was yummy, however at the bottom there was a mysterious white piece of plastic. I wanted to bring it to the store's attention. The manager identified it as a part from their shake machine and he was very apologetic. He offered to get us new shakes or other food but my friend & I had already eaten so he refunded the money. I really just wanted them to know about it, but appreciated the refund."}
{"text":"I went to Sonic for a Jr. Cheeseburger, fries, chili cheese tots, and a cherry limeade, but the girl taking my order couldn't figure out how to ring up a regular Jr. Cheeseburger. \"The Jr. Deluxe Burger?\" \"No, the one with ketchup, mustard, and pickles.\" \"So you want the Jr. Double Cheeseburger.\" \"No, it's the one that comes in the kid's meal.\" She couldn't figure it out. \"I'm just going to ring up a Jr. Deluxe Burger with no lettuce, tomato, or onion.\" \"OK.\" My food comes out and the girl asks how I want to pay. I said I swiped my card. She said, \"I don't think any of these work, just the first one.\" OK... so I gave her cash. I unwrap my burger and it has mayo on it... I press the button. \"My Jr. Burger has mayo on it. I wanted ketchup & mustard.\" A girl comes out and asks what's wrong. I tell her it has mayo and I wanted ketchup & mustard. She goes back to have it fixed. New burger comes out. It has ketchup & mustard but the pickles are now missing. Close enough. I drive home. When I get home, I discover my chili cheese tots are actually chili cheese fries... OMG. Sonic, you suck."}
{"text":"Went to Sonic off of Arizona Ave in  Chandler Az. We ordered 2 hotdogs tots grilled chicken sandwich. They were very good at taking our order. We got our food at the parking space in less than 5 min. Hot dogs were good and chicken was ok..Food was a C+ .
Service... A... Sitting in car to eat was awkward . Had to get out of car to thru trash away.... next time we will do a drive thru.. we noticed most people do that.... 
Nice Sonic location"}
{"text":"this place is horrible! to say the least. why did we bother. maybe hoping it will get better, but it don't. your order is wrong. food is old..
better off going next door"}
{"text":"First time coming to this location. We went through drive thru but we usually go to the one on Charleston. They messed up my order but I didn't want to drive back. On the bright side we got extra tater tots!"}
{"text":"Wow.... where do I start? 
Well about a week ago I ordered a burger and a side, I received the wrong burger and the wrong side, but I had already rode my bike home. So I called the manager on duty, lets call him \"T\". He was SUPER kind and wrote me down for a comp the next time I came in which was tonight. 
I came all the way from phoenix but wanted to claim my free meal on the way home so I stopped in. It took them 15 MIN to bring out my comp order, but it was wrong again because they didn't read the order back to me to verify (and they never have). So I told the carhop and it took another ten minutes to get the correct burger out to me. By this time, my side item was cold. I had every intention of tipping the carhop even though I was claiming a free order. But she was so distant and lacked people skills and didn't remember the things I requested and didn't look me in the eyes, plus my order was wrong a third time. By the time I rode home, my food was cold (I even had it in a warm environment for the whole journey) and there was little to no condiments on my burger! Who wants a dry burger? Not this guy.
All I can say, is the night manager on duty every time I go there looks like a punk (hood always covering his face, and I sound old for saying that, but I'm a 25 year old punk rocker myself, haha) and the kitchen seems to be stoned because I witnessed 3 inaccurate orders while I was trying to claim mine. 
My main complaint is that I worked at Sonic for over 2 years, and this kind of behavior at my locations would've gotten me fired. I've returned to the restaurant business since then and my philosophy is STILL to treat the customer how you would like to be treated. What's so hard about that?! Yeah, it's fast food. Yeah, they get paid minimum wage. But if you cant even follow your recipes, common sense, and core values, you don't deserve to have the job. There's many people out of work who would kill to have a job, even at Sonic.
It's sad because this location is RIGHT by my house and it's good for a quick, cheap meal, but I will not be returning. This is absolutely the WORST Sonic experience I've ever had and it's the worst Sonic I've been to. What a shame, too, because it's in such a nice area. Maybe it's just the night crew since that's the time I usually visit, but all I know is this location needs a revamping of values and employees."}
{"text":"My final Las Vegas meal/snack comes from a fast food franchise I don't see significantly much in the Bay Area. 

I haven't been to Sonic in a few years (Tracy, Ca's location in 2007). Amazingly, this is my second time ever visit to the franchise. 

This location, which is located directly across the street from the Palm's Hotel and Casino, also has a kiosk machine to order our food and beverage. But this machine did take forever to get the worker's attention that I wanted to eat. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/On8O41uCKj1GfF1Bt4S2Lg?select=ATiSDylfA0woXPy8UNigkQ

I came at 2pm and happy hour had begun with the drinks are half price. 

I had the medium-size Cherry flavored Limeade, which regularly costs $1.49. Happy hour price is less than a $1.00. Despite Las Vegas being overcast and windy, the drink was very refreshing and thirst quenching. I'm a big fan of the drink and hit the jackpot here. 

I also had a craving for Cheesy Chili tater-tots for $2.99. I'm a big fan of the nasty dish!

My meal: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/On8O41uCKj1GfF1Bt4S2Lg?select=Wxkgdrit2dt6tECZ_wTBTA

The waiter was on roller-skates and brought my food out. So cool, to see that.  
               
I hope Sonic will continue to bring more restaurants to the Bay Area!"}
{"text":"The worst service..came out of my daughter's concert at waited 20 mins as 2 other cars came and left (1was a party of six) they left and we. Couldn't get a hot dog and popcorn chicken...25 mins total...last time there"}
{"text":"The only reason I even gave them three stars was not because of the food but for their drinks I always stop by here especially during summer drinks are always refreshing so many flavors&great happy hour deals FYI never order the onion rings yuck they taste as tho they fried them in the same batter the use for the honey corn dogs"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's not so great. Always fresh, always clean and fast. Just not always consistent. A cherry limeaid should taste the same. Always. Every day."}
{"text":"I always go for their chili cheese tots and mozzarella sticks. Food is always hot and fresh just the way I like it. And their service is GREAT! Definitely my go to spot for munchies."}
{"text":"If you eat here, pay by credit card through the drive thru and your credit card number gets stolen within a week, don't be surprised.  Call to document; 1-866-OK-SONIC"}
{"text":"Took the family to sonic and we pulled into the ordering stall.  I ordered four meals with milkshakes instead of soda.  For some odd reason,  the order taker refused to acknowledge that we ordered four milkshakes instead of soda.  I repeated the order seven times for her and each time she slowly repeated it incorrectly.  She also kept saying, \"Hold on.  Be right back.\"  Then she would come back and repeat the order incorrectly again.  She just wasn't getting it.  I lost my patience after 10 minutes.  I politely asked her to cancel the order and she did.  She asked slowly, \"Do you want someone else to take your order?\"  I said, \"No.  Thank you.\"  That girl had a fundamental issue with English or she was high.  Either way,  we're not going to even try to eat here anymore. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Ok..
I know how sonic runs... i was a manager at a sonic for 3 years in colorado... so explain to me when I tell them NO onions, ( cuz im allergic to them) they put ONIONS on it.... really... i didnt find out until i got home.... then what ever happend to  offer them up size on there order???"}
{"text":"Very slow service and workers do not seem very happy. However, I keep coming back for 50% off milkshakes after 8pm!"}
{"text":"Remember when Sonic used to be the place to go for very cheap but good burgers?  What a shock my visit today was!  I had a bacon double cheeseburger, which used some kind of reconstituted tasteless bacon and was virtually tasteless.  It cost $5.89, outrageous for a fast-food burger!  Our order also had a green chili burger at $4.59, frozen tater tots with a little chili/cheese sauce at $3.49 and an astronomically priced \"blast\" which was an incredible $5.29 (we only ordered one drink).  Our total for two hamburgers, a small handful of tater tots and the blast drink was ... are you sitting down ... $20.92!!!  Plus since they have carhops you feel obligated to tip on top of that.

I'm sure you, like me, can think of about 20 places to go to get a far better burger for a lot less money. I suspect a lot of their new billionaire pricing is to pay for their fancy new drive-up terminals.

Service?  This is one of the few food places I can't comment on service because you don't actually get any ... someone assists taking your order which you complete yourself on the touchscreen and someone walks across the parking lot and hands you the bag.  There is zero service at this place.

And as far as the \"convenience\" of being able to just drive up and order?  Has the owner of Sonic actually tried to do that, I mean in a real car?  You drive up and the car window is at the height of the bottom of the menu board, 90% of which towers above you and you are parked so close there is NO way you can read it.  Somebody who clearly should not have a job at Sonic decided to place a giant video screen running promo photos (that change every 2.5 seconds) right in front of your face but the stuff you want/need to see is completely out of your view, AND forget about anyone else in the car being able to see the menu, it's impossible. As a passenger I literally had to get out of the car and walk around to the driver's side to get any view at all of the menu. That's convenient?

I suspect Sonic will soon be added to the list of all of those once-popular business names that have gone out of business.  Oh yeah, we were there about 6:30 PM on a Friday night ... I remember when their parking lot used to be jammed full of cars on a Friday. These days it was almost empty.  Gee, I wonder why?  Are you reading this Danielle?"}
{"text":"FINALLY!! i finally got to go to a SONICS after watchin a million of their commercials  we stopped by right after we left the rio(becuz its RIGHT NEXT TO IT) 

we pulled in and i stared at the huge screen until i was ready to order. then u push this button and u order! we got there at like 3:30pm so it was happy hour! (2-4pm every day!) so we got LARGE realfruit slushies for only like 80cents! sweeet~!!  hannah got the lemon berry and i got a strawberry plus we got tatertots & onion rings to keep ourselves awake on the drive home!! u then can pay with ur card rite there and then a dude on rollerblades rolls out to give u the food hehee i felt like i was in the flinstones!

the drinks were sooooo good and for less then a BUCK how can u got wrong? i wish there were more sonics around me...the onion rings and tots? not so good. they were OKAY nothing amazing but forsure ima hafta stop by here everytime in lv before i go home the large slush stayed yum & frozen till i was nearly back to the OC!"}
{"text":"ordered a #11 with route 44 Dr. pepper....a #11 comes with 3 or 5 piece chicken tenders, tater tots 1 onion ring and Texas toast in a box.

after 10 min they brought me a route 44 and 5 piece tenders... I said I ordered a #11 they said no you have to order a combo? what is a #11 then..

so 8 minutes later they bring me 5 piece chicken tenders tater tots and my drink... in a bag small size.. come on sonic I love you guys... but this is so sad"}
{"text":"if you want extremely slow service and rude cashiers then this place is for you.... i know its high school kids working there but manners is obviously not a high priority there and neither is taking the order right. i asked for a bbq sauce and instead get a handful of ranch..... and i asked tots and get fries! anyways not going back as i like getting my orders correct on first try thanks anyways"}
{"text":"I live down the street, so I've been here fairly often. They can never seem to get our order right! My roommate always orders an Oreo Peanut Butter Blast. He has gotten an Oreo milkshake, a Peanut Butter milkshake, and a Peanut Butter milkshake with hot fudge in the past trying to order this shake. Tonight, his shake was right, but I ordered a frozen cherry limeade, says it right on the receipt. What did I get? Frozen lemonade. Seriously? This location needs to step up their game in getting orders correct."}
{"text":"Worst Sonic I've ever been to. I was in line for 15 mins and the girl even came out and served the person behind me. I ordered one thing and still had to wait an extra 5 mins once I got to the window."}
{"text":"This location is absolutely horrible. You will wait in line at least 10-15 minutes before you'll either give up and leave, or finally get some service. The food isn't good. There are always creepy people around. I just wanted a shake! The owner needs to do something about this place."}
{"text":"Generally, I love Sonic. It is by far my favorite fast food restaurant. This one however, is the worst location I have ever eaten at. The food is extremely inconsistent. Blasts are often not mixed through, so you end up getting plain Vanilla towards the bottom. Order extra items like extra brownie? You MAY get it ... Or you may simply be charged for it but the amount they give you here is so minimal it just isn't worth it. I don't feel like paying for a single tiny brownie thrown in there. Like shakes? Flip a coin ... Because sometimes you will get a shake you can sip with a straw, and other times you get another Blast flavor. When you order cinnasnacks with cream cheese frosting, you shouldn't have to ask for cream cheese frosting separately. I've seriously ordered a few times and didn't get it because I forgot to ask for it. 

These are issues I don't have with other locations. I ... just ... don't. Yet, this location is a short walk from my place, so I go for convenience. But I'm not going to expect quality."}
{"text":"Wow - I understand that this is a fast food joint, but the customer service of your employees is absolutely awful. The person taking our order was completely rude and acting as if our business was inconveniencing her. - Teach these kids some customer service skills please"}
{"text":"I like this place. So many choices on the Slush and Milkshakes menu. Have never had the same thing twice. 
The servers are always friendly and work very hard for you!!
Wish there was a way to tip the servers without needing cash.
Happy Hour Drink prices are the Best!!"}
{"text":"Dirty restaurant smells like a bathroom can't even tell if it was open or closed because the lights look off from outside but ok food"}
{"text":"Normally have no complaints about this location but today was an almost total fail. Cashier wasnt friendly. I was hoping to get a bag of ice and for some reason they arent able to sell ice right now. So I ordered a cherry blue raspberry nerds slushie and so the problems begin...first no nerds so thanks for having me pay for a product i didnt get. 2nd it didnt taste like I was expecting...yes it was purple which red and blue make purple so I had my partner taste it without telling him what flavor it was supposed to be and he said grape. Cherry and Blue Raspberry dont taste anything like grape s I also paid for the extra flavor that I obviously didnt get. The cashier was just plain not friendly. Seemed like we were bothering her. She handed us our drinks and said here ya go. I said thank you and she just kinda looked at me, so I said have a good day and then she responded while have a good one. The only bright spot was the peanut butter fudge master shake my partner got. Said it was delicious! I normally go through at least once a week for happy hour and never had any issues so thats what makes todays visit such a shock."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for happy hour drinks. No I'm not talking about beer or mix drinks! I'm talking about there unlimited choices on slushes and drinks! There are so many options to get really creative! I'm not really adventurous as most people adding a dozen ingredients in one cup. How ever, my favorite concoction is a strawberry and lemon slush! Mmmmmm so refreshing and especially on a hot summer In Phoenix! Bomb!

Let's also high light the coconut water which is always will be one of my favorites! I high recommend it. Also, had there tasty tots that are always on point. Definitely my go to spot."}
{"text":"\"Fast\" food. Honestly it would be quicker to go milk a cow and make your own ice cream instead of sitting in the drive-thru line at this location. We came on a Thursday night at 1:30 AM and it took until 2:20 AM to get the milkshake. Honestly it's a once in a blue moon occurrence when I go to Sonic's but this experience makes me never want to come back. Upon reaching the front of the line, the shakes were melting from sitting out for such a long period of time. As someone who works in customer service, I completely understand when something goes wrong in the work environment; however, the two girls at the register were rude and unapologetic. Other customers were exiting the line and complaining about the drawn out wait for their food, meanwhile, the girl was on her cellphone. I would highly suggest providing better training to the young employees who work here, especially since it's a good place to indulge in once in a while but even then, there are better options that are opened 24/7."}
{"text":"Just aweful service. This location has NEVER had even 1 employee that looks like they are over the age of 16 and the service matches that. No one seems to be in charge and the drive thru lane takes at least 15 min. every time. Please for God's sake, hire a capable manager for this place!"}
{"text":"Very rude server, order was $25.67 yesterday, card machine wasn't working gave him $100 bill, as I took drinks off tray, he told me to replace them till his manager gave approval for the $100. Took our food and drinks and our money inside stayed about 5 mins, came back with attitude and I still had to unload the tray of slightly warm food. Never again, you are a business keep freakin change or go to bank which is .1 mile away and train your servers in customer service before they meet someone else like me."}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with Sonic. Love a Cherry Limeade during Happyhour when its hot as Hell outside. Friendly employees and service with a smile. Keeping this review short and sweet."}
{"text":"Love Sonic. I was thirsty and got a Route 44. And a Chicago Dog. Im not disappointed with much if anything on the menu but the hot dog fell short. It wasnt anything to write home about and ill never try it again."}
{"text":"This will be 2 REVIEWS in 1. I went to Sonic the other night. And Im bad at looking at my order before driving off. Well when i got back to the Hotel i noticed they gave me fries and not onion rings. So after a lengthy drive back i pull up and explain my problem. He says i know the orders were off and i TOTALLY got the WRONG ORDER. He proceeded to let me keep it, and gave me my correct order. I scored. Then he gave me a free SUNDAE and 3 FREE DRINK TOKENS. NOW THATS CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

The 2nd time i went No complaints, the Order was correct and delicious and i did check it this time before i left the Drive thru. Way to go Sonic. Mcdonalds doesnt offer that kind of cust service with a screwed up order."}
{"text":"This Sonic is one of the better ones that ive been to. The food quality doesnt suffer even if the drive thru line is long and they are knocking out the cars. I prefer the Onion RIngs over the fries. Though there fries are still good. But the Onion rings are a little crispy but still soft and come out piping hot and greasy. Not all dry and burnt like some onion rings at a other establishment who will remain nameless. There is a Mcdonalds on the other corner but come on its a No Brainer where to go, when you want Scrumptous sandwiches. Delicious Desserts. Onion rings that will make you googley eyed. Drinks deserving of a king. And they are open late and i love the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"I am a fan, as far as the fast food industry goes. I am not usually a big fast food eater. But i was with a mom and 3 kids at the time. Tater tots, yummmm!! I am huge burger girl and will say they were pretty good. I like the convince of this place. 
Pull up, order, swipe ur card and the bring the food to your car! 
Watching and hoping they dont fall in their roller skates with the food! haha, I was so hungry! 
I think I will be back next time in AZ :)"}
{"text":"I love Sonics but this location was very disappointing. I ordered a Cherry Limeade which was watered down and flavorless, tater tots which were old and stale, and a value burger which was messy and awful. I ordered these items at other locations and they are great but this particular location just isn't good compared to others."}
{"text":"Best place to go for your happy hour drinks! Nerds Slushes are awesome, Employees are always have great attitudes, makes me want to always go back."}
{"text":"The kid's meal chicken strips are better than most, for sure!! At least the meat can be identified as REAL chicken breast! They don't provide much as far as portion size goes. The kid gets two chicken strips. My kid can eat ten! 

It was a weird experience last time. The gal came out to take the order. She clearly saw we have a boy. Our boy got a girl toy. I know the schools are brainwashing our kids to believe that pink is for boys, and apparently this young gal has been part of this system. When I asked for a BOY toy in exchange for the pink obvious GIRL toy, she looked completely confused and maybe even annoyed at such a request. Shaking my head in disbelief."}
{"text":"First time ever to sonic...inspired. by silly commercials. Had onion rings....good not too greezy  and sour blue raspberry slushy....yummy. overall. \"B+\""}
{"text":"I'm giving the KIDS MEALS 4 stars. So much BETTER than McDonald's!! Their chicken nuggets are better than McDonald's. They also offer a grilled cheese, which is pretty tasty, burgers, hot dogs and corn dogs as choices for their kid's meals.

Serving fresh, hot food is a challenge for this location!! I usually go through the drive thru, do a temperature check and park my ass at one of the spots with a menu and a speaker and request the food be replaced with fresh, hot food. 

You have your choice of apple slices, tator tots or french fries and your choice of so MANY drink options, including lots of frozen frosty flavors!! I usually stick with chocolate milk for our guy but a frosty is a nice treat sometimes!

The toys are cool and the price is right!! From $2.99 to $3.39."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE - Long wait for fast junk food - girl drops cup on floor and puts it back to give someone"}
{"text":"Can't beat happy hour milkshakes. Their service is always fast and they sincerely apologize when they have a little bit of a wait. Love coming here for a late night sugar crave :)"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. I never want to come back to this sonic. They take forever and do an extremely poor job. Don't even think about driving up it will take 20 minutes to get your order. 

The drive thru seemed to move a little faster but still not fast food. 

The people taking your order don't repeat what they have down and mess up after charging you. They are inconsiderate and lazy."}
{"text":"Sonic is always good to us, but sometimes they give us POWERade that taste like water. Gross."}
{"text":"Just sat 20 mins in the drive through for them to not even take the order. The person in front of us ordered a drink and tater tots and it took 10 mins for her to get her food. Left to eat somewhere else. Don't bother going to this one."}
{"text":"Food was okay...it's fast food....but not really \"fast\"I tried to place order and was being rushed by order taker. After ordering one thing she cut me off and said it would be right out. Walked to the window to order the rest of my order. The lady told me I had to go to my car and pay for the other order..."}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars or minus I would. So we decided to hit sonic tonight anyone that has been up late and wants something fast will hit a fast food joint.

The wait until the window to pay was 15 minutes, the entire time watched a kid dance that worked there, finally get to the window the manager I assume was extremely rude opened the window while telling the worker off, have her the amount of our order, she then open the window now telling the worker to get off his damn phone or she's going to take it away. Completely no personality this girl couldn't even last at a call in center no idea how she's in charge of any business. After all this it took about another 10 minutes or so to get our food, she just opens the window puts our food out and doesn't say anything 

Probably the worst drive they experience I've had. Come on we know your jobs not the best but at-least have decency towards the people that help pay your check."}
{"text":"Want a quick dessert delivered to your window by friendly staff? This location has that. The attendant taking my order spoke in a polite and professional manner. The girl who delivered my pineapple sundae with nuts ($1.99) and my friends regular Snickers ice cream ($2.49) was bubbly. The treats came out within 5 minutes and we got to enjoy our dessert on a warm Vegas winter day.

The epitome of a nice day. Come during 2pm-5pm and enjoy 1/2 off drinks during Happy Hour. Yet their menu is affordable to begin with. I usually love an ice cream float because they use soft serve. The chocolate malt shakes are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to their vanilla soft serve ice cream! We call it marshmallow ice cream, it has a different taste than other soft serves, which makes it something particular that I crave.
 I'll occasionally get a shake or a slushie drink, that's pretty much it. I use the drive thru, which is convenient, staff is friendly."}
{"text":"We come here a lot as its close to our residence and it's always great here. The service here has been through some changes, we can see new people are coming and going but the Sonic experience is alive and well here.   I'll recommend this Sonic to the rest of world here or that live around here or coming or going from the lakes."}
{"text":"How long does it take to deliver 3 drinks?  And then you can't get the order right.  Wow!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Sonic location a number of times over the past year and a half.  Normally, the service is okay.  A little slow, but most Sonic's are so I get it.

Plus two stars because, hello... cheeseburgers. 

My main complaints:

Incorrect Orders: This I can overlook.  They don't always screw up my order, but when they do I'm too lazy to turn around and go back.  Obviously I'm lazy - I'm eating at Sonic!  However, this is a fast food chain and when are places like this not screwing something up?  Minus zero stars because screwing up orders is like part of their identity or something. 

Bug in My Food: Last year I found a huge (to me, I'm a baby when it comes to bugs) flying ant in my tator tots.  Yuck.  Minus one star because bugs are gross but I'm still a reasonable person.  It's not like it went in my mouth or anything. 

Nail Clipping in My Slush: Who doesn't love a Lemon Berry Slush?  Me. Now.  Ever since this weekend when I sucked up a nail clipping that is.  Yes, a nail clipping.  In my mouth.  Minus two stars because it touched my insides.  And it was yellow-ish and unkempt. 

No more, Sonic.  No more.  Keep your bugs and bits of body parts to yourself.

Note: As of this writing, this location is closed and roped off.  What did other people find this weekend?"}
{"text":"This is a hit and miss operation.......  Same for the food on taste and service......   There is a lot of burger joints, I would pass on this place for burgers and dogs.  Pater tots are good and they have soft ice cream cones, all one size and the workers suck on making the cones.  Yea you need to be a Genius to swirl soft serve ice cream into a cone....  Because the ten people that they have tried are all morons.....  Some of the cones we have gotten, look like Helen Keller made them....  No Lie!

Hit and Miss!"}
{"text":"so it's 9pm and you had dinner a couple hours earlier and you just feel like something sweet, so you hop into the car and head over to the Sonic Drive - in and grab a quick ice cream cone, or a Banana Milk Shack.  Not a better way to end your evening!"}
{"text":"I come here often, usually I wait extra time just from slow service, but if I'm in no rush i don't mind. Today I went and it was just a horrible experience. A server by the name of Amanda had the absolute WORST attitude and didn't want to fix our order after she messed it up. Just horrible, def my last time going back. Would recommend the drive to other Sonic locations just to avoid the terrible service!"}
{"text":"Literally get my order wrong every single time! Simple Jr. HAMBURGER, no tomato, add ketchup. What do I get everytime? Jr. CHEESEBURGER with tomato and no ketchup. They just give you the ones that are already premade with the sticker on it. Not fresh at all most of the time. Seems like just lazy workers. Gave them more than enough chances. Will not be returning. Save yourself from disappointment and drive to any other Sonic!"}
{"text":"Bought a large fry  & they were cooked in old oil, cold and chewy. What a waste of money!"}
{"text":"My kids love the chili cheese dogs here and I like the cheesy tater tots. Seriously where else can you buy fast food tater tots covered in cheese? The afternoon happy hour for slushes is also nice on the wallet."}
{"text":"Love their cherry limeade and ocean water drinks. Typically get the cheeseburger and chilli cheese fries. Their shakes are good if your in the mood for something sweet. Went through the drive thru this time and the guy didn't repeat our order back to us so he charged us an extra burger.... Of course they returned it but ended up having to re ring everything and the refund doesn't go thru for 24 hours. The lady then told us if the return didn't go through to come back and try again which was a bit unsettling. What can I say it's a fast food restaurant lol."}
{"text":"Best tots ever!!!!! I'll have to try the onion rings next time! I would not get hamburger or fries. I recommend hot dog, tots and ice tea! :)"}
{"text":"Anything you want fried, you can get it here. Anticipate a gurgling stomach after consuming and tell yourself you'll never come here again....but I promise you will. 

Sonic is a really weird place because it is REVERED by the late-teen to mid-20s male crowd but I think it is mainly due to the fact that they have any junk you could possibly want at pretty late hours. I mainly come here for their ice cream which is hit or miss. One time, I came here twice in a month and the ice cream had a grit to it which was disgusting because it tasted like paste. Just to torture myself because I guess I like pain or suffering, I came back the next month and the ice cream was on point. So the moral of the story is, come here hungry and let Sonic surprise you with what they cook up."}
{"text":"I was hoping that this experience would be better than our Sonic in N Central Washington. Alas, no. The order was simple - chicken strips with ranch and a supersonic double with ketchup, mustard and pickle. No ranch, no sauce on the burger. They provided ranch dressing when I walked up and asked. The kids love this place but I am definitely not a fan. Disappointing"}
{"text":"OUT of ONION RINGS at NOON?? Seriously?  How does a fast food restaurant known for certain items on the menu NOT HAVE THEM available?  What has happened to service these days?"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Came quickly.  The machine where you pay was slow and buggy which was kind of annoying. Other then that, it was a good experience"}
{"text":"Ugh. Come on sonic. I tried to be nice. Pull up around 8pm on a Thursday. Place is moderately busy. Order a mini m&m sonic blast. Guy rings it up as a medium. Don't feel like hitting the button again to clarify so I say sure, I'll take the medium. 

Ice cream comes out quick..... and has a nice bundle of m&ms on top of the whipped cream. However, when I get to the actual ice cream.... nothing. I dig around a little, pretending I'm in the opening of the next Jurassic Park movie, trying to find that precious fossil. Nada. 

Come on man!!! Blasts are supposed to be BLASTED with candy. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"Pretty fast service, and this is the only sonic I've ever found that has an indoor lobby you can eat in. The staff is friendly and my orders are always delivered correctly, a big ++ for me !!"}
{"text":"I came to sonic to get some bbq boneless wings and i ended up getting ice cream to because i couldn't resist. This really has to be one of my all time favorite stop and go places to eat"}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and pretty good. The problem is that they always screw up my order. No sauce for my chicken strips, the wrong type of hot dog, wrong type of shake... I can go on and on. Yeah, I could check my order before I leave, but I shouldn't have to."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for years and the service has always been friendly and nice. I think their jolly rancher flavors are way too sweet for my own tastebuds but my family loves it. I like their corn dogs and tater tots the most. We like sitting in the car and eating and this is the perfect place for it. They're very quick too even on roller skates"}
{"text":"If you've ever looked at my lists, then you know, I have one of just Sonic Burgers.  Why? cause I live in Northern CA, and we get the comercials, but not actually the restaurants - and I'm a long time lover of the Coney, The texas grilled cheese, and of course - the end all be off of refreshment..

The strawberry limeade.

This was a daily stop for me on my last several trips to Vegas.  I pretty much only came over for the Strawberry Limeades, mostly cause I was hung over 90% of the time, and didn't actually eat until later.

Still, they make a good Strawberry Limeade, and I'll be seeing ya'll next week!"}
{"text":"Food was decent... Customer service was not that great. While ordering I asked a question and had to repeat myself three times bcs I'm assuming she couldn't hear me. By the third time she said \"mam ask your question\". I could tell she was getting frustrated and by the way she was coming across started to get me frustrated...While I repeated it once more she would cut me off as if I wasn't asking fast enough. I continued to order a chicken sandwich and tots. During this whole process it was as if I was  inconveniencing her and not ordering fast enough. I know it's just fast food but I won't be returning for rude service when I know i can pay less for fresher quality and better friendly service. My order takers name was Katie. And my server was James. He was a really nice guy and super helpful ! I wish he had taken my simple order instead of Katie."}
{"text":"I wanted to get half price drinks after 8pm. I saw you have Cinnasnacks so I placed a order of 5. The Service of the Man doing the drive thru register was Awesome very polite and friendly.he Failed to give me a reciept though but after complaing about the snacks,I believe his name is Ryan that is whats on the reciept. he did give me a reciept after asking for it. Anyways, I grabbed a Cinnasnack out of the bag,and noticed it was doughey, I guess it being after 11:05pm only the drive thru was open. but the gal came out to help and took the order back. She came out with 5 more.and not tell I got home I noticed they were still Doughey. You need to please have them check the way they are cooking them,or maybe just get Rid of them!!! Its not worth $4.09 to have doughey food!!!
There 1/2 price drinks after 8pm are very good"}
{"text":"We had the grouchiest order taker on this Sunday evening! We had a simple order of 2 coney meals - chili on the side. What we got was a little tiny container of cold cheese and chili (NOT EVEN ENOUGH for the 2 orders)!!!!  We were gipped! I mean how hard was it to do this?!? I didn't want a soggy hot dog soaked in chili.....we are never going back here as their food is always a disappointment anyway but the service just topped it off by validating how awful it is. I mean lady if you hate your job.....quit! I wish more management would pay attention to yelp and do something about the horrible customer service people they hire."}
{"text":"Worst sonic ever! Waited a half hour in drive through. Just for the the girl to mess up the order."}
{"text":"Butterfinger Blast! MMMMMM!!!"}
{"text":"Holy Moly. Sonics drinks and ice will bring a dead person back from the grave. You can get any concoction you can possibly think of and the ice is perfect for crunching. Their tots with cheese are ridiculously good too. The rest of their food can kind of be blah but I love every version of their tots you can get. They had a sparkling strawberry lemonade that isnt on the menu anymore but I would hit my mama for it! It was amazing!"}
{"text":"Usually it's slow especially later in the day. Today I couldn't believe how quick my food came and tasted good! Redemption!"}
{"text":"We are checking in a Sonic during happy hour! 
Love the drink and shake specials just; remember happy hour for drinks is 2:00pm to 5:00pm. 
Happy hour for shakes is 8:00pm!

They accept all forms of payment (not apple quick pay) and you can order and pay right on the screen and the track the status of your food right up to the Car Hop bringing it to your car!"}
{"text":"Went for a pretzel dog and I was highly disappointed, bun was stale & the bacon wasn't even cut up. I used to love sonic I'll probably never go back...."}
{"text":"So dissatisfied....I went here to grab a quick bite and sat at in the drive thru at the order box waiting for about five minutes. No one said be right with you or acknowledged I was there. When I got to order my order wasn't displayed on the screen or repeated back to me. I got the boneless wings. When they were handed to me it didn't feel warm. When I got home they were for sure at best room temperature and they were pretty stale, with barely any sauce on them! 

At the bottom of my receipt it says change: $0.77 
I didn't get any change back. Why would it say that when I payed with my card? 
So disappointed."}
{"text":"I worked here for a short period of time. If you'd like to know how awful the place truly is, and how they don't really care about your service, please PM me."}
{"text":"I go to this drive thru 6 days per week. I don't eat the food, but I LOVE the iced tea. It is perfectly brewed with crushed ice. I can't stop my car from pulling in. The only complaint is the order takers are terrible. And slow. But yet I go there everyday anyway."}
{"text":"This may be the worst sonic on earth! Very disappointed its the only one around! Staff is always rude and order has never been right first time. I will never leave the drive through again untill I have checked the bag!"}
{"text":"I wanted to put Sonic on the fast food plateau that I find In N Out to be. Certainly Burger Puke and McVomit know where they are on the chain of chains. And I love the car hop style allowing you to peruse the menu and hit the red button when you're ready while enjoying some Depeche Mode or Pet Shop Boys. The chili dog is sad. No snap. Just a sad soggy ass dog in a sad soggy ass bun. The burgers are OK. One up from the King and Ronald but well below In N Out. Tater tots. That's what I like here. Mmmm... But the onion rings. NO. It's like they added vanilla to the batter and they end up tasting like Febreze Rings. Gross. But the beverages are top notch. Strawberry Limeade always hits the spot. I don't crave 'em like I do my In N Out burgers, but when I wanna feel like Ralph Malph or Potsie at the car hop with Richie and The Fonz, I pull my wheels in to Sonic."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill since my last review. The service is even slower than before and the food quality is poor at best. Also, most of the card readers at the stalls don't work. Such a shame as this place was right down the street for me."}
{"text":"The one on Bridgeville has horrible service. Sat there for 15 min today waiting for someone to answer the bell. It kept telling me my order was on the way even though I never got to order."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've ordered from this sonic and was not happy with my order. Both times I ordered the same thing, that turtle blast thing. First time I ordered it I was upset but thinking \" okay maybe they're having an off day\". But this time I ordered and the same thing and it was literally just vanilla ice cream with pecans sprinkled on top. THATS IT! I just sprang $20 on ice cream for the fam. Shame on me."}
{"text":"They should have actual adults working here !! I waited 20 minutes for my food . Not only did I wait 20 minutes they didn't even put that much food in the container . I ordered a large chili cheese fry and I opened it to 6 fries . The milk shake they gave me was over filled and the lid wasn't even on all the way and spilled all over my new car and not once did they apologize . Nothing but hoodrats working here . They were all just standing around ."}
{"text":"Service is terrible! They started to take our order at the stall, didn't finish, or respond. So we left!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and wasn't impressed.  I had the double sonic burger with bacon.  The fries were just mediocre and the burger really wasn't anything impressive either.  The only thing that gave this review a second star was the Cherry Limeade.  Honestly a great drink too bad the food couldn't be on par."}
{"text":"Rolling out of bed at 1 pm, hunger pangs... quick shower, quick drive to the north end of the strip. I saw a commercial upon rousing that day, and had a plan, nay, a GOAL-- Sonic.

A chicken toaster, fried mac and cheese, extra long chili cheese coney, tator tots, sausage bistro sandwich, sonic sunrise, cranberry limeade, and $15 later, I was satisfied. Now ready for another night in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time and am usually very pleased with the service, food and drinks. Love Sonic Ice!! But what is the deal with the sewage smell? I couldn't even finish placing my order today because of the smell. It's not all the time...thankfully...but often enough to require some attention. Come on Sonic...you can fix this!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly especially Jose who fixed my order extremely fast. Would have tipped him the big bucks if I had cash on me."}
{"text":"9/28 10:50pm CLOSED, due to cleaning the parking lot? Really doors are locked and a guy says were cleaning the parking lot? Ok, so that's a reason to closed business? Never heard of such a thing? I understand parking lots need to be cleaned, well who ever is in charge needs to know, Vegas is a 24 hour town and there is companies that clean parking lots after business hours. -Never Again, this location!!"}
{"text":"I live near this location and very much enjoy when half price shakes come around for the summer so my friend and I visit later at night. Well, last night we went and arrived at about 11:50, which is closer to close but there was people in the drive thru as well as the spaces. We did not have a complicated order, just some shakes and sides. We sat in the drive thru line after we ordered for roughly twenty minutes before someone finally came out and took our payment. Once the payment was taken it took another five minutes to run the card which should have taken less than a minute to do. We were so annoyed that we just left quickly but after pulling out we realized the tater tots and French fries were cold. The service was terrible and we were never apologized to for our wait."}
{"text":"Can't beat the half price milkshakes and slushies after 8 pm during the summer months. Great hours, staff and service. I haven't had a complaint yet!"}
{"text":"Ehhh.. we've experienced better Sonics. If you're in Charlotte and don't mind a drive, visit the one near Mt. Holly. Service was exceptionally slow and poor. Messed up my bill over 3 times and still got one of the items wrong. Mind you, it was only 2 milkshakes (coconut cream pie master shake, oreo chocolate master shake- they did vanilla instead of chocolate) and 1 slushie. One of the doors to the inside was supposed to be open, I guess in anticipation of closing (arrived shortly after 11pm, they close at 12 am) they locked them. The blonde opened it so I could use the restroom. Inside was dark, dirty, trash overflowing and a pool of liquid on the floor in the indoor dining room. Smelled funky. Inside the restroom, toilet paper and soap was stocked. Sink worked as well as one stall, handicapped stall was out of service. 
Moral of the story, go to the Mt. Holly location."}
{"text":"They don't answer the drive-thru speaker for 5 or so minutes. Watched cars behind me try to order and leave. If I were the franchise owner I'd be pissed."}
{"text":"this place is awful. unfortunately its the only convenient place around my apartment other than mcdonalds (yuck) i have gotten hair in my food TWICE! and they take 10 minutes just to bring a drink out to you. would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Pretty much go for the route 44 drinks. My favorite is the ocean water with extra coconut."}
{"text":"They seemed a bit thinly staffed, but as with most Sonics which are situated in the middle of nowhere, it's not that surprising.  Our carhop was Alyssa and was very friendly."}
{"text":"I love their shakes and the summer time special for 1/2 off after 8 PM.  

Having said that the service is slow and quite often they get the orders incorrect.  Don't over complicate your order with too many customizations, because they will just ignore your requests.  By the time you get home you can't be bothered to do anything but eat whatever they shove in the greasy bag.

The food is delicious, but overpriced for fast food.  To their credit they do have a value menu with yummy bites like a grill cheese for $1.49.  A corn dog for .99 cents or a chicken strip sandwich for under $2.00.  Also on Sunday they have a $5.00 chicken meal.  Other than that, be prepared to spend $7.00 and up per person. 

Also, if you pull into the slot and order from the car, it's encouraged to Tip the service folks."}
{"text":"The food is good but expensive, for fast food, and on top of that...  The wait time is completely unacceptable!  

We waited for 20 minutes in the drive through, then another 15 minutes for our single, simple order.

This is the Sonic across the street from Concord Mills.  There were rowdy teenagers having fun, but annoying all of the other patrons.

The food, at least was hot, fresh and delicious (so my husband said).  After waiting for 35 minutes for a chicken sandwich, coke and fries...  The lady apologized profusely for our wait, but didn't offer to make good with bonus coupons or anything!  

This particular Sonic doesn't care about repeat customers.  There is a Zaxby's right next door on one side, and a Cookout on the other side.  A person would be foolish to spend their money and considerable time at this place."}
{"text":"Attempted to order a diet green tea but noticed that the screen listed my order as a \"green tea-sweetened\". I inquired with the staff and that's when I was informed that they were out of the diet green tea. It should NOT be up to the employee to substitute items without notifying the customer. Especially when it comes to diet and none diet items. I was simply trying to save on calories but people with health conditions (i.e. diabetes) depend on accurate information and orders to help maintain their health!"}
{"text":"Every time I go here they mess up my order. I ordered a squirtle this time and they gave me a jigglypuff and we took it back and the manager came out and said \"you ordered a Jigglypuff, I was standing right next to him when you ordered\" and I said \" no, I made sure i said Squirtle because last time I ordered it you gave me a turtle milkshake\" and they were so rude about it. It took two people to come outside before they gave us the drink we wanted. One time, we were there for an hour before we got our drinks delivered. (My friend and I like to go there to hang out when we have time). I don't care if they are riding on roller blades, this service is incredibly slow and the staff is horribly rude!

And my drink smells like a fart, good job guys"}
{"text":"Sonics is usually an ok option. Not my favorite, but I had never tried it for breakfast. Try something else, especially if you aren't excited about waiting. Service took forever."}
{"text":"So, I had never been the biggest fan of Sonic, but that may be changing!  

They just opened this Sonic right near my house (Could walk there if need be), and it was a welcome change from the typical Burger King/McDonalds/Jack in the Box type places.  I have always enjoyed Sonics drinks (shakes, limeades, etc) selection, but had only had their food a handful of times.  Not really sure why, I just never really craved Sonic I guess?  Anyways..........I saw a commercial on TV for \"The Carhop Classic\".  This combo comes with a 1/4 pound cheeseburger (or foot long hot dog) and a medium onion rings.  Cost?  $2.99!  What?  Unheard of to get a burger and side for less than $3.00.  I knew I had to try it out!

I got a new schedule at work now, so I am working until 8pm, and get home around 8:45 or so.  I decided to drop in the drive thru for a late dinner on Wednesday night.  I went with the Foot Long Coney Dog (Chili cheese dog) and onion rings for my side.  About that.......they advertise the onion rings as the side, but they gave me the option to choose onion rings, tater tots OR fries. They also gave me the option to somewhat customize my hot dog, too!  Score!  I went with the standard offering of the Coney Dog and onion rings.  Total was $3.24.  Here is how it was...........

Coney Dog-  This hot dog is giant!  Might even be more than a foot long!  They load it up with a ton of chili and some melted nacho style cheese.  First thing is first....you cannot expect to eat this in your car while sitting down.  This thing is messy as a mofo!  They do provide you with a fork, and I would almost recommend that option.  I'm no pussy though, so I picked the thing up like a man (and ruined my shirt in the process), and went to town.  Good dog, decent chili, good nacho cheese, good bun.  This thing was massive!  I can usually eat 3-4 hot dogs in one sitting, but this foot long was so big and filling, I couldn't have eaten any more.  While not the best hot dog I've ever had, it was very filling and dirt cheap!  

Onion Rings-  Wow!  I was impressed!  Sonic deep fries their rings to order, and you can tell.  They were piping hot, a little greasy, and smelled delicious!  I took a bite in and was overcome with a unique flavor (never experienced it on an onion ring) of what tasted like a funnel cake.  The batter had a sweet (not super sugary sweet, but definitely more than just flour and breadcrumbs) undertone to it.  It's almost too hard to describe even.  If you have had their onion rings before, you will know EXACTLY what I am talking about.  If you have not had them, I would highly recommend you get off your ass and get some!  These are probably the best fast food onion rings I have ever had!  That unique taste, paired with crunchy piping hot coating, made these a winner.  You get about 6-7 in an order, too.  Very filling and a great order of onion rings!

I was so impressed with the food to value ratio, I came back today for lunch.  This time I went with the Cheeseburger option with the onion rings. (I also had a survey on the bottom of my receipt from last night for a free 44oz drink.  Score!)  Here is how that was.......

1/4 Lb Burger-  This thing was very tasty!  Reminded me of a better Jumbo Jack.  Decent meat, good bun, fresh produce, good cheese.  Not sure I would pay $4 or $5.00 for just this burger alone, but in the $2.99 combo deal, it's an absolute steal and by far the best fast food value currently on the market.  I hope they keep it around for awhile longer!  Anyways.....had the onion rings again, and they were just as fantastic as last night.  

I am happy that this was built here.  I'm 100% sure I'll be back again for the $2.99 deal (as long as they have it), and will definitely hit this Sonic up for my milkshake/ice cream/drink fix.  It's conveniently located, brand new, and a good addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Love coming here during happy hour 2p-5p or during half price milkshakes after 8p. The drive thru lines are a bit longer and there are times when our wait was averaging 15mins. The last couple of times though, we parked and ordered because we were getting more than drinks and wanted to eat in the car. The wait wasn't that long at all, since it wasn't a busy time.

I like how the order window shows exactly what you order and you can pay right there with your credit card, or you can pay your food server when they skate on out. 

We have ordered the cheeseburgers here and I guess  because we were in the mood for them, they were delicious! Hot and juicy and filled with  lettuce, onion, tomatoes, pickles and condiments. Its a pretty big one, and I always share. we have never been disappointed . Have to get the tater tots with them, and jalapeno poppers. What a deal they have going on with the meals for 2 for $9.99. you can choose between cheeseburgers, coney hot dog, or chicken sandwich. fries or tater tots and 2 medium drinks. 

Workers are always pleasant and our order has always been correct. The only thing I wish for is that the cream slushes are included in the half price drink happy hour."}
{"text":"My husband went there on the way home from work to get milkshakes. The super sweet cashier applied some kind of discount/promotion/coupon to our order without us even asking; we were completely unaware of the promotion. Very sweet of her!"}
{"text":"Drive-through representative has the worst attitude.  I thought I'd drive through as I've done at many Sonics places at other locations and just grab a lime slush aid. However this must have been the most complicated order ever for her.  Drive-through attendant made me wait forever just to open the window and then got upset when I was trying to communicate my order correctly.  Apparently she doesn't care about the customers wants."}
{"text":"If you've read any of my reviews, you know I like my fries well done. Sonic does a fabulous job of cooking their tots well done. They are awesome! I also like their mini banana split. Just right!"}
{"text":"It is about 1:45am and I am a thirsty thirsty girl. This Sonic advertises a 2am close time and right as I pulled in the drive-thru they flipped the lights off and have disappeared. All I wanted was a darn drink. How difficult is that? I've now been sitting at the drive-thru window for about 10 min, still no sign of the cowardly employees who flipped off the lights and have vanished into thin air.
SO DISAPPOINTED!!!"}
{"text":"The cherry limeade does not taste as good as I remember it. There was also no cherry. It's been a while since I've had one but I remember they used to put a cherry in there. Oh well. The customer service was good I didn't have any problems at the drive thru, but they don't taste like they used to."}
{"text":"We were lucky and got a trainee at the drive-in who took so long to respond to our questions we thought he was gone. Another car came, ordered, ate and left before we even finished our order. Then it arrived with errors. 

The tater tots were crispy but tasted like the grease it was fried in. No salt, no nothing. The onion rings were crispy to the point of being hard, and had NO flavor. NONE. I won't bore you with the other underwhelming items. The brightest spot was the friendly server. We gave her a tip and she said, \"cool.\" I guess tips must be expected. 

We won't be coming back. The best thing about Sonic are the commercials."}
{"text":"I was disappointed! I love the commercials showing wth pretzel sandwiches, hotdogs, shakes and umpteen types of drinks. Since we didn't have Sonic back home (Ohio) we were all excited about our first taste. 

Ok, maybe Walmart isn't the best place to experience a restaurant, but that's where we saw it. Between the two of us we tried the hot dog, fries, cheeseburger, and peanut butter milkshake. 

Nothing special- even the peanut butter shake was underwhelming. Nothing was bad- it was just normal fast food fare when we expected a cut above. Oh, well. We still like the commercials!"}
{"text":"Worst sonic ever! I just went for 2 drinks, I was the only person in line and I waited 15 min. I came with my boyfriend last week and got 2 orders of wings ( again, the only people in line) and we waited over 25 min. This place needs to get it together!"}
{"text":"I am a total fan of their drinks....and even a bigger fan of being able to get large drinks for 99 cents before noon and they are half price every day between 2-4pm.  
Their slushes are my favorite (lemon-berry especially) but occasionally I have to get a cherry lime...for ol' times sake...
This is one of the few places that can make me a pineapple malt when I am in need.

You can stop in at 9am and get breakfast or their burgers...they offer their full menu all day.  Their food is ok.  Often I get a craving for some tater tots or their french toast sticks.  More often than not I order one of their kids packs with a slush and go on my merry way...."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience in the drive thru. Cars parked in line with their engines off. 4 Staff members playing inside store. The only person that was actually working was the guy on skates. 30min stuck in line, burnt food, cold food & horrible service."}
{"text":"20 minutes for 3 blasts is completely ridiculous. We didn't order anything off the grill or anything that requires frying, just ice cream. And for every employee to ignore us the entire time we sat at the drive-thru window was a joke. We won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. This by far is the absolute worst experience I've ever had at sonic. I've been going to sonic since I was a child, it's one of my favorites but this will be my last time. The service was atrocious, the woman who took my order was rushed, rude, and wouldn't let me speak - she was condescending and smart with me. I was hoping it'd get better when they brought our food however, I was sorely mistaken. This young guy comes out gives us our food and looks like he could give two cheese burgers about his job. We ask for ketchup and he sighs real big, throws his arms down and and says \"fine I'll go get it I guess.\" You guess?! And are we 5 that we pitch fits and stomp off? Ha, sir you are the definition of adult child aka the reason millennials have a bad name. Not the mention our drink cups had cracks in them and the food was barely mediocre. The commercials are better to watch than their food is to eat."}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars! The night crew is RUDE and acts like you're putting them out when you order! I've been told multiple time that this or that is down or broken because they don't want to make it! Never going back! No Idea who I think it will be better the next time!"}
{"text":"What is the deal with this location? About two months ago, we came here two weeks in a row and went through the drive-thru. The wait in the drive thru for food was 20 minutes. Multiple wrong items in our order that we didn't discover until leaving. 

Yesterday, we tried again. 20 minutes in the drive-thru. No kids meal for my daughter. No drink. For my son. Cheese on the plain hot dog. The car hop was surly and rude. Seemed very annoyed that she had to return to get the other items. 

The employees at this Sonic clearly do not give any fucks. Sucks cause I do like the food/drinks there."}
{"text":"Why do they always have Sonic commercials, but there are no Sonic Drive-In's near Los Angeles proper?  Boo!

When I go to Vegas, I get very excited for a few things:

Buffets
Partying
Tanning
Sonic

This is not the best food ever, but I have enjoyed just about everything I've tried from Sonic.  In terms of fast food, they really hit it on the mark.

If you've never been before, I highly recommend getting:

Tater Tots
Popcorn Chicken
Breakfast Burrito (with salsa)
French Toast Sticks
Slushies!!  (My faves are Super Peach Ring and Lemonberry Fruit Slush)

I can order from the comforts of my air conditioned car.  Then a cute high school kid will come rollerskating to the car with all the deliciously fried foods and sugary goodness filled drinks.

This is obviously not somewhere for you to go every day.  But, for a late night after club drunchie fest?  Sonic Drive-In is perfecto."}

{"text":"Horrible and will not be going back. We were given cold food that clearly was not fresh and the soda tasted funky. Waited 20+ minutes for our food and then recieve cold crappy food. Very disappointing since its usually good at this location but this left a bad bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"We decided to come here after a night of gambling.  We're from Hawaii so all we know of this place is what's in the commercials.

We were pleasantly surprised  with the drive in style set up.  A parking lot full of speakers and menus.  AND the best part....your order is delivered to you by a guy/gal on roller skates.  I love it!

The food was good...I had the chicken sandwich with the texas toast.  YUM.  Husband had the tater tots which he lalalalaloved.

I would definitely go back...if anything to see the food being delivered via rollerskates LOL."}

Always takes forever, drive thru or pull in.

The master blasts are never blended. Bottom half is always just plain ice cream.

Today, 10/4/16 went and ordered another two iced coffees, I had to repeat my order 3 times, car hopper came out to take our order and still got my order wrong. I am ok with waiting as long as my order is correct and satisfying. I received my coffee and it tasted like water with syrup. I sent it back and they left without an explanation. I called the car hopper and told her I did not pay for my coffee and she said, \"Yes you did.\" I then said, \"Where is my refund since I do not want this coffee?\" She told me she couldn't give me one. Excuse me? Car hopper was not happy and finally asked for my card, had to cancel the entire order and charge me for the one coffee. I asked for a discount or a free coffee (the one I was going to purchase for a friend) and she said no. I was speechless. I will not be going back to the Sonic in Avondale. NO customer service."}

I am saving my 5 star reviews for unreal places and Hanover eateries I want to stay in business."}

I was waiting for my order to be placed so I kindly told the manager I have a location equal distance to my houses went there and the drive thru was out the lot and almost every drive up had a car...pulled in and they took my order in less than 2 minutes.  The manager said these kids these days....no..I have a teen and he would never disrespect an adult especially in a customer service atmosphere.(happened today)"}

I was in the mood for a sundae and went to grab one for me
And a friend of mine.  When I mentioned the special price they said they werent 
Offering that price. Once I explained it was a text/club prIce they asked me to pull forward.

After all 4 employees looked at my text message and they had their little pow wow they decided to give me the price.

When they handed me my sundaes, honest to God they basically took one sundae and split it into two! 

So they scammed me but whatever !

I will Think twice about this location the next time I want to make an ice cream run!

I mean
Come on, even at half price sonic your not losing and dinero dayum"}

People next to is pulled up and ordered already. So we back out and go into another menu same thing waited about 2 min then they finally answered I asked is one of you menu broken? They said nope. So I told them what happens and we been waiting for 5-8 mins for someone to answer then they said o yeah one of the menus is broken. So I'm like alright and we ordered room about 15 min till our order came and that's when we were in a rush. Another time my bf ordered chili cheese fries they gave him what looked/tasted like plastic cold cheese fries and my strawberry limeade had way to many strawberry chunks in it I felt like I didn't even drunk anything mostly ate the strawberries and could really taste some syrup Idk it was too sweet! They need to retrain or idk but they been messing up a lot. Not gonna go here again"}
{"text":"Hi my name is Caitlyn. I ordered a footlong coney dog from Sonic on 40th st and greenway phoenix, AZ about 20 minutes ago and the cheese wasn't even on the dog. First of all I received my dog upside down and then was super displeased to see that all the cheese stuck to the packaging. Not to mention I had to push the order button 5 separate times for them to finally take my order. I stood waiting in front of the walk up screen for about 7 minutes until finally someone took my order. They didn't even apologize for making me wait..not pleased one bit. Won't be returning to this location or ordering any sort of dog again from you guys."}

{"text":"I always wonder whyyyyy they show some commercials in LA County. Ruby Tuesday. Dunkin' Donuts. Cici's Pizza. Sonic. Us Angelinos, sometimes we don't know any better. We see this shit on TV and the actors are believable and the food looks yummy and everything is all rainbows and flowers. Truth is, we're like idiots in a library: Clueless. It gets worse once we travel out of state and come across these 'As Seen on TV' establishments...

\"SONICCCCC! Ohhhhhhh, make a U-turn and let's go!\"

That's how the conversation went awry as my friends and I cruised through Vegas one hot summer night. We pulled up, parked, and looked over the menu. It was like the Land of Oz - everything looked amazing! And not because it was amazing, but because we just don't have Sonic in LA. The little carhop girls were skating around. Between the enticing menu and the roller skates we were all like ADD kids not knowing what to order or where to focus our eyes. So far, Sonic was cool!

Cool didn't last long once the food arrived. 1 word: salty! I swore I thought I was going to develop hypertension after eating here. The hot-dog was ok, nothing special. But the tater tots that we were oh so excited to get, were just littered with salt. We all thought there were just way too salty to enjoy. The cherry slushy drink was nice 'n sweet (which meant I might become diabetic also!), and overall the meal made for a decent late-night snack. Sadly, Sonic will not be on my list of places to stop in when I see them outside of LA.

(Ruby Tuesday and Cici, please don't let me down when I come to your town.)"}
{"text":"Ok, I am officially in love with Sonic!!

I ate here a twice while visiting in Vegas (I know so bad) and all times were fantabulously delicious!!!

The only other time I had tried Sonic was in Redding, CA. I had there grilled chicken sandwich that was actually really good though, I was anxiously looking forward to try one of there actual burgers, especially after hearing they were comparable to In N Out.

This particular sonic has all the outside drive in areas to sit and order your food along with an actual drive through window as well. The service at this particular location seemed to always be exceptionally friendly and upbeat on my visits.

My first visit I ordered a junior cheeseburger which was actually a pretty decent size for a Jr and mmm....was it .incredibly delicious!! I had also had one of there breakfast burritos one morning to, which was extremely tasty and quite filling.

Yes In N out, I would have to say Sonic has won me over!!

This is another place we are missing in the Bay area...and another place that is already missed!!"}
{"text":"In March 2017 I was craving mozzarella sticks  no one seems to top it better then sonic, I was 6 months pregnant and this one was the closest to me. I pulled in to one of there stops 10 minutes before they closed and i pushes the button and the screen said we will.be right with u, then it changed to say push the button again and It did it again, so I went to another one thinking maybe its the machine, it was already 5  till they closed, and then after i hit that button about a minute after they turned off there lights. I understand u want to go home early I do, but seriously if u didn't want to serve me u could have just said \"we are closing early\" that way I could have go to a different before it closed. Instead waisted 10 minutes of my time not easy sense I had worked that day And wanted to be off my feet, because I was 6onths pregnant,  And they must have know i was there because i stand outside my car door when I push the button.  :("}
{"text":"This is the second time I went to this sonic on Greenfield and Brown that when I ordered a medium cream slush they were \"OUT OF MEDIUM CUPS.\"  This is BS. This place thrives on selling drinks and they are out of Medium Cups??!!  I think it is a ploy to get customers to buy a large drink.  What they should do is give customers a large drink at Medium prices."}
{"text":"Absolute worst location ever. Over 30 mins waiting in the drive thru for a burger!! The guy ahead of me took a while to order so I shrugged it off assuming he had a large order to fill. An employee came out and handed drinks only to the car behind me and he drove away. When the employee handed the car ahead of me the smallest bag possible, I couldn't help but ask as I pulled up to the window. She apologized for the wait to which I asked what the wait was for. She told me she had to wait for his food and would have to wait for mine as well! I told her to keep it and drove away. This is by far the WORST sonic I've ever been to! Not a single other location, in Las Vegas or another state, has EVER taken that long to fill an order. I am sure this is not sonic standards. Will not go back and will make sure anyone asking for sonic does not go to this location. It's no wonder I never see many people at this location. Now I know..."}

{"text":"First off, we pull up and see the workers slacking off right off the bat. We order 2 large slushies, and 1 small. The taste of them was kinda weak at first, then by the time it's jus under half way full, tastes like nothing but slush. No flavor. Pissed"}
{"text":"This is, without a doubt, the worst Sonic location I have ever had the sad displeasure to patron. How hard is it to leave the mayo off the burger? Besides the fact it clearly says \"mayonnaise is the condiment of Satan\" in the Bible, every American knows that it's taboo. I also have a undercover brother mentality when it comes to mayo. Gross. But I digress...let me just say I literally stated NO MAYO, no less than three times during the course of my order...sadly, when I arrived at home, salivating over my eagerly anticipated burger, I was completely broad sided by approximately 1 full tablespoon, not teaspoon, of the Devils discharge adorning my pathetic excuse of sustenance. Needless to say, after pressure washing the truck load of disgusting off my burger and rinsing the pickles in Muratic acid, I threw it away...thanks Sonic for ruining my hopes, desires, and probably the rest of my burger eating life..."}
{"text":"The only thing I like about Sonic is their drinks.

I'm not a fan of drive up eateries like Sonic, A&W, and Swensons.  Sonic is not different.  Greasy, messy food at a large cost that you could get better somewhere else.  They have prompt service, easy payment at the location so no one takes your card, and they are friendly.  Food tastes decent enough, but small servings for the cost.  I was unhappy with kids selection choices, but my 2 boys found the chicken kids meals tasty enough.  You have privacy since you eat in your car and the noise level is up to you, but they don't give you enough napkins or wet wipes for their messy food.  They are willing to cook to order though and do substitutions and additions so that is a plus."}
{"text":"Stellar work folks, with only 5 repeats of my 4 item order, you have really gone that extra distance to take pride and care in your work. 

No Onions- Doesn't take a Rocket Surgeon. Especially when it says it in the ticket. 

Apparently \"Lite Ice\" is a difficult thing. 
Not \"lemon ice\"
Not \"cherry lime\" 
Not \"A cup still half full of ice once drink is gone\"

I take my kids through drive throughs and use it as a teaching moment. I use these experiences to encourage them to learn to pay attention and listen to people.  And to double check their work."}

My only regret is that I didn't get a larger size."}
{"text":"Food is fairly good. Just disappoint in my hotdog the bun was looking and tasting mushy and doughy(that's only happened once). And they seem to always take forever..."}
{"text":"Not really one to write a review on a fast-food place, because hey, it's fast-food. However, this location GLORIOUSLY warrants one consistent with it's overall dumbfounded incompetent fumbling service.

I've gone here three separate times in the past few weeks for a quick bite via the drive-thru. 

First time, order was incorrect. I ordered a (#3) double-cheeseburger with bacon, tots and a large fountain drink. Once home, I realized I had received a single cheese-burger (not double as it should be). Eh whatever, I said. Didn't let it bother me this one time. But wait, there's more!

Second time, I ordered the exact same thing, this time, even mentioning my last visit to the employee at the window who \"ensured\" me everything was accurate in the bag before driving off. Of course, everything should be fine now after directly communicating an order mix-up upon last visit, right? Hell nah, you cray-cray (that's slang for crazy - or so I've heard). I get home, open the bag and instead of a double-cheeseburger with bacon, it's a plain double-cheeseburger -- no bacon, no sauce and nothing on it besides cheese. Haha, what? This time, I called and spoke to the same employee who was apologetic and put my name down in what they describe as, \"the book\".

Third time, I go back to have the last order repeated informing them of my name and situation so they can look me up in, \"the book\" (questionable smirk). When I get home and look inside the bag I have straight up french-fries, instead of tots, Now, I don't know exactly who out there in their right mind goes to Sonic to order french-fries when they're known for their tater-tots, but I had fries, when I explicitly said tots. I put this one on me since I could've simply peeked inside the bag before driving off. However, when I got home I did call back and gave them an ear-full because ya know, how hard is it?

At any rate, I'm not sure what the hell is going on at this location, but proceed at your own risk. Or at least, if you're using the drive-thru make sure you pull-over after receiving your items, open the bag and examine your food as if you're writing an essay to the President because these folks just can't seem to follow basic instructions and get it done right, even when they say they've gotten it done right! 

Other things I've notice about this particular location is:

- Always dirty: Trash laying around everywhere on the premises. In the parking stalls, the drive-thru lane, where the bushes are, in and around the gutters. I mean, everywhere. Nobody seems to have any pride in the overall \"look\" of the place outside, so I kinda have to imagine what's going on inside a space no bigger than a car.

- Staff are zombies: The employee's here have just given up and have really unpleasant attitudes, at least, every time I've been. You would expect a place where employees get to ride around on roller-skates that it would be a cheerful and happy atmosphere? Nope, not here. Everyone seems down and out.

- Drive-thru intercom fail: Either you can never hear the employee speaking thru the intercom or they can never hear you. Be prepared to scream your order from your car as if you're in boot camp sounding off for a drill instructor.

- Lastly, orders are never accurate. Read from beginning.

I won't be returning here ever again."}

{"text":"I always love Sonic's Slushies and dogs, since the new variety's came out I had been wanting to give them a try.  After a long night waiting at the airport and making multiple trips picking up a friend and parts of her family, I stopped here on the way home for a quick bite I had the Kicking' Coney with out chipotle BBQ Sauce and a cranberry slush.  My slush was excellent as usual but I must say that I prefer the regular old chili cheese coney dog!  I didn't care for the texture of the hot dog itself, service was great even though it was a really busy night they got it out as quick as they could."}
{"text":"This place sucks. They are always rude and they are SO SLOW. They also like to play on their phones while we can see them rather than actually make our drink. Also why are all the lights off? They have like NO LIGHTS ON so they look closed when they are clearly during business hours. I wouldn't walk around here alone at night. Avoid at all costs. Fire the douches working and start anew. The receipt said Ananbell but I think her name was Annabell and she was in the WORST mood. She had no emotion and didn't explain why the shakes were no longer half price when we asked why it was so expensive. She was rude the entire transaction."}
{"text":"Bust.  That's what this place is; a total bust.  Seeing commercials of Sonic, but none within a 50 mile radius, I had to stop by when I was in Sin City.  The service was kind of sloppy, a little slow and not attentive when asking for ketchup.  I was hungry so i dug into my fries ketchupless.  Not quite as satisfying if America's favorite condiment had accompanied the fries.  The food was pretty mediocre.  Nothing really to rave about and was a disappointment."}
{"text":"If i could give zero stars i would.  Went for a quick ice cream fix as we do once a month or so and we left our place at 11:45 get there by my cell time at 11:53.  we wait a couple mins they tell us they are closed at 11:55...  I don't know who runs this location, but their ethics are not business oriented.  They've messed up our order twice now and this was the final straw.  On e time a couple months ago we came to get oreo blasts and when we tasted it they were soggy and old.  Another time they mixed up topping with snickers and m&ms didnt match what was mixed in.  I know things happen, but repeated incompetence gets old.

{"text":"For an establishment that serves fast food, I can't figure out why it took over 15 minutes to get a slush drink. To top it off, I'm not if the staff is short right now, but multiple cars have been telling the employees that their orders are incorrect. I enjoy a snack every now and then from Sonic but won't bother wasting time at this location again"}
{"text":"Happy Hour From 2_4 but they also have a AM Happy Hour too which is beneficial for people who people who typically work morning shifts"}
{"text":"I am honestly shocked by the good reviews but I guess I am glad others have a better experience here.

Hadn't been to this location in over 3 years due to mediocre service and food. Went today to see if anything has changed. Nope.

Gave us tots instead of fries. Made the Slush Floats were ordered weird... it's suppose to be a slush with ice cream inside UNBLENDED. If this is how they make them now... um... alright. They did not add my mom's petezel dog despite telling them the order repeatedly and when we pushed the button to correct this we were met with nothing but some rude guy. Pretzel dogs with bacon and cheese are suppose to have bacon bits. They gave us a big ole slice of bacon across the dog. Makes it harder to eat. Why I am not surprised that they are too lazy to cut up the bacon slices like in the picture.

Goodbye forever, Sonic."}
{"text":"You will find me at this Sonic on most Thursdays after 2:00pm. I'm the designated driver for the office to get drinks during happy hour here.  You can get half-off on all Slushes, Limeades, Teas, and Sodas from 2-4pm but note this does not apply to their Milk Shakes or Creamslushes. A true drive-in, just park, place your order on the speaker, and soon your order is brought to you by one of the staff who still roll around on skates without dropping any of the drinks.  Aside from the happy hours, my favorite Sonic items are the tater tots with fry sauce and blended root beer floats."}
{"text":"Ahh, I haven't been to Sonic in a while, but I met up with a friend here recently to catch up on some girl talk and chill out.  We parked and sat at one of the tables at dusk, with a nice breeze blowing.  I sipped on a large iced tea with extra ice and watched as she ate a chicken finger meal; she'd never been to Sonic even though she's been in Vegas longer than me (I've been here since 1992!)

KUDOS:
- They have two food items on the menu that I used to get all the time, but not so much any more:  root beer floats that you can request to be blended when you order (that's how I like 'em); and, tater tots. You can get the special fry sauce for the tater tots and fries, a combo of mayo and ketchup.  My son and I would come through the drive-thru at least once a week for blended root beer floats back in the day. It's comfort food, for sure, and oh so good!  
- The ice they put in their drinks is crushed, but there's something special, I don't know what it is.  It's so popular that they even sell it by the bag. 
- Sonic still has the old-school park and eat concept.  You can pull up, park, order over the intercom, and your order is brought out by someone on skates.
- Happy Hour for the drinks, of which there are plenty to choose from:  slushes, limeades, sodas, sweet or unsweetened iced teas (regular or green). 2:00-4:00pm

GRIPES:
- Really not healthy for you, but, hey, you don't come to Sonic to eat healthy.  Come here for some greasy burgers, hot dogs, corn dogs, fries, tater tots, sundaes, floats, and anything else that will make you feel good when you need that kind of comfort."}

{"text":"My wife went last night and ordered a couple green chili bacon cheese burger combos to bring home. She ordered them without tomato and onion and when she got home sure enough, tomatoes and a lot of onions were on the burgers. The receipt that was taped onto the bag confirmed that they got the order right, just someone wasn't paying attention. We called and was offered to return and they would replace the sandwiches, but I asked what they would do for the inconvenience of us having to go back out because they messed up our order and they manager said there was nothing he could do, that is just poor customer service. So when she got there, she also ordered a couple milk shakes and this would have been an opportunity for the manager to say \"I am really sorry we screwed up your order, the shakes are on me for the mistake\", but no, any knowledge of customer service is definitely not displayed here.

Then when she returned with the replacement sandwiches and mine had a few pieces of onion mixed in with the lettuce which leads me to believe that they keep a messy work station at the prep table and aren't careful of mixing the veggies when making food. 

I remember the day when customer service was the #1 priority for businesses and if something like this happened, you wouldn't even have to ask for something for the inconvenience, they would just have offered to make things right. They need some serious training on food prep and making sure that every person leaves their establishment satisfied, it really is an easy thing to do and pays off in the long run, also would have gotten a different review here."}

I'm not from the 50's/60's but the atmosphere and great service takes you back, back to when people were cheerful and happy."}
{"text":"Being a former employee of sonic I know how busy it can get. But there is something to be said when you can't even get a simple Sunday out to a customer in 15 minutes. Especially when there's only three other cars in the lot at 10 o'clock at night. And to make things worse not even an apology for the wait time."}
{"text":"Worst company in the face of the planet. I ordered food for my wife and I on our date night and they wouldn't even accept cards! They said it had to be done in cash. After we waited all that time for our food we had to just leave it! The employee was horribly mean and was making fun of us for not having cash. Never go here! On top of all that it took them 25 minutes to get our food out. They told us it would be a 5 minute wait because of the boneless chicken wings but it took 5x longer!! Seriously the worst customer service ever and I will never come to this location again. I might not even go to any sonic after all this."}
{"text":"They take way too long to take your order. We sat waiting for about 15 minutes before we even were attended to. The food took forever to come out. We probably waited about another 20-25 minutes for our food. On top of that the quantity of mozzarella sticks and tater tots was so small in comparison to other places I've been to. I would not recommend this place to anyone"}

{"text":"Incredibly slow service. It took us 10 minutes from start to finish to get 2 slushies and 1 Coke in the drive-thru at 3:30 p.m. on a Friday ... and there was NO ONE in front of us. 

Unfortunately, slow service is the norm here and we only ever order drinks. My kids always laugh about the Sonic poster that says something to the effect of \"We wait on you, not the other way around,\" because it's so clearly the opposite at this particular Sonic location.

Just a note: the service at the Sonic in Sun Prairie is so much better."}
{"text":"I am only writing this review because of a great staff member, not the food or company. Deshawn was very nice and accommodating. He made my boyfriend and I laugh,  and he even gave us tickets to a car event coming to Las Vegas.  This guy deserves a raise! 

Also,  the popcorn chicken small is sooooooo tiny. Had like 4 pieces in it! Like 4$ Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I had never been to a sonic and was looking for something quick to eat... We pulled into one of the one of the drive up menus and ordered.  The ordering process was pretty painless and we sat and waited for them to come bring our order/take our money.. That part was a little confusing as they \"buzzed\" the car but said nothing.. Our food was delivered and boy am i glad my sister wanted to stop here! I got the cheese steak and fries and there are no complaints from this girl! My only complaint at all is i highly dislike when places use ice chips.. its a personal preference of mine so i cant say much, just that cubes are a lot better."}
{"text":"Way more fun visiting Sonic as a backsliding vegetarian. Roxy and I got the bacon cheeseburger, chili cheese tots and a lime chiller(which is like a shake). The burger was better than the Whopper I had a few weeks ago, but not gourmet like the thick kind you get at a bar(aka arm sandwich). The tots were great! Never been a fan of tots, but tonight they hit a home run. 
Speaking of baseball, Shin Soo Choo should live out here. Drunk driving is not only tolerated, but encouraged in Parma. it's like their version of triathlons. Drink, smoke and drive! The service was very friendly, quick and sadly, not on roller skates. Great way to break in the summer!"}
{"text":"First time I've ever tried a Sonic and, after this experience, it may probably also be my last. It took approximately 45 minutes for our orders to come out, and the only reason why it even ever got to us was because we asked where the hell it was. Turns out they had completely forgotten about it because they ~suddenly got busy~. By busy, they referred to a drive-thru line that went from non-existent to normal length and back to non-existent in the duration of our wait. Basically, it was not busy at all, rather just an average- to less-than-average-sized fast-food crowd and a set of incompetent staff. Given the lukewarm temperature of our food, we inferred that our orders were promptly prepared, but were forgotten soon after and left out to get cold. You'd think that an employee with some rationale would run into these eventually and say, \"Hey! Who's order is this? Why is it just sitting out here?\"

One star is granted as mercy for the manager who refunded us as meager compensation for our atrocious experience here. I can say with considerable conviction that one of my greatest regrets in life is passing over In-n-Out this one time to try this sorry excuse of a \"fast\"-food joint."}
{"text":"Ah, Sonic. I always forget about them.  But they have decent fast food.  I had the chicken strip dinner and it was delicious.  Also, I love how they have the girls deleiver your food on roller skates.  So 1950s.  Awesome."}
{"text":"You let me order TWO times before telling me..\"uhhh...our ice cream maker is kinda down right now\". Poor service & rude."}
{"text":"We ordered 1 drink and 2 ice creams and waited for 20 mins!!!! And then asked an employee what was going on and she looked like a deer in headlights!! Had no clue! Then this car pulls up to drop off an employee and another employee starts bringing them all kinds of drinks!!! WTH are u serious! And I'm sure they we're getting it for free!! But us paying customers couldn't get NOTHING!! Terrible service! Well what can you except when it's only kids working there!!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour 2-5pm
Diet Cherry Limeade! I love it!!! So good! Great service and love happy hour. Def a stop all summer long!"}
{"text":"Not in the greatest area of Vegas but I've never been dissatisfying here.  The food is always fresh and fast. The service is always friendly and upbeat!! The parking lot is always clean and the garbage cans are never full!!"}
{"text":"Great place! I've never been disappointed here. My father loves this place, every time we are all together \"let's get a sonic\"  is always said."}
{"text":"Poorly managed. Came here to pick up something quick for lunch one day, for the drive thru was long and was barely moving. The line was literally blocking other customers from backing out the drive in spots. Took over 20 min to get my food thru a drive thru, so much for a half hour lunch, couldn't even make it back to my office in time or even eat. Avoid this location at all costs until they get staffed appropriately or manage their lines better. Would hate to be stuck in the drive in stall and can't get out"}
{"text":"I love Sonic! My family and I are here almost all the time. But we mainly go for the shakes and slushies that they serve here and not the food. I don't like the food as much mainly because it's really greasy and oily, and it's just average tasting. There's nothing really to rave about when it comes to their food/food selections. However, their shakes and slushies.. Good golly! There are so many selection of flavors to choose from. You can even concoct your own mixture of flavors! My favorite to get is always the Oreo chocolate milkshake and their strawberry (and orange) cream slush. When it comes to shakes and slushies, this place beats them all."}
{"text":"Kids corn dogs were beyond well done today and they provided no condiments, nor did they ask if we needed them."}
{"text":"Seriously If I could give no stars or a 1/2 star I would!!  This place sucks!!  I understand it's new but then they need better management!  Waited 10 min in drive thru just to give our order then they got the whole order wrong....forgot drinks and kept asking us what we ordered.  Now on to the food...the onion rings tasted like cotton candy, really don't know it that's normal for them or not.  My Chicago Hot dog was cold and they put it in the bag on it's end so all the toppings sunk to the bottom of the bag.  What a mess...prices are too high for bad service and bad food.  WE WILL NEVER 
GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"Currently in line. It's 10:32pm. Got here at 10pm. Slowest service on earth. Ordered a milkshake and a sprite zero. I'm pretty sure they are milking the cow to use to make the ice cream for my shake. Avoid at all costs. I'm actually upset I have to give 1 star. There needs to be an option to give negative stars. It is now 10:40pm. I'm leaving. F this."}
{"text":"They charged me 20 cents for a glass of water, which would have normally been fine, but they did it only AFTER giving me the total for the order.  It is NOT okay to try to charge me a different total at the curb than I was quoted at.  He explained that he can't give me a free glass of water unless its a small (which is what I assumed I was getting since we didn't discuss any sort of upgrade).

On top of that, I had a coupon and he quoted me what should've been the correct amount for the coupon but on the receipt it was 10 cents more.  So much for bringing in a coupon.

So, Sonic, here's your horrible review for a dispute over 30 cents. I hope it was worth it for you."}
{"text":"Probably the best Sonic I've ever been to - and I've been to them in at least 4 states. My sister said she loves this location because they make their tater tots extra crispy.

After going to the disgusting, smoke-laden and not poppin' Strip last night, my sister and I drove over here. We split the popcorn chicken meal with tater tots (she had the drink to herself because I had my trusty water bottle with me.) There was more than enough food in this single meal for us to split.

Service was decently fast and with a tip, $8.50 isn't too bad for two people to eat. The fact it's open 24 hours is FABULOUS! 

(6/19/11 - review moved because it was at the wrong location's listing!)"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is my favorite.  Food is good but they always have new staff at this location and I had to wait 45 minutes for one drink and 6 cars drove away because the wait is always so long.  They need to figure out the wait time before they don't have any more customers.   I started going go to a different Sonic even though this one is right down the street from me."}
{"text":"Always fast service even if the line is long and they make the best tasting drinks.  Best friendly service and they keep the place very clean.  I drive to this Sonic because the one by my house takes a hour waiting in line just for one drink."}
{"text":"Great staff and food:-). 
They make super great slushies, go to sonic 2-4pm to get half off"}
{"text":"Love the food, thus why i come back to sonic time and time out. Love the deals they run and the text messages they send out with specials. However this location could not get it together. The young woman on the intercom could not hear me and then when she did there was 2 minute pause while i heard the background workers and then she would ask me something else. when i was leaving i asked for a receipt so i could se what i was charged for and she said oh i dont have it they all print out of this machine and shows me a pile of receipts. I could not take a survey on their web site because i had no receipt. This location is by far one of the worst i have been too, and that says a lot since every sonic seems to always have a long wait for a simple thing as a drink."}
{"text":"Love the drink variety. Half price happy hour and all.the little things they do . However today I waited 20 minutes from start to finish in the drive through . I know it was happy hour , but that's a long wait for a drink . May not go back to this location ."}
{"text":"Ordered the #11, 3pc chicken strips with tots, onion rings and Texas toast... Needless to say I was thoroughly disappointed. The chicken tenders took less than 2 minutes from order to my car, which surprised me until I wondered how long it's been sitting out since it's obviously not fresh. Then I remembered I ordered the #11 and not JUST the chicken... I didn't even get the tots, onion rings and Texas toast. I pushed the red button again and asked for it and these actually took longer than the chicken took. I only got ONE onion ring, a slice of Wonder Bread popped in the toaster for 15 seconds and a handful of tots that also tasted like they've been sitting out all day (needless to say I only ordered at 11:30am)."}
{"text":"*Customer Service 1/2 Stars, For the most part they are usually good with being nice and providing good customer service. 

*Experience 0/1 Star,Definitely should go to a drive in stall and avoid the drive thru at all costs. I go here frequently compared to other places around here and they tend to mess the order more than they should be. Be sure to check your order before leaving.  

*Food 1/1, only reason I'm giving Sonic a star here is because when my order is correct the food is good for a fast food place. Better then some of the competitors for sure.

*Would I Recommend 1/1 Star, This was tough due to the lack of positive experiences here but I will because they have a wide variety of things like slushes and so much more."}
{"text":"All of the sonics are slow. It's their charm I guess. The side effect of cooking fresh food? Hmm. 
I love the diet cherry limeades but sometimes waiting more than 5 minutes for one isn't worth my time. 
They have some crazy concoction of drinks and mocktails-ha! and they are only worth the cash during happy hour. 
I switched it up yesterday and got the frozen cherry limeade and I swear my teeth almost disintegrated. I tried to cut it with some water but it was way to sweet and gave me a headache. Never straying from the DCL again. 
I have ordered a grilled cheese from this location -it was pretty standard not bad or praise worthy. 
I don't really like the drive thru situation - the workers have to walk all the way outside to get the money and give your food. If you pay with a card it take even more time since they have to go all the way back in to run it. It's 2015 can we fix this? They have the card readers on the stalls at other places -c'mon. 
They had a fire a few months ago and I tried to get a DCL before work and they were closed but a worker came out and handed me a voucher for a FREE medium drink. Score! Not their fault for the fire but it was nice of them to do this for their customers trying to get their sonic on."}
{"text":"Nothing major to get right or wrong on our last visit, just a couple shakes, normally have to repeat myself when ordering or requesting condiments as the staff either doesn't listen or doesn't care about what you ask for.

The shakes were delicious, and mixed well."}
{"text":"This location has been a staple to my lunch list of places to eat, depending on where I am working. Generally, good service, and standard Sonic quality.

Today, I ordered, could barely hear the order taker, luckily, my order was right! A definite rarity. Their machine asked if I wanted to pay by card, which I did, unfortunately it did not want to accept my debit card. Oh well, tossed another one in the machine... a half dozen times, before I was able to pay.

It seemed like mere seconds before my special order burger, drink and tots mmmm delicious, savory tots were delivered by a roller skate enabled car hop.

Took off back to the office, scarfed down my burger, enjoyed tots with fry sauce, which if you have not had it, is a must! And drank the soda too quick so I could savor the crunchy ice."}
{"text":"Arrived at sonic and ordered two kids meal. Fries were cold and the Juicebox was missing. This was at the drive up. And we asked for hot fries they basically took cold fries and refried them. The worst"}
{"text":"I LOVE Sonic.  I was raised in San Diego, and we didn't have any Sonics, so I was super excited to see them all over town here.  This is the location closest to my house, so it's the one I visit most often.

I have never had bad service here.  All of the order takers and servers are friendly.  The burgers are nothing spectacular, but are good.  I love that you have the option to have tater tots, more fast food places should offer them as well!

The drinks are the best part.  I love that you can customize your soda to add any flavor combination.  There is nothing like a raspberry limeade on a hot day! :)

The desserts are also pretty delicious.  The best time of year is when they have the red velvet cake blast.  I wish they carried it year around.  :(  The pumpkin pie blast is also a really good seasonal treat.

I do wish that they were open 24 hours, but I believe they are open fairly late, until 1am most nights"}
{"text":"I've never had high hopes for Sonic, but I thought perhaps they would have improved over the years. All I learned today is that ordering a meal with onion rings at Sonic will yield you precisely one onion ring, and it will disappoint you. I am now also privy to the fact that if you upgrade your drink as part of a meal combo, it will not be a dollar or two up-charge. It will be the full price of the item, minus a four cent credit. Tater tots were stale, chicken fingers were microscopic, and my hopes are genuinely dashed. I know it's Sonic, but c'mon. There are faster food options out there that I would gladly vouch for. Unfortunately, this restaurant (term used very loosely) is not one of them, and will do nothing but disappoint."}
{"text":"My cousin who lives in Vegas has it made. He bought a HUGE house with a pool for PEANUTS and he has a SONIC burger right down the street from him. WTF! I love their burgers and specialty drinks. It's so easy to get fat with all the great breakfast and lunch selections they have. Wish they opened more Sonic joints in SoCal. Heard they got one in Anaheim. But how often do I go to Anaheim? I love how you order your food at this place. It's like buying gas and they bring the food to your car. Pretty cool. There used to be drive-ins in SoCal (like A&W) but they've all gone."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars.

I returned to Sonic after my first review because I saw a bunch of people sitting in the outdoor seating area, and I thought, \"Maybe they got their act together.\"

I went through the drive-thru to get a large Cherry-Limeade--probably the best thing Sonic does.  I didn't order anything else.  That was all--one large Cherry-Limeade.  The dude on the drive-thru mic asked me if I wanted to make a Route 44 size for ten cents more.  I love a good upsell as much as anyone--sold, my friend.

I pulled forward and there was only one car in line in front of me.  It was parked at the window.  I pulled up and waited.

And waited.

And waited.

After 5 minutes, I thought about pulling away, but figured I'd gut it out if for no other reason than this review.

So I waited some more.

And waited.

And waited...  

After thirteen minutes--yes: 1 3 m i n u t e s....Thirteen long, dull, pointless minutes where there was no interaction at all at the window.  Two other cars were stacked up behind me. I could tell from the body language that the girls in the car in front of me were angry.

Finally, someone shows up at the window and starts passing bags of food through to the two girls in front of me.  It was at least six or seven bags, and a four-carrier of shakes.  

I'm sorry--if you have a large drive-thru order like that, you pull the car to a parking spot to wait.  You don't make a dude wait thirteen minutes for one freakin' Cherry-Limeade.  That's Basic Drive-Thru 101.  If you can't get that simple thing together, your business is screwed.

I finally get to the window and the dude at the window says, \"You had three shakes, right?\"

I said no. \"A large Cherry-Limeade.\"

He turns to another guy.  \"Can I get a large Cherry-Limeade, right away?\"

SERIOUSLY?  I wait thirteen freakin' minutes for a single friggin' drink and you don't even have it ready when I get there?  Oh, screw you, Sonic of Sun Prairie.  When your crappy restaurant goes belly-up, I will be there to dance in front of your For Sale sign.

This place has been open for MONTHS. There is no excuse for incompetence like this.  

I finally get my drink--more than 15 minutes after my initial order.  Fifteen minutes for one large drink, folks.  And they still charged me full-price.  And my Route 44 upsell was completely forgotten.

If the owner of that Sonic ever reads Yelp:  Hey, dude--sell out to someone who knows what the they are doing.  Running a fast-food restaurant isn't hard. I know--I did it for three years, successfully, mind you.  Your employees are lost. Your food is lacking. And sitting in a drive-thru for fifteen minutes is unforgivable.  Even Culver's will burn people through in less than ten minutes.

Go away, Sonic.  You're bad at your job."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I leave here happy every time!!! Love bringing my little sister here to get lunch because they are so fast even during the busy times of day...usually lunch  and when the high school gets out. The employees are beyond friendly and willing to help me with whatever it is! One employee even helped me carry my order to my car because I didn't have enough hands! They go above and beyond the expectations of \"good\" customer service!!"}
{"text":"Nothing like ordering a nutter butter cookie jar shake to find out it's only a vanilla. 
1 star for effort, I suppose."}
{"text":"Just pulled in ready to order when and employee was taking out the trash. He went to the dumpster lifted the lid and threw the trash inside. Wheeled the trash can inside the door and stood there pulling trash bags off the roll while chatting with co workers. We observed a solid 5 minutes before we pulled away not willing to risk him not washing his hands while handling our food. Perhaps he needs a refresher in food handling? We won't be back."}
{"text":"Every time I get food here my order is never correct even when Its repeated back to me... find another sonic"}
{"text":"Sonic has a place in the world and they have a unique niche that none of the other fast food places really inhabit. You can park your car and order without having to move. This is insanely handy for the parent with a bunch of kids or the commuter who just doesn't feel like getting out or the lazy bastard (Not me. No, really. I'm not lazy!) who doesn't want to get out of a car that is loaded with stuff just pulled from the storage unit.

Pull up to a slot, figure out what you want, press the button and order. Heck, you can even pay the sign directly with your credit or debit card!

After a bit, a carhop brings your food right to your window. Sometimes, they're even wearing roller skates. I mean, how cool is that!

Burgers are solid and have the usual fixings. They also do hot dogs (\"coneys\") with an assortment of toppings. Today I went with the \"Bacon and Blue\" which was yummy but probably not a great idea. Lots of loose bits that kept falling out of the sandwich and into my lap. Or into the seat of the car. Especially the poppy seeds. So next time I'll have something else. But it was sure yummy!

Note: This Sonic location also has covered tables and a dining room if you'd prefer to get out of your car."}
{"text":"They always get me in and out very quickly in the drive through here. I stick with mozzarella sticks, they are always cooked fresh and are absolutely DELICIOUS. The girl that's usually at the window (at least mid afternoon) is super nice and very pleasant to talk to in the rare event it takes a while. Everyone here, though, is wonderful. I have no complaints about this location."}
{"text":"food is decent, but tots are often cold. music is so loud that they cannot hear to take your order. turn the music volume down."}
{"text":"They take their time here huh? I'm still waiting. Still. Are they cereal? I'm still waiting."}
{"text":"Sonic Drive-In Sonic Drive-In of Glendale, AZ 4132 I've never been so disgusted in my life. This is my SON'S meal that we just received from your \"restaurant.\" Call me crazy, but it looks like you're attempting to charge me $30 for something I might find in the dumpster. The bun has MOLD on it!! I'm so thankful I checked the order at home before giving it to my kid - since I ALWAYS order a hamburger for him and your employees ALWAYS seem to think a cheeseburger is the same thing (which did actually happen again, I removed the cheese before flipping it over to discover this). Additionally, these chili cheese tots look like they've been fingered and half eaten, and lack both mustard and onions which my receipt clearly states. Not that Im going to allow my family to eat this sorry excuse for overly-priced \"food\" - I've definitely lost my appetite. So thanks for that. Tried calling the manager on duty... got hung up on twice. So much for a refund I guess? Or looking into what I consider a serious matter?... The fact that there is no quality food check at your establishment to attempt to feed my children something I wouldn't give my dogs is dangerously gross."}
{"text":"I got my Sonic fix, so there is a couple stars for ya.

Sadly our fries were VERY undercooked, I didn't get any mustard with my plain hot dog, and we didn't get any napkins.

These are fast food basics, people."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE Sonic lover. Saddly, this is the closest to my house and MY LEAST FAVORITE SONIC!!! The service is very slow and 4/5 times the grilled cheese I order is under cooked and soggy. If I have the craving for some Sonic I try to avoid this one unless it's their happy hour and I am going strictly for a Limeaide.

One bonus to this location is they do recognize me and my coworkers... so if the drive thru is packed we park in a stall and every now and then we get food brought to us first. They have TOTALLY forgotten about us as well.... so I guess it's pretty hit and miss here."}
{"text":"Cheap eats AND good service?!! At a drive-in? While I do LOVE me an Oreo sonic blast (with chocolate syrup, so I can make-believe it is chocolate ice cream), I do acknowledge that its just cheap chemical laden soft serve mixed with Oreo. But for some reason I am loyal. \"why?\" I ask myself. It always comes down to the service. Incredibly quick service with a relatively cheerful attitude. That's all we ask of a fast food chain. And this location delivers everytime. Exceptional service always places a nice set of beer goggles on mediocre fare. Solid American food with a smile. A rare case in which you get more than what you pay for."}
{"text":"So I have to say I love Sonic's frozen delicacies. It is a treat for me to come here and pick up goodies for my little ones. I get a cookie dough master blast and two mini vanilla shakes for my kids. When I ordered in the drive thru, the lady who I have ordered from before was so noteworthy unpleasant. Very unhappy and unfriendly. When this happened before, it made a happy experience getting Sonic's famous frozen treats a very diapleasing one. Everyone has a bad day but I was absolutely appalled. I noticed another reviewer wrote about the same girl only a few hours before me. 1/25 4:30p. Maybe management will notice this, I don't know. I just think that it is  unfortunate that some customers may not choose to stop here to enjoy their favorite treats because of this. This would have been a five because I love their food but that is where it ends."}
{"text":"Horrible costumer service. Never gets the order gets the order right. Never apologetic seems like manager is very defensive and angry"}
{"text":"Came over with my 2year old it took 20 minutes to place my order and one hour to get it! This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to in 57 years!! Unreal!!! Embarrassing if I were the owner!! Hope I don't get sick!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the service that we recieved not the meal that was presented.

So, I am from California and my family and I were in AZ for vacation to see my wife's old friend. I convinced her we should go to sonic because there are not a lot in California.

We get there and I park in my spot to order after completeing the order the guy on the speaker tells me that the card machine is broken and that if I wanted to pay with card I would need to go into the establishment in pay (I would of paid with cash, but all I had at the time was card) I get out of the car go up to place and open the door step inside and out of nowhere a manager named David comes out of nowhere and starts questioning me, as I amI trying to explain I don't even get two words out because he keeps asking me what I am doing in there, while talking over me. One of the workers was trying to get attention I believe the guy who took my order. He tells me to step outside because he wants to talk to me, I explain to him what the person on the Speaker told me and he told me that is not true and I should know better, even though I told him right before this that this was our first time at sonic. At this point I am thinking that this guy has a huge ego problem. He starts to yell at me (enough for people sitting at the tables to turn around and watch the whole incident happen). He basically believes that I was trying to rob the store.... yeah at 5pm on a saturday night. Needless to say I got back in the car no food in hand and drove off."}
{"text":"Not very impressed check all your food before you leave because there's almost a guarantee that there's something wrong. If you try to call and tell the... Busy signal for several hours no answer. It's not worth it"}
{"text":"Slushie and shake machines are always broken...
3rd time here and they still don't work..."}
{"text":"LET IT BE KNOWN: 4 STARS FOR THE DRINKS, NOT THE FOOD.

The burgers, chicken bites, were all pretty generic. I drove here with some friends and one even got food poisoning, though I told him not to get a breakfast burrito at 5pm! This is not Jack in the Box! Anyway, the food Sonics has serves only to have something to munch on while you partake in some of the most glorious non-alcoholic liquids ever created.

2p-5p is happy hour and half off all drinks. Me and my friends missed it but whatever. I grabbed a cranberry limeade slush with orange flavoring and it was just the bees knees. I drove all the way to LA with that drink and was almost sad when I had to throw the cup away.

Sonics drinks are just so damn good, and are made in so many combinations (on top of being customizable), that despite the barely tolerable food, I can still give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty standard. The menus are printed so small that it makes ordering difficult. The food came out hoy and pretty good. The chili dogs were lacking in chili. The new boneless buffalo wings were pretty good for fast food. All in all, average fast food."}
{"text":"If your planning on going to this location...DON'T!!!
Everything I order was disgusting. Chicken strips hard and cold, forgot to put sauces I asked for in the bag, and burger looked like a 5 year old created it. The only thing good at this or any sonic is there drinks, which they do manage to screw those up also. Beware of sonic, there going down the drain!"}
{"text":"I sure love their corn-dogs! Also ordered the Chicago dog, which was delicious! Service was speedy fast and very efficient. 
Nice day to sit outside on their patio."}
{"text":"Always what you expect out of Sonic with the 50's style drive up service. Fast, medium price, and above decent food for fast food. Like switching a bun for Texas toast and the huge selection of soda flavors. One little note
 to owners: it's impossible to order for kids and passengers! We had to get out to see the menu board and I doubt we'd do that on a cold day.

And our server was polite, fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We stopped by a couple of days ago to grab a slushie. I love the fact that there is a regular drive thru on top of their unique pull in and stop menu stalls, makes things a lot quicker if you don't have the time for the regular experience. Luckily, there was no one else in the drive thru line so our order came out pretty fast. We ended up getting a chicken asiago sandwich combo for $4, not bad. We got the watermelon slushie as the drink and tater tots as the side. OMG the tater tots are so good! They have the perfect amount of seasoning and crunch, essential characteristics of tater tots. I think these are the best tater tots I've had actually. The sandwich was filling and the slushie was refreshing. 

We will be back again for happy hour!"}
{"text":"We went there for birthday desserts and found out they no longer sell banana splits nor anything with pineapple and no dipped cones. So we settled for these brick thick shakes that even after being stirred u still cant get it thru the straw nor taste the flavor fully of the shake u ordered. Straight slacking. DQ on 27ave n camelback you have our business completely now & no more sonics 51ave n mcdowell..
total disappointment. Totally killed the moment."}
{"text":"Everything was right and they were friendly.  I'd go back.  Love their cherry limeaides."}
{"text":"I was not too happy with the service.  There was a long wait after ordering through the drive thru; the customer in front of me actually drove out of it and left their order.  When I got to the window, I was asked if I wanted I cup holder for my 5 drinks, but then told \"but we are out of the ones that hold 4, we only have the ones that hold 2 drinks.\"  That would not be much help for 5 drinks.  I had to ask for condiments because they were not offered.  We ordered a total of 5 meals, all with fries or tots; upon asking for ketchup, the cashier asked me if 3 would be enough.  How would 3 packets of ketchup be enough for all of the orders?  An even worse disappointment was getting home and and finding out that I was an order of fries."}
{"text":"SLowest sonic I have ever been to and half the time the food is either cold or burnt or looks Gross. Grey hot dogs?!?"}
{"text":"Low quality food all right place for a quick drink on the road. I've tried the coconut cream pie shake"}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  They mess up our order pretty much every time we go.  Shake no whip cream please, nope still got whip cream.  No onion please, yep u get onion.  Fries are always cold and soggy.  Have to repeat order like 3 times every time.   Horrible!!"}
{"text":"for years I watched sonic commercials willing to pay $50 for a burger and a slush..finally the day came..and I paid around $11 for a breakfast sandwich..fries..a burger and a 44oz slush..was it as good as the commercials depict it to be? No but hey either are big macs..the burgers were better than most fast food chains though..and the slush did live up to the hype though and gave me the biggest brain freeze of my life!! Will be going again because hey nothing beats a hangover better than sonics!!"}
{"text":"I love Sonic.  I grew up eating frito pies and cherry limeades.  Now, I'm addicted to the Java Chillers.  BUT my enjoyment of Sonic has taken a huge hit lately.  The reason is the slow, unprofessional, unfriendly service that seems to be the norm at this location.  This Sonic is very close to my house, so I have tried multiple times to give them the benefit of doubt - maybe they are understaffed and that's why it takes so long to get orders out? (No, there are always kids running every which way when I get to the window)  Maybe the person was having a bad day? (No, I have yet, after probably 20 visits, to receive a \"Thank you\" from ANYONE)  This place is just managed terribly.  It's too bad that this one store can ruin such a great experience for so many people.  Get it together, Williams Field!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Sonic in the valley! Slow, rude, and can't even get a simple burger order correct."}
{"text":"A group of 5 of us went there tonight at 8pm parked and walked up to the window for some slushes. 
Well 42 minutes later we got are drinks and that's all we ordered. As we waited for are drinks we sat there and just watched cars in the drive-through come and go. 
The girl that took are orders we could hardly understand and come to find out she charged us for drinks we didn't even order and gave us the wrong size drinks. As if that's not bad enough we all got are drink and they SUCKED the cherry drink had this slimy red stuff in it as did the strawberry drink. We will NEVER go back there again and hope they get their act together"}
{"text":"Horrible, my family and I are at the hospital in Monroe for Easter and decided to go grab something to eat, I pulled up to the car hop intercom and ordered 2 hamburgers and 1 bacon cheese burger combos. I received the coldest fries, onion rings was hot but tasted like doe, my hamburger had an onion peel in it, and all burgers were dressed so sloppy!!! I know things happen at fast food restaurants, but I will never eat here again in my life, the worst presentation and food ever! And yes I am a tad harsh because I was so hungry, and it still was inedible... Ugh"}
{"text":"I like the new slush flavors mixed with vodka!

Service is always good, and I just discovered the drive-thru...odd, I know, but I just figured a place where you drive up, park, order from your car and the staff brings your food, why would you have a drive-thru?

So, I tried it! You drive up, order from your car, park, and the staff brings your food to you...hmmm.

I'll keep coming back for the Lemonberry slush, anyway."}
{"text":"Not the kind of place anyone should be eating at, let alone use the locked restrooms, but maybe that's why they're locked...put a lock on the front door while you're at it!

They spend a lot of money on those stupid ads, they really need to divert some of those marketing dollars on their management and train the staff better, and learn how to:

1) order fresh buns
2) cook burgers to the correct temperature to avoid pink meat.
3) stock a variety of stemware, some people still use knives.
4) clean restrooms, Period!
5) wipe tables, OFTEN, and not just with a towel.
6) repair broken phones, or remove from tables.
7) speak slowly and clearly, for we're not used to speaking through a phone to order food.

The concept of ordering from your car is kinda cool, but that is now being eliminated in some locations (like this one) and you now can eat inside, but then you still need to order via a communication device, but it's like you're in jail and asking your mother to bring you a chili dog...weird (see #7)

Do they ever disenfectent those phones? Just plain weird, and scary to even think about."}
{"text":"Every once and a while I really want a diet cherry limeade. This type of drink is soooo not good for you. But I love carbonated diet sodas. I don't drink them anymore, but when I want something limey and over the top with a cherry I go here. The drive through is open 24 hours. Never really get the food. but i love the drinks! My bf gets the Ocean water. Its hella blue. Makes your poop blue.
They have little sundaes that are cute, kid sized. the strawberry is the best!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but they often neglect to include part of our order.  Last time we came here we ordered 8 corn dogs and only got 7.  This time we ordered 4 orders of chicken wings and only got 3.  I am beginning to wonder if this is their way of cutting costs.  NOT COOL!  I will be checking my order before leaving from now on, with apologies to the person behind me."}
{"text":"This review is based on the fact that it's in Vegas.  My group wanted to go here for lunch.  They wanted a light lunch before the buffet we were planning to have later that day.  So Sonics was agreed upon (with them.)

I was hesitant to go to a Sonics when we were at Vegas.  We could get this anywhere, anytime, so why now?  But I agreed, we needed a light lunch and why not have it cheap while at it.

Unfortunately, it wasn't too cheap.  You can't just get one of their $1 burgers cuz they're tiny and you'll still be starving afterwards.  So I got the large chili cheese fries to split also.

The burgers... sucked.  Even for a dollar, they sucked.  Badly.  The chili cheese fries... WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY overly salty.  Like, I was tempted to drench it in ketchup to dilute the salt.  Horrible.  Don't go to Vegas for fast food, if you do, don't go here.  There's an In N Out a few miles away..."}
{"text":"Cleanliness: 2 Stars
Hopefully the rest of the restaurant isn't like the  front, this place looks run down and unkept. The concrete is completely filthy and the tables have food debris stuck to them.. Gross 

Hospitality: 4 stars
The staff was smiling and greeted me with a welcome. Friendly and repeating of my order to insure accuracy. 

Food: 4 Stars
Our order was complete, and accurate. Each item was hot and fresh. However, some times were kept warm instead of made to order. 

Overall:
This place is great for a drive thru only, as I wouldn't recommend dining on the patio."}
{"text":"What the hell happened to sonic fries seriously!? I remember when I used to come just for the fries now this fries are just awful  the young lady bringing us food too looks as misrable as the fries here we ask for barbque sauce you would have thought she was getting tortured Geez!!"}
{"text":"No stars, but Yelp made me, horrible service!! We waited 45 mins for shakes..shakes!!! On a Tuesday night, with only 4 other cars. Then the manager apologizes and gives us chips for 4 free limeades on our next visit? Really?? I don't think I want to wait on limeades in the future..thanks but no thanks! Server did a great job though!"}
{"text":"Reviewing backed on other sonic experiences - we've always come here for the shakes! 1/2 off between 8pm and midnight! 

You get a whole lot of Shake!!! I really like that it's open 24hours (at least the drive through is). Very convenient for late night cravings and normal sonic prices since it's not right on the strip."}
{"text":"One of the better sonics in the valley. My wife and I hit happy hour when ever we can. 

Dirty Dr. Pepper, mozzarella sticks and a chicken griller are my most ordered. 

My wife and I go for shakes a lot. The coconut cream pie shake left me happy. 

Service is adequate and servers have always skated out to me."}
{"text":"I am only giving it 1 star cause it's making me!! I ordered Iced Tea and they charge you for the lemon ..., I've never heard of such a thing and my daily runs to Sonic are no longer!!"}
{"text":"Really friendly and great food as always. However, they need a new speaker system in drive through because I always have to drive to window to order."}
{"text":"This sonic is always slow but I finally decide to rave the line and wait in the drive through for 15-20 mins only to find out the shake machine is broken and no shakes can be made.  Worst part about this is their drive thru line has no exit except all the way through so I get to sit her for another 20 mins writing this review and thinking about how I will never go to this sonic again"}
{"text":"Uhm how does a burger joint run out of burger buns!?!?!?!  Not cool at all I was so craving a sonic burger I hope someone is disciplined for not ordering plenty of buns"}
{"text":"Can for a cherry limeade, blue raspberry slushy, banana cream pie shake and a Oreo chocolate shake. Oh yeah. It's going down! And it's happy hour for another 5 mins."}
{"text":"Super disappointed - I ordered a cherry limeade and instead got a Shirley temple. They could have easily told me they were out of limeade but instead, after paying $3, they gave me some cherry flavored sprite. I had the limeade last week so I know what it's supposed to look and taste like. Will not be going back to this location!"}
{"text":"I have come to expect my order to be wrong here every time.  I think this is a systemic problem when you have a restaurant ran by 16 year old kids."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few time and so far I haven't been disappointed. There is one cashier that's always really friendly and gave our dogs a free \"treat\" some fries haha. The food is always great and they make the deserts like nobody's business. Try their caramel sundae from there (wow). Customer service is great, fast drive thru and food is great, what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Everything here is cheap and nasty.  The corn dogs and chili dogs taste like rubber, and most restaurant with kids running the place suck"}
{"text":"We go to the Sonic some Fridays for a cheap after the school week treat.  They are quick and the drinks are good... but they often get our order wrong and I only ever order 3 drinks total  It's no big deal, but I always order the same thing (lemon slushies so the color doesn't make a huge stain if spilled) and it's a bummer to often end up with lemon berry slushies.  So, make sure your order is right when you place it!  Sometimes I do that and still end up with the wrong ones!"}
{"text":"Really can't go wrong with sonic for a treats and slushies. I really don't care for the food here beside the tots or fries if you tell them you want it freshly made. half price shakes after 8 pm."}
{"text":"Wow! The order taker was awesome and the delivery girl was very nice.  And the food was perfect.  Tots and cherry limeades!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously?! Such a disappointment. I remember having sonics when i was a kid and not liking it very much. But from always seeing commercials i would think maybe i was wrong and i need to give it another chance one day.. Well, another chance was given while i was in vegas and my gosh i was right all along!! we went late at night and there were boppers hangin out outside being rowdy and noisy and all over the place so that just made it worse. We ordered from speakers that would keep screeeeechinggg and making loud ugly noises. The food was totally just BLAH. I dont even remember what anyone ordered.. I even forgot we went there until i saw pictures from my friends camera, I guess it was not memorable enough that i totally forgot we even went there.. After eating sonics, we all felt like crap... =(

I think the best thing I had there was the cherry limeade drink. No joke.. *sigh*"}
{"text":"Stressed and having a bad day in general this Sonic was like a neon sign flashing.  Comfort food!  Ice Cream!  Drive Through!

15 minutes later I've finished off that heavenly soft and buttery grilled cheese sandwich and I'm taking a sip of their new Banana pudding shake. (The Chocolate Peanut Butter had been planned, but this was even better.)  Yea, yea. It's not healthy.  It's not even close to healthy (unless I was seriously dairy deficient).  But ya know what?  On a day today that stinking Lean Cuisine wasn't going to do it.  

The dude at the window didn't even make eye contact. He gets 2 stars.  But the girls on skates seemed fairly happy even though it was already getting pretty warm.  

As a general rule, their burgers are pretty good - but their Coney's are the best.  It's trash food, but it's a level of \"comfort\" trash food that you're just not going to get at Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"I would love to point out that the employee, Nick, has amazing customer service and is excellent at his job. He knows exactly what he is doing and should definitely be a manger if he's not one already. I would also like to say other employees should learn from Nick! Especially a blonde girl named \"Kim\". She has no idea what she's doing. Terrible customer service and very rude. She looked at me and stared like if I was stupid until I had to say something. Nick had to constantly come up and help me because all she could say was \"no\".  A manager should definitely talk to her or fire her cause I've never seen such a terrible worker like her!!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 extreme Totts and received 2 chili cheese Totts. This is the 2nd time this has happened to us. It just seems like the workers are lazy. I don't recommend this sonics at all. I live close by and they seem to not have it together."}
{"text":"I go frequently because every day, from 2-4pm, 44 oz. strawberry limeades are on \"happy hour\". But more importantly, chunks of more or less real strawberries come up the straw into your mouth. There are also real limes down in your gargantuan tankard of ice crunch and sweet sweet nectar. For a dollar. 

Sometimes I get something big and fried at Sonic and it makes me feel a little gross, but on the whole their food is great if you can handle its intensity of flavor. I should note that I have a very fond memory of eating bacon cheeseburgers (and the aforementioned strawberry limeades) there after a hard day's work, but that could have been the heat and poverty of the Tennessee county in which I was day laboring, or my avid youth, or the sheer novelty of my new southern surroundings. I do stick more to drinks and desserts if I go here though.

Total Americana - there's a lot of junk to pick through, but you can make your personal choice for something special. I chose limeade."}
{"text":"I usually love sonic! I'm a sucker for their stuff but my poor mother just felt so embarrassed by one of their staff members. I understand that my mother does not speak perfect English, and does struggle with certain words, but while trying to order the staff member apparently decided not to even bother at making an attempt to understand her and instead ignored her and moved on to the next person. She was left talking to herself, very confused and she could hear the staff member taking the persons order in the car next to her. She sat there waiting until someone noticed and came to her car to take her order. She felt very embarrassed and I am furious that someone would be so insensitive towards her when she is making an effort."}
{"text":"I dont know how many days its been since I've placed my order.   Its been at least two moons since i ran out of gas in line.   Tell my wife i love her... we were all brave.  So...so brave."}
{"text":"I have tried to be fair, waiting over a year to post the experiences of 4 separate visits. During the first 3 visits, the response to my order was the same: \"We don't have that today.\" Different order each time - same response each time. Today, I waited 4-5 minutes at the drive-through before my order was taken on an intercom system that delivers every 3rd to 4th word. Then, I waited in a line of cars for 15 minutes, watching the adolescent employees talking inside. No adult employee/manager was ever visible. When the teen employee brought my beverage, her first words were: \"I'm surprised you didn't leave.\" I give up. Sonic: Please do your brand and Gastonia a favor - close this location."}
{"text":"I eat here quite a bit. #7, Coney dog and tots. It is cheap ($6.69) and serves its purpose. Is fast, the car hops are generally pretty nice all the time, and no one bothers me while I'm eating.

Always get a route 44 cherry slushy for the road ;)"}
{"text":"Across the street from Palms Place was a Sonic. I have NEVER visited one. I always ask my friends \" Where the hell are they?\" 

\" Gilroy.\"

Who goes to Gilroy?? 

So anyway-I was a bit blown out with the whole setup. Fools ordered, dude on roller skates brought the food super quickly. Eventually I needed to step up and make a decision. 

And there it was  ....on the menu .....with a big picture...\" Free Tots with Cheeseburger purchase.\" 

Oh sheee-it. 

Made my decision, and even rocked the whole \" Hook it up with Cheese and Chili on my tots.. I'll pay the difference.\" 

I'm straight. 

I looked at the little price window and scanned my Debit. It had been touched many times. You could see no numbers, only squares. 

Not long after I recevied my burg. It was sorta like Wendy's but bigger. I kinda loved it. The tots were good. 

Afterwards I had a stomach ache while swimming it off in the pool. That Sonic food just sits in ya. 

But I'd go back, just not often."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE HISTORY OF EVER.  I stopped in for breakfast today and an iced tea and the person, at the drive thru speaker was so rude, I stopped for a minute to make sure it wasn't communication error.  I ended up so frustrated at repeating myself to the rude female on the other end that I just pulled away.  Rare that I would have such an awful experience that I would go post something about it but today was certainly an exception.  I won't be back to this Sonic.  Ever."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE TOTS and the CHERRY LIMEADE!!! But that's about it. If I want a hamburger, I'd go somewhere else. If I want a dessert, I'd still go somewhere else. However, if I want TOTS or CHERRY LIMEADE, Sonic's the spot and it's pretty cool that the drive-in is open 24 hours. 

Because of the commercials running nationwide, but locations are not, you got to try it for yourself. I like it enough not to scare people away."}
{"text":"This place always has a ton of teenagers hanging around making a lot of noise. The food is really greasy but not to bad tasting I guess. The service is bad. We went there 3 times in a row and only got ice cream, had to wait a half hour. First time they gave us a token for a free drink second time they came out after 20 minutes, we were one of about 3 cars there and they asked us what we ordered because they lost the slip, the third time, we waited over half hour and finally just left, have not and will not go back again."}
{"text":"Not the best food for you, but tastes so dang good for the price!  This is a hot spot for my boyfriend and I because we love the tots at this location.  Everytime we get it here, it is always crispy and have the right amount of salt to add that right flavor.  Who knew someone could be so crazy for tots.  I bet even Napoleon Dynamite would sneak these into his pockets!

Other items I like are:
Mozzarella sticks (be careful when you bite into them as they are very hot inside) with mariana sauce
Strawberry Limeade slush
Super Sonic Breakfast Burrito (ask for their salsa packets to go with it)
Any of their shakes are great as they have great ice cream (my favorites are banana cream pie, strawberry banana, oreo blast)

My boyfriend likes to eat their burgers and chicken strip sandwich.  

As for dates, I think this is great place to go during the winter or when there is cooler weather because there is no indoor place to sit down.  If you just want to pick up food quickly, they have a drive in.  Otherwise, it's nice to sit in your car, listen to your own music, and have people bring food to your car.   Sometimes it ends up being a sweet mini-date with your friends, family, or significant others.  My favorite thing to do  with my boyfriend is listen to old time songs, like michael jackson, and just rock out in the car while we eat our food :)"}
{"text":"Drive in ! No inside dinning! Great for kids! Cheap food for the masses. Who doesn't like an old style DriveIn. Crazy to pay for ice cream and sit in the car with my heat on... Lol! Eat it...love it...Yelp it!"}
{"text":"Never.  Never ever.  Never ever, ever, ever will I ever ever ever go back to this or any other Sonic.  Why, you ask?  Food that went all the way past putrid and was bordering, if not crossing the line, of actual garbage being served under the guise of food.  Tater tots that were hotter then hell sitting on my lap, yet still somehow frozen in the middle.  Had to take out the garbage directly to the outside, I mean, this was some seriously bad food.  

You may want to put your taste buds at risk, but no.  No place rots like Sonic."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this location. The employees have no idea what SUGAR FREE means. I by no means can have sugar and wanted to have a nice time out with my children and enjoy a sugar free drink. Upon looking at the menu, I noticed they have \"Splenda\" options. I emphasized my request for a sugar free drink and they could not comprehend. I could not enjoy my experience due to the level of stress I obtained trying to order a sugar free drink! This is the closest sonic to my house, but I swear I will never come here again. I will travel across town before I visit this SHITTY location with SHITTY service!"}
{"text":"The foot long Coney hotdog was great the first time i had it, so i had to order it again. This time with some boneless buffalo wings (:  i absolutely love sonic it was just weird that this time, my friend and i weren't able to do separate transactions when we were able to a couple weeks ago.

Update: Just got home and took a bite out of my Coney dog and to my disappointment the onions i asked for weren't there. I'm still leaving the 4 stars though because the food is still really great. Just wish my onions were there. Oh well."}
{"text":"when i'm craving fast food, this is the place! i love sonics! the grilled cheese is even good! the breakfast sandwiches are soo yummy! soo much to choose from their menu! the prices are great tooo... i love how its always open too, i think 24hrs...right?"}
{"text":"Not good but not to bad. 

This location was a stones throw from my hotel room at Palms Place so I came here to get burgers 3 times. 

They have a bunch of crackheads working here but they're open 24/7 and they have this happy hour that runs from early afternoon to early evening where burgers and such are 1/2 off. 

You can get like 5 big ass Sonic burgers for about 12 bucks during happy hour. 

Fries are decent and the drive thru service was quick 2 outta 3 times. 

Even though the staff is high they didn't screw up my no tomatoes no lettuce plans at all. 

If your staying at Palms Place it's right across the street and for the 50 bucks it would cost you to get full on room service, you can stumble across the street and with a 50 dollar bill you could get enough food to serve your floor."}
{"text":"I give this sonic drive in a 5 stars because every time I come in the staff is always super friendly and always ask how my day is going. I usually order a deluxe chicken sandwich which is normally about a 6 minute wait which I have no problem waiting because I know I'll be getting it nice and fresh! Defiantly plan on continuing to come back to this sonic!"}
{"text":"The only real reason that I keep coming here is because its very convenient, I'm only five minutes away. I try to keep my order short because your average wait is about 35-45mins. I've noticed though, that no matter what you order it always seems to take too long. I've ordered a full meal or two and I've made orders with just one drink and they still manage to take long! I've tried going during different times, different days and its always the same thing. They have gotten my order wrong a few times and half of the time the food is cold. So I only really go when I have no other options or if I want a drink/milkshake because they are half priced. Other than that I wouldn't be going back..
Oh and definitely avoid Thursdays after 9ish. Their parking lot gets full of motorcyclists, they take up the whole place and more than half of them don't buy anything, they just hang there."}
{"text":"Horrible service here. We ordered 3 tater tots and one corn dog. Took almost 15 minutes.  There was only 3 other cars. Was better off getting McDonald's."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm yummy as I write this review I am thinking of the tasty, creamy, cold, banana shake just swirling around in my mouth!

My hubby made a quick stop to Sonic one day after work and picked us up milkshakes as we had a sweet tooth. We usually get a hot fudge chocolate shake or malt however this time I was in the mood to try banana.

Wow this was a banana shake to remember and experience again as it had sliced chunks of fresh banana in it! Unable to drink my shake with a straw, every spoonful was a slice of yummy real banana! Now that is a shake that I really enjoyed and is nice to have fresh fruit chunks in a shake rather than just a flavoring.

Sonic you never let us down, keep up the great quality fast food on the go and we will keep coming over and over!"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with sonic? They have such a vast variety of menu options that you can choose from so you never get bored. I usually make a stop when I am craving their cheddar peppers, onion rings or a dessert such as a milkshake or lava cake sundae. I don't visit often for dietary reasons however is a cheat spot that I can enjoy every once and awhile . Their service is fast and friendly for a fast food joint."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here and never had a desire to.  My wife insisted, so she won.  The food wasn't anything special, but the customer service was top notch.  And in my book customer service us 80% of the experience.  Plus, my kids dig it too.  Next time my wife suggests it as a fast food option, I won't complain too much."}
{"text":"I always come here for late night drinks. They have many options to choose from and if you go after 8pm it's half off shakes and slushes! If you are in need for cheap large drinks and don't want to go to a gas station then sonic is the way to go. I only give it 3 stars because of how long it takes sometimes to get our order and the drive thru can get a little crazy. 
They also have really good hot dogs"}
{"text":"If you go, be sure to check your order for accuracy. The staff here do not seem to be familiar with the menu or how to count money.
I paid 11.60 for 2 half price shakes after 8pm. Upon arrival no answer at the car hop so myself and other cars resorted to the drive through. I had to get out of my car and speak into the drive through speakers because they could not hear. I paid for my order. Two shakes a half-price cheeseburger and a regular price double bacon cheeseburger. Checked it before I left and it was wrong. I parked AGAIN and requested it be corrected. After waiting an additional 17 minutes for a response requested a refund for the double bacon cheeseburger they got wrong on the order. MANAGER brings me $2.05 for a $5.99 regular price burger. Wow."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is a franchise store or company owned, but the leadership there (team lead or manager on duty) was not at all friendly, was not well educated on procedures, and did not resolve my concern.

First, the Sonic ad today said All Hot Dogs $1 today only.  It displayed 2 hot dogs, but did not state that it was ONLY those 2 hot dog varieties except in the minuscule fine print.  Very misleading Sonic.

Secondly, when I went through the drive thru, although this location is a pay by phone enabled, the pay ID number does not get printed on the receipt in the drive thru (which it should be for paying by phone), and this was not clear.  

So, I showed my pay by phone gift card complete number to the lead or manager on duty, a young dark complexion girl and she was bewildered when I pointed her to the gift card full number and asked that she punch it in at the register to complete the payment.  I know this is possible because sometimes the magnetic strip does not work and they have to enter the gift card number manually.  She was so confused and was not understanding what I was communicating in very simple terms.

Since I did not have enough cash to pay for the meal, especially since one of the hot dogs I chose was $2 instead of $1, I was not able to purchase the meal.  So I left empty handed.

Note that the waitress girl that brought my food out was very friendly and did all she could.  But the lead or manager girl was unfriendly, lacked sufficient knowledge about gift cards and payment methods, and did not resolve my concern/issue in any way whatsoever.

Hopefully attrition occurs and new leadership replaces her, or she gets additional training very soon.

And, I hope that Sonic will be more clear in their advertising when \"specials\" indicating \"All Hot Dogs\" doesn't mean all varieties of hot dogs.  Very misleading."}
{"text":"Sonic is always something exciting for me whenever traveling because it is like that rare, endangered species of bird that you do not see in your own homeland. You have found it's feather before, but you cannot recall the last time you actually saw one.

Well this time, we were DETERMINED to track this rare beast down ... and track we did! 

Once we caught it, the result was mixed to say the least. It was good! ... just not great.

But that didn't matter. It was the allure of finding this gem of a lunch stop with it's beautful plumes of cherry limeades, ocean water and chicago dogs that did matter. It was the excitement of ordering through a little intercom then, voila!, food appears! It was that, that made this experience worth having."}
{"text":"This place has become a joke over the last year. It was a good location but now is pathetic. The workers don't care, every one of my last 5 orders, as of tonight, have been wrong. The management must be seriously lacking now, no more chances. Never going back to this place"}
{"text":"CHEAP EATS . . . great when out and about on a busy day

Was returning home from a vet visit with my adorable doggie and needed sustenance.  I never leave her in the car alone, so a drive-thru was the only option.  I'd just about settled on a small burger and fries from McDonalds, when I spotted Sonic.

The Junior Deluxe and fries were pretty flavorful for about $1 each, however, the small order of onion rings wasn't.  I'd never eaten rings that tasted like a dessert.  The third bite confirmed the presence of sugar.  Sugar?   Back into the bag for disposal.  Pulled out of the parking lot to head back home when I decided to return.  Sonic should know that they made a huge preparation mistake with that coating.   

No mistake.  Per the friendly manager who happened to be working the window, sugar is added to the breading.  ech.  Not the best result, in my opinion.  He quickly offered another side which I graciously declined.  What about a drink, he asked.  Well, okay, I answered, even though I wasn't really thirsty---and beverages have always been unwelcome car refreshments since a friend spilled a nearly full one into the between-the-seat ignition well of my new Saab.  (She was accustomed to having beverage holders in that area.)  I'd keep it closed and drink it when I got home.  But his recommendation sounded so good---a cherry-limeade---that at the first traffic light I just HAD to taste it.  Delicious!  Bright, sweet, intensely-flavored.

If you ever happen to be in Parma---near Snow and Broadview---I'd recommend trying this nostalgic \"drive-in\"-themed restaurant, that has quick window service as well as rollerskating carhops---and a cute patio, too, that I never noticed until leaving.  Don't know if it's dog-friendly, though.

A scarce, lesser-known, but welcome change-of-pace option, to add to the two ever-present giants."}
{"text":"I've been going to this sonic for over 10 years and it's slowly becoming worse. I'm glad there's a new one on 67th ave that has been great so far compared to this location. When I ask for extra sauce, I expect more than one tiny sauce for a LARGE combo. And when you say you're gonna charge me for extra, I expect to get the EXTRA sauce in my bag. I was charged for nothing."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVEEEEE Sonic! I'll choose this place over a fancy restaurant ANY DAY. My Ideal cheap date spot. The burgers are awesome and so cheap! its just a shame i have to bust a mission to find a Sonic since there are none around my home. Every time i visit, its such a treat! :]"}
{"text":"There's a middle aged woman that will always forget your sauce. Always. She'll take 15 minutes to get your order to you. And when you get your meal, it'll either be wrong or she'll forget something. And when you tell her she forgot sauces, she'll go get you a single thing of sauce. Worst customer service I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Late night grubbin' is the norm at this location so prepare. Sonic has launched the summertime slushees. 4 different flavors, Tigers Blood, Blue Hawaiian, Bahama Mama & the one I've been waiting for Pickle Juice Slush. I got the Large size in anticipation while salivating with the first taste. Took a huge drink my first thought in my opinion was tooo sweet, some like that but imagining pickle juice had me wanting more sour. So the beginning is refreshing sugary ice then the after taste was the pickle flavor. This was Definately foreplay for the real thing. Going to the store tomorrow getting Dill Pickles and making my own. I won't be back for more, even the other flavors. But those that like it real sweet check em out."}
{"text":"I am normally a huge fan of Sonic and this one was really disappointing. I got onion rings with my meal and they were really dark colored and chewy. I ordered an unsweetened Route 44 tea with Peach and it was way too sweet. My co worker had fries with his meal and they cold and dry. I've never had an experience like this at sonic."}
{"text":"This location just absolutely sucks! I don't know why I keep giving them chance after chance I'm done. Never get the order right and the quality of food that comes out of there sucks. When it's lunch rush hour the food should be fresh and hot not like it's been sitting there for hours. I'll never give this location my money again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went  to sonic today, and the girl had to ready our order 3 times in order to get it right and then once we got the food and went home I find this. Yes the food mainly the tator -tots were SOAKED in grease. And it soaked into my car floor. I understand that it was 4 pm and happy hour was ending so it was busy but that's not an excuse to put out shitty quality. Not that I'm expecting red lobster but this IS NOT WORTH THE PAY . Our meal was 16$. 16$ got me a soaked bag and food covered in grease because of course they put the tator-tots on the top of everything else. But it wasn't just the tots my burrito was extremely soaked in grease on one end. I'm so disappointed. At least have so dignity in the little quality put out #NOTIP"}
{"text":"I am a SONIC FAN, so let me preface my review with that.  How can you beat 1/2 price drinks from 2-4p every day?  And they have like a gajillion options to choose from.  This is an easy in/out location.  The service is consistently a-ok.  Fast food isn't my thing...so can't review their food, but I have heard their onion rings ROCK!"}
{"text":"Charged my card 12 DOLLARS for a $3.25 order. I ordered items off of the value menu. Reached out and was told there was nothing they could do. I was not given a receipt with the order so I was stuck losing out on money. DO NOT GO TO THIS SONIC. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Apparently, this particular restaurant has partnered with the Nevada state rehabilitation department to staff their facility with the mentally handicapped, and that's fine. But when you order frozen limeade and they hand you plain limeade instead, and then on your next visit order corn dogs and get chili dogs instead... well, obviously these people are not being properly supervised.


I'm all for providing work programs for the mentally handicapped. But I also expect to get what I pay for. Sonic can do a better job of supervising their - of that I am certain. Until they do though, I will avoid the Sonic Drive-In at 4260 West Flamingo, in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This last Friday went for slushies. To start ordering was comically ridiculous. The order was for 3 med slushies and 2 small but it took several minutes to get it ordered. Finally someone came out and took the order on what appeared to be a cell phone.  

The small real fruit strawberry slush has chunks of peanut and chocolate in it. Luckily I opted to taste it before handing it over to my son who has a life threatening peanut allergy. 

To their defense I did not mention a peanut allergy but they should not be using dirty tools or mixing tools in my opinion. Nonetheless I have learned my lesson. As a parent of a kid with a peanut allergy you cannot and should never trust some slightly supervised high school kid to always follow procedure you are just looking for trouble. 

What's more troublesome is the response when I asked them to come out to see the slushie and explain to them they have candy in one.. A fluffy hair husky guy grabbed the drink and from a little distance flung it in the trash and then proceeded to yell from the outside ( like they can really hear him) \"You have to clean the area and remake this drink!\"

Again dealing with juveniles.

I guess I'm not too upset. I will stop paying for over priced shaved ice and bought a blender and will make my own all summer. Problem fixed and my little guys avoided a trip to the hospital."}
{"text":"My wife went to the sonic on greenfield and brown about 7pm. Ordered mozzerella sticks. \"Sorry, were out\" Ok then ordered Jalapeno poppers \" Sorry, out of those too\"... Someone needs to order extra on the next truck. Ridiculous..."}
{"text":"Went there on a sunday morning and was met by a sonics employee yelling at all 20 of us for not using one machine at the drive in our at the patio. Obviously, we college students needed typo split the bill so why not order on 4 separate machines? I have never been yelled at at a drive thru EVER. We took our business elsewhere. Yay Steak N' Shake!!!"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I have visited this location in the morning. Every single time I want to order, the red button flashes and flashes, and no one ever comes to address me in an appropriate amount of time. This particular day (about 10 minutes ago), it appeared that it was only 2 workers, and it was 5 cars in the stalls waiting. They appeared to be walking around aimlessly, as if they didn't know they were at work. I knock on the door for someone to take our order - no acknowledgement. My fiancée and I ordered 2 toaster sandwiches and 2 large drinks. It was 7:40. They STILL hadn't brought the food at 7:54, so we just pulled off. I wanted to pay with my card to speed up things, and they didn't even show the order on the board to confirm my total. I will NEVER visit this slow ass Sonic, and stick to where I know I will get great service - the Sonic on E Chandler in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"When one wakes up with a hang over that rivals that of being hit by a Mack Truck, nothing beats driving over to Sonic Burger with your friends in the same car you passed out in the night before. 

Everything on their menu screams all american fast food greatness from their chili cheese tater tots to their foot long coney's to their famous limeades. And the best part? You can either go through the drive thru or opt to pull into one of their many stalls and eat in your car! 

Thank you Sonic for providing me with the basic nessecities of life on those never ending Saturday/Sunday mornings after a night of painting the town red."}
{"text":"The worst food place I have ever been to. 20 minutes waiting for a bag of ice.  It always seems like no one is working. I've sat in the drive-thru line (no one else is in line) for up to 10 minutes without anyone taking my order. Note to the owner...fire everyone. I can only imagine how much more money you would be making if the people who work there actually did work."}
{"text":"It's sonic, what do ya want?  Have a burger and a shake.
Maybe a ice cream treat.
It's certainly the best tasting fast food if it's type but it's fast food.
And the staff at this location are terrible, so double check your order even though it took too long to explain what you wanted to begin with."}
{"text":"One word: Tots! 

Well there's a few more words I'd like to say and that would be about Sonic. I've always driven by but never stopped in. Maybe it was the fact that I could park and eat my meal without having to drive off a bit to a spot.

We went for the summer of shakes, where they were half off! There were quite a selection of flavors and combinations. 

Since it's close to work, I will come back to experience more!"}
{"text":"i wish we had sonic in hawaii! i love this place! and this place is in my boyfriends sisters backyard of her old house! we always have to stop here everyday of our vacation in arizona! even if its \"cold\". cold to me because its always 80 degrees in hawaii! but the slush's are sooo cheap and gooood. Ooh i must stop talking because i'm having withdrawls. :("}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the slush drinks. I will get one of them at least twice a week. While I am not a big fan of the hotdogs, the burger and breakfast food is pretty good. I also always get the tots with my food over the traditional fries. I also never had to really wait for my food. They seem to be pretty fast with orders no matter what time of day or length of the lines. 

Tip: Always check for deals of the day. They have half price burgers and special price drinks during certain times of day/week. Some of the slush deals are amazing."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars since it's SO close to my home. I can do a drunk walk here and get my grub by walking inside and pushing the button phone.

This is the only sonic that I know that has a drive-THRU. They still come and bring the food out to your car once you park, but they don't have the covered parking chill and shut off your engine spots like all the others. Instead you can actually go into the building where there are phones at tables. A push of the button and you make your order. You can sit in or as I do, walk back to wherever you need to go.

I dock this place 1 star because they're only open until 11pm on the weekends. With all the \"now open late night\" commercials, I would expect them to be serving until at least 2pm. 

Again, for me this is just another place to get drunk food. French fries are meh, but their onion rings are awesome, as are their ice cream cones. My boyfriend enjoys eating their nasty grease filled burgers for his guilty pleasure.

I go every weekend. It's become tradition at this point."}
{"text":"So this place prolly has the worst speakers or the workers inside don't listen or can't hear!  They mess up food every time and when asked to bring extra ketchup as stated on the receipt and a big straw.. neither is accomplished. Asked for a mayo cheese burger and they apparently they thought I wanted easy mayo.. they gave me the other one for free and brought this one out... how hard is it to follow an order! Def not gonna eat this burger! I just don't understand how hard it is to listen!! Oh well.. guess I'll just go somewhere else.."}
{"text":"Drive thru for a chili dog and bottle of water.
Had to repeat my order 3 times.
Get to the window, snotty young female acts like she's doing me a favor!
This place is a management Disgrace.
Great location, right kind of food, prices a little high. Why are you not busy?
Hate to see a place fail, but this one deserves it."}
{"text":"Came here today at 6/29/15 around 6:05ish. The young man who took my order at parking space 17 and the young man Nick who delivered it were very nice and friendly. My order was perfect. They had excellent customer service and the people who filled the order did so in a timely manner."}
{"text":"The service at this particular Sonic blows.  I gave up on it a year ago for the same reason, but tried again tonight, and apparently nothing's changed.  How long does it take to make a milk shake?

^ my boyfriend apparently wrote this review on my account last night.  I agree with the sentiment.  

Sonic is just a disappointment.  Their commercials are super enticing, but the product is not.  And if they make you wait more than 5 minutes on an empty Thursday night at 10:30 for two mediocre milkshakes, it's just not worth waiting for or paying for."}
{"text":"I'm here trying to 'Pickle Slushie'.. Totally doesn't taste like anything flavored pickle, super disappointed."}
{"text":"Well tonight I gave sonic another chance and it took over 10 minutes  to get our order and out of that line. To find out that they messed up the order and I don't get an apology instead I get irritated teenage girl. Not sure I'll be visiting anytime soon. The great thing is I'll be a lot healthier if I stay away from this fast food joint. And a lot happier without the attitude."}
{"text":"Yeah. I have a weak spot for their drink (esp the ice they use), tots, corn dogs, wraps and range in the menu overall. It's nice to have more of an option than just a sandwich when you go to a fast food spot."}
{"text":"I would say I visit this location maybe once every month. sometimes for food, sometimes just for a drink and each time the service is OKAY. don't get me wrong they are not rude but sometimes they just aren't the most friendly in the customer service business. I totally get it but sometimes even my order is wrong & ive even received a \"Reese's blast with no Reese's in the actual ice cream only on the whip. like I said it's okay I get it. mistakes happen. but tonight I received EXCELLENT service from KYRA! from start to finish she was very friendly and upbeat. she got my order correct without going through multiple other things I didn't order because she couldn't hear me and was just a pleasant encounter. thank you kyra."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Sonic. The breakfast burrito rocks. I love their hot dog varieties - it's so hard to choose!!!  

I also love their ice cream. It's delicious and there is lots of variety. 

I usually go through the drive through, and service is always pleasant and very professional. They also get their orders out really quickly. 

They used to do classic cars there on Wednesday nights, but I'm not sure if they still do."}
{"text":"I love sonic for their happy hour drink specials -  this may be the only time I write that sentence where I'm talking about non-alcoholic drinks. My friend loves the cherry limeade. I usually go for a slushie. They also have happy hour deals like $0.99 corn dogs! I've only gotten food here a couple of times. It's not my favorite, but if you just want a refreshing drink on a hot day head to sonic!"}
{"text":"Not good customer service. Had to wait at drive up menu for 5 minutes and no one answered. Had to back up and pull back up, asked if everything was ok in side because the place was dead!  Not fresh hot food either,  was disappointed because I was craving tots!"}
{"text":"Great Sonic Blast. I dont get the food because they always screw it up, but their drinks are awesome."}
{"text":"I can't say I really care for sonic, their food is just eh. I like their drinks however. I actually wasn't even sure if this location was open as it was empty. But it was, the staff was friendly my order accurate."}
{"text":"Sonic is my one stop shop for a good meal and dessert for cheap! Their menu is full of so many different things so you can literally have whatever you're craving. Babe likes the crispy chicken sandwich and I'm more of the mozzarella sticks / chili cheese hot dog type. They're really generous when you ask for extra sauce. I love marinara sauce with my mozzarella sticks. And don't even get me started on their drinks! So many options! You can have slushes, teas, limeades, shakes, coconut water, soda... anything you are thirsty for they probably have!! I enjoy getting their cherry limeades  but what gets me coming here late nights are their shakes. They have so many different types it's crazy! And they're thick. I love thick shakes. Don't forget to grab a vanilla cone or a small sundae which are great for the price! I'm so glad they're close to home. Yay sonic!"}
{"text":"Their service was quick and fast! I really enjoyed their new boneless buffalo wings! Super saucy and that's the way I like it! The Cherry limeaid we a little watery, but that's okay. 

The area is super far from my house but it's a nice location. Definitely happy with the stop I made!"}
{"text":"Usually Sonic is an awesome spot to stop at, but this one must definitely be avoided!!! The drive-thru was an extremely long wait. When we finally got to the window, our order was messed up. I got a chocolate brownie shake and specifically asked for no caramel. He looked at it and went \"oh, I thought you meant all caramel no brownie.\" Then our food came out and he said that all we had to wait for was my shake. After I received my shake, we went to park to eat at the tables. Once my boyfriend took our his bacon cheeseburger, they forgot to put in the BACON! Kind of ironic to order a bacon burger with no bacon, LOL! They also forgot to give me extra marinara sauce when I specifically asked for it for my mozzarella sticks. We had to push the button again and order them. A couple mistakes can go a loooong way, sonic."}
{"text":"I usually like going to Sonic when I get that sort of craving. Whether it's a hot dog, to tater tots, to the late night milk shakes. This time I wanted the mozzarella sticks. They didn't taste fresh and I could tell that it was like an old batch or some sort. I've had them before where they melt in your mouth, are extremely hot, and tasty... but this time... no way. I'm most likely gonna stay away from it from now on.

It'd be one star except I'll be back for their happy hour which is every day from 2-5pm. No one can beat their 50% off drinks."}
{"text":"Really good tasting food only complaint is slow service, and the price
Other than that, this place is a great hangout"}
{"text":"So I went to the Sonic Drive-In at 3330 E Thomas Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85018 this morning to get a cup of ice. Paid with a dollar bill, and even told him to keep the change. Simple right? Well as you can see from the photos, I got a little bit more than ice.

I called the store, spoke with \"manager\" Jesse, and asked him if the neighborhood we live in has to do with them selling us TRASH. I expressed to him that I have had multiple issues with this store (resulting in free food), and wanted to know what I could do to help them be better. He apologized, said he would check the ice machine, and offered to replace the cup of ice.

I told him this has nothing to do with ice replacement, it has to do with them doing better - asking again what I can do to help. Jesse offered to check the machine and replace the ice again, to which I responded \"I'm just going to avoid you all.\" He responded...\"ok.\""}
{"text":"I have to say that if I get what I want, in the expected amount of time, delivered with great service, and it is so good it keeps me coming back for more...you deserve 5 stars. Thank you Sonic for delivering one great diet cherry limeade after another!"}
{"text":"Two stars Bc it's sonic.

This location just sucks.

Wrong food- forgotten food- always have to repeat order multiple times- have to always check for sauces and ask for he third time.

Not just once or twice, but every single time.


It's just a pathetic representation of sonic."}
{"text":"Waited almost 15 minutes for 3 shakes, went in to ask for them and all they said to me was that they were backed up. No apologies for the wait and they were melted by the time we got them. Not happy with the service we received tonight."}
{"text":"Good service and food wasn't too bad. The Oreo shake was absolutely delicious, hands down the best shake I've ever had. The cherry slushee with pop rocks was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Love love love the Route 66 Lime Slush.  Extra lime.  Thank you.  It cure whatever ails me.  In a pinch the Limeade will do but the slush is the thing for me.   It's a great diuretic and mighty tasty too.  I lime to go during Happy Hour when they are half price.  Oh my yes.  I could go every day but don't.   That would be wrong.   Now the food us another matter.  It us not good.  Sometimes a coney dog and tots are OK as are the onion rings.  However the burgers are not tasty, the toaster sandwiches are wet and the salads are an affront to salads.  Pitiful sad.  But the lime slush totally makes up for it.  I just get that or the occasional milkr shake when they have a sale or bogo.  The lime slush is simply ambrosia, nectar of the gods.  The staff is decent.  I feel badly for any Phoenix carhop.  The microphones are awful."}
{"text":"Good late night eating at this location. I love sonics nerd frozen drinks and they did not disappoint at this location."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start right now and I can't hold in how I feel about this location anymore. I keep thinking that maybe it was an isolated event and it's not. I've been there on several occasions and each time I give them the benefit of the doubt that my experience would be different. Pff, silly little man what were you thinking? SAME POOR SERVICE AND HORRIBLE QUALITY...

So, let me start from the top when I gently glide to the order menu...knowing already what I want. Before I order, Andrew proceeds to notify me that their card system is down and cash is the only acceptable option at 11:30PM (Basically, we close in 30 minutes and none of us want to work anymore). I scrounge around in my car for a moment to see if I have cash (which I rarely do...also what they were banking on) and I did. I proceed to place my order, then cut off midway through because apparently he can't hear me. I repeat myself 5 times (no exaggeration), before I frustratingly yell \" Give me a fucking #7 and Cinnabon sticks please!\" He gives me the total and I pull up to the window, to be handed a sopping wet Coke Zero. The drink is spilling from the top down all sides of the foam cup from which it's contained, wet paper clings to the straw being smashed together as Kaylie (manager) hands me the drink to place in my car I spent 3 hours detailing earlier this morning. I pull up to a further to get someone's attention for napkins. Can you guess what all FOUR of them are doing? Working? No! Leaning against the counter conversing until they see me looking at them then scramble to look busy. 60 seconds later I have my cinnamon bun sticks and coney meal. I also ask for napkins for my drink and proceed to wipe it down. I apologize for losing my cool at the order menu...which he replies \"we're used to that here\". I wanted to say, if you guys just did your job you wouldn't be \"used to that\" there. Instead, I bit my tongue after he offered to take the wet napkins I used to dry my drink and pulled off. 
I get home to discover my tots are rock solid and not even hot...I immediately gave my daughter her Cinnabon sticks that looked legit and headed back to the location. I pull up to the order menu and get Andrew's lame speech again. I proceed to say 2 words before he says I can't hear you and immediately drive to window. I literally, give them bag of food and tell them I want a refund and a replacement for the order. Kaylie comes to the window and I proceed to tell her how I feel, which is...Because of my frustration and their inability to do their job my order was intentionally sabotaged. The drink, the tots and didn't want to see what was wrong with the coney. She pauses and proceed to ask me for my receipt of a cash payment they conveniently didn't provide the first time around. I laugh and ask her if she's really going to pretend I wasn't there 5 min ago? She looks at me and pulls up my order receipt, gives me cash for the meal ( just the coney meal) and preps my order again. By now it's 11:55 PM and get a fresh batch of tots and new presumably a new coney. 
I get home take a few sips of my drink and munch on a few tots before biting into a stale bread, hot dog that looks like it was cooked earlier that morning and cold ass chili and cheese. I rest my case this by far the worst Sonic on earth and don't know how they're still open. I used to have a genuine love and desire for Sonic until experiencing this location. I love eating healthy but when I cheat I want it to be worth it."}
{"text":"Just left there with our drinks and they were amazing! I even tried the new wildberry lavender shake and it's pretty good. Most importantly our server was amazing, quick and friendly. As busy as it was she made sure everyone received excellent customer service! Dani, thank you so much for making our night. It didn't go unnoticed. We will definitely keep coming to this sonic."}
{"text":"A coupon from the grocery store receipt let me get a free Sonic Burger with the purchase of one Sonic Burger. So, why not? Although it doesn't apply to the combo meal, it's still a killer value.

That they ask if you want your burger with mayo or mustard, as opposed to ketchup [:sick:] is even better. I love mayo. Now, if they start carrying baconnaise, I'll make much more of an effort to go here on a regular basis.

This location had a limited time offer of any drink/slushee any size for $1. This is wonderful, as you can get a large blue coconut slushee, drink off a couple of inches, top it off with Malibu rum and have a little party in the afternoon. Sweeeeeeettt!!!"}
{"text":"Never been to sonic before so we tried it a few weeks ago and of course the drive thru messed up the order so we called and they said sorry and offered to replace the order on the next visit.   Fast forward to today.   Went in and got the order replaced and a few other things.   They messed it up again and the other items werw just not good quality.  Last time I'll give this place a try."}
{"text":"The food is decent, as you would expect to be but their drive-thru always takes so long. With only one car in front of you I can easily take 10 minutes just to get your order in. Not the best place to come if you're in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Overall we enjoy the food here, but the service is notoriously bad when they are busy. This last visit my boyfriend had to repeat the order twice only to have the drive-in woman stop answering us. After saying excuse me twice, she replied with \"take your time\". We asked if we had to repeat, and she said sure. We were told no ice cream, and then she recited the order back to us it wasn't what we wanted,  but we just said sure back and decided to be happy with what she had decided for us. As we left the drive-in, we were not even given the shakes we agreed to. They left the window open and we're talking rudely about the woman in front of us who they had asked to move up. We are considering not returning to this location."}
{"text":"Came to get drinks for my nephews and I. They spilled some of my drink in the cup holder. Then drinks aren't cool like they are suppose to. Smh this place is losing their touch. Ain't coming back to this one. And I live around here smh."}
{"text":"The management at this facility has clearly shown that they do not teach customer service to their staff. Especially when the staff argues with a customer about what they said. I simply stated that the price on menu was different than the price on the screen and all she could say was I don't know what to say to you about it. I then pointed out that she had charged me for a blast instead of a shake. She then proceeded to tell me that is what I had ordered. I asked her to learn some customer service skills and I proceeded to leave the store I will not spend money with a management team that will not teach their staff any customer service skills."}
{"text":"Just had the worst service ever. Took 15 minutes to get cold food. Asked to speak to the manager and he would not talk to me. I will be calling the GM and talking with him to get my money back I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to give this place 1 star when I would rather give it a -1. Went through the drive through on my lunch. I literally waited 25 minutes and my car did not move. Did you get that??? My car did not move. There were 2 cars in front of me and about 6 cars behind me
 They all eventually left which gave me room to leave as well. I am so disappointed in the customer service. I called to complain and the man who answered the phone said he was the manager. I asked if he was aware of the large amount of cars that had backed up and eventually leave, he did not respond.  I let him know that the wait to order was 25 minutes long with no possibility of ordering in sight. No response. Finally, he says, \"ok\". Really,??? Just ok?? Then I let him know I was going to leave a dissatisfied Yelp comment. I asked his name, he hung up on me. So, Sonic....your \"manager\" is not managing correctly or the customer service would not have been neglected in addition his professionalism is not up to par when he hangs up on customers. I like Sonic, I don't mind the wait but to wait 25 minutes just to order is certainly not worth it. In and Out is usually a long wait but well worth the wait. I can't say the same for Sonic. Check your management."}
{"text":"This Sonic location always has excellent service and quick service. I come here during happy hour and despite the long lines I'm always in and out of the drive thru in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Want service with a smile? This is the place. I have been to this location on a number of locations and every person who works here is extremely friendly and kind. It's amazing. Food is typical for Sonic."}
{"text":"Service with a smile. That's what I've come to expect and receive from Sonic. I only end up here when it's between 2-5pm for their happy hour, but service is friendly and efficient and I can't ask for better than that."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was great.  I got the hot wing combo and there was a ton of buffalo sauce on my wings which I like I had to order wings and get dry wings. Jose the manager came out and checked on me to make sure everything was good.i'll be back"}
{"text":"Drive thru is soooooo slow! I got an Oreo shake and there were probably 2 tiny pieces of Oreo and those were at the very bottom at that :( for the most part I had a vanilla shake that took 20 mins for me to get. I was very sad. This was my second try at their Oreo shakes too, I had the same experience the first time and decided to give it another shot. Never again :("}
{"text":"Waited over 20 minutes in the drive-thru after I ordered to get a double cheeseburger and a small fry. There was only one person in front of me. I didn't even get an apology for the wait. 

After all that time, they screwed up my order by giving me a \"double cheeseburger\" with one burger patty and two pieces of cheese. 

Way overpriced and not worth it. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"A quick drive in so I will give a quick review. 

The Slush Drinks are great and if you get it before 11:00 am the large drinks are $0.99. My favorite is the grape slush but beware of the brain freeze if you drink it to fast.

The foot long coney dog with chili and onions are always fantastic.  Look for coupon specials in the newspaper or online where you can get a buy one get one free. 

The 3rd must have is the tater tots which are one of my faves. 

Their buy one get one burgers are also a good buy when it is offered. 

I love the slush drinks and in the AZ Summer they certainly hit the spot during the 100 degrees days.

The skating concept is funny but leans a blast from the past so it is good to see that tradition being upheld.

Overall I will keep on coming back for the main 3 items."}
{"text":"Living in the desert at +100 degrees the Grape Slushes are great but beware of the brain freeze.

One of my favorites is the foot long coney hot dog with chili, onions and mustard. So good for a quick bite. 

Quick service and fun employees that make a good overall experience"}
{"text":"Me and my  boyfriend ordered the #6. Our hotdogs were okay but the onion ring that i had had too much butter and hard to eat. My boyfriend was unable to finish his fries to cause the fries he got was not tasty."}
{"text":"Longest wait ever at a drive thru. No Bueno. No thanks. 25 minutes!  Lol. No.  The attendant had a really hard time understanding my order. Super simple - small tator tot and small jumbo popcorn chicken. She couldn't grasp that I wanted a SMALL jumbo popcorn chicken and small tot. AND RUDE AT CHECKOUT"}
{"text":"I like Sonics food, but the speed and service here is not good.  Always a long wait for food and on my most recent visit most of the food was missing from my bag.  Always leave there stressed out."}
{"text":"This has always been the only sonic I've been to closer to home. The service is always great, food is delicious and consistency good. My favorite is the strawberry Lemonade, corn dogs and their American hot dogs. General area is very clean, QT is located across the street from here. I love it and think its a great location to go to for a quick meal"}
{"text":"Great place to get a late night drink or snack but the night crew tends to be very cold and off putting. Doesn't stop us from getting our midnight shakes though!"}
{"text":"Shoutout to Samantha for giving the best customer service I have ever seen at a sonic. I hope the manager reads these reviews, because Samantha is top notch and made me want to come back to sonic everyday."}
{"text":"We went through the drive-thru as opposed to waiting until they came out due to the heat.  To be fair their was only one car ahead of us, but the time from order to receiving food was good.  Food quality was as I expected from Sonic and the employees were nice."}
{"text":"It was so windy yesterday and I like most of the country found myself getting cheese sticks.  The car hop was so busy with customers and blowing everywhere yet he managed to have a smile and be so pleasant!  The food was exactly like every other sonic but the service was a step above!!"}
{"text":"I've been in the drive thru for more than 10 minutes because the employees didn't tell this woman in front of me to pull over while her long ass order was prepared. If I wanted to sit here forever I would have pulled into a stall. I'm disappointed today."}
{"text":"Sonic is fast food... every time I come here it takes 10-15 mins... my Cranberry limeade should not take 15 mins are y'all crushing the cranberries by hand ?"}
{"text":"Fast service. Free medium drink if you check in on FourSquare. Also good deals on their texting thingie. The manager was really nice and helpful. I'm glad they stopped using those horrible paper cups that made my blasts and shakes melt before I even drove off the lot! :)"}
{"text":"Come here often late night when Rudy is working. By far the best employee here or at any other establishment. Always very nice & gets my order quickly."}
{"text":"After having ordered at the busy drive through, it seemed our order was overcharged. We could not get their attention so we pulled forward and while waiting for the cars in front of us, phone called this Sonic. 
The call was answered right away and the gentleman, Michael Joyce, crew leader, came out to our car and made it right before we even needed to pull forward. 
Kudos to Michael for his great customer service and not charging us for Sonic Splashes rather than the carbonated waters, with no flavoring, in which we ordered. It's really no big deal to begin with and he did not nit pick or argue the point but instead was happy to express that which IS important - a sense of good quality and service. 
The few Sonics that overcharge, for selling something that was not asked for nor included simply because they can charge for absent flavoring by pushing a different button on the register, lose more business and respect than the meager dollars and cents they may gain for corporate's sake. 
Five stars earned because this good employee can think for himself on behalf of the company he works hard for."}
{"text":"There is something to be said about seeing a carhop on rollerskates.... It makes me think of when I was younger and visited my very first Sonic. I remember looking with awe and envy at the beautiful carhops, because I hadn't learned to skate yet. Almost instantly my insecurities were hushed with my very first Cherry Lime-ade. That kick in the mouth is what keeps me coming back again and again. 

This Sonic may not be the smae as the one in my hometown, but it is up to snare. The service is fast, friendly and always on wheels."}
