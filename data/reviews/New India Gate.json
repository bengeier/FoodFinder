{"text":"First time eating here with a girlfriend and we're both hooked! Came for dinner and since there is no dinner buffet we tried a couple things off the menu. I will say everything was awesome, and their tandoori chicken was especially amazing. Super sweet and attentive service. Awesome experience, and I honestly might do a takeout order asap because I'm craving it already."}
{"text":"The food was not impressive . Took a friend who was visiting to try out this new restaurant . Ordered paneer masala and malai kofta . Kofta was like a bonda in gravy and paneer masala had raw onions in them"}
{"text":"Super impressed with this find. Weekend buffet exceeded my expectations! Our \"go to\" spot has been cutting back on quality for some time now and I thought it was time to try some place new. So glad I did. Star of the buffet was the paneer tikka masala. Many layers of spices, butter/ghee, and tomato goodness. The owner's son (I believe) frequently checked on us, refilling our drinks and asking how we liked it. I gushed over the tikka and he told me everything is homemade there, even the sauces they offer - Chutneys.  You can tell! The paneer cheese had a satisfying chew and creaminess. How is this found on a buffet?? I was impressed. Not only with the buffet spread but the level of care, sincerity and obvious personal investment shown for the restaurant's success. veg samosas also offered and were quite crispy and delicious, which is not what I'm accustomed to at \"other\" buffets. Fried food is usually soggy unless you get it within 30 minutes or so of coming out. I appreciate that both vegetarian and meat options were available and oh, the naan they brought was pretty darn good. Also, chai tea at the buffet. You sweeten yourself. Loved! This is our new place for great Indian food and service :)"}

{"text":"Today my wife and I visited this place to try the food as we have an upcoming party. We were looking for a new Indian place to serve yummy food for our guests (expecting about 100-120 people). Our experience today was awful!!!! The food was terrible. The chicken tandoori was raw, the chicken dum biryani( it is not even called a biryani), curries had no flavor, the desserts were not good( the fruits in the mango custard were not fresh, the carrot halwa( I don't want to call it a Halwa. Very bad!!!)). It's good that we have tried the food before ordering for our party. We have ordered at \"Kabab palace\", \"Pastries N chaat\" and \"Chennai Fusion Grill\" for our previous parties and the food was never a fail. We love those places. This time we just thought we will try something new but we absolutely regret going to this place. We will never recommend this place to anyone( friends, family and colleagues). Finally, decided to go back to our old favorite spots."}
{"text":"I am fairly new to this cuisine, and this is the BEST! The food was amazing and I met one of the owners. We will be back again soon! Great!"}
{"text":"Not enough variety, but the service was GREAT and the price for the buffet is good, considering the fresh nans that get refilled:) I'd say it is more of a lunch place than dinner. Will try again."}
{"text":"Drove from the West Valley to try this one out and was not disappointed. Great quality of food. It's obvious this is made daily with high quality ingredients. Good selection in the lunch buffet and great service all around, from the initial greeting to paying the check. If you are looking to try Indian food or just need your \"Indian food fix\" like me, go here. Will definitely be returning for their dinner menu. Family run business the delivers on quality and value."}
{"text":"I recently stopped by New India Gate for their weekend lunch buffet, and was incredibly impressed. As a novice to Indian Food, I was a bit apprehensive that the buffet might be too spicy for my taste. I expressed my concerns to the waitress, and the manager (possibly the owner) ended up walking us through the entire buffet, dish-by-dish, explaining the ingredients in each dish, what to expect from a heat perspective and how to adjust the heat on-the-fly if it is too spicy. I'm not sure I've ever had a restaurant provide such a careful, detailed explanation of their food, and I was thoroughly impressed with their friendliness and desire to make sure I felt confident in making selections.  In terms of the quality of the food, I can't say I'm an expert at evaluating Indian food, but everything tasted really fresh and high quality, and they had a solid selection of vegetarian dishes on the buffet as well. I am a meat-eater, but the vegetarian curry was actually my favorite dish! Plus, if you go on the weekend they have an amazing mango pudding on the buffet (served Saturday and Sunday only)!  I'll absolutely dine at New India Gate again in the future!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I found this gem of a restaurant. It is  family ran. The two brothers that served us know what customer service is! The food was amazing.  We ordered alot of dishes to be able to experience a variety of flavors from Northern India. New India Gate has only been open for six weeks but has an incredibly well seasoned approach to family dinner, sharing as many samples as we would accept."}
{"text":"Delicious, I had the paneer tiki marsala. Ambiance was very quiet, at the end of my meal,had the whole place to myself.  I tried to call in a to go order, but I could not get through the phone line. When I got there I decided to stay as it was so chill.  Food was great, stuck to a classic. It was a little more citrus flavor than I am used to, but it was good.  Price is a bit higher for dinner than expected. All items sold separate. So one order with tip was over $20, but that will feed me 3 times..."}
{"text":"Amazing food and the owners are extremely personable.  They were able to accommodate our gluten free and dairy free diet.  Only suggestion would be to expand the wine list."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food and wonderful service.  We took my grandmother for her first Indian food experience,  and our waiter walked her through the menu and helped her to choose something for dinner.  The only caution I would give is to order one spice level below what you would typically get, as it was hotter than expected.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"This was a first encounter with Indian food for me and my mom... But I couldn't ignore the stars in Yelp. To say hospitality was king is an understatement. They treated us as if we were dining at their home. Excellent in every way.  We shared chicken tikka masala was spectacular and the lamb vindaloo was also excellent.   Give this place a try and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is just OK, there are many more much better choices of Indian restaurants nearby with in 2-3 mile radius. Service is horrible. They do exceed in decor which is more contemporary as compared to more traditional decor at other Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in town. Delightful family. The brothers are very friendly and have a love for people! Great food, great service! Gold Star from me!"}
{"text":"The service here was great! Our waiter was one the family members and he explained the menu to us and helped us pick dishes. He was so passionate and excited to give us a great dining experience. The food was incredible -we got the lamb vindaloo and tikka masala."}
{"text":"Awesome  food. ..friendly atmosphere ....loved their Naan bread and lamb curry...yummm"}
{"text":"They have been open for 4 months. Service by the brothers was great - attentive, courteous, explained every dish we asked. We had the mixed tandoori grill, chicken masala, fish curry, garlic naan bread and rice with vegetables."}
{"text":"Flavor flavor flavor! There is no shortage of such at India Gate. The staff was very friendly and helpful as they explained the buffet and some of the dishes that I was unfamiliar with. I probably had a third to half of the main entrees offered and really liked everything on my plate.  My only complaint was that I ate too much and fell into food coma."}
{"text":"This restaurant continues to impress our family every time we visit. The buffet is not only one of the best Indian ones, it's one of the best in town. From the food, service and drinks, this is one of our favorites.  Highly recommend visiting them during lunch. It's a family friendly place with a great vibe for all."}
{"text":"The restaurant is good. Great food and friendly service.  The goat soup is spicy and tasty. I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"We regularly visit New India Gate and can't say enough good things about the food and excellent and attentive service. It's clear the food is made from scratch with care, and the quality is consistently fantastic. We come with our two tiny daughters and they are accommodated like family. The chicken mahkni is delicious as is the lamb korma and all of the appetizers. The staff are happy to educate and make suggestions about the food which is really helpful. A wonderful family business that we're glad we discovered."}
{"text":"I don't see why this restaurant is rated more than 2 stars. The food is absolutely average Indian food. The service is good but its the food! We ordered lamb achari and shrimp vindaloo. The lamb was sooooo tough and hard to even chew. It had some sort of \"left over from a few days\" taste. There was no \"achari\" taste to the lamb. I would say this dish/recipe failed. The Shrimp vindaloo had no vindaloo flavoring, again dish/recipe failed. Now the pricing, the prices were high for the amount of food provided in each dish. The only positive was the Naan, it was soft and good. Overall, I would say our experience with the food was - i have had better Indian food elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Had a really nice dinner. Very friendly and the food was really good! We'd go back! I wish the naan was a bit bigger but I was still full and couldn't finish it. I was not disappointed with this place!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the East Valley! Beautifully prepared and served by a delightful family. Just opened last month. Delicious!"}
{"text":"No salt, no pepper, no spices, no masala in bhindi masala. Onion bhajji is not at all tasty. Would never come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet. The food was good, though I thought the selection was a bit small. The staff was friendly and it was pretty affordable. A good experience for sure, but I've been to places nearby that are a bit better. Still definitely worth a try, though."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided that we wanted to try Indian food and did not know where to go. A quick look on Yelp in the Chandler area brought us to this place, so we thought let's give it a try. This place did not disappoint. The food was out of this world and the staff was the best and most friendly ever. We will definitely make this place a regular for us."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for lunch buffet on Sunday afternoon . It is a wonderful experience for us. They provided a lot of decent food. Undoubtedly, it was so yummy!! I really like the fried rice, goat and eggplants. Ahhh delicious! The service was good. They were so nice to us and gave us the tasty naan. The price is cheap $8.99 (Mon to Thur) and $9.99(Fri to Sun) in the afternoon. l will comeback next time!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken curry, medium and it was excellent!! I also ordered garlic naan. Naan was good but a bit on the crispy side. Flavors of the curry were spot on!! Great job and I cannot wait to get back!"}
{"text":"This is the best Authentic Punjabi( aka North Indian) food u will get in town. It's not your average Indian food loaded with fillers and creams to make you full. Instead it's fresh hand made traditional north Indian dishes prepared meticulously. My Punjabi wife eats only at one Indian restaurant in the city and this is it for us !! If the food isn't enough, this family owned restaurant will show you what friendly service is all about. We are regulars here already, and you should join in too."}
{"text":"The brothers running the place do an outstanding job and the food is just perfect.   We ordered separately to compliment our leftovers after our meal.  Best Indian food I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Our family has eaten at dozens of Indian restaurants.  This one is the best.  The service is better than we've had at 2 star Michelin restaurants.  There's a reason this place has so many 5 star reviews, the food, the service...amazing.  Forget comparisons to other Indian restaurants, this place should be compared to the best restaurants period.  Save room for the Gajar Halwa, best dessert around.  Food is prepared buy a husband and wife and you can taste the pride and love they put into each dish.  One quick example of the quality of ingredients at this place; the Saag Paneer is cooked with Spinach grown at the chefs home.  Restaurants like this should be praised and deserve our business."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate there for dinner. We had the vegetarian Snack, Tikka Masala and Chicken Biryani. Everything was delicious! We found our new favorite place. Our server was also provided the friendliest service. We can't wait to go back again and again."}
{"text":"This was our first Indian restaurant, and our waiter was very patient while we were asking about which foods he recommended. The food was great, and the service was excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal."}
{"text":"I went with my husband and 4 year old daughter after shopping, and this place was amazing! Very authentic home style fare that has something for even the most picky eaters.  My 4 year old, who can be very finicky, fell in love with the paneer tikka masala!  My husband (who has never had Indian food) ate everything available. Everything! TWICE! I don't get that kind of reaction with my own cooking (don't judge). The owners were there and came by to say hello as well. Overall it was a nice atmosphere and we had a great experience.  We will be going back again for sure!"}
{"text":"It so nice to write a 5 star review for a Indian restaurant.  People run don't  walk to experience this fantastic restaurant   When you walk in the aroma knocked me over the place is clean comfortable.  And best of all the food and the service were awesome.  I had the Samosas the beef ones THE BEST IVE EVER HAD!!! Gopi the manager/server was attentive friendly and over all made my visit like I was eating at his house.  I ordered the chicken Tika Masala 5 stars I ordered it Indian hot it was divine.  The basmati rice was flaky and delicious.  The only odd thing is they charge for the rice ?  Never seen that before. The buttered Naan was made to perfection. Over all I wish I lived here I would be going all the time. Hopefully they will have a family member open up this restaurant in Texas!!!! Great job New IndianGate your a hidden gem !!! Sincerely Tony!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this a try last night and I am very glad I did. Ordered chicken tikka and a lamb korma accompanied by keema naan. Chatted with the two sons while the food was prepared and they are incredibly knowledgable and passionate about what they do. These are all family recipes and the process they use to prepare everything is as caring as it gets. The chicken was perfectly marinaded and cooked - great hint of lemon from the marinating process and the marinade was tasty and not overbearing. The korma was creamy and flavourful and the lamb was as tender as it gets. Keema naan was a great accompaniment. I will definitely be going back and I advise anyone to give this place a try. Great job"}
{"text":"My son and I had a fantastic dinner here a few nights ago. The two brother who run the restaurant were both fabulous. Food was excellent too. Great add to the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious food. This is one of the few restaurants that offers this variety and it was All delicious. Recommend the Chicken Makhni."}
{"text":"I went during lunch with a coworker and to my surprise it was really good. I have only had a few Indian dishes in the past, but this place has a variety of items to choose from. Good price for a buffet compared to Chinese buffets."}
{"text":"drove all the way from casa grande to being back the best indiana food ever!!!! plus the owners ate super friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent family owned and run restaurant. The staff was so nice and friendly- and spend extra time explaining all the dishes to us. We went right at 5 and the restaurant surprising was getting full by 6. My husband and I LOVED our dishes- the best Indian food we have ever had in Phoenix. The server told us his father is the cook and he is always there he never lets anyone else cook to keep their quality high. We had our toddler with us and they even brought him out his own rice on the house. When we couldn't decide on dessert he brought us a sample of the one we decided against. Seriously the best customer service and food. We went for dinner but are ready to go back for the lunch buffet so we can try several dishes at one. Defiantly give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet that I have been to in Arizona. The food was very fresh tasting, the nan was good, and the service was excellent.  I'll definitely be returningtothis restauranr!"}
{"text":"Great price for the variety of buffet selection! Customer service was excellent. One of the brothers took his time to explain what's in the dish and how to eat it! Food selection was wonderful with an equal mix of vegetarian and meat selections! The food was perfect for the price! Enjoyed both the food and the service! Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"1st time here - we will be back!! We were pleasantly impressed. Clean and airy, with a welcoming staff - not the typical strip mall eatery.  Sorry no pix - we were hungry and began eating as soon as the food appeared.  On the table we had: chicken tikka masala; chicken tandoori; shrimp korma; garlic naan and rice. Tried the mango and pistachio ice cream.  We're looking forward to trying the lunch buffet soon !  When the check came my husband said \"reasonable too\". This place gets 5 stars and our best wishes for their continued success!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, lots of flavors without being overwhelming. The menu is robust with seafood, lamb, goat, beef and chicken. The staff is fantastic!!!  You don't want to miss this gem."}
{"text":"The two brothers running this restaurant provided the best customer service we have ever experienced. We ordered the vegetable samosa, chicken vindaloo, lamb curry and garlic naan. All were right on point and weren't oily like other Indian restaurants we have tried. One brother offered us samples of their mango lassi, and it was delicious! We will definitely be ordering that next time we visit. Can't emphasize enough how stellar their service was. Will be returning to try their lunch buffet soon! On top of that, they are open 7 days/week!"}
{"text":"This was our second time here, and once again the food and service did not disappoint. The staff is tentative and the food had great flavor. The chicken tikka masala was delicious and had just the right amount of spice.  Highly recommend the lamb vindaloo as well.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"Local, fresh, and flavorful Indian food in Chandler. The lunch buffet is one of the best deals around and is delicious. Lots of variety and a welcoming staff."}
{"text":"I stopped by on 12/5/2016 for lunch, hoping to find decent Indian food here in the valley. The food was fantastic.   The buffet had a decent selection of options and all had unique flavors and lacked puddles of oil seen at other places. The naan is perfect. The service is very friendly and attentive.   I look forward to trying this place for dinner.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Our go-to for Indian food from now on!  The flavors, freshness, and love that are poured into the dishes we had tonight made New India Gate really stand out.  We started with the garlic naan, perfectly seasoned with just a touch of butter and garlic, and continued on to the chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, and the tandoori mixed grill (we asked for mild spice on each dish as our son was eating with us).  All gorgeously prepared, all very fresh and delicious.  The owners served us and were engaging and knowledgeable, happy to answer all our questions.  We plan to recommend and return as often as possible!"}
{"text":"Ate here, thanks to yelp reviews.  My husband, who dislikes indian food, absolutely loved it. The food was fresh, restaurant very clean and service was perfect.  Would have liked to see a few more items on the buffet, but, every item there was delicious."}
{"text":"Wanted to order Indian today and most places were closed till 5... So I decided to try something new and new India gate had great reviews. The owner was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. My family and I order Indian at least once or twice a month. Our favorite dish is chicken tikka masala and biryani. And to be honest this is the best chicken tikka masala we have ever had. Most places over due the butter and cream leaving it very thick and heavy. We wanted to keep eating even though we were full. I highly recommend new India gate, and will definitely be in for the buffet soon."}
{"text":"Stopped into this restaurant as it was in the neighborhood. Food was amazing, service was even better. Ordered the chicken tikka masala (medium). 8/10."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious, and the service was the friendliest I've seen in a long time.    We'll definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"I really like this place ! The food is always good and the staff is awesome! You can't beat the lunch buffet and I can walk there. Anytime I'm craving Indian food I go here to get my fix!"}
{"text":"My colleagues and I just discover this joint today. The food was great and the service was classic. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I take my girlfriend to this place about twice a month. We really enjoy coming here, my girlfriend is a  little skeptical about trying new food but we're really glad that didn't stop us from coming here. Other than the excellent food, the environment is great! I don't know why some people wrote \"Are the reviews even real\"? Of course they are!  I just think you need to come here in order to have your own opinion and don't let the negative reviews stop you. We will continue to come here. (:"}
{"text":"First time at New India Gate. Ordered Take Out Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Vindaloo with some rice and naan and couldn't be happier. Pickup was extra quick and the food was hot and full of flavor. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this place for new and old lovers of Indian cuisine. Food and service were great."}
{"text":"So--- This is my first time having Indian food. OMG!!! Don't know what rock I've been living under but praise God I got out  just in time to enjoy dinner at New India Gate! Everthing was absolutely delicious- Chicken Tika Masala, Chicken Madras, Shrimp Korma. Have no idea what anything means and don't care; the  tummy rules HERE! Service is exceptional, the family owners are knowledgeable not pushy.... Lastly the Ice Cream (Kulfi) was a perfectly cool way to end a spicy bit of heaven! Yep---- I'll be back .... Uh SOON!!!"}
{"text":"This was some of the best Indian food I have ever had and the service was great too. Plus they have a happy hour, we will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is awesome . It is taste good and friendly price. The waiter there is very kind and nice also."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken tikka masala. We ordered medium cause I am the only one that loves a good heat in my family so I just ask for some of their red spice I can sprinkle on to make mine a little spicier. They had great customer service. Very friendly!!"}
{"text":"We had an incredible experience here. The restaurant is family owned and they are so genuine and kind. Phenomenal customer service and the food is delicious. The servers are incredibly knowledgable about every item on the menu and offer suggestions. We'll be back and will recommend to friends and family!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing. Super friendly and they take care of you!! The food was very good too! I usually don't like spicy food but the spicy level was the perfect level of being able to taste the food and get a little kick! If you are looking for authentic Indian food, this is definitely the place to be. I will be back for lunch!!"}
{"text":"The service was tremendous. It's refreshing to see customer service at the forefront of a restaurants business practices. It doesn't matter how good food is, if the people serving it are rude. This place hit a home run. The food was GREAT, and the service was awesome. An all around well run family business. I will surely be back."}
{"text":"Traveling through the area and found this great restaurant; loved the lamb and the spice level (very spicy) was just right."}
{"text":"Greatest indian restaurant in phoenix area. the service is excellent and the food is delicious"}
{"text":"Amazing home like food. The 2 brothers provide excellent customer service. They're very warm people. My mother is on a visit from India and this is our second time here. We love this place! She has jain food only, and these people make everything from scratch and thus, she gets plenty of options."}
{"text":"We went here the day before Mother's Day, and the food was amazing.  Once we started, it was hard to stop.  While everything was delicious, the lamb was my favorite.  The owners were very friendly too.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Tried his for the first time. This is az five star Indian food. Totally legit. Food was great. Ingredients fresh. All made correctly. Thank you owners!  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This family own and run restaurant exceeds every characteristic I find critical in one. It's very clean, and the setup is both open and airy. The service is appropriately personal and very friendly. Our server explained the menu options, and made sure my kids knew how to traditionally eat their dishes.  Unlike other Indian restaurants I've visited, New India Gate allows you to control the heat level on EVERY dish. This is wonderful, because I can't handle the heat and haven't been able to try dishes I wished I could! The most amazing part is my 5yo ordered goat, and LOVED IT! He hates every food his parents suggest, so I'm still amazed. He told us \"this place got five stars, but it should've gotten SIX!\" Plus, my other child kept murmuring \"this is delicious\" as he ate his chicken dish. I love this place, every part of it. The dad was cooking with mom, and the two brothers were servers. A+  (I was surprised to see any negative reviews, so went to read them. Every single one was a glowing recommendation - I'm pretty sure these guys wrote 5 star reviews, but didn't know to (or forgot) to choose how many stars to rate it! That means 100% of these reviews are positive!!!)"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while looking for a different restaurant and we are so glad we did! The lunch buffet was delicious! There was a wide variety of meat and vegetarian dishes and everything seemed really fresh. Even the kids enjoyed the choices and liked their meals. The owners were very friendly and attentive with filling glasses and bringing naan. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"First off, the food was amazing! Secondly, the family that owns this restaurant is so kind and open. I felt at home the second I sat down."}
{"text":"Ordered the lamb boti masala, it was wonderful. Great service as well! I will certainly return, this has become my new Indian food spot."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a reasonable price. The servers are friendly and very attentive. Many vegetarian options. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"good place   been here a number of times, wish the hours were a bit more extended....  good selection and choices especially for vegetarians.....  everything was tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant by accident when another Indian restaurant was closed for a remodel, and we're so glad we did! The food is absolutely delicious and the service is great. Our server was very attentive & we especially appreciated his willingness to explain the various menu items. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place was SOOOOO GOOD. Nuff said!"}
{"text":"Liked the ratings so made the trek to New India Gate.  The staff were the most welcoming people.  They took the time to explain about the papadum and the tamarind sauce and the green chutney.  I didn't have the heart to tell him that we are veteran indian food lovers.    We tried the beef samosas as an appetizer.  We got two of them that had a nice size to them and they were almost greaseless.  They were also full of meat.  I just wished that they had more aromatic herbs in them.  Maybe a touch more of cardamon.   Ordered the New India Gate biryani which has both lamb and chicken.  It was not greasy but the flavors were not as good as we expected.  We have had much better.  The portion was big for the price.  The texture of the rice was fine.   We also ordered chicken vindaloo which was delicious by my standards.  Had that nice vinegary taste that traditional vindaloo is supposed to have and had plenty of potato chunks to soak up that wonderful sauce.  I was super pleased with my selection. For dessert, I had Kheer and though the raisins and nuts were missing, I enjoyed it nonetheless.   The customer service is excellent.  Reason enough to go and be served good indian food.  They give a Yelp discount of which we took advantage.  I hear they have a buffet 7 days a week at a reasonable price.   Thanks for the great meal."}
{"text":"**Lunch buffet is somewhat limited in variety, but everything on it was very good.  They change up the dishes every day, so its not always the same old thing.  I will be back for more.**  I had a wonderful dinner and got to try something new.  I really wanted the lamb ashoka, that's lamb cooked in the juice from Indian pickle.  Our waiter brought out a little dish of the sauce for me to try, and it was delicious.  It would have killed me, though.  My stomach just won't put up with that kind of thing any more.  I'd never seen this dish any place else and so I learned something new, which is cool.  I ended up going with my standby mattar paneer, which was excellent.  As usual, I ate too much.  There's always room for kheer as far as I'm concerned.  The kheer was also wonderful.  Try this place if you're needing a fix of Indian food.  I can't wait for the next visit.  And I definitely have try the lunch buffet!  **its anchari not asoka**my bad**"}
{"text":"Freshest meat I have ever had in a buffet. Owner says all food and ingredient are made from scratch! The price is ONLY $7.99 week days lunch and $8.99 brunch! Regardless it beats the $15 dollars india buffet I have had!"}
{"text":"We went for supper and had terrific food! We are new to Indian food, have only tried it a few times, so really weren't sure what to order. One of the owners explained each item on the menu and told us about how it is cooked, spices used, and went on to recommend different things we could try. We ordered what he suggested and it was fabulous!! It wasn't expensive and we felt it was well worth every penny! We will surely go back for the buffet this time so we can try different things!! We live in North Dakota and visit about every 6 weeks. This will be one place we eat each visit!"}
{"text":"Wow! I've been looking for Indian food since I've moved here 10 years ago and this place has finally reached my expectations! The lamb is to die for! Not to mention everything is gluten free!! Except the naan but don't worry because they said they are working on one right now!! I live in north Scottsdale and will be making the 25 min drive for this amazing food!"}
{"text":"Visiting the place for the first time. Everything was perfect. The best garlic naan I have had in a while and both the curries(paneer tikka masala & malai kofta) were perfectly spiced."}
{"text":"Best tandoori chicken I've ever had!  This place is really good.  I liked every dish I tried and you could tell it was all homemade.  I got there right when they opened for the lunch buffet.  I got first dibs on all the new stuff they were bringing out and it was hot and fresh.  I always have a hard time remembering the names of most dishes, but they were all very good.  The chicken tikka masala was also amazing.  The spice level was perfect, just enough to make my nose run a bit.  I can tell this place has a strong grasp on spice use and levels and are masterful at bringing it right to the edge for buffet food that everyone can eat it and everyone will be pleased.  They fill your water as soon as you walk in and give you the option of plain or garlic naan.  I opted for garlic.  It's not as crispy as I'm used to, but it's still really good, and I think most people prefer the way it's prepared here vs. the crackery crispy type that I've had elsewhere.  This is strictly personal preference.  I spoke with the owner during my meal and he was very friendly and gave me a history of the restaurant, how long they've been open and their philosophy that \"everything we serve here is what we eat at home\".  It shows in their food for sure.  It's cool to have the actual owner tell you that his father is cooking for you the same thing he cooks at home for his own family.  The lunch buffet price is very reasonable.  Definitely go for the buffet to get a wide variety of everything.  They have a large selection, a nice salad section as well as several sauces which is very rare for an Indian buffet.  It's nice to have those sauces available.  My only one gripe.  My lady was unable to go with me on that day, so I promised to bring her home a dish.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala to go.  The owner asked me if I just want some from the buffet or they can make it scratch.  I opted to go with from scratch and asked for mild, since my girl doesn't need her food to be hot for her to enjoy it.  When he brought it out, it was a medium sized cup container of the entree, but there was no side of rice or naan bread.  Just the dish.  I don't know if he just kind of misunderstood what I was asking for, but I was charged more for the little cup of food than i was for the three plates (yes i had three don't make fun) of food I had at the buffet.  Maybe the owner can comment and I will switch to 5 stars if maybe I was confusing the way I ordered to go.  If not, I think this place would be perfect if they were to include a cup of rice and maybe a naan bread to make it worth the price.  The restaurant is clean and they opt to play Indian music with a contemporary twist, so you get a little something for everyone.  They keep the buffet very clean, they are attentive and fill your water constantly, which is good because this food can be spicy."}
{"text":"First time having Indian food in the Valley.  Staff is friendly and attentive.  Food quality was fresh and delicious.  One the owners took time to make sure everything was satisfactory for our visit.  Definately a place to try.  We will be back. Our taste buds are very happy."}
{"text":"We used to go to the old India Gate at Chandler and Kyrene and were happy to find out they are back open, and very close to us!  The food was just as good as we remembered, ordered the vegetable korma and aloo gobhi with veggie samosas, garlic naan and rice.  We were also happy they are delivering and the food was delivered promptly while the food was hot.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The customer service was great!! This was our first time trying Indian food so we weren't sure what to order. The young man helping us was really nice and took the time to offer suggestions. We ordered the chicken Tikka masala and the Chicken tikka. They were very flavorful and the naan was great as well. Overall the experience was great!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice (lunch and dinner) so far, and I do like it.  Five stars for lunch, definitely. There are various kinds of curry, and they serve chai (too bad I did not have a chance to try). I surely come back again when I visit Chandler."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Indian Food for a very long time.  Convincing my husband to try it with me took years.  I was pleasantly surprised when my hubby stopped here on our mini date night.  The room was smaller than we thought it would be but ended up being perfect! It was so relaxing. And quiet. I had a lovely glad of wine, and hubby tried Taj Mahal beer. Nothing particularly special about the wine. It had nice notes and was served in a perfect amount not chinsey at all. The beer however i had a sip it was crisp and clean but also left a pleasant reminder on The pallet.   The service/servers were so helpful in giving us recommendations and telling us what was most authentic. They were kind and patient. Overall very friendly and polite.  We enjoyed the veggie appetizer. The chickpea batter was on point!! The veggie fritter type item was my fave. Full of flavor , crispy, and great with the sauces they brought to the table.  The Potato samosa thing was also very good.  Seasoned beautifully.  There was a delicious cracker item they bring to the table that was dlish. The sauces one green had a bit of heat to it.  The brownish red sauce kinda Smokey,  kinda sweet was my fave.  Hubby had tive lamb vindaloo. He liked it quite a bit.  Said his lamb was cooked perfectly,  wansn't to soft had just the right bite to it. He got a medium spice, but said he should have done more heat. He likes spicy. I did taste the sauce it was rich and i could really taste the tomato base each flavor really stood on its own despite the level of spice.  I cannot remember what the name of my meal choice was.  It was recommend by the server. Loved that they had so much vegetarian items.... in my meal the sauce was amazing!! It was kinda sweet and creamy, so rich, full of spices. ..i could have swam in it it was so amazing. I soaked it up with garlic naan bread which was on its own a nice treat.  Back to my awesome meal; it had these veggie dumpling things in it which complimented the sauce nicely,  or maybe it was supposed to be the other way around. I cannot wait to return and try something new.  Maybe stop by for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I love to Indian food and when I come here, I am really glad I came. It's really great food plus the top notch service from these guys is some of the best. Highly recommended and the prices are great too!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really awesome! The food is very delicious and authentic. We ordered karahi tandoori chicken saag and it tasted just like made in typical Punjabi families. No sugar and cream added. Don't forget to try their Onion kulcha and pistachio ice cream too!!! Definitely coming back again!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is so good and the servers are always so nice! This is a must try!"}
{"text":"We have ate here for Dinner many times, and just tried the Saturday buffet. Hands down... An absolute \"MUST GO\" kind of  establishment. I am picky, no doubt. I do not hand out reviews and compliments unless one is well deserved, good or bad.   So, here we go!  The immediate engagement by the owners was perfect. They had and have no issue with sharing what is in, and how their food is prepared. I love the fact that they procure their poultry and (fresh) vegetables from local farms here in Arizona. My girlfriend is celiac and has to have a strict gluten free diet. We continually search for restaurants that are GF friendly. This is home. On our first visit, I was so impressed with how patient and honest they were. I mean, we must have talked for about 30 minutes (before we ordered), as to what is safe and what to avoid and how they handle the food, and so on...every detail explained.  The table linens are fresh and clean. No stains! Glasses, spotless! The silverware, no doubt, clean. Presentation of the tables have a classy charm, too. Whether you are single or on a date, married, or have a big family, New India Gate makes you feel welcomed and important. If you get the opportunity to meet Manuel, you will feel like he is their speciffically only, for you. He is a true gentlemen and very attentive. He will remember your name and say hello to you everytime. His service is excellent!  The food, simply stated; INCREDIBLE!!! I have my favorites....I won't share them. You will have to discover yours, on your own.  New India Gate is one of Chandlers most prized treasures in the city. You will not be dissapointed.   Hope this review makes you want to dine there....I am so glad we found this place. Enjoy and bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, we have eaten several times for dinner and had a great experience each time.  The saag and korma, my wife and my traditional favorites, we're both superb, and they did a good job with the naan.  The owner enticed us with some free samples of the mango lassis and we became converts.  The only unusual thing for us was rice was not included so remember to order some.  Even with this, prices were quite reasonable for high quality Indian food.  I do not typically like buffets so have not been here for lunch"}
{"text":"The service was super nice and everyone was dressed up so professional even if they were just bussing tables or mending the buffet. Went with Lamb Vindaloo, at waiter's advise. Normally I prefer seafood, but he was not wrong about the lamb... the lamb was soooooo tender and delicious, despite the hellishly spicy Indian-hot spice level I ordered. That was my doing though, and honestly I regret nothing because it was so delicious. Thanks for a great experience. I have to run the rounds and check out some other Indian places but you are number one on the list right now.   Was there supposed to be potatoes & tomatoes & chili peppers in the stew? Because it was only meat chunks, but the sauce was so thick I can't help but wonder if they are pureed into the sauce. I am very new to Indian cuisine, and again, I have no complaints, because it was sooo yummy.   Also, boyfriend brings home chicken tikka masala leftovers on a weekly basis, and even leftovers of that shit is dope. This is why I picked this place to try! Passed on lunch buffet (seems like a great deal) as they didn't have what I wanted to try.   Wish the rice were seasoned, only main complaint. And then every other reviewer chats up the garlic naan but it just tasted like American-ass pizza/garlic bread, just thinner. I was disappointed because that's what I wanted but turned out they had even tastier things to offer. Also was kinda bummed about the paneer pakora. It was so good, but basically cheesesticks with the added bonus of spinach. Once it was cool enough to eat, the cheese had solidfied (and i order cheese things because melty cheese is so amazing haha)  You have your pick of sweet & sour or mint for dipping, and the mint/herb sauce on the side is divine!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have had! The owners Gobe and his brother were awesome and so friendly. I'm so glad to find the best Indian food with wonderful owners. We are definitely going to be regulars and will bring everyone we know.   Dee & Roth"}
{"text":"The service is excellent, the family vibe is welcoming and the Malai Kofta is my favorite in the valley (and not just because it doesn't have raisins)."}
{"text":"\"Nailed it!\" Wow, I was so surprised on many levels today when I accidentally came across an Indian place while doing errands.  We have been to hundreds over the years in many countries but not able to find too many in Arizona!   Ordered to go: Meat samosa - (accidentally gave us beef instead of chicken but it was better than most and have a great flavor on the outside which was a surprise) Tandoori wings - tender and so flavorful, better than most we have tried anywhere including the \"wing\" place! Mater paneer - (peas and cheese) mild, and it really was mild because I can't do spicy which eliminates a lot of places for me. Chicken tikka masala  (mild again I can't do spicy and it was) ... wow, tender chicken breast and flavored.  Yup, one of the best butter sauces I have ever tasted.  And I love that is was not loaded with veggies because I like to dip my naan in it! Basmati rice - perfectly cooked and tender. Regular naan - (I prefer a little chewy and bendable to pick up food) and it was awesome. So happy I tried this. Service by the way was amazing.  Can't wait to do this again!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and crazy amazing service. It's clean, delicious, and the excellent staff here is very welcoming and attentive. The hot chai tea is a must-have, thank you for encouraging us to try it. The tikka masala and garlic naan were delish."}
{"text":"The food was great the host was very attentive. The handmade ice cream was the best part! Thank you for a great experience!!"}
{"text":"I wanted a little Indian food tonight, so went to The New India Gate based on recommendations here on yelp... I'm so glad I did!  I ordered togo chicken tikka masala and an order of garlic naan-bread (no rice, still doing no or low carb!) As far as spice goes they have a variety of them, but this time I opted for Indian medium (I really thought my head was going to explode because I wanted something between medium and hot, but either I'm getting used to it, it's 108°F outside, or I'm not certain it was just that hot!)  The chicken tikka masala was fantastic, so much so I could have drank the gravy it's in! The garlic non-was a little less impressive but sure did make it fun soaking up the gravy I didn't drink (see attached picture).  I'm not certain when I'll be in the greater Chandler area again, but if I am and I'm in the mood this will definitely be my Indian goto spot. You've got to like a place that's only five months old but the love and care they show really comes through in the cleanliness of the restaurant as well as the food.  Here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Yes  Return? Yes  Advocate? Yes"}
{"text":"I tried the lunch buffet yesterday, and the food was delicious and authentic.  I was immediately shown a table and brought a drink.  The naan was garlicky and fantastic.  The staff was super nice, and it's under ten bucks. This is my new favorite place.   EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Ordered couple of curries to go .. Entree is $11+ each. Very small portions( curry in 12oz container) and doesnt come with rice or condiments like papad, achar, etc. Not value for money. Ripoff. Won't order or go again."}
{"text":"Me and the Boyfriend head to this place 1-2 Sundays every month for their tasty lunch buffet.  Originally it was just a way to be introduced to Indian food, and boy do they Nail it.  Even though I can't pronounce most of the dishes, I go back for seconds every time! Food at JUST the right amount of spiciness, delicious flavors~ (get the mango drink!)  The service is exceptional, too. Over the past couple of times we've been there, the Owner has recognized and remembered us. Takes an interest in us, and thanks us for coming back, each time."}
{"text":"To start off, i would give New India Gate 3.5 stars, but cannot do so. I went on a weekday lunch with my grandparents and it was quite busy from the lunch rush. We did the lunch buffet which everyone else was doing as well. First of all, the service was friendly and quick. They refilled our drinks and took away empty plates quickly. The food itself was not the best, but it was good. I will have to go back to see if it was a one day thing, but the reason I decided to round down and give 3 stars only was because the meat dishes (especially the tikka masala) was almost without meat for the entire time we were there. I realize that it is a popular dish, but to not have it restocked was disappointing. Also, since there were so many people, the naan was only given in small amounts."}
{"text":"Definitely one the biggest and most varied Indian buffet and in the valley for great price. The space is large and the service is excellent. No wonder they were voted one of the best all-you-can eats in Arizona online.  Lots of different condiments and chutneys.  Different rices, meats, and pakora as well as deserts."}
{"text":"Really great food and alot of variety for  vegetarians.  During their buffet they had Sampras which are usually an extra charge. I will def be back for there lunch buffets!!!"}
{"text":"I've just had my lunch there and loved it! The place was clean, very friendly and attentive staff, the variety of lunch buffet was good and the food was fresh and delish! I'm a big fan of Indian cuisine and from now on New India Gate will be one of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"The buffet was delicious with lots of both vegetarian and meat dishes. If you have dairy allergies they allow you to bring in your own coconut milk and they custom make the dish for you at no extra charge. The desserts were also delicious. My favorite was the mango custard. The staff was super friendly and they checked on us frequently. I am coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This new place in Chandler is one of the best deals in the Phoenix metro area for lunch. I'm not talking only Indian food, but in any cuisine. And I'm Mexican... so you know I'm always looking for deals!  I've never been to India, but this buffet makes me never wanna go there because I say \"what's the point? I've already tasted its unique flavors here in Chandler!\" Joking aside... this place is phenomenal. The food is truly amazing and every dish is so different from the other.   Plus, the service from the owners of this place (especially the young man) is just excellent. Their combination of amazing food at a great price and their attention to detail will make this business prosperous.   Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley of the Sun!   P.S.- The review is for buffet lunch only. I haven't been to New India Gate during dinner hours."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre in my opinion.  I felt the palak paneer was watery like a soup with no flavor.  The malai kofta was burned on the inside of the kofta balls and the rest of the curry had a burned flavor as a result. The naan was thin and chewy instead of being thick and soft. They charge for rice which I personally feel is a rip off. The only thing they had that was okay in our opinion was the chicken tikka masala and even that was lacking. In my opinion, the reason this place gets high ratings is the service and ambience is really nice especially when compared to other Indian restaurants in the local area. But the food itself did not impress and I would recommend driving to Phoenix or Scottsdale for real Indian food in my opinion."}
{"text":"The place is awesome. Best Indian food in Phoenix.  The food is fresh. Less oil. My second visit here and I m coming back here again.   Enjoyed the chicken tikka masala(this is different, not the every Indian restaurant flavor), goat and lamb are so flavorful. Halal meat here. Cooked beautifully. The masala and meat blend together.   Love this place."}
{"text":"Got delivery tonight from New India Gate. Really great tasting sauces/gravies with all the items we had, but the portions were rather small for the price paid ($12-$16 per item) for a smallish styrofoam pot, with maybe 1 WE of sauce and meat. Our shrimp dish had only about 6 shrimp. The sauces were rather watery, a bit thin in my opinion. The saag paneer was very tasty though.  Want to give 3.5, but will go with 4 instead of 3 as the taste was good, but the value was not. Will have to try out the buffet for lunch in the future."}
{"text":"A very good experience starting with great customer service. The all-you-can-eat lunch buffet does lack a couple basic Staples of the Indian cuisine. The place is very clean and the staff is very welcoming."}
{"text":"Great food! Stopped by on a Wednesday night while traveling through the state. The place was pretty empty but I'm not sure why. Everything we tried (butter chicken, tikki masala, garlic naan, sauces) was amazing. The staff was super friendly too. They just opened a few months ago I think and I hope the have a great future. Awesome food!"}
{"text":"The flavors were good. I ordered the chicken tiki masala, lamb achari, saga paneer. Spices were good and tasty. But skimpy on the meats. Service was good and place was clean. I would go back for my Indian fix."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Tikka Masala and garlic bread ever.  I never had so much CTM in my life...it was very very good. These guys are authentic and family run restaurant....making some of the best Punjabi food ."}
{"text":"Found this gem (or should I say Star) of India.  Family owned restaurant that serves delicious Northern Indian Cuisine from Punjab region!  The dad and mom of this family can seriously cook!  This has been our 4th visit in two months, 1st time was for Father's Day and this recent visit was for our 20th wedding anniversary!  The bold flavors perfectly infused into the chicken biryani and the lamb bhuna are amazing!  It just doesn't end there, their chana, chicken curry, goat curry and chicken tikka masala is awesome and delicious.  This hidden gem is in my opinion is the best in the valley and in the state.  It's fairly new so not too many folks are aware, I'm torn betw letting everyone know and keeping this unknown gem to myself....but I'm gonna be a good person and path it forward with this review and letting the world know!"}
{"text":"I'm not a connoisseur of Indian food but I do enjoy it. My wife and I stopped in today and had the buffet. There were lots of vegetarian options and all were delicious. The naan was fresh and warm and excellent.   Service was amazing. Several different people came by our table to refill water glasses, refill coke, clear plates, and ask if we wanted more naan. This is now our go to spot when we want Indian food."}
{"text":"Buffet is really good. Tikka masala, chicken curry, curry pakora were all very good. Naan was hot and fresh and tasted sooo good, your choice of garlic or plain. They don't skimp on the naan either. You got 4 large pieces at a time. Others only give you a piece or two at a time. I was able to try both and actually liked the plain better. Servers were very friendly and took my plate as soon as I was finished and kept my glass full. I guess a family owns it, mother, father and two sons. The dad is legit with a turban and a huge smile ready to get you what you need. For desert I had some of the best rice pudding I have ever had at an Indian buffet, and you can never go wrong with the gulab jaman. All you can eat for less than 10 bucks! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food is decent- 4 stars- but the service is incredible! 5 stars for the attentive, kind, not-overbearing service. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Have been looking for good Indian food in the area and have finally found it.  Delicious food, reasonable prices  and great service. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"We have been here so many times in the past few weeks both takeout as well as their lunch buffet.  I would easily recommend either.  From their chicken tika marsala to their lamb saag we haven't had a bad meal.    The owners are great guys and very personable.  They try to get to know their customers and really make you feel at home.  As a final note, I never personally cared too much for Indian food or curry but that has definitely changed"}
{"text":"Been here many times for lunch with hubby and always forget to write a review.  This place is my favorite Indian cuisine in the valley. Very fast, friendly and great service with amazing  food to boot. The buffet menu consists of delicious and tasteful curry to tiki masalas. If you haven't tried, please do yourself a favor and try it soon.  Very reasonable prices as well."}
{"text":"Everything you'd want from an Indian buffet. Everything was hot and fresh including the garlic naan. I really enjoyed the mushroom dish which says something because I am a carnivore if there ever was one. The place is super clean and the service was above par. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious..... lamb, shrimp, mushroom. All three entrees we had were amazing. My first time having India food, I'll admit I was hesitant. Now I will definitely be back!!! Highly recommend!!! Even if you don't live around Chandler area it's worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time coming here and wow it is amazing. We went through our usual routine of trying to figure out where to eat but I was skeptical of trying a new place especially how hungry I was at the time. We made a great choice! I will be back to check out the buffet and will become a regular. I love the family owned atmosphere and everyone is so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I think this place is great! You have to ask them to put more food up on he buffet line because it's so good it goes fast! Love this place"}
{"text":"People who know Indian food need to try this place. It is truly Indian fine dining in a casual atmosphere at a moderate price. Very highly recommended. After 12 years of living in Phoenix, so far the best Indian food i have tried period. Its all about the chefs. The owners father prepares the meat dishes and his mother prepares the vegetarian dishes. Superb food and service."}
{"text":"Can't speak enough customer service here! The food is great but what makes the experience awesome is superior customer service. We had a variety of food - Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Tikka Masala, Shrimp Karhai, Mixed Tandoori Grill, Vegetable Korma, Naan, Raita. My ratings are 5-star for the Chicken Tikka Masala, Naan, Shrimp Karhai, and the lamb portion of the mixed Tandoori grill. I will definitely back here and I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My guy and I had to try this place due to all the great reviews.  Not only was the service amazing, the food was too!  It was absolutely delicious.  I can't wait until we can come back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing indian food.  We originally came in for the lunch buffet, and after that, decided we wanted to have dinner there the very same night!  All of the food was very fresh, extremely tasty, and well prepared.  The staff was super friendly and even let us try a sample of a delicious drink!  All around excelent place to eat in the area."}
{"text":"Initial experience is very good and they just opened lasted week. The 2 men that run the place are very nice and knowledgeable. The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous very well done!"}
{"text":"Very polite family owners serving customers. Best Northern Indian food I ever have at economical price. Dinning room is clean, bright and airy. Restrooms in clean condition. Chicken rice Bryani, Kima beef, Tandoori chicken are fantastic. Eat there several times and will return."}
{"text":"So I haven't been to their lunch buffet before which seems like an amazing time to come however I was in the area and decided to get something for dinner. I would just like to say that the people working here are so friendly and helpful which means a lot to me as someone who usually doesn't have Indian food often but wanted to mix it up.  Ended up going with my usual Chicken Tikka Masala which was good I thought but I feel that I should have gotten something new and different here, will have to ask for recommendations next time. However, the garlic naan here is simply unbelievable! It's some of the best garlic naan that I had and would highly recommend anyone coming here to try it as well. They also threw in some rice as well which was nice to see and really complimented the meal.  This was a great experience and next time I'll have to try out their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat out. What a hidden gem. They had fresh spinach from their own garden the last time we went to New India Gate! The staff are so friendly and really care about what they put on the menu and you can tell in the quality of the food.  I am planning on being a regular customer from now on."}
{"text":"Very delicious home style Punjabi food! My very first visit here and I left stuffed! The restaurant is very clean and open. We tried the Buffett and everything was so delicious.   The service was great as well, they made sure to come around and fill your water and fill up the bread.   They actually comped a Mango Lassi drink and it was soooo good that we actually purchased a second one. If you like mangos, you have to try this drink.   Overall, my visit was excellent, I'm looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved to Tempe and were looking for dinner spots.  We decided on New India Gate because of the Yelp deal and we were not disappointed.  We decided to do take out and ordered the non-veggie assorted snack appetizer, saag paneer, chicken vindaloo with naan.  We love spicy food and we ordered hot and it was perfect!  The staff were very friendly.  We definitely will return."}
{"text":"Really good food.The service was on point I like that they let you choose where to sit down and the mago drink is really good! Food was nice and hot temperature wise nothing was too spicy it was just right would definitely go again soon"}
{"text":"I was impressed with the lunch buffet. It's in the $9 range and includes naan, soup, vegetarian, non-vegetarian, dessert, and tea. The selection was basic but good 5 or 6 vegetarian selections and an addition 5 or 6 meat options. While everything I ate was good the bhindi masala was delicious. The staff was really attentive for a buffet--water was full, plates cleared, fresh naan offered. Great place for people new to Indian food or those who love it."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this treasure when I was in search of satisfying my craving for mouth watering Indian food.    I just got off work and chicken vindaloo was calling my name. I read the Yelp reviews on here and decided this is totally happening. I met the brothers who own this wonderful place and they were so friendly and helpful. The place is clean and spacious, to make room for the many people who will be excited to eat here as I was.    Chicken vindaloo- Yes, it's banging! I ordered it Indian spicy because I appreciate the heat. This was the freshest homemade chicken vindaloo I've ever had, and I frequently order this at any Indian restaurant I try.   Lunch: What a great variety and selection in their buffet! Everything I ate in the buffet was flavor heaven! I'm going to dream about their tiki masala until I can have it again. Curry chicken was delicious, mushroom matter was saucy, perfect over rice. They have pickled lemons!  It's another favorite of mine that not many Indian restaurants have out here and I enjoy it. I can already tell I'm going to live at this place. You'll easily become a regular here because everything about this place is full of joy.   I was told these were mom's recipes and man do they have a great mom! Their mom gave them a lifetime of good food! Holy cow.  I'm going to try everything on their menu. You definitely need to come here or you're missing out."}
{"text":"OMG,  This place was amazing.  Very good food, with great prices and a very hospitable hostess.  I love Indian food and I believe I found my spot."}
{"text":"I have not the slightest clue what all these good reviews are about.  This is the most lackluster Indian lunch buffet I have ever had.  Bland if not gross and most of the food was barely warm. By comparison the Indian restaurant in civic plaza is amazing.  Definitely don't waste your time or appetite here.  Sorry Indian Gate.  I wanted to like you and drove all the way over."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place on Yelp while visiting AZ.  The service here was AMAZING.  I have never seen such wonderful service at any other Indian restaurant.  Both of the brothers went out of their way to make sure our drinks were refilled and food was good.   on service."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Indian restaurant I've been to, since moving to phoenix! I found out about them during the Asian Festival the other weekend, and am so glad I made the drive to their location   I tried their lunch buffet, which had a 4 veggie-friendly options, a few different choices in meat (chicken, lamb, etc), and lots of desserts (the best part, yay!) Plus the buffet comes with complimentary garlic or regular naan, as well as chai tea..   I sampled pretty much everything, and could decide on my favorite dish, it was that good! The servers and owners were very welcoming, and quick to answer any questions. It was a great experience all around, and I'll definitely be back when I'm craving Indian food again!"}
{"text":"Great fresh Indian Cuisine! Took my friends and family there after my wife and I checked it out!"}
{"text":"Small buffet, but everything was very good! Clean, welcoming restaurant. Very friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in after she discovered this place and saw that so many fellow Yelpers were impressed. I have to throw my lot in with everyone else. The food was wonderful. We ordered the shrimp korma and goat curry. Both were just perfect, the shrimp was succulent and the korma was thick and delicious. We ended with home made pistachio ice cream that was probably the best dessert I've ever tasted.  Staff was so friendly and super attentive; even gave us free sample of the mango lassi, which was just perfect.  If your in the mood for Indian food this is a must."}
{"text":"I love love looove this place! The food is delicious, the service is fantastic, and you can order them on Postmates! I really like the brother owners - they are so friendly and likable. I have been here 5 times and I keep ordering the same thing because it's that good: Chicken Tikka Masala, Veggie Samosa, and Garlic Naan. To die for."}
{"text":"Service five stars, food four stars.  We really liked the India Gate.  My husband loved the chicken soup.  It was much too spicy for me.  The garlic naan was okay but wished it would not have been just four small soggy slices and just out of the oven.  The sauces on the vidaloo and korma were flavorable and fresh tasting.   Some of the chicken was fatty.  My husband prefers white meat but the dark was fine for me.  We ate everything served.  Next time we will request chicken breast meat."}
{"text":"BEST mango lassi I've ever had!!! Service was great! Food was satisfactory... I went for something new and adventurous as a main dish, but wished I'd gone with something more traditional and reliable. I will definitely be back to try another dish. The owners truly care about their customers and I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience with my family. One of my favorite Indian restaurants by far. Not only is the food amazing, but so is the service! The staff is very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I have been there several times with multiple guests.  The food has always been the best I have had in the Phoenix area.  The service has always been good as well."}
{"text":"I've been getting spicy paneer tikka masala, spicy malai kofta and garlic naan from here.   They're always very polite. I have not been disappointed. I can be picky about kofta but this one is so good, it's slightly less spicy than the tikka masala but in a good way.  Also both of those orders came with a side of white rice so I got 2 containers of rice which was more than enough.   I love this place and think it's a little less expensive than most other Indian restaurants I go to in Tempe."}
{"text":"I am in town weekly for an information security internship and so I have been going around to the local Indian restaurants. Every restaurant has let me down besides this one. New India gate has the most delicious Indian food I have found in AZ so far! Even better than every Indian restaurant where I live! \"Atlanta\" thanks so much for wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Everything on the buffet was delicious. Service was impeccable, and everything was spotless, to include their changing utensils at the buffet. I'd have to say this is my favorite Indian food ever!  Just excellent, and very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"I try to make it to the India Gate Restaurant at least two times each week!  There is a reason for this...the food is simply fantastic!  I typically have the buffet during lunch time.  The buffet has a wide selection of dishes...some of which vary day by day...but the primary staples can always be found!  The ownership and staff take great pride in presenting a good product in a warm inviting atmosphere...always being quite friendly with the guests.  Like I said earlier, the food is fantastic!  It is by far the best location to find delicious Indian cuisine in all of Metro Phoenix!  Be sure to stop by for an excellent meal!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The brothers who own it are very friendly and the service was great! Food on the weekend lunch buffet was fantastic! Some of the best naan I've had in awhile. Only strange thing was ice in the mango lassi... now that we know we'll order without. Chicken curry was out of this world! The entire place was very clean (something not always found in Indian restaurants.) We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place has excellent ownership! They spend time talking to you as a customer.  The food for a buffet rocks.  Yummy!  Try the goat. The sauces are delicious.   Desserts bliss.    Not overpriced.   Great food!!"}
{"text":"This lunch time buffet had all my faves, you also get to pick the naan you would like. Garlic of course! The hospitality is also the best.  There are a lot of choices at the buffet especially for my sister who has celiac. I of course love the rice with saffron, chicken masala and the saag. Mint chutney was a slow burn and I loved dipping my naan in it. Just writing this review makes me want to go right now. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This by far is the best Indian food I have had here in the valley!!! Even better the service was amazing. My fiancé and I came to try it but didn't feel up to a sit down meal. We sat at the car for a glass of wine while they prepared the food.  The bartender was super friendly and engaged in great conversation.  They brought us samples of custard and fruit dishes while we waited.   We will definitely be back for the food and for Gopi.  It was great talking with the staff there!"}
{"text":"Accidentally found New India Gate in a Google search, great find! Food and service are 5 star. Order Indian Hot for great flavor and to clear your sinuses. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch buffet with excellent service. We tried a little bit of everything and it was all awesome, including the dessert (which are Indian family recipes that the owners' mom makes) and chai. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great food! Everything was authentic, fresh and tasty. The service is world class. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Outstanding, tasty and a wonderful meal and dining experience at India Gate! If You're looking for some great Indian food this is the place! Come check it out... everything we tried was spot on!  We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience at New Gate. We went for dinner and shared the Chicken Korma, Lamb Madras, basmati rice and naan. All of it was so amazing and flavorful the servers were so accommodating and helped us really understand what we ordering. Their Chicken Korma is now my favorite Indian dish! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Their Chicken Tiki Masala is the best! It's like you just can't get enough. Both my wife and I agree, this is exactly what we were looking for.   Great restaurant, great people and to top it all off, the home made ice cream is unreal!"}
{"text":"Customer service and the food was fantastic! I will definitely be returning again and again."}
{"text":"Just got out and what can I say, it is Amazing! It is clean, great authentic cuisine and best part is the absolute exceptional service. I highly recommend this place!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I come here twice a week because the food is good, you have options like chai tea and dessert included, and the staff is really friendly. It's a great value for the price."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have ever had. Everything is fresh and the quality is amazing.  They will also cook the meat in any style you choose.  I ordered goat madras.  First time I ever had goat.  Melts in your mouth!!  You are missing out.  Eat here immediately!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indian cuisine in town! I don't normally write reviews but I just had to praise this place because of the excellent customer service they provide as well as the magnificent food!  My favorite dishes are the fish vindaloo with a side of garlic naan and the chicken masala  any of their dishes are awesome and you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Newbie to Indian food and loving every bite! I have tried several different items at this place and there has been nothing I haven't liked. Some faves - paneer masala, onion pakora, paneer pakora, vegetable korma. Staff is always extremely friendly and helpful. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I LOVED everything about this place. Family-owned and operated, great food, great service, food allergy conscious. This will be my go-to for Indian food from now on."}
{"text":"Top notch indian food in the valley. Fairly new place but the 2 brothers are doing an extremely good job of serving excellent quality indian food. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"Excellent service & delicious food!!  Took the family here tonight. I am a big Vindaloo fan and was looking to satisfy my cravings.  I ordered Lamb Vindaloo and the family got Tiki Masala. Both were amazing!  Totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was excellent. Definitely a place to go.  I definitely recommend this place. Very authentic."}
{"text":"Delicious North Indian & Pakistani cuisine, nicely spiced and decently priced. I loved the lentil curry and my wife enjoyed the spinach paneer. Scrumptious samosas, and the rice was tasty and plentiful. We got take-out. Compares with Woodlands Indian restaurant across the street. Looking forward to our next order."}
{"text":"Well - I've been waiting to update my review till I could clearly articulate my love for this place.   I intentionally came here when I was two days overdue with a baby to try and see if a hot curry would send me into labor.  The helpful waiter suggested I order the entrees \"hot\" and my husband and I followed suit.  We ended up with the lamb vindaloo and chicken tikka both hot.   And they were HOT.  And I love spicy.  But holy moly my eyes were watering.   Still I persevered.   And guess what?  6 hours later I was in full blown labor.  So thank you India Gate for saving me from having to be induced!"}
{"text":"Trying out for first time. All is going great!! Real home style indian cooking. They grow some of their own vegetables!!  Goat and lamb are locally raised. Punjabi style saag was awesome. The Chicken Mughlai was different but really good. Service was extremely friendly. The owners, whose mom and dad are the cooks, engage into conversations with their guests. Wow!  What a concept. Ha ha. Finally, after two years of living in the Valley, we can solidly say we have found authentic, fresh Punjabi/Indian cooking."}
{"text":"Food is so good, service is great and price is really good. Spent $8 to fill up a to go container and got fresh garlic naan with it. If your in Chandler and looking for a great lunch spot, check this place out!"}
{"text":"I visit this place once a week on average for the lunch buffet as it is close to my work location. It offers a great experience at an affordable price.   Food: I really like the food, it's not too spicy and resembles home made Indian food to some extent. The have a decent selection of veg and non-veg curries. I also like the naan here, it's much better than most other Indian restaurants I've been to where they make it too thick and don't bake it properly.     Service: The service is really good and everyone here is very friendly and welcoming to the customers  Ambience: Again, no disappointments here. Its a good place to visit with a group and have a fun time."}
{"text":"We followed the 5 star Yelp rating and were not let down. Our server was extremely friendly and walked us through the menu.  We are new vegans and he helped us create a delicious and filling meal.  My wife and I are chili heads and ordered our food \"hot\".  I would say that it was about a 5 on our scale.  To the average person it would have been closer to an 8.  The portion of food to its cost is in line and it is made fresh (good value).  The restaurant is in a tired complex but the interior is new and fresh.  We are for sure going back!"}
{"text":"The food is different from other Indian restaurant. Serving size for the entree is less for the amount. We ordered 6 different entrees and sadly only 1 was tasty. The place is clean, service was nice."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant! Excellent service and food! I've tried their buffet and items from the menu, everything is delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service at a reasonable price. We really enjoyed it and are looking forward to returning"}
{"text":"I love this place so much we had our rehearsal dinner here! If you are considering an event, it is INCREDIBLY affordable and they are super accommodating and communicative.   The buffet is my husband and my fav. We did it 3x a week back in the day. My work schedule changed so we can't come as much but we would! It's always better during the week (and cheaper too) so just come then!   Dinner is harder to justify for us because it's a little pricer than our usual go-tos. Still worth it if you want the best Indian in the valley ?"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. I had Chicken tikka masala, some garlic naan, and vegetable samosas. I also had the mango lassi. It was all delicious. They were the best chicken tikka masala and mango lassi I've had so far. They say everything is made in house including the lassi and bread. The staff is friendly, and the place is clean. I will absolutely come back to try their lunch buffet. If you like Indian food, eat here."}
{"text":"The service here is amazing and the food is just as great! Their curry and tiki Marsala is amazing."}
{"text":"The waiter was an old, short balding Indian man that farted, scratched his nuts and picked his nose. Food was nothing special. Not that friendly and ignored by owners."}
{"text":"Went back today for another excellent lunch! The staff could not be any friendlier, and its such   a bargain for great food that I wish they would move to Maricopa!   Outstanding dishes today were: Keema Matter (Ground Beef w/ Green Peas), Chicken Tikka Masala, Tandoori Chicken, Veg. Biryani, and Garlic Naan"}
{"text":"Favorite Indian in the area. Been several times, always a fantastic meal. Service and food are amazing!"}
{"text":"Everything here is fantastic (the tikka masala is my favorite)! The wait staff is happy to answer any of your questions and they're extremely personable. This is definitely my go to spot to grab something different to eat."}
{"text":"I was referred to New India Gate by Steven at Simply Natural Nails in the same plaza. My husband and I came for lunch.  The guy that greeted us was very welcoming and very nice.  He pointed out all of the vegan options and even had the naan prepared without butter. The food was very good at a very reasonable price.  We would definitely come back when we are in town."}
{"text":"Was very excited to pick up a to go order on my way north from my office in Chandler.  After reading all the reviews I was really looking forward to trying a selection of dishes.  The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated - it wasn't busy, but I was there early.  When I arrived, my to go order wasn't quite ready and they invited me to have some water and to try some of the snacks at the buffet bar.  I can't remember the name, but one was like the papadam bread I have had in other indian restaurants, but I think they are called something else here.  Also the little dessert doughnut type balls in syrup - so good!  I really appreciated that they made me feel welcome - that counts for so much!  We ordered the tandoori chicken, the chicken makhni, aloo gobhi and the bengan bharta along with some naan breads.  Everything was great! We ordered it \"medium\" spicy and while the bengan bharta was pretty spicy the others came out pretty mild - will kick it up next time.  Portions were good sized - definitely enough for dinner plus a couple meals afterwards.    My only complaint: I did wish we got some raita, green sauce and chutney as side condiments though.  I am used to getting small portions of those along with your to go order without having to ask or pay extra."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Delicious!!! Friendly owners!! Deliciously tasteful food!! We are not new to the flavors of India, and I would rank the flavors excellent compared to most. We are going back!! Scorpion King Exterminating, LLC"}
{"text":"Okay, so this is my 3rd time being here and I must say it's a win every time. The food is absolutely amazing and delicious, and the garlic nan is my favorite. Let's not forget the great customer service I receive every time. I greatly appreciate a good place to eat but most importantly being taken care of. Highly recommend for its quality and price."}
{"text":"Great Indian food at an even better price. Great for take out or dine in. The service is always stellar, friendly servers with good suggestions. The place is also super clean."}
{"text":"This is an awesome Indian restaurant, I was greeted very well and the menu was explained to me as it was my first visit, I'm British and we have a lot of Indian food there and this gets a 10/10 from me, hope you enjoy as much as I did. \"O\" and the prices are great too."}
{"text":"The food was good and service was great. We had the lamb and  eggplant dish. The lamb was excellent although we did not like the eggplant.  Friendly atmosphere"}
{"text":"The food and service here is excellent. We have eaten here 3 times and not disappointed. Love the chicken Tika masala and korma. Restaurant itself is 4 star food and service has been 4.5."}
{"text":"Went here by accident.  Excellent service and dishes. Server made suggestions based on our preferences."}
{"text":"My automatic go to for Indian food. The selection, quality, and preparation of our food was exceptional. The service put the experience over the top! I have been here now several times and they never fail to impress. The weekend buffet has a great selection and I have never seen it not stocked. Nothing worse than waiting for your favorite. This has never happened.  The buffet is really good but I enjoy even more trying different dishes from the menu.  Always greeted warmly when I arrive like meeting an old friend.  Great job! See you soon"}
{"text":"Meh. Bhajias were more flour then vegetables. The paneer curry was less thicker than ideal. Naan was decent. Service was good. The chap taking the order was personable and doing a good job"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the lunch buffet on a Friday afternoon.  Yes the place was full but you would never know it. Food was great, plates were cleared fast and drinks were refilled instantly. The buffet was fully stocked and restocked when a tray became low. The staff was so attentive... they are raising the bar in the area.   This place is great, don't hesitate. Go now!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian Food I've had! So good & tastes authentic. They can make your dish according to how spicy you want it as well I got the Chicken Tikka Masala & lamb tandoori.  Everything had lots of flavor. Naan was cooked until it was fluffy and not burnt."}
{"text":"This restaurant is simply the best Indian restaurant in the valley. It has the authentic taste of India, as well as their food materials and sauces. As an Asian, I noticed that their food is much healthier than other Indian restaurants. I particularly love their lamb curry in the buffet. I also love their garlic naan. Their dessert is also very yummy."}
{"text":"Best Indian food around hands down. The service is amazing and so friendly and accommodating. I've been to Mumbai and have to say the food compares to some of the best restaurants in Mumbai. I will be a regular here. This is a must try place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. Very charming and attentive staff. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"New India Gate is such a lovely restaurant. All of the staff is super friendly.  My boyfriend and I really enjoy going there for the food as well as the service. I feel that the pricing is also very reasonable in comparison in to other places in town that don't have this type of service. I recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure which was better - the food or the service.  Lunch buffet was excellent and they are just the most friendliest people you'll ever meet.  Very excited to come back."}
{"text":"Great place in a great location with plenty of parking and easy access.  We were greeted by friendly staff with great knowledge of the menu and components of each dish.  The aloo pratha is amazing along with the cracker-type bread, papadum.  The chicken tikka masala was amazing along with the lamb korma, which we ordered extra spicy.  We will come again or grab some take out as we love great Indian food!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very spacious and has a pleasant environment. The food was so delicious that our kids also finished everything we ordered (which doesn't happen when we eat at a restaurant) Service was excellent too. Would definitely recommend New India gate to my friends."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service. We had the chicken tikka masala and lamb korma. Prepared perfectly. I highly recommend! Will come back every time I'm in Chandler!"}
{"text":"My friends been raving about this restaurant so I tagged along with them for dinner. Everything in the restaurant is new and clean. This place is run by two brothers and their dad is the chef. Only one of the brothers were there and he was very attentive and I liked that he engaged in conversation with us. Granted my friends are regulars here and the owners know them,  Golbi introduced himself & was very friendly. I started off with the vegetable samosa which was delicious. It comes with two sauces (Tamarind & mint chutney). the green sauce reminds me of a green chili salsa and the red one is sweet & tangy. Both compliment the samosas very well. Then I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo and asked for Indian Hot since I love spicy food. I ordered a side of rice with my dish or you can order a side of the garlic naan that is just as good. If you got an appetite then get both :)  Overall  the food was delicious, service was great and it's a great new addition to the Chandler area. The owner also is working on getting his alcohol license so expect to see some great beer selection coming soon!"}
{"text":"Loved our first time here - delicious, and I believe, authentic. The Chicken Tikka Marsala was outstanding and the Beef Curry was sooo good! The meat so tender too. We went 'hot' but it wasn't overpowering."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful evening with my wife. This restaurant sure did pass the Indian/Punjabi litmus test. We ordered saag(cooked mustard leaves) and onion kulcha(stuffed bread with onion, potatoes). Both these dishes were completely amazing! The saag was perfect and reminiscent of the authentic way it is prepared back at home. No extra cream or oil was added and had a subtle blend of spices. Similarly, the kulcha was original without any frills. We also ordered pistachio kulfi. It's basically a semi-solid frozen dessert which gave us both the final aa-ha moment!  As a sidekick they also serve Indian beers which, are 8% alcohol with 650ml volume, twice as effective as American beers. In case anyone is up for a trip!  Service was great, everyone is attentive and takes good care of you. I also heard some good Punjabi music. They, definitely deserve a five star."}
{"text":"I love this place! I am pretty new to Indian food and have been trying places all over town, this one is the best by far. They have a really great lunch special that is 8.95 and you get all the favorites and some new ones too! I will certainly be a repeat customer for as long as I live here."}
{"text":"We just love going for lunch here. The food is amazing and perfect place to grab lunch buffet during office time. So glad they opened it here."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for the lunch buffet, today. The buffet was hot and well stocked, with a dozen main dishes, plus salads and sweets.   My wife had paneer tika masala (very tasty), saag planner (really good, flavorful and spicy), and daal maharani (very good). I had the chicken curry (nicely spicy with big pieces of chicken), tandoori chicken (perfectly cooked, moist, and yummy), and chicken dum biryani (medium spicy and very tasty).   We talked with both father and son, co-owners, that opened this spot just three weeks ago. They are very friendly and attentive to the guests, even when it is just the buffet."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the lunch buffet. It is impressive.  Two types of chicken in sauces, chicken tandoori. One ground beef dish. Two veggie dishes in sauce and two sauces that is for meat eaters and veggie eaters.  The spices are good. In fact I cannot decide what tastes better. I also like that we can't at the end of the buffet and they are still making fresh food.  That's important.   The pictures below. The mess on the counter at the chicken curry is my fault.  It's a new fresh mess    This is good.  This is tasty.  This place is great.   Really nice service too.  (Nice to look at too)"}
{"text":"Never had Indian food and this was my first try. I have nothing to compare it to but I thought it was really good. My fiancé who has had it in India said it's the best around. Service was also great. We will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing. Delicious. Exceptional service! The guys that work here are super nice and the food is so good."}
{"text":"Drop by one day after a recommendation.  Place was close after lunch but owner/staff offered to help ourselves and taste some of the food left at the lunch buffet spread.   That's just a brilliant service! Came back one evening wt a group of friends for dinner.  Didn't get disappointed.  Great food.  Friendly service and we will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here regularly for lunch. The food is awesome and the service is even better. The guys are friendly and they hustle! Don't skip the chai tea on the counter!"}
{"text":"We loved the food and service at India Gate on Kyrene. It was not only the best but also the closest to us! How disappointed we were when we drove up for another great meal only to find it was closed! And, now, how thrilled we are to find they've reopened - and in a location equally close to us. We can now resume our regularly scheduled trips for the very best Indian cuisine in the Valley! Thoroughly enjoyed buffet lunch today. Many thanks to Gopi for his hospitality and for explaining all the exciting plans he and family have for their new restaurant. A true family endeavor, with brothers running the front and their father the chef cooking all of the amazing dishes. We can't wait to come back again and again!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for takeout, once for sit down. I was very pleased both times. The second time I went with my wife and she loved it too. The food was top notch, especially the lamb boti masala. The service was excellent and very friendly.  They made great recommendations for menu items and had our food out in good time. The atmosphere is great for either casual dining or for date night."}
{"text":"New India Gate is one of the best spots for some Indian food.  They have a wide variety of options and have such kind staff.  The staff are always willing to answer your questions and are open to genuine conversations about life.  This is my third time here and I look forward to coming again when I can!  !"}
{"text":"The food was okaish in the bufet. Some things were good but definitely not worth a 5 star experience. Mango Lassi n curry was good. Deserts kinda disappointed me! Pakoras n chutney was great!  Food was worth the price, just made it in!"}
{"text":"We have ordered several times, the food is Always amazing!  Love that they offer delivery! The guy that answers the phone and does the delivery is always so friendly!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's our new old standby. Great food, great service! Love the tandoori!  Haven't tried the buffet yet but looks delicious."}
{"text":"Outstanding service! The food is slowly home cooked so you may have to wait just a little bit. The food is so delicious it is well worth the wait. This is the best Indian food in town!"}
{"text":"GO HERE!!!! My husband, cousin and I stopped here memorial weekend after a Looong drive back from California... we were delayed about an hour and a half cause of car accident after car accident! All we wanted was a warm delicious meal before getting home!  The service will not disappoint, the food will not disappoint.. if you're looking for disappointment, do not come here!!  It's only been about a week since visiting and I'm already planning my trip back!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times for lunch. Very good buffet with lots of variety. Even for me as a vegetarian. Service is friendly and fast. Will try dinner next."}
{"text":"Best restaurant experience in a very long time!  Super friendly staff and great food!  We had tikka masala and naan bread - the grand kids also loved their food."}
{"text":"This place has amazing customer service! The guys there were very welcoming and attentive! They were on top of their game and did a great job making me feel welcome. I came here for dinner, and their dinner menu is pretty large. It is organized by type of meat or veggies, etc. The food itself was delicious, decent portion sizes for a decent price. The restaurant is very open and has plenty of seating."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Best Indian food I've ever had! Servers were attentive, kind, and welcoming. The menu has lots of options and the mango lassi and chicken tikka were superb! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. We were impressed with how helpful our waiter was and with the flavor of the food. The garlic naan was tasty."}
{"text":"We were here for the lunch buffet. The food was delicious and had a terrific variety.  Complements for the cleanliness and appearance of the dining room. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"I eat at this restaurant all the time. I have tried many other local Indian food restaurants, but this one is by far my favorite. I get the Malai Kofta every time. It is always amazing. My boyfriend has tried many of the items on the menu and has loved all of them. The service is also fantastic. We are greeted like old friends every time we go into the restaurant. The server always remembers us and asks us how we're doing. I've also ordered from them through Grub Hub and their food travels really well. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Indian food!"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious!  Especially loved the Chicken Tiki Masala and the Biryani.  So, so good.  Went here with a party of 4 for a friends birthday and boy did the waiter (who I think may be owner) was so funny and helpful with ordering and did not make us feel dumb when we were unfamiliar with the cuisine.  He actually brought us samples of things we didn't order just so we could try them. We got medium spiciness on our items and I would consider it a fairly mild medium compared to most curry type food I've had.   Fabulous experience!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Fast and great service. Never had to worry about running out of anything. Family oriented. Good price. Chicken Tikka Masala was amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and I like their chicken tikka masala and their chicken curry."}
{"text":"So good! The tamarind and mint chutneys that came with the appetizer were delicious, full of flavor. Our garlic naan wasn't greasy and was perfectly balanced as to not overpower our food. I had the chicken vindaloo, which I will gladly eat again. My boyfriend had the chicken saag, also delicious, smooth and creamy.   The service was great too. We sat next to what seemed like a difficult table and the server/owner handled them with such grace offering suggestions and detailed explanations. He even looked at another restaurant's menu that the customer pulled up to show her what would be similar on his menu. He was very friendly to us as well. I wish them much success and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is an amazing, family-run restaurant serving amazing home style Indian food. The menu is extensive and delicious. We had Chicken Madras, Shrimp Korma and Chicken Tika Masala served family style. Even better, the service was excellent. Definitely come here and enjoy a great meal and meet the brothers who own the place."}
{"text":"The \"New India Grill\" is great place. Food is top notch, the staff is very knowledgeable about the menu. My son ordered the curry chicken and did not want to hear that the CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA.  Good thing I choose the  CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA. Because my son decided to take the CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA from me.  The ONION KULCHA has just the right amount of onions. The bread is light and fluffy."}
{"text":"Really good Indian food and awesome service. They were recently tagged as the best buffet in Arizona also. I would recommend going here!"}
{"text":"We have been to New India Gate multiple times, and each experience was wonderful. The food is delicious and the staff is friendly. The chicken tikka masala is easily the best I have ever had, and it's great to see goat and lamb options. We will be back over and over again!"}
{"text":"Hello new favorite Indian food restaurant! Yum. Ordered take out here during lunch. Young man answering the phone (owner?) was really polite and helpful. Came to pickup the order and found a large, clean, busy restaurant. All of the employees were super nice. I did have a bit of a long wait for the order but people kept checking on me and I didn't really mind waiting. The food was really tasty! You can specify the spice level, which I appreciated. I had medium spice, which was just right for someone who is kind of a spice wimp but still wants a little kick. The naan was delicious, as was the saag paneer.  Will definitely be back for the customer service, cleanliness, and delicious food! Might just dine in next time with the takeout wait time though ..."}
{"text":"The first thing you notice at NEW India Gate is not only the new location, but everything is literally new.  New plates, utensils, chairs, tables, menus.  You name it and it is new. Two knowledgable and loquacious brothers run the place.  They seat, take orders, bus tables, serve the food and answer every question about the eclectic menu that is thrown at them. The recipes, however, are the fathers.   We decided to sample menu items other than the ubiquitous chicken tikka masala. We started of with the beef samosas. I had never seen the beef variety before.  All I can say is \"WOW!\"  Served with mint and tamarin chutney, the     delicately spiced ground beef was seasoned perfectly.  I would have  been satisfied to end the meal right then and there.     Next was the Fish Pakora, they were tasty and made with moist white fish.  Nothing mind blowing.  For the main meals we ordered \"Indian Hot\" spice level.   We ordered: Mushroom Matter (mushroom, tomato, green peas and spices),  Chana Masala (garbanzo beans and masala sauce), and Karahi Shrimp (ginger, tomoto, onion, bell pepper served in an Indian copper pan). I was craving super hot but I would equate it to a medium at a Thai restaurant.  The food paired really well with the fresh soft garlic naan.  I am definitely returning and bringing friends!"}
{"text":"As a huge fan of Indian buffets for over the last twenty two years, I've tried quite a few in the east valley, and in that time, I long considered Delhi Palace over in Tempe as the gold standard.  After multiple trips to New India Gate, they have officially taken the crown away from Delhi Palace as my all-time favorite!  The buffet is fully packed with tasty offerings which, once the craving hits, has me coming back just about every couple of weeks.  At $9.95 for the weekend buffet, I truly feel that for the quality and quantity of food that they offer, you get more than your moneys worth.  The Chicken Tikka Masala is absolutely scrumptious every single time that I visit this establishment, along with the Tandori Chicken, tender and juicy with just the right amount of spice to it, the Vegetable Samosas, a crispy, flaky pastry filled with spiced up potatoes and veggies, and their rice as the base, which is cooked to perfection every time I visit.  The garlic naan has just the right amount texture and flavor to sop up alll of those incredible sauces on your plate to create the perfect bite.  These are just a few of the many delicious choices that keep me coming back for more!  Lastly, the dessert selection is the perfect finishing acts to send your taste buds into the stratosphere.  The Kheer is without a doubt, the best version of rice pudding that I've ever had.  That along with the Golab Jaman, little balls of milky goodness, various spices and sugar syrup just add to the symphony of flavors that this fine place offers.  Finally, the Gajar Halwa, their take on a sweet carrot dessert, which includes nuts and raisins, is just another home run that makes my mouth water just thinking about it!  Bottom line - if you've never gone outside the box and experimented with this type of food, the buffet at New India Gate is the perfect place to give your taste buds something new that they'll thank you for later.  If you've already tried out Indian food and are a fan of this type of cuisine, come to this place and see what all of the terrific reviews are about!  The family which owns the place truly show their love for the food that they're putting out for the masses and are extremely generous and personable.  Keep up the high standard that you've already set New India Gate, it's certainly working on yours truly!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience. The restaurant is newly opened with food made from family recipes. The two brothers who are owners were very gracious. They shared a lot of information with us about the food and how it was cooked. The decor was lovely and inviting. We highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Me: We need to yelp the shit out of this place.   Craig: Oh yeah.   Me: So I think what sets this place apart from other good Indian restaurants is the service. At a couple of other places where the food is good, the service has been indifferent or even surly. But here they seem genuinely happy to see you and super friendly and funny.   Craig: That's true. I agree. And the food is also excellent. I haven't had a bad dish.   Me: Yes! The food has been amazing every time. And we've been here three times each, twice together. Some places are hit or miss, but this place is consistently good.   Craig: The standout favorite is the chicken tikka masala. But the garlic naan is also naan-stop.   Me: I'm not typing that. Pick another adjective.   Craig:  Me: Fine. *rolls eyes* The beef samosas were good. I like their papadam and tamarind sauce. And we've had the aloo ghobi and aloo matar, which were both very tasty.   Craig: I'd order any of that again, but there are so many options I'd like to try out some other items.   Me: I also like the airy, spacious feeling of the restaurant. And I like the shiny wall. It's definitely not super decorated, but it's nice and feels neat and clean.   Craig: Yeah, clean and modern. And the music is nice in the background. It's there, but it's not oppressive.   Me: This place isn't busy on weeknights. Frankly, it should be much busier, but I kind of love that I don't have to wait. And I love that they never close. Like ever. Sunday, Monday, holidays, zombie apocalypse. Whatever. They're open.   Craig: I feel like we skimmed over the service too quickly. They've earned more screen time.   Me: Definitely! They'll give you honest opinions about what's best on your menu. Your drink will never have a chance to get below the halfway mark. But they never feel like they're crowding you.   Craig: I think you've covered it.  Me: We never talked about the stars.   Craig: It was a given maybe.   Me: Yeah, five stars for service and food. Four and a half stars on the decor."}
{"text":"After trying a few places in the area, I think I have finally found my Indian food \"go-to\"! After looking at reviews on yelp, I found this restaurant and called in an order on my way home. I ordered the chicken tikka masala (medium spice), basmati rice, and plain naan. It was delightful! I always over estimate the amount of spice I like in my Indian food, so I may order the spice level lower next time, but that's on me. The amount of food you get for the price is good, even without the 20% discount right now. I am new to the area, and from what I understand the owners had a restaurant before and have recently moved to this location on Ray, but you can tell they have been in the business quite a while from their warm welcome when I arrived to their flawless execution of my dish and the dishes I saw when there. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was good. Not spicy enough for me, but I was being considerate of my dining friends.  It was cooked well, the vegetables being a little crunchy, the way I like them.  They quantity of food was such that we had to order multiple dishes, but that was OK because we got to taste several items. It did add to the price, though."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. We have been here twice now and it's fresh and yummy. They will Add and subtract any ingredients you want which helps to make the perfect choice. Love Indian food but this will now be our go to for Indian. Owners and staff are also very nice."}
{"text":"To get straight to the point, I've eaten at maybe a dozen different Indian restaurants around Phoenix (usually take-out for dinner), and I've found this to be my overall favorite. It's hard to explain exactly why, but I simply prefer the flavors/spices here better than the other places. The only thing I don't like is that it is a bit on the pricey side (for dinner) and the portions are somewhat smaller than many of the other restaurants. Nevertheless, I usually end up making the trek out here from downtown whenever we're in the mood for Indian food."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Very good service n place.. the food is not excessively spicy but it was made very well considering the fact that it should have Indian touch.. would always recommend this place .."}
{"text":"Always a pleasant experience coming here. Standard fare for the buffet: tikka masala, chicken curry, goat curry, paneer, samosas. Sorry. We still have yet to order from the menu. My sister's and I love coming for their tasty food & fantastic service. I would love to give extra stars in my rating. Everyone is very friendly & pleasant. Good customer service does not need to come with an expensive bill. Fancy is not always the best."}
{"text":"Yelp once again lead us to this great Indian food restaurant. The people who served us worked as a team; they were very welcoming and friendly. Our Food was delicious, chicken tiki masala and shrimp korma, which can both be made with coconut milk to avoid the dairy. Our waiters kept bringing water and it didn't  take long at all for any of the food.  It was a great dining experience and the food couldn't have been better.  Try this place once and like us, you're going to want to go back."}
{"text":"finally try this restaurant and it is worth recommending!  We order lamb korma and shrimp curry, they both are very good but I think I like the korma better. They are perfect match with garlic nanns  In terms of spicy level from 1 to 10, we have tried 6 this time, but we wanna try higher next time as we both are big fun of spicy food."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place has so many stars. We went for a buffet lunch, as we entered we were seated and asked if we wanted a regular or a garlic naan. We chose mix of both naan.   The options were very few compared to the other Indian buffet lunch places we have been to. The lamb/ goat curry was tasteless. The Biryani, we have to rename for this place. Most of the food was missing the authentic Indian flavor. Everything was too bland and had absolutely no taste. My stars go for the ambience, its clean and for the garlic naan, chicken tikka masala. I hardly had rest of the food, the chicken tandoori was the worst.   It was my first experience and I am never coming back again. The price is really not worth for the food they serve here. Please save yourself from this place."}
{"text":"Really nice people with amazingly consistent service and food. Everything is just delicious and satisfies the soul."}
{"text":"I found New India Gate through a Yelp search. I was impressed by all the good reviews and decided I had to try it. My husband and I went last night on our date night. The restaurant is clean and modern looking. We were greeted by one of the owners (it's owned by 2 brothers).  The brothers were so personable and fun. They make you feel like you're an old friend and were always available for drink refills or for extra mint chutney!  We ordered a variety of food. We started with the vegetable snack plate that had a variety of deep fried yummy snacks. Very good and nicely seasoned. The goat curry is delicious. The goat meat is so tender and the sauce is yummy. We ordered the basmati rice which was light and fluffy. The shrimp korma.... I will sing the praises of this dish! The shrimp were fork tender and the gravy is the ultimate comfort food! Order the garlic naan so you can soak up all the goodness with it!  We were given a sample of the sweet mango lassi. It was thick and creamy. I could have downed a gallon of the stuff easy!  We opted for some dessert to round out our meal. We ordered the gulab jamun and the pistachio kulfi. The gulab jamun was good. A little more dense than I like. But the kulfi.... wow! It was so delicious! You HAVE to try it! We will definitely be back to try more of their food!"}
{"text":"We are so happy to find this fabulous Indian restaurant. After moving from Tucson to Maricopa, we tried one Indian restaurant in Phoenix that had great reviews, but were so disappointed that we did not try another. This place had so many excellent reviews that we decided to take a chance and we were not disappointed.   The food is excellent. The service is fantastic. The actual restaurant is spotlessly clean and welcoming. We will be going back on a regular basis. Try it! :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I've never tried Indian food before but can't wait to go back.. the buffet was fresh and was worth every penny! The staff was super inviting and made you feel comfortable always checking on you. Everything was clean and all the spices smelled amazing! Must try the garlic naan!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this restaurant. I love Indian food, and this establishment was a huge disappointment. The only thing that was half decent was the lamb korma. There are so many great Indian restaurants in the valley, do not waste your money at this one. The food tastes spicy yet bland. Also, it did not taste fresh either."}
{"text":"Better meat than most buffets I've had in the valley. Pretty new place, but the owners were previously owners of a different restaurant that was sold so seem to have the mixture and admin down right. Very nice people and good service. My favorite on the buffet was the goat---which is usually difficult to find. They did a good job and didn't skimp on the meat."}
{"text":"Ordered first time from this place a to-go order of chicken reshmi kabab, goat curry, naan and samosa. Disappointed with this place too, samosas were soggy and not freshly done, naan too seemed totally unfresh, definitely not going back there. Search for a decent indian restaurant continues!"}
{"text":"Been years since we found a good Indian restaurant in Phoenix.  Tried a bunch and just couldn't find the authentic flavor we enjoyed at our neighborhood Indian restaurant in California.    Then found this one on yelp with great reviews.  Just enjoyed New India Gate for the second time and sooo happy!   Excellent, fresh flavors.   Perfect chicken Tikka masala and chicken Tikka.  Just like the one in California.  Great service, personable brothers who run it and attentive staff.   If you like Indian food you HAVE to try this place."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant I have visited till now in Arizona. Ordered goat achari  with butter naan and surprisingly it was served just with in 10 mins. Excellent taste. Just like home made. Will go again soon. Family managed restaurant with good attitude and customer friendly nature."}
{"text":"The family that owns this place used to own Royal Taj about 20+ years ago.  Let me just say the food is amazing as always.  Theirs is the only Indian lunch buffet I'll go to.  It's all so yummy and I've gotten to experience some new Indian foods I'd never had before. Recommend: Chicken Curry Chicken Tikka Masala Kafta  Also on their buffet last time they had these 2 amazing deserts.  An Indian 'fudge' that reminded me of homemade Scottish shortbread and deep fried flour bits tossed in syrup. Both soon good and excellent ways to end a meal there."}
{"text":"Very good lunch buffet! Garlic naan is amazing, the goat curry is a highlight. Although the selection is not a lot, the food are very well prepared. A nice chai to end the meal ."}
{"text":"Best Indian food! We truly enjoyed our visit here this evening. Went here on a google search for Indian food in our area. We order the same things at all Indian restaurants because we know what we like but these entrees surpassed our expectations. We ordered the Saag Paneer, Chicken Korma, Lamb Tiki Masala, Mango Lassi, Garlic Nann, and Rice Pudding. The flavors were so rich, everything came out perfect temp, and the customer service made our experience. I don't have one bad thing to say, we loved it and will be back one day!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food in town. Everything is home made so they can accomodate allergies. The lamb korma was nice and zesty, had the 2nd hottest and the spice did not overpower the flavors. Bread was to die for and rice was great as always. Service stands out the most from my visit, they are attentive and personable. Perfect score for an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Always a good go to when we visit on the east side.  Lunch buffet has an amazing variety.  I can't stop eating since the food is so good.  Only had time to take a pic of vegetable pekora (think that's how you spell it).  New India Gate is definitely the gateway to Indian cuisine!!"}
{"text":"My sister was visiting from California and we were looking for a good Indian restaurant.  We found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  We walked in 15 minutes before the restaurant actually opened.  We warmly welcomed and seated promptly.  A young gentleman quickly came over and welcomed us again.  He took our drink order and offered nan bread with our choice of flavor.  A few minutes later we were told the buffet was ready and we were invited to serve ourselves.  Everything in the buffet looked freshly prepared.  We sat down with our plate and upon our first bite we were hooked.  The food is delicious and the customer service is beyond great.  The two brothers who run this restaurant are constantly aware of customers needs and always willing to answer any questions about the food.  We will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"Truly fantastic food, home made ice cream, perfect seasoning,  food came out very fast, and the staff very friendly,  definitely one of top Indian restaurant in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"First time eating Indian food and i was not disappointed.  For the first timer i recommend Chicken Tikka masala"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant in the valley. Not only is the food fantastic, but the two brothers that manage this place provide some of the best customer service you can ever experience at a restaurant. My favorites include the chicken tikka masala and their baked carrot desert (I've never seen it anywhere else). The mango lassi is also very good. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here when we realized that one of our other favorite Indian food restaurants was closed on Mondays and I'm happy we did! We had the lunch buffet which was, first off, super cheap!  Now for the food- the food was good. It was not the best Indian food I've had in Phoenix for sure. Even among buffets it is not the best. They gave us a choice of garlic or regular naan. We went for the garlic naan and it was awesome. I really enjoyed the tandoori chicken and this beef and pea thing (I have absolutely no idea what it was called). Other things that I typically enjoy and are standard for Indian buffets-- butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, and saag paneer were all average. If there dinner food tasted like that, I probably wouldn't order anything listed above. The dessert here was also pretty good but standard. They had rice kheer and Gulab jamun.   The food was a solid three stars and honestly good for $7.99. I hope they work on improving the depth of flavor that is usually found in Indian food.   The restaurant itself also gets 3 stars. It was super clean which is awesome, but on the day we were there their AC must have been broken or really high- definitely not something you want in an AZ summer.  Aside from price, the reason this place gets 4 stars and not 3 is that the service is stellar. Our waiter was awesome and genuinely cared about our meal. The manager (I think) also came by and you could tell that he genuinely cared about the restaurant. I definitely see a lot of potential for this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Both my grandma and I visited this restaurant for the first time today. As soon as we walked through the door we were greeted with smiles. My grandma has never eaten Indian food so she had a lot of questions. The brothers were very kind and eager to answer every question. We ordered the Beef Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka Masala, 1 garlic naan, one regular naan (to go) a side order of rice and a mango lassi. Yes we ordered alot but we just wanted to try the food. Everything was scrumptious. One of the brothers was super nice and talkative. They truly do care about their customers. The ambiance of the restaurant was very relaxing. Overall my grandma and I loved everything. From the moment of us walking in until we left we had great service and delicious food. If you haven't been here before I would highly recommend that you give them a try! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Based on their reviews, we had to give it a try. It is quite difficult to find a good Indian place for lunch. Especially when you want to eat an all you can eat buffet.  New India Gate is the perfect place to do so! Nested in a shopping mall, the outside of the building is not very welcoming. However as soon as you step foot into the restaurant, the staff greets you and shows you to your table. Our waiter was very polite and very friendly, we were asked if we wanted plain or garlic bread. Of course we took the garlic one!  There is no menu at the table since it's a lunch buffet, we waited to get our sodas then we decided to jump in! There is a wide variety of choices from a spinach dish (one of my favorite by the way) to tandoori chicken. Even if you are vegetarian, you will find something delicious to eat.  Every employee that came to our table were very nice, we weren't rushed to finish our plates or anything. You actually have to go to the counter/bar to pay, which is totally fine. The lunch buffet is $7.99, seriously!  If we ever crave for Indian food for lunch, I know where I'm going!"}
{"text":"Its my first visit to the restaurant. Its clean and the owners are friendly. I went with Buffet at Saturday. It was $8.99. Lets talk about the food. The foods hahave a homemade taste. Not a lot of options but hey if the food is good then it does not matter. All of the dishes had a very good taste. A place worth trying. Definitey will come again.:)"}
{"text":"We ordered Chicken Kabab , if I have to rate that out of 5 ~ I will give it 2.5 .  We got the bread first and then we got the rest , and the wait time is higher.  Food was average, nothing bad and nothing great.  We took , Paneer tikka , dal and goat masala and my daughter ordered the poori   Service is slow ~ keep that in mind !!  Worst was I found a hair in my goat , server was happy to get me a new one but I was almost done but he got me a togo."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant has excellent customer service and delicious food.  The friendly staff alone were worth the visit. The food just sealed the deal."}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked for ages and finally went with a friend for a weekday lunch buffet. First off, it was clean and the people were super nice and inviting. We were seated immediately. It was around noon on a Tuesday, but there were only a couple of other people in the restaurant, which was a little odd.  The buffet had a great variety of typical Indian favorites, and a few not as well known dishes. The rice was well cooked, fragrant, and hot. The only real downfall is that the food lacked a bit of spice. I know that's typical with buffets because they want to tone it down a notch for the average person, but I feel like it was toned down too much. Even so, I really enjoyed it and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it.I was hungry,the place seemed nice and the service was pretty good. The food..not so much. The tandoori chicken was dry,the lamb and the paneer didnt really seem fresh. Even the tomatoes in the salad tasted stale. I may have gone on a bad day,but the place did not live up to the great reviews."}
{"text":"First time here last night.   Party of 8.  Service was good, friendly.   We ordered about 7 different dishes to share.  Food was just OK.  It has the heat,  but light on flavor.  A little pricey for the portion sizes, and they  are stingie with the protein.  The restaurant itself was clean and inviting, however the chairs are too tall for the tables."}
{"text":"I drive by 3 other Indian Food restaurants to eat here. Drop the mic! Food is fresh, fresh, fresh and delicious. The staff is quick and waits on you with precision and efficiency. An excellent value as well, because hot tea and garlic Naan is included!!"}
{"text":"This Indian food joint was recommended to me by a friend. This restaurant has been under new ownership for the past year. We came here just for take out. They have a casual but clean restaurant. They seemed to have a good lunch buffet going. We ordered the chicken biriyani and tandoori mixed platter. We got it Indian hot which was quite spicy so if be careful before you order it. We enjoy spicy food so we liked it.  The food was above average and better than a lot of the other AZ Indian joints. Being a big fan of Indian food I have a high standard for Indian food.  The meat was moist and not dried out. The biriyani was well spiced and had a good amount of meat in it. The mango lassi was really good.  Will probably come back again. Would like to try the lunch buffet some time."}
{"text":"In one word it was HORRIBLE experience !!   If u wanna eat tomato gravy in the name of panner butter masala and watery  palak panner then this place is best in entire America ...only good part was there staff otherwise it was worse then pathetic place to eat Indian food !!!"}
{"text":"This place is so good and reasonably priced. The service is excellent and food delish!"}
{"text":"AMAZING NAAN, oh my god. So good, also the mango lassi was better than a few places I've been.  The food was good, wish it was spicier though.  There was no mango custard that day which was a bummer."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Not only was the food delicious and fresh, but the staff were so friendly. Every single person was smiling and said hello to our table. We felt like we were invited into a family home for dinner rather than a run of the mill restaurant. The young man (owner's son) who was there told us all the ingredients are sourced fresh and locally, and that they are all family recipes. I hate when people say that and you can taste a disgusting frozen, month old mess. Not the case at all here; EVERYTHING was tried tasted like it was made on the spot. We had the chicken tika masala, lamb vindaloo, samosas, a delicious Indian beer (Kingfisher), and the best damn pistachio dessert I have ever had. I HIGHLY recommend giving this new joint a shot; I hope they stay in business for years to come."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new place out, and find out we have been to one of their previous establishments a few years back.  Same great food.  This time it seems like the Sons are running the show, so you get some great customer service and conversation, not always what you say about Indian Dining.    Had a bunch of stuff, took home some leftovers.  We had a goat dish (off menu) and some of the cauliflower (forgot the name of the vegetarian dish) and some tandoori chicken.  Chicken was very juicy, everything was great.    Will absolutely go back.  We were the last one there and were not rushed.  We don't like keeping people so we made it quick :)  Very clean and modern.  If anything like their other place the lunch buffet will be fantastic."}
{"text":"We were greeted with friendly staff and seated at a booth where the table settings were nicely set and clean. As soon as we were seated we received water and given the menus. Our waiter was friendly, offered suggestions, and explained what was being given such as the rice chips with dipping sauce. The food came out quickly and was delicious! We had the tikka masala, garlic naan, rice, and mango lassi. The chicken was tender and full of flavor and the lassi was just the right amount of sweetness with a bit of tartness to it. We will definitely be back for the friendly staff, nice atmosphere, and great food!"}
{"text":"We came in for the first time not knowing the anything about the menu. We were greeted since we walked in, he was very polite, and patient with us, explaining all the menu and ingredients. The food the the best, so tasteful and delicious. We are definitely coming back for dinner. The recipes and all the menu is home made from scratch. Wow"}
{"text":"Another visit to New India Gate, another delicious lunch buffet. This is definitely my go to spot for Indian food. Same great taste each and every time I visit. I highly recommend the Goat Curry."}
{"text":"If you are Indian don't go ... period!!!! Worst food in entire America!!!!  Paneer tikka felt like tomato gravy. Palak paneer was just horrible. We had buffet and would not recommend to any one. I just don't know how they have so many positive reviews.  Forgot to mention, the deserts were so bad that frozen deserts will be 1000 times better!!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 10 stars if I could. This was my second visit. The level of customer service is out of this world and food is always on point."}
{"text":"I've never had better Indian food in my life and the people who work here are beyond excellent! Over all of the times I have been here they have become more and more like family to me.  When it comes to the food, the blends of spices and flavors are exactly on point and balanced. The lamb is tender, the chicken is perfectly cooked, etc. If you are new to Indian food or have had previous bad experiences at other places, I recommend you give this place a try. They have the patience, knowledge, and food quality to make solid recommendations and give you the best possible experience."}
{"text":"First time trying Indian food, and I have to say this place was great. They were so helpful answering our questions and helping with recommendations. We will definitely be coming back again. Next time we'll try the lunch buffet to try a bunch of different dishes."}
{"text":"You know how a good restaurant gets elevated status because of great, friendly service? That's this place. I'm not one to turn down an invite for an Indian lunch buffet. Finding out that this little gem is close by, we're on our way. Totally nondescript surroundings outside and in. But that warm n fuzzy feeling of truly being welcomed hit before the front door shut behind us. I could do without the constant reminder of \"front door open\" with every entry/exit. We unfortunately chose the table right by that annoying little speaker.  I've got a tool that can quickly put an end to that. It's spotless clean & didn't smell like feet, as curry can sneak up on you like that. The tables are dressed with nice linens. The few selections were typical and our choice of nan was given and brought warm & fresh quickly. We tried everything and it was all mmmmm tasty. A little mango chutney would've been good but I managed to inhale 2.5 plates.  But these guys running this place are genuinely friendly, helpful and deserving of a fat tip.  All in all, in my top 5 restaurants when I want to get my Indian fix"}
{"text":"I have a new favorite lunch spot. Wow the food was fantastic. I sampled almost everything on the lunch buffet and my taste buds are dancing. The goat was sumptuous and the tandoori chicken is as good as I have had anywhere. There is also plenty to love if you are vegitarian too with a nice array of vegetable dishes spiced to perfection. Not over priced or over spiced. Lunch buffet is $7.99 (currently on special for $6.99). I'll be a regular here."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in AZ.  Really good.  Super friendly staff, family own and run.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is always so inviting and friendly.  The service is amazing.  My drink was never half full before it was filled. The naan was always refilled. Plates cleared right away. The buffet is so delicious and has a great meat and vegetarian selection. The best chicken tikka masala I've ever had.  My husband loves the desserts. They have rice pudding and the heavenly doughnut like balls. There is even chai included in the buffet and it's so inexpensive for such a huge selection, $7.99 lunch buffet.  They have everything from two types of rice, entrees, salad, samosas, and dessert.  Definitely our new favorite Indian place.  They have goat and lamb on the weekends!!  It's family owned and operated."}
{"text":"This Review is for Buffet Only  Very disappointed with the Lunch buffet. The quality has deteriorated since my last visit. I have been impressed with their food but this was nothing close to what they used to offer.  The buffet is priced at $9.95 on weekends. The spread was average no appetizers  Chicken biriyani was in a sorry state, curries were just Okay. Dishes were not being refilled.  Garlic naan was brought to the table which was great other items like basmati rice, custard and Kheer were fresh. Gulab jamun was outright bad  We barely touched our food.  Not going back for the buffet. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and expect to keep coming back.  Both times, I've gone just as the doors were opened to avoid the rush.  Compared to many Indian Buffets, this place is clean and well maintained by the family who run this restaurant.  Food tastes fresh and is well seasoned and well cooked.  Plus I love the fresh hot naan that they offer.  Service is very friendly and prompt!  You can see the pride and passion from this family business.  Best in town!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Highly recommend. Great service. Great great food. The regular spicy was spicy enough. It's a must try if you like Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"For $7.99 you can gorge on a multitude of flavorful Indian dishes at their buffet. The restaurant had a fairly steady stream of customers here, always a good sign! The buffet had a good mix of vegetable, fried, and meat dishes. Dishes today included saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, and biriyani. My favorites were the fish curry and the malai kofta (Vegetable fritters in curry sauce).   Dessert consisted of gulab jamun, kheer, fresh watermelon, and carrot halwa. The dishes all tasted pretty good, no complaints on my end! The spice level was just right for a buffet. Not too mild but with a slight kick to make it about a low to medium level for me.  Service was friendly and attentive. In addition to the buffet items they will bring fresh naan to your table which was plentiful and refilled as needed.  My favorite Indian buffet is still Chutney's but New India Gate is cheaper and also has a good variety so it is a close second! This is a great option for lunch and I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Super good we've been to lots of Indian restaurants and this one is at the top. Very spacious modern and clean. Perfect spice levels reasonable prices we will be back for sure. This is northern style and you'll love it."}
{"text":"The servers were very friendly and attentive.  The food was very good.  I would recommend the vegetable biryani and chicken curry.  Also had lamb masala which was very tasty.  Chicken curry medium spice and had just the right bite.  We tried this place based on the other recommendations.  Prices were about normal.  Only annoying thing was the alarm on the front door which every time some opened it, it would announce front door open.  Just annoying when you are having a conversation.  Otherwise very good."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, ordered take out, I called and spoke to the nicest person, I got to the restaurant, it was big and spacious, very clean and a nice bar area to sit at where I waited for my order.  They have TV's all over the restaurant so you can sit and watch your favorite sports.  I ordered the malai kofta a vegetarian dish that's made of dough balls and curry, they ask you how spicy you'd like it, I chose regular spicy, and it was spicy enough.  Best customer service at an Indian restaurant, very good food I'll be back to try my favorite non veg dishes very soon"}
{"text":"Service was amazing!! I came shortly before time for the buffet to close and they invited me in anyway. Everyone was nice and attentive. I was trying to rush (I came about 5 min before buffet was set to close) and they told me to take my time and enjoy.   The food was very authentic! The best Indian buffet and top 3 restaurant I've been to in the valley. The food was delicious! I'll be a regular here going forward!  I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for Delish and authentic food and impressive service!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. The brothers who own this place are so friendly, and the food is wonderful. Definitely a hidden gem that we love eating at!"}
{"text":"New India Gate's buffet offers a variety of dishes for a very reasonable price--perfect for anyone who wants to sample a bit of everything. I have little authority on Indian food, but in my opinion, all the dishes were fantastic. My only complaint, is that I wish it was slightly spicier.   Very friendly service and complimentary Chai tea."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and helpful with choosing what to order. Food is great! Fast service as well. Definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"Great price, great food and the nicest staff!! absolutely amazing!! Definitely eating here again!!"}
{"text":"Twice eaten here and it is an exquisite dining experience that is absolutely emboldened by using fresh ingredients and spices that scream \"quality\". The atmosphere is light, and the dining area very very neat and clean too. This is a hidden gem in the desert! I am giddy with excitement over having such a high quality and authentic Indian restaurant in the east valley. I learned of it on msn.com in its online piece on the best restaurants in each STATE! Even though the \"best\" is a term that depends on many things, I am positive that you will not be disappointed with this choice should you make it! Bravo!"}
{"text":"This is my second coming to this place. First time I came on a weekday. On weekends the menu is richer. The only thing I personally did not like ; pork and chicken are placed close to each other. If anyone gets pork it might drop into chicken while carrying the service spoon. Quality is good. Hospitality is good. The custard is awesome.  I was told that it is available only on weekends. This is a family run restaurant and all are dedicated to quality."}
{"text":"Stopped by over lunchtime when they offer a buffet.  Overall very tasty with a good variety including several different biryani options and they do bring out fresh naan, including a garlic option in case you are concerned about vampires or do not like your dinning companions.   Will have to try for dinner to explore to explore some of the lamb options.  Owner brought out a sample of their home made ice cream with some pistachios on top which hit the spot.   Currently they are awaiting their liquor license but hopeful they will stock some local craft brew options like Santan Devil Ale which would go great with a spicy vindaloo."}
{"text":"I'm lucky to have this place only 5 minutes from me. The food is absolutely delicious. I love how you can control the heat level as well. Extremely friendly owners and staff as well."}
{"text":"Really shitty buffet , they claim to provide cheap buffet for 8 bucks but food  does not even stand up to mediocre .  Try avoiding this place , There are much better Indian restaurants in the vicinity .."}
{"text":"Despite my friend warning me, I decided to try this place for Friday lunch due to its heavy weight Yelp ratings. I was very disappointed to say the least.  Limited options. Pakoras were oily but not crispy. All the curries were bland. Chicken teeka was like chicken pieces in red cream. Only thing spicy on the buffet was chicken biryani. Taste wise it was ok, but had an over cooked texture. The rice grains were smashed or broken with the chicken. For anyone who likes like spicy AUTHENTIC Indian food, this place is NOT for him/her.  I would rate the food (entrees and appetizers) 2 star. That extra star is for service( which was great), garlic naan and gajar halwa. And yeah also for the price point."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food.  It's too bad they put hot scalding food into styrofoam containers. This produces a carcinogen. Unfortunately will not return until they put to go food into more health conscious containers. It has been known for decades."}
{"text":"Pretty good chicken tikka masala!  The wife and I both enjoyed it, we both ordered it mild, I'll probably step up to medium next time because the mild is not spicy at all, but it still has a good flavor.  The naan was hit and fresh and the rice was perfect.    We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Easy to order online. Friendly on phone. Looking forward to trying food. Always looking for good indian food as it seems hard to find in az"}
{"text":"Highly recommended. The service was amazing. Just the friendliest. Today is my anniversary and I'm so glad we chose to come here. The food is just as amazing.  I had the lamb biryani and hubby had lamb Korma. I cant say enough good things about everything. Thanks for making our anniversary special."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Everyone working stopped by several times. People don't sweeten the tea around these parts (coming from the mid west region that was different for me) but the food was amazing. Portions were hearty. You even have options on how spicy you want your food. Overall a good find."}
{"text":"Whenever we visit Mesa, searching out new restaurants is always fun but not always fruitful. The hub and I really like Indian food, but often find places disappointing-too rich, lacking complex flavors, or simply not fresh. What a treat to find this place on Yelp - it was as good as one would expect from the reviews (even leftovers heated the next day). The dal is far more flavorful than in many places, using a few different legumes and interesting spices-not full of heavy cream, more a rich gravy consistency. The Bengan Bharta had the wonderful smoky quality of eggplant roasted first in a tandoor, then sautéed with some other tasty veg and spices; yum! The garlic naan was perfectly cooked, as was the less common gobhi (cauliflower) paratha. Vegetable samosas were flaky, with excellent filling and fresh chutneys on the side. Even desserts were delicious and cooked in house. Service by two friendly and welcoming brothers (owners) couldn't be better. The whole experience is like being invited in for a home-cooked meal. We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Since moving here from San Jose , California my kids and I have been on the hunt for good Indian food.  Our search is now over.  The lamb was cooked to perfection and the Shrimp Curry was very delicious.  We usually get vegetable Samosa's however tonight we tried the beef Somasa which were amazing.  I usally do not see Beef on Indian Menu's, however it is a nice addition and look forward to trying some of the beef dishes on the menu.  The service is impeccable and the two brothers running the front make you feel like family.  The atmosphere is very inviting and the place is very clean.  Also the first really good cup of chai I have had in awhile.  This is now our go to Indian food place!!!  Now to only find a really good California style Mexican restaurant and our household will be total happy campers hahaha!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant we have found in the Phoenix area.  The food is outstanding.   Prices are very reasonable.  The two brothers who own the place are very friendly and make you feel like it's a neighborhood restaurant.  Always a big greeting when you arrive."}
{"text":"I ordered the paneer tikka makhani and the cauliflower and potato dish Friday night along with garlic naan and it was SOO FANTASTIC!!!!  I didn't think I'd eat it all in one sitting but it was sooo good I couldn't stop, haha.  And the guys in there are so nice and seem to be appreciative of your patronage.  This is my go-to for Indian food for sure!!"}
{"text":"so far the best India food I have ever had here in Arizona. not only the food bust also the environment is very clean and nice! service is great too, very friendly owners and even we bring our little one we still feel very comfortable eating here! definitely can give it a try!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a rainy day in Chandler. Not something you see very often but it was much needed rain. We were greeted by a friendly male who kindly stated we could sit where we liked. I have had my fair share of Indian food and of course some better than others but we know kinda what we wanted so it didn't take us long to view the menu and decide what we wanted to eat. We ordered a beef samosa for appetizer, chicken tikka masala and goat curry. Everything was so full of flavor, tender and the meat just melted in your mouth. The service was INCREDIBLE. All the staff members were so helpful and very attentive to make sure we were comfortable and satisfied. I will definitely be coming back for dinner and may even try their lunch buffet one day. Even if you don't like Indian just come here to enjoy the atmosphere of these impressively kind business people. We need more people and businesses that you can see care about the quality of their food and the service they provide. Great food, great service, and great environment equals happy customers. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We went to this for lunch.  Wow we were suprised.  Never really had India food before.  The staff took the time to walk us through the food and gave great I fo on the tast.  We had a great meal and are new fans of the place.  The staff was top notch."}
{"text":"We love New India Gate! Family run, family cooked simple good food at a great price. The service is wonderful. We always few guilty about eating too much on the buffet as the price seems too low for the quality and amount. It is not fancy, but it gets simple right and that is the best thing about it."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday lunch buffet. The food was really good. I would suggest you try a little of everything. My favorite was goat curry and the garlic naan. The chicken curry was good too.   This place deserved five stars because of the great service.    We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This has quickly become a new family favorite.  I took my parents here for Fathers Day and it was the best experience.  The staff and their customer service is impeccable.  The dishes that they chose for the buffet were all equally popular, and delicious.  The Naan was perfect, with the garlic being our favorite. The price, service, and taste truly earn New India Gate 5 stars."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp my wife and I decided to give their lunch buffet a try. We were welcomed as soon as we walked in. We chose our seat, we were asked what type of naan bread we wanted, plain or garlic and what we wanted to drink.  We got our plates, I tried a little bit of everything they offered. All of the food was delicious, spicy enough to enjoy. If you enjoy Indian cuisine I recommend giving this place a try. My wife and I will definitely be returning customers."}
{"text":"Awesome buffet for cheap. No goat, but it wasn't expensive either. The tikka marsala which I don't care for at most places was great. Naan came with the meal which was a pleasant surprise. Can't complain about anything. Service was really great."}
{"text":"Husband and I were visiting the area for a wedding and were pretty hungry after our long flight.  This was probably the best Indian food I have ever eaten.  Everything was SO flavorful and the pistachio ice cream was to die for.  I really did not want dessert at all, because I was so full after my meal, but somehow found room for that. The brothers that run this place are fantastic; super friendly and eager to make recommendations and menu suggestions.  The food is great but you also can't beat great service.  I have not a single negative to say about this place-go there, if you get the opportunity!  Can't wait to return to the Phoenix area-we will definitely be back when we're back in town."}
{"text":"I had dinner here yesterday (madras goat curry) and it was a very pleasant experience.  The service was outstanding and my food was very good.  Would return here for sure, this restaurant is a thousand times better than other Indian restaurants in the area.  -------  Sorry but I had to drop my 5 stars to 3 tonight, only due to my most recent order pick up experience.  I ordered a tandoori chicken, two breads, and qeema/beef samosa.  The tandoori chicken was almost raw/uncooked from the inside and the beef inside samosas was just nasty in simple terms.  It looked very raw as well.  I have no idea what happened here but the food tonight was very bad, which is unusual for this place.    Tandoori chicken was not charcoaled whatsoever, it appeared to be boiled chicken dumped into some kind of a sauce.  I've had tandoori chicken at many Indian places but nothing like this, sorry I have to disagree with the manager.  Your tandoori chicken is NOT tandoori!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Where do I begin? The decor is simple but very clean and as soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated. We encountered three waiters and every single one was super nice and they all answered any questions we had.  This was my first time eating Indian food and I am a fan. My husband had the chicken masala spice level 7 and I had a shrimp dish (I can't remember the exact name) spice level 5. We each ordered a side of basmati rice and garlic naan. Everything was absolutley delicious and not too spicy. We ended the meal with the deep fried cheese dessert which was amazing.   When you come across a place like this you want to tell everyone! There is a shortage of places to eat where not only is the service excellent, but the food is as well. They don't get all of these amazing ratings for nothing, so go check them out! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best Indian lunch buffet in AZ.  Awesome service and fresh varieties of delish Indian cuisine.  Recommend all the way!"}
{"text":"My friend and I are total foodies, and are always looking for new culinary experiences.  Indian food is definitely one of our favorites, and this place stand above the rest.  We overheard some of the other patrons who were of Indian descent, say it was like eating their mother's cooking.  The place is managed by two brothers who were incredibly gracious and attentive.  The best part of our experience other than the amazing food, was they let us take our leftovers home...that is unheard of for a buffet!  We will certainly make this a regular stop for us, especially since you can also take the buffet to go!"}
{"text":"i ordered beef curry and garlic naan and non veg appitizer plate...samosa , chilli pakoda.. and 2 pcs of wings.. it was good... but the curry wasn't.. doesn't have any indian spice flavor in it.. and the naan doesn't had enough garlic on it.. and was not cooked well... but the 3 stars for people who served the food... really had professional way of dinner... thanks.. and good luck.."}
{"text":"First of all, the food was amazing!!! Naans were different than we were used to in CA, but turned out to be very nice.   One thing I love about Indian food is that it is even better the next day. My Matter Paneer was good at the restaurant, but somehow when it's a day old and has been nuked, then it's fantastic!  Only downside to this restaurant was the service. Note to Manager: When a customer has been given their food, someone should come over and check that it is good BEFORE the customer has finished eating. I would have raved to the server about the food, but didn't get a chance. It's not like the place was busy - we were the only customers there.  But the food was great so we will be going back. I'd love to try the buffet, but then I won't get my \"day-old\" nuked food the next day! Decisions, decisions! :0)  5 stars for the food, 1 star off for the service."}
{"text":"Tried it for the 1st time today and took my picky brother and 13 year old. 2nds and more for everyone, so glad we came as we will be back!!! Awesome service, atmosphere and food.!!!"}
{"text":"I just tried this little gem. The staff is very friendly at this family owned and run restaurant. The food is delicious and made to order. They can make it as mild or spicy as you like. If you like Indian food, you won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"This is definitely good Indian restaurant in the valley. We ordered Chicken Achari and Chicken Tikka Masala.  Both taste so yummy. We ordered it Indian spicy ... And it was Indian spicy. The server in the restaurant was so friendly. They will give you good advise on what is good and what not. We got Jalebi on house which taste good as well. I would recommend this place if you plan on going with a good quality food. !!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I finally had a chance to dine in the restaurant.. The restaurant is very clean and big.. Friendly staff.. We ordered the vegetables samosa, Chicken vindaloo, mango lassi and garlic nann Everything was delicious and will definitely keep coming back for my Indian food fix.. If you enjoy getting your food spicy mango lassi will help cool your mouth"}
{"text":"[start rant]Good food with no fancy coloring or unnecessary flavor additives. Very good hospitality, esp for an Indian restaurant. The mango lassi was good too. Also ask for a side plate of lemon+onion+masala ... it goes well with curry. I found their medium spice setting a bit too mild - or may be it's just my above average spice tolerance B-)[end rant]"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food at reasonable prices. Best Indian resturant I've had around this area."}
{"text":"Great place to experience some delicious, authentic Indian food! I came in for the lunch buffet, ($7.99 weekdays, $8.99 weekend) and was immediately greeted, offered naan or garlic naan, and shown to my seat. The buffet was clean and full of curries, gravies, rices, chickens, and I believe there was even salad at the end of the buffet- but I do not go to Indian restaurants for salad!   TLDR:  Service was great, food was great, price was great. A definite recommend for all who love ethnic and cultural cuisines!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  This place deserves its 5 stars.  Perhaps the friendliest service of the many Indian joints in the Valley.  After a few years hiatus, they're back, and I'm very glad that they are.    I've been to approximately 10 different Indian lunch buffets in the Valley and I'm going to go out on a limb and say that, on the whole, this is the best.  From variety to quality, it hits all the right notes.  The friendly staff adds that much more to the experience.    I don't mind places that have bone-in chicken in their curries, but bonus points to this place for using boneless.  Their chicken tikka masala is excellent, as is their garlic naan.  I'm a sucker for kheer and their's is particularly good.  There's a great mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, complimentary chai masala also helps.  Until I find something better, this is my go-to Indian in the Valley."}
{"text":"I've come here with my Scottish friends a few times. They say that the Indian food is better in Scotland than it in the U.S. and they really like this place so that's saying something. Also you know the Indian food is good when you see a lot of Indian people eating there and there were a lot today. The food is amazing and the service is great. I just tried their lunch buffet and I am about to go in a food coma now..... :)"}
{"text":"1st time eating Indian food. So friendly and took the time to explain the different dishes. Answered all of our questions and was very informative. Our waiter gave excellent advice and suggestions. Korma and masala sauces were our favorite. The veggie Samoas were really good and so were the fried veggies. Great experience and we'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, so full of flavor! This is the best Indian food I've had. I have been to this restaurant about 4 times for the buffet special and it never disappoints. Not to mention the service as they are very attentive from the minute you walk in. The young gentleman, whom I believe is one of the owners, always offers to explain what each dish contains for those of us that are not very familiar with Indian dishes. Plus, great price for the buffet, ~$9...  it's just beyond worth it! You must try this place."}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic little gem. Very clean great service and attitude the food is off the hook. So flavorful and very reasonably priced. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for something different and incredible."}
{"text":"Had dinner on Mother's Day.  Paneer Tikka was mostly boring not much flavors. Paneer was hard. Zero for presentation. Same for Rice and Naan bread (little over cooked so not soft)..we had to wait for almost a half hour before we were checked on after serving the food..so okay customer service."}
{"text":"I took a group of 14 here for dinner and is was a unanimous hit.  The menu includes relatively traditional Indian fare with a few items that were not as familiar to me.  Every dish I tried was packed with flavor and the service was excellent.  It's a family run business with two very kind brothers taking care of the front of the house and their parents back in the kitchen cooking great food.  We were told that their meat is locally sourced and that they use some non traditional ingredients like olive oil to help keep things on the healthy side.  Their vindaloo and korma were great.  One of my friends ordered a goat dish and loved it but I didn't get a taste.  Desserts were home made and excellent as well.  Be sure to get the home made pistachio ice cream!"}
{"text":"So far I'd have to say the best I've had in 15 years of travel. Service above average authenticity seems to be there. Excellent spice recommendations.  I would recommend to anyone in the area looking for a great gem of a place to eat."}
{"text":"What a great place!  The service was super friendly and informative about the dishes.  Highly recommend this place, the Malai kofta was exceptional, as every lamb dish we tried.  Busy lunch buffet!!!"}
{"text":"Service here is always to notch and the servers and their families always go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The food here is excellent and well priced.  I'm here pretty frequently."}
{"text":"This is a decent lunch buffet, I would say pretty Americanized buffet, not spicy and sauces are very watered down, the naan was a little doughy, but everything was very fresh and tasty, they do have chai tea, worth a try but probably not worth a return trip, no mind blowing flavours but good tasty healthy cooking"}
{"text":"Fantastic! We are so glad they are \"back\". The sons of the original owners have reopened in a new location with a slightly \"New\" name. We had Paneer Tikka Masala, Chana Masala, Tandoori Chicken and Vegetable Pakora, all were excellent. The flavor and spices were so delicious we could barely stop eating. The interior is also a big improvement over the old location, more space and updated design. We will definitely be back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! One of my worries after moving to AZ was there wouldn't be any good Indian Food. This place has friendly people, amazing food, and reasonable prices. The tikka masala is my fav! I even went back for seconds!! Also, the coconut fudge is delicious! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Very authentic! If you like it spicy, ask for Fire #10. Family owned, service is outstanding"}
{"text":"It's ok. Nothing to write home about and not much of a selection.  It is fairly blanded down Indian food. It's for white people. Not many Indians eating here. They are gonna be more eating at places like Curry Corner and Kebab Palace. Much more flavors there but also pricier lunch buffets.  The employees are great here and the service is very nice. They dont state like at many Indian buffets."}
{"text":"A nice little place run by two brothers with hospitality unlike any other Indian place :) Restaurant is very clean, lighting is just perfect and food is delicious.   A very welcome addition to the Chandler food scene."}
{"text":"Our new favorite. So fresh. So good. Nice place and wonderful owners.  I had the Vegetable Korma and my husband had the Lamb Korma. Both amazing!  We also had Samosas. Theirs are light and delicious.  I love all the choices, especially all the different bread options.  We will go back!"}
{"text":"2nd time here, 1st was take out and 2nd was lunch buffet.   Both times I was very happy with the food quality and flavors.  The staff and owners are very friendly and attentive.  This is my \"go to\" Indian restaurant!"}
{"text":"The brothers are very friendly and accommodating and the food was great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, very friendly family owned restaurant. Their lunch buffet is super fresh and very flavorful. The family is extremely kind, polite and very friendly. The Garlic Nan is the best I've ever had. I highly recommend everyone eat here at least once!"}
{"text":"This place has some really good food! I was sad when the old location closed, but now that this place reopened I'm thrilled!"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing Indian food. I love love love this place. The flavors are perfectly mixed and they have some of the best Chicken Tikka Masala I have ever had. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Highly highly recommended!! Very friendly atmosphere and staff is very welcoming. If you're from Houston,tx and wanna eat indian food (non-veg) please please go and try new india gate . i promise you would love to go back . 5/5 foodtastepricecleannessfriendlystaff"}
{"text":"I had dinner here a few times. It is a nice place. The food has a Indian spicy level which is amazing since this reminds of eating spicy food in India. This is rarely seen among the other Indian restaurants. The food tastes good."}
{"text":"We went in on a Tuesday night and were a large group of 10. There were only 3 other guests while we visited however the service time felt as if it was packed. It took us nearly two hours for our food to arrive and when it did come it came in a pretty staggered manner. Food was okay at best, I've had better at lunch buffets. The only redeeming quality was that our server Gopi was pretty good. However it was a moot point since the rest of the service was shabby. I would not recommend this place unless speed is improved."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service! Very personable waiter, attentive and efficient. Place is very clean, buffet well kept. Food was delicious, we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre here unfortunately. The Indian cuisine has been diluted with a heavy Mexican influence. We came for Sunday brunch and, being extremely familiar with and appreciative of Indian food, will not be back.   The palak paneer tasted almost exactly like a green enchilada sauce with a distinct flavor of Mexican chilies and corn flour. It's very weird to look at palak, knowing it to be clearly Indian, and then experiencing an entirely different country when you put it in your mouth.  The aloo gobi also lacked depth and tasted very Americanized. The other dishes on the buffet were average.   The lovely thing about this place is that the staff are incredibly sweet and considerate. I wish them continued success, especially if this is a family owned business. My advice would be to not forget your roots!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants. They're food is always so good 100% of the time regardless if you eat from the buffet or off the menu. Also the owners and staff are so friendly and provide great service. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here with some co-workers for lunch buffet and had a great experience. Really good food and quite affordable for a lunch buffet. Nice and clean as well. I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"If you want to feel utterly stuffed, check out this lunch buffet! They have so many delicious items, you can't help but try them all. The service was fabulous, the man working there was super nice. They have my favorite Indian dessert (the rice pudding...yum!). I only wish some of their curries were spicier (but I understand that's not the nature of the buffet, I'll have to return for dinner).  I'd definitely recommend this place for their lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"We went there for the first time last night. Wow what a great experience. The customer service was outstanding as was the food also. This is the best Indian food that I have tasted since arriving here in 2006. If you like Indian food this place is a must"}
{"text":"My experience with Indian food began and ended at New Indian Gate. It was the best of times and it was the mediocre, luke warmest of times and yet I regret never trying the dessert when it was offered to me. I would really give them a 3.5 but I'm rounding up to four stars because of the customer service. Anyway, the glutton in me is constantly on the lookout for buffets so when I found this gem about 15 minutes from my job I decided to take a chance. I had only had Indian food once before from a mall food court place and I barely remember anything about it. The first time I came here, about a month ago, I came on a good day. The service was really attentive and everyone was super friendly which was constant - they have great customer service. I liked that it was a serve yourself lunch buffet and I think my total bill, with tip, came to $14 or so. They offer you a choice of regular nan or garlic nan when you are first seated. I tried a little bit of everything but fell in love with the curry chicken but the tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, and biriyani are good too. I also tried the mango lassi and it was everything. If you like mango and you like yogurt and you like creamy drinks, order a mango lassi. I was a little pressed for time so I declined having any dessert but I didn't see where the dessert was anywhere in the buffet (it's a small buffet) so I don't even know what the options were. I came back a week later and had a totally different experience. I had been thinking about New India Gate since I left, seriously. I think I came after a large group because they were pretty much cleaned out. The buffet needed to be replenished badly, there was no chicken in the chicken curry and everything else was slim pickings and only slightly warm at that. I didn't even eat my tandoori chicken because it was only a notch above cold to the touch - completely different experience than my first time, sadly. Also, no one ever asked me what I wanted to drink; I had to flag someone down to order my mango lassi which was mostly ice this time, to my disappointment. I also wasn't asked if I wanted dessert and again, since I didn't know where the dessert was, I just left without I haven't been back since then because I quickly got over my Indian food kick after that last time. I'll definitely be back but it'll be a while, I'm sure they will redeem themselves."}
{"text":"When I travel for work, I like to eat where the locals go. Came here while visiting Chandler for work training.  When I came in there was no one there which kind of worried me. The three gentleman that were working that night all were attentive. I was quickly greeted and water brought to me. I placed all my order which included veggie samosa, chicken Marsala, garlic naan, and rice pudding. The samosa was great, just like most samosas. Their chicks. Marsala or butter chicken was also great. The food wasn't anything different than your good/great Indian food. It's what I would of expected. However what makes this place a 5 star is definitely their customer service. Also, hearing the conversation from another table, it seems like their lunch buffet is very popular and attracts more of the crowd. Overall, a great experience on a local place."}
{"text":"This place is my girlfriend and I's go-to restaurant. Everything is incredible, and made from scratch. The family who runs it is so nice, as well. It's been too long since I've been here; I'm definitely coming back in the next few days! The roti and naan are incredible, and the buffet is such a great deal."}
{"text":"Quality of the food and service were excellent! Price seemed a little high for the quantity and just know that the chicken tiki masala, although very delicious, did not come with rice ."}
{"text":"I took a group of co-workers here for lunch today based on positive Yelp reviews and we had a great experience!  None of us were very familiar with Indian food so it was great that somebody was able to explain what all of the buffet items were.  All the food was excellent and the service was top notch.   We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Out of the 5-6 Indian restaurants I've been to in the valley new India gate was hands down the best experience. The service and the food were both great. I went for dinner the first time and then back twice since for the lunch buffet. All three were great. The buffet had some different dishes than other Indian restaurants than I've been to and the dishes weren't the same the two times I went which I love. To me that's part of what I love about buffets is getting to try different foods without having to order a whole meal of it. Each time they had some staples like chicken tikka which is my go to Indian meal. Love it. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for good Indian food and friendly staff. Enjoy"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food in the valley!!!!! The service is AMAZING, they take the time to explain dishes to you, recommend dishes by things you like, greet you upon entering and Thank you when you leave!!! The restaurant is very clean, the bathrooms were the cleanest I have ever been in. The whole staff is friendly, they definitely have my business for life!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a Togo of lamb Keema biryani and chicken biryani. We saw very high reviews for the restaurant and really I don't know they are real. The biryani is really terrible. I would never visit this place again for a biryani!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Great authentic Indian with fresh local ingredients. I could eat here everyday. They have a homemade ice cream dessert that was great."}
{"text":"Amazing service and some amazing Chicken Tikka Masala... Really nice setup and the naans come out fresh and good... Really good food and service is out of the world.. Two brothers who are genuine and show their effort in people skills.. The mutton and veg dishes are good too.. A few sweet items for such a low price.. Go visit and enjoy this experience"}
{"text":"I went for a lunch buffet. They don't seem to refill the empty dishes. The ones I was able to get some of were tasty. Not spicy but good taste. Service was good, people very friendly but not enough food for the price."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic indian food. They have a variety of dishes you can try on there buffet lunch. I was craving Indian food and found this gem. If your in town please stop by and try it you won't be disappointed. ."}
{"text":"I went there for a buffet lunch with my parents. The variety of dishes was good, but some were too spicy for our liking. It cost about $30 for 3 people. Clean, quiet environment for a relaxing lunch."}
{"text":"I can't see how these restaurant got high rating. Papadum was not crispy. High price small potions. I hate writing bad review but this was bad. Server was nice but food has to be better. Wings was crap as well."}
{"text":"This is a nicer space than the old location on Chandler, and the service was very friendly and efficient, but our dining experience was a mixed bag. I'm pretty sure that the rice was reheated leftovers (it was dry and kind of clumpy), and the raita is the simply the worst I've ever had. It was like a bowl of milky water with weird lumps in it. I overheard one of the young gentlemen owners tell another table that the problem was a lack of access to reliably good milk. That is the biggest bunch of baloney. Hahaha! Look, if you can't make a decent yogurt from scratch for your raita, buy yogurt. Given the choice between having to tell customers \"Sorry, we don't have raita tonight\" versus serving that mess, go with the former, please. Now, on the upside, the rest of our meal was good, and the kitchen got our food out quickly. All in all, just based on one visit, I'd say that the \"New\" India Gate is a fine place to satisfy your Indian food cravings, but it's nowhere near my first choice."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and it was amazing! The chicken tika masala was really good. Ordered medium spice and it was hotter than I expected, but still excellent flavor. The service was excellent. This place is owned by two Indian brothers and their put dad is the cook, so pretty much it's as authentic as it gets. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for their lunch buffet for $7.99 a person. They had a lot of variety but the food wasn't overwhelmingly good. They did a really good job on making my favorite curries. Their other dishes wasn't as tasteful as I would have liked. Costumer service was beyond amazing, they were very nice and had conversations with every costumer. Very homey atmosphere"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing service, amazing food and great prices. Cant ask for much more. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and recommended a curry I had never tried before. Garlic naan was spot on and you MUST try the pistachio ice cream. To die for!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! The customer service was outstanding! Very customer oriented! My glass was always full! They are very helpful and knowledgable about the food! And the food.... BEST I HAVE EVER HAD! Definitely see myself coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing india buffet. We eat here once a week. The garlic naan is awesome and my 1 year old likes the meatballs. Everyday they have different items in the buffet but at the same times they keep the classics everyday like the chiken marsala."}
{"text":"I usually don't give 5 stars but I can't go any lower.  I went for the $8 lunch buffet which runs 11;30 to 2:30..  The place is super clean, the service was excellent.  Of course since  I went in near closing at 2:25 PM  so  I was the only one there so getting attention wasn't hard.  No the buffet isn't some exotic king buffet, but for $8 you won't  find better.  I didn't care for the iced tea--it tasted like jar instant tea.  Hey guys  I know you read Yelp so hear me when I say you need to get a tea brewing machine!  I have not tried the dinner hour yet, so this only applies to the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Very happy that Yelp guided me to this establishment.  My GF and I are ethnic food junkies and have been pretty disappointed with the Indian offerings in the valley.  We have our favorite spots in the cities we travel to, but rarely eat Indian in the valley as mediocrity plagues this cadre of restauranteurs.   This spot appeared as a hot and new listing on Yelp, with 5 stars, but only 40 reviews.  Low rating always leave me feeling a bit skeptical, but what the hell, we had nothing to lose.   The restaurant had a relatively modern and minimalistic, yet warm feel.   One of the sons of the owner and chef greeted and sat us.  He was extremely personable and took a interest in our 17 month old.  He helped us review the menu and gave his recommendations.  He also told us that if we have some favorite dishes that weren't on the menu, to just ask, as his father had been a chef for many years.  We took the the challenge and ordered the Gobi Manchurian (fried cauliflower entree).  Plus we ordered several other entrees as we like to bring Indian food home as it usually makes great leftovers.  We ordered the lamb madras, an interesting chicken dish that incorporated egg in the sauce, and yet another item not on the menu, chili chicken.  We customized our order of naan, adding chilies and garlic.  Everything tasted great and to our surprise, the non menu items were our favorite.  The Gobi Manchurian rocked.  It was better than any other I have had.   It is family owned and got to meet the two brothers/ sons of the owner.  Both incredibly personable.   We are very excited to return and even more excited about eating the leftovers today."}
{"text":"Best customer service! Just grabbed our food to go. The food smelled and looked amazing. I was so excited to try this place, especially since it's so close to us. I was not disappointed by the flavor of the food. Everything is made fresh and from scratch. Will keep coming here for sure!"}
{"text":"This is one the best places I have ever been at that has the greatest food ever!!!! Their staff is friendly and the food is amazing. Would highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED Very friendly and helpful staff - lunch buffet extensive hit fresh and amazingly good - at least the two dishes I tried below were a solid 10 can't get better and excellent dessert and large fresh salad buffet for $10 bucks out the door eat until you  are as full as you desire quiet simple design in the same strip mall as Starbucks on ray and rural   Recommend: Chicken Curry Chicken Tikka Masala  Desserts are excellent  Great Value!!!"}
{"text":"This buffet is better than anything I've ever tasted!!!! Their chicken tikka masala is to die for."}
{"text":"I'm new to Indian food and have only tried a handful of them but I'm also a big foodie and I'm super picky about food. That being said, I was really impressed with the food at New India Gate. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere when we walked in and we were greeted right away. We actually had several servers through the evening and my favorite was a well-dressed younger man who was very attentive (might have been a manager or owner?)  I ordered chicken tikka masala and some samosas. We got a little appetizer of a crispy cracker-like think with some sauces that was really tasty (sorry, don't know what it's called--told you I was new!) and then the samosas came out. We did some veggie and some meat and they were great--the veggie, in particular. However, we did have to wait quite a bit for our main dish to come out. The guy did stop by to apologize for the wait and I saw him and the others doing their best to get food out as soon as it was ready. It was worth the wait because it was all very good. I got mine mild and it was just right for me. Also enjoyed the garlic naan but I would suggest they add jasmine rice to the menu instead of or in addition to the standard white rice. They were offering a yelp deal for new customers which we took advantage of and the ticket was really quite reasonable. I'd absolutely go back and would recommend over the other ones that I've tried in Tempe."}
{"text":"Karen W told me about this hot/new Indian restaurant located in the city of Chandler. How can I pass it up? Little did I know they offer $8 all you can eat buffet & the store location is where iSushi was at before they closed down (sniff sniff...).   When the door was opened, I can smell curry at every corner of the restaurant. Most of the tables are full and majority of the clients are Indians. That is usually a sign that their food is super authentic. Since I don't know much about Indian food, I basically took a little bit of different curry to try out. Wow it was absolutely delicious. Each table also comes with either plain or garlic bread. I dipped it into the curry sauce and it was so heavenly. By the time I was on my 2nd plate, I was already full.   Food is delicious & their service is great. I'll most definitely come back here again.   P.S. if you check in at this place, they will give you 10% discount."}
{"text":"We went to this wonderful gem to indulge in some authentic Indian cuisine. Man oh man, did we ever! Everything was good, great, and even better. One of the owners suggested that we do the buffet over the menu and glad that we listened. The buffet had all of the items that we would normally order and then some. Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tiki Masala, Goat Curry, jasmine rice, etc... If you love Indian food, if you've never had it before, or if you you're just hungry for some delicious food go check this wonderful family owned business out. You can thank me later."}
