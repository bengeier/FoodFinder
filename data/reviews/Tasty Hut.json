{"text":"we discovered this place and went in to try it out. the servers were very nice and we told them we cannot handle spiciness. Servers said no problem, they can make the dishes not spicy for us. 

We ordered steamed buns (the dish was supposed to be half steamed & half deep flied, we changed to all steamed), wood fungus in sauce, pumpkin millet congee, bbq cauliflower and cumin lamb stir-flied. 

Nothing much to say about steamed buns as it can only be made one way and every restaurant does it the same way; the fungi tasted good but the only problem was they didn't mix the sesame oil & salt well enough, so the flavour is not even among the whole dish; pumpkin millet is lacking taste; bbq cauliflower taste like bbq'ed vege! Lol. The only really tasty dish was the cumin lamb dish.

The dishes were ok, not especially yummy but service was very good. Servers were very nice and accommodating.  Will come again and try other dishes."}
{"text":"So worried about the sanitary environment. Diarrheal heavily to the hospital after eating. Food is too salty and not authentic Chinese food. Not worthy for the price. The service is totally bad.  Make pork face. So suck experience of eating. Will not go there again."}
{"text":"I don't understand previous review. I went there three times each time it's so great. I went today ordered stinky tofu. Omggggg. Ssoooo goooood. And beef stripes cold dish. Awesome. I like how their flavor is adjust to be less salty and spicy. Just tell them.  Service is quick. Want to go back soon."}
{"text":"My Fiancè and I came here to eat on a Thursday night. 
Not too busy, max 3 tables. 
We orderd;
-mixure of seafood and vegetable hotpot. ( had 3 shrimps and 5 small squids, 17$)
-small order of stinky tofu(not so authentic and portion waaaaaay too small for 7$)
-2 bowl of steamed rice 2$/bowl. ( rice had horrible consistency)

Portion size was super small and the food was not worth the price. 
We will definitely not be returning. Our server was super polite and friendly though."}
{"text":"This food is salt and has no flavour. Expensive and useless and the staff are unfriendly!  Avoid it."}
{"text":"Website prices are outdated. Items cost a few dollars extra (per item) in reality. Given the discrepancy, I'm guessing that they are intentionally not updating the website. Kind of shady. 

That being said, I do like the food, so I will continue to go back. The stuff that we ordered were Hunan style dishes. Tasted pretty authentic, although it was not very spicy. Dishes were in the $10-15 range for the most part. Quantities are generous. We had 3 dishes to share between 2 people. Should be enough for 2 meals actually. 

I think this place is owned by the same person/people who own Konner (off Midland). The food is pretty much the same, and I think the prices are the same too. 

Conveniently located near Finch station.

{"text":"Delicious homestyle cooking! Everything pairs really well with rice and makes me want more! Great little find in the Yonge and finch area for everyday Chinese food. We ordered the Garlic pork slices (Shuan Ni Bai Rio), The stewed cabbage, the fish soup with sour cabbage, and the lamb skewers. 
Fed 3 people and was about $20 pp after tax and tip. I shall be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Spicy Fish Fillet Cooked in Chilli Oil (Water Cook Fish). Large order was $21.99 plus tax - average price, but it was disappointing.  The dish was missing a main ingredient - mala spice. So it was missing a lot of flavour, didn't have any spicy flavour at all.

We also order Pork Ribs with Potatoes, was super super salty, we couldn't stop drinking beer because it was so spicy..

The Lamb Skewers were so-so.. a passing 3 stars.

The best dish was the dumplings! I think $5.99 or $6.99 for a dozen dumplings.. the wrapping was good! Tasted almost homemade.. the soup sauce, in my opinion had a wasabi flavour to it.. but my company didn't taste it all..

At the end, we all enjoyed he dumplings but all voted to never come back..

Place isn't the same as it was a couple years and it has definitely changed management.

Service was prompt."}
