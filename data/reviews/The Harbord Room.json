{"text":"Really awesome beef burger. Tasty water :p.odd but true. Yummy dessert.  Cosy atmosphere.  Friendly staff. Deffinatly recomend it :)."}
{"text":"Made a reservation about a week & a half in advance for a party of 8 people for a late friday night dinner (9 pm). 

Food: 4.5/5
- the burger was a favourite. It was absolutely delicious
- the sea bream was cooked to perfection
- the flatiron chicken was also being raved about
- the only reason the food doesn't get a perfect 5/5 is that one person ordered a steak which was cooked well but unfortunately it had a lemony pesto that couldn't be rubbed off and ruined the taste of the steak
-we brought our own bottles of wine and paid a $30 corking fee for each bottle so I will be back to try the cocktails

Ambiance: 4.5/5
- small, intimate, dimly lit restaurant
- there was a mix of dressier and more casually dressed people
- it was very busy and some people came in and had to leave because the restaurant was full

Service: 5/5
- attentive and helpful
- although there was a large group of us, we didn't wait too long for the food and it was all cooked perfectly
- we also didn't feel rushed at all and felt we could relax and have conversation comfortably while eating and drinking

I would highly recommend making a reservation to this restaurant for a romantic date or catching up with a few friends over a delicious meal."}
{"text":"The Naturally Raised Beef Burger at the Harbord Room is one of the highlights of Toronto. Harbord Street has a lot going on, and The Harbord Room feels like a private hangout.

When I visited the Harbord Room I ordered the last burger of the night. The chef left nothing behind. A perfectly cooked beef patty was paired with sharp cheddar, caramelized onions, and a bun that melted into a perfect combination of flavor. I added bacon as the finishing touch on mine and it was perfect. Eating this burger was a pure joy and the fact it was plated so well,and paired with excellent fries, sold me even more."}
{"text":"It's a snug, cozy, comfortable, homestyle place with an approachable hint of sophistication. They have a wide range of liquors, some of which I'd never heard of, and the service is friendly and inviting. Coming off a recent visit to Marben, I had to try the burger. As was the case with Marben (which I preferred slightly), it's small, and much more reminiscent of a meatloaf than a classic burger. Was also on the verge of containing too much inedible gristle, but... kudos on atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to Harbord Room for the first time last night with my wife and daughter. The place is very small but absolutely charming, it's done up in a very French-bistro style, down to the ceiling fans powered by a single motor and a long belt. Atmosphere is warm and inviting, service is polite and unpretentious. I had the warm octopus salad to start, which was divine and very flavorful. My wife and I had the fish on special as our main, a pan seared trout with a beautifully smokey eggplant puree. My daughter chose the soft gnocchi with wild board ragu', which I tasted and was superb. We finished off with their carrot cake re-interpretation, also good. Wine selection is decent, we picked a bottle of Easton's Terre Rouge Tet-a-Tet red (delicious). Bill including wine ($70) and tip came to $260 for 3, not cheap but not extravagant. I would come back here."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of people we blown away by the food. Maybe because I was extra hungry that day, but I ordered a few things,and I HIGHLY recommend them all! :)

Ontario Whitefish Ceviche ($13) --  I could actually taste the sweet freshness of the fish. And with the diced watermelon and this was the perfect summer dish: light, refreshing, and appetizing!

Braised Rabbit Red Fife Tagliatelle ($20) -- As a warning the mustard seeds in this dish are quite overpowering and I find it's lacking in a bit of sauce. but other than that the rabbit is delicious! I think a part of me feels guilty even say that though; why would you want to eat such a fluffy cute animal? =(

 
Naturally Raised Beef Burger ($16) -- The Harbord Room burger is ranked by Toronto Life as the #1 Burger in Toronto. So naturally ordering this was a no brainer. I haven't tried too many of the burgers listed, so I can't attest to whether or not it is deserving of it's reign in Toronto, but I can say it was one darn good burger. The bun was soft and almost flakey like a croissant, ecompassing a juicy patty that is just on the brink of being uncooked. We opted to add bacon for $2, but I'd say you don't really even need it. I find it gets lost in the rest of the burger goodness.


Fresh Ricotta Doughnuts ($9) --these were soft (like pillows!) with a hint of lemon in the dough. But the highlight of that plate was in the dulce. Creamy and smooth with tapioca and whipped cream to give it a little bit of a kick!


Baked to Order Valrhona Chocolate Cake ($9) -- I can't even begin to describe how good this was. The chocolate cake is baked fresh to order in a small ramakin and filled with a thick peanut butter ganache. The chopped nuts on top are sugar glazed making them taste almost like caramel. Top that off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and I don't see how you can go wrong with this dessert. I think I would literally come back to The Harbord Room just for this!"}
{"text":"I've tried their burger and their charcuterie plate.

Burger was served with a side salad of arugula as well as fries. It came with their in house ketchup as well as a lemon aioli. That ketchup is great, I honestly could not stop eating it until I polished off my fries. I asked for a medium rare burger and that was what I received. It was also the juiciest burger I'd ever had. Highly recommend that burger. 

Now that Kerr farms has gone bankrupt, there's the question of if their beef sourcing is going to change and how it might change for better or worse.

Their charcuterie plate makes for really decent shared snacking. It's no Black Hoof but it sure is tasty. My favourite thing on it was probably the terrine that came with it as well as the currant compote but everything else was good, too.

Bottom line: I really should go here more often but I don't."}
{"text":"HUGE flavor of local ingredients, fresh fish delivered every day, killer cocktails and a GREAT neighbourhood feel. Always busy...and the room is usually filled with other popular chefs in the city - a great sign!"}
{"text":"We managed to score a table on the back terrace and had cocktails and dinner as the sun went down. It was gorgeous and the food was great. (The cocktails were even better, especially the heritage Toronto cocktails.) We had the pork chop with pineapple-cashew salsa. It was some of the best cooked pork I have ever had; the pineapple was an unexpectedly excellent complement to the pork. I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Had one bad experience (petite brunette server with long very straight hair who was quite dismissive and pretentious) and one ok experience (brunette female server with short wavy hair who was slightly less pretentious but basically polite). Food is nothing special, ambience is ok, prices are a tad high, portions are small, selection is ok, quality is \"nice\". The burger is quite average...Not sure why this restaurant is highly regarded..."}
{"text":"We came for desserts only, and these exceeded the expectations! The selection is ... very limited , which is good, as you dont spend too much time choosing :-) All seem to be freshly made. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Having eaten at a few places on Harbord Street, I've walked by the Harbord Room many times without even knowing it was there. The restaurant is located in an old house and lacks signage.

Upon entering the Harbord Room, I was surprised by how small the space was. It's long and narrow, featuring a bar down one side of the room. They also have a nice patio in the back - perfect for the summer. Since the restaurant is quite small, I'd recommend making a reservation.

Known for their great cocktails, I had to get one. I'm a sucker for fruity drinks and went with the Sangria - pink wine, fresh strawberry & rhubarb juice, a splash of brandy & a medley of berries and kiwi ($14). Their sangria is pre-made in individual mason jars and is oh-so-delicious. One of the best sangria's I've had... and I've had a lot of sangria!

What else went in my belly:

Ontario Whitefish Ceviche - poblano relish, tomatillo, pickled watermelon, corn nuts & lime cream ($13): Loved the presentation - bright, vibrant colours! Sometimes ceviche can be a little one dimensional but the one at Harbord Room had many layers of flavours and created a light and refreshing dish. 

Naturally Raised Beef Burger - sharp cheddar, caramelized onions on an egg bun with fries and a little salad ($16): Added house smoked maple and jack bacon for an extra $2. I can see why this burger is ranked #1 by Toronto Life. Juicy, flavourful and oh-so-delicious. Loved it all. 

Soft Shell Crab Po'Boy - red cabbage slaw, house pickles with tarragon & old bay mayo & chips ($17): Gotta get your fix of soft shall crab while its still in season. This came with two small po boys and while it was tasty, it wasn't particularly memorable.

Fresh Ricotta Doughnuts - espresso & caramel pot de crème, espresso tapioca & crumble meringue wafer ($9): ). While I couldn't detect much ricotta flavour in the doughnuts, it made a huge difference in texture as they were a little denser and had a creamier texture. My boyfriend loved the doughnuts but I think I prefer regular doughnuts... The pot de creme was amazing though!

Overall, a great dinner! Don't leave without trying their amazing burger, which was easily the highlight of our meal."}
{"text":"My new favorite place. Charming little place, fantastic service, amazing cocktails and perfect food. This place does it right.
Quite memorable."}
{"text":"Patio is awesome.  The food was really quite great as well.  You may even see Rachel from Suits hanging there.   Great food and great scenery."}
{"text":"I've been to The Harbord Room twice now and it's hands down my favourite restaurant in the city (Sorry Gio's!). 

Both times I've had the Steak & Frites and holy fuck, it's the best steak I've had in my life. Get it medium rare and then just suck the whole thing down. Both times I've been tempted to lick the left over juices right off the plate, but this place is kinda fancy-like, so that would probably be frowned upon. 

The last time I was there, the three annoying girls next to me all ordered the burgers and mother of God did they ever look and smell delicious (the burgers, not the girls). If only it wasn't for my impeccable sense of social decency, I would've totally punched one of the chatty Kathys in the face and stolen her juicy, perfectly cooked meat, along with the wonderfully moist egg bun that encased it, right off her plate.

The fries are great too.

And they have many a beer in various bottle sizes and lots of vino. 

Oh, and Paul Gross hangs out there as well. So if you want a little Canadian celebrity in your life, this might be the place to go. It's tiny, but in the Summer their patio doubles their capacity - but reservations are always best. 

I will go back often - well, as often as my bank account allows, that is..."}
{"text":"Summary:

Great food and cocktails.


Went back to the Harbord Room recently after not being here for a while.

It was as good as I remember. I had the bavette of beef, and my wife had the chicken. Both were great. We also had some nice oysters and the daily raw plate (trout tartare) to start.

Cocktails are fun and delicious, and they have a decent wine list."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I decided to celebrate our one year anniversary here after wanting to go for so long. Prior to going, I made sure to check out some quick recommendations from some other folks online in order to get an idea of what we should order. Unanimously, the burger was the suggested entree, so that is what we ordered along with the 45 day aged steak, both of which we split and shared. 

The burger apparently has been voted number one in Canada and twelfth in the world so we were really hoping the burger would live up to the hype. The burger was, in fact, very, very good. I found the patty to be incredibly moist and the bun to be soft and fluffy. I definitely recommend it though I wouldn't say it was particularly mindbogglingly amazing, especially with the trail of accolades under its bun but it was still a very satisfying bite. The homemade ketchup, however, was out of this world! We didn't expect it to be so tasty! The steak was wonderfully seasoned and cooked and the fingerling potatoes were so delicious I could eat a whole plate of them on its own.  

For dessert we ordered the Brown Butter Cake and decided to share a cocktail, which by the way, was gorgeous to look at. The cocktail menu was so enticing and impressive that we made it a point to continuously come back to try every single one of them on the list. It was truly top notch!

Something worth noting was that our waiter was super attentive, incredibly relaxed and cool and was very knowledgeable about the menu. It was very surprising to the both of us how casually he wandered between tables and was still able to attend to his guests. It made our dinner very relaxed and comfortable, which we appreciated very much. In fact, the entire place was quite warming and everybody kept wishing us happy anniversary which was very sweet. It made our entire evening incredibly delightful. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night for an 8:30 reservation. Cute place. They seated us at the back by the kitchen at one of the high bar tables (not easy to get into for a 34-week pregnant woman).  I got the side order of venison bolognese tagliatelli as an appetizer, and for my main I got the risotto.  Both were delicious. Pasta was done perfectly al dente. The risotto with the sweetness of the corn and crunchiness of the pinenuts were a great contrast. Would definitely return again. The only negative was our waiter did not explain the night's specials to us, although he did tell the table beside us."}
{"text":"This place is really good, even though I am not a fan of burgers, which is their specialty. My husband and son are big burger lovers, so we go to Harbord room quite often. My personal favorites there are the Octopus Salad and deserts. I tried all of the deserts and I think Brie & Rhubarb is the best! Makes me hungry as I'm writing this :-)
BTW, there is another great place on Harbord if you like Mediterranean food, it's 93 Harbord."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the world, not just Toronto. The burger and charcuterie board are game changing. An ever changing menu that is updated with seasonal ingredients. Great atmosphere both inside and on the patio. The cocktails and wine list are top notch. 

Go there now!"}
{"text":"I dined here with 11 other members of Taste Buds on Dec 10th. As I have been dining at HR regularly over the last few years, I had hyped it up as my \"go-to\" resto in all of Toronto. Our experience lived up to expectations, if not exceeded them. I believe Vanessa was our server (apologies if I got this wrong) and she was very attentive and accommodating a we were doing a Kris Kringle before the food could be served. She even gave us separate bills voluntarily and waived the group gratuity...again voluntarily. Most of us had their famous burger and it was juicy and flavourful. Drinks of course are amongst the best in the city.

Thank you again for yet another wonderful dining experience.

{"text":"Went here the other night, we tried the following:

- Burger with bacon
Don't get the bacon. It doesn't add much plus its canadian bacon instead of american bacon. The burger itself is pretty good.I wouldn't say its the best burger ever but solid burger. Best that I had so far in Toronto, but not when compared to other cities.

- Bavette of beef
The beef was slightly disappointing. Everything you got on the place was pretty tasty except for the beef itself. It was a bit too chewy with not too much flavor itself. The sweet potato and brussel sprouts were great though.

- Ricotta Doughnuts
These were the disappointment of the night. My standard for little doughnuts are from Lola in Seattle. These were far below that. A bit too dense with no real taste of ricotta.

The service and ambiance was nice. Overall, the food was good but a bit too pricy. If our bill was 1/2 to 3/4 as much, this would be a great deal. As it is, its probably a good place to try once but not a place to frequent often."}
{"text":"Tried this place as part of the Telus for Tuesday deal (buy an entree, get a dessert and app for free). 

Having read the reviews I was super excited to try a couple of things, the famed burger and the veal bolognese. Sadly, neither of these were on the menu when we arrived. Likely this is because the burger was relatively cheap compared to the rest of the main courses so they decided not to offer it on the Telus nights (totally understandable) and the review raving about the veal was quite old. 

I ended up having the steak frites and my date had the rib-eye. My steak was a lot leaner than his, with almost no fat anywhere, and absolutely delicious. The fries were just okay, nothing incredible.

The atmosphere was lovely, and the wait staff were very friendly. The cocktails menu was disappointing. It was very heavy on whiskey-based concoctions, which didn't really appeal to me, so I went for a Plymouth gin-based drink called \"The Last Word\" (my date just had a beer). I'm a huge gin fan so I was a bit surprised at the taste -- it might have been my imagination, but it just plain tasted like whiskey to me! No idea why!

Pricewise, we ended up paying about $90 for two people (tip included), and that's with our appetizers and desserts coming free. I'll go back to try the burger, because so many people say it was great and the steak I had was really good, but I'll be steering clear of the cocktail menu (ranging from $13-$18 per drink)."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, and the service as well.  The only reason they lost a star is one of the items we ordered did not arrive and they were out of a beer on the menu. But I definitely recommend it and will go back."}
{"text":"Great food. The shared green beans are so tasty... food is very flavourful. Service was great. My husband had the hamburger and loved it. It has a romantic/intimate feel but it's not pretentious.
It's a pretty small place and we were seated by the door - which wasn't ideal. Every time the door opened, there was a draft - trust me, in winter weather, kind of a buzzkill."}
{"text":"Spent yesterday night on the Bar at the Harbord room... a wonderful place... it is one of the only places in Toronto were i can step in at 1030pm and get food from the kitchen. I had the burger and it was great. I stayed there until midnight, the place was packed. Great music, nice barman, all the right things to make my evening out, a wonderful experience! ... the place is so small... during the summer they have the patio but during the winter... you probably need to make sure you have reservations especially during the weekends and dining times"}
{"text":"Agree with Mary C's review. The patio out back is cozy and shaded by a large pear tree. The service was really professional and friendly- very laid back atmosphere. Ordered the burger (Toronto Life's #1- it's certainly worthy of consideration)- delicious tasting beef, fed with organic feed to give it a different texture and color, stays pinkish even when ordered well-done. It came with the best french fries I've ever tasted and some fresh micro-greens. We had the chili coated baby bok choy as a side; my partner ordered the summer squash risotto which was also delicious, and we each had a 'composed' salad with heirloom tomatoes and buffala mozzarella. Homemade bread with pumpkin seeds was also very nice. Everything tasted fresh and simply delicious- nothing over the top, just simple food artfully presented. We were impressed and will return next time in town."}
{"text":"Terrific restaurant. Friendly and prompt service. The chicken entree was fabulous (according to others in our party). The hamburger was perfect - goldilocks portion with crisp and tasty fries. Coleslaw was crunchy - no overuse of creamy sauce."}
{"text":"Really poor unhelpful service. Small portions and tough beef!!!
Ridiculous long wait for food and run out of dessert that we wanted!
Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great ambience, cosy and intimate. Our server was excellent. We had the leek and eggplant starter to share and both had the burger - very tasty!! All round excellent dining experience!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The drinks are phenomenal, my mint julep was fantastic. The oysters were fresh and the mains are delicious. So glad we found this place."}
{"text":"I look for different things in a restaurant as a tourist vs. a local.  As a tourist I'm less concerned about price and more concerned with the feeling of a place.  Good places will be good objectively but there are many places I'd visit first as a tourist and less as a local.

This restaurant was perfect for a tourist.  The food is exquisite, but exquisite food is available many places. More importantly for the tourist, the place itself feels very 'Toronto' (or what I conceive such a feeling to be).  Warm and inviting with a purpose that is well-executed.

I may have missed some originality when I order the hamburger.  The burger itself is cooked well.  The highlight are the perfectly caramelized onions on top.  Caramelized onions take forever to make and the phrase has become devalued as barely caramelized onions pass as the real thing.  These are real and they're spectacular.  

My companion's dish had a surfeit of originality and was equally amazing; but now I'm stuck reminiscing about the onions!"}
{"text":"Great service, solid food.  Recently refreshed with a new paint job and an incoming update on the bar counter, it still has the same cozy intimate feel from before.  
Top quality tasty burger.  Would definitely return if in the area."}
{"text":"Loved going to this place the past few years until recently. I would put up with the slow service because the food was always good and the servers were friendly and professional. However this time I  ordered the burger and couldn't eat it. It was too raw and had no flavour. My partner ordered the fish and the sauce it was served with didn't complement the fish at all. Sadly I won't be going back as it is too expensive for not having a consistent high quality."}
{"text":"Burger $17 + $2 bacon.
10/10. The burger I've been waiting for. Good hearty feel once you hold it. Consistent flavour with each bite. Served on a marble table. Plank style presentation, burger had egg bun that was sweet, savoury and extra yummy. This burger has the ultra YUM factor. Meat was made of beef cheek and shoulder. Cooked med rare. Cheese...mmmm...perfectly melted on the meat to work with the burger like bread n butta. Bacon was flaccid but very tasteful. Fries were crispy and tasty. Homemade aioli an ketchup sauce. Coleslaw was ok. Overall this is my favourite burger in Toronto. Also on the burger quest as Toronto Life rated them and before this stop Elleven had my vote with their Maple burger. Rated #12 in the world, #1 in Toronto. Definitely lived up to its hype. Try it. You won't be disappointed. We got there right when it opened (at 5:30pm) and I think we were the first burger customers of the night. That said. Get there early to have the same experience as us!! I'm sure if you go any other time it'll be just as amazing."}
{"text":"We made reservations a week in advance and went on Friday the 13th of December, and Friday the 13th lived up to its reputation as the people joining us from all over the city were trapped in snow squalls, transit was delayed, and cabs were difficult to catch. It snowed 15cm Friday and the roads were choppy, with temperatures reaching -22C after windchill. We did eventually all arrive and get settled in. 

The first thing I noticed upon arriving was THR&CO just down the road at 93 Harbord. I saw the sign and started heading there as the initials matched up; until I realized the number was wrong. I readjusted my trajectory to find The Harbord Room at 89 Harbord in what appeared to be a converted house with no noticeable signage (I see a photo here as I write this, of very small, white watermarking on their windows which would have been camouflaged by snow). I was greeted at the door by a host who offered to hang up my bulky winter coat, and I noticed that the dining room was cozy (maybe a 30 - 40 seater including the bar) and warmly decorated.

I was the second of my party of 6 to arrive, and my friend was there at our table with glasses of water and menus set out on the table. There were 4 or 5 of each red and white wine available by the glass, and a much longer list of wines available in larger formats.

After the rest of the party arrived, we took a peek at the food menu. The food menu is short; but the description of each item revealed each to have many complimenting flavour components. We had a couple of members of our party with dietary restrictions ask our server about ingredients. Our server disappeared to the kitchen to relay the questions and returned with detailed, helpful answers.

For starters, we shared an octopus salad and another pair at the table shared a fried green tomato salad. Each arrived, beautifully presented, in rectangular server platters. The octopus salad was small in portion; but very tasty. Slices of octopus on the bottom, topped with sausage, drizzled in a mild tomato/chili dressing with sprigs of greens, paper-thin shavings on onion, and some roasted chickpeas.

I didn't get to tried the tomato salad; but it looked slightly larger, with more greens and veggies, and a brick of goats cheese included to spread on fried tomato slices.

I ordered the bavette of beef. The server told me that the cut was between the sirloin and porterhouse, then immersion circulated in sous-vide at the temperature of rare beef. When ordered, it would be removed, grilled or torched to brown and sear the outside and bring the inside to a medium rare. When it arrived it was sliced into pieces a bit bigger than bite-sized and placed on top of what seemed like fried, then roasted brussel sprouts drizzled in a little bit of au jus. The meat was cooked to a perfect medium-rare as promised, topped with a line of green poblano pepper salsa, which had a mild acidity and very subtle heat. Around the plate there were 3 or 4 deep fried cheese puffs, a couple of thick steak-cut onion rings, and a dollop of sweet potato puree. The portions of the sides were modest, and the focus was really on the beef and the brussel sprouts. 

My sharing companion ordered the chicken, which came two-ways. A large breast was roasted to succulent perfection. The skin was seasoned and and crisped, while the meat was tender and juicy. My experiences were slightly less detailed with this plate; but there was a small buttermilk-fried chicken leg. The batter was light, flaky, and not too salty, the meat inside was piping hot and juicy. You could tell that everything came straight out as soon as it was ready. My friend mentioned there were at least 3 different sauces on her plate and marvelled at how much work and flavour went into each dish.

Two friends down the table ordered the hamburger, which came presented on a wooden board with an assortment of sides and sauces. It was cooked to medium and one of the people who ordered it proclaimed it was the best burger she had in Toronto, topping out Mildred's Temple (I have never been; but I know 2 burgers I'm trying in the new year!).

Unfortunately, we did not get to try dessert because we booked a time slot prior to a private party (we were informed of this when making the reservation, so not a big issue). 

Another thing I noticed later on in the evening was I was not crazy thirsty like I usually get after dining out at a restaurant. I can't say for sure; but it seems like they were able to develop plenty of flavour in all of their food without the overkill of salt.

Looking forward to return for a burger and dessert!"}
{"text":"Visited with a friend on a Wednesday night. We were actually looking to head somewhere else nearby, but since it was packed we had to find a new spot, not too far, and we had heard great things about Harbord Room so thought we'd give it a try.

It is small, and dark, but the atmosphere is cozy and relaxing.  We went right in and sat at the bar.  I'm not much of a wine drinker but had some great recommendations given to me that I'll be trying at home now too.  The staff were friendly and helpful and the food (vegetable salad and oysters) did not disappoint!   A little pricey, but easily worth a few good drinks and some amazing food... If we want to continue the night after that, we just move on. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Wow! If I could give my Dry Aged Beef Burger ($19) a 6 out of 5, I would. I was so impressed with this place.

We got a table on their outdoor patio at the back, which was quaint and cozy. The selection of beers, wines and cocktails was extensive. Our corn polenta to start was fantastic. But the star of the show, no doubt, was the burger - everyone at our table ordered the same thing (and don't forget the bacon!).

They make their burgers in house, so get ready for a burger that's medium rare and juicy. Combine that with aged cheddar, caramelized onions and slaw on an egg bun - there are no words!

This is the kind of place I would 100% come back to, and that's saying a lot with the endless variety of awesome restaurants in this city. And you best believe that I'll be ordering that burger again. Check out The Harbord Room - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. They features farm to table food. I love the charcuterie board and burger there! Desserts are always delightful!!"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to come here for the highly rated burger and after a couple of years of waiting, finally got the chance. Not sure how the reservation system works but I was trying to book on a Friday night at 10pm and the website said they were full for the next couple of hours. I then tried to get 11pm and it gave me the option to pick 10pm instead. Go figure.

It was pretty apparent that the popular order was the burger because seems like everyone was having it. We got the burger, the charcuterie board, and the pasta. The charcuterie order was interesting. I did not find any element particularly great and that includes the deep fried egg. All good not great. The pasta which was supposedly made with a hazelnut pesto was a bit bland and forgettable. Rather disappointing.

Obviously the best dish of the night went to the burger. Perfectly medium and the bun they used to it was just right. Soft, but robust enough to not get soggy from the all the juices of the patty (and yes it was juicy). The cheese, the aioli, these went well together to create a solid sandwich. 5 stars for the burger, 2 for the pasta, and 3 or 4 for the board."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for his birthday/Valentine's dinner. We had oysters, the burger and the ricotta donuts for dessert. All were fantastic, especially the dessert. Whoever dreamed that one up is a genius. I'm not much of a cocktail/scotch drinker, but The Ronald Clayton really got me hooked. We ordered 2 because it was so good! My only complaint is it was a difficult place to find and there wasn't much parking. It was a very cold night and because the place is small, it felt like a freezer every time someone walked into the restaurant. Other than that, i would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype, ladies and gentlemen. The burger is the truth. The charcuterie board is also the.... uh... very good as well. The drink menu has excellent choices that will make you glad that thirst is a thing that the human body requires you to satiate. Make a reservation. Go to here. Eat. Be happy that you are alive. Also great service. 5 stars for the food, a dozen high fives for all of the other things."}
{"text":"My boyfriend kept asking where I wanted to go for our anniversary so naturally I turned to the lovely people of Yelp for the answer and I was really happy I did. 

Right when we walked in I noticed that the restaurant was in fact a room, very small and intimate! If you don't make a reservation I bet It would be hard to get a table there. 

I do recommend that if you are going for dinner in a larger group that you think about somewhere else as there aren't many large tables. Though I heard in the sumer there is a patio so that could be a different story in warmer weather.

We both got the steak and a glass of a spanish red wine ( I can't remember which it was..whoops) Anyways It was really amazing, might be the best I've had in a while. The only negative I have to point out is My boyfriends steak had a large piece of bone in it that was clearly cut so someone knew what they were serving. Other than that no complaints! 

I have to go back and try the burger everyone is talking about!"}
{"text":"Very nice patio covered in luscious green. Good food, interesting cocktails. A bit off the beaten path behind an inconspicuous exterior, this place provides a nice quite getaway."}
{"text":"Boy what a difference a year makes. Despite cherishing this spot as memorable for moi due to being one of the few ROTD by me I feel I need to update the review for this place. This was a planned visit and we had made reservation already knowing how hard it is to get a spot here on the weekend. 
Unfortunately the service was a warning sign from the get go. This was one of colder day in December and right after we walked in the place was chilly. On top of that we were seated at a table which would get gusts of cold air whenever the entrance door was opened (and remained open due to the faulty mechanism I guess in some instances). I asked to be seated elsewhere but were only offered the dreaded bar (read the previous review for the catch on sitting at the bar) and after complaining about the seating I was told by the host that its an old space and the cooling is off a bit and she feels cold as well (Bravo for making me realize that I am not alone in feeling the cold!)
Ah well on to the main reason we ordered the burgers and for app had the Charred Leek & Eggplant Borani. The pita chips it was served with were quite greasy and the dip was not portioned well as we ended up leaving a lot of them. Seasoned well IMO. 
Now for the burger it was a lot off from what it was as I recall. The fries weren't good on this visit and felt cold. Something off with the seasoning on them too (I think I tasted the nori flake but I could be wrong here) The main attraction was overcooked IMO even though I asked for chef's choice (medium rare). The ketchup was way too smokey on this visit. I guess it started with the poor attitude from the start and just went down from there in my experience. I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I was on a mission to try Toronto's best burger (according to Toronto Life magazine). Happy to report that I FOUND IT. 

The GOOD...

- Fantastic, friendly and efficient service from the minute you walk in until you leave.

- Just get the BURGER, almost every person in the restaurant did during my visit! A tasty egg bun, perfectly medium cooked naturally raised beef patty, caramelized onions, cheddar and house sauce. No brainer to add bacon for an extra $2. Easily the BEST burger I ever tried - soooo juicy, PERFECTION.

- Loved the raw plate. Seared Hamachi melted in you mouth.

- Excellent french fries and the home-made ketchup was so refreshing.      

- Although they only had three beers on tap, at least they were good craft beer choices. If unsure, take the Beau's Lug Tread.   

- They know their wine, good selection. The server was making wine recommendations for everyone. 

- Cool laid back atmosphere with a broad mix of patrons.

The NOT so GOOD...

- It's a small restaurant and difficult to get in. No point dropping by without reservations, I failed a few times. If you reserve roughly a week in advance, you should get something.

- Difficult to find, the restaurant is in a converted house with the name written only on the door in small font (but well worth the hunt).
 
A great overall dining experience. The restaurant is slightly upscale but prices remain reasonable for the high quality of food served. Highly recommended.

PS - They will hold seats at the Bar for up to 20 minutes if you call and they have openings. Worked for me.

{"text":"It's anniversary time and you want to take that special lady somewhere special with a dope patio and yummy cocktails.  Where do you go?  Well The Harbord Room is the ticket!  This place is great from the cool NYC style decor, to the super friendly and polite hostess working the front.  I wasn't able to book a reservation, but before I freaked out and thought of the prospect of ruining our anniversary, the friendly hostess told me to come grab a seat by the bar and we could have dinner there or wait for a patio seat.  Phew, that works for me!

The patio looked awesome, almost as if you were having dinner at a friends backyard.  We ordered the Charcuterie Board, Dry Aged Beef Burger and Red Curry Pork Belly.  We also grabbed a few drinks as well, including those outlandish pineapple goblet cocktails meant for two or more people to share.  Food is top of the line and I cleaned up every last crumb on my wooden plates.  Cocktails and drinks were prepared with the love and care of an experienced bartender, which is good to know considering the drink prices are up there.

Service was top notch and what you would expect from a place like this.  You're ordering a $20, burger not a $1.49 extra value pick!  Overall a great experience and I'm sure we'll definitely be back for more.  Make sure to order one of the giant pineapple cocktails to share, they're outlandish and people with stare with envy!  Forget Marvins Room and hit up dat Harbord Room."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Harbord Room, after years of it being on my \"must visit\" list. Prior to going, I asked some people I knew who'd been what I should get. Everyone said get the burger, and a cocktail. So I did!

One of the most tempting cocktail lists I've seen in a long time. Everything sounded great, and I appreciated the thoughtful descriptions. I got the Harbord Cobbler but my eyes kept being drawn to the drink that supposedly tastes like corn on the cob--unfortunately alcoholic drinks with cream never agree with me!

The burger was delicious, and I enjoyed the fries as well. From what I saw on other tables, you can get salad instead of fries. 

Women's washroom top: there is a hook for your purse or coat. Have fun finding it!

Only docked a star for ambiance and service. My dining companion found it loud; and I thought service was a bit absent for my taste. Not just with infrequent check ins but with overall lack of enthusiasm."}
{"text":"I showed up early, without a reservation, hoping for the best.  I'm so glad I did! 

The bartender greeted me immediately and sat me on the patio. I was willing to sit at the bar since it was just me but, walking me out back to the patio, he said it was a beautiful day and with so few left we should enjoy them. 

They have an adorable patio. It's like being in a tiny, perfectly manicured back yard. They made smart aesthetic choices there: wooden benches, small tables painted green, flower boxes built in around the perimeter behind the benches. It all felt very natural and relaxed.

Before he left, I asked the bartender for a recommendation and he delivered. The blueberry/gin cocktail was light, delicious, and refreshing. I'm not a gin drinker, but it was balanced and lacked the piney-ness I dislike in gin. 

The chilled tomato soup was, no exaggeration, among the best things I've ever eaten. I was actually sad when it was finished.  As soups go it's a clear #1. I love soup, but this blew everything else out of the water. It was just outstanding--perfect in its balance, acidity, & flavor. I'd happily have it daily if I could. 

As a main, I had the small portion of the squash gnocchi. They were excellent as well, with a few mushrooms and a sprinkling of nuts and greens atop to enhance the flavor and texture. Not as good as the soup (what could be?) but still delicious. 

The service was friendly and attentive, and my server helped me make the excellent choices that resulted in a spectacular dining experience. This was an excellent way to end my time in Toronto. 

It's a little spendy, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Came here with an other couple at Friday evening without a reservation and got a table on the patio in the back.

SERVICE: The staff were nice and attentive. 

FOOD: We ordered the Polenta ($9) and it was delicious. It had a nice crunch to it. We read that the Beef Burger ($19) was one of the best in the city and it is certainty up there. I ordered it medium rare with bacon ($2). The patty was thick and done to the perfect tenderness. The fries were a little too salty to my taste. 

Overall great value, will have to come back and try the oysters."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. Vibe is hip, room is tiny and loud. Our server lovely, efficient and made us feel young and cool by extension. My husband had the burger and said it was, at best, average. Fries cold. I had Arctic char. It was good but nothing outstanding. I don't normally have a problem with small menus but truly had a hard time finding something I sort of wanted to eat, especially starters and dessert. We ended up with hummus that was as boring as it sounds."}
{"text":"I came to the Harbord Room this past Saturday night, and it was past 10 pm. It is on the same street as Splendido and ICI so that's just a bonus.
From outside, it looked very relaxed and laissez-faire, yet it was still classy. There is also a back patio, which was full when we went so you could tell it's a popular spot..

We were able to get a table immediately and it was cool because i could see the kitchen from where i was sitting, and thus I saw my whole salad being prepared. They said they had their late night menu available, and I proceeded to get the salad but my bf got the burger. Apparently, we had heard that was really good--and it was. He said the meat itself was excellent and well cooked. It came with fries and a side salad.
My salad was just a simple salad. The dressing was mixed in well, not too much but just right. I also had a fruli beer, which i LOVE (who doesn't love belgian beer) and tried one of their cocktails with bourbon which was really good--but strong..

I left Harbord Room satisfied and buzzed...:)"}
{"text":"Juicy, tasty, yummy burger...awesome pistachio ricotta doughnuts...and a great ambience + service
Will be back for dinner!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience here. We can here for my birthday dinner. We got here around 6:30 pm and by 7pm the place was packed. 

I liked the decor elegant sort of and romantic. 

Service was good. Our server was friendly and came to check in on us from time to time.

I got the wild boar ragu with gnocchi, which was delicious. The tomato ragu was yummy, with a good depth of flavour and the potato gnocchi was light and fluffy. They really do remind of of pillows. So soft and yummy. Some of the best gnochhi that I've had.

We also ordered the ceviche. I enjoyed this as well it was nice and light. The taste of the coconut was light and not over powering. The papaya was interesting and gave this a unique twist to the dish. The fish they served with this was a lighter white fish.

My friends got the burger, which was also really good. The beef had good beef meaty flavour. It was moist and I always love melted cheese. There was a good bun to meat ratio. The bun was soft and crunchy. This was served with fries or salad.

I think the portion sizes were decent and I was really full by the end of the meal.

We also ordered the ginger and cardamon cake. It was a nice way to end the meal. The ice cream was delicious the cake nice and moist. I like that the ginger taste was present but not overwhelming. 

I'd definitely be back to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"Just wanted to review a place that I have been to many times before and never written about it.

The Harbord room is simply splendid, the food, service and drinks all come together as one to give the whole experience a 10/10 rating.

I have never been disappointed by the drinks-the owner Dave Mitton definitely knows how to put a drink together.
The food-exquisite.
The staff are all stars and guess what!!! 

I DONT EVEN WORK HERE!!

A must try place in TO. 

Call ahead to ensure you get a table"}
{"text":"A very cute spot. Overpriced but delicious berry mojito, fantastic trout tartare, and bleh simple salad- more dressing please! Soft shell crab tacos were apparently amazing. Dessert was just ok."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Toronto I really enjoyed dinner at The Harbord Room. We had a great spot in the front window and the restaurant has a really comfortable atmosphere. I shared a burger and risotto with my sister and we really enjoyed both. The drink menu looked delicious...and the Lavender Side Car was a tasty treat. They were out of a requested beer, but that wasn't a big deal. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Overhyped in my opinion. Got the burger medium rare, and the meat was very tender and juicy. Nothing else that stood out to me too much though. Also tried the octopus salad which was interesting (lots of different ingredients).

There are a number of things from my visit that would make me think twice about coming back here for dinner:

- I was quite cold while eating because the restaurant is small and the door is kept open save for a fabric curtain that kept opening whenever someone came in or out. Granted, the heaters were on full blast, but we were seated near the door which meant occasional bursts of freezing cold.

- We had a big group and were still waiting for one more. I was seated at the end and the empty seat was to the inside. When the waitress/hostess poured my water, she moved my water to the inside seat saying (and assuming) that I would move in when the last person arrived. Which was not the case because I was going to share food with my friend seated in front of me. I found it offputting that she did this without asking us first.

- When the burgers came, they were different sizes. Some certainly looked bigger than the others. And one of the party's burger bun was burnt.

- They don't split the bill for large groups.

Besides that, our waitress was nice and they got our food out quickly knowing we were headed to a play afterwards."}
{"text":"For all the fuss you hear about their burgers, they're not really that great. Not many places serve medium rare burgers in Canada, so you kind of get desperate for one. This one isn't it. The burger was mushy, the bun was too sweet, the meat crumbled and fell apart and to top it all off the fries were burnt. For $16, it's not worth it, but the ambience, the service, and the other food items on the menu were nice. 

I would recommend Bestellen for that burger craving, so far it's my favorite burger place in Toronto!"}
{"text":"By far my #1 favourite restaurant in the city. Excellent food in relaxed environment. Quality on par with top restaurants in town and lacks unnecessary pretension. I keep going back the burger, but their specials and seasonal menu dishes never disappoint!"}
{"text":"The Hardbord Room has been on my list for some time, and I was finally able to check it off last weekend. Such a cozy little place with beautifully refined, yet rustic cuisine. 
Upon arrival, we had to wait about 10 minutes before being seated. The hostess was very accommodating. 

Our server was lovely - we started with some wine and took some time to decide on the meal.
Arctic Char - really delicate, and paired beautifully with the sauce and side.
Steak - perfectly cooked to medium rare, paired with grilled eggplants. 
Note, if you don't like medium-rare, make sure to let your server know that you want your steak cooked medium/well or whatever. I don't recall being asked how I wanted the steak cooked, but it was cooked to my liking. 
And we got the roasted cabbage side to share. Overall, a good amount of food for two. We were stuffed by the end of the night and skipped dessert. 

I'd love to come back to brunch some time."}
{"text":"Meat lovers rejoice! Today is National Burger Day. Toronto boasts many restaurants with excellent burgers. My favourite burger, in particular, can be found at The Harbord Room. The narrow and intimate restaurant prepares select international dishes from charred leek and eggplant borani with za'atar, pomegranate seeds and crispy pita ($9) to house-made rigatoni with spicy sausage ($17).

However, the dry-aged 'West Grey Farms' beef burger ($19) is the pièce de résistance. Served on a fresh egg bun with sharp cheddar and caramelized onions, the  medium rare burger is juicy, tender and seasoned to perfection. The delectable burger is accompanied with crispy fries and tangy slaw. While it can be quite messy to eat, you won't be bothered, as here, taste is king! 

For dessert, try the sweet brown butter cake ($9) with house-made vanilla bean ice cream and panna cotta, which is perfect for sharing. Service and food are exceptional at The Harbord Room.

{"text":"This is a very nice place to grab a cocktail as the cocktails here are expertly prepared or to spend a night out with friends enjoying a fun dinner. Great, cozy, relaxed vibe here and a plus is that the food is great as well. Their burger is a contender for Toronto's best burger, good quality beef used and (!!) it's paired with a sturdy perfectly matched eggy bun. I'm a stickler for the bun to meat ratio in my burgers and this passes the test quite nicely. The fries are great too but I'm not a fan of the house made ketcup seems a bit too frou frou for me I'll have my Heinz any day thanks. Also I love that they have a selection of Canadian cheeses on hand for a little nibble after dinner. They have a lovely patio too when it's warm out."}
{"text":"A friend of mine raved about this place, the waiters raved about the burger they have on the menu and claimed it was in the top ten in Ontario, we ate a burger and had the PIckerel, - Burger was blanned and had no spices, the ketchup was sweet and bland,  The Chimichuri and other Argentinian selection in spices are week,the Pickerel was over done and didnt take to the lobster sauce. Excellent wine list though, excellent service, very nice atmosphere but will not be running back for the over priced menu."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful and besides going a few times a year, we always go to the Harbord Room for my girlfriend's birthday every December. 

Make sure you do not confuse this place with the Harbord House across the street and just down the block. Not to knock the Harbord House, but it does not have anything on the Harbord Room.

The place can be very busy and require reservations well in advance. Due to the size of the place you might have trouble fitting more than five or six people at a table. And they always have great playlists going.

This is a place where you are safe to order just about anything on the menu and be satisfied. 

The burger, of all things, is particularly delicious and you cannot go wrong with the desserts. They generally have three desserts, all of which are good and they change them up from time to time. I am generally partial to whatever dessert they are making that include valrhona chocolate whether it be the donuts that you dip in the chocolate or the peanut butter, raspberry chocolate cake which was one of my favourites of all time."}
{"text":"I went there for one reason and one reason only. The burger. I've heard amazing things. And rightfully so, it's absolutely delicious. 

Maybe not the best burger in the city (Weezies at King and Parlement is still my favorite) but it's really really good."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here for his birthday dinner. The place was a bit hard to find.  The place was very small and homey. I had their version of the Pimms cocktail. It was yummy with a slice of grapefruit, cucumber and ginger candies. The cocktail had great flavour and wasn't the over the top sweet kind. My fiancé had one of the local craft beers. We started with the octupus salad - I loved it. It was so different and had such a great combination of different foods that worked so well together - olives, whole roasted almonds, crunchy chickpeas, sliced octupus, and a really tasty sauce.  For our mains we both had the signature burger.  It was a really good burger - nice and juicy but not the best we ever had.  Fries were hot and so crispy! Coleslaw was a bit underwhelming.  For dessert we had the ricotta doughnuts with lemon curd, sour cherries, and meringue. The doughnuts were fresh and hot and so fluffy. It paired so well with the sides!  The Harbord Room really is creative with the combination of different foods. I would want to come back to try another entree."}
{"text":"An impromptu weekday dinner with a friend found me here at Harbord Room.  This was my second visit and was utterly delighted to have come here again on a total whim.

Arriving without a reservation, we found ourselves at the bar at the service of the very handsome and attentive server.  Service was excellent - unintrusive and spot on.

I knew we were off to a good start with the chickpea salad. It was delicious with the chickpea sticks offering just enough punch and heat to balance out the fresh citrus-creamy dressing of the salad (or the other way around).

R ordered the burger deconstructed and with a number of particular substitutions.  Try the deep fried poached egg on top of the patty for that gorgeous silky yolk oozing over the meat patty and you have the makings of one uber yummy dish.

For the record, my pork loin chop with side of 'wild rice bread pudding'  was done to perfection.  The outer layer of the chop carmelized to golden perfection, inside done perfectly to a medium well - not to mention the chop was HUGE!  

What a wonderful meal on a chilly winter night... Harbord Room gets my vote every time!"}
{"text":"This E11EVEN is right beside the train station.  We were staying at The Germain (also right beside) and wanted to have brunch before catching our train on a Sunday morning. We tried to call the restaurant at 10h00, 10h15 and 10h25 to ask if we could have a fast brunch but no answer..... The restaurant was opening at 10h30 for brunch. At 10h31 they finally picked up and did not want to take our order over the phone as they said that their system was closed but that they were opened and by the time we would get there, they would probably be able to take our order. When we got there at 10h40, the doors were locked and we had to waive at the waitress from outside to open the door. When we got in, the restaurant was empty and we explained that we had a train to catch and that we wanted to order right away. She then told us that she was not authorized to take our order and that she would send us somebody else.... After a little while, the \"authorized waitress\" showed up. We asked her if it was possible for us to eat within an hour. Answer: I can't guarantee it. There was no one in the place!!  We ended up eating good food and within the hour. However, we felt like we were dealing with governmental bureaucrats...."}
{"text":"Love, love, loved this place, our choice to go was a last minute decision which I will never regret making.  We were seated on the back patio which was very cute, the back window looks right into the kitchen and gives an intimate feeling you're in someone's backyard just find dining, no big deal!  ;) We ordered the calamari to start which was delicious followed by the roast chicken which was unbelievable.  I'm a pretty active guy and eat multiple meals a day however the food at Harbor Room is so good it actually simulated the same feelings of satisfying oneself after a running a marathon.   My applause to the chef, well done!  I should also mention the lead singer of Rush Giddy Lee was sitting two tables down, he's shorter than I had thought, and an hour late for his show at that point!"}
{"text":"Awesome meal. Everything from the octopus salad (best I've ever had), to the Burger and fried, to the spaghetti, to the doughnuts and coffee was beyond good. If you haven't been here you're missing out on  a hidden jem in the city. I'd suggest making reservations as the restaurant is small and busy because of how good the food is. I've already made plans to visit again."}
{"text":"Here's the thing.  My wife and I love this spectacular small eatery for its intimacy and casual approach to high quality food, a refreshing alternative to the still-venerable Splendido across the street.

That said, if I could hack Yelp and delete all the reviews, I would!  The Harbord Room is the kind of place that you want to keep as own your little secret.  We're hoping that success doesn't ruin this gem."}
{"text":"The best service I've felted in Toronto. The waitress was a pro (like a ninja); disappearing the menus, empties, and appearing the dishes so graciously, that it felted like a presentation.

The patio was funny. It made me feel that we were invited to some awkward neighbour's barbecue. They have begonias... A pink plastic flamingo, and a back door. The seats could use a cushion, but I liked the general vibe.

The white wine from New Zealand was incredibly fruity and fresh, zesty, aromatic, and smooth. It conjugated perfectly the salty flavours of the oysters, and exalted the citrus and details of the octopus salad.

I would advise everyone to challenge their palates with the octopus salad. It had extra thin slices of the best octopus I've tried (jelly, smoky, crunchy and fresh at the same time). Piquillo peper, green extra firm olives, chorizo, crunchy chickpeas, arugula, small, bulbs of tangerine or clementines, greens, and a really complex dressing... Sublime 

The raw today was salmon. It looked so coralline, shiny, and clean, that it could be used on one of Anthony Bourdain's shows. Watch out sushi places...

The scallops came with chubby cuscus, rapini, baby neck clams, green roasted succulent chillies!!! And those scallops where magnifique!!!! Extraordinary!!! 

I finished all the fries without regret. Who could resist some perfect hand cut stripes; crispy but soft insides, and home made ketchup/aioli sauce. Nobody wants to feel like a potato without homemade ketchup right?

Want to conquer a girl? Take her for a burger and desert here, don't judge her while she disappears everything, and just watch her enjoying while you tell her you love her appetite."}

{"text":"Came here for the best dinner I've ever had.

Apps:
- Raw plate: fresh and brilliantly spiced with chili oil
- Oysters: good pick, on the creamier side
- Charcuterie board: best meat board I've ever had. The fried egg was surprisingly good. The condiments (dijon, jam, etc.) were outstanding. Our favourite was the (duck liver?
)- Drinks: Tokyo rose & something Yakuza (both really good)

Mains:
- Bavette of beef with a side of Zucchini: Loved it. The zucchini side is a MUST. 
- Daily fish - cooked to perfection

Desserts: 
- Brie & Rhubarb: interesting combination, quite liked it
- Cardamon & Candied ginger cake: simly delicious. Dying for more

Drinks:
we had a couple rounds of drinks including cocktails and wines. I strongly recommend trying a couple cocktails. They may be pricey but well worth it. Tokyo rose was my personal favourite!"}
{"text":"Went late night with the wifey after a long flight back to Toronto. Cool atmosphere, packed with people so we sat at the bar.  Ordered a Mescal Old Fashioned which wasn't on the menu and the bartender nailed it. So good. Also got the red curry pork belly from the late night menu. It was unreal. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place totally live up to the hype. Great ambience, excellent service, and fantastic food! The cocktail menu is full of delicious drinks, you need to order one. The food was amazing, no complaints at all. I was really surprised that the size of the portions, I ordered the halibut and was expecting a tiny filet, but it was actually quite large. Just go, it is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"The cocktails are inspired and outstanding (I can never remember the name of the scotch-based dessert cocktail with infused cream and nutmeg on top but it's perfection in a glass), the food is all bold and outstanding, the wine is well chosen and unique, the service is impeccable. No wonder the place is constantly jammed. My only gripe is this place deserves better than Cava by the glass, but if I'm getting that petty, there really is nothing bad to say about the place. There is simply no reason not to go here if you can afford it."}
{"text":"I had the burger last night with homemade ketchup, fries and garlic aioli. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were able to make a last minute reservation for an early dinner at the Harbord Room. I had been eyeing the menu since identifying this well rated restaurant through a Yelp search of the area. 

The place is small but cozy (seats about 24 but an additional 10 at the bar). Because we were there early, it was nice to have the restaurant to ourselves for a while. 

We ordered the the French lemonade and ginger lemongrass iced tea (but they brought us a ginger Collins drink I later found out through the bill). Both were quite refreshing, with my favourite being the ginger beverage due to the spicy-sweet-citrusy interplay of flavours. 

My hubby ordered the dry aged pork chop which came on a bed of sweet potato purée, roasted endive, and roasted mushrooms. There was a nice sweetness from the purée and the glaze on the pork chop which reminded me of fall comfort food flavours. 

I ordered the flank steak served with roasted Japanese eggplant and yogurt sauce (which disappointingly was cold). The plate was heated so the steak was a bit warmer than lukewarm but I would have appreciated it more had my food been served hot. The beef was cooked rare and covered in a Harissa jus. The dish had a bit of smokiness to it and felt Moroccan inspired. I had difficulty chewing through some of my meat due to the presence of lots of fibres in the flank steak. Overall my meal was just okay, but it left me wishing I had ordered the pan roasted skate wing with cauliflower and brown butter sauce that I had also been eyeing.

To end off our meal, we ordered the basque style cheesecake with a rhubarb compote on top. This was a decent dessert and at least left me with a sweet taste in my mouth and in a more uplifted mood than I had been in while eating my entree. It wasn't the best cheesecake I've ever had but I appreciated the graham crumble and slightly tart rhubarb compote to break up the slightly eggy textured cheesecake.

For $105 including tip for two entrees, a shared dessert, and two non-alcoholic beverages, I would have expected more from my meal. If I return to this place, I would probably stick to something simple and tried and true like the burger or pasta.

{"text":"Although I'm only rating this place 3 stars, by no means am I saying it wasn't great and I didn't enjoy it, I just wasn't wowed for the price I paid. I came here within a group of four and we are all foodies, so we did what any foodie would do and ordered 7 dishes, split everything four ways and got a true tasting of Harbord Room. From everything I tried, the duck confit gnocchi tops the list and the lamb was on the bottom (a big disappointment for me). If you like a red wine suggestion, try out the Bogle 2007, one of the better syrrah's I've had in a while.

Dessert followed and was quite tasty, I would definitely go for the coffee pot-a-creme.... delicious"}
{"text":"Best burger in Toronto! (And for $15, it very well should be.) It's juicy and drippy with meaty goodness, topped with cheese and sauce. Maybe a skosh too much sauce for me, but it was still a motherlovin' fine burger. The bun was rich and buttery, almost croissant-like. The juiciness of the burger does get the bread a little soggy, so I had to eat quickly -- which wasn't a problem for me since I devoured that delicious thing in about thirty seconds. Accompanying the burger was a small bowl of perfectly cooked french fries and a fresh, lightly dressed salad. Impeccable from first bite to last. 

There's a patio in the back which makes a very nice and intimate place to sit on a warm summer evening, though the tables are a little cramped together. The bar/main area is a little more lively in comparison. All the dishes were presented beautifully; the servers were friendly and attentive during my visit. 

Two meaty, finger-lickin' thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Came here for NYE. This place is even better than I remember. I absolutely love the cocktail menu here-ingredients range from home made bitters, flamed orange peel, an amazing selection of fine spirits, and lots of love. 

These are the best cocktails I've had in Toronto. Yes they cost a little more ($12-16) but are worth it not just in flavour, but they usually have ~2 ounces of EtOH each.

The other standout feature about Harbour Room is the service. I always feel welcome, someone takes my coat, and the bartender feels like your friend. Great ambience."}
{"text":"been here a few times and its already been fantastic. there is a small indoor dining room and also a beautiful back patio which I highly recommend! If you get there early around when they open you can get a seat without reservations

The service is very very nice there, once they ordered and brought the wrong entree for me, they re-ordered the correct one for me and gave me the wrong one for free!

For food I tried the fried green tomato salad, the tomatoes were good and it came with some sort of jelly like green cheesy panna cotta which was a bit odd. The warm octopus salad is a great portion and they give a good amount of octopus and not chewy at all. Their potato gnocchi was interesting mine came with charred green onions but something in it gave it a sour bitterness and the dish was very heavy and filling. Last but probably the best is their burgers always juicy!"}
{"text":"My experience of the Harbord Room is nothing short of awesome! I have been here by myself, during a business trip to Toronto. I researched a little and found this restaurant on several sites, it's never at the top spot but I thought it could have been a good pick. Well my instinct was wrong... It's not good, it's AWESOME!
Let's start with the drink menu, a good choice of original cocktails, I have tried one and it was sublime. The bar-lady was soooo great and watching her making the drinks was a real spectacle in itself. 
I had the burgher then. Heavenly. Cooked to perfection, they bread was simply great, hand-cut chips were great too. Probably one of the best I have had in my life. 
I then went for the Brownbutter cake, here maybe they did not touch the same level of greatness as the rest of the meal, but it was a very good cake nonetheless.

Add in impeccable and friendly service and you've got a recipe for awesomeness! 

Will surely come back if I am in town!"}
{"text":"A great brunch day requires several elements. A bright sunny morning. A lazy, slept-in start to the day. A great restaurant with good coffee, relaxed atmosphere and friendly service staff to ease you into your day.

We arrived at Harbord early, 10:30, no wait. Straight to the back patio, sun rays peeking through the overhang trees. Quaint, secluded trellis walls.

OJ was expensive and small. Coffee was brewed well. The burger, (perhaps the best in TO), was drippingly delicious. Just inspiring. The eggs benny served on a crossiant was also delicious. 

Just a great brunch, best in awhile. Too bad the weather is getting colder."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to make it out to this place for quite some time now, and so I was really glad when I had to opportunity with a couple of old high school friends.  The place is actually quite small, and so they didn't have room even on a Tuesday night but we perched ourselves comfortably on the bar.  

We had the pleasure of being served by the legendary Dave.  Dave is quite possibly the best bartender in Toronto.  The drinks he made for me were incredible - made so well and totally hit the spot.  He was also extremely gracious and comp'ed us dessert when the kitchen failed to bring out one of our appetizer orders.  All three of us ordered the famous Harbord Room burger which rivals Marben and Burger's Priest for the best burger in Toronto.  I think I actually prefer it slightly to Marben's burger.

Just based on this experience, I wouldn't hesitate to go back for an impromptu meal at the bar.  The drinks alone are worth it, and then you toss in that burger and this easily makes it into my top tier of favorite restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to meet up with a friend, he suggested this place as it was close to where his class was.  It's a small place that I was surprised was as busy as it was for a Thursday night (10pm!).  It's dimly lit in here so if you have a pimple or feel like you don't look your best fear not b/c your friends will never notice! 

The bar was full but we managed to get the last table.  We didn't order food but had a few drinks.  The drinks are in the $12-15 range so not too bad.  I had the Geisha Sour and the Swedish Royalty.  They both tasted like candy but my fave was the Swedish Royalty - it had clementines and saffron in it and was light and refreshing.  All their drinks have unique ingredients in them (one had sumac!) so you won't find these concoctions anywhere else.

Towards the end of the evening we felt hungry but the kitchen had already closed.  I would come back here to try the food b/c it seems a lot of positive feedback for that so now of course I am curious.  You would definitely need a reservation as this place only has a few tables and I don't think as a large group you would feel very comfortable in here.  It's loud and I think it would be kinda squished.  But for a small group it would be nice."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for my birthday dinner. We had both heard great things and great things were certainly delivered!

The atmosphere is of a cozy bistro, dim lighting, marble tables, et al.

The menu isn't very long (and better for it) and hits all the major marks: meat, pasta, burger, seafood, salad. I ordered the pumpkin gnocchi with a glass of Viognier, and he ordered the burger and a beer.

My gnocchi was the perfect consistency, and surprisingly light for a plate including duck confit. The duck confit was \"melt in your mouth\" tender and the mole gave it a nice smokey flavor. The pumpkin seed added a nice crunch to the dish.

I also nibbled on my boyfriend's burger. Juicy patty with sharp melty cheese? Check! Next time I'm getting one of my own.

For dessert we shared a carrot cake with goat cheese frosting. Have you ever heard of a light and fluffy carrot cake? Well, me neither, but there it was on my plate! 

Overall, I loved the meal and look forward to visiting again (and again)."}
{"text":"I heard about this restaurant for its best burger in Toronto but maybe I expected too much...

The atmosphere was so great and staffs were all very friendly. My friend and I, two girls are in diet so we ordered one burger to share. It was served kindly after cutting into half. 

The beef patty was cooked a little rare so it tasted very juicy with the cheese, however, not that flavorful. I preferred adding more savory sauce. The fries were not bad but homemade ketchup was a great heaven!! I even want to buy some sauce home separately. To be honest, the price was a little expensive for a burger."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. Great, cozy atmosphere. The servers aren't in a rush but it gives you time to enjoy the delicious meal. I also recommend the bursts and beet/carrot salads. Yum!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for tonight... Everything went smoothly. The service was very friendly and inviting. Not snooty or overly hipster-ville either.

We sat outside on the patio which was nice but felt like a walled in back yard. 

We started off with the sweet pea guacamole and chips. Hands down one of the best guacs we've had so far. So much flavor... We even asked for a side of guac with our mains. 

We both ordered the aged cheddar burger. I'm not one for beef or deep fried foods but I figured I'd make tonight a cheat meal and just enjoy it...

After reading multiple great reviews I was expecting this burger to blow me away. While the burger was tasty I wouldn't say it's the best tasting burger in Toronto. 
It's a huge beef patty... and is even a little too thick IMO. There were some areas in the patty that were still pink? It was the same in both burgers. 

The fries were really good but I'm just not a fan of their homemade ketchup.

Word to the wise... If you like ketchup The Harbord Room ONLY stocks their homemade one.

Moral of review?
The guac was finger linkin' good. The burger needed good ol' fashion Heinz ketchup...

I think id only go back if I was in the area"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and this place is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto.

The service is top notch. Everyone is friendly, genuine, and attentive. They all seem to enjoy what they're doing.

The burger is incredible, definitely worth trying. The second time we tried one of their new menu items, the Mushroom Filled Chicken Leg. Amazing, full of flavor - you have juicy stuffed chicken still wrapped in its crispy skin sitting in a really rich green sauce.

Also, don't pass on the desserts here. They're quite delicious! Really liked the doughnuts and chocolate as well as the Pistachio and Olive Oil cake with strawberry sorbet.

My only complaint is that I'm not a big fan of their beer selection. Hope they improve on that in the future. Cocktails is more of their thing here."}
{"text":"The burger is as jaw-droppingly good as everyone says...tender ground Ontario beef brisket, aged cheddar, Guinness mustard, lemon aioli...burger heaven with every bite. I dream explicit dreams about this burger. Plus, Fridays and Saturdays you can get it till midnight--bonus!

Cocktails are also exceptional.

This has got to be one of the sweetest little restaurants in the city. It feels very NYC. No wonder it's a favourite among the restaurant industry people. Last time we were there, we spotted national gossip columnist Shinan Govani a couple tables over...this guy parties with A-listers and knows all the best haunts in Toronto...if you see him a few tables over you've probably come to the right place :)

We'll be back to Harbord Room, again and again and again."}
{"text":"The dry aged beef burger is excellent - very moist and juicy. For a gourmet burger $20 is a good price at this upscale restaurant. Both of us just went in and ordered two burgers haha! The fries are also a must try! Probably the best fries I've ever had."}
{"text":"I came here with my bf for an anniverery dinner. The atmosphere was cozy and the service was attentive. 

We hummed and hawed for ages over ordering a burger on such a special occasion. I reminded him that this was supposed to be \"the\" burger in Toronto.

He got the burger and I got a strange dish involving scallops and pork belly. Boy did I have order envy. It is seriously the best burger I've ever tasted. And I'm not really a burger person. I, like usual, ordered the more \"intersting\" option, and I regretted it. 

We will be back for that beauty again. Promise!"}
{"text":"Despite this place being located right around the corner of where I live, it's impossible to get a reservation there. The one day we got two spots by the bar, we made the most of it. The cocktails were amazing and the giant ice cube just gives it that extra character. The main star, as everyone knows, is the burger and a phenomenal burger it truly is. This place really is awesome. I really have no words."}
{"text":"What I love about Harbord Room is that they create the perfect combination of atmosphere plus fantastic fresh, seasonal, local food, good wine, and great cocktails.  It is cozy and not pretentious.  Prices are comparable to similar restaurants in Toronto and New York. They are also open late serving food until midnight on the weekends which is nice, and not that common in the neighborhood. In the summer they have a great patio which provides much more space, but I haven't had the chance to sit there yet.   Although I've only lived here for 3 months, I'd have to say that Harbord Room may be my favorite restaurant in TO because they just master the whole experience."}
{"text":"The burger is just ok. There are way better burgers. 
That said, the food is great. 
Eclectic mixtures of flavor and texture, good portions, fresh ingredients, creative plating. 
Service and delivery of food take a bit of time as the place is rather popular. 
The raw fish plate was wonderful and the steelhead trout was fantastic. 
Great experience."}
{"text":"We had a great time dining with friends here. After consulting with Yelp, I was determined to try what was commonly referenced asToronto's Best Burger. It was good, no doubt but if that was the best then I've another reason to prefer living in Vancouver (Chuck burger at Pourhouse - dee-licious!).  

Anyway, very intimate and casual setting and I would certainly return to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Recently dined at The Harbord Room. I had not dined there before, or even heard of the place, but happened in one evening after Tiff.

The verdict? The Harbord Room is quite good. 

Before ordering, I noticed rave Yelp reviews for the burger, so decided to try something else. The Ontario whitefish ceviche app was delicious without being heavy. It was a palate pleasing introduction to the meal.

For the main course I had chicken two ways. The chicken sausage portion of the plate was brilliant. The white meat chicken portion was tender and juicy, providing the chicken familiarity I was looking for.

For dessert, the chocolate-peanut butter dessert was decadent.


The highlight of the evening was sitting at the bar. The bartender was helpful, but also a no-nonsense devotee to her craft. The drinks were superb, and the seat at the bar had a charm all to its own.

The Harbord Room may not be the best place in town. However, Grab a seat at the bar, and you may get the sense that The Harbord Room is one of those nicer restaurants you would like to frequent."}
{"text":"We were here a month ago, for my birthday. I LOVE the Harbord Room. We've been a few times - and while not cheap, it's worth it. We had the charcuteri board and oysters. I've had the charcuteri board before - fantastic - especially the pate and the egg - I have a passion for both (to the point of having to resist licking the board itself).
We'd both read so much about the burgers, so decided to go with them. They were good, but not the best I've ever had. I think I'll go with something else next time. Having said that, for dessert I had the lemon curd with the fennel ice cream. The MOST PEFECT DESSERT IN THE WORLD. It's so good I can't believe it's legal! I want to marry it. I should mention that the service is great, I always love the music. Drinks are wonderful (but not cheap). I'll be back."}
{"text":"After a year and a half of seeing the burger lauded in every magazine and with-it Toronto blog out there, I decided it was time to taste the thing for myself. The burger itself was just as amazing as everyone says. The whole thing melts perfectly in your mouth (even though I got mine done medium-well), and the flavors are delicate and comforting. Everything that comes with the burger, on the other hand, was a complete miss. The fries were burnt and middle-of-the-road, the coleslaw uninspired, and the ketchup....wow....I don't even know how to describe it, just weird. It's like they needed to buy a new spice rack so they just emptied the last dregs out of every spice jar and mixed it together into a ketchuppy vat. Way too many spices overpowering each other, to the point that you could just vaguely identify black pepper and coriander. But that burger, YUM. I know, I know, it's boring to like things that are trendy, but this burger is worth it. The ambiance is just okay. It's not as nice in there as THR&Co, and everything feels a bit cramped. But that burger..."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  Staff was very friendly.  I had the burger - very good!  Drinks are inventive.  Coffee Cocktail w/cognac & port and & egg and nutmeg."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto. I've eaten at Michelin star restaurants and in my opinion, the food here is at that standard. The service is warm and friendly.

I've never been disappointed with any dish here, but the west grey farm burger is phenomenal and especially memorable.

I just celebrated my birthday there a couple nights ago with family, and was struck by how consistently amazing this restaurant is."}
{"text":"Amazing Burger. I noticed everyone around me was ordering the burger, so I thought it must be good. It delivered on it's promise. I highly recommend it. The rest of the menu looked pretty good too, but it'll be hard to revisit the Harbord Room and NOT order the burger again..."}
{"text":"We came here for a late night dinner and really enjoyed it. 
We started out with cocktails, which were interesting and really tasty, if a bit spendy.  Partner got a pear cocktail and I got their signature cocktail.  They were both great.  

I realized from other people's reviews that the burger seems to be a big deal, but I didn't realize how big a deal it was until they warned us when we were seated that they were out of it.  First time I've ever been warned in advance that I can't get a hamburger.  Wasn't a big deal since neither of us would have ordered it anyway.   It was pretty late when we ate so we shared a couple of things.

We had the octopus salad, which was excellent.  It wasn't really a salad so much, because there weren't really greens, but it had excellent flavors.  We also had a risotto which was also excellent, a side order of rapini and an order of roasted beet and brussel sprouts.  Everything was excellent.  

Service was also top notch.  The waiter knew the food, was happy to make recommendations, didn't try to over sell us, and made sure that things came out just right.  He was also in charge of the entire room, which was sort of impressive.  

The other people in the restaurant were a bit distracting and the atmosphere was intimate, perhaps a bit cramped even.  

Overall a very nice meal and a great evening."}
{"text":"Amazing.

Charcuterie is outstanding. Fresh, interesting menu. The bartender (Dave) is a true mixologist and has impressive cocktail knowledge.

Go here for delicious food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place gets five stars because I really have nothing bad to say about it. Though it might be more of a 4.5 star place. The burger is really good, though I might not call it the best in Toronto. I prefer the burger at Richmond Station, and Burger's Priest, but the wooden board of the good burger, excellent fries, out of this world house made ketchup, and coleslaw for a reasonable 16 dollars is definitely a dish worth ordering, and I'd get it again. It's really the whole package and is quite satisfying. The star for me is the house made ketchup, as silly as that sounds. I think I might be in love with it. The garlic aioli is pretty garlicy... so if you don't like garlic, you may want to stay away from that.

Everything from the vibe, to the appearance, to the service is quite charming and relaxing. The service is extremely friendly, and they don't push drinks on you. (I'm a just a water with dinner guy). We ended the meal with the ricotta doughnuts, which are not too sweet and have an amazing texture. It came with a chocolate pot de creme which was quite yummy. The desserts for 9 dollars are a reasonable price and are a good size for sharing. I would come back. The place is small so I would make a reservation ahead."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. It's fabulous, everything about it. The decor is unsual and a bit homey and quaint, the rooms are all a bit different and there's even a patio that is breezy and cool. 

My husband and I both had the Dry Aged Beef Burger, which everyone should have at least once when they come here. It is phenomenal, the service is friendly, everything is a little pricey, but you get what you pay for in life. For what you're getting, I think you ge ta bit more than you pay for actually."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! It can get expensive, since there are many delicious things on the menu, throw in desert and wine and you're looking at $200 for two people, but you could also eat for moderately priced here as well. And apparently the cocktails are also fantastic if you're not a wine drinker or want to change it up.

Two of my favourites were the burger and the Japanese tacos. The burger is to die for, it is the best burger i have ever eaten and comes with perfect chips and aoli ($16) and the Japanese tacos ($14) were also fabulous. 

The atmosphere is great, we went with a group of four and had a great night, and didn't need to yell to be heard. It's slightly upscale, but with still a casual feel. It's dimly lit and very cozy. Plus the head chef is known to be gorgeous and often makes an appearance at tables ;) The staff act like a loving family, which helps create a very positive vibe.  Loved it, I will be back.

Note this is The Harbod ROOM, not House, it can get confusing"}
{"text":"if i were on death row, my last meal would be a burger from harbord room -- cooked medium rare, slathered with sharp cheddar & caramelized onions, with house smoked maple & jack bacon -- & an atholl brose, a traditional scotch-based cocktail mixed to perfection by drink-slinger dave mitton that tastes just like an oatmeal cookie. AN OATMEAL COOKIE!

this shit is lethal."}
{"text":"This place has a lovely intimate back patio, definitely first date appropriate.

Limited vegetarian options. I opted for the risotto and found it to be a bit to watery/soupy for my liking. Its supposed to be creamy, not soupy.  

I would probably return here for drinks but not food. They have cider, so I'm a fan of that."}
{"text":"VIBE 
Not exactly why I haven't been here more but after being here about 4 times over a few years, I realized I'll be coming back here much more often. I've been lucky to meet the staff here and they are truly devoted to their craft (without being boastful about it). You know the bartender, Dave Mitton, is loved when there's a twitter account devoted to his beard. 

I ATE/DRANK
I finally was able to eat the burger and it did NOT disappoint. A staple item for sure. Two can split (which I did in my case); next time, I 'm getting my own. The ceviche is top notch; other specials are worth having. 

Pimms Cups and Mint Juleps are ripe for the summertime tasting. It does not get boozier than here and if you request it, the bar will make you anything. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
I need to return more often. It's my kind of \"room.\""}
{"text":"The food is pretty good at the Harbord, deserves a 4 star.  Do recommend the pork chops and I'd stay away from the cod. I give it 3 stars for the following reasons:

1.  It's 30 degrees out and they kept the door open,  flies and bugs are all over our food.  When we told the waitress there are the a lot of bugs, she just ignored us as she didn't hear.  When we left, I mentioned to the hostess and she heard us.

2.  Lacks draft selection with only one.  Mixed drinks are average. The wine list is small basic offering."}
{"text":"Looked around on Yelp/Eater for some recommendations while in town, and the Harbord Room (and the famous burger), surfaced to the top of the list. I did an early Friday dinner and ordered the burger and the Ronald Clayton. The burger was excellent: meat was fabulously tender, and cheddar + aioli = rich + tangy. The slaw was a little less flavorless but nicely cut...but the homemade aioli and ketchup? Best I've ever had. 

Service was super friendly -- in fact, they gave me a list of recs for other places to try. Even if the burger wasn't already awesome, I'd definitely come back because the staff really did a great job of making the experience there so comfortable. You go, Harbord Room!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. Expertly made cocktails, arguably the best burger in town, and a delicious seasonally inspired menu. 

It can be tough to book a reservation at the exact time you want, as there are two seatings per night, so I tend to plan an evening around dinner here and not vice versa.

Great service and ambiance. It's my go-to spot to catch up over drinks with foodie friends, especially in the colder months. Something about it feels so cosy."}
{"text":"Didn't make reservations, and got 1 of the last places at the bar at around 6pm on a Saturday. Got the Village Bay oysters, which were awesome - really nice mouthfeel and not too briny. For the mains, I had the curry pork belly, which I felt was a tad overcooked / too dry. 

Not easy to find parking right outside the restaurant, so be prepared to park in 1 of the residential side streets"}
{"text":"I brought my wife here for her birthday and we were not disappointed. I had there burger with the additional bacon and it was very good. The egg bread was soft and the beef was juicy, perfectly cooked. The fries were well seasoned and I enjoyed their smoked ketchup as well. My wife had the half chicken with grits, and kale. She enjoyed her meal as well, her chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside with a great sauce, not sure of the name. Anyway we enjoyed our time here!"}
{"text":"The BF and I wanted to celebrate our anniversary with some truly amazing food, and The Harbord Room delivered! Initially, we couldn't get a reservation, but were offered spots at the bar upon arrival. However, when we got there, the hostess very graciously found a spot in the patio in the back, but with a 15 min wait. Perfect, since we just made ourselves comfy at the bar, and ordered a round of drinks.

Drinks themselves are expensive, but not exorbitant. With a description \"gentle, beautiful tea notes, yet it carries the ability to knock 'em down quick like a geisha\", I HAD to try the Geisha Sour ($12) and it was fantastic! Egg white foam with rosewater on top, gin + lime + matcha tea syrup. Noms. My man got a manly scotch. The hostess gave us periodic updates ...\"10 more minutes....5 more minutes\", very considerate. Then...we spotted the bartender preparing a HUGE pineapple chalice of drink and decided that's what we're having with our dinner!

For dinner, we ordered Charcuterie Board ($20) to share, Dry Aged Beef Burger ($19) for him and Red Curry Pork Belly for myself ($17). Oh, and a big honkin' copper pineapple chalice full of \"Monkey See\" - pineapple/banana cocktail that seemed to never end. The Charcuterie had lard, tongue/cheek terrine, duck liver pate, chorizo, multiseed mustard, pickled beets and okra, and toasted bread. So so fantastic. It was an amazing way to start the meal, and everything was house made. Highly recommended!!

The burger was absolutely delicious. Juicy juicy juicy! It had caramelized onions, cheese and on egg bun, comes with fries. They also had house-made ketchup...interesting. Our tastebuds are too geared towards Heinz ketchup, so it's a nice change! The pork belly came as a deconstructed dish, with egg crepe, basil, pickled beets and radish rounds. The curry had a good bite to it, and the crepe strong enough to stand up to the curry sauce (aka LOGISTICS!) 

For dessert, we split a brown sugar cake, that came with rosewater ice cream, panna cotta and fig jam. That rosewater ice cream...was so delicate and rose-y. It was definitely strong in the taste arena. The dessert worked best when you have a bit of everything in one bite, otherwise the cake on its own was way too flavourful.

Amazing amazing service, hands down. And that Pineapple punch lasted all through the meal too!"}
{"text":"This burger is not just \"okay\" this burger is off the charts. This is not just a hyped up burger it is perfection.

We made reservations for 530 as that's when they open. We arrived a little bit early but the staff were kind enogh to seat us and let us in from the cold. The restaurant is small and seats about 30. Reservations are highly recommended as we saw some being turned away unfortunately as it was already booked up by 6pm.  Ambiance was nice... has a private club feel. Leather seating. Marbel tabletops. Candlelight. Service was very friendly and helpful. Since were doing the toronto life top25 burger challange we knew we would be ordering the burger.  It is #1 on their list and we've already tried about 6 places including marben, e11even, gabardine, to name a few. 

We perused the menu ultimately deciding that we would get 2 burgers...one for each of us. Usually we share but we thought. ..if this was truly number 1

. ... we may not want to share. 

So we ordered and got a cider and a beer. 

The burger arrived within 15minutes of ordering. It was served on a wooden plank and plated with a generous serving of fries (perfectly cooked and salted), coleslaw (only thing that I wasn't a fan of) and a homemade lemon aioli and homemade ketchup. Both delish. I preferred the ketchup and the hubby liked the aioli more. 

Lets talk about this burger. It was priced at $17.00 plus 2.00 for the bacon. Which of coarse we added. Immediately upon wrapping your hands around it.tip: don't dare cut it in half. Youll see when you pick it up whole and take a big bite out of it. Thw juicy just seep....this burger made of ground beef cheek and shoulder is cooked medium rare anf just how a burger should be. It had the same consistency of marbens burger but double the size. The toppings were perfect!! Salty bacon (note bacon is tasty but flaccid for those who have a preference for crunchy bacon) and cheese with sweet caramelized onions and a grainy mustard.... all brought together in joyous harmony with an egg bun. Seriously. .. the combinations of flavour were epic. Every bite tasted better than the last. And when we were done our meals...we were stuffed.

But we had to finish our meal with a sweet ending. We ordered the ricotta doughnta with the custard.  Super delicious and a perfect light way to end this meal.

We had a lovely evening here and are happy to report that we found the best burger in the city and toronto life was right.

Do yourself a favour and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Much to my dissapointment their burger was not as flavourful as expected based on all these amazing reviews. I find that burger priests have much better burgers. The presentation and the size of the burger was impressive but wasn't blown away by the overall experience."}
{"text":"This was fantastic, every step of the way.

The music was light and airy, the waitress was knowledgeable and the food was immaculate. It had a very homey feel as a restaurant. The mixed drinks were delicious and creative, while they're burger was fantastic. The backyard patio is really cute- would definitely recommend as a good first date spot, or as a place to bring your family. 

I've been here twice, and it was good both times. It's not cheap though- be prepared to separate from your wallet!"}
{"text":"Best \"neighbourhood\" restaurant in Toronto. Worth going out of your way to visit.

An oxymoron, I know.

Quickly becoming one of my monthly must-visits."}
{"text":"We ate our dinner at the bar and thoroughly enjoyed our meals. My girlfriend got a seasonal sausage and I got the burger. It was neat sitting at the bar, the bartender knew her shit. I watched her make a ton of cocktails and asked what one of them was - it had egg whites and a buncha other crap in it. \"Hops and robbers\" she said, so I tried one and it was really interesting! 

Service was solid, food was tasty. The burger was one of the better ones I've had in the city. My favourite part of this restaurant is the ambiance. It's a small ass room with warm old school tracks, and a great feel. GREAT date spot. I'd recommend for a first date place, but make sure you can get a seat because it fills up!!"}
{"text":"Really, really good. The Yelp reviews did not disappoint.

When the server first came over, we mentioned that we were told to try the burger. She checked in the kitchen said there were only two left to which we quickly responded, WE'LL TAKE THEM. It was all-around one of the top 5 burger experiences of my life. Not only was the burger outstanding, but it was served on a charcuterie board with great fixings like house mayo and ketchup.

The cocktail menu was baller. I love places that take the time to be specific about the spirits they're using and add back stories on the drinks."}
{"text":"There are quite a few places on this street with Harbord in their name, so you might want to mind your Ps and Qs and Yelp carefully. That said, if you accidentally popped into this pocket-sized restaurant and cocktail bar, you'd have little to complain about it.

Though they encourage reservations at tables, our group of four was able to walk in and snag a corner spot at the bar for dinner. It's positively plastered in pulchritude inside: large framed mirrors on orange walls, a stunning pop-art canvas (looked like a portrait of Angelina Jolie), and a bar that's made of a 5\" thick slab of hardwood. It's beautiful.

We had to order off the late night menu because it was past 22:30. I just wanted a snack so I selected the charcuterie plate ($13) which consisted of pig's head terrine honey, grain mustard, chicken liver mousse and cranberry jam served with some crustini and breadsticks. I highly enjoyed it, especially the mousse. I also ordered a simple salad which was fine.

They serve some interesting beers here including Krombacher, Beau's and a $20 Muskoka Brewery Cranberry Stout. Yowza! They have an impressive cocktail list too, with detailed writeups of the mixes and contributions by guest mixologists. Neat! 

The service here was kind and bearded. I will certainly come back here for a proper dinner and a cocktail.

Obligatory Title Pun: All A-BORD.

Menu Readability: Possibly the most beautiful menu in Toronto.

Need to mention: They have a patio out back.

What this place teaches me about myself: I need to keep my Harbord spots straight."}
{"text":"Cute cozy spot with fantasic service and food. We love he interior decor as well as the quality of he food. The steak and salmon was to die for and their wine selection is fantastic. The waitress was a sweetheart as well."}
{"text":"When making reservation, I was told that their biggest table only holds 8 maybe 9 max, so even when people wanted to join later on, it wasn't possible since I had to change the meetup date a couple of time already just to get a reservation. Arriving there, I realize that the place was indeed really small with limited seating and we had the biggest table.

This was back in July and was one of the hottest day of the year and I have to say that it was a tad uncomfortable with barely any AC in there
 Sangria $14 
~ pink wine, fresh strawberry & rhubarb juice, a splash of brandy, a medley of seasonal berries topped off w/ ginger ale
~I was still deciding what drink to order when seeing my check-in, Stella (@foodieyu) tell me that the Sangia is a must try and when the most popular food blogger tell you so, you'll just have to trust her on it, given that we have such similar taste. I have to say it is really good and refreshing, perfect for teh hottest day of the year. Probably one of teh best Sangria I had ever had.

 Confessin' The Blues $12
~ Beefeater Gin, Fresh Lime, Mint Syrup, Cucumber & Blueberry
~Joe got this and said it was really good.

Ok, this is a Burger meetup but the foodies that we were; Mary, Grace and me decided to order a variety of dishes to share (see Mary's post here)

Ontario Whitefish Ceviche $13
~ Poblano relish, Tomatillo, Pickled Watermelon, Corn Nuts &amp; Lime
~I love ceviche and this was perfect, not too acidic which allow you to taste the original sweetness of the fish itself. It was super refreshing on such a hot day and even more perfect pair with the pickled watermelon. The combination of all the flavors here just work so well together.

 Braised Rabbit & Red Fife Tagliatelle $20
~ Kozlik's Mustard, Tarragon, Mint, Peas, Leeks, Ricotta Salata & Sour Dough Breadcrumbs
~The rabbit was perfectly cooked, very tasty and moist plus love the strong mustard flavor given that Kozlik's is probably my fave mustard brand :) But if you don't like mustard, please avoid this dish

Naturally Raised Beef Burger $16
~ Sharp Cheddar, Caramelized Onions on an Egg Bun w/ Fries & a Little Salad
~Finally here's the star and the purpose of our visit, the burger that's ranked by Toronto Life as the #1 Burger in Toronto. So everyone got a taste of it (we order total of 4 for our table of 8) and it was pretty delicious with a flaky soft bun, a juicy patty which was served on the rare side. 
~ I try around 10 of the burgers that's listed and I'm not sure I'll rank this #1 although it's super delicious. I find the list a bit difficult to compare since obviously a burger under $10 can't compare to one that's over $15... 
so comparing this with the other higher-end/fancier burgers I had, I still prefer #2 here and #21 here

 The 3 of us girls are the only one who opted for desserts (yes us female food bloggers have another stomach just for dessert) and there was only 3 choices and we still have difficulty deciding.. we end up order 2 to share and they were so yummy that we sort of regretted not ordering the 3rd as well.

Baked to Order Valrhona Chocolate Cake $9
~ Peanut Butter Centre w/ Vanilla Bean Ice Cream
This is a MUST for all chocolate fan out there, the cake is baked fresh with at least 15 minutes wait.
The cake was baked in a ramekin and filled with thick peanut butter ganache topped with candied nuts which had a caramel flavor to it. The hot cake with the cold ice cream can't be more perfect match made in heaven 

Fresh Ricotta Doughnuts $9
~ Espresso Caramel Pot de Creme, Espresso Tapioca & Crumble Meringue Wafer
~ This was pillowy soft, I originally thought that it'll be filled with ricotta but it was mixed into the dough itself but nerverless it was really good especially dip into the pot de creme and the meringue just provided the extra contrast crunchy kick."}
{"text":"I've been hearing great things about The Harbord Room, a quaint little restaurant nestled in a Victorian house on Harbord Street. The house is small, so seating is limited inside, but they do have a very lovely patio in the back. Reservation is also highly recommended. 

It was a very hot day, so I started with a super refreshing sangria ($14), which was pre-made in an individual mason jar. The Harbord Room's version \"starts with some pink wine, fresh strawberry and rhubarb juice, a splash of brandy and a medley of seasonal berries and kiwi - topped off with ginger ale\". Hands down, this was the most delicious sangria that I've tasted all summer long! My only complaint is that I found it a tad pricey at $14. I could almost order another burger with that price tag.

We shared two dishes, the first being soft-shell crab po' boy ($17) with red cabbage slaw, house pickles with tarragon and old bay mayo. Each order includes two mini sandwiches, accompanied by spicy chips. The crab was lightly battered and fried, and the cabbage slaw added a bright and acidic element to the sandwich. Despite the frying and the addition of mayo, the po' boy didn't feel very heavy at all. 

And then there was the naturally raised beef burger ($16) with sharp cheddar, caramelized onions on an egg bun. We also opted to add bacon for an additional $2. My first impression was that this burger was exceptionally juicy. As I was cutting it up, the juice just ran down the knife (always a good sign). We thought that adding the bacon was a worthy splurge, as the slices were evenly fanned out and we got a good chunk of it with every bite. The bacon also provided a savoury contrast to the sweet caramelized onions. But above all, I was most in impressed with the incredible juiciness of the patty, and I loved the way that the soft egg bun soaked up all that beefy goodness! It was definitely a memorable burger that I'd want to have again. 

On top of that, the side of fries were great! Both the accompanying house-made ketchup and aioli were excellent. In addition to the fries, the lightly dressed greens were a nice, healthy addition.

For dessert, we had fresh ricotta doughnuts ($9) which came with a side of espresso and caramel pot de crème, espresso tapioca, and topped with crumble meringue wafer. The texture of ricotta was unmistakable in the doughnut, which arrived so piping hot that I burned my tongue on my first bite. There was a hint of citrus flavour in the dough, which I personally wasn't a fan of. However, my favourite part was that delicious pot de crème! The caramel was luxciously rich and creamy, and the tapioca and crunchy meringue added a delightful textural contrast.

Our waiter claimed that their baked to order Valrhona chocolate cake ($9) was just as good as their burger, so of course we had to try that too! Similar to a molten chocolate lava cake, this one featured a peanut butter center and was topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Rich, indulgent, and decadent, I thought it was worth every calorie! I just wished the portion was bigger! 

All in all, I absolutely loved the food at the Harbord Room- the burger was fantastic and the desserts were sensational! Note to self: must come back soon!"}
{"text":"Yeah it's been great. We ordered the broccoli salad which is creative and tastes great. The beef burger tastes great as well. I noticed that everyone are ordering the beef burger, I think it is some sort of signature dish. We also ordered a pasta, which is a little salty but overall good.

I did not order drinks but my friend did. She said it is nice. For desert we ordered the chocolate cake with white grape sauce and peanut butter, which is nice. We also ordered the doughnuts with lemon zest sauce, that one is great too. My friend recommends us to order the doughnuts with espresso sauce, I think they perhaps changed the menu.

Anyway I think the price is well deserved, and it is close to my home. Nice try."}
{"text":"Came here for our last dinner in Toronto. Seemed like the reservations were fairly hard to come by, so I booked it for a Sunday dinner, and the place was about half-empty when we arrived, but still fairly lively. The place has bright pink walls, but you can't really tell when it's dark out, because of the dimly lit space. The intimate vibe makes it quite a good setting for a date, but the space also is a little cramped, so it's a good thing to keep in mind if you want private conversation. 

Given that we were pretty hungry and eager to try as much as we could (duh), we ordered the stuffed piquillo peppers, the chicken liver mousse, the dry-aged pork chop, and the burger. The piquillo peppers were like your run-of-the-mill stuffed peppers, and the chorizo inside had a nice flavor. The chicken liver mousse was very delicate and really tasty, especially with the crusty bread and sweet pitted cherries. The burger was really solid, and cooked quite nicely, and the fries were perfect. Not quite the mind-blowing burger I read about, but still very, very good. The dry-aged pork chop was probably my favorite dish, however, and the dry-aged flavor was really intense, and you can really taste the difference from regular pork chops.

The problem was that the service was exceedingly slow-moving, even though it wasn't particularly busy. Not to mention, for a very quaint, cozy restaurant, the hostess and our waitress wasn't very warm or friendly, and thus we weren't offered a reason or apology for the extra wait.  Friendliness isn't by any means a requirement when running a restaurant, as long as the service is efficient, but when the service isn't is good, the lack of warmth certainly doesn't help. It was certainly disappointing after reading all the reviews about excellent service at this place.

The Harbord Room does seem like a pretty good place for a casual meal, and the food is pretty well-executed, so I'm inclined to recommend it. It's more like 3.5 stars, but I'll round up because the food was really good. The menu is decently innovative, and I'm sure it's a nice place for a date, but hopefully you get better service than we did."}
{"text":"Visited the Harbord Room last Sunday for a special occasion.  Very easy to make reservations online.  For cocktails, I had the Yakuza and the Ronald Clayton; both were very good.  My girlfriend had the sea bream and I ordered the trout (which was the special). Presentation was BEAUTIFUL and the food itself was absolutely delicious.  For dessert, we had the fresh ricotta doughnuts and cardamon & candied ginger cake.  The service was A+."}
