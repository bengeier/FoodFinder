{"text":"Great espresso machiato and amazing almond croissant, nice and clean interior to chill with cup of nice coffee"}
{"text":"The smoothies are a bit steep at $8-9, but are well worth it. They serve Pilot coffee and it's excellent. There's lots of table and bench space, and the place was nearly empty late on a Sunday morning. Very friendly staff. I'll definitely be coming back to try the food."}
{"text":"One of my favourite neighborhood haunts that I visit almost once a week. Incredibly tasty and hearty salads (the Shredder is my absolute fave) and the relatively recent menu addition of Vietnamese style nachos makes an excellent afternoon snack. There are fresh juices, avocado toasts and frittatas for breakfast on those hangover days when you want to eat something that makes you feel better about your life choices. Very reasonable value when you consider the quality and wide variety of the ingredients (I'm not pickling my own onions on regular basis to add to salads with over a dozen ingredients), as well as getting the opportunity to perch in the sun-drenched, simple, and clean nook on Ossington."}
{"text":"Cozy cool atmosphere with clean menu.  You can tell they care by the details of what's served.  The smoothie was perfect.  The bowl delicious and filling.  Soup, exactly what's needed on a rainy day.  And the avocado toast was the best I've ever had.  The coffee was solid too.  They also have Kusmi tea and juice and other things on the menu that I need to try, the cauliflower tacos and avocado platter..."}
{"text":"Beautiful, airy space and the perfect hot chocolate. Not too sweet, not too small nor too big, with a frothy heart and Belgian chocolate! The server's enthusiasm made it even better. An inspired corner in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"If you like over priced grilled cheeses, and paying too much for salad, this is the place for you. The coffee was ok, but there are better options in the area for that. The servers are super nice, that's the only good point. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Spark is one of the few spots in the Bloorcourt neighbourhood where you can find a delicious healthy and hearty rice bowl and a latte at the same time. I love coming here to work on the weekends as I can eat, drink and work without feeling rushed. Helps that their wifi is dependable.   Although Spark is small, seats are limited but typically you will rarely find yourself not being able to find a seat.   The staff are very pleasant and patient and the presentation of the food is definitely instgrammable if you're into that.   They also have redeemable rewards through Biko."}
{"text":"4.5/5  Had the pleasure of being taken out to Spark to grab lunch and was definitely not disappointed! This place is super cute and trendy. Very fitting for the Ossington area.   Working in Korea town it can get hard to find nice healthy food for lunch, but this place came with glowing recommendations. Their staff is super friendly and knowledgable and their offerings are unique. I was very surprised that we were the only two people eating here at lunch time. More people need to try it out. I hope they can pull it off and be successful.  I had the \"Fueled\" bowl -  a great salad with rice, lentils, roasted sweet potatoes, zucchini, mushrooms, spicy cashew cream, and microgreens. Amazing taste. Will definitely be back for more items!  The Good: 1. Fresh. The food is super fresh and delicious 2. Decor. Very trendy and hip. 3. Staff. Friendly staff and surprisingly the place is pretty high-tech (including emailed receipts).  The Bad: 1. Price. It's a bit pricey for the items and I wasn't completely full afterwards.  I definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"My almond milk mocha was top notch. The service was fast and friendly. The avocado mash on toast was divine. I stayed long enough to want a full meal and ordered to go. The food was fresh, flavorful and healthy. I would highly recommend this cafe spot."}
{"text":"Don't go for the coffee. I've had Pilot coffee from other places and americano was so bitter and nasty tasting that I almost dumped it out and I would have dumped it if it wasn't so expensive. A friend and I both tried it for the first time and had the same opinion. The food looked fresh and healthy but if, and this is a big IF, I go back it won't be for the coffee.  I would expect that a place with the word espresso in the name would have made a better cup."}
{"text":"I came here with my gal-pal Elle R., had the grilled cheese with dates and nuts, and a cappuccino. The coffee was good. The service was hipster light with a touch of yuppie.   They have wifi, the music is not too loud and they are close to the subway, what more can you ask from a neighbourhood Cafe. Especially one that is so happily contributing to the now well established gentrified neighbourhood that is Ossington.     I wish the owners the best of luck. I'll definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"My favourite bowl place in Toronto!You know how at home you can make ~ the best ~ salads and you just *wish* restaurants knew how to do the same?  I've dabbled in other bowls (Fresh, the Goods, b.good) and none of them quite hit the spot. This place usually exceeds my expectations. Some of their bowls are a bit rice-heavy for me, but the beets salad and soba noodle salad are bang on!"}
{"text":"Great new cafe here steps across from ossington subway. It has a very modern and clean looking interior w a hint of hipster. They have great specials daily ex- coffee w pastry for 4.25. Owner is super mellow and chill which describes this atmosphere perfectly. They offer sandwiches and snacks to pair w their drinks and have fairly good seating, my face is the seats along window facing street."}
{"text":"Love this place,  I love the quaint feeling,  mom n pop feel.  At first I thought it was a bit pricey but the quality of the food and choices are just enough to make everything on the menu exceptional.  They are supporters of local and organic.. fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Super cute spot right across from Ossington Station. I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon to get a smoothie to enjoy in Christie Pits. I decided on the Evergreen (banana, peanut butter, kale, ginger, lemon, almond milk, agave, and ice; $9) and my sister decided on the Silk smoothie (orange, apple, lemongrass, mango, ice, agave, and replaced the almond milk with coconut water; also $9) and though they are a bit pricey for a smoothie we could make at home, we both loved them! I would totally go back the next time I'm in the area and want a smoothie in the park."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now.  I've had the 2 rice bowls.  I had the one called Earth yesterday.  I liked both bowls.  The other bowl with the sweet potatoes in it is more filling than this one I thought.  But I love the rice bowls.  I've also had their soup.   The menu is sparse but it's not a big place. And what they do have is very good. So this a place where quality outweighs quantity. So if you like that, check it out.  It's $12 a bowl plus taxes so it's not super cheap either but that is what happens when you buy quality. LOL"}
{"text":"Sweet spot. My size of salads (big) + so much ingredients. SO glad that I find this gem. Cool music, good vibe  the only thing it's that they don't have A/C when I was there it was hot inside..."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, let that be known first.  However, the gentleman who took our order was impersonal and on the verge of being rude."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! I love their evergreen drink. Very peanut buttery and healthy, banana and kale blended with ginger, almond milk and love!   Tried their basic lime salad with shredded beets and carrots, very tasty... the lime added a different and exciting flavour to the salad. I'd definitely pick this bad boy up again.   I've returned for their evergreen drink time and time again and I will continue!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The bowls and salads are huge and full of healthy and interesting ingredients. There are some toppings in the Super Bowl that I've never even heard of, but they all go together VERY well. This is my go-to lunch spot for bowls and smoothies."}
{"text":"We just ordered two bowls for lunch from foodora and the portion sizes had our mouths drop. $14 for a 1/2 a small box full of food. The rice was barely 3 spoonfuls and I could count the amount of chickpeas on my hands. I guess I should have known better with the hipster thing they are pushing but this even exceeded my worst expectations. I had to add my own food to the bowl and offer it up to my friend who ordered from there as well. On top of that, there was no seasoning or dressing or flavour, just a dash of tiny portions in a clich√©d cardboard box. I won't be going back and we have informed all of our colleagues in the office to not even attempt to consider Spark. This kind of poseur overpriced food ideology needs to be stamped out."}
{"text":"Love the bowls here. Loads of fresh veggies and tasty, flavourful sauces. It's a healthy, delicious option when I'm not in the mood to cook.  The avocado toast is killer too! The spicy cashew cream really makes it!"}
{"text":"My recent go-to cafe. Great coffee, nice and cozy atmosphere, the staff I see recently are also friendly and kind.  They use Pilot beans, the type called Monument, which is one of their most classic dark roast beans although usually I see other coffee shops serving Pilot beans use Heritage beans. Either way, they brew it very well! In the summer, I also highly recommend their delicious lemonade.  Their pastries are amazing as well. My favourite is their almond croissant, that's got much cream in it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The Pear Grilled Cheese and the Shredder Bowls are the BEST"}
