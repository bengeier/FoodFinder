{"text":"Great food, friendly service, and fair prices.  We tried the kaftas as well as the 3-pick salads on multiple occasions. Healthy (large, even) portions of salad selection and delicious kafta sandwiches (Bombay for us everytime - really tasty). The environment is very comfortable. Nice people come in and out, many seem to be regulars and locals, finding time to sit, chat, read a book, and take a break from their days.  On our most recent visit, we sat in the sunshine near the window and sipped coffee for nearly an hour after finishing our meal. Bob Dylan was playing for the duration of our stay and I didn't want to leave. Their drip-coffee is of good quality.  This place is right down the road from us and we'll be back again soon. Next time you're in the area and eager for some lunch or a relaxing cuppa, don't pass it up."}
{"text":"Fabulous food! The vegetarian salads were amazing, especially the one with lima beans. Sandwiches were unusual and delicious. We loved everything, and even my youngest kid who eats nothing was happy with her chicken skewer. I don't think we left a single crumb on our plates."}
{"text":"very nice and fast service. Great vegetarian food. Would definitely recommend. Lemonade is to die for"}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious! We were very delighted with the food at omnivore. The don't have a huge menu, but what they do offer, the do extremely well. The food was so flavorful I asked what they used for spices in their rice. The owner graciously told me, but you will have to tho try it and find out for yourself. We were visiting Montreal, but if I lived there I would eat at Omnivore all the time."}
{"text":"Tried Beirut and Omnivore and they couldn't be any better! Also the soup and the lemonade!"}
{"text":"I had the inca sandwich, the djaj and the vege and it was amazing!!! This place is too die for. I live 15-20 mins away and drive all the way there to just have a sandwich, it's that good!!! Try it out, it's a must."}
{"text":"My armenian hubby drags me here.. He loves it! I enjoy lebanese and armenian cuisine a lot but somehow I don't like it much here. Maybe there's a mixture of spices that differ from what I am used to. Lots of vegan choices and I happy with that."}
{"text":"Food: never thought Lebanese food can be so delicious!! Everything was super delicious and tasty, from the meat to all the different salads! We literally devoured everything on our plates, we even cleared the hummus with the complimentary pita breads~ good for our vegan friends as they have multiple salads options, all colorful and diversified~  Service: the staff explained patiently the content of each salad and were very attentive, brought our food to the table!  Price: good portion size&quality/price ratio  Ambiance: funky decor, with wooden tables, tiny spaces though, may be crowded during busy hours. The -1 star is because it felt like -10 inside the whole time!! Euhh heating plz?"}
{"text":"Great food with really delicious and refreshing flavours - especially the salads (orzo!) and kafta sandwiches. This is one of my go-to takeout places - the only complaint that I have is that sometimes I find that the service can feel a bit unorganized (especially when getting items to go). I don't mind waiting ~15 minutes for fresh food - but if the process of ordering, paying, and waiting could go more smoothly, I would order here more often!"}
{"text":"When you walk into Omnivore the atmosphere is without a doubt warm and inviting.  I've always been partial to restaurants on corners because of the abundance of natural light and for this Omnivore does not disappoint.  As far as Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food goes this place is one of the best I've tried in Montreal.  I had the Herbivore Platter which involves selecting any 5 vegetarian items.  I had the hummus (creamy and flavourful with a drizzle of olive oil, just as I like it), stuffed vine leaves, a quinoa and pea salad, a very fresh tabbouleh salad and a wonderfully creamy eggplant and chick pea dish.  I even got some extra caramelized onions because the staff are just that sweet!  They also have amazing smelling grilled meats like kefta which are maple wood charred. I'll be trying that next time.  And make sure you get a fresh juice while you're there.  I had a beet/apple/carrot/ginger concoction that was delicious, very reasonably priced and has probably saved me from a lurking cold virus.  Cozy, delectable, affordable!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered tasted simply delicious and very obviously made with fresh ingredients. Lemonade made inhouse was also a strong favorite. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Efficace et pas cher."}
{"text":"We planned to come here when scheduling or trip to Montreal based on the reviews. I ordered the Roma and the wife ordered the Arez. Both were mouthwatering and fantastic! I didn't give it five stars because there was a long hair in my Roma.......but the sandwich was so tasty I pulled the hair out and finished it.   You'll love the food but eat at your own risk (I certainly did)"}
{"text":"Place très addictive... Leur assiette à la viande est très généreuse et rapidement servie. J'adore!"}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!  We were only in Montreal for 3 days, and located a few miles away, but we made a point to go to Omnivore a few times because their food was well worth it!!  It's a little pricey, but considering the portion sizes and the quality of the food, you can't go wrong.  Everything on the menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent veg options if you want to take a break from meat... 5-option plate is my go-to when I want to do a healthier lunch"}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I am in Montreal ! Food is amazing staff is friendly process is slow but worth waiting for. They charcoal cook the meat so you can go faster then fire!"}
{"text":"First the pros: The servers were friendly and the food was prepared relatively quickly. The hummus and pickled vegetables were good.  The rest: I ordered the Beirut, a beef grilled wrap that came with hummus, cabbage in tahini, and some pickled vegetables; I also ordered a side of tabouleh.  The side was generous portion-wise, but it was really sour and it's not possible to eat that much parsley (their tabouleh comes just as a ton of marinated parsley and some diced tomatoes and onions).  When my wrap came, the beef was neither hot nor cold, just luke warm.  I was a bit worried about this so didn't eat the beef. The whole wrap was not really enough for a meal, and when I mentioned to the server that it was good except for the fact that the beef wasn't hot, he didn't have any response.  Maybe he didn't understand me, could've been a language issue...I left hungry and wouldn't be inclined to go back, however my friends ordered a plate with a bunch of different sides and seemed happier with their dish so maybe if you stay away from the meat dishes you'd be better off!"}
{"text":"Great interior of pots with fresh herbs and wood paneling and delicious, fresh food that is reasonably priced.  We ordered two types of wraps - one with meat, cabbage and carrot and the other with grilled vegetables and pesto.  Both wraps were toasted to perfection and the food was very flavorful.  Whatever you get, I would recommend getting a side of 3 vegetables for $6 - we got the taboule (loaded with parsley), salad du jour and beet salad.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Cozy little place however they warmed up my rice in a microwave a big No-No for me. No A/C but big open window."}
{"text":"Great Taste. Healthy Options. Reasonable Prices.  Omnivore is one of the best, healthy food options on the Plateau. They offer a range of Middle-Eastern fare, ranging from herbivore, carnivore, and omnivore (hence the name).  It's a bit busy during lunch, but well worth crowds. Service is quick, food is fresh, and you're back out the door in time to get back to the office (or wherever). Certainly worth a visit (and taste), whether you're looking for a quick lunch, healthy dinner, or just some excuse to gorge yourself on delectable sandwiches and salads."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, after several days of poutine, terrine, and croissants almondine, it's nice to eat something a little more healthy.  The food at Omnivore is delicious.  We got a vegetarian plate and an omnivore plate (includes meat).  If you have to have meat, it was fine, but the vegetarian items are the stars.    Only dings: no credit cards, no wine license and no BYO."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!!  The staff is incredible, they are all true gems.  The food is great quality and delicious!  I still dream about their vegan wrap and make it a must when I'm in Montreal.  Even being mostly gluten free I will indulge here.  There hummus and baba ghanoush is perfect!  The decor is magical, the plants make the place come alive.  One of my all time favourite spots."}
{"text":"My fave place for lunch...plates can be quite large but tasty but the brochettes are  my go too.  they make amazing hummus too!"}
{"text":"Wow the food its absolutely yummy! We have no idea what kind of food they serve since they're a Veggie Restaurant but what we ordered was great, no issues or complaints at all, they even had someone speaking in spanish so make it all much better."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches and love the vegan options. Very good value for the price! Very small place so hard to find a seat during peak hours but easy to get take out. Try the djaj sandwhich!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Had the omnivore salad, which was good, would have again. They are not flexible when it comes to payment. Wasn't too happy about that."}
{"text":"Homemade lemonade is a winner !!! There is menthe tea inside and other great stuff and the sandwiches is very taste this is One great lunch"}
{"text":"Omnivore is simple and good. Stumbled upon it while walking around our B&B. Prices are reasonable, especially for how fresh the food is. I got the omnivore plate with grilled chicken. I don't think I've ever had grilled chicken as tender and delicious as theirs. The hummus was so fresh and delicious and the labneh was great."}
{"text":"So I've been going to Ibiki for years now and never did I think of ever eating at the neighbouring restaurant that is Omnivore. Why? I don't even know. I thought it was some vegan restaurant. Well, today was the day I finally stepped in. The staff was wearing these dope boxed tee logos that screamed Supreme: love it.  Food was so good and worth every dollar. I had the plate with both chicken and beef. I got to have some salad (in exchange of half of my lentil rice) for an extra dollar. The acidity of the salad is surprising at first but eaten with the hummus and everything else on this plate, balance is restored.  You know me. I love food that is simple. This is simple.  My new go to. Sorry Local Jerk I'll still go there on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Executive summary: exceptionally high quality-to-price ratio.   We went there for lunch and had a herbivore plate (4 salads and babaganoush) and a sandwich (chicken). The salads were tasty and well dressed, not oily at all. The sandwich wrap was very thin and perfectly grilled.    The place is nicely decorated with plants. You order your food at the counter and they bring it out for you. The person helping us was very helpful. The service overall was above and beyond what you expect in this price range.   I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"So healthy and taste just as it looks amazing! Really good food for such a cheap price! It's a big plate and fully. The place is nice and the service is good. Simple delicious. You can choose if you want meet, chicken or just veggie choices. Great food!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Lebanese food at a decent price in this area, and the fantastic thing about Omnivore is that there's enough of a mix of traditional flavours (you know that scene in Ratatouille where the food critic takes a bite and is transported to his childhood? That's how I feel with the stuffed vine-leaves every time.)  But there are also some twists to the classics, with additions and tweaks to the kafta sandwiches that make them Omnivore's own take on Lebanese food that is wholly original. Great people behind the counter, and lovely intimate feel to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious! We have a lot of places like this in NY, but this is amazing! The chicken kebab is so juicy and delicious. The lentil rice, bulgar salad and eggplant musaka were something special. I would eat here every day."}
{"text":"Needed some vegetables and a light meal after eating so heavy the past few days. The babaganoush was the best I've ever had.  The menu was customizable and affordable, if I were a local, I would come here again. Fantastic."}
{"text":"So yummy! Had the omnivore plate with chicken. Would definitely suggest this place for anyone who enjoys Mediterranean food. I also had the House lemonade (not pictured) which was equally delicious. Will definitely eat there again if I come back to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Montreal is a treasure trove of international foodie jackpots such as this one. The ground Chicken Kebab/Brochettes here is easily my favorite dish during our week long trip to Montreal!  In the Omnivore version, it is served with a side of salad, hummus, and rice. It was so delicious that we decided to  pack the wraps for the plane on our trip home. We also packed the Hummus and Baba Ghanouj but they were confiscated at the airport! Thank God they spared the kebab wraps as they were the most perfect bites ever!"}
{"text":"This place is a Montreal staple - if you live here and haven't been, get your omnivore on NOW! The food is simple yet full of flavour. It's quite affordable and has an ultra cool rustic garden inspired decor!  It's small but cozy with a cafeteria style!  I recommend the mango chutney and Hummus!"}
{"text":"Nous sommes arrivés là par hasard en marchant sur la rue Saint-Laurent. Ça semblait sympathique et des options végé étaient affichées au menu.  En entrant, un comptoir de salades, à la fast food, nous accueille. Les assiettes végé sont un combo de 3 ou 5 \"mezzas\" (a.k.a. entrées ou salades). J'ai choisi une salade de quinoa, un couscous, un plat d'aubergines, un plat d'okra, et une salade de betteraves avec un jus de pommes fraîchement pressé. C'était pas mal bon.  Le resto lui-même était bien (même s'ils auraient pu installer un climatiseur, ça aurait fait du bien, surtout en cette journée où la température est montée jusqu'à 39). Le service était un peut trop bête à mon goût."}
{"text":"Simple, incredibly tasty and definitely worth coming back!  Ventured here after seeing good yelp reviews in search of middle eastern food - the place delivered and exceeded expectations. It's a simple no frills type of place with tasty delicious food and generous portions. I got the thai sandwich and the sauce was to die for ! My hubby and his friend got platters and everything was incredible !   Yum, yum and more yum ! Can't wait to come back on the next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! I come here all the time! Never disappoints, always fresh, always amazing, always satisfied"}
{"text":"Shut up and take my money.  What a gem! DELICIOUS coal-grilled kafta wraps/sandwiches for $5.50! Wonderful selection of salads and all the delights any vegetarian, pescatarian, omnivore and carnivore could desire.   Great and friendly staff.   Rating Scale: 1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.   2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one? 3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch. 4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible. 5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"No frills healthy food. This is my go to restaurant when i want cheap healthy and flavorful food. My fav is the sammac and vegetarian sandwich. Love the ambiance. Their fresh juices are very good too."}
{"text":"Freshly cooked grub in a cosy oasis on st. Laurent. I got the omnivore it came with good baba and better hummus. I've had better beef but overall it was really good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite while doing some shopping in the plateau. Cheap, delicious and filling. My favourite combination of words.   We had the veggie sandwich and the fish sandwich and both were delicious at only about $6.00 ea.   Would return!"}
{"text":"While walking around in Montreal on our anniversary my wife and I were looking for something new to us. When we came across Omnivore on Yelp we knew we had found the right spot.  A Mediterranean restaurant that offered a wide variety of food to offer we knew that we were in for a treat.  When approaching the restaurant, you first notice the windows have planter boxes filled with different herbs.  This led me to believe that they focused on ensure that the food was fresh.  It turns out that is exactly what they do.  The several different types of salads and pastas they offer are all made fresh every day. In addition, they make all their ground meets for their different dishes in house as well.    My wife and I ordered and then sat down at a table.  When the food came out we were both extremely happy.  I got the carnivore plate because, well, I love meat.  It came with two beef and one chicken skewer.  Both of which were incredible. The fresh herbs mixed into the meat along with the seasoning used made them extremely flavorful. The rice and lentils it was served with were a perfect side to the meat.  The hummus was unlike any hummus I have ever had.  It was clearly house made, which is not a bad thing, and had a little bit a tang to it.  Taking a bit of one of the meats with a pita that had hummus on it perfect.  Clearly the cooks knew what they were doing when it came to making delicious Mediterranean food.   Overall Omnivore is a great restaurant.  Like many great restaurants in Montreal, you may walk by it without realizing it.  But trust me, if you stop in and grab a bite to eat you will be extremely happy you did so."}
{"text":"Good food. Great staff. No booze. I like beer with this type of food. Food was fresh. Quick service. Great location"}
{"text":"So happy that my wife and I gave omnivore a try this time around while in Montreal. We were specifically looking for some Lebanese style cuisine - and we definitely chose well. I had the Beirut kafta sandwich, she had the Inca. The meats were super tender and very flavorful (the bags of charcoal can be seen lining some of the walls).  The staff was also very friendly, which is a plus - it's probably the effect of smelling all the wonderful food all day. Get a window seat and enjoy the awesome food!"}
{"text":"My father and I were thinking about some healthy food after we ate a lot of meat and sweets that day, so we came to this place. I have heard a lot about it. The place is not big but I liked the atmosphere. I ordered a three salad herbivore and my father ordered a beef omnivore. They were both very delicious. My father was not used to non-Asian food, frankly speaking, but he seemed to like the food here, especially the hummus."}
{"text":"I was very excited to eat Lebanese food when we found this place on Yelp. We ditched going to Schwartz's and headed up the street.   The girl behind the counter couldn't have  been nicer and the Beirut roll with salad and lemonade was very tasty. I'd have eaten two.   So why the two stars?  After we ordered and took a few bites of our food, I started looking around on the walls. There are about 5 very anti-American pictures on the wall. We are American.  We are from NY.   I can't say that I don't support the right of free speech, bc I do.  And I can't even say I voted for any of the presidents depicted so poorly bc I didn't. I won't try to put myself in the shoes of people from the Middle East, I can't.   But I can say that I believe the first job of a restauranteur is to make your guests feel welcomed and that is obviously not a goal here. I would not go back there and I would not give them my money any more than I'd give an American establishment my money if they dipicted Lebanese as terrorists.  Hate is hate and there's enough hate in the world already. What  I love most about sharing food is it brings cultures together and makes differences disappear."}
{"text":"I live not very far from Omnivore, so I have been there at least three times over the past year (last time was yesterday). I go there when I want a fast, tasty, affordable, and healthy meal. On the Plateau, that's the best place I found so far to get that kind of meal.  The food is really great; I enjoy middle eastern food for the subtle mix of flavors within simple dishes like a pita sandwich or a salad. I usually have the inca sandwich--I like it so much that it's hard to order something else. They also have salads; the quinoa/green peas and the rice salads are the ones I tried and they are delicious.  They write that their meats are from animals raised locally and without antibiotics. I have not verified this information any further, but I am always in favor of sustainable foods.  The place itself is very casual and cozy: wooden tables and middle-eastern decor. It's not very big, but we never had trouble finding a little spot to sit there. The one thing I like a bit less is that they don't take credit cards (only cash or debit). This is probably why they can keep their prices so affordable, though."}
{"text":"We got several sides: baba ganoush, hummous, tabouleh, and pickled veggies plus the Inka Kafta and the Khodra Kafta sandwiches. The sandwiches were not what we were expecting but better, wrapped and grilled yumminess. Everything tasted very fresh and healthy! Cheap prices, too.  Homey little corner restaurant. Our first server was great, the second didn't hear what we said but insisted that he did. Despite him, it was delish."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the beautiful friendly vibe from those that worked there. We were a party of 16 ( came down for the African festival ) from New York. We all had various dishes and believe me when say EVERYONE was satisfied and happy with the tasty food and the EXCELLENT service..The whole staff totally rocks!!! Prices are very reasonable and food is better than a lot of those over prices \" chic\" type restaurants..."}
{"text":"Omnivore is a good place to get some Libanese food. This is simple but good food!"}
{"text":"My hubs and I stopped in for lunch and got an awesome, affordable, vegetarian meal.  They had a wide variety of options - I think we tried 4 or 5 different things. I can't remember exactly what the salads were called that I ordered, but they were all really tasty.   Seemed to be very popular with the local 9-5 crowd for lunch too, it was a little tough to find a seat.   Highly recommend for anyone looking for a lighter meal!"}
{"text":"Great little spot. Cozy, yummy, great menu. Fresh ingredients. Chicken was grilled perfectly."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant, cool-rustic interior, chalkboard menu full of delicious Mediterranean inspired eats. Serving sandwiches or plates at inexpensive rates, everything is fresh and mouth-watering.   I ordered their newly added Bombay sandwich, which is made with chicken kafta, sweet & spicy mango chutney, and other amazing fillers that make this sandwich an explosion of flavours with each bite."}
{"text":"The entire place has a rustic atmosphere, cozy and comfortable. Could use some better AC!  All the wraps are a bit small in size, so I recommend buying two or sharing a full dish!  The chicken is especially well seasoned, rich in favour but not too dry. Their pickled beets are absolutely heavenly, crispy, salty, and cuts through the creamy sauces."}
{"text":"I wanted to eat something lighter after eating out for the whole day so I went to omnivore to get some hearty vegetarian options.  I ordered the Herbivore option and chose the cauliflower with cabbage, okra, and beets salad. Each one was seasoned very differently and I didn't feel bad eating these because they felt very light and healthy, almost cleansing. Loved it. One mistake we made was that we forgot to get our food warmed up so we ate cold food on a cold night. Oops. Still no regrets!  Great healthy food for great prices."}
{"text":"La nourriture est excellente, très bon rapport qualité prix. Les personnes y travaillant sont tres sympathique et souriante. Je le recommande vivement !"}
{"text":"Sweet little spot with nice veggie options - perfect for lunch or a quick dinner. My only request? Add grilled halloumi to the menu!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I agreed this was the tastiest (and least expensive) thing we ate in Montreal. Fresh ingredients, good balance of veggies and meat, and super flavourful. I had the sandwich combo which came with an awesome fattoush salad. Tangy, delicious dressing. The sandwich was not really a sandwich, but more of a kebab wrapped in a grilled pita with pickled cabbage. I've never had anything like it, but it was really tasty."}
{"text":"Location: On the Main. Street parking only.  The place: It's tiny and for reasons unbeknownst to myself, it reminded me of a jungle shack. Have I ever been to the jungle, you ask? No I have not but I'm sure that's what a jungle shack would look like. Very cozy with lots of warm brown colors. Also, the smell. Nom nom nom. All I'm going to say about that. Oh, and great tunes in the background. Anyone who plays Dylan is all right by me.   The food: Their specialty is Middle Eastern cuisine that they prepare fresh on a daily basis. Their selling feature is that maple charcoal grill - it makes everything good and tasty! I ordered the fresh beet/apple/carrot juice and the Bombay wrap. The juice was a great little energy boost, and I could really taste the beets and carrots. The Bombay was to die for. It consisted of grilled chicken with pineapple chutney, sumac onions and red cabbage cozily tucked into Pita bread. AND it was so damn spicy I could feel my sinuses expanding as I ate. LOVE it. Flavor-wise, I would define this as an explosion of deliciousness. Need I say more?   Service: Great - the guy behind the counter is a little serious but he knows how to make a mean sandwich so I'll let that go. The clerk who brought us water and rang us up at the cash was super friendly.  Price point: Pretty good - for $10 I had the wrap and the juice."}
{"text":"Yumnesssss! I don't have words for how delish the food is here. I got the combo and loved both the Bombay sandwich and salad :)"}
{"text":"Petit resto de coin de rue coloré goûteux et peu coûteux. La salade fatouche est épicée, texturée et variée, le kafta beirut que j'ai pris est un pita au boeuf aux épices et à l'humus servi dans un format allongé intéressant. Vous ne pouvez pas vous tromper avec leur menu. L'accueil est sympathique aussi, ce qui est toujours un plus. La limonade maison est légèrement parfumée. À essayer"}
{"text":"This place has the best kaftas and side salads one can ask for. You can't miss with anything from their menu. After eating here I'm in love with Quinoa!! I can become an vegetarian if I only eat their salads for the rest of my life!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently fantastic wraps... if you know Montreal think upscale, refined Boustan. Great vegetarian sides if that's what you need. Get the djaj, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here 2 years ago during our first visit to Montreal and we absolutely loved it! We had such an amazing experience with the delicious food and excellent service that we had to come back during this vacation. We ordered the exact same dishes - Omnivore with chicken and Carnivore with beef. 2 years later and the food is still incredible. Also, they give generous portions with a side of pita bread for free. The staff here are so friendly and are really attentive; our server checked in on us several times and constantly refilled our water cups and pita basket. We can't wait to eat here again during our next visit!"}
{"text":"YUM! I love Mediterranean food and have been wanting to try Omnivore since I moved to Montreal. What I really wanted was the Ominvore platter, as I love to be able to try many different things with my meal. However, I had a late lunch and didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I would if more hungry.  Instead, I went with the Djaj sandwich - a very traditional wrap with grilled chicken, garlic sauce, turnip, and pickles. It was fantastic! The portion size was perfect and all the flavours went really well together.   As I waited for my sandwich for takeout (which did take a little while), I got to see all of the other wonderful things people were ordering! The various salads looked amazing, as did the Omnivore dish.   I can't wait to come back! The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice and, given the wait time, I will probably plan to eat in next time."}
{"text":"My first meal in Montreal - don't judge me because it wasn't French. I was craving Mediterranean food and the Beirut Shawerma popped out of the menu and slapped me across the face. If you like shawarmas, you will respect and appreciate this one. It has the right consistency of pickles, hummus, veggies to meat ratio. I love the fact that they tightly wrap it and finish it off on the grill. I am sure I will be back a few more times during my stay in this lovely town."}
{"text":"This was such a delight!  Walked through the snow and blizzarding cold to get here and fine anything but disappointment! I got the Thai sandwich with the most amazing peanut sauce I have ever tasted! The house salad was splendid with a great dressing and flavorful veggies! In addition I had a side of baba ganoush and hummus which were both so flavorful! What a great vegan find!!!! Can't wait to be back in Montreal to give this place a visit.    Note- for international...cards don't work but they have an ATM inside:)"}
{"text":"Ok food at a reasonable price. Some of the dishes were a bit too oily for our taste and some vegetables looked dry as if they had stayed behind the counter for a while too long, though the taboule was quite good. The staff was very friendly even though they did not speak any french."}
{"text":"I can be pretty picky about my meat...but that charcoal goodness worked its magic! Sandwiches usually bore me to death but the concoction of veggies and meat that they place together were pretty nice on my taste buds. The menu here definitely has a place for both vegetarians and meat lovers -- (staying true to the name of the restaurant!) This was probably my first encounter with Lebanese food and I have to say I was pretty impressed.   In terms of price point, it is pretty student budget friendly. Most things seem to stay around the $10 - $15 range.   You get a tropical vibe from this place. A lot of wooden decorations and greenery. Very easy on the eye and homey."}
{"text":"So after having been here several times since the last review, I'm updating my rating to 5 stars! This place is consistently great. How can you go wrong with an amazing kabob sandwich, homemade lemonade and fresh made fattoush for 10 bucks!  LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and it lived up to everything i had read.  We both had the omnivore plate with chicken and both the kofta and cumin chicken were full of flavour. The hummus was some of the best i have tasted and the salad and lentil rice were great too. If i was staying in Montreal longer i would be back frequently."}
{"text":"Stunningly good snack food. I got the fish sandwich, and it was really amazingly flavored. The house lemonade has maybe mint in it? Totally delicious.  This is definitely THE place to get food while wandering aimlessly along Saint-Laurent."}
{"text":"Best experience and food I've had in a while. Never felt so welcome into a restaurant- which helped a lot as a visitor to Montreal. The staff was really friendly and helpful and did everything with a smile.  The food was really good. I had grilled chicken plate with orzo. Everything was incredibly tasty from the salad to the meat. The best part was surprisingly the yogurt, which tasted unlike anything I've ever had. Great place"}
{"text":"Ordered the vegetarian plate with 4 salads and babaganoush and it was very large and very delicious! If I lived in the area I would be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Nice ladies in there taking your order and serving BUT for Mediterranean and Lebanese go to Boustain on Cresent St. This place was like eating grass and grass-like mixes. Overly healthy but not overly tasty. A bit overpriced...if you want meat...they will only provide a small amount (which was the best part)."}
{"text":"I thought it was overpriced but the food was good. The place is small but it felt cozy, despite the fact that we didn't have a table at the beginning."}
{"text":"A pleasant little tavern with pretty good wraps. \"Beirut\" is my favorite. Their meat is certified organic, which makes the whole concept even better. Too bad they don't serve beer. Anyways, I wish we had more places like Omnivore on the plateau."}
{"text":"I was craving vegetables after too many days of bagels, croissants, and poutine. Omnivore was the perfect place to satiate that desire and I also had the chance to walk down memory lane (but it was even better than the original) with a fabulously garlicky, satisfyingly crunchy (thank you, turnips) shish taouk sandwich. As so many others have said, the menu is set up very well so that you can include some vegetable and some meat options, add in some fragrant, soothing mint tea and you will be very happy at the end of the meal.   We were a group of five and so decided to to order the plate of 5 vegetarian mezza for $10. It was well worth it as we had a heaping platter of hummus, lentil-studded rice, moussaka, sweet potatoes, and orzo tossed with toasted pine nuts and dried cranberries. Supple triangles of pita were served alongside and I quickly stacked mine with all the veggies that I could cram inside. Bliss.   On to the kafta sandwiches: the Djaj is a \"Classique\" version of Shish Taouk except that it's a longer, thinner presentation and the quality is much higher than at the storefronts I frequented on St. Laurent in the mid-1990s. Ouch. It hurt to so blatantly acknowledge the passing of time. But I'm eating better food now, right? That must count for something. I also tried the Inca, which again involves chicken but also some crunchy tahini-laced cabbage. Star of the sandwich right there.   There were so many options that I wanted to try - I will return!"}
{"text":"There was not a thing on my plate that I did not love. My husband felt the same (see photos). I got the omnivore & my husband got the carnivore. I highly recommend the roasted carrot salad. It's fabulous."}
{"text":"I had the Inca \"sandwich\".   I say \"sandwich\", but it is really a \"wrap\" of sorts.  Well, call it a sandwich or call it a wrap, but whatever it is it was phenomenal.    The mix of flavors along with a perfect texture and feel, just made we want to say \"oooh that is good\" with every single bite that I took.  I didn't try anything else, but the Inca get's 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Husband and I love coming here atleast a few times every month!!! Food, service, vibe is always perfect every single time!!"}
{"text":"Mon restaurant sur le pouce parc excellence. Essayé le sandwich Beirut et la limonade maison. Bon service et excellente nourriture!"}
{"text":"C'était un de ces soirs où je n'avais pas l'énergie de cuisiner. J'ai donc décidé de m'arrêter chez Omnivore pour un repas à emporter; c'était nouveau pour moi et pas cher en plus! Plusieurs options végétariennes, j'y suis allée avec le Kafta végé, la salade de patates douces et la salade d'orzo. Le gars derrière le comptoir était super souriant malgré l'avalanche de commandes à préparer, et pendant que j'attendais la mienne j'en ai profité pour observer les lieux. Ambiance relax, c'est tamisée, un peu rustique, mais surtout, c'est petit. Dommage, parce que j'aurais bien aimé revenir avec un groupe d'amis! Finalement arrivée chez moi, je déguste un repas savoureux: C'est original (je n'ai vraiment pas l'habitude de manger de la nourriture libanaise!), et les saveurs sont parfaitement balancées. Aucun remords à la fin non plus, parce que c'est le genre d'endroit qui évite les quantités monstres d'huile, ça goutait donc léger et bien frais (mais ne vous détrompez pas, j'étais bien pleine à la fin!).   Environ 10$ Tip inclus pour un beau gros repas original, c'est gagnant. Le seul bémol est l'espace pour manger sur place, alors je recommande de prendre pour apporter (ils livrent aussi! woohoo!), quoi que ça peut faire un resto qui sort de l'ordinaire pour une date..!"}
{"text":"Ate here more than once with my girlfriend or with friends while in Montreal.  I love the creative selections; very healthy and tasteful cuisine.  It's also on a nice corner and has a great vibe/ ambience.  Memorable meals here, for sure.  And I actually am able to get enough food!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Friday night. It was busy but not crazy and this place is a fast casual type environment. You order and pay up front and they bring the food out to you once it's ready.   We ordered the omnivore with beef and I got the carnivore with beef and chicken. The platters came with hummus, eggplant dip, and mine came with the garlicky dip too. Boo Boo's platter didn't come with the garlicky one.   Hands down this place our dinner was the best food we had this short trip in Montreal. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We also more pita bread without having to ask for more at the front.  Credit card accepted"}
{"text":"I had the Thai wrap, which was very tasty with a good level of spice. Maybe a bit too much sauce, though. It was a messy but enjoyable snack."}
{"text":"Order at the counter. Simple menu: plate or pita sandwich (any of which can be made vegetarian), or combo - sandwich with a salad/soup and a drink.  Came for dinner. My friend and I both ordered a combo, she with a side of salad and myself with a soup. Food is good, portions are filling.   The place is rather small, seats about 20 people, but good vibes all around."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Montreal. Amazing food in a low profile quaint setting. Don't leave Montreal without trying Omnivore if you like Mediterranean cuisine. We probably ate here on 3 of the 8 days were in Montreal for!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I don't think I would go for dinner, but it's a great place for lunch. They had an interested variety of tasty things behind the counter. I would return."}
{"text":"Food was good. I can see the charm in this place, but it was very cold (it's a small place so whenever someone opens the door, a gust of wind hits you-I did go on a cold winter day). I think that the sandwiches are overpriced, but that being said, the food was good."}
{"text":"Ok, fair warning: this place is FREEEEZING in the winter. Even with the heat cranked, it's so cold that you won't see anyone dining without winter coat still on. The problem? Huge, beautiful front sliding windows with NO insulation. Great for the summer, but... They have delicious homemade lemonade with rose water, but I'd recommend getting tea to help keep you warm. Yes, it's that bad.  My date and I had two kinds of kafta, a traditional Leb sandwich, but my Lebanese-Cypriot manfriend said they aren't really prepared traditionally but like more of a fusion for North Americans. The kibbeh was very good but I had to agree that the kafta did leave a little to be desired. I tried the Inca and fatouche combo. Fatouche was really good.   Honestly, I've had better Lebanese food not far from this spot. I'm sure it's a great summer hangout, though!"}
{"text":"Yum! Honestly one of the best meals I've had in the resto for a while! Omnivore is located centrally in the plateau with quirky decor. While the shop is small, the ambiance is maintained nicely nonetheless. You have to order at the counter and the waitstaff brings you your food; you pick your own seating. Luckily, the night I went it wasn't too crowded but the seats are located pretty close together so it could get kind of awkward with the intimate seating (conversation wise). The omnivore beef plate was very tasty and the salad was amazing! The sweet chips in the salad really made the entire dish come alive. I will come back to try more menu items! Also they don't take credit card so it's a little inconvenient but won't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"It's my first Yelp review in a while since I was super busy over the past one and a half months! So technically I should've written it at that time, but s--t happens sometimes haha. Omnivore has been on my list of must-try restaurants for a while, but it was definitely worth the trek in nearly -20 degree weather to get there.  I ordered the omnivore plate while my friend got one of the pitas, and we both got their homemade lemonade. It was very refreshing and not too sweet, but it wasn't overly sour either, which is exactly how I like it. The omnivore plate was seriously foodgasm-worthy, and everything about it was perfect. The grilled chicken was juicy, the rice had just the right amount of bite to it, and the salad with toasted pita pieces in it were all exceptional. I tend to notice a pattern in which the restaurants I like best often make really tasty salads, and that's coming from someone who normally isn't a huge fan of them. My friend said that her pita was really good as well.  I also decided to order some sort of coconut cake-esque dessert. Dense, moist, and definitely doused with some honey, it was the best way to cap off an already amazing meal. It's better and healthier than Boustan, and I will be sure to come back again in the near future!"}
{"text":"Healthy and delicious :3 And wonderful serving sizes too"}
{"text":"Fabulous tabouli, and beef kafkas. Really good hummus and pita. Prices can't be beat - this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I liked the earthy feel of the decor in this restaurant. I ordered the beet/apple salad and the Samac sandwich.   The first to the last bite of the beet/apple salad was purely wonderful. So light and refreshing with subtle flavours bursting in my mouth with every bite. I wished it was an endless plate of that salad.   In contrast, I found the Samac sandwich fishy on first bite (and yes, I know this is a fish sandwich), but it was a distinctively really fishy taste... not in a good way. However, as i took more bites and enjoyed it more and more when the other ingredients in the sandwich kicked in."}
{"text":"This place is great! Perfect balance for my meat eating husband and loads of veg options for me. Such friendly staff and great art collection up. Try the lemonade!!!"}
{"text":"Well, just about to complete my first trip to Montreal and one of the highlights was Omnivore!  The food was fast, fantastic and fresh!  It was my first experience with Lebanese food and I am soooo hooked. I tried several things from their menu (buying extra to have available in my room) and loved all of them.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  What a wonderful and yummy experience.  I am so happy I wandered into their restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a small lovely restaurant in the heart of Plateau area, they do also have a mini grocery store which is 3 mins away by walk. What can I tell? This restaurant offers you a healthy looking plate with high end quality ingredients! I passed by and ordered the omnivore plate which came back for 13$"}
{"text":"WOW! Found this healthy amazing spot on St-Laurent in #Montreal called Omnivore. Think upscale, refined Boustan. Boy, they impressed me. A cuisine mix of Lebanese, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Vegetarian-Friendly. The menu varies from herbivore salads to carnivore and loads of great yummy vegetarian options. Everything we ordered tasted simply delicious/exceptional and very obviously made with fresh ingredients. I would eat here every day. Lots of food for your money! Wishing them THE BEST :) ** I couldn't resist to post about them and take a pic with the awesome staff member Hadi Yazbeck"}
{"text":"Cute little place to grab lunch and just chill. The vegetable sandwich was delicious. Would definitely recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Ce sont les meilleurs sandwitches en ville et je ne savais pas qu'on pouvait faire des salades qui goutaient à ce point le ciel.  La seule raison pour laquelle je ne donne pas 5 étoiles est que le service est très long aux heures de repas.  These are the best sandwitches in town and I didn't know that these heavenly salads existed before I entered Omnivor for the first time. The only reason why they don't get 5 stars is because the waiting time is long around meals."}
{"text":"This place was a breath of fresh air. I love finding inexpensive, quality healthy meals, and this place is all of the above PLUS gracious and patient staff. I don't speak very much French and I was so grateful that they started speaking English to me when they picked up on my accent. In a helpful way, not in a snooty way. ;) The food is fresh and delicious; definitely my favorite meal in Montreal. In our 3 nights stay, we came back here for another dinner. Another note: we usually keep it low on the carbs (which is hard to do in this city), and there were a ton of options for making your meal starchy carb-free."}
{"text":"I am going to be upfront with you, this place melts my heart, makes me feel warm inside, had me fall in love. Had to leave because it felt THAT good. I actually think about this cozy eatery, thought about it about all the way back to NY.    I suppose you want to hear about the food?  Fine, I will tell you first....I am Lebanese through and through AND from Beirut so when you come to my house half of Omnivore's menu is served by Mama herself.  It'll make your soul sing BUT this Montreal Middle Eastern joint will make you get up and preach, speak in tongues.  This is it folks, it's all the things food SHOULD be.  Authentic, rich & balanced on the palette, Kefta spooning with a pickle, snug tight with a fresh-made pita and the slightest bit of garlic aroma fills your nose and takes you to that hot Beiruti night on an apartment balcony.  Laffa in hand and a smile on your face.    If you come to Montreal and you don't stop by you are truly a fool."}
{"text":"Omnivore is about as perfect of a name as they can call this place, because I want to eat ALL THE THINGS. I fell in love with Lebanese food years ago, which is truly a tragedy, since true Lebanese food is very hard to find. I search far and wide, and I usually end up disappointed, with only the bitter (ha) taste of defeat left in my mouth.  Not so, Omnivore. I haven't been to Lebanon yet, but if the food is even half as good as it is here, I won't ever leave. The hummus is amazing (only thing, maybe homemade pita would be better) and very generously served for what is really a bargain price, and the kafta sandwiches were OMG THESE WERE THE BEST THINGS EVER. I'm seriously considering going back for lunch today and dinner, too.  It helps that it is a comfortable environment and felt clean but also homey. Not sure how they pulled that one off but it's okay with me. I think I might kidnap the whole restaurant and take it with me everywhere."}
{"text":"Another tasty cheap meal. Thank you Montreal for being so generous like that. $6 I think for a chicken pita, and free conversation with the friendly Lebanese man who works there. Or owns it. Nice people, good food, win."}
{"text":"Fait que ça faisait un p'tit moment que j'avais ajouté Omnivore dans ma liste de Favoris pour être sûre d'y aller et quand ma copine m'a proposer d'aller manger su'l plateau, c'était le bon moment!  Cette copine et moi aimons bien partager plein de plats pour goûter aux plus de choses possibles alors 2 assiettes quelques entrées et un Baklawa faisait un bon diner à partager.   Over all tout était bon, j'ai particulièrement aimé la viande kafta et le hummus maison. Mais mettons que je m'attendais à une petite coche au dessus en regardant son classement sur Yelp.   L'endroit est pas mal petit mais très bien situé. Le service était amical mais sans plus."}
{"text":"What a wonderful meal we just had here. Warning, cash or debit card only. It is situated in a fun district, with lots of funky shopping. Don't be fooled by the name, there is plenty of meat.I got the Thai beef sandwich, delicious charcoal grilled beef that ran The whole length of a fresh grilled Syrian bread roll with delicious ingredients such as cabbages and carrots inside. My daughter got a yummy vegetarian plate with an assortment of fresh crispy delicious vegetables. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First meal in Montreal. Perfect for the veggie wife, omnivore husband. He had a chicken platter with lentils rice and an awesome salad. I had a veggie Thai wrap thing that was grilled. Very very tasty."}
{"text":"Lovely little corner resto on Marie-Ann and St Laurent, bright, sunny with great local art and chalkboard menus. Sandwiches are delicious with grilled meats and vegetables fresh from a maple bbq grill and utterly inexpensive (6$). The name of the place made me think the menu would be full of ostriches and bison and bark, but in fact it's more like a very high quality pita stand with chicken, beef, tabbouleh, etc. Oh and I haven't tried them but apparently the fresh juices are amazing - beet and carrot! Heath kick hiYAH!"}
{"text":"Decent food.  Got the hummus, and the jedra with chicken  A little too Westernized for me but would defintley go back.   According to the cashier, the hummus had sumac on it but I think it was paprika?"}
{"text":"I've tried 4 of their salads and here are their ranks (for me): - Black Bean salad: yum level = addictive - Orzo salad: yum level = why can't all salads taste this good?!? - Fatouch salad: yum level = this actually makes me like Italian parsley - Moussaka salad: yum level = quite good but I might prefer it hot?  The must haves are the lentil rice, kafta and garlic sauce (amazing with pita)!"}
{"text":"I am seriously considering starting a petition to get these guys to open up in NYC.  HOW does someone make food taste so good in a such a simple way that one actually smiles upon chewing?    Finding this place was a miracle in itself.   We were lost on Boulevard Saint Laurent, cell-service-less in a foreign country and thus without the guide of Yelp.   We just bixi-biked (their version of Citibikes) through nearly the entire city, and we were hungry.  We wandered into this cozy joint with bizarre (probably local) artwork, tired and just wanting to be fed.    I usually stick to vegetarian meals when I eat any kind of Turkish, Middle Eastern, Lebanese, or Persian food.  In general, unless its simmering in a sauce or stew, I find the kebabs and koftas to be too dry.    The meat here is perfectly seasoned, juicy, flavors retained and released upon first bite.  It was hard to say whether the beef or the chicken was better, both were so good but different.    But I must sing the praises of this ridiculously delicious quinoa dish they served.  I LOVE quinoa, and I've had it in many forms.  This was by far the tastiest.  The quinoa is cooked and mixed with roasted sunflower seeds, peas, sesame oil, and soy sauce.  The sunflower seeds and sesame oil really give it a nutty toasted flavor, and the texture of the quinoa is broken up by the peas throughout each bite.  I could have had a bowl of this for dinner and been happy.    The other side dishes were all wonderfully cooked too - a lot of rich flavors in the roasted vegetable side dish, and even the salad was great.    The guy who mans the grill is cool, he quietly appreciates it when people enjoy his food.  I did try to have a serious talk with him about opening in NY, as we are saturated with Middle Eastern places but lack consistent quality in a casual, almost fast food setting that is also creative.  He smiled but sadly remained unconvinced.   So I had to have my fill.  On a 4 day trip we ate here twice.  The first by happenstance, the second out of sheer determination.    If you're a New Yorker visiting Montreal, please speak to him about coming to NY."}
{"text":"Omnivore is the kind of restaurants where you can go and eat there once per week. Located on St Laurent they serve Lebanese food and their menu consists mainly of sandwiches, salads and skewers. I am Lebanese and lived for the most part of my life in Lebanon and I can confidently say that Omnivore's cuisine is Lebanese authentic."}
{"text":"Great middle eastern + menu, with nice twists on classics. I find myself craving it often."}
{"text":"Superb food, friendly service, just awesome!  The Bombay sandwich is unlike any I've had. The combo of flavors exploded on my pallet. My husband ate his combo plate of salads as he raved over the deliciousness. Go to there. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place had been on my list for months. I finally got to try it! It's a cute little family owned middle eastern food joint. It's not your typical sit-down restaurant. You stand in the line to order your food. You can either take it to go or sit there if there's any space available. The food portions are quite generous. Absolutely loved their baba ghanouj! It comes with pita bread so no need to order it separately. For my main, I ordered the chicken plate. Everything was beyond delicious. Yummy middle eastern food - check!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, hot grilled dish, worth the price. It has two veggie options that are delicious"}
{"text":"Our lunch at Omnivore was yummy - we ordered platters with middle eastern and grilled vegetable/goat cheese wraps. The spices were complex and heavenly - really original flavors, and everything was so fresh. Their homemade lemonade was tart and perfect during a hot day of sightseeing. Cheerful service. Well priced. A gem!"}
{"text":"I found Omnivore through Yelp, and I'm so thankful for that!  It's become a pitstop staple for me.  Inexpensive, wholesome & delicious."}
{"text":"I love love love this restaurant, I always stock up on khodra kaftas, so good. Great friendly staff, right across from a park. The set up is tiny but very welcoming. Not crazy expensive, very clear, well written menus; up on the wall.Orders are taken from the counter.  Healthy sandwiches that are delicious! Nice ambiance.   Home made lemonade is really good."}
{"text":"Very good, and surprisingly affordable. They did forget part of our order, but handled it well and were very apologetic.  The yogurt (?) garlic sauce is great."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place in Montréal. Food is so good and people are very nice !"}
{"text":"Pleased to meat you, Omnivore! You'll never know how delicious this place is, lentil you taste it for yourself. The salad was really refreshing. It sure beets all the other simple salads I've had. My toddler also loved eating here. He said, \"the eggplant is yum! baba good nosh!\" I want to say something about the food being Kafta-esque but that doesn't make sense since they are literally Kaftas."}
{"text":"Whatever you do - get the \"thai\".  You have to do it.  You will see what I mean when you take this leap of faith.  It will change your life forever.  Happy eating and * I will see you there * - well at least before me and hubby goes back to Vancouver =D."}
{"text":"Both my bf and I are carnivores but we were so happy at Omnivore! Lovely establishment, as other reviewers said a step up from your normal kafta place! Cheap food, nice staff, can't beat that. And lots of proteins"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious!! We got the omnivore plate. We tried both types of beef and the grape leaves, eggplant dish.  The hummus is so fresh and light"}
{"text":"I have no idea why I didn't go to Omnivore sooner. It's the kind of place where you leave full, but not in the horrible \"why did I just eat all of that?\" kind of way. More like the \"I'm so freakin happy right now\" way.   Their platters are delectable, and as mentioned above, super filling. If you're looking for a nice balance, the Omnivore platter is right up your alley - lentil/rice, salad, pita, hummus, baba ganoush, and a meat skewer (or two?) is the perfect meal. Feeling meatier? Carnivore platter. Going light? There's a Herbivore platter too!  Oh, and if you'd rather bring you meal home, everything can be ordered to go."}
{"text":"Moi et mon copain sommes fans de Omnivore, nous y allons régulièrement. La nourriture est savoureuse et variée. Je prends souvent des plats pour apporter. Il ne faut pas être pressé, mais ça en vaut amplement la peine car les assiettes sont toujours d'une fraicheur irréprochable. Si vous n'avez jamais essayé cet endroit, je vous le conseil sans faute. Ceci dit, en ce qui me concerne,c'est addictif! :-)"}
{"text":"Good selection of middle eastern food in mile end.  Recommend getting the carnivore plate."}
{"text":"Ma dernière visite au Omnivore remontait à quelques années. La nourriture était aussi bonne que dans mes souvenirs! Les assiettes de viandes et salades sont très bien remplies; portion généreuse de salade, un peu moins de viande. Tu peux choisir entre poulet ou boeuf mais tu ne peux pas choisir les salades ou les sauces. Un peu dispendieux pour une place rapide: 13.99$ + taxes.  (Les sandwichs sont un bon compromis: 7$, 11$ en combo).  Les tables se remplissent vites et la file peut être plutôt longue parfois."}
{"text":"We got two sandwiches both vegetarian and both were delicious! Our favorite was the Thai but we also liked he Roma. The homemade lemonade is also great!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Picture a big tree house in the middle of an emerald green forest. Omnivore would look exactly like the interior of that cabin. Amazing and fresh Lebanese food. I was recommended vegetables that I usually hate but now I'd love to have those as salads everyday. Each element on my dish was so fresh and vibrant. The tabbouleh was the best I've ever had. Parsley was freshly green, the onions were crunchy, and the right amount of acidity came from the tomatoes and the lemon juice so it makes you want to chew the salad and suck all those juices out. The service was also fast and friendly. After finishing my meal I felt like I ate a super healthy and delicious meal which also made me feel good about myself. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Bonne cuisine méditerranéenne ! Si vous voulez, mangez de la bonne cuisine méditerranéenne santé et de qualité, vous avez trouvés. J'ai opté pour l'assiette omnivore à 11,25$ est celle-ci était délicieuse, venant avec de la salade, lentilles, hummus, boeuf ou poulet et des tranches de pitas. Je me suis régalé. Pas d'alcool, juste du thé/tisane/café. Déco assez vieillot, ''peace & love'', prix très abordable, service rapide de la serveuse, je vais y retourner pour essayer d'autres plats. À savoir, argent comptant & débit seulement, ils ne prennent pas les cartes de crédit. Pas de wifi.   4/5 Visité en mars 2015."}
{"text":"Wow this is great food... Had the omnivore plate with beef and chicken, hummus, baba, and more... Outstanding. Wife had the Beirut sandwich and loved it. Can't go wrong here... Every single thing I had was excellent. Limited seating though.... Nice staff."}
{"text":"The lentil rice and chicken were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The chocolate cups were a nice treat. The staff was friendly. Glad we found this place on our trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here this week with 3 people.  I ordered the mixed med plate, generous portion, that came with an unbelievable fatush salad (puts Damas to shame)incredible humus, delicious grilled chicken on top of kinoa and a light mayonnaise dip with fresh thin pita.  The service was fast and amazing and the atmosphere was fresh and slightly bohemian.  I highly recommend them.  Great experience."}
{"text":"You can not go wrong with this place. It's cute its healthy. The food is just a total joy and the price range for what you get is amazing. The chicken wrap and the kofte wrap do it for me everytime...we always get the 3 different salad plate as well. Their green beans are srsly as good as grandma style. Beautifully crafted."}
{"text":"It'a a delicious alternative to the fast food Lebanese we are used to (which is still very good).  However, the portion size is small. We have big appetites and one sandwich does nothing for us. You need to order at least 3 sandwiches for 2 people unless you take a few side salads. I would prefer paying more and having a bigger portion.  Another downside... They don't offer garlic potatoes, which I really enjoy with my Lebanese food.  Nevertheless, the ingredients are of excellent quality and everything is delicious. Be prepared to wait at least 10-15 minutes for your sandwiches as everything is cooked to order in the charcoal.    Service is very friendly.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"$7 for a wrap isn't terribly expensive but I expected them to be a bit bigger. They are long but thin and might not fill you up if you're really hungry. As a combo with a fresh juice it's $10 but be aware that it's very carrot-heavy and possibly not to everyone's taste. The meat in every sandwich can be replaced with a vegetarian alternative. The SAMAC sandwich with the veggy option was very tasty. The only originally vegan sandwich, the KHODRA, is not well balanced in flavour. It's quite bland and unexciting. I liked the vibe and decoration of the place so I might give Omnivore another try. Maybe the $11 combo of sandwich + salad + drink will make it a more satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Good food takes time.  I am the biggest whiner when it comes to waiting for my meal. I get hangry in moments, and I have struggled for years with my relationship to Omnivore for this very reason.  Am I a masochist? Why do I keep coming back? Am I simply addicted to their delicious wraps? The answers: kind of - it's conveniently located and healthy - and yes, I have an addiction.  Today I am dining in, which is unusual and spontaneous of me, and I also ordered a trio because I just got my butt kicked at Yoga Vieux Montreal (see my review there!). The good news is that 2/3 of my trio (a hot infusion and a fattouche) were served within minutes. The great news is: this salad is da bomb. Why have I wasted so many years getting my meals to go when dining in is such a delightful experience?   Look, everyone will tell you the food is great here but it takes forever. Well, if you want your meat cooked that morning (or - gross - the day before) go to some cheap, greasy, late night diner. If you want yummy (and I think you do, because you came to Yelp for advice), come here.   My sandwich arrived in the time it took me to write this review. See? Not that long. And mmmmmmm... Totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Love the home made lemonade!  On long afternoons (or mornings) after golf my friends and I always debate on where we should grab a bite. Normally we choose a place on St-Laurent as it is pretty central from where we are coming from. Today we went to Omnivore, a place that my friends have been raving about for quite sometime...but clearly I've never been to.   I really enjoyed the food, we had lemonade(home made of course) to start while we waiting for our food to be ready. I really like it, I think there was a little bit of rose water in it...but I am not to sure! We both ate the Omnivore plate with a beef kafta. It came with a salad, rice & beans, pita chips, baba ganoush, and hummus. The baba ganoush was delicious, you really tasted the roasted eggplant.  This will be a plate I will have to try again."}
{"text":"First-timer recommendations: Arez for vegetarians and Roma for not. Fast and delicious always."}
{"text":"good little place to fill you up without too much guilt, its exotic and fresh but not so much authentic i guess its a fusion place that always gets compared to how a real kabab should taste like for the originality i give it a 3/5"}
{"text":"Dès que vous y entrez, vous pouvez sentir l'odeur des copeaux de bois qui fument les viandes et les kaftas. Ça sent bon! Le menu est assez simple mais oh combien créatif et différent et la plupart des autres endroits pour se trouver un bon sandwich pas loin de là. L'inspiration méditerranéenne est évidente sans tomber dans le typique du kebab avec taboulé et humus. Vu le processus et le souci des ingrédients frais et locaux, c'est un peu lent pour recevoir votre plat, mais ça en vaut vraiment la peine. Les ingrédients viennent du Québec et sont remplis de bonnes choses (pas de préservatifs ou de cochonneries du genre.) C'est aussi un petit paradis pour les végétariens car une grande portion de leurs options ne comprennent ni viande, ni poisson, ni oeufs, ni produits laitiers. Un arrêt que je risque de faire assez souvent cet été quand j'ai besoin de me rendre jusqu'au nord de la ville en Bixi!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service. We had the omnivore plate, a Bombay sandwich, and a piece of baklava that was AMAZING.  It's a very cute/eclectic little restaurant and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Such a lovely place! Great food, good quantity & friendly ppl, I couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: From the outside, Omnivore seemed a little bit dark but as soon as you walk in, you realize how homey it feels. It's a small restaurant but has a very nice aesthetic to it. And seeing how it is on the corner of St-Laurent, it offers a pretty nice view.  FOOD: I got the Thai wrap and it was delicious. Although it is a bit small, the quality of the wrap was definitely on the higher end. It was a light meal. The meat was tender and very flavour-packed.  PRICE: It was quite affordable, especially for the quality that you're getting. However, like I said, the plates are a bit small so don't expect to get a huge portion.  SERVICE: Omnivore was more of a \"food court\" type restaurant where you order at the counter and they bring you your food once it's ready so there wasn't too much service to be offered. But the overall the workers seemed quite friendly."}
{"text":"I don't give out 4 stars easily. Especially with only 1 visit, but my sons loved it so much we had to order them another Carnivore platter that they devoured. The service was great and efficient. Most of the tables are set up for 4 people and one large table that could sit 8-10 pp, but I would't go there with that big of a party. They also package the food well for take out and turn over is pretty good. With Fall approaching great food to take on a picnic or outdoor performance. My only complaint or wish is they add a Shawarma lamb platter to the menu, so if you travel to Montreal this is a must stop destination."}
{"text":"Wonderful!!! The food tastes as good as it looks!!! It tastes fresh and bright. Full of flavor without feeling like it is too heavy after eating it.  Both the vegetarian plate and meat plates were delicious and I don't usually like the ground up meats.  The sandwiches were small but packed with flavor and the mint lemonade was delicious!!!!!! A great find!!! Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"4.5  Happiness. Pure happiness. On my plate and in my mouth. From the outside, Omnivore's not much to look at... but this is a good thing. It means that rather than concentrating its efforts to look hip and cool, tptb behind Omnivore concentrate on good food, nice service and an authentic experience. This is not to say, however, that Omnivore looks shabby. It doesn't. It's comfy, welcoming and fits the neighborhood nicely. I was particularly enamored with the mosaic tables.  In the proper frame of mind, I looked over the menu and made my selection. A chilly day in a chill restaurant demands tea. Fresh tea. Fresh mint tea... as in, mint leaves, simple syrup, water, and a cup. Boisson (much like poisson, one of my favorite French words) out of the way, I was ready to order the rest of my combo. Yes, combo. For $10, you get a kafta sandwich, soup and drink. For my soup, the green garlic-type soup was filling, deeply-flavored and wonderfully-made. Eating it was like eating warm joy. The garlic wasn't overpowering but it was, certainly, the star of the show. I decided on the Bombay kafta: chicken, sumac onions, cabbage, and pineapple chutney. Tell me that doesn't sound incredible. You can't. You can't tell me that. Because it *was* incredible. The sandwich was generously-portioned, spicy and textured so that every bite had a nice crunch as well as plenty of meat & seasoning. Although I was tasked with working after lunch, I much rather have found a nice corner in which to curl up with a book and take a nap. Omnivore serves comfort food from a Mid-East perspective that's sure to delight. It made me fall even more in love with Montreal."}
{"text":"So much delicious food for a pretty decent price! We ordered the omnivore plate with chicken and the carnivore plate with beef and chicken. It comes with hummus, plenty of pita, really fresh salad, and my personal favorite- creamy garlic sauce! My only complaint is I wish the omnivore plate came with a little more chicken. Otherwise, a really great place!"}
{"text":"I had heard so many rave reviews about Omnivore over the past few years and it certainly did not disappoint. I went two times in as many days because the food was just so tasty and affordable. The restaurant is tiny but with a lovely earthy ambiance, and again - the food!!!!!   On my first visit, I split a 5x mezze with my friend. The falafel was a bit dry but the hummus made up for it. All the other salads and dips we chose came recommended by the server, and we didn't regret a single one.   The second time, I ordered the Samac  sandwich + fattoush + lemonade combo. There was a bit too much dressing on the fattoush and I found it lacking in variety of vegetables but it was good nonetheless. The lemonade was freshly squeezed, herb-infused, and so so so refreshing. The Samac was to die for - piping hot and possibly one of the most delicious things I've had in my life.  All in all, a great cheap place and the price doesn't compromise taste. I'm sad I didn't listen to my friends' recommendations earlier and missed out on two years of this amazing food."}
{"text":"The food was really good! I wasn't sure what to expect when I went but I ordered a beef kafta and it was super delicious. The place is pretty small inside and got really hot so I would suggest ordering your food and maybe sitting at the park across the street to eat."}
{"text":"Mmmm... This lunch was beyond fulfilling and flavorful!! I'm one happy girl! Ha!   Had the cubed chicken with rice, salad and hummus. Everything was fresh and delicious! Honestly I would have a second plate if I had more room to fill! My BF had the three meats and the same sides. We're both full and satisfied!   Definitely worth every penny!   The staff was nice. The place is a bit small."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, perfectly cooked. Friendly envornment. Love the place!! Would definitely come back on my next visit to Montreal. Omnivore doshes were very tasty, and the kebba was perfectly made. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my list for quite some time. It's a hole in the wall with very few seats and fast food style.   We ordered a omnivore (5 mezzes) and carnivore dish ( 3 beef brochettes).  We had the tabbouleh, falafel, orzo salad, kibbeh and the string bean salad. Everything was super yummy except for this string bean salad that had ginger. It simply does not blend well with middle eastern food since it wasn't such a subtle taste. I would recommend to stay away from the string bean salad if you don't like ginger.  It's easily 40$ for two people for fast food and the seats aren't that comfortable....   I would go back again to satisfy my Lebanese craving if I am in that area."}
{"text":"What a delicious dinner. After a few days of heavy meals, I wanted to enjoy some fresh and satisfying fare, and Omnivore was perfect. Great area (if you're a tourist, it's a great street to check out--lots of designers and local spots), and the staff were so friendly and helpful. I got the herbivore x3 with chickpea salad, a tomato-based eggplant dish, and hummus (came with pita). The pita was a bit cool, thin and chewy, but it was a most excellent vehicle for all that deliciousness. My hubs got the hot chicken curry sandwich--he (an avid Indian food eater) said it was good. Definitely a Mediterranean fusion style of Indian food--very tangy, as in citrus-y. It's not a strong curry, and he ate it all. I loved my own so much that I marched right back up to the counter and ordered the Beirut hot sandwich to be my brunch on our train ride the next day. I've just finished it, and I give it a delightfully satisfied 2 thumbs up, and I don't care one bit what my train-mates think of the smell of beef and onions emanating from my onboard meal. I imagine it would have been even more delicious warm! If I lived in Montreal, I'd be a regular here, for sure."}
