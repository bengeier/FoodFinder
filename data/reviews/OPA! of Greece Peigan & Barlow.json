{"text":"Greek food fast. This location is close to where we live so convenience earns points for it. The food is okay, nothing to write home about but it fills the stomach more pleasantly than traditional fast food. I also think most of their items are good value for your money. I'd give them 4 stars but they always seem to take a little longer than you'd expect to prepare the food. Their Greek potatoes are also a little weird and half cooked. But with a souvlaki meal having rice, bread and salad too, I can look past one weird, sad looking potato."}
{"text":"For the past 6 years, I have worked nearby and bought lunch twice a week.  The vast majority of the time, it's been Opa.  Being a creature of habit, I always order what used to be combo #5; a gyro wrap and fries.  There was a change in ownership about a year ago, and things have been slipping ever since.  I've observed customer service deteriorate.  I haven't seen the gyro meat mounted to the spit in 6 months, and that causes it to taste very different.  The Greek word gyro literally translates to \"spin\", so the fact that the gyro meat is being cooked on the grill top as opposed to the spit counters the preparation fundamentals of this food.  I inquired with one of the owners about it, and they stated that the meat was spit mounted every second day.  I took that to heart and tried to change the days that I went, but the gyro still wasn't ever mounted on the spit.  There has also been a very noticeable decease in the amount of tzatziki sauce, to the point where it is now a very dry wrap.  Today, they didn't put the standard dollop of tzatziki on the end of my wrap.  I asked why not, and the staff member said that they were told not to do it anymore.  I understand cutting costs, but when the quality of your food is being sacrificed in order to pad your bottom line, you'll end up losing customers.  I won't be returning to this Opa.  Instead, I'll be going to the Subway next door."}
{"text":"Nothing really to talk about.  It's a Jimmy the Greek equiv.  You know, burnt meat on a stick with garlic sauce and some form of starch.  For the health conscious people, add greek salad.  It's food court food that was close to my Calgary office.  Next time, hopefully I'll have more time and visit the small steakhouse nearby.  Not a repeat place but it's good to have when burgers and fries just won't cut it...OPA! Cheers!"}
