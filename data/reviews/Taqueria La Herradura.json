{"text":"Really good food and friendly service. Little to no wait time. The place looks a little sketchy outside but it's nice once you walk in"}
{"text":"I just found a new family favorite! I've received a  thumbs up from everybody... We will be returning, many times I'm sure so great job!
 Everything was delicious from tacos to torta. I had the milanesa gotta which was cooked just right, I tasted a hint of mutstard.. Very nice touch. Between my kids and husband, they had tacos al pastor, carne asada and pescado.. All great along with the rolled tacos."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food at insanely low prices. The $4.99 special is out of this world. My entire meal was absolutely delicious. Best prices in town for high quality tacos. $1.29 tacos, am I in Mexico? lol"}
{"text":"I order the chorizo and eggs. It was out of this world. Felt like I was back in Baja. Excited to return and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"New breakfast burrito joint in my hood! This is place opened not too long ago and I think the quality of their burritos blows every other place out of the water. Never overly salty like Roberto's. But perfectly balanced and flavorful!

I've been stuck on their California burrito which has fries plus I add guacamole.  Make your way downtown to try their food. Seriously! I haven't got around to trying their tacos but by god, their burritos are bomb-diggity!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Large portions!! Reasonable prices!! Nice little restaurant away from all the action. It was the perfect place for my family."}
{"text":"Came on a nice Sunday afternoon to enjoy some tacos and I was definitely not disappointed. I ordered three Al Pastor tacos and they were cooked to perfection. With a few bites in, one can easily tell that the restaurant use the freshest ingredients and the highest quality of meat. I strongly recommend putting both the red and green sauces on the tacos for a great combination of spiciness and flavor. I also ordered a very refreshing agua de pi√±a, which accompanied the tacos very well due to the spiciness of the red sauce. I truly can't wait to come back and try more items in the menu."}
{"text":"The food is delicious here. I absolutely love the sopes! The staff is super friendly and accommodating. This is definitely one of my favorite Mexican restaurants..."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly and helpful staff...clean too! You will be hard pressed to find a better taco for a buck twenty-nine. Several varieties to choose from at this price. A delightful birria dish is available on weekends. They also serve up a delicious champurrado...which is an earthy, rustic, warm beverage made with masa, chocolate, spices and piloncillo...a type of sugar minimally processed ~just cane juice boiled down to a thick syrup, and typically formed into cone shapes. It's a real treat!  Extra added bonus, the tortillas are house made on the spot too. All the expected condiments are on display, the pickled carrots/onions are a stand out with a nice accent of Mexican oregano. Taqueria La Herradura is another shining star along the Charleston Ave taco trail."}
