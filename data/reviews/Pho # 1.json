{"text":"Pho-bulous!!! I was delighted to find a place with great tasting Pho! I've tried a number of things on the menu and enjoyed them all. This is real Vietnamese food, at its finest. On top of that, the service is excellent."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and delicious. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So good I'm half Vietnamese and it exceeded my expectations. It taste authentic and has lots of flavor"}
{"text":"I'll be back, pho sure.  For first timers I recommend the #7 pho bowl- the portions are quite large and the quality of the meats they use are top notch.  Being a professional chef by trade, I've had my fair share of Pho -I knew immediately after my first bite that Pho #1 is the real deal.   The prices are very affordable and a great value.  The restaurant has easy parking and my entree was served to me within 5-7 minutes after I ordered."}
{"text":"Place is fairly clean and well maintained. The staff are polite, very nice and over all great. The food is awesome, the half quail appetizer is the best appetizer there, but the PHO is by far the best PHO I've had here around Kannapolis and concord area."}
{"text":"I am torn on this one (maybe 3.5 stars), its a new business so we have to give them the benefit of the doubt here. Pho was good, well seasoned broth, portion was good but prices are about $2 more for the same size at other places.  Same for other dishes across the board, $3.95 for a Vietnamese Iced coffee? 

We arrived around 11:45 and the only customers in restaurant but still had to ask for water refills.  Later as more people arrived we knew it was time for the check as our plates had been removed for some time now but still no check.  My biggest pet peeve at a restaurant is waiting for a check, your done, ready to leave, but your help hostage waiting for a check. Finally we pay and depart again with mixed feelings about Pho #1, but given that the closest Pho is available several miles south at Yama on Concord Mills Blvd. we will still return here.

Again, a new business obviously run by a family so service may be suspect but they were super nice and made good food!

{"text":"Pho #7 is a must try! I came with my whole family and we all really loved it. The food was delicious and you could tell it was fresh. The environment was very welcoming and the staff was even friendlier."}
{"text":"The spring rolls (rice wrapper) is my favorite with the peanut sauce. I had the beef pho it was ok, nothing to go crazy about."}
{"text":"I am so glad we have a good Pho restaurant in the area. They are currently in search of wait staff because of this, you do have to be a bit patient but the food is worth it. At first glance the menu seems small but that's because they allow for you to make many different selections under the same order number. The people are very nice and as for quality, there is only one I know that is better (Lang Van- in Charlotte). They are a very good restaurant, especially when it comes to traditional Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place tonight and was not disappointed!  I tried the Vietnamese yellow crepes with chicken and shrimp and my husband had the pork and chicken noodle bowl (the #17). It was delicious!  Their homemade fish sauce is amazing!  And the spring rolls were piping hot and fresh.  Great server - didn't catch his name but I'm thinking he might be the owner?!  Will be back to try something new."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Pho was amazing!! Service was helpful and great!!! Must go if your in Concord"}
{"text":"I have tried this restaurant 3 times in total... No amount of craving Vietnamese food will compel me to try a 4th time! First off all 3 times ive eaten here i got the Hu Tieu dac biet (my go to,  not a first try situation) all 3 times it was different than the description and different from the other times.  The first time the guy that works there gave me a few bucks off my food as several meats were missing.  The second time the girl that works here told me the limes,  Thai basil,  and bean sprouts are only served with Pho and not with Hu Tieu.  The third and final time my soup was missing  chicken,  crab,  and fish balls. It was also served w cilantro instead of Thai basil.  I asked the guy about the items and he said they do not come in my dish.  After pulling up the menu pics on yelp and asking why he was lying about what they have listed he got upset and wouldnt even let me get a full sentence out before cutting me off to ask what i want him to do about it.  He went into some explanation about the menu being incorrect.  Not once did he apologize or admit that he specifically told me that the meats are not in that soup and that they arent listed as being in the soup.  The customer service here is terrible,  even without the incorrect menu the broth is not very flavorful and they have the gall to skimp on meat even though they only give you half of the meats you expect. I'll  go to Pho Real,  Lang Van, or Pho Hoa next time."}
{"text":"The pho was ok. The broth is good. There was no one there when we went. Their egg rolls is kind of dried. The iced coffee is on point though. There was a fly flying around while we were eating. Just bugs me and I couldn't give them another star due to the fly flying around us and on our food."}
{"text":"If in Concord /Kannapolis this is a great pho option. Fresh ingredients, everything made to order.. there is nothing cookie cutter about this place ! Very satisfying broth! Eat-In if you get the chance great service. Take out is also legit ask for more veggies if you like them though.."}
{"text":"Decided to take the family here about 2 weeks ago to try it out.  If I'm not mistaken, it is the same location that used to be a Thai Restaurant. Inside decor has changed but the service (even though it's a different owner) is about the same.  Took a bit to take our drink orders and well as our main course orders even though the other tables already received their food.  Appetizers took almost 10 minutes to arrive. They did not look anything near what they are in the menus. Waiter/owner walked by our table a few times and didn't even bother to refill water in our glasses until he noticed other tables needed it as well. 

A few minutes later, our orders arrived to our table.  The Pho was okay, nothing to brag about.  This place is definitely understaffed and food is mediocre, at best.  Sorry, will continue to go to my usual spots instead. NOT IMPRESSED."}
{"text":"The pho is amazing, but the peanut sauce for the spring rolls needs more peanut butter. Also it would be nice if they added a little bit more sliced beef for the large portion. However we will be back."}
{"text":"Best pho in the area. We needed a good pho place in Concord. You go here for the food not the decor."}
{"text":"Our family loves Pho#1. They have the best Pho in the Charlotte area. It's worth the drive. The owners are really nice and great about explaining everything on the menu. You can just tell that they cook the broth for a long time. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! Pho has a very flavorful soup compared to the other pho places that load up their soup with MSG. The combination rice with soup was A1. If you're feeling hungry for pho this is the place to stop at. All the food reminds me of my moms home cooking."}
{"text":"Pictures don't do justice! By that I mean the pictures they have of their food on here and on their menus aren't of their food! Ordered nem nuong rolls and they were dinky af! Looked like fun size snicker bars size! The pho was good however. Deep broth, with decent meat cuts. An average bowl in any town. The com dac Biet didn't even have broken rice when it was on the menu! The components just didn't seem to work together! Egg cake was different but in a not better way, pork tasted like it's been seasoned for a while and left in cooler for too long, etc etc. I don't know, maybe for a pho kick next time only."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We came kind late on a Sunday evening, and they was ready to represent GOOD quality food, spring roils were very fresh, quails was delicious and PHO was flavorful."}
{"text":"This place \"wow\"ed my whole family. I grew up in California eating home made pho made by a Vietnamese granny.  I can be a snob with this, but I can really say #1 pho of NC.  We drove couple hours for staycation and found this jewel. 

Taste: 
Broth is amazing.  Deep and light at the same time.  No MSG per owner and I can tell as well because my mouth wasn't numb.  Great meat/portion/ noodle (not too soggy or firm- just right)  my husband wanted to go back there and mass buy and freeze it- it's was that good. 

Price: 
It's alright.  Higher than what I'm used to but normal for Nc. 

Service: 

Great service.  Owner checked on us.  Made sure we were pleased and very catering.  Kind and personable staffs. 

I wish I lives closer so I can come here everyday.  If you are a pho enthusiast, come here. You won't regret it."}
