{"text":"CREPES! CREPES! CREPES!  Savory and sweet CREPES!   And some of the best damn coffee ever.   Plus you can't beat the sweet little french atmosphere. I totally felt like I was in Paris while I was here. From the music in the background, to the lacy curtains in the window, and the crepe pan practically table-side.   Total cuteness!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice since the owners changed, and this placed went from being Le Oui Oui cafe to Le Petit Triangle.  Good: Cute little restaurant, very intimate feel.  The ratatouille was fabulous, and the crepes were tasty, especially the nutella and strawberry one I shared with my friend.  French press coffee was fine.  Bad:  Had a cafe au lait one time before and it was kind of meh.  The place is tiny, so if you get there at a busy time, prepare to wait."}
{"text":"Mmm. Came here for dessert/wine/coffee with a group of people and it was amazing. Chevre and Strawberry crepes. That's what I ordered. And this is what I sounded like while eating it::: Mmmmm. Oh. So. Good.   Definitely recommend making a visit. The space is small, so be sure to make a reservation.  Also - name has changed to Le Petit Triangle."}
{"text":"Cozy, romantic.... might need a reservation. Excellent french cuisine and wonderful neighborhood (near Johnny Mangos)"}
