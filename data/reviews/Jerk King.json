{"text":"Jerk King is one of my favourite take-out joints in the city. I know it's not super fancy and the furniture is a bit haphazardly selected, but there's something very earnest and loving about it. Highly recommendable are the oxtail stew, the jerk chicken and the fried chicken. You will not get better fried chicken in the city for this price (unless/even if you make it home). It is juicy, tender, well-seasoned and always freshly made. One bite and you will know that this is something the chef takes great pride in :)"}
{"text":"Gotta love this spot, really.   Can't go wrong if you grab a patty and a large rice with oxtail gravy. Realistically, if you're this close to Roti Palace and not eating there, it's probably 3am. No hate, jus sayin'.    ***PRO-TIP***  If you're on a budget, grab a large rice and peas with extra oxtail gravy. And don't forget to exchange pleasantries with the fine servers/staff/ppl.    let's go"}
{"text":"I can only speak to amazingness of the veggie and chicken rotis.  The potatoes, chicken and chickpeas are cooked down in perfectly flavoured curry sauces. The roti is huge and I usually save half for the next day.  If you like it spicy ask for the hot sauce. Go for the coleslaw as a side, it's perfectly creamy.  The service is friendly, and efficient.  Would I go back? Yes. I've had to wean myself off of going every week."}
{"text":"i've been stumbling in here post-revelry for the last month or so. very highly recommended."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I'm always disappointed. There are not a lot  Caribbean cuisine places around this area.  At the end of the day thus IS NOT  Caribbean food. The jerk chicken is terrible, and the food just doesn't seem fresh. I would rather drive out of my way to get real  Caribbean food, than to eat here. The prices and portions do not match either."}
{"text":"Never order delivery; if they don't have what you ordered they will give you whatever they have, ie, substitute jerk for curry chicken, yet still use the same gravy. They often do not have all menu items available, and even after waiting 20-30 minutes, the final product is undercooked, or just subpar. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"As far as casual dining or take out goes, I love this place and think it provides great value.  I didn't even know I loved jerk chicken until I discovered Jerk King.     A large jerk chicken order is good for two people and is only $10 after tax.  I also recommend the boneless chicken roti and ox tail!  And if you're up for trying some Jamaican sweets, the cassava cake is delicious.    Service is quick and friendly.  There are always people coming into the restaurant to grab things to go that often the food trays turn over quickly, so the food is fresh!"}
{"text":"I was a steady regular here right from when they opened, but have stopped coming mainly due to terrible slow service. It just took 20 minutes to get a curry chicken with only one customer ahead of me. I wouldn't mention it except that is typical of my last dozen visits. In fact, I have ifyen jusy given up and left many times, and have witnessed many other customers do the same. It is like they just don't care.  It is not like they are extremely busy at the times I go. The people behind the counter just ignore the customers, move comically slowly, and are often surly. The last few customers who came on were all very nice and made simple orders, but the counter person turned each order into a weird argument, misunderstanding their order and denying it. Maybe this part is a language problem?  It is a real shame, because this place used to be great, and the service was friendly and fantastic.  The one thing I can't take away from them is that the jerk chicken is still amazing. That is what keeps me coming back every once in a while hoping things have changed. I really want this place to fix the service problem. It would be a gold mine if it weren't for that.  If anyone there reads this, I would suggest that you put your hot sauce out on the tables. It is very good and really compliments some of the dishes."}
{"text":"Cheap food, open till 3am but terrible interior, service really sucks. Staffs sometimes over charge you and they will mix up your order.   Tips: try the jerk wrap. best for take outs not dine ins."}
{"text":"I like the food at this place as I have been going for years now.  But I have to say the service really sucks. Big time attitude from the rude staff at this place. When I was in there last year a whole bunch of us waited to be served and because the service was so slow they lost customers and a lot of people just walked right out the door.  I really like there ox- tail.  But I have noticed recently that a lot of bones were included in my food.  I don't want to be paying for bones. I recently went in there and the staff was so rude and disgusting.   Beware of this place because I was over charged for my items. I called the women on the phone to find out what the price was for what I ordered. I explained that she over charged me.  I told her exactly what I ordered and explained to her that the amount didn't add up. She pretended to play stupid with me and then somehow she remembered that I paid by debit.   In no way did I ever mention in my conversation how I paid.  So she knew exactly that she ripped me off and pretended to play dumb. So I went in person and boy was that even worse.   I explained that she was the one who service me yesterday which was February 09, 2016. She looked at me as if I was lying and asked me for the bank statement. What the hell would I need a bank statement when I was showing her the debit receipt!!!   I explained what I ordered and she pretended that she could not remember me.  She looked at me as if I had two heads. Very rude women. Then I said to her if you want I can go back home and get the box with all the bones from the ox-tail that I ordered.  She was so rude and said bones and started laughing.  Obviously if any one has every eaten ox-tail they would know that all that is left is the bones.  Very stupid and ignorant women.  The staff there is not only incompetent but extremely rude.  All of the staff there.   I had to argue with her just to get some of my money back.  They just lost a customer but I am sure they don't care because there customer service skills really suck and so do the people who work at this location. I would have given this place a Five star and more but because of I was ripped off and the service that is all they get.  If I could I would give them a 0.   I wonder how many people they rip off on a daily basis???  Just beware of your order when paying."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Their lunch special is very generous and only around $5-6! I have never ordered anything from there that I didn't like and it has become my coworkers and I's favourite lunch place. Lunch special between 11-1pm, it is perfect."}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly. It is my first time try this, she helped me a lot with ordering.  Ordered medium jerk chicken with medium spicy gravy. It is not as amazing as the other people said, but really worth the price. The portion is big too. A good place to go if in a low budget."}
{"text":"Ordered from here through the app skip the dishes. They got my order wrong and I called the phone number and right after the lady on the phone found out they got the order wrong she quickly said I called the wrong location. Google and yelp both say I called the right location with the correct phone number.  I called back and she never answered my calls for the rest of the night.  Shady business owner can not own upto their mistakes."}
{"text":"After looking around for some cheap eats, I settled on Jerk King because of its simple meals and considering that I was looking for take out dinner at 9:30pm. When I walked in, the place was empty and the workers were chilling, just there to serve and cook food, no big deal. I ordered a medium jerk chicken with rice and beans.  I was lucky in that both the rice and jerk chicken were fresh compared to the other food waiting patiently to be eaten for I'm not sure how long. The medium take out polysterene included 3 chicken drumsticks and about 2.5 large scoops of rice, all for $9 incl. tax. I may have read the menu wrong expecting the total to be $7.63 (could be a lunch price) but I guess $9 is alright-ish. I didnt wait long for the food to arrive, and the lady who served me was kind enough. They offer you spicy or mild gravy on the rice, along with coleslaw that I opted out of because I could. Sadly, I can't taste the food since I'm taking it out for someone else, but as for first impressions, it's a simple eat and go place. The place is not tiny, it could sit at least 20. I shall update on its taste when I get feedback.  UPDATE: \"It was alright I guess.\" - Doesn't mean much, but it doesn't mean it was terrible."}
{"text":"Came here for this first time and was pleasantly surprised. Curry goat and patty was excellent. Basic decor inside but generous servings and authentic food. Definitely coming back for another feast soon!"}
{"text":"Went there on a sunday morning with a god awful hangover.  Most places were closed.  Nothing was fresh and staff was surly and unpleasent but I didn't really care.  All of the food was sitting in a cafeteria style steam trays.  A dry crust covered all roti filling.  Got a chicken roti to go.  Was happily surprised to find that it was packed full and also boneless.  Not the best roti in town but it will definetly do in a pinch."}
{"text":"PROS: - I've had my share of jerk chicken in town, including from Rasta Pasta and Taste Seduction, and nothing comes close to the bangin' poultry at Jerk King. I've feasted on this delicacy at 2 am and 2pm, and it is consistently tender and beautifully marinated. Definitely request the hot gravy for your rice and beans, if you can handle the heat.   - The chicken roti is monstrous and great bang for your buck.  CONS: - I would prefer if eat-in orders were served on real plates to cut down on waste; I understand that such change would amount to more work for staff, but the styrofoam waste generated by this restaurant is anything but negligible.   - I always pull a hard pass on the side of coleslaw, as it is, in my opinion, uninspired and watery."}
{"text":"The best Jamaican food in town, hands (and feet) down. Portions are large, the meat is juicy. The friend plantans are dry (which is better for health) and naturally, healthly sweet. Try the Jerk Chicken or the Curry Goat (Large for $8.83). You'll be amazed."}
{"text":"Skin was good but the meat -- though it was dark meat which normally has more flavour -- wasn't that flavourful??  kind of odd.   it has mild spice so for those who hadn't tried jerk chicken before and want to ease into it may try this place out.   We ordered a combo that came with salad, jerk chicken, selection of 2 sides. we chose rice and potatoes. Inside it's all business just a counter with a smorgasbord of food behind a glass and some tables for patrons to sit. They were rockin the Bob Marley tracks in the background to add to the theme. :)  Excellent deal for $10 -- we split a large order between the two of us. It was enough. Decent tastying food.. not bad but not amazing either."}
{"text":"Really great food but, as with other reviewers, the staff are the only thing that stop me from giving a 5 star rating.  Jerk Chicken is my go to meal here and as someone who can eat a lot of food, the medium portion is huge! Never even bothered getting the large as the medium usually leaves me unable to move, let alone breathe (really spicy!)  Staff are slow and really seem to not be bothered at all. They also don't look very happy to see me when I come in! Quite an unwelcoming atmosphere but it doesn't bother me too much :)  Coleslaw is also great!"}
{"text":"Cheap, cheap and super tasty.  Their lunch special is a steal, I live nearby and often go in. You get a lot of tasty food for the price."}
{"text":"Incredible food, slower service.   They definatley could use a second person on the counter at times. I know there is a second person in the back, as they come to replenish the hot table, but never give a hand, even when there is a line up. 3.5 stars.  On to the food. The chicken roti is massive. Messy as anything but massive. It's a full meal, and they give a sweet little slaw with it that is rather delicious. Great price too.   Patty for snacks, always fresh never received a dried out one. I guess the volume they go through keeps them coming hot and fresh.  Jerk chicken dinner. A plentiful portion, lots o gravy and a fair portion of rice. Just watch out for the bones. Very delicious.  An all round great experience, but not something to grab if you are in a rush and there is a line up."}
{"text":"Pretty decent jerk chicken, although I've had better in Toronto. But great bang for the buck nonetheless!"}
{"text":"It's a good place to get jerk chicken. They have good slaw because it's creamy enough for me. Their curry potatoes are nice. And I usually get the jerk chicken with extra sauce. The jerk chicken is nice and tender. The amount of the rice you get really depend on the server, sometimes it's a good amount and sometimes it's too little for the amount of chicken you get. I'm a rice person so sometimes I do mind. So when that happens I usually just ask for extra rice and pay a bit extra. Good place for a quick bite but nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Let me just say one thing first: you must try the jerk chicken. It is nothing short of phenomenal. The meat falls off the bone, it is well marinated and the jerk sauce is AMAZING.   I also had a pastie which was really good too. Then in a fit of pure gluttony I also ordered some curry chicken which was excellent as well. I felt like the jerk chicken really stole the show though.   The service is counter style and all the food is  sitting on display in a case so you can point at whatever you want (and I did). When I was waiting to order there was a oven being pulled out through the threadbare dining room, if you even want to call it that. But I didn't come for the atmosphere. This place is all about the food. I wouldn't take a first date here, but I might consider ordering takeout and trying to pass it off as my own cooking.   I also want to stress the value here. You get A LOT of great food for not too many pesos. Huge servings and I will certainly be enjoying some great leftovers."}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber Eats the other day and everything was great--food, portion size, and service.  I ordered a jerk chicken plate, a fried dumpling, and plantain. They were out of plantain so they called me to ask if they could substitute something else, so I got a beef patty.   Everything was delicious and the portion sizes were good. My small jerk chicken plate, dumpling, and patty ended up feeding both my mom and I for $16 including tax and delivery fee (And we do not have small appetites).  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"walked into this place a couple days ago...its mostly a takeout place, but does have enough seating to dine in. a good variety of options on the menu like stewed beef, oxtail, chicken curry, curried goat, roti wraps. the service was super friendly and she explained what everything was (since i haven't done carib. food much i stand there and point, '..and what's that? and that?' hehe) which helped. overall the food was loaded with flavor, the meat was good and helpings were a good size (and if u ask for a bit extra rice/sauce/meat she'll oblige without charge!)  def going back here if i'm in the area again, wish it was in my neighborhood (yonge/eg) so i could frequent it more often. :)) around $8 per person including a drink  must try: jerk chicken (of course) with oxtail gravy (they insist), curried goat roti wrap and TING (sooooooo good and refreshing!!)"}
{"text":"Ordered through uber eats. The medium jerk chicken was very small. 2 tiny drum sticksand a tiny thigh. I also made a special note for coleslaw only and was given rice (I have an allergy so couldn't eat it) the food was decent but wouldn't order again"}
{"text":"This place is simply great at what it does; no-frills Jamaican food.  The lunch deal is one of the better values in the city and certainly in the neighborhood.  The jerk chicken is very good and always very fresh (it flies out of there) and unlike many places, their boneless chicken curry has some real flavor.  What's really nice is that in an era when most places skimp and save at your expense, the roti you take home will be stuffed with goodness - to the max!   Mostly take out, but you can eat in if walking is an issue (yes, I'm talking to you hangover girls!)  BONUS - Extra large coconut water to replace the electrolytes you lost.  All the good stuff - cheap, hot, and fast.  Open late when you need it most..."}
{"text":"Went to get food last night and the quantity of food has drastically dropped. The size of the chicken was really small. for a large got 4 tiny legs. Was not filling at all. Really pricey for a Jerk chicken place. Try Annie's Cuisine So much better jerk chicken there."}
{"text":"I love Jerk King! Perfect spice and so authentic... Juicy chicken, delicious coleslaw... what more can I say? Go try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly but their English isn't the best. Their card machines weren't working and so I had to break a 50 for a $7 meal. The food had a very authentic taste and was definitely a worthy meal for such a low price. I would've preferred if they had labels on their food so I knew what I was looking at instead of guessing"}
{"text":"There are two Jerk Kings on Bloor,this was the first. It was Garvey's Jerk when it first opened. The jerk is pretty good but a tad tomatoey for me. I prefer the fry chicken with oxtail or goat gravy on the rice and peas. This place is open to 2:30 am generally. The one at Bloor and Bathurst is open till 1:30 and they run out of most stuff before then."}
{"text":"They recently hired a girl about a month or so ago who was working today (Saturday April 23rd around 3:50 PM), her customer service is outrageously horrible. Everything from sneering at customers, actively looking for confrontation, as well as poor multitasking (serving a customer and then leaving there food on the counter for several minutes as she ignores them and moves to the next). As a regular for three years I have never been displeased with the service provided. However after dealing with her work ethic and rude demeanour I will never be frequenting that location again."}
{"text":"Decent jerk chicken at fair prices The place may not wow you but it fills a craving. I Find the Bloor/Dufferin location to be a little more satisfying."}
{"text":"Not a real fan of the Jerk here, but the fried chicken with some Oxtail gravy is pretty good.  Looking for fried chicken without having to resort to Popeye's across the street, this is a decent choice."}
{"text":"How can anybody compliment or love this establishment.... by far WORST jerk chicken in Toronto, might aswell just call it \"bbq chicken\". Orders are also served with a side of \"coleslaw\" which consists of 85% mayonnaise and 15% cabbage (just shows how cheap all their food is). Anybody who claims to love this place and praise their food has never had authentic jerk chicken/Jamaican in their LIFE !   Asides from the food this place is horrendous mess, cramped; and it just seems like the owners of this place do not care or attempt at providing quality for their customers"}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" is an accurate review for this place.  I popped in here during my lunch break one day in late summer (yes my review is horribly late) but what i remember vividly (aside from service being terrible compared to their other location): - there were Bee's everywhere in the restaurant that people sitting down (or waiting in line) couldn't be there peacefully - there was no AC - i literally felt like i was baking in a sauna  - the debit machine wasn't working and she had to keep resetting it - the food wasn't flavourful - esp compared to their other location - they ran out of veggie options  not a location i would return too for Caribbean food!"}
{"text":"If you're reading this you're stumbling out of a nearby bar wondering what's still open. Jerk King is still open and the food is awesome. Go to Jerk King and soak up those $4 rail shots you've been pounding. Thank me later."}
{"text":"The food was pricy compared to Mainsha another Caribbean food chain. I had the chicken roti and it was good. My daughter had the fried chicken meal, the rice and peas tasted as though they forgot to add salt or seasoning."}
{"text":"Quick Carribean comfort food. Extremely good food for their special price. AMAZING coleslaw."}
{"text":"Our stop over to get some food while on the way to a concert, Jerk King was just the place to find home made style West Indian fare. It was around 11 on a Saturday night and the restaurant was empty, cold, and dark. But walking the stretch to the back of the room revealed a huge selection of dishes that could be combined to whatever you wanted. I only had a beef patty but it was nice! Thin, and crispy with just the right amount of grease. One lone woman was serving up food, and she looked stylish in a beautiful red dress. A memorable trip down Bloor St."}
{"text":"The Jerk here is surprisingly moist and tender. The portions are decent and the prices are on par with the competition nearby. It's got a tiny seating area so it's best for takeout. I've had their curry chicken, Jerk chicken, Jerk wrap, Beef patties, and those donut looking desserts here at this location. Everything was delicious and consistent each time. Except for the curry chicken was dry. One star off for that but 4stars def for everything else. Its also nice it's open super late."}
{"text":"So after a night out it's nice to have a place that's open late to buy food from. It's not gourmet or anything so don't set your expectations too high, but after a few drinks, it was just what I needed. Note that you have to get exactly what's on the menu they don't let you customize your order even if you're willing to pay more"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now and feel well acquainted with the menu enough to give a good review. Was looking forward to Jerk King opening for a while as there are very few Caribbean restaurants in my area and often have to drive down to eglinton to get it. I Have tried the curry goat, jerk chicken and curry chicken on rice. I like the food here but the meat quality is not great, often will find big chunks of fat or gristle instead of good meat chunks. The chef could definitely be a little more diligent in prep to trim the less than edible portions. Food is usually a bit on the salty side and a bit expensive for what you receive. Most dishes are just rice with a spoon of whatever you order and a small coleslaw on the side. I lived on the west end for a couple of years and have had quite a bit of Caribbean cuisine. I would say this restaurant is slightly below average overall but some dishes are better than others."}
{"text":"The jerk Chicken tastes like bbq chicken honestly . I got the large jerk chicken (you get 4 large pieces of chicken ) , lots of rice and a little tin of coleslaw (that's mostly mayo) . I even asked for spicy sauce and it was sweet like bbq. All in all it's alright but not the place for ppl looking for REAL CARIBBEAN FOOD or REAL JERK CHICKEN."}
{"text":"Absolutely agree with all the top reviews posted here.  Real bonus is they're open REALLY late. Great if you are working nights and are nearby. At that hour the small jerk chicken has always been enough for me. Just the perfect amount of heat."}
{"text":"Jerk king is awesome. We were able to get atleast 4 meals worth of food for 30 dollars which is unheard of! I love the plantains they have and beef patties.. Soo delicious!!! Service is fast and friendly. Flavours are always delicious, you just can't go wrong! My favourite caribean good by far!!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place at least twice a month for a long time. The quality hasn't changed much in the past few years even since it's name change. I usually get the jerk chicken with rice and peas and curry goat gravy. Love it. The jerk chicken isn't like the usual jerk chicken, it's a bit more saucy and also a little sweet too compared to other jerk chicken places. The rice and peas is nutty and flavourful on its own, I really like the rice here and haven't found a jerk chicken place with better rice and peas.   I also usually get it with curry goat, as I find the oxtail a bit too sweet for my liking, and I find the curry goat to be a bit thicker which I also enjoy.   Their fried chicken is also pretty good but I rarely get it, pretty much stuck on the same combo.   I used to get the chick peas here and they are also really nice, especially if you do half rice and half chick peas.   Their beef patties are also very tasty, not sure how they cook them but they are always very flaky and buttery.   One of my favourite places in toronto, for sure."}
{"text":"4 stars for very friendly staff, huge portions and a great deal for your dollar.   I have ordered both the curry chicken and the jerk chicken.   Both are great and I like to alternate, though I order the curry chicken more often.  A few ways to improve before I give it 5 stars is A) needs more air conditioning and B) the music player is a radio that doesn't have the station set correctly, causing the patrons to hear static."}
{"text":"I am predictable with my late night eats. Small jerk chicken, please. Two pieces of tender chicken with rice and beans covered in spicy gravy (or sometimes the oxtail gravy) combined with the creamy coleslaw.   Sure, I love the barbequed freshness of a Rasta Pasta lunch in Kensington, and indeed there are better known jerk spots around town, but Jerk King is my late-night takeout spot and it tastes like home.   I am always content with my decision, whether I'm picking it up after a late night at my office, post dance shenanigans or maybe it's Wednesday and it's on special for dinner ($6.05 with tax). I probably sound quite boring, but this is one of my comfort foods.  Somehow, every single time they ask if you want the coleslaw with your meal. This seems like a rhetorical question. OF COURSE YOU WANT THE COLESLAW."}
{"text":"Yey another Caribbean option in my hood ... not sure which one I prefer jerk king or allwayne... jerk kings is more saucy and allwayne is dryish... oddly I added both of them to yelp... I liked jerk king because hey have a medium option portion is fair... will return"}
{"text":"Dingy place, I came here for the 5 dollar jerk chicken special and it came with beans and rice,  gravy,  coleslaw and two pieces of jerk chicken.  The chicken was super yummy and was a bit sweet!  The rice portion was huge,  I couldn't finish it. .. especially because I got the hot sauce on it which I didnt enjoy. I sat facing Bloor St so I had a very good dining experience.  Will stop by again when I'm in the area. If you feel like eating Caribbean food,  this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Came here end of day- this might have changed the situation- Chicken was dry and the jerk sauce was VERY spicy (which is good!- but I just think a result of the stew sitting there all day. $7 for a small jerk chicken meal during non-special lunch hours.  Service this time around was fine- I've never had bad service here but I know it's always a crapshoot at these places who you get.  I'd come back start of day to see if there was anything different- but this is just a note, probably don't come end of day as the chicken becomes quite dry."}
{"text":"They forgot my coleslaw, the jerk chicken wasnt even jerk chicken, it was some oily and spicy disgusting chicken swimming in some nasty curry sauce.The rice and peas were dry and had no seasoning at all. The worst part of the meal was the dumpling because it had nothing in it! It was just a dry ball of dough. The patty was not bad bad also nothing special and not worth the money, go somewhere else and save your money!!!!!"}
{"text":"Jerk King opened a new location in North York, very happy about this! There's finally a good carribean restaurant in my area!   Prices are fair, large portions, food is delicious. I tried the curry chicken roti and jerk chicken meal (comes with rice and peas and a side of coleslaw). Curry chicken and jerk chicken were flavorful, seasoned very well with a little heat, just enough spiciness to give it a kick but not too overwhelming that it burns!   Give it a try, it's a nice change from the typical Asian restaurants and dessert/bubble tea shops that populate this area. I think this will be my new go to place for carribean food."}
{"text":"I've been craving jerk chicken for the longest time and since it was raining I gave up on trying to find the best jerk chicken in North York and settled for this as it is very easy to find since it's facing Yonge street.   I didn't have high expectations but I was pretty disappointed. The jerk chicken wasn't spicy and was more like a thick sweet BBQ sauce just put on top as the inside wasn't really marinated. The coleslaw was alright but was too creamy. The rice and peas weren't bad, but I've definitely had better. For around $9 for a medium size, the portion could have been better. It was 2 small drum sticks (emphasis on small) and 1 small thigh."}
{"text":"Was referred here by stranger at a show at Lee's Palace, which is across the street.  Let's just say you won't be disappointed, they're sauces are delicious with the right amount of heat.  Was disappointed they ran out of the oxtail, Was told it was the best around.  Services is friendly, not the fastest but who cares, good food is woth waiting for. Next time I'm in Toronto again I will definitely be stopping in.  Fyi it's even better the next day!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Caribbean restaurant, open well past midnight on the traficked corner of Bloor and Dufferin next to the subway station, this is the place I come to whenever I a) want Jamaican food or b) am hungry late at night. The bare-bones storefront location is a bit of a turn-off, though."}
{"text":"Ordered a few times and now it's a go-to for me. Food is consistently good. Their coleslaw  is the best!"}
{"text":"a bit disappointing, jerk chicken tasted more like a barbeque sauce, mixed with some jerk element.  Definitely not a traditional jerk. Coleslaw tasted a bit off, had a bad after taste, was oversauced, barely tasted the slaw, more of a mushy texture. Also, there was a massive hair in my food.  Got this from Just Eat, never doing that again."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place regularly for a few months and am never disappointed.  I usually get the medium Jerk chicken with rice, peas and coleslaw for about $9.50 total and rarely do I ever finish the whole thing in one sitting (usually leftover 1 leg and some rice.  I'm 5'9 155lbs for reference).  The serving comes with 2 legs (small to medium size) and 1 thigh with a decent amount of rice and peas and coleslaw on the side.  The sauce is fairly spicy (even the mild) and leans more toward the sweet side.  Overall, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have the best jerk chicken, rice, coleslaw, patties and plantain!   Very reasonable prices and excellent value. Would definitely recommend this place for those who want a good jerk chicken fix. More of a take-out restaurant. There are places to sit but it's not very big/accommodating.   They're also open very late."}
{"text":"Mindblowing jerk goodness at Yonge and Sheppard!! Just tried this place and it blew my tastebuds away!! I got the medium plate (at max spice) with coleslaw. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and cooked just right! As a fan of spicy food, I was absolutely impressed with the rich/complex flavours in the accompanying jerk sauce. As the other reviewer had indicated, the sauce is spicy with tonnes of flavour as opposed to \"mindless\" spice. Shoutout to the awesome coleslaw as well :) A perfect way to wrap up the meal!  I've tried quite a number of jerk chicken spots around the city and this is certainly up there on the list. Super excited that these guys are just around the corner and moreso that the food is a fresh break from all the other - somewhat similar - restaurants in the neighborhood.   p.s. for those who are familiar with the food court in the building, this is hands down the jerk chicken place to beat!"}
{"text":"Excellent value and some of the best jerk chicken in the city as far as I am concerned! I love their jerk sauce and get it on the chicken AND the rice! It is spicy in just the right way. The lunch special is great value and I have tried both the Jerk King at Bloor and Dufferin and Bloor and Bathurst and they are both equally good. I go here often (sometimes TOO often) and have recommended it to many friends who agree that this place is one of the best and cheaper than the rest!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great but delivery is below standards. Twice I've order through a food ordering app (once Skip the Dishes, the other Just Eat) and my orders were incomplete. I did not receive coleslaw either time (even though it is part of the order with pick up/dine in), and the last time they ignored a note about gravy on the rice so we ended up with dry rice and dry chicken. If they cannot offer the same level of service with delivery, they should not offer delivery."}
{"text":"Love the beans mixed into the rice here it's so flavourful. I ordered the jerk chicken dinner. The jerk chicken isn't spicy at all here and they give you a generous amount for the price. Definetly gonna be my go to place now"}
{"text":"This place is perfect if you like slop,salmonella and improperly seasoned food. The only good thing about this place is that it is open late, however the under cooked chicken and anorexic goat pretty much takes away from that. I ordered(via UberEATS) and was very disappointed with what the restaurant sent. For starters we ordered 2 roti, one goat the other chicken. The containers with the  roti's where not labeled. Causing us to sort through the sloppy excuse for a roti, when we found the chicken roti it was a whole slab of chicken. Upon cutting into it we found pink meat(I didn't realize salmonella was a side option) then I opened the curry goat which was more bone than goat, feeling for a bit more I asked my wife to share her goat roti, I expected for a \"king\" to deliver a top notch roti instead I was stuck eating slop, when I called to complain, the phone call went unanswered(thankfully Uber eats answered my call and dealt with the situation in a professional manner)"}
{"text":"For what it is, this place is good. It's definitely a takeout joint, with one small table and maybe five chairs, but there is a food court in the building. The food is flavourful, the portions are good (although there's not much difference between the medium and the large, so you might as well go for the cheaper one) and the rice and peas and coleslaw are good. I've also tried the rum cake and cassava cake and they were pretty good renditions - very moist.  The one downside I can think of is that the spicy isn't spicy at all, so if you're into that, you're out of luck here.  Great option for the office drones and/or TTC devotees in the area (right next to Sheppard Station)."}
{"text":"Though definitely not the best place for jerk chicken, portions are pretty good for the price. The best thing is it is open really late: superior alternative to McDonalds across the street."}
{"text":"I always have cravings for their jerk chicken. Their gravy sauce is amazing and I love how spicy it is! The ladies working there are all very nice and give a generous amount. The rice and beans is always very good too. A large is more than enough for 1 person.  One less star only because there is not a lot of seating and I wish that the pricing is a little lower. It is quite expensive."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I really love the food and my SO and I are regulars here. Jerk chicken is our go to dish and usually we are served by a nice middle aged woman. I went on Dec 3 around 4pm and I guess they recently hired a younger African American girl.   When I arrived, there were 3 customers in front of me. She was currently serving a middle aged man, they were very chummy and they kept smirking at eachother throughout the 10 minutes it took to prepare his chicken roti. Basically, he kept asking for more chicken, and she kept complying. Cool, I'm all for big portions and good prices. However, what bothered me was when she asked \"do you want chick peas on it too?\", he responded with \"nah I don't like that shit\", and the employee giggled and said \"yeah I don't like that shit either\". Don't even get me started about when they were at the cash register. I've NEVER seen 2 individuals giggle and bond so well over chicken! Oh, he also tipped her personally, as I saw him hand her the change into her hand in such a loving manner.   10 minutes later, she came and served the 2 guys in front of me. They were quicker. She kept smiling at them too, it was really uncomfortable. Perhaps they knew eachother, because when they went to the cash, he asked her for a free double and she happily obliged, no questions asked.   When it was finally my turn, I got a \"hey\" in the most robotic tone ever. No smile, no greeting, I literally lol'd and placed my order. From the point when I ordered to going to the cash register, not once was I acknowledged. Maybe I should have asked for some free food too?"}
{"text":"I would literally live inside the boneless jerk chicken container if I could, depending on rent. This place is amazing. Best flavours. Huge portions. Great price. Coleslaw is awesome. Roti is incredible. I haven't tried the fried chicken yet but I know it's good just from looking at it. Curry is so damn good.   Not great for dining in but if I lived near by I would never cook."}
{"text":"I was on Bloor St and looking for a place to grab a bite!  I decided to give this place a try as I was in the mood for some Roti.  I really am happy I did.   You get a really nice size portion and the food was excellent.  Nothing fancy and no frills about this place but it really hit the spot for me!"}
{"text":"I had a business meeting at CSI as we try to make some social change and afterwards I was hungry  Having had some awesome Chinese/Caribbean food I thought to go full tilt Jerk  I had a small plate ( seemed large to my eyes) of kidney beans and brown fried rice with extra gravy (askl for extra gravy) and stewed oxtail  I never ever had oxtail and I really liked it. It was juicy and flavorful and had the right amount of spice. I must eat more oxtail  the bonus was the coleslaw. Instead of it being shredded it was diced into small chunks with a really creamy dressing.  As I was driving home I thought.....hmmmmm....i may only make coleslaw that way going forward.  While eating they seemed to be doing a brisk business on patties...spicy ones  Hey Honest Ed's is like 50 yards away....they sell dread wigs for a dollar and rasta caps  Now the meal was $9.50 and they do have a lunch special good for really lunch hours...after 1pm the prices go up a bit...no worries bumbo clod   this is the real deal when it comes to Jerk"}
{"text":"Mainly a take-out spot.  Had a large Jerk Chicken with Rice and Peas and large Curry Goat with Rice and Peas.  Lady forgot to give me coleslaw for both and only realized when I got home.  Portion was alright for the price but quality of meat isn't the best.  The Jerk Chicken is very saucy.  I got spicy and the smell of scotch bonnet was strong but it wasn't really that spicy though.  Rice and peas were fine.  Standard and average.  I was hoping that they grilled their chicken but it's baked.  Hard to find Caribbean joints that grill their meats.  Curry Goat didn't have much flavour.  I wouldn't get again.  I was going to try a beef patty but the lady said it's not house-made and is from Patty King.  Disappointed and did not bother trying the generic mass produced patties.  With all that being said, Jerk King is a nice addition to the neighborhood.  It's one of only two Caribbean food joints in Willowdale.  The other is Allwyn's which is in the food court in the same building as Jerk King.  I would return since it's close by."}
{"text":"Food amount is right for the price. The jerk sauce has just enough spice and love how they put jerk sauce on the rice and the chicken.  Too good!"}
{"text":"Wanted something different from my usual poke bowl when I'm in the area. Decided to give Jerk King a try.   I opted for the small curry goat which came with your standard rice and peas and slaw. There was a generous portion of meat for a 'small' order. Nice to see some 'bone' too as it does add to the flavour of the dish.  I'd rate the overall dish  as 'average'. Nothing to wow the taste buds but still good enough to enjoy.   Service good, establishment clean.   Update 1/2018: Jerk chicken still good, portion generous. This time I opted for the addition of spicy gravy. Nice heat without being over the top. However it had a very strong tomato flavour which I personally didn't like. i felt it over powered the flavour of the jerk spice."}
{"text":"Location & Ambiance: Seems like a busy and small, hence a line forming quickly. Location is new, clean and easy to find.   Customer Service: The staff provided efficient service.  Food: I've never eaten from Jerk King so this was my fist time. Had the jerk chicken and rice and peas. Let me paraphrase by saying I'm Jamaican, born and raised.  The jerk chicken was saucy and sweet and not a delicious sweet either. After a few bites I couldn't eat anymore. Parts of the rice were tough. I was really an awful meal. I'd never recommend anyone eat there and I certainly would never eat there again."}
{"text":"Best Jerk chicken in the city....I may even go as far as North America! loll....  Get it while its fresh with extra cold coleslaw you will not forget it and want to be hungry again to do it all over.  Its not to spicy and just the right amount of sauces. Never dry like other Caribbean places. That's not only the good news, its also open very late and VERY affordable....  $10 or less with a drink will get you full..."}
{"text":"The food is really good quality and value, albeit simple. The service has improved recently."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a mid-afternoon bite, and was a little disappointed to find that they were out of jerk chicken.  Luckily, they had some in the oven and we had only wait 10 minutes before we were served.  So for $10 we were served four pieces of piping hot jerk chicken, one large plate of rice and beans with a generous helping of gravy, and one coleslaw.  Good value.  The coleslaw was yummy (perhaps the best I've had), the rice with gravy was so tasty, and the chicken was pretty good as well... except it *wasn't* jerk chicken!  It was like some kind of rotisserie or bbq chicken with a bit of a kick, but definitely not authentic jerk.  I don't know if this was a one-off (looking at the other reviews on here), or whether people just don't know what real jerk is.  Strangely, in other respects the place was very authentic and had a true Jamaican vibe.  I'm willing to give this place another shot, but the jerk here cannot compare with the stuff I had at the Ritz located at Yonge & College.  You know, the kind with the strong flavorful jerk spices, and the meat that just falls off the bone."}
{"text":"Uber alert. I love the food at Jerk King but if you order via Über you will be disappointed. They don't give you a mini coleslaw with your order (as would happen in store) and they don't put gravy on the rice and peas (you would be asked which of three sauces you wanted in store). Dry rice and no coleslaw with jerk chicken? Is this real life? Tonight was the third strike. So walk over, and get some amazing food. Just don't use Über to order it."}

{"text":"Three automatic yelp stars for being open Sunday night midnight and serving authentic carribbean food. Seems like an easy feat but I guarantee you this is one of the great wonders of the 6ix - I don't know many other cities in Canada where u can go get jerk chicken, fried chicken, four different types of roti, plantain, Channa and et cetera on Sunday at midnight.   Food was fairly good even when in a sober state so another star for that plus the super affordability ($15.30 = small jerk + rice & peas, small fried chicken + r&p, side plantain, side channa, side steamed rice and side patty - friend caved in and got the patty SMH).   1 star off cuz plantain was stale and patty looked kinda risky... meh, there's always a trade off for late eats. And interestingly enough, tips were not very much 'welcomed' you could say. Guess I'll keep the change next time.   FYI, If you're not hungry and just really need to urinate there's a big ol bathroom downstairs to do your business. Who doesn't love a private downstairs bathroom?!"}
{"text":"This is A PRIME example of a great location..  The food is mediocre, at best!  Over priced, slow, terrible interior.  People eat it, usually busy. No other decent JERK around, so this is what you get."}
{"text":"Not exactly a great jerk chicken. It was very saucey, tasted very sweet and it was a bit BBQ sauce tasting. It did not taste like it was cooked on the BBQ; it tasted more like it was slow cooked in the sweet \"jerk\" sauce.  The coleslaw was ok, basically coleslaw swimming in a mayo/sour cream mixture.  Very over priced for the quantity."}
{"text":"Hands down the most savoury and well cooked jerk chicken in Toronto.   I've had jerk chicken in 6 different locations across Toronto; I've found that this is the tastiest and most generous in portions.   If you're looking for well priced, filling and fast paced good Caribbean food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The chicken was really juicy and the skin was great. The flavours were amazing. Why not a 5 rating? Because the jerk chicken wasn't as spicy as I'd normally think it should be. The staff was very friendly and the price was very reasonable. $5 for a jerk chicken with rice lunch portion that I couldn't even finish!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for about 3 years. The chicken 2 years ago was great. But what they serve now has decreased in quality and quantity but increased in price. The jerk chicken is very small. Looks like a chicken wing. Sometimes it is burnt and hard. Chicken shouldnt hard to chew and tough. The rice is dry and hard like it's been sitting there for too long. I will stop going here. There are too many other good spots to settle for this."}
{"text":"Rapport Quality price Fair !  Test just like home cooking highly recommend this place !"}
{"text":"You can rely on this food tasting delicious every time. Up until 3AM. Def a go to spot for fried chicken, coleslaw, rice and peas."}
{"text":"Food was great! I ordered a medium jerk plate, and couldn't finish it in one sitting. I wish the place itself had more light and options (ie cabbage and curry), but we were there on a holiday (New Years day) so I appreciate the fact that they were open. The lady serving us was helpful and I wish customs would have let me take my leftovers back to the states."}
{"text":"The first time I ever tried jerk chicken was from here five years ago. My friend introduced it to me. I was thrilled how amazing it tasted. Juicy, tender, spicy, flavourful and the cole slaw was so creamy.   Saw a jerk chicken place on queen west yesterday and immediately got a craving. Unfortunately the chicken there was very disappointing and it made me miss this place.   I googled Bathurst and bloor jerk chicken and this place showed up just as I remembered. I came today after a long day at work. Ordered small oxtail. OMG. Too damn good. Now I'm fomo-omg the chicken. Maybe I should get another box. Can't believe this place got lower review than the other one on Queen. I need to contribute and boost the rating. Memorable and comforting."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Always friendly and their boneless chicken rotis are massive and taste great. If you are in a rush you might get frustrated since they usually have only one person doing everything but I am usually not in a hurry when I go there. Highly recommended. Honest, simple and genuine."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place opened up. I miss the late night sushi I enjoyed previously but I would have it no other way....there is only a billion sushi places in annex...-.-  This is the SH*T man. Delicious, and inexpensive. Perfect portion.  It's not somewhere you go for ambiance but if you need to feed yourself after drinks or try some delicious Jamaican food, this is it."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed after reading the reviews then visiting this place. I really wanted this place to be good. I ordered a curry chicken roti and a small jerk chicken dinner. Staff was friendly enough and the service was good but what they consider jerk chicken isn't really jerk chicken. It was covered in, what seemed to be bbq sauce, with a hint of jerk flavor. I'm not a fan of saucy jerk chicken. That's what the oxtail gravy over my rice n peas' for. The oxtail gravy was good enough. The curry chicken was decent. Nothing that'll have me rushing back if I have a craving though. The homemade hot sauce was a hit. Nice and spicy.  Get the one from the big bottle and not the little containers. All in all, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"You're hungry, it's hella late, you love carbs and protein... Jerk King is your place! Food can be a little inconsistent, I think it depends on when they last refreshed the dish you pick on the hot table. For example, the rice and peas can be wet or dry. A few times I think it was a bit undercooked. Ditto the roti skins...sometimes it's better than others. But generally my craving is satisfied. My go-to is the curry goat on rice and peas. Yeah, I'm a little addicted to the goat! Decent take-out place with tables to eat in if you must."}
{"text":"\"Teach me - Teach me - Teach me how to jerk\"  I'm probably being too generous here with the stars - but coming from a place where good Carribean food is non-existent (Vancouver): I'm am eating here a ton in my first month in Toronto.  I mean - I find it hard to walk by here and not stop in for something.  So I like 'Jerk King' a lot... [pause].  The jerk chicken is the show stopper here but they also offer a $11 plate special (they raised the price from $10 recently) - where you can pick from any four of their items (i.e. fried chicken, curry goat, beef stew, fish, etc.).  $1.50 Jamaican patties and a $4.50 lunch special everyday.  It's cheap.  The only knock is the line-ups - they work pretty slow and it's usually busy in here.  And it's a bit ghetto - but seriously, if that matters to you, you have no business being here.  But that jerk chicken - woo - spicy and moist.  So good.  Like Costanza, I like my chicken spicy."}
{"text":"their food is good but sometimes taste a bit dry. got their plantain and it was not fresh at all, it was hard to chew. I asked the lady if they were going to make a fresh batch and she said no, i told her it was really dry and she didn't do anything about it. the jerk chicken and rice was alright. kind of felt that they were really stingy on the portions of the food which was pretty obvious by observing them putting the food in the containers.. overall 2.5-3 stars. they should also start coming out where the tables are cause theres always a mess of leftover sauce and rice on the tables or leftover containers previous customers leave. :/"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken with rice and peas.. With oxtail gravy is the shiznit here. Prices are pretty good for the amount you get too."}
{"text":"This is a smaller store with not that much seating. I also found the medium to be quite small for $9. However, the jerk chicken was really flavorful and the rice was fluffy and good! Chicken was not dry at all. I think this is a great place for take out!"}
{"text":"This is my fav friendly neighbourhood jerk joint. Pre-warning - don't say the name too fast or out loud.   Delivery, takeout, you name it. It's HELLA busy. Always a line. BUT that's a good sign. Yes?   Their jerk chicken & coleslaw are my go-to. The jerk chicken is mild and slightly sweet but has a kick. The real trick though is alternating between bites of jerk chicken meat and bites of coleslaw. Party. In. Your. Mouth. Nom nom."}
{"text":"Came here and ordered a small jerk chicken with rice and peas for take out, $7.50 including taxes. The chicken skin was burnt so i couldn't really taste the jerk flavour. The oxtail gravy on the rice made the meal taste so much better. The meal came with coleslaw and it was drenched in mayo."}
{"text":"First time trying this spot. Amazing prices with quick service, excellent portions and very good food! For the price I'd definitely recommend to anyone looking for hearty caribbean food. We ordered 1 medium jerk chicken and 1 medium oxtail dinner- it was more than enough and we even had leftovers. I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Does anyone have the phone number for this restaurant?  I've eaten here many times and the food is incredibly flavourful!  I would love to promote this place to close friends but can't find a business phone number anywhere online."}
{"text":"I ordered the chana with rice and peas. The size small is very reasonable for the price and the chana gravy was thick and flavourful! A great vegetarian option that is filling, affordable, and delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried the jerk chicken there, small size is $6.20 comes with 2 pieces of chicken and rice. Also tried their beef patty, fried dumpling and fried plantains. It was all decent. open until 3am"}
{"text":"I never really pay attention to this place till one day it was late and this is one of the few options. This might not be the traditional type of jerk chicken, but none the less succulent and decadent. It has this BBQ sauce gives it this sweetness caramelized taste, and it roasted to the point the skin is so tender it fall apart from the meat, that is where the flavour resides. I love having it over rice and beans with chickpea curry. And don't forget the best part - the spicy gravy, it is rather spicy and again a hint of sweetness goes so very the rice."}
{"text":"Not an expert on carribean cuisine so I can comment on the authenticity of the jerk chicken, but I can say it was very flavourful. Came here and ordered the large jerk chicken, which came with 4 pieces of chicken, rice with beans and coleslaw. Chicken had a nice kick to it and a bit of a sweet bbq flavour. Portion was pretty big, enough food for 2 small meals."}
{"text":"The food here is very good!  I had Jerk Chicken which was so deliciously spiced and done perfectly, tasty rice and peas with mild oxtail gravy, fried plantain and beef patty.  Everything was very good that I absolutely enjoyed and would have ordered more if I can eat more.    I would definitely go back and recommend this place.  The only down side for me is the place is tiny, they have few chairs but it's pretty much for take out."}
{"text":"So good!!  The jerk chicken is very flavorful and portion size is very generous.  I also highly recommend the flan and the fried plantains."}
{"text":"There's very little that's kingly about the Jerk King, I've only stumbled in here as a last resort when some of the other local fare has closed, and when I can't stomach any Tim Horton's. I've been here roughly 5 times in 6 years which kind of shows my willingness to give them another shot.  Very little is actually prepared fresh, and the fillings are at times rancid smelling when they are taken out of the fridge to be reheated repeatedly. To be honest, I'm surprised how long it takes (18 minutes) to prepare a chickpea roti when all of their items are in the fridge including store bought roti skins. The two stars are for the decent portion sizes and great home made hot sauce. The spice blends are actually pretty good, but it would be better if the food was a bit more fresh."}
{"text":"Standard Caribbean food to be found here - but the portions are huge. The roti is loaded. I haven't had this great value in a while."}
{"text":"We ordered from here on uberEats and got the jerk chicken, oxtail, and curried goat. The jerk chicken was probably the best part of the meal, the flavors were on point but it was a bit sweet for my liking. The curried goat was good but nothing to write home about. The oxtail was absolutely boring and flavorless... Being the most expensive item on the menu, I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Jerk King because I was in the area and it was a pleasant surprise. In a nice change of pace from a lot of jerk spots, all the food is displayed out front behind the glass and it looks amazing. I got a medium box with a fried piece and a jerk piece with rice and peas. If you like hot stuff as much as me, opt for the  extra hot gravy. The chicken was delicious, although a little dry I have no complaints. The spicy gravy was what really made this place standout for me. The curry chicken, goat and oxtail also looked great, and I'd be surprised if I don't make my way back down here soon to try them too."}
{"text":"Jerk King's  jerk chicken does taste kingly. It's nicely done, moist and the outer coating of spices is delicious(although distinctly different from the Real Jerk's which I prefer). For folks wanting spicier stuff ask for their hot sauce: it's a secret recipe and packs quite a stinging punch!  I've found the curry goat and curry chicken to be flavorless, a bit bland: there are spices in there but the combination of ingredients just doesn't do it for me. I feel as though there is something missing.  The fried tilapia when eaten fresh is quite a delight.I hear the oxtail curry is quite nice, but have not tried it myself.  This is a no frills establishment with very limited seating, but have unlimited patrons craving copious amounts of jerk chicken till the wee hours (2-3 am) of the morning!   Cheap and open long? A-OK!"}
{"text":"Odd place, but generally good.   I have only eaten one thing from here which is the chicken-roti which is huge and loaded! The roti is always great tasting, however, both my friends have complained on multiple occasions that the rice isn't very good. They said is was dry and under-seasoned, to which I verified this.   The service is always good except for once, when I was served by a very rude Jamaican lady who made it seem like I was bothering her by ordering and she kept rolling her eyes at me. But besides that, the service is spot-on!"}
{"text":"Small Caribbean fast food joint, one table for two and five stools by the window.  Endless line during my recent dine-in, this place is quite popular.  I've tried the Jerk Chicken before, too burnt and dry for my taste.  I do enjoy their Boneless Curry Chicken on a bed of rice and peas, not too spicy and still flavourful.  For a small joint, I appreciate the variety of dishes they offer here."}
{"text":"I liked this place!   We ordered a small jerk chicken, two pieces of the fried chicken and a fried bread dumpling, I'm not sure what this was called! The lady serving us was really sweet but it took her a while to put the food together and punch the order into the computer. I'll chalk this up to them being new.   The jerk chicken was pretty good. Very different from what I've had before. The sauce has more of a sweet barbecue flavour as opposed to the savory jerk flavour that I'm used to, it was good, just not what I was expecting. It was spicy and flavourful. The rice wasn't great, it was overcooked and was lacking flavour. Hopefully this is something that will be improved over time, or maybe we had an off day. The fried chicken was not bad. I don't love that this is pre-cooked and kept on a hot plate. Fried chicken should really be fresh, but I guess it's not a fried chicken restaurant so I shouldn't be expecting much. I think my favourite part of the meal was the bread dumpling that we got. We got one fresh from the oil or oven. It was warm and yeasty tasting, crunchy on the outside and fluffy and doughy on the inside. I'm not sure if it would be as good if it's been sitting for a while but the one we had was delicious!   Everything in this restaurant is pre-made so I expect once in a while someone will get something not as fresh tasting. I get that jerk chicken can't really be made to order but fried chicken or those dough dumplings are probably better freshly made.   There are a number of options and stews and side dishes that look really interesting, like fried plantains, and patties, so I'll likely be back to try something else.  The restaurant is brand new and super clean. It's a takeout joint so not a lot of places to sit. Prices are on par with other places in the area. You can get a decent meal for around $10.  Overall decent, I'll probably be back because it's quick, clean and tasty and prices are pretty decent!"}
{"text":"Delicious jerk chicken and oxtail with rice. I love the fragrance of rice and it's tasty. Service is good and quick. I usually have dinner here after work. Fried plantains are yummy with sweet taste."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken ain't the greatest but they have the blessest roti. There's a small area to sit down and eat, so plan on taking your food home. Staff is cool and price is right."}
{"text":"The medium size here isn't as big as other place but it's still good. The prices are affordable and the workers are extremely nice. The jerk chicken is a bit spicier compared to others, but yummy nonetheless. I love the coleslaw and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"If you just need to calorie load than ok as th portion was generous. However everything was too sweet even the \"spicy\" gravy. The jerk chickn was cold and super dry. Mayb for $8 for 3 piece chcken dinner i cant expect more."}
{"text":"Need lunch for under a fin? For $4.50 you can get the daily lunch special from his Carribean majesty, the Jerk King. Yesterday (Tuesday) was Stew Chicken and Rice which comes in a square container that weighs about a pound and comes with a teeny portion of coleslaw or beans. I also threw in a spicy beef patty for $1.50. I can't resist those things.  There isn't much of an ambience here (the Bob Marley on repeat must be murder for the staff) so I took my order to go. The chicken was tender, and the rice was pretty flavorful too. I was hoping for something a little spicier (though the patty had a little bit of kick), but the flavours were pretty satisfying and the portion size was too.   With daily specials (and plenty of options beyond) I'm sure I'll be back upon their doorstep soon. (Singing sweet songs... blah, blah, blah.)  Obligatory Title Pun: The JERK KING's meat can't be beat.  Menu Readability: Pictures of meat!  Need to mention: They take debit and credit.  What this place teaches me about myself: I know better than to subject myself to the music of Bob Marley."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place soo much since it's close to my work and even though the food was just OK  and more of a 2 stars I gave it 3 stars. The rice was over cooked so a bit too mushy. The chicken wasn't jerk seasoning they seemed to have mixed it with BBQ sauce so it was a bit sweet. The gravy also had a bit of sweetness that just made the overall flavoring sweeter than I would have preferred. The cole slaw was really wet so I had to drain the mayo sauce it was drenched in. Lastly and sadly the beef patty was soggy. They really should keep it in a warmer and not in the buffet window with all the other foods where it gets steamed and soggy."}
{"text":"For $11.50 after tax can get you a large ( 4 pieces of chicken, rice and a choice of salad or coleslaw )   Jerk chicken was tender and spicy. Rice and beans was very good. I should have ordered the medium because the portion is huge.   Service was great and fast. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Unpretentious, bad-ass Jerk Chicken.   There are 3 tables to sit and chow down if you are famished, and a courtesy sink to use if you are inclined to eat jerk chicken properly, ie. with your hands!   There isn't much ambiance and it's not really a sit down restaurant though, so my recommendation is, in the summer take your order walk 2 mins down the road to Duffrin Grove Park and eat it under the sun, sitting on the grass, like it's meant to be eaten. In the winter I usually grab take out and run home to eat it.  I visited Jamaica last year and had high hopes for the jerk chicken I would taste there. To my surprise, Jerk King put Jamaica's jerk chicken to shame! (granted i was at a '4 star' all inclusive...)  Anyways, if you live in the neighborhood, and always wondered it this place was any good, grab 10 bucks have your self a hearty meal and a 'ting' to wash it down. Delish.  Lunch special before 1pm is 6 bucks for rice/beans and 2 pieces jerk or fried chicken is a crazy good deal."}
{"text":"Mediocre \"jerk\"chicken at best.   Not sure if the jerk chicken was supposed to be super saucy but I was not expecting it, the sauce was more of a sweet sour BBQ sauce and I was expecting more of a jerk marinade savoury flavour on the chicken. I think the chicken was deep fried and then the sauce put on.   One thing that kind of turned me off of it was that the chicken had that taste that it was sitting there for a while under a hot light, which was quite possible because there was a mound of the chicken sitting in the display case.   Not sure I would go back for the jerk chicken as there are better options for jerk in the immediate area."}
{"text":"Their slaw is all mayo and if you order for a family it can get pricy, but daaaaamn I'm a big fan of their jerk chicken, extra sauce. Their rice and beans are perfect. Their chicken and oxtail are both fall-off-the-bone divine, and yeah, I'm a big fan. If you can't make it in, they're on uber eats.   Three cheers for chicken sans pants!   Hip hip hooray. Hip hip hooray. Hip hip hooray."}
{"text":"This Jerk King location just opened but it seems like they werent really ready.   While i was there there were 2 pairs of people before me.  The counter person was busy stacking the styrofoam containersvabove the counter and kept going to the back to put their order together.  It was a long wait so i went away for a few minutes and the people ahead of me were still waiting for their food.  I just got stuff that was in their front counter so my order was faster.  Seems there air conditioner wasnt working either.  It was as hot as Jamaica and the had a fan sitting on a table to cool the place.  It was cooler outside.  Some guy was busy shuffling photo boards on the tables in the centre so it really wasnt a place to stay and eat your food.  The chicken and dumpling i got was nothing special and the coleslaw was probably a commercially prepared slaw but it was good.  I think they need some help to make things more efficient.  I dont know if i will try ahain with a better Allwyns inside."}
