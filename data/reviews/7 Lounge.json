{"text":"Great music, great location, it's I think for people over 18years... sheesha was great too  server was nice but super slow and with slow I mean super slow on the end we had to wait 30min till she was ready to take our money.when we went there was this dj shake or something  did nice music but a bit to loud we I couldn't talk to my friends cause it was tooo loud they have fountain drinks and alcoholic.would prefer if they would serve non alcoholic cocktails too... else everything was fine we wanted to sit on the couches but the waitress told us apparently it's reserved but we noticed that the whole evening no one came to sit there so got little bit upset why they treating us like that anyways"}
{"text":"My first impression of 7 Lounge: upbeat and trendy interior decor, they have plenty of seating areas (including a patio) and lots of space between each table, I liked the fact that our party of 6 wasn't cramped up as I have experienced at other shisha places.   Staff: Our server was very friendly and helpful, I was extremely hungry and she recommended the Smoked Wings in Jerk spice which is their new flavour option with a side of BBQ ranch.  I also couldn't help but notice that our server was serving all the customers by herself while also manning the bar. It was basically a one-man-show, while the other servers were chatting amongst themselves. A bit of teamwork would've made the customer experience a much pleasant one.   Speed: She brought my beverage about 15 mins after I ordered and unfortunately it wasn't until another 30 mins later that I finally got my food. No longer hungry, I still wanted to give this place a chance & I must say, the food did not justify the wait time.   Menu: Orange Mint shisha was very good and lived up its expectations! Food presentation was great but a couple of the wings were soggy and slightly slimey so I decided not to eat those, I tried the other wings that looked more crispy and the meat was not fresh and honestly did not taste like chicken. The Jerk spice itself was good though and I did like their BBQ ranch dip. I tried their fries and they were missing the crispy element and tasted bland, no salt or seasoning.  Pricing: Their beverage pricing is a bit absurd, our friend ordered a Coca Cola and received what I would say is roughly 100ml for $3.25 the markup is insane for a 100ml soft drink. When we asked the server she advised they don't have the fountain drinks available today. In the event of a supply issue I would recommend the business to use good judgement on what they deem is a reasonable price for what they have available to offer as a substitute. I've posted a picture of the $3.25 glass of coke as well. This place could thrive but needs to improve their speed and the kitchen needs to implement better ways of preparing their dishes.  Recommendation to 7 Lounge: Please provide wet napkins to customers who order finger food or at the very least those who order bone-in chicken wings."}
{"text":"This shisha lounge knows how to set the mood right. Great ambiance with slick music! When I walk in, I just wanna flop on the comfy couches and relax.   Staff were helpful and attentive in showing us how to use the shisha tower. They came around every now and then to freshen up our coal for a smooth smoke. By now, you probably would've guessed it was my first time trying shisha, and 7 Lounge made it a cool experience. Good selection of flavors; mango was my favourite! Very appealing bar as well. One thing is it would be nice to have a drink menu for reference.   Since I was such a noob, I tried to put the tower on the table. And mind you, that's not a good idea because the ash could damage the surface. Anyway, a good smoke is not the only thing you can find here. The smokey chicken wings were superb. Excellent place to bring your board games and chill on a weekend.  I also learned how to make smoke rings here! Lots of fun!"}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was that it had an aesthetically appealing interior and exterior. It looked and felt like a proper nightlife lounge you'd find downtown. A+ for decor.  The shisha tower was of good value, spending about $25 and there's enough vapour to last the entire night for our group of 6.  I found the food quite delicious. We tried a couple flavours of wings and pulled pork tacos. The only drawback was that it was pretty pricey, but it kind of balances out if you consider the low price of shisha entertainment for the entire night.  I've read the other reviews of people complaining about the expensive small glass of Coke. It turns out that the Coke they served was from those small cute official coke glass bottles, which if served in the bottle, it would justify the price.   There is free parking in the lot, so don't worry about finding and paying for parking spaces.  7 Lounge has lots of potential, and I look forward to the improvements they'll make over time."}
{"text":"I came here with high hopes of finding a my new favourite shisha place unfortunately, this place left me desiring way more.   While our server was awesome everything else sadly wasn't so. Since they are fairly new many things that are typical of a shisha place and a restaurant aren't there. Unfortunately, many of these things come off as being very amateur. For example, they didn't receive their Coca-Cola syrup therefore forcing you to pay $3.25 for a glass bottle of coke that quite literally is half a glass.   While their menu is quite extensive many of their offerings that I sampled with my party were very sub-par and almost unacceptable. Their fries were quite odd tasting and lacked and sort of taste or crispiness. As a main I had their pizza which left me speechless in a sense where I couldn't comprehend how they would deem that acceptable to serve.   One good thing was their shisha. While flavour selection is limited, the actual flavour of the shisha was one of the better ones I have had. They mainly feature a selection of fruit biased flavours; I decided to go with their Mango flavour.   If you're in the area I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place. However, your experience may differ from mine."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends from Mississauga just to see how different this place can be from all the other lounges out there.  Service: Only one server was running the floor which was causing long delays in our food order. However, the server was very nice to everyone in our group.  It seemed like the other kitchen staff were just hanging out at the lounge after they delivered the shishas till the next order came through rather than assisting the server on the floor.  Food: This came to me as a big surprise for a place that would be hosting a Yelp! event soon. The food was very bland and lacked flavour. The fries seemed soggy and were drenched in salt. The rest of the food which took 45 minutes to come through for 4 people was unimpressive. You could taste/feel the frozen not fresh vibe.  Shisha: I always order one flavour and it was a hit! They have a few selections and everyone seemed to like it in our group.  Prices are average and be sure to check out the Yelp! offer after checking in. There are places out there that do not compromise on food quality and unfortunately today we were left dissatisfied with the quality here."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at 7 Lounge Shisha Bar. Located SE of Highway 7 and Pine Valley Drive, this cool spot offers delicious food, great music and the perfect spot to get my shisha fix :) It is also very spacious - perfect for large groups, and to host parties or private events!  The drinks menu is under construction but they can make anything you want. My friend and I order a Gin and Tonic ($7) - it was a nice cocktail to sip on while we do shisha!  7 Lounge offers delivery and pickup exclusively on SkipTheDishes. Be sure to take advantage of that. There will be a daily 7 at 7 promotion coming soon where you can enjoy food items listed for 7 dollars at 7 o'clock, and all day on Sundays - so stay tuned!  My 3 friends and I shared the following:  Shisha Tower ($18.95) - great value - the vapour will last you the whole night. I liked the blueberry mint flavour, but the mango one was definitely my favourite ;) Staff will come by to check and refill the coal for you... after a while, you will become a pro and easily do it yourself ;)  Smoked Pulled Pork Tacos ($16) - really tasty - the meat was juicy, tender and flavourful. It was made with in house smoked pulled pork, guacamole, pico di gallo, and dressed with sour cream and jalapenos. I would order this again!  Smoked Wings ($14) - must order - the maple honey garlic Sriracha flavour was my favourite! Buttery Buffalo is a popular flavour but it was too spicy for my liking. Btw, they do have their own smoker at the back of the house... it just makes everything taste so much better!  I would definitely recommend this lounge for the shisha... it was fun learning how to make smoke rings and other cool tricks! Food is on the pricey side but they do tasty very good - plus, the great value of the shisha tower definitely balances it out. I will be back again - keep up the great work, 7 Lounge!"}
{"text":"7 Lounge is a good place for a quick shisha and drinks, The shisha quality is mediocre, okay for a non-regular smoker... The bar here is a good plus, since most shisha places have no alcohol, Their burgers and tacos are delicious, had the portobello mushroom and the chorizo tacos!  They feature live dj on wknds, and it gets pretty crowded, so reservation is recommended. The crowd is mostly youth, so they get pretty loud pretty quick!  Service is alright, they can use a couple more servers, but they do a good job keeping up with their tables."}
{"text":"Went to this place with some friends to try out.  Nice lounge and chill area for friends to chat or enjoy some drinks together.  When we went they informed us that their drinks menu were still been made but they managed to mix a few specialty drinks that my friends requested.  It was an interesting place and I did enjoy the atmosphere that made a great place to just relax with some friends."}
