{"text":"This place is probably the best lunch for UT students on college str. Highly recommend the $10 (tax included) combo for pulled pork sandwich and soup. The server and owner are very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Amazing place for quick lunch/dinner!  The have this combo where you get a sandwich + fries or soup and drink for $8.85.  Must try their beef brisket and pulled pork sandwiches.  Tons of ingredients.  Also try their soup.  Everything seems to be homemade and very fresh!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today, and was pleasantly surprised. I had a great smoked chicken & brie wrap. The meat was juicy, the lettuce was fresh. and the overall taste was enhanced with a subtle saucy flavour. Nice touch with pine nuts (and dried cranberries for a touch of sweetness, I think ?). Generous size, too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I often come here with my boyfriend when we're at school. He absolutely loves the poutine and I normally grab the soup of the day + whatever is special. The owner is extremely passionate about food and is always checking up on his patrons. He has two menus - one that has your standard meals (pizza, sandwiches, fries and a massive pizza pocket thing) and a second with whatever he decides to make for the day.   I once walked in on an $10 rib special. It was a huge rack of ribs sprawled on top of home cut fries. He told me he saw the ribs while shopping at the market and decided to make them that day's special (since they were so fresh). That's something foodies LOVE to hear. Chef's who pick specials based on what they find at the market each day.    Most recently, I had the Camellia salad for $8 - it was HUGE! My plate was filled with mixed greens, sunflower seeds, dried cranberries, a massive portion of smoked chicken, caramelized onions and mushrooms! All topped off with a wonderful handful of cheese. DELICIOUS! I just had to review after I ate that amazing salad. I really hope he keeps it for the rest of summer!   Being able to eat quality food between draining classes or after a butt kicking exam is what makes College St. Q so awesome."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. The food is indeed made to order and although it can take a few minutes it definitely is worth it. The one thing I wish they did better was to have more vegetarian items on the menu. What did they do have, the polenta sandwich, is excellent.  The vegetarian pizza is also  tasty    The value is pretty good with a soup and a sandwich going for about $10."}
{"text":"Second time. Got meant +rice + veggie. $ 7.50. Delicious as usual. Huge portion. Finished 1/3 and I'm having food coma. :3The price he showed on the wall already included tax   Perfect for grab and go as the decor was pretty shaky and spaces are limited. i don't how healthy they are (my risotto was soaked in that heavenly spiced olive oil) but it tastes sooooooo good!!!!  ok, i just have to emphasize it again. it is scrumptious  !!!! definitely will come back and try other daily specials"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Right on the edge of Ut campus, it's a small joint that cooks up a different special everyday. I love the ribs and mashed potatoes!  For $10 you can get the special of the day and a drink. Super cheap and the owner doesn't skimp on food. He piles it on.   The building can be easily missed if you're not specifically looking for it. But to identify it, look for the big orange building on the left side of second cup.  Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"fine food, fine prices. the rib special and salads are the standouts of the menu - the pizza pockets and most sandwiches aren't really worth your time. the chef has always been nice to me but i've heard bad things about how he's treated some of my friends."}
{"text":"Was my go-to destination to eat well during the school year, and even while classes have been out I always hunt out the specials on their twitter to find an excuse to make the trip down. Never been disappointed with quality, food portions are always generous and the owner Judd is always pleasant.   PS: Stake out the days they do Ribfest, for 10 dollars the portion and quality of the ribs is unbeatable; smokey fall off the bone perfection!"}
{"text":"This is a real gem close to U of T campus, it's a must try for all of the students or anyone passing by!  The food is great quality, and the service is exceptional. The owner is often working and he seems like a great person who really cares about serving up great food.   This place is a good \"foodie\" spot, but without any f the snobbyness.   Whatever you get from here, you'll be full (maybe a little too full!).  The only complaint that I could possibly come up with is that they serve their burgers on classic white buns, but that's just personal preference really.   If you're brave try the hot sauces made by the owner (be careful, they really are insanely hot!).   I've tried this place quite a few times now and it is one of my go to lunch spots.  Just go!!"}
