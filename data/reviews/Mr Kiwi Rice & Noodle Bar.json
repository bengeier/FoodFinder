{"text":"Ordered fresh rolls and Singapore Vermicelli noodles with Beef.  The rolls themselves were ok the peanut sauce was not good at all.  Noodles and veggies again ok but the Beef was horrible."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say this place is authentic, BUT it is really good. If you're looking for authentic food, don't come here because you would be disappointed. I came in here looking for some good food to spice it up a little. I ordered the chicken lo mein and it was really good. It was so big I ate it for two meals. I would recommend coming here if you want a mid priced bite of Asian fusion/Chinese food. The service was good."}
{"text":"Korean operated Thai food. Everything was fine just didn't like the taste. Did not work for me and my boyfriend."}
{"text":"The deluxe pad thai was dry and bland... if ur doing uber eats for 2 people u only need one order. I called in before hand and was told it was a single serving... ok ya maybe for an animal but mannn it was more than enough & wasnt worth it at all... im sad"}
{"text":"Dining alone tonight. Stopped in here for a quick bite of culture and I was not disappointed.  Service was fast and attentive.  I asked my waitress for a suggestion and left the ordering up to her.  I find I try different dishes that way, something I might not order myself. It's a great way to explore!  After a short time beef bulgogi was brought to my table and it was fantastic!  She served it with a Vietnamese sweet coffee that was strong and sweet but not overly too much of either.  I will be coming back here next time I'm out this way."}
{"text":"I was looking for some good Asian food with a group of friends and we happened to stumble into mr.kiwi - and we were so glad we did!! First off, the service is awesome! The servers were super friendly and very attentive and we all loved the vibe inside. The beautiful interior and casual atmosphere made all of us enjoy our time there. But more importantly, the food! They have quite a variety of dishes on their menu but we were impressed at how everything tasted so great! We ordered the hargow and bbq beef short ribs to share and it was so fresh and delicious. The portions were so generous and the meat was really huge and juicy! The green curry was probably one of the best curries I've tasted and the pad Thai and veggie pho were on point. Portions are large and flavours are full. All in all we all came rolling out there happy and satisfied. I know I'm going to keep coming back to Mr Kiwi for more!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with friends. The Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai was very respectable, but the service needs improvement. Two of my friends got their food quickly. Third friend waited a couple of minutes to get his. Then the server realized that the kitchen forgot my order. Had to wait another five minutes to get my food.  Tables are small. Okay for you a few friends, but not large groups. Parking is tight."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery, took over 2 hours to come with just a simple, sorry we got busy.  Food was cold upon arrival and very bland.  Pad Thai tasteless, fried rice no flavour also.  Tons of onions, to the point that they took up half the dish, thereby the rest of the items in the dish were minimal.  Would never re-order from them or recommend."}
{"text":"Superb hot n sour soup. I had tofu/veg and it was flavorful and piping hot. Almond chicken stir fry was v. good and served hot but plate was very cold to the touch. Need to keep plates warm."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken chow mein to go, and once in my room realized they put half chicken half tofu. Rest of dish was ok at best. Would not recommend that dish at least, cannot vouch for rest of menu."}
{"text":"I ordered one of the combos at this establishment. One of the items included is a wrap made of a rice paper thing and cold vegetables and a shrimp inside. It tasted like grass. However, the General Tao was okay. Soup was good, but just on the salty end. For what I got, food seemed a little overpriced. Interior design was great, however."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch during my scoring of the EQAO at the Congress Centre. The parking seemed great at first to get one on the side but then I realized when I left it wasn't ideal due to how cramped it became. Will not do that again. When I got there at 12 I got a small table to myself sitting on a cool wooden box. A few minutes after it was insanely packed and people could not get a seat. The service is ok but can be hard to get their attention. Luckily I looked at the menu before and knew what I wanted. I thought their lunch special was dine in only but you can do take out. I got their 12 dollar special which came with a soup, spring roll, fried rice, and entr√©e. The chicken wonton soup was delicious and what I needed on this rainy day. I added hot sauce to give it a kick. The spring roll was the best I ever had. It had a nice flavor to it and I scarfed it down. The fried rice was good and nice to have an option of instead of steamed rice. I got the thai green curry chicken and it came in a giant bowl. Not as much chicken as I would like but plenty of veggies and tofu. It was flavorful and very filing. I couldn't finish all my food. It was a nice place to grab a quick lunch and I'll be back"}
{"text":"I ordered my Singapur noddles and I noticed on the pepper has a sticker! It is really disgusting and tells to much about the quality and how clean the food is. So terrible"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite to eat in Etobicoke. They have some great portion sizes and some great variety. We got 2 curries and a pho. Lots of different vegetarian and meat options. Some good flavouring, not the most delicious. Make sure you specify the spice  level some of our diishes came out super spicy even though no one asked how we wanted it. This place Does job when you're hungry. The service was quick and people were friendly"}
{"text":"I love this place and come eat here every time I am here on business. Vermicelli noodle dish is light and delicious. The shrimp variation is excellent. Great quiet ambiance and very friendly staff. If you are looking for a low key delicious Asian fusion hole in the wall, Kiwi is the place."}
{"text":"This was a nice place a few of us visited for lunch after having lunch next door just a few weeks earlier. The restaurant itself was well decorated and had a nice modern atmosphere.   The lunch menu had some great options and quite a bit of food at $15 (egg roll, dumpling, Thai salad, soup and your choice of dish - I had the Szechuan chicken). The portion sizes were good, the food was plated well and tasted delicious. There were other less expensive lunch options available as well.   Overall, it was a good experience - nothing mind blowing but I would definitely eat here again for lunch."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and I will probably give it a third go before I make my determination. Love the ambiance I just didn't like my dish. This combined with it's a touch expensive lead to the three stars. Short review because it's after the fact and I figure I'll give a more comprehensive one once I give it try number three"}
{"text":"Dumplings were cold. Still charged me half price. Maybe a decent place, but not this time."}
{"text":"Nice job!  They greet you when walk in which always nice and shows they value your patronage  The Tom Yum soup variant is delicious and includes fried tofu cubes which is a new taste experience for me and shows some thought in giving the diner a twist on fusion. It works.  Naturally you expect a dipping sauce for your crispy spring roll and it is included  The General Tao is done well with the chicken fried rice a nice option to just simple plain rice. They could be more generous with the veggies at this price point.  Parking can be tight so plan accordingly"}
{"text":"Pretty good Asian Fusian place. A lot of Korean themed food but also a mix of Thai,Chinese and Japanese. Not too big and it fills up quick. Service was a little slow the night I was there because there was only one person working the floor.  The food was excellent though."}
{"text":"This Johnny guy shares my experience in that for some reason this place has the best friggen veggies. They're just so crisp and fresh. Makes my fat ass wonder if other places managed their inventory well I'd eat more veggies right?  There must have been some improvement since they opened as food came out fast and quick. Meat in the curries were just standard chicken breast. I'd be lying if I said chicken breast was good because it's just chicken breast. I've gone to thailand with a few buddies couple years ago and this place has it pretty down. We're used to heavy curries here in north america but people in thailand eat lighter curries with MORE fresh herbs. I think Kiwi has the curry pretty well done.   The beef had good flavors but THE CALAMARI is done right. It's not like pub calamari. You got to try it because it's tender and done chinese style with the cuts to make it a flower."}
{"text":"Food was good had the pad thai with beef and Shanghai noodles also with beef.Only thing that was a issue was the service .I would definitely come back for more"}
{"text":"Usually when a place has just 4 basic(really basic) pho selections it means the broth is going to be an afterthought. I was pleasantly surprised by both the pho and the service. Even tho it was busy we still had our food fast, and the pho was spectacular. Also the first time I have ever had Szechuan Edamame! AMAZING!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences ever! Waited too long for the food to come out and every dish was a huge disappointment. Tom yum soup w tiny bay shrimp! Who does that!? And over priced at 14$ per dish. Spicy eggplant had all of 3 pieces of eggplant. Dishes generally look and taste the same-- bad. So be forewarned."}
{"text":"Outstanding. General Tao was very tasty and tender. Service was excellent as was the atmosphere. Planning on returning."}
{"text":"Very friendly and considerate service.  This little pan-Asian spot has tasty home-cooked food and is just a stone's throw from the hotel strip on the east side of Pearson.  We chose it because we were having dinner with an airline employee who had a one-night layover.  We all enjoyed the food very much.  The Thai Dumplings and Chicken Satay were really good appetizers and our noodle mains were all excellent.  Portions were extremely generous.  I wish I lived nearer to this little place.  Prices seemed quite reasonable.  Bill for four with one large beer, soft drinks, tax and tip was $107.  Parking is tight.  It's in a little strip center just east of the International Plaza and is a bit easy to miss.  If you are stranded at an airport hotel and want something other than overpriced chain food, this would be an excellent choice.  Too small for large groups."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say it's authentic,  BUT it's always good, the soups have wonderful taste, and the SPICY THAI DUMPLINGS are to die for! Freaking amazing!  Hot and sour soup isn't authentic it has broccoli in it, but still taste good,  Tum yum lacks things in it but the broth is fantastic   The pho, again isn't authentic but still has a decent taste 11.95 for a bowl but u can pay 6$ for the same size down the street and it's authentic.   Not a place of you love authentic Asian food, but for people with lesser pallets this place is good.  Price is $$$ for what its"}
{"text":"Considering we were the only people in the restaurant, I was disappointed that our food arrived at the table Luke-warm. We had PadThai and mango chicken,both would be described as average in taste. Service was friendly but I doubt if I would go back"}
{"text":"Dropped in with a group of 6 for a quick lunch since we were at a workshop nearby. The interior is pretty nice, portion sizes were decent and prices were okay. For a more casual pan Asian place I would expect the prices to be a bit lower but maybe given the location, they are what they are. Food came out pretty fast. I had the pineapple fried rice - was good portion and flavours but the pineapples seemed to be from a can, not fresh cut up pineapple."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 1 star is that the server was very nice. It is next to a sushi restaurant, which seemed fairly busy, and there is a reason I was the only one at Mr. Kiwi. I ordered dumplings as an appetizer and they needed the dipping sauce as they were very bland. The main course was a beef curry on noodles. It looked as unappetizing as it tasted. The kitchen does not take any pride in what they send out."}
{"text":"Very slow service (only 1 waitress for the whole place at prime dinner time), food was disappointing, and everything was over priced for what you get. There was too much MSG in their dishes. The little tofu pieces was just puff, without any tofu inside. Shrimp pho had 2 to 3 shrimps ($15), dishes had the same sauces, and no cilantro at all?  Waitress was nice but for a party of 7, it was a waste of time, money and appetite."}
{"text":"Wife and I love coming here after work when we don't want to cook. The food tastes well and is priced appropriately. The Korean BBQ ribs and pho are our favourite!"}
{"text":"I tried to make order for delivery. But they force me to spend 30 buck on food. Foods just for myself, how would i eat 30 buck foods that much. I dont like people been cheater."}
{"text":"This was the worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant! We sat down and waited for 15 minutes before anyone even came up to us. There was 1 guy working, and 5 tables still dirty from past people. When he finally came up to us he told us the chef was \"out shopping and probably won't be able to make us any food.\" HUGE waste of time, dirty, and overall bad experience."}
{"text":"One of the best green curry I have ever tasted!   A lot of variety and the price is very reasonable for the amount of food you get. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Perfect for weary travelers, close to airport hotels. Nice decor, fresh food. Good variety, pan-Asian. I agree with the earlier review, the little touches show the care."}
