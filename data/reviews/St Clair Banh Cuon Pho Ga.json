{"text":"The food here is really high quality and good value.  I have been hunting for a good Viet place and I think my search (at least within Toronto) is over.  It's not just the Banh Cuon - their pho bo and the Viet coffee are extremely authentic. I hate to be that guy but I'm just going to embrace it and say that this is probably the best Vietnamese food I had since I had been in Vietnam.  Decor feels very authentic too - if it was a bit more run down, dirtier and had those tiny little plastic stools and tables it would make the experience perfectly authentic!"}
{"text":"This place really grossed me out. I had ordered a fresh coconut drink but never even took a sip when it came after seeing the waitress grab the ice cubes with her bare hands and tossing them into my drink. A waitress who handles money, cleans tables and takes away dirty dishes should NOT directly touch your food and drinks with her bare hands. This is how disease spreads. I was a good sport and decided not to complain because I'm not one to complain before my food arrives, if you know what I mean. A minute into my bun cuon, I pulled out a thick black hair.  The food was mediocre. The place was comfortable because the air conditioner gave the place a nice breeze. The staff were generally pretty nice, despite the nasty surprises, which is why I'm not giving them a 1 star.  But they really need to be more hygienic."}
{"text":"Don't let appearances of this hole in a wall restaurant deceive you because if you do, you might lose the chance of trying some of the best authentic Vietnamese dishes within the city! This hidden gem serves up great food for a good price! (they don't charge tax btw!). Every time I come here, I never leave disappointed. As always, I can never pull myself away from getting their specialty 1) Duck Noodle w/ Bamboo Shoot and 2) Pork Steamed Rolls. These 2 dishes are the best and I'm sure the finest in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Another review JUST for the FOOD.   Decor and feel, definitely below average. But heck, it is true old school asian dining experience.  Like old Chinatown before many of the restaurants did renos.   It's more of dine-in, dash-out place, or pick up.    Food itself, I've had the Banh Cuon which is aweseome. This is  what the place is known for, and it delivers. Can't really describe what it is, but it's like a flat flour roll with pork and other meat and vegetables in it.  Similar to what you get at Dim Sum.   Pho, I would say is also my favorite, or up there.  It is very 'neutral' but flavourful. As someone else said, not oily or salty.  They give you this chopped peppers and garlic in a little container as your hot sauce.  Truly takes it to a whole new, unique experience.   This is also the only place when I get Pho, I do not need the Siracha or Hoisin sauce.  The chopped pepper/chili more than does the job in putting it in the soup, or putting it on the beef instead of dipping it in sauce.    Too bad it's kind of far and out of the way, but it's worth an effort to try it.  I've also scanned and put the menu up."}
{"text":"Good service!! The phos really good , I also like to get the spring roll appetizer it's really good"}
{"text":"Love their freshly made banh cuon and the steamed pork bun! A small family run Vietnamese restaurant on the west end, we are impressed with their friendly service and good quality banh cuon!"}
{"text":"Strolled into this restaurant randomly one day.  It was a lucky try between this one and three other pho places within walking distance from each other. After trying the other three, I still like this one the most! This is a Local mom and pop shop w some Awesome banh cuon! Fits about 6-7 tables. Cozy standard set up. Pho is good and average. Vietnamese coffee is okay. But definitely order their banh cuon!"}
{"text":"Must advise that the best Banh bao (steamed pork buns) in the GTA - possibly te best anywhere are sold here. I made the mistake of only buying 5. They have a deal where you can buy 10 and get 1 free. They cost $1.75 each before the deal but to be totally honest, after having tasted it, I would pay $3 apiece. The exterior (bun portion) is perfectly seasoned and light and fluffy. The filling has the precisely perfect balance of meat with caramelized onions and Omnomgoodness. There's a tiny piece of Chinese sausage (lap Cherng in Cantonese or lap suong in Vietnamese) and a quarter of a hard boiled egg. I still love their mien ga (clear noodle chicken noodle soup). When I have broth left over, I save it for my next bowl of rice. It's got msg in it but I don't mind cause it tastes so darned good going down. Their bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup) is the best I've had at a restaurant. It tastes like it's cooked with care- none of that crap where they reuse their pho broth and try to make it spicy. It's got the strong lemongrass and spiciness to the flavourful beef broth. They serve it with a heaping pile of beef shank cooked to the desired level of tenderness. I don't want them to get so busy that I have to pay for parking when I order take out but they have earned this raving review for their food."}
{"text":"I don't see it. I don't see how this place is reviewed so highly, but then again, I am not Vietnamese and have never been to Vietnam.. I only know Vietnamese food from restaurants!  I tried what was recommended -- the Pork Banh Cuon (rice rolls with ground pork), and found it disgusting. It was mealy pork, there was WAY too much rice wrapper, and it was just a nasty dish to eat. I think this might be something you either love or hate, and may or may not have grown up with it.  I tried the Spring Rolls as well, and I've come to the conclusion that Vietnamese places on St. Clair West don't know how to do a damn good spring roll. The chicken was mushy and ground up rather than being left in whole chunks, and it was just... disgusting.   The best spring rolls still remain at Khmer Thai on St. Clair West. BEST in Toronto.  I also tried the Duck Vermicelli (Bun Mang Vit), and found it all right. It wasn't anything to crow home about and although I found the noodles and broth light and tasty, I just don't see the appeal.  I'll give them another shot but I don't have high hopes."}
{"text":"Was I toronto for the weekend. Stopped here twice for the banh cuon :). Fresh and delicious just like Vietnam!"}
{"text":"One word: Shit! I waiting for like 45 min but the waiter keep ignoring me. Then finally i leave the restaurant and they didn't say sorry"}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best beef Pho I've had in Toronto.  The broth is exceptional. The flavours are fragrant and bright. Yum! They give you lots of basil and lots of meat as well.  I think I'm addicted.  They make delicious coffee. The spring rolls were nothing special, I would pass.  They're cash only, important to remember!"}
{"text":"Small place with a small menu but it's very busy inside with mostly Vietnamese customers which I thought was a good sign.  i got the banh cuon with ground pork.  It came with some herbs, bean sprouts, and nuoc cham.  The banh cuon was piping hot and with a dip into the pungently garlicky and hot nuoc cham, I was in heaven.  I devoured everything within minutes and it only cost me four dollars.  This place is an incredible gem.  I can't wait to come back and eat some more."}
{"text":"Love going here for the fresh rolls made at the store. Its a small family restaurant and food is good. Wish they open more locations."}
{"text":"This is a small little place that has some delicious Vietnamese dishes!! It is my favourite place to get banh cuon. The pho ga there is really good as well! Definitely understand why they named it pho ga banh cuon. The prices are so cheap and is a bang for your buck! Recommend."}
{"text":"Been going here for almost a decade. Its has by far the best Banh Cuon in the city and is freshly made right on the spot right after you place your order. Their banh bao is also very good, the doigh is very light and fluffy, while the filling is flavorful."}
{"text":"This was the first time trying chicken pho and obviously had to try it since it's their specialty. I was blown away by the delicious flavourful broth. I am always on the hunt for great pho restaurants and I will say this is my new fave! I also ordered the banh cuon which was pretty good but would come back mostly for their chicken pho."}
{"text":"Nice vietnamese restaurant with a nice variety of viet food on the menu.  I got bun oc and it tastes like when I had it as a kid. Dive type restos are the best places so dont expect anything fancy with the look of this place. But I'm here to eat so it's all good!"}
{"text":"The place is very small and dated also on the dirty side. They specialized in Banh cuon,  banh cuon is also a vietnamese breakfast. It's steam rice flour roll with mince pork filling in the center. All of their soup base food isn't worth mentioning. There isn't much viet restaurant doing fresh banh cuon like this. Making banh cuon is more time consuming then pho and com. A lot of vietnamese people frequent this place. However just because vietnamese eat here doesn't mean it's good. This place is located in North york and there is a large vietnamese community living there. There are also 4 or 5 other vietnamese restaurant on the same block. They are not consistent with the banh cuon, sometimes the rice roll are way too thick and with very little fillings. With this type of food it has to be as thin as possible, almost translucent like. Like I said very hard to make, can't blame them. In the last 10 or so years their price has only increase like 50 cents so it's very affordable. I believe its $5 for banh cuon and $6.50 for one size pho. Now do you get why so many vietnamese  eat here?lol. They also sometimes microwave the banh cuon so watch out for that. Overall very good price and food is so so."}
{"text":"At the moment this place holds the best bowl of Bun Rieu that a restaurant in the GTA (that I've tried) can offer. Everything that was \"missing\" was filled here! Their banh cuon is top notch as well.   Came here early in the afternoon and it was dead except for one table who were about to pay and leave. Didn't really mean much to me that the restaurant was empty because I came solely based on referral. Ordered 3x bowls of bun rieu 1x banh cuon.    You can tell that the bun rieu wasn't re-cooked from the day before or something because all the ingredients were fresh, it's a little on the sweeter side but most restaurants tend to not be able to hit the fish sauce-y aroma that bun rieu has. I don't get it homemade anymore so this is probably my next closest thing. Although it's in the sweeter side, this one key element in my opinion makes the cut for BEST bun rieu in Toronto (that I tried so far)   The banh cuon was also steaming (lol) hot when it came out and wow the mix they use for the rice roll was the perfect consistency not too think and it wasn't too thin where it broke apart either. The filling was good but all and all banh cuon is pretty standard across the board.   The service was great, it's obviously a family oriented restaurant by how relaxed and casual the workers are, giving it a more home-y vibe :)? The place looks like a hole in the wall that hasn't been patched since 1987 but that doesn't affect the quality of the food!!   Will repeat till they for whatever reason close up shop and then I'll get the recipe from them LOL"}
{"text":"This restaurant never disappoint.  Came back again today with my mom and baby for late lunch.  While the inside decor is pretty much dated more ancient than me but don't let the atmosphere fool you.  The food is still amazing after all this time.   My mom ordered the duck with bamboo shoot in rice noodle soup and it was quite good according to her, one of the better ones she's had in the GTA.  I tried their bun rieu for the first time and mind you I am the queen connoisseur of Bun Rieu and this was the best tasting one I've ever had in my life in the GTA.  I have to admit while I was pleasantly impressed but rather not surprised at all.  You walk into this place and the horrible decor, old furniture, faded wall art and hand written menu items on the wall, you would be smart to realize that a restaurant that still thrives with repeating customers and is still doing excellent has only one reason; amazing tasting food."}
{"text":"Recently came back here and I was reminded just how good this place is!! Their pho (although there were times it was a bit too oily), stuffed sausage rice wrap and Vietnamese ice coffee with condense milk were all on point. Really, really delicious."}
{"text":"I have had so many bad experiences with Vietnamese food in the city. (i.e. places that don't offer basil, their fish sauce vignegrette is just fish sauce, broths that taste like soap and make you run for a glass of water).  This place takes the prize for being the most authentic by far. The Vietnamese food is awesome if you go on a Saturday and Sunday morning, the Banh Cuon is fresh and you can tell it just came off the pan.  I love Banh Cuon but will almost never order it in Toronto, except when I go here.  Even when it is pre made (9pm on a sunday night right before they close), it is still better than most Viet joints in Scarborough/Toronto.  My go to dish aside from Banh Cuon is the Duck&Bamboo soup. The decor underwhelming to say the least and I've never had to use their washroom."}
{"text":"I don't understand why restaurants specializing in banh cuon choose to reheat dishes that have already been made!  What's up with this disease that's running rampant at banh cuon restaurants all over town?  I don't get it.  Anyway, here's the lowdown:  1. This place reminds me of Vietnam.  It's very nostalgic in that sense (dirty, missing washroom, grimy, amazing).  2. Pho was a solid 3.5 stars.  Only one size, slightly oily and cloudy broth, but tasty.  Tendon is nice.  $6.  3. Banh cuon was meh.  You could tell it was heated in a microwave as the sweet sweet innards were piping hot.  Plus it came out in about 2 minutes.  Still though, it was like $4.50...not too bad of a risk, but not worthy of the \"Banh Cuon\" in the restaurant's name.  4. Location...not so good if you don't live in the area.  Not really a destination place with so many other (better options) closer to the core.  5. Huge +1 -- super cheap and no tax.  A pho, banh cuon, and duck noodle soup came to $18.  You can't beat that.  Overall, it's acceptable but not worth the trek out that way."}
{"text":"Was in the area visiting home depot just 10 minutes away from my work. After getting pulled over by the cops for an expired plate validation it was time to EAT!   My Dad recommended this place for their specialty, Banh Cuon, a rice flour roll topped with different meat choices or stuffed with minced meat and loaded with mint leaves, bean sprouts and lots of chili and fish sauce :)  Drool!!!   The owner/front of house was funny and joked with us when my bf changed his order more than once.   We ended up with an off the menu order of all the toppings on the rice flour rolls and a special pho with everything.   Pho... I'm picky for the broth flavor, amount of meat to noodle ratio and types of meat. The tripe...which I barely ever eat was so tender I ate them all first. The tendons were a good solid piece with great flavor.  The Bahn Cuon... soft... airy and fresh! The fried shrimp cake was a bit doughy for me and tiny shrimp but everything else was soooo good.   Will definitely me back :)"}
{"text":"I always come here for the bun mang vit (duck noodle soup with bamboo), and so far it's the best in the city. I've tried the same dish in countless other places in Toronto but they've all paled compared to Banh Cuon St. Clair. I don't ever finish an entire bowl of noodle soup, including the broth, anywhere I go, but if it's here, it's guaranteed I will slurp up the entire thing until there is nothing left.   If I'm feeling famished, then I usually get a large banh cuon order (with the shrimp cake - a must!!) to share and that usually puts me and my boyfriend thoroughly satisfied. The banh cuon is good as long as it's fresh. I've noticed that sometimes they make extra and keep it on hand and serve that. Try to always get it fresh if you can, I've never requested it (since I always get the bun mang vit) but it doesn't hurt to ask.  The decor is very run down and dated but the food and price is right so I can't complain :P"}
{"text":"This place has the best f***ing banh cuon in Toronto. Hands down. I have not ordered anything else from Banh Cuon St Clair and nor will I ever.   I am not necessarily a fan of eating in, generally we call for pick up for banh uot (by itself) and take it home and assemble everything ourselves.   I find the banh cuon (with filling) is expensive for the amount you receive, but if you like banh cuon, then it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"All Vietnamese restaurants serve pho of course, but not many also do bánh cuon (Vietnamese steamed rice rolls). My sister complains that the bánh cuon served around little East Chinatown are disappointing shit. In the search for a local restaurant that can live up to what we were used to at home, the mechanical fairies of Yelp suggested this place as one with promising potential. After all, it's in its business name.  Among the small Viet enclave along St. Clair, Banh Cuon Pho Ga is one of a handful of restaurants packed with old neighbourhood faces hanging out for a weekend meal and chat here. So typically dingy, unassuming and basic hole-in-the-wall-looking for a typical Viet diner (like so many others on the block), and empty tables seemed to have missed the attention of a complete post-meal wipedown. It seems also that you get more service attention the closer you sit to the open kitchen, because I had to haul my own ass to hand over our order sheet or to pay. They do get a lot of takeout orders though.   But in terms of food, they keep it simple--a short menu compared to most other Vietnamese places that give you a gazillion ways of serving pho. And damn cheap too. All pho $6, and them banh cuon start at $4--four!--for the most basic kind with ground pork.  The rolls come in sets of four, which is enough to be filling or be like a large appetizer. It's decent but I find the skin to be rather thick and bland. The shrimp cupcake though were delicious--a good mix of soft and crispy.  Can't speak about anything else they make here. Though for me to haul ass this far for pho is a big stretch. Keep this place in mind should one ever be this far in St. Clair West. And yes, cash only.  {TTC: 512 to the Silverthorn/Hounslow Heath stop. I guess you could also get here using the West Toronto Railpath all the way and keep going all the way on Osler St until you are facing it on approach.}"}
{"text":"I have lived here for a long time and always went to the other restaurants to get Pho and other Viet food. I'm glad I made the decision to try the Banh Cuon here. It was excellent - first of all. It was cheap and tasty. It is definitely a 'traditional' place and run by a small family.   Really, there is not much to do here but enjoy the food. The noodles and other Viet options were good. They had some English menues and they explained things to non-Viet people. Tea was good.   Don't come here for the décor."}
{"text":"There is another Pho restaurant couple doors away but it seemed like a Canadianized restaurant. So I walked in here obviously. Probably a great decision I made. Very satisfied with everything. Quiet unlike others, no distractions. Just the food and people around me. My tongue did not feel any remaining nastiness after eating couple dishes. Which means it's clean and not full of BS sauce.  YESS"}
{"text":"The Banh Cuon is mediocre. I find that they use a little too much rice noodle in ratio to the pork -though I love the shrimp cupcake that comes with it! Ive been coming to this place as a cheap eat all year. It's quick, fast and close to home. The service is not great, well they're asian.. So I don't expect much. (Lol. Its okay. I'm asian. I'm allowed to make these assumptions.)They also don't care much about presentation nor the ambiance of their restaurant either. My germaphobia really kicks in when I look at their utensils... But hey don't let their run down appearance fool you, their Banh Cuon is always freshly made. Haha :)p  Recently I tried the duck and bamboo noodle soup... My. God. Why have I been eating the Banh Cuon all this time?? LOVE the soup!! Omg I'm about to head there for the 3rd night in a row....   Also, the ginger sauce that comes with the duck is perfect!!   I'm going to clean up this pile of drool and head out!"}
{"text":"As authentic and delicious as they come. Cash only and very simple and savory.   Needed to find a pho place for a quick lunch in between meetings and did a search. There's two right next to each other a newer flashier one that does viet Thai cuisine, and this place.   The yelp reviews (hehe) seemed positive so I parked and walked in. Right away saw the kind of dated and antique dining area with textbook family owned and operated feel and Vietnamese everywhere. Ordered the large house special, which was #7, and it was only $7.50!  Very fresh tasting with lots of meat and noodles. Lots of spices and fresh herbs. Under $9 total. Left a $10. Cash only but worth it if you're walking by or need something to warm up and fill your stomach.   Would come back for a quick lunch again."}
{"text":"Only place I know that serves delicious banh cuon in the city. I get the one with the ground pork and sausages and it's on point. Cheap too. A little dingy in terms of the room."}
{"text":"Excellent pho pho-sure! Will not pho-get the flavours and fragrance of basil pho weeks! Small family operation with minimal decor. Tables for 4. My well done beef pho was very tasty with delicate noodles. Green P parking nearby and a n street. Prices are low to."}
{"text":"Had the duck soup and banh cuon with ground meat. Good banh cuon. Very thin and ample filling. The broth in the soup was good. Clean taste which you get from thorough washing of the broth which means it done traditionally and with effort. Duck itself was OK. The place was a little dingy but it's common in Viet restaurants."}
{"text":"What a gem near stockyards!  Would definitely be back. Tried the beef soup pho / as others mentioned the broth is flavourful and on the sweet side. Came here for lunch on a random Monday and had quite a number of Vietnamese customer."}
{"text":"One of the few Viet restos that specializes in Chicken Pho. Clean, savoury and available in white meat only. Definitely caters to my Pho preferences.  The rice rolls alone are worth coming here for. You have to like soft/sticky textures to appreciate it, so only try if you aren't expecting a traditional fried spring roll."}
{"text":"After working out at a local gym, I was craving for a authentic hot and spicy bowl of Bun Bo Hue.  My favorite Bun Bo Hue in Toronto is 13 km away from the gym and I didn't want to drive too far. Therefore, I decided to give this restaurant a try.  The restaurant seems to be established long time ago.  They don't have updated menu.  It is operated by an older couple and two younger children who are all very polite and down to earth.  They have no idea that Yelp exists, so I introduced them to this site and read reviews about them. They were like \"ohhh and ahhh\" which was really cute.  I didn't try their most popular dishes which are Bun Rieu and Banh Cuon with Cha Lua.  However, the Cha Lua in my Bun Bo Hue was delicious. I will buy the Cha Lua from them again next time.  I ordered Pho and Bun Bo Hue.  My teenagers children liked their Pho.  They like the both, but wish the rare meat is better.  I like the Bun Bo Hue, but I only give it 4 stars because it is good, but not exceptional as the Bun Bo Hue on Finch, which I considered one of the best Bun Bo Hue I have ever eaten (giving that I lived near Little Saigon, California for 30 years).  Next time, I will try their famous Bun Rieu, Banh Cuon, and adventure to Bun Mam and will update this review.  In the meantime, happy yelping!"}
{"text":"My husband and I order our pho here often as we live in the neighbourhood.  The gentleman who owns the restaurant is very kind and the pho is totally flavorful, fresh and the portion is generous.  There are a couple of othe pho restaurants on this strip of St. Clair Ave. W but this little charmer is the only one we are loyal to.  Their pho is consistently well prepared and not expensive.  The broth is deep and not too oily or salty, with all the accompaniments.  We have yet to go deeper into the menu but will likely soon!"}
{"text":"Ermaagodddddd, the best banh cuon in Toronto (or anywhere other than Vietnam) you will find in store (obviously if u made them at home they will prob taste way awesome-er but who has that kind of time and patience??) they are freshly made, rolled, etc in stores. You can also buy them by weight (pounds) to bring home :) just make sure if u do buy by weight, don't forget to either ask or purchase their vegetables and cha lua that ur supposed to eat with it. Also their shrimp cupcakes (banh cong) is freaking delicious, also made fresh in store. They also have banh baos (fresh as well!!) in the morning, usually sold out by lunch so whenever we go, we always buy the whole tray lols. U can keep them in ur fridge for about a week and they are still tasty. They also serve their banh cuon with meat or banh uot without the meat and just the rolls(incase u don't like meat). Now onto their other meals... their bun mang vit is delicious. I took my boyfriend here one time and he's never stopped talking about it ever since. He lives in montreal so whenever he pops into Toronto, he has to come here at least once to have their banh cuon and bun mang vit. They also have the best Vietnamese iced coffee, so rich in flavour and made to order unlike other pho stores out there who make a bunch and leaves it in the fridge. Ok so to summarize all the things I've said, everything is basically made fresh, and everything is yummy. Only downside is you have to pay for parking, but I don't think they deserve to lose 1 star for that so it's still 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Literally the best pho ga we've ever had. And ever single time we go back it's like we experience the depth of flavours in that broth for the first time again! They do everything in house from the rice rolls to the buns. And the best thing is it's so inexpensive. If I lived closer I'd being going every week for sure. Also I didn't write this review for ages in fears of it getting overly crowded from being popular but I think it's about time we share our little secret!"}
{"text":"This place is totally legit. I was here last week on a friend's recommendation for the super duper fresh banh cuon and totally worth the drive. The open kitchen lets you see them making the rice wrapper fresh before your very eyes. I also had a bowl of pho which was very good as well.   Next time I'm back I will be ordering from the specials listed on the pieces of paper on the wall - some awesome dishes not listed in the menu. Will def be back next time I'm in Corso Italia."}
{"text":"Updated review: 2 years later, it's just as good as before. Very authentic and the price is right. If you've enjoyed these dishes in Vietnam, you'll enjoy it here."}
{"text":"Went here looking for new viet dishes to try and it sounded promising based on Tina N's review.  Menu was limited (which is nice, easy to make a selection unlike some other viet places with 500 menu options). I tried the Duck Noodle w/ Bamboo Shoot  (number 101) which did not disappoint! It had lots of duck meat, thick noodles and the broth was tasty. Also sampled some of the steamed rolls which were also very good.  The place is dingy (-1 star). Our table felt grubby on the surface and there was a cigarette butt on the floor underneath my chair.   Also, they don't seem to have washrooms, not that I would have especially wanted to use a washroom there.   Service was good, just one guy there doing all the cooking and serving, but the place was empty so it didn't slow him down."}
{"text":"We ordered for take out. The 4 star is for the duck salad, goi vit, and their Bánh Công. Banh cuon is good but banh uot is just ok, so plain. Also they don't give enough veggies with banh cuon, only sprouts. They didn't warn me they ran out of banh Công but charged me the same for the dish. Will give them once more chance and see ..."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday at lunch time. It was recommended by my hairdresser.  I went with an open mind since the reviews are great but my hairdresser is Vietnamese and she's very picky when it comes to Vietnamese food. She said of the 3 Vietnamese Restaurants on the same street side by side this place would be the best of the 3 but not amazing.  So I decided to try it and form my own opinion.  I of course had what they specialize in which is Banh Cuon. It's in the name of their restaurant!  Banh Cuon is essentially steamed rice rolls either plain or there's an option to have ground pork and fungus in it. My daughters got the plain ones I got the ground pork and fungus with a side order of shrimp cakes. Also for the appetizer we got the shrimp rolls. We were so hungry we scarfed down the shrimp rolls before I can take a pic.. The shrimp rolls was good and pretty authentic. The Banh Cuon was so cheap!! $4 for the plain ones with Vietnamese sausage. Mine was $7 with the Vietnamese ham and shrimp cake.  It tasted great and great price too. I saw recommendations for the duck noodle soup. So I'll try that next time."}
{"text":"Over the past few months I've returned and tried out the Bun Rieu (meat/crab vermicelli soup), more Pho and purchased their Cha (Vietnamese ham).  I have to say I absolutely love this place--I'm a way it is your Vietnamese 'mom and pop diner' where everything is made in-house!  The Bun Rieu option is located on a piece of paper on the wall, \"specials\" if you will.  The service is always courteous and nice.  I done here solo more often than with company and they are very respectful of that.  Honestly you can get a small simple meal for $5.00 which is wonderful!"}
{"text":"It has banh cuon in its name, so their banh cuon should be good. It is not a fancy restaurant, but they have good food for good prices.  The price of the Banh Cuon dishes jump from $4, $6, and $6.50 with no tax to boot. I usually get the first one, the $4 one (i forget the name but has pork in it), or you can get a variation of it with fried bread with a shrimp in it.  There is a residential street just around the corner, so you can park for free while you sit in for your scrumptious meal."}
{"text":"I've been taste testing bun rieu at diff Viet restaurants across the city, and I was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful it was here. Def. try it if it's available on their off-menu special board!"}
{"text":"There's so much to love about this place. First off, the handmade ricerolls and buns(that you buy from the counter) are so fresh and delicious.. It is very authentic and homey tasting. Also love how they actually have a whole quail eggs in the bun instead of normal chicken eggs some places use. The kitchen is open-view so you can watch them make stuff while you eat. They give a side dish of crushed garlic and hot peppers to put in your pho instead of giving you whole peppers. It's really spicy and gives pho a different colour of flavour. Which brings us to the pho. I have tried w my gf the duck noodles and regular pho with assorted meats. The pho unfortunately comes in once size (medium). The broth is not the richest in terms of flavour but it tastes homey. The duck noodles are great, a lot of meat and the broth has a good herbal and duck flavour. The coffee was a bit too sweet but strong and good. If the pho came in L or XLs here I might have given this place a 5/5 stars xD. Overall a diamond in the rough for sure."}
