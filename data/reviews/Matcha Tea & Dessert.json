{"text":"What a nice place that I found in downtown, I like there cakes, so cuuuuuute.... and taste very delicious, every time I walk pass, I can't control myself to enter there, the stuff works there all beautiful and nice, let me feel sunshine when the sky grey, it's a good place to have a break time with friends..."}
{"text":"The price is not high, the taste is very goodI Love Matcha?The point is that the shop assistants are nice people"}
{"text":"The matcha soft serve has a wonderful matcha taste. Definitely a real stuff. Nonetheless, the soft serve is a bit on the slushy side. If it is a bit firmer, I would for sure give a 5 star!"}
{"text":"To start, I have to say that I do like their matcha soft serve.  It has a good balance of the matcha flavour and the sweetness.  You know \"too matcha\" can have a bitter or fishy taste.  But this place make it right.  You can still taste the matcha but with the right amount of sweetness.  Also ordered the hot red bean latte.  And I loooove it!  I am glad that there is now another hot drink that I like!
Also should I mention that before they serve the soft serve or drink (probably first batch of the day) they would actually taste it first before serving.  I like that professionalism."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm so impressed by the red bean ice cream. It tasted very good and creamy. I think they do this with the real red bean, you can see the mashed beans inside. This red bean one was quite similar to what I had in Taiwan before. Matcha ice cream also good too, it tasted so \"matcha\". Next time I will still go for the twist.
Servers were really friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Today was the last day for free soft serve ice-cream with the post of a review on yelp. Hold on though, do NOT skip this review. 

The person who served me the ice-cream seemed nice. He seemed genuine about his business (I think he was the owner?). He wanted me to taste it before I blindly posted a picture and left a random comment. He wanted an actual review and what I thought about the ice-cream. I give him my brownies points for that :) 

I tried the twist (half red bean and half matcha). The matcha is more bitter than other matcha desserts and ice-cream i've had. You can really taste the matcha/tea! It's not subtle at all compared to other places. I like that you can taste the flavour. The red bean wasn't exactly my style, I think i'll depend on my mood--it's not bad though, just not my cup of tea. However, if you find the matcha to be too strong, I recommend you get the twist as the red bean adds sweetness to it. Overall, pleased with the experience. The place is small, so it definitely isn't a studying place. But, you can probably get your quick fix of matcha here :)"}
{"text":"Disappointed by Matcha Tea & Desserts after seeing it all over IG. I ordered three things: Matcha Cream Cheese Foam, ujicha and the Hokkaido Lava Cake. 

Matcha Cream Cheese Foam - similar to another reviewer's comment below, the matcha drink itself was watery, sugary, and lacked in any matcha flavor. The foam didn't have any cheese or cream cheese flavour; it tasted predominantly like whipped evaporated milk. It's not a bad taste, but not what it purports itself to be. 

The ujicha was lacking in any real tea flavour. Just sugary water. But surprisingly large amount (like a Starbucks venti size), so one star there.

The Hokkaido Lava cake was the biggest disappointment of them all. I was surprised the cake was cold, because you generally need \"lava\" to be warm to flow. Guess what. The lava didn't flow and worse, it was bland. The cake was very eggy, tasting more like an omelette in flavour than well, cake. This was the one thing I looked forward to the most and was just let down. 

$17 for all of that was a waste of money. But at least the seats were comfy and there was free wifi. Second star. I was so annoyed by the food and drinks here I hopped in an Uber to Tsujiri to make up for my experience. 

Getting IG \"influencers\" to share your food means nothing if you can't deliver. In fact, the disappointment is even greater. If you have \"matcha\" in your name, I expect the matcha to be good."}
{"text":"80% of their menu is unavailable. I got matcha in a cup and their portions are extremely small for a $6 leaning swirl. My friend got their matcha drink and it tasted like water.

Very disappointed. Incomparable to Tsujiri and Tendou."}
{"text":"The matcha here was delicious! It was not too bitter nor too sweet and when mixed with the red bean....this soft serve duo was the perfect combo!"}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday around 8. It was pretty quiet as we were the only ones there. The cashier was friendly and offered us a sample of the twist (matcha + red bean). The matcha was a nice 'strong' green tea colour and the flavour reflected the same, not very sweet at all. The red bean was much sweeter in contrast, although I didn't find the flavour very strong. Not sure if trying the matcha first kind of affected my taste buds. I ended up getting a matcha mini, which was a good amount considering the price.  The biggest disappointment was the texture of the soft serve. I've had other matcha soft serve where the texture was smooth and creamy like ice cream or gelato. This matcha soft serve had a very icy texture to it which I did not enjoy.  The red bean soft serve was slightly better, but you could still feel the icy texture.  I probably won't go out of my way to come back as there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"I had the red bean soft serve and thought it was pretty typical? Not that I expected anything super WOW, but it was pretty standard soft serve. They had gold plated ice cream which looks really interesting but is also expensive AF. Also note that the store takes cash only or wechat/Alipay."}
{"text":"Cute little shop for ice cream! I liked the flavor because it's not overly sweet. I can't stand desserts where all I taste is sugar.

The matcha is a bit bitter and the red bean was sweet. It's good to have them together in the twist. You can ask for samples! It's a pretty good size sample too.

I actually like their green tea over tsujiri and its much cheaper. I shared the regular size with my bf and it was definitely enough. For the price, it's a splurge item so I won't have it often but if it's hot out... I'll be here!

I see lots of photos better than mine so I won't add mine to the gallery lol!"}
{"text":"Small store with a small menu. Matcha was flavourful and very generous with their matcha. Couple chairs, more of a takeout place. Only has latte and ice cream here.

Matcha ice cream cone - $5.50 (RECOMMEND). 

Ps. Makes no sense, the twist is $6 when just the regular red bean is $4.50? Why would you pay more just to have less since matcha ($5.50) costs more than red bean? Just come in, ask for red bean sample and get the matcha one."}
{"text":"The ice cream has a very rich flavour of matcha and dairy. The ice cream is very cold and I seems to taste the matcha tea leaves in the ice cream. The texture of the ice cream seems to be in the middle of the soft and hard ice cream.

It is good and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Newly opened 3 weeks ago. A small place with only 4 seats luckily we were the only customers tonight. They were nice enough to let us stay and chat for an hour.  The red bean and matcha combination is nice. They have free tasting if you are curious. I love matcha! Wish they had other type of desserts too but looks like only ice cream for now. 
Free wifi available too."}
{"text":"Location/Service
Inside Commerce Gate Plaza. The store is a little hidden as the entrance is inside the plaza, but you can't miss it with the big green Matcha sign. Parking is available within the plaza (and there's underground parking too)

Decor is similar to their downtown location, a very nice wallpaper of Taiwan/Japan/HK landscape. Not much seating available, so it's more a quick grab and go situation. 

Staff are friendly and helpful with any questions you have. There are samples available if you are curious to know what the icecream tastes like. 

Food
Menu items are similar to the downtown location, but fewer options due to a smaller kitchen size. The go to item is their Matcha and Red Bean icecream, which you can go individual or a twist. Both very strong in their flavors, which fits to my personal taste and they compliment well as a twist. It is a little pricey compare to other places, but it is a higher quality of matcha. 

I also tried their matcha latte. Again, smooth to taste and not overly sweet. The cup however does get very very hot, so be careful. 

I think they will slowly expand their menu items with snacks available, so whenever you have a craving, be sure to swing by!"}
{"text":"Before Matcha opened, I was eating around the block and excited for its grand opening because like it's name, it should be all about the matcha crave - something I love.

Just recently, I got to finally drop in for a taste. Noticeably, half the menu was not ready and available, only the drinks and maybe two cakes. I can understand why other reviewers gave a poor rating due to that, but I rather think it's poor management of customer experience. They set customers' expectation bar higher by putting things they can't sell on the menu, whereas Matcha should've left it all out rather than now.

Nevertheless, I still wanted to try their items for myself. My boyfriend and I ordered the Ujicha (hot) and Matcha Cheese Foam, both recommended drinks.

Matcha Cheese Foam had a good taste of matcha and that slight texture of powder when it's more authentic in its ingredients. However, I can tell the overall flavour still tasted watered down. There wasn't any cheese aroma until I got to the bottom. It tasted more like cheesecake than cheese.

Similar feedback on the Ujicha. It got the matcha flavour but it a sense, it seems weak and watered down. Overall taste is like the hot version of Matcha Cheese Foam.

For the quality and price paid on the drinks, I think it's pricy and can get better variety and matcha flavour in other dessert stores.

Customer service was decent. An employee did try to recommend a cake and they also passed out a new cake that's planning to be sold.

Matcha store decor was simply their seats at the back consist of small square tables on one side like Tsujiri and longer rectangular tables like Chatime. Down side about the small tables is that it lacks leg and feet room between two people. Other than that, atmosphere and music was nice.

P.S. Staff are mandarin speaking."}
{"text":"Rating - 3.0/5.0

To fulfill my curiosity, I decided to try out the soft serve here after seeing some mixed reviews from some folks.

I originally tried their soft serve more than a year ago at an event downtown so I wanted to see if anything had changed. 

A few key points about my latest experience: The soft serve texture was significantly icier and does not have the same depth of matcha flavour as Tendou Matcha. I can taste more of the red bean than the matcha. The matcha is more sweet so it works for those who aren't too fond of the deep matcha flavour. 

The twist formation also left a fairly large hole in the center so it was hollow in the middle. The soft serve also started to drip quite quickly. In terms of pricing, it is a bit more expensive than Tendou Matcha for the mini cone.

Overall it is still alright for the casual soft serve eater but not so much for those who look for a more elevated taste. I am sure this place will still do well given there is high traffic in the plaza and the only store with such offering."}
{"text":"Hours of operation says 4pm to 12 midnight as per their sign. We went in on a normal non-holiday friday at 1145pm but was unfortunetly already closed. Took a photo of this at 1154 pm (forgot phone in car and had to run and get it).  Little diappointed.

We came back the next day at 10pm and was happy to see they were open. Got the matcha ice cream, however another hiccup... the machine was not working that day.  The male worker tried to work it for a good 10min and kept assuring us that the ice cream will come. It didn't. We tried to get a refund but he said that he was not able to contact the manager to work the refund options on the till.  Instead he told us that he will try the machine again... Optimistically I replied okay. Waited another 5 min... another dud.. machine was not working again ( surprise surprise). He finally said \"okay I will call manager\". (Wow..  he lied before saying he wasn't able to call the manager) 

After a long struggle, we finally got the refund back.  Two days later (we must be persistent matcha lovers) we went back a third attempt.  This time managed to get the matcha ice cream. It was pretty good.  Unfortunately, thinking about the past experience and troubles with this establishment didn't really leave a satisfying taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Two of us came here one evening around 9pm on a weekday. We wanted to try the matcha soft serve in a cone. When we arrived there, there was one person working at the counter. She said she could make enough for one cone if we wanted to order the regular size Matcha soft serve. So we said sure, we'd share it! There was no other soft serve flavour option available at that time.

When we got the cone, it was perhaps 3/4 filled with soft serve and so disappointing, especially because I think it was greater that $6 - close the $7 maybe if not more? We asked if she could top it up a little more and she offered to give us a mini cone instead, which was nice, but still very small. Maybe it was the time we went, but we felt like if there wasn't enough matcha soft serve left, we should have been told honestly. (Also, I thought there would still be soft serve left at 9pm on a weekday, since they close at midnight) I don't think I'll be coming here again. If you're looking for matcha soft serve, visit Tsujiri nearby Yonge and Sheppard."}
{"text":"The overall decor is nice and clean, and the washroom is also equally clean, which is a good sign. There's a bench up front for those waiting for drinks to go, and more seats in the back for pairs or foursomes depending on your preferences when it comes to group outings.

In terms of service, there isn't much of a system. We had a group of 10 come in and placing orders one by one. Receipts were handed out, but there were no numbers. When the drinks were ready, they didn't call them out and just left them on the counter. We even ended up with an extra drink because, presumably, they had prepared it for someone else but thought it was for us anyways. There's one person working the cash and one person making the drinks, so if a lot of people suddenly come it falls apart.

They have some drink specials for $3, but they don't really look that appealing. After receiving feedback from others who decided to order it, I went with their matcha mousse.

It comes with a layer of cheese (?) on top, with the matcha drink underneath.
The flavour of the matcha was quite strong, so if you like that bitter matcha flavour this is not bad. I didn't like that layer of white stuff on top though. I've tried similar teas at other places and didn't like having that layer of stuff on top.

There are also food and desserts available, but I only got a drink.
At least with food, they will bring it to you."}
{"text":"Their matcha soft serve ice cream was excellent -very strong matcha flavours with a hint of sweetness. I will be back to try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Came across this place while making a run to The Alley. They have red bean and matcha ice cream. Got a sample of the red bean to taste and I didn't really like it. But that's because I'm not a fan of red bean. If you like redbean then you might like it or possibly fall in love with it... It's sweet and full of flavour. So we ended up ordering the matcha one.
The matcha soft serve has its texture, it's creamy and it has the matcha green tea taste, but I wasn't a fan of the gritty pieces of matcha with the ice cream. It's almost like they didn't mix the ingredients in well enough. 
I dont remember the price, but I think it's a little more expensive than Tendous price. 
If I were to compare it with Tendou, I prefer Tendous matcha softserve over this place."}
{"text":"The charcoal icecream was quite hyped all over social media. As someone who loves ice cream and the unique look of it it definitely made me want to try.

The store is quite small and not much sitting space as expected of many ice cream establishments. The ice cream I got was the charcoal ice cream ordered with a charcoal cone. The ice cream itself had no flavor nor did the cone. It was a let down because I thought there would be some taste but what I got was just coldness. The ice cream is very photogenic  but in terms of taste it lacks. Its not the cheapest ice cream and for me it truly is a one time thing."}
{"text":"Great friendly service! Took the time to explain the flavours and what mix options are available. Their daily special was the marshmallow pink soft serve! Green tea flavour was not the best ive had, there were some bits in there which i think is the matcha powder. London fog was good - not too sweet and refreshing. My girlfriend had the charcoal and marshmallow and she enjoyed it! The color combo is so esthetic. Def worth trying (: they even gave us the special shovel spoon because he saw us taking photos!"}
{"text":"Passed by this place around 3pm and saw this place but it's empty... I thought instead of waiting a long line up at Alley, let's give this place a try...

Studied the menu, they have variety of matcha ice cream/drinks and other tea item. And I guess since the name of this shop is matcha, I would guess its focus is matcha ... but then also see they offer charcoal flavour soft ice cream which sounds interesting but I only have tummy for one ice cream... what a decision I have to make... lol. I decided to ditch the matcha and try the charcoal because I never had one before. Maybe there are other place offer charcoal flavour, please let me know. Anyway, the ice cream looks really black, sure looks like there are charcoal in it but I really don't know how charcoal should taste like. Maybe I should buy a bag of BBQ charcoal in Canadian tire and take a byte and compare.. :)

Well, it just taste like regular ice cream, no special taste or aroma. If charcoal is good for you in some way, I guess why not. Sure it's fun eating it. It looks pretty cool, pure black with a shine. And you should share this with your female other half and make her smile after taking a few byte of the ice cream.. haha! I would recommend, which I did also, ordered a hot tea just so after the ice cream, you have something to rinse your teeth with to get rid of the charcoal from the teeth.

I ordered the white peach oolong tea, nothing particularly special, a normal cup of tea..

So, without trying the matcha item here, my rating is probably slightly above 3 stars given the price is not cheap either. Total comes to $11 bucks for ice cream and tea. But it's a cool little place, and the service is friendly and quite accommodating , give it a try!"}
{"text":"Walking by this place, looked at the menu and decided to give it a try. Ordered the A1 house special ramen and A3 curry ramen. $8.99 each. I like the house special ramen. Not crazy about the curry one hubby ordered. Added the daily special drink $2.99 for 16oz. Not bad. Overall, the food is not extraordinary, not bad either. Drink is good for its price. If I am rating the drink only, I will give it a 4 star."}
{"text":"This store has a nice array of soft serves. It includes matcha, charcoal, sesame, Earl Grey, red bean, and oolong.  Their twist varieties include matcha with charcoal and Earl Grey with oolong the day I visited. I chose matcha with charcoal. 

TL;DR conclusion:

Pros:
* Lots of flavours for soft serve that aren't common
* Workers speak fluent English
* Limited seating is available 
* The regular cone is beautifully shaped
* Clean 
* SPC discounts apply
* Prices are reasonable 
* You can get gold or silver sheets on your soft serve

Cons:
* The soft serve is not as dense and rich (feels thin and the flavour seems a little watered down)
* Can't use credit cards here 
* Need to drive to this location 

I'll probably come back to try the red bean soft serve if a friend wanted to go. However, because the ice cream itself lacks flavour, I will not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"2.5-3 stars

Once again, I was persuaded by the IG foodies and I had to come here after my dinner at Jackpot Chicken.

We were there around 7PM and it was dead with only one customer. I had a question about what Ujicha was, and I asked one employee there and he didn't seem to understand me so he had another employee answer my question. Anyways, I ordered the Matcha Cheese Foam Latte and my cousin had the cold Ujicha. To be honest, my drink was just okay. It wasn't too sweet which was nice and the foam..well like the name says it has a subtle cheese aftertaste. However, my cousin said her Ujicha seemed to be watered down and did not like it. 

We did like the sample of the matcha ice cream though, it had that slight bitterness to it. What I didn't like and this was mentioned by Rachael T. in the previous review that we were given just one sample to share...ummm but we are two people?? I was confused. I guess they're being stingy. I don't think I will return unless they have those little cakes I saw but they had pretty much nothing aside from their drinks when we visited."}
{"text":"I came at around 10PM with some family and my boyfriend. They apparently don't close until much later. I was shocked to find that they had only ONE item available throughout the whole menu: matcha soft serve. 

I ended up getting that. The soft serve itself was definitely more bitter tasting, and I guess more bold like in comparison to Tsujiri's soft serve. Tsujiri's matcha soft serve is more mild and subtle. Both are decent, just depends on the strength of matcha you prefer

I was mostly disappointed that they didn't have anything to try other than the ice cream...why do you bother staying open if there's only one item available...? At least to me it doesn't make sense. But hey, what do I know, I know nothing about opening a new business.

I would come back to try their other cakes and items, just to see...that is if it's still available."}
{"text":"Small little shop that serves great matcha treats. I got the matcha soft serve while my bf got the swirl (matcha and charcoal). I got the regular cone. The actual ice cream had a nice subtle matcha taste and it was a bit grainy (I kinda liked that tho) there was nothing special about the cone though, it tastes like styrofoam. 

The charcoal was interesting but the flavor was very subtle, it came with some tapioca and lychee balls that gave it an interesting texture."}
{"text":"*rubs hands* HERE WE GO. 3rd update. You'll always see at least one of Chris/Max (the owners), at the shop making fresh tapioca batches daily. Since my last review they've worked out many kinks in the shop with a few more changes/additions coming in the future according to Chris.

I covered the quality of their soft serve in a prev review so I don't feel that I have to review it again. They've added a second machine which has red bean & black sesame alongside the staple matcha & charcoal. Anyways, yummy soft serve as always (no more matcha powder clumps since the incompetent trainee was fired) and I needn't say more about it.

I'm not a big fan of cheese foam so I will let someone else review those. I am, however, a big fan of milk tea. The ogasa milk tea and roasted milk tea might be some of the best milk tea I've tasted. Very unique flavor profile. They make your tea with a default sugar lvl but u can customize it to ur liking just like the 6 other bbt places at commerce gate. My friend and I got to try some rose milk tea on our most recent visit (not available to customers at the moment... I believe they are experimenting with it). It had a very strong floral taste and was more perfumey than the ogasa which was interesting. They are also using one of the most expensive roasted blends on the market.

Since my last review, I've been able to try almost all the tapioca flavors. Here are my personal recommendations/rankings.

1) Sesame: BAZINGA! Hands down, best all-round (pairs well in most, if not all, of their drinks) flavor imo. I could chew on these for days. Ideally enjoyed with one of their milk teas. I wish they would make a batch of these everyday. 

2) Sakura: fruity taste and goes well with milk or non-milk tea but paired best with a non-milk tea like golden melon, momo oolong or white peach oolong.

3) Mango: same as the sakura. Sometimes hit or miss with the flavor. The initial batch I first tried didn't have enough mango flavor. But each successive time it's been good. Best paired with non-milk tea. White peach oolong with mango taps is a go-to combo for moi.

4) Matcha: these were sometimes quite bitter, sometimes perfect. But when it was just right it paired nicely with non-milk tea. Particularly one of their matcha drinks, osmanthus or gold phoenix tea.

5) Butterfly Pea Flower: kinda tasted like a mix between blueberry and raspberry flavor. Extremely fruity taste. Again, paired best with non-milk tea.

6) Taro: these were above avg. Tbh, they tasted similar to the regular unflavored pearls you get at chatime. There's a hint of taro taste to differentiate from a regular pearl. Not a bad thing I guess cuz some ppl prefer less flavor in their tapioca. Paired best with one of their milk teas.    

7) Crystal: plain jello taste. I thought it would taste like lychee but nah haha. Looks cool while sitting in your non-milk tea though. Reminds me of kanting jelly but I like the texture of kanting jelly more

NOTE*: The grass jelly in their roasted milk tea is also made using proper brown sugar (the way it's made in taiwan) as opposed to regular white sugar which a lot of bbt places use. *ahem chatime im looking at u*

STILL WANT TO TRY: sweet potato and purple yam tapioca. I'm hesitant to try strawberry tapioca cuz I think it might be too sweet.

I know they used to serve tea mousse, but I'm not sure if they serve it anymore since the menu revamp. Make sure you call in or msg them on IG or FB to see what tapioca flavor they're making on a given day. Chris also informed me that he will likely be upgrading to a better cutting and rounding machine soon.

Price-wise, I do believe they are matched fairly against the surrounding competitors (I call commerce gate, bbt haven lol) and while I appreciate that The Alley literally right next door makes great bbt and handcrafted tapioca as well, these guys also make quality bbt and their drinks are severely underrated imo. Come order and you be the judge!"}
{"text":"When we came here for the first time, I tried their hot matcha latte with Sakura handcrafted tapioca. I thought the matcha flavour was actually pretty strong, despite the workers telling us that the matcha powder used in the drinks is slightly weaker than the one used in their matcha ice cream. 

We went back a second time 2 days ago, and I got the same drink (cold this time). However, the matcha flavour was not as pronounced this time. 

We plan to give their ice cream a try next time!"}
{"text":"LOL HYPE HYPE HYPE!!! It is not real.
I've never been one to listen to toronto blogs or \"instagram foodies\" in terms of deciding where to eat. This place is just your ol' typical asian soft serve ice cream. Comes in handy on a hot day but the taste isn't all there. The service here is alright, not fast but not slow. They take their time to make sure the ice cream sits perfectly on the cone.

Matcha ice cream taste - very bland on matcha, the cone is whatever
Red bean ice cream taste - this is the only thing here that brings the rating up. This is pretty unique and does have a nice red bean flavour #WhenYouCarryTheTeam

The regular ice creams are around $5, I always get that mini one- I find the regular way too big.

I also saw they have charcoal ice cream now- with gold flakes... it's almost $12!!! Let me tell you.. charcoal ice cream is not that big of a hoot. It tastes like straight vanilla. Gold flakes also have no flavour. If you're buying this, I guarantee you're only buying it to take a pic for your instagram and if you're a kind of person to splurge just to show off for social media, I feel bad for ya man. But good on Matcha for knowing the #basic clientele they have nowadays, eh? $$$ for them.
(haha I bet I just offended half of you reading this. As I always say- I never point out names, but if the shoe fits...)

All in all, Matcha needs to step up their matcha game. If you're looking for a nice matcha flavour, I'd go down to tendou and grab a cone there instead."}
{"text":"I simply just can't recommend Matcha's soft-serve ice cream here. We initially tried coming here during the winter months but they were closed. After seeing the extensive coverage on social media, we were excited to try this place but it didn't meet expectations. 

We went with the matcha and charcoal twist which was $6 in a cone. The flavours and textures simply didn't resonate. Good ice cream is fundamentally creamy and matcha's soft serve was a lot more icy than it should have been. The end result is that you don't have that creamy, delicate smoothness. In addition, the ice cream tasted 'powdery' in texture and lacked flavour and boldness. The matcha was weak and dilute and the charcoal was entirely tasteless. To make matters worse, the soft serve is hallow in the centre, and the cone was practically leaking from the bottom and melted quickly; a sign that it's mostly water. 

That being said, matcha should focus on and would benefit from making a high quality soft-serve. A creamy, and smooth soft-serve with bold authentic flavours would do wonders instead of focusing on gimmicks."}
{"text":"This is so much better than what I expected! Mango cup was so yummy and the roasted tea was super g ood as well :)"}
{"text":"The order just takes way too long. For a cup of tea, I waited 20 minutes and it was WAY too hot. It ruined my black tea and the food is below average. Not worth going back or mentioning to friends about."}
{"text":"Expensive and has potential. We came here after eating a late dinner and so unfortunately, by the time we arrived, a lot of the products were out. 

I like that they have free wi-fi and a nice seating area. I understand matcha is expensive but the prices were a bit high for me and not really outstanding."}
{"text":"I love matcha, so this was just what I needed.... my friend and I walked in around 10pm and we were offered a sample of matcha green tea ice cream... oddly, we were given one little taster cup... to share. Common courtesy and hygiene policy here but I think everyone deserves their own sample. Not sure if they were being stingy or just thought it was okay. Personally, I don't think it is acceptable... especially when I saw two individual samples were given to a couple later in the night.

Anyways back to the main event - seems like at the hour we went, everything was out - no black sesame, no swiss roll cakes, and we were basically left with the short end of the stick. I got the red bean milk tea, which in fact was quite tasty. I asked for no extra sugar  - the tea was not overpowering and there was definitely a good taste of red bean throughout. However, they need to step up their attention to detail. I clearly asked for no ice, I heard it get repeated twice and yet, there is still ice in my cup. Their drink making machines are a little interesting and I'm not sure if it is clear what exactly is in the drink in terms of milk to tea to water ratio. At least what I was informed was not represented in the end product.

It's worth a try, and the ice cream sample was very tasty. Go early if you want options."}
{"text":"A fan of this place to get my crave of matcha latte (hot) as well as their soft serve ice cream.  Friend of mines Jason M. said this place was bomb and it really was.  A good place overall where their matcha is quite legit and tasteful and does not feel like it came from a tea bag or low quality mix.  Went almost close to every week the last couple of months and only really stopped to go to the alley next store, but will continuously interchange as it is just that good.  

Great use of a specialist type environment where if you have a matcha or green tea craving, this is the place for you.  

PS. Their mango fruit cup looks really good with massive chunks of mango up top.  Saw a kid get it and he was just enjoying himself like a bauss"}
{"text":"This place has the best matcha icecream!!  I love everything matcha, and I have been looking for a good place to have matcha icecream.  Usually, green tea icecream are too sweet or too bland, but this place is amazing! Must try 

I'm not a big fan of mousse in general, not into salty things in my sweet drink. So I didn't try any of their mousse. But they matcha latte was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"With 'Matcha' as part of the company name, I certainly have some high expectation with their matcha product. I was very excited to try this place since I am a big matcha and sesame fan. To my disappointment, the matcha ice cream has little to no flavor. If I close my eyes, I would not guess that it was matcha ice cream I was eating. The sesame ice cream actually has more flavor than the matcha but I have better sesame ice cream from T&T supermarket than this one. The last needle to the coffin is that it costs $7 for this water down ice cream. Overall, super disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in here because I saw some new ice cream dessert cups.  It was my birthday and I wanted to get something special.

It wasn't busy, several staff were working.  I go in and I wait.  One staff was on the phone with her back towards me, while one of the owners was busy talking to two other staff.  I looked at the menu, and my phone went off (the girl on the phone looked at me) but no acknowledgement on her part.

I decided I was going to take my money somewhere else...

Strike 2 on the second visit."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends for a drink. Ordered Korean honey Citron lemon drink. Unlike other bubble tea places the don't allow you to customize the sugar level of your drink. My drink tasted very watered down. Same with my friends - the ordered mango slush tea and they said the same."}
{"text":"Edible gold ice cream is sold here and it definitely looks amazing! I have previously had this in Japan and would say that the price point is about double in Toronto. 

The flavours of the charcoal ice cream is not strong and it is not as concentrated as I would have hoped for (it looks grey rather than black). The cone does taste great though!

Their matcha ice cream had a lot of heavy cream and the matcha flavour wasn't as strong as I had liked. 

Overall, I would recommend just trying the gold cone as it's quite unique!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Came at around 1pm, no ice cream available even though they open at 12pm. Told us had to wait 30 minutes. Friend and I ordered red bean latte and black sesame latte. Red bean was alright, a bit on the sweet side; black sesame on the other hand had no flavour, just tasted like hot milk.

We also ordered a hokkaido matcha cookie \"lava\" cake and a roll cake. Both are total disappointments. Their \"lava\" cake is known in Japan as a Hokkaido chiffon cupcake. Lava cakes, by patisserie definition, is BAKED to order. Very misleading. The cream itself was very green, yet very bland. At least it was a bit more edible than the roll cake. The sponge for the roll cake was way too dense, not soft and airy like a sponge should be. The filling was very generic, red bean mixed with whipped cream. Feeling when I ate the first and final bite: if I wanted to eat play-doh for $5, I would have went to toys'r'us instead. Took the remaining home to \"share\" with friends... Even 7 of us couldn't finish this slice of cake.

If I could give no stars I would, but I give them an \"A\" for effort; at least the bag they gave me to take home the cake was more decent to look at than the cake."}
{"text":"This place just opened and it's a tiny bit hidden INSIDE the mall next to The Alley. They have two choices of ice cream red bean and matcha and it is possible to get it swirled. They also have crepe cake, matcha filled toast and iced matcha lattes. The matcha latte is very very very good. You can taste it's real matcha and you get this cute reusable cup with it! The only other matcha ice cream place I can compare it to is tendou matcha. To be honest I LOVE the black sesame there but their matcha is not as good as here! It's take out only so no places to sit. If you're in the area and looking for a quick dessert this is a good place."}

Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. My friends and I passed by this place because the line was too long at the hipster alley bubble tea place right beside it. I've never had matcha ice cream before so I was excited to give this a try. I ordered the matcha ice cream with a chocolate cone. Let's dive right into the review.

The ice cream sure looked fancy. It reminded me of the cremia ice cream I had in Japan which was amazingggg by the way. Anyways just like cremia the cone was pretty small but that wouldn't matter if it tasted amazing. Having my first bite I realized it was not the case. It had a very light matcha taste. Not very overwhelming and it would be great for people who don't like desserts too sweet. But then why would you be getting ice cream anyways :P The cone was very surprising as well. It didn't taste chocolatey at all. It tasted like any regular cone. So unfortunate that I got jebaited into paying extra for this cone.

From what I could remember this cone was expensive as well. I think it costed 7 or 8 dollars? The ice cream itself was OK but it was definitely overpriced and I was not satisfied after eating it.

In conclusion, the matcha ice cream was a good try. However I cannot confidently say that I would recommend this ice cream to others. I'd much rather order an Oreo McFlurry next time instead. That's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"Fast service, we didn't have to wait in line. We got the matcha mini cone. Very nice matcha flavor! The mini size is perfect."}
{"text":"Ok now, matcha tea and dessert is new taste and whole new world for me. This place is located on corner of west beaver creek and hwy7E right in front of TD Bank. Their is small china town where many people are socializing and feels great. Moreover, parking can be a problem yes there is lot of parking spots but security has always something new and they are prompt. 
I feel welcoming customer service was amazing helpful and this probably my first tea place where they make fresh green tea to serve as fresh. I bought matcha tea flavour silver wrapped ice cream and  fruit flavoured iced tea it's different but really good. The service is bit slow and their is good reason for that they make fresh tea which is not make with powdered products. 
The person who was making the tea was feeling the pain that he is little behind in serving ice tea but the conclusion was great. I am not saying this is the end but yes this is good place than previous places i tried. 
Pros: everything 
Cons: i wont say nothing but yes they are hard working and giving their best.
Note: 1) they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Came back here for the first time after a lengthy winter.. I had tried coming here during the winter months but they were always closed when they said they were open.. and finally found out why they were closed for most of the winter months... Anyhow I came here to try their new item the black charcoal ice cream with gold toppings which was  $11.99 and I also got the black sesame too. 

After seeing so much hype on IG, BlogT.O and other sites that were covering & highlighting this ice cream with it's unique and glamours appeal, sadly it doesn't live up to the hype as what many sites says it is. The ice cream is very gimmicky and there's really nothing special about it.  There's suppose to have a mixture of coconut and vanilla in the ice cream but I really couldn't taste any coconut.. I tasted some vanilla but it was very light in flavor, in which overall tasted very bland.. The gold toppings has zero taste or flavor.. which is just used a marketing gimmick. 

The black seasme was slightly better than the black ice cream but wouldn't totally say it was all much better either... The ice cream wasn't smooth like some soft serves. It came out gravelly with little bits which didn't give it a smooth texture. Taste wise it was also a bit bland and didn't have much taste.. For 2 of these ice creams it came out to slightly over $20.. Quite expensive for ice cream that doesn't taste very good and quality is not quite there. The black gold ice cream is really only good for IG, not really that tasty.."}
{"text":"disorganized and sold out of everything, very slow, not enough staff, no tapioca in a bubble tea shop, expensive, pretty inside"}
{"text":"This used to be a favourite dessert place but since the store's \"upgrade\" they have gotten more inflexible...they also tend to be unreliable in terms of opening on time.

Inflexibility: Tried ordering a matcha soft serve in a cup (which they used to do), only to be told that it was impossible, and that only sundaes could be ordered in a cup. For people who cannot have egg or gluten due to an allergy/intolerance, cones are out of the question. It's understandable that modifications can be tricky and cumbersome for restaurants. However, when the modification is as simple as changing from a cone to a cup, surely something can be done. 

Reliability: They don't always open on time. If you come here, make sure to call them beforehand to see if they are actually open. 

Conclusion: Unless this place becomes a little more accommodating, they have lost two regular customers."}
{"text":"I tried the red bean ice cream here, I've never had soft serve red bean ice cream before so I was pretty impressed! The green tea ice cream is a bit too strong for my tastes, but it has a really intense matcha flavour.

There was a time I came at 3 pm, and 10 minutes later it still was not open despite the posted time on the door..."}
{"text":"I order the daily special drink for $2.99. There are only two types of drink can be ordered. And the drink tasted so diluted and felt like fake juice."}
{"text":"I was looking forward for the matcha drink. I came 15mins prior opening hours but now already 4:06pm and they're still not open yet. There's approx. 10 people waiting right now."}
{"text":"TLDR: they have a lot of very unique \"for the gram\" icecreams. Is it worth it? I don't know. 

I used to work in an ice-cream store, so as you can imagine, I've eaten a lot of different ice-cream and enjoy doing so.

I chose the charcoal soft serve on a regular cone.

It was my first time having this flavour of ice-cream. And I recently had charcoal for the first time in the form of a cream puff from a grocery store. The charcoal ice-cream had tasted the same as the dark, enchanting cream puff: plain. Like nothing... Pretty disappointing. I found that the icecream wasn't even that sweet (which I guess is a good thing?) and the charcoal provided a grainy texture as the charcoal powder was kinda chunky. The flavour was like 1% milk if anything. Due to the lack of creaminess, it melted very quickly as it didn't hold as well as a regular vanilla soft serve.
I thought that the regular cone was pretty and unique, but not as functional as the traditional cake cone with a grid at the bottom. My cone leaked within 1 minute of receiving my ice-cream and no, there was no hole or breakage. The point at the thin cone just collected the quickly melting ice-cream :)
Overall, I feel like this treat is something one would only get for aesthetics or something to try once. Definitely not something someone would choose because they actually like the flavour.

I wanted to try the gold foil cone but found it a bit expensive.

Apparently this place also serves a lot of different flavoured Boba that comes in their bubble tea or SUNDAE! I think this is another unique thing they do and one that is for \"the gram\" as it isn't common and I haven't seen before."}
{"text":"I came here because of the hype and aesthetics after I saw my friend have the golden cone ($11.88 pre tax). Matcha was running a mother's day promo which was BOGO free. I first arrived without her and they said I couldn't get the promo without her, so I left and brought her with me 5 minutes later. We both tried the Matcha Ice cream ($5.50) on a charcoal cone ($0.50). I like that the ice cream itself isn't super grainy, but my mom also noticed something that wasn't great about the ice cream as well... It wasn't very creamy. I'm not sure which milk they use but I suspect skim milk or had more water to make the ice cream than usual because it started to feel like I was biting flavoured ice rather than enjoying ice cream. As for the cone, both my mom and I were fans! I liked the flavour that complimented the matcha. The only drawback to the cones for me was that my ice cream melted fairly quick and I had to clean up the mess when the melted ice cream dripped out of my cone at the bottom. 

Overall, matcha is decent, and the cashiers are pretty friendly too, but it will just be a one-time novelty for me."}
{"text":"Tried again today, seem they do pay attention to the advice, enrich red bean favor. Good ice cream, highly recommended."}
{"text":"It was the best matcha ice cream place the last times I've been. 2 stars, but +1 star only because I know how good this place usually is.

But WTH did they do with this batch of ice cream? It was super grainy - there were balls of matcha powder. Did they even try to blend the matcha in? Definitely gonna try the ice cream each time before I buy from now on."}
{"text":"I was very excited to find out that they were opening this location uptown at Commerce Gate. I literally work across the street - so this was perfect! It is located beside The Alley bubble tea place... tucked in a unit inside the plaza. It is still currently open from 4pm to 12am - been checking from time to time - I hope they will soon open during lunch hours because my coworkers are all dying to try it ^^

The first time I heard about Matcha Tea & Dessert was at the Sweetery Toronto one year ago. I remember instantly falling in love with their version of Matcha soft serve - the bitter/sweetness was just right - and the Hokkaido Chiffon Cake they offered at that time was also very tasty. 

I don't think they have the chiffon cake at this location (yet...?) but they do have a nice red bean flavour soft serve, as well as, hot and cold beverages, and delicious homemade mochis! I think they might also be offering Teppan (rolled) ice cream as well. I see the equipment and utensils but I can't confirm since I always walk by it when they are closed lol.

I actually enjoy the red bean soft serve very much - I personally love red bean and it was a nice complementary flavour to the matcha when you get the twist :) The mini one is on a sugar cone... tbh, it was a good size for me already. But if you are doing it for IG, get the waffle cone which is their regular size.

I haven't tried their mochis yet but my friend who bought them said they were very good. I will be back to try more items! Keep up the great work :D"}
{"text":"Disappointed. We were really excited to try this place out! Opening hours are at 4PM, but no one came in until 4:10. We were told that the ice cream will take 20 minutes to be ready. Waited and still closed."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of time. People here are always nice. Mocha red bean smoothy is good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and my wife and have tried red bean, matcha and black sesame ice creams. The flavours are very strong and nice and so we can taste the premium quality and it is not too sweet. The charcoal waffle coan is also a nice bonus. Overall, will definitely come back with a good experience."}
{"text":"I am in love with matcha ice cream and have been on the hunt for the best for a while. 

I've been to tendou matcha and it sucks so bad compared to matcha tea and dessert. 
Their matcha is quite strong here so it presents the bold flavours very well! I was ecstatic since I used to settle for tendou for my matcha cravings but now this is going to be my new matcha spot. 
Highly highly recommend the matcha ice cream!! 

The red bean ice cream personally for me was still quite good. It had a slightly smokey flavour.. if that makes sense.. but i didn't really mind it ! 
However, I'm taking one star because the combo of the matcha and red bean was not the greatest."}
{"text":"It's hard to review this cafe, mainly because I do feel there is a lot of potential here due to the creativity of some items, such as the cream cheese foam matcha lattes. 

However I think some management issues might be holding this place back. The cafe always seem to have items there are not available, as there are stickers covering up menu items all the time. 

I do enjoy the matcha soft serve here, as the taste is comparable to that of Tsujiri. The matcha chiffon lava cake is also not bad. Although I feel this place can benefit greatly if they knock down their prices just a little bit to be more competitive and to attract more people given their somewhat low rating."}
{"text":"The passion fruit oolong tea was the worst bubble tea I have ever tried in my life. I'll just be frank, if you're not fond of the tartness of tea and bitterness, you will hate this drink. It tasted like medicine! I waited quite some time before they took my order, even though it was just me and my friend in the line, only to realize that they were out of mango syrup (i wanted the mango qq drink) so i got a peach oolong tea instead. That one was bitter as well, but better than the passion fruit drink. The door in the back of the place was open, and there was a strong smell of weed coming through, which was annoying for a few minutes. There were some positives about this place though! The seating at the back is very cute, but if you choose to sit on the tables on the left, there's not a lot of leg room. The tapioca was also pretty good, it was chewy and soft- a perfect consistency. Their washrooms downstairs were pretty clean and nice looking, but I don't think I would come here again based on the price and the drink... maybe i'll stick to milk teas- next time."}
{"text":"Decided to give this new place a try after seeing the little sign outside their door! The matcha ice cream was AMAZING. It tasted really authentic and it wasn't too sweet. The matcha flavor was very strong as well! The consistency was a but slushy but the taste makes up for it completely. You can ask the servers to give you little samples of the flavors to try before purchasing. The red bean was really nice as well, not overly sweet. But matcha is still my favorite! Would definitely recommend to my friends and will be visiting often! 

Update: 
Extremely disappointed that Matcha has been closed for two days in a row with no sign or post at all. Inconsistent operating hours really wastes customer's time. Have went out of my way twice in two days just to go but still closed! Really sad :("}
{"text":"I had their twist (matcha + red bean) mini cone a few days ago, and I already forgot about it. Uh oh.

If you are a red bean ice cream fan, you will like their red bean soft serve because it's quite tasty and similar to the ice cream tubs you get in Asian supermarkets. But then again....you can also just get the tubs from Asian supermarkets. 

I don't really remember their matcha flavour very much--not very memorable. I think it might have been over powered by the red bean ice cream, or there wasn't as much TEA taste as I was expecting. 

I do think that the matcha and red bean flavour complimented each other much better than Tendou's matcha and black sesame. However, they are more expensive here, and so I probably won't be frequenting Matcha Tea & Dessert when there's cheaper options with equally decent matcha soft serve elsewhere. 

Overall, it was a satisfactory ice cream cone, and the red bean soft serve is pretty unique in Markham (though not any better than the ones you get from supermarkets). Nonetheless, I might stop by again if I'm in the area and I feel like splurging."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try out this place, but was fairly disappointed when I did. 
I had the sesame latte, mochi ball and lava green tea cake. Pictures are deceiving... The two cakes were miniscule and kind of expensive for a $5 mochi to only discover there's only whip cream & very small and little mango bits inside the mochi. The earl grey milk tea was probably the best choice. Even the sesame latte ordered was just milky taste, not much of sesame taste. When I ordered, they didn't even tell me or asked if I wanted a regular or large drink. But just charged me a large and made an assumption that I wanted a large."}
{"text":"Stopped in expecting desserts but ended up just getting a matcha cheese foam tea. Very good and refreshing! Not too sweet, but the foam adds just the right hint of sweetness and thickness to the matcha tea. Only seems to be one person working but the store was pretty empty so service was quick. Cute store, just not too many dessert options. Maybe cause we were here at around 6?"}
{"text":"Many Yelpers have commented on how spectacle the matcha is here - the strong flavour and even the bitterness! I was expecting just that however, I barely taste the claimed spectacular... I tasted a hint of matcha and that was about it... :( On the other hand, I did taste the red bean more strongly and it's funny because Yelpers have said otherwise! Anywho, I'm still up for another visit to give their matcha another try and also their black sesame."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review is not sponsored in any form. No free item in exchange for my review (During their Grand Opening, free mini cone was given out in exchange for a post or review on Social Media)

I love Matcha and was excited that this new Matcha Tea & Dessert opens at Commerce Gate. 

On a Wednesday afternoon, this place was not busy. I was debating what to order, the friendly staff suggest the twist: Matcha and Red Bean. I wanted to get the mini size, but since I want that in a cup, he said only in regular size ($6). 

The soft serve looks good for the photo. I do like the texture: heavy and denser compares to others and it took awhile to melt. What it is lacking though is taste. I know most Asian dessert of trying to make it not too sweet but the flavour profile was just off! Maybe Red Bean and Matcha does not work together? There was this smokey after taste of me just having a cigarette! 

The staff was nice enough to ask me how was it. I did tell him the truth and he mentioned that they uses Taiwanese Black Sugar as sweetener. This might be the problem since this type of sugar though is a healthier option but has a more smokey-malt taste to it. And the different in texture is probably from the molasses of the sugar.

Hopefully, Matcha Tea & Dessert would work on a better tasting profile as personally I don't think that having a smokey after taste is the way to go for soft serve!"}
{"text":"Took off 2 stars because closing hours are inconsistent with their yelp page AND the sign on their door. As a business, it's your responsibility to update it and make sure it's accurate. Came here on 2 separate occasions well before 12 (their closing time) - once around 11 and once around 10 and they were CLOSED. Really deters me from wanting to come here again in the future because it's a waste of time if it's closed. 

Their softserves, however, are incredible. They only ever have 2 flavours at a time. I think they rotate between red bean & matcha and black sesame & matcha. The red bean soft serve is what I will keep coming back for as it's the only place I've ever seen do a red bean soft serve. It's creamy and not too sweet. Their matcha soft serve is also well done; the matcha flavour is very strong! I appreciate that they offer mini cones for those who don't want to commit to a full size cone. Oh and they allow you to sample the flavours if you ask :)"}
{"text":"This store calls \"Matcha\". You would have high expectation on the name if you are matcha lover and have tried real \"Uji\" matcha at Uji. 

 I ordered Uji matcha. Of course without sugar. Uji matcha is premium and very expensive matcha. No one would put sugar in it . 

Staff was sort of hesitating making my \"Uji matcha without sugar\". I was looking how they make my drink. It was very interesting. My so-called Uji matcha came out from machine by pressing button, and he put scorching hot boiling water, then put in blender.... Sure I didn't see any actions of he putting sugar into my drink. 

It came with a giant cup. I think it was as big as pint of beer. And omg, it was pint of green sugar water!!! Literally!!!

I asked him nicely. \" I am so sorry but I asked for no sugar?\" 

And gentleman said that he didn't put any sugar. Apparently their matcha is pre-mixed with sugar and powder milk. 

I asked if I can see the packages if they are actually Uji matcha. Of course he refused to show the packages. 

Then I asked him where your matcha is coming from. He said its from Japan. I asked \"whereabouts Japan?\" He said he is not sure. 

Yes the gentleman was even didn't know that \"Uji\" is region of matcha.

He admitted that it's not real matcha after I accused. Yes It's artificially modified enhanced green tea flavor powder. Well Now you should change your store name."}
{"text":"I finally got to check this place out and it's a cute little matcha shop with a good selection that you don't get so confused on what to order.

I got the matcha soft serve and really enjoyed it.  It's in my top places to go to for matcha soft serve.  A must try if ur in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here before and one of the machines was not working. The next time I can was at 8:30 pm and the store had a sign that said be back in 3 minutes. I thought that it was reasonable to wait. I walked around and came back 10 minutes later. Still no one. I decided to run another errand thinking maybe it was possible that someone would return. I walked to the boba shop across and one of the workers reported that the sign was up there by 6:30pm that night and no one returned since. Very disappointed. As I decided to get boba, I saw multiple people make the attempt, wait around and then come back. Not sure if this was an off night or this is a typical business behavior"}
{"text":"I was excited to see the opening of this dessert store beside my beloved \"The Alley\".  I almost tried it many times, but it opens at 4pm and I ended up leaving before that.  

I finally made a visit during their opening hours last week, and I was not particularly impressed.  I had the Matcha soft serve.  As a matcha lover, I wasn't wowed by it.  I wanted more matcha flavour, like that of Tendou.  I can't say I'll be back anytime soon.  The seating as also extremely limited, which makes it less appealing for groups of friends."}
{"text":"A hidden little gem in Toronto's Chinatown, this place is modern, clean and trendy with nice interior decor pleasing to the eye.  The size of the dessert restaurant is small, creating a sense of intimacy.
People ordered from the counter at the front, and there was a menu to select from on the wall.  What's nice is that there was a top 10 most popular drinks shown.  
I ordered Wen Shan Green Tea, which came in a choice of either cold or hot.  The staff recommended i get it cold, so i went with that.  My friends and i sat down at a table and our drinks were brought to us.  It took a little bit longer and the server was very apologetic about it.  The wait wasn't that bad though.  
Wen Shan Green Tea was as refreshing as the staff said.  What was a pleasant surprise to me was that it was not sweet like a lot of other drinks at other cafes.  I really enjoyed the cold brew and will definitely visit this gem of a place when i am in chinatown again."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for Matcha yet. This little shop is located at Commerce Gate and you might miss it if you're not looking for it. It's located right beside The Alley with the cutest little table and chairs out front. 

The standard menu includes Matcha, Sesame & Red Bean. My favourite of these three is Sesame. I've only had the Matcha once and it seemed a little powdery so I haven't ordered it since. The taste was similar to Tsujiri but more creamy + sweet. I've also had a sample of the Red Bean but I'm not a fan of Red Bean. 

What's most captivating to me is their limited edition flavours. They have their famous Charcoal cone with Gold or Silver foil which has been taking over instagram. The Charcoal is a mix of coconut and vanilla (not my personal fav).

I do want to try their plethora of limited edition flavours ranging from Marshmellow, Lavender, Japanese Ramune, London Fog, Pineapple and more! A lot of these flavours are only available for one day but may make a comeback.

I tried the limited time Thai Milk Tea and the Tieguanyin soft serve, both of which are delicious. I think the Thai Milk Tea was the most delicious soft serve I ever had! I will say that it was a little sweet towards the end, but it is the most perfect form of Thai Milk Tea as a soft serve.

The Tieguanyin soft serve is great alternative if you prefer the tea flavour over the sweetness. 

I've always been helped by Chris every time I'm there and I've never seen anyone else working. He is very friendly and always looking for ways to improve. When we had the Charcoal ice cream, he gave my friend and two cups of warm water without us even asking (because that stuff gets all over your mouth)! When I had the Thai Milk Tea, he asked if it needed any tweaking, whether or not it was too sweet. 

The only downside is their operating hours. I wish they were open during lunch hours but they don't open until 4pm."}
{"text":"A great spot if you're craving matcha ice cream! I got the matcha and red bean twist, which was reasonably priced. Their ice cream comes in two sizes: mini and regular. The quality of the ice cream is top notch as the matcha flavour really shines through and the red bean tastes fresh - unlike the frozen variety you may find at buffets. Thankfully the wait times are short (for now) so you'll be able to quickly fulfill your ice cream craving."}
