{"text":"Great place to stop in for home cooking including stuffed peppers. The pizza is delicious along with their Pierogies.   It's nice to have a place to go for great food in Ambridge. They also cater, have a banquet room, and have take out."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and homey! I believe it's a wife and  husband who own and run it. She is front of the house and makes the dessert and then the husband cooks in the back. The place is small and homey. Nothing fancy but that's not a bad thing.   Small bar with a limited selection but the food more than makes up for it! They had multiple specials and the wife was beyond friendly to let us know what was good. We had the hot sausage peppers which were spicy and delicious. They came with small warm rolls that they put in the toaster over but they are addicting. I ordered the gnocchi which is always a hard one but decent. Next time I will just get the spaghetti with hot sausage pepper. We were definitely stuffed by the end of the meal but we took dessert to go.   To end the night we had strawberry cheesecake and it was wonderful!"}
{"text":"John and Rose run a first class, hometown restaurant.  Most of the food is homemade and well prepared.  The only item I had that was not was the Pierogies, but otherwise it was all very good.  The atmosphere is wonderful.  Rose is the baker and John is the cook and bartender.    I would return to this place in a heartbeat.  Don't expect this to be a gourmet restaurant, but a hometown restaurant with an adequate bar.  Not many seats in the place, thus, if you have a larger group, you may want to inquire about the party room in the basement ahead of time."}
{"text":"This was an amazing place! We had pepperoni rolls, stuffed cabbage, homemade dinner rolls, haluski, pierogies, and pizza! Everything was amazing!!!!  Rose and John are the owners and are just lovely. This made our trip back to PA!!!!   I recommend this to everyone that lives in the area or visiting."}
