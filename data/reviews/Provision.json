{"text":"We came for Sunday brunch and had horrible service. We were a table of 7, and had to wait for our waters to be refreshed, our coffee took 20 min to come and we were only offered drinks once. The eggs Benedict portion was small, so small I thought about ordering another dish. Along with the benedict, it came with 10 potato cubes and a few pieces of fruit. They had ran out of the brunch special beer, strawberries, and asparagus, for a Sunday brunch seems ridiculous.  My meal came to 35$ because of the automatic 15% tip, which our waitress did not deserve."}
{"text":"Perfectly prepared meat and veg dishes. Lamb and duck in particular were just amazing! Brussel sprouts and parsley root were fantastic as well. Great wine list. We thought service could have been a bit more attentive, but not bad either. Cheese board options weren't as flavourful as we hoped, but we had to go with their pasteurized options because I'm expecting so that could be the issue. Still giving it five stars because the food quality of the prepared dishes just knocked it out of the park."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to indulge over beautiful dishes that the restaurant have provided here! Dishes are meant to be shared, so it is a perfect choice when you have friends or family gathering!   I was here on a Tuesday evening for a family reunion dinner, with a group of 5 of us, we have tried almost everything on the menu, from 6 vegetable dishes to 5 meat dishes, and ended with 3 different kind of desserts to fulfill our sweet teeth! With the skillful execution on each dish, outstanding presentation on the plating by Chef Kevin Yang when it comes to Dessert, and last but the least, delicious flavors on each dish, absolutely brought our taste buds to a completely different level!   We were all impressed with the atmosphere, the food and all the laugh that we had together at the restaurant, it have definitely created another amazing moment to our family reunion again! We will sure coming back again but probably would wanna see the spring/summer scene next time since it's located at the Central Memorial Park, can't wait! :)"}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday for dinner with my three siblings. The food was tasty but the service was embarrassing. Our bill was at $200 and we didn't want to spend anymore due to the poor service we were receiving. We decided to go somewhere else for dessert and drinks to end our evening on a better experience."}
{"text":"This little restaurant tucked into Central Memorial Park embodies the best of Calgary. The wine list is well curated, all the food is locally inspired and the decor is cozy. On my last visit, I had the burger with a side salad and my friend ordered the chicken. Both were cooked perfectly and so so good. Usually, I would have ordered dessert because they are made by their very impressive pastry chef but I was too full. I recommend saving room for something sweet!"}
{"text":"Visited Provision as part of Big Taste, on a cold and snowy Saturday the cozy and warm interior of Provision was a perfect atmosphere. It's a pretty small space so you will be close to your neighbors but the wood interior and warm lighting really set a nice tone, especially during winter. I ordered the arancini to start, chicken and gnocchi for a main and the carrot cake for dessert. Hubs ordered the broccolini to start, chicken and gnocchi for a main and the chocolate torte for dessert. The arancini was delicious, the sauce it was plated on was fresh and the acidity in the arugula cut through the richness of the dish, so delicious! Hubs said he really enjoyed the brocollini and how it all came together. The main was really good, the chicken was cooked perfectly, the gnocchi were a good texture but a little bit bland, overall it was still a tasty main. Dessert was delicious, the carrot cake was the perfect amount of sweet with the cream cheese topping, the chocolate torte was very rich, I sampled a bit of it and although hubs didn't finish it, he did say it was very satisfying. We also shared a 1/2 bottle of wine and I really appreciated that you could get a half bottle, it was the perfect amount."}
{"text":"We walked around the Central Park and then decided to stop by for the dessert. We got Vanilla strawberry semifreddo. It was delicious especially when there were tiny tomatoes infused with strawberry and slides of strawberries infused with tomatoes. Also there was some tiny flowers and greens in the same plate. The tomatoes were the best to pair with strawberries and semifreddo."}
{"text":"Stayed in Calgary for a week and was searching for some of the best places to eat in the city, Provision came up on multiple lists, so my partner and I made a reservation.  The restaurant, which is perfectly situated in the city's Central Memorial Park, is cute and cozy and feels as if you're in a cabin in the woods. Super Canadiana chic. When we arrived, there were two other tables currently seated and although we had arrived ten minutes early for our reservation, the waitress was more than willing to accommodate us.   The menu is seasonal and fresh, with a focus on local and organic produce and meats. We ordered the tuna crudo ($19) and beet salad ($13) to start, and they were bright, fresh and beautifully done. The best way to describe both dishes is simple ingredients, well done.   My partner ordered the Pacific salmon ($26) for their main dish and I ordered the Alberta Pork Chop ($27) for my main. I found that my pork chop was a bit overcooked for my taste, but the warm potato salad was straight up ridiculous. The salmon was perfectly cooked, firm to touch and just delicious.   We were so happy with our meal here and knew if this was the kind of service and food to kick off our journey in Calgary, we were going to be having a great time. Thanks for making our first meal in Calgary so special."}
{"text":"Provision opened two days ago as I write this (on December 10th) and as such most people arent aware that it's opened, so when I popped in just before noon I was the only customer. This was actually quite a nice thing as I got to chat extensively with the manager, exec chef and the pastry/sous chef. All wonderful people. It was brunch time so I ordered off that menu and got steak and eggs, the priciest thing for brunch at $25 (everything else is much more reasonable but I've never in my 52 years on this planet ordered steak and eggs and decided to treat myself).  It was just outstanding. The portion wasn't massive but every bite was delectable. A perfect cooked to medium steak (skirt I think, a relatively robust cut, cooked perfectly I repeat) with the most fantastic, lemony hollandaise atop- one of the best two restaurant hollandaise sauces in memory, the other one being at Full Circle's brunch- with gorgeous crispy potatoes, two perfectly (see the trend here?) cooked eggs and I got a couple of slices of toast from a house-made white bread aside. It was just magical.   This is a great use of a great space from the Avec Bistro folks. Great experience start to finish."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning to see grab a couple of treats for brunch at home. Hadn't really heard much about this place and was pleasantly surprised by what I found.  The staff that greeted me were friendly, enthusiastic and knowledgeable. I ended up ordering a rosemary white chocolate scone and a shortbread cinnamon bun along with two lattes.  The rosemary scone was perfect. The rosemary and white chocolate created a flavour combo that I never would have thought of but was delectable.  The shortbread cinnamon bun was amazing and threw a nice twist on the boring cinnamon bun that you find at other restaurants.  Checked out the menu while there and everything looked amazing. I will be heading there again soon to try some of the meals!!"}
{"text":"Was here while in town. Place was very small,  but bright and really beautiful inside and out. I had the tomato salad and the 6 oz steak. The menu here is divided by a few starters (maybe 6?) a few meats and then some sides (also maybe 6?). It's not the cheapest restaurant though, be warned. The tomato salad was great tasting; with big heirloom tomatoes, garlic focaccia pieces and fior so latte cheese. Worth 16$? Absolutely not. The 6oz steak was SMALL (my entire table asked where the rest of it was..) and no one at my table who ordered beef was asked how they'd like it cooked. As a result, it came a bit too rare for my taste, but I ate it anyways. It tasted okay.  Overall this place was OKAY, but I think was a little too pricey for what you got."}
