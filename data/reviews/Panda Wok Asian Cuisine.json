{"text":"I have eaten at panda walk many times, either take out or in the restaurant itself. The dining experience is very beautiful and quiet. The last two times I have ordered carry out have been miserable. This time, I was livid. I usually would not write a review and complain, I just will not patronize your establishment anymore. This time was too much. The young lady at the counter was so rude. From the time I placed my order on the phone and then as I picked up my order, she had a problem with me. I've worked in the service industry long enough to know that the customer is always right and you keep them happy. Cleveland, Ohio is not a rude place. She has no idea where she works or what she does. I have tried twice to call back and complain, but have yet to speak with any type of management. This just tells me that there's really no management at all. That shows in the quality of their food recently and in the quality of their employees. I only left the second star because of the great food and service I've had in the past."}
{"text":"Pad Thai with shrimp no spice and Mongolian beef was delicious.  The hostess/server was friendly and comforting."}
{"text":"One night I had a taste for some egg foo Young. I use to go to Panda Wok but I  stopped. I decided  to try them out again since it's under New Management.  What a surprise.  The food was fresh the gravy wasn't  burnt. I was shocked because after a year ago I  stopped going because I got sick. This time I  can TRULY say that NEW MANAGEMENT  and NEW  COOKS made a difference. PANDA prices may have changed, but it's well worth it. The Shrimp Fried Rice is another favorite of mine. Yes the shrimp  were fresh too and nothing was burnted. And Rachel  was amazing. She took the time to complete  my order and made sure I was satisfied. Good job Rachel. And if you want a nice atmosphere, go check them out. WEST 117st. Cleveland Ohio."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to sushi and miso soup for quite awhile since I moved to Lakewood. There's just no place close around here.  I was disappointed. Sushi was just fair in taste. Fair presentation. Fair miso soup. While ingredients were good it lacked something and seemed vinegar ish. I guess I got spoiled at high end Japanese.  Sad to say I will not return."}
{"text":"3rd and last visit. Governor's Chicken soggy, gross Beef with overcooked Ho Fun noodles, Orange colored Pad Thai with teeny weeny shrimp garnished with a dried brown spotted lime wedge. $25.85 out the door. YUCK!"}
{"text":"Usually service is spot on at this location, not so much this time around.  We ordered a meal to go and when we unpacked it at home, the order was not complete.  Because the order was not complete we could not eat our meal.  I called and requested a credit, but I was told since I have part of my meal already they would only credit me for the rice.  I went on to say that we could not eat without the rice; the person on the other end apologized but Egg Foo Young and apologies do no compliment each other on a plate.  I was told that I could drive back and get what they forgot... I felt that I should not have to go back out to fix their screw up.  I feel this could have been resolved in a better manner.  We will not be eating there again.  If you get carry out double check your bag."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem on the westside of Cleveland. Tucked away in a rundown plaza. The food is good fresh and fast. Pretty decent sushi too."}
{"text":"If I am craving Chinese I will no doubt head to Panda Wok. I recommend eating in the restaurant if you have not experienced it yet. It is probably the cleanest Chinese restaurant I have been too and its obvious how fresh the food is when you dine in. My General Tso's chicken was nice and crispy and had a great flavor.

Downside, if there is any, there is no alcohol. But then again, you can always do take out. Pro tip: I come from a family of heavy eaters, but this meal is always at least two meals (it usually lasts me three!) So not only is the food good, but it is 100% worth the price"}
{"text":"Really good food with wonderful owners. The place is very clean and welcoming with some really friendly faces. They make you feel like home and are very flexible when it comes to making food to suit your personal taste. It's also a fun place to have parties at. The sushi here is really the best in this area. Thank you for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Best asian food around. They re-opened and you can eat from the floor in there. They're going to change their name and sign soon. Great ambiance - you can dress up and won't feel weird! Biggest portions ever!! (So totally worth the price!) They will add SUSHI to their menu on April 22nd :-) Can't wait!

UPDATE: Tried sushi-tasted awesome! Ask for their daily deals!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! I ordered the shrimp tempura & California rolls. My roommate had the sesame chicken with chicken fried rice. I couldn't believe how delicious the sushi was, as it was takeout food. The sesame chicken was also delicious & the chicken fried rice was perfect! Will definitely be ordering from here again!!"}
{"text":"I am so sad to have to write this review, because this used to be such a go-to place for me, but after my last two experiences, I am done.
I used to get Panda Wok for carryout and delivery (both regular food and sushi) all the time, and had even dined in on a couple occasions. I have never had a single issue with their food. The \"regular menu\" food is exactly what I look for in Chinese carryout, and the sushi is HUGE and delicious. However...
Around a month ago, the boyfriend and I ordered carryout sushi. We were told 40-50 minutes, so we got there about 45 minutes later. Our food wasn't ready, but no big deal, we still have 5 minutes left in the timeframe and it's not like it has to be exact. But then we've been sitting there for 20 minutes...then 30 minutes...then 40 minutes...with NO apologies, NO offers to comp our food and let us just go pick up some fast food, not even an offer for a coupon. One girl offered us cheesecake (which we really didn't want, we just wanted our food or to be able to leave), and then she didn't even put it in the bag with our food (that we finally got an hour and a half after ordering)! 
I should have been done there. Everything about it was so poorly handled. But I was craving sushi a couple days ago and seeing as Lakewood is currently lacking in the sushi department, I called for delivery. When I asked for delivery, they told me the sushi chef was \"on vacation\" and wouldn't be back for five more days. Seriously? You have one sushi chef and are incapable of serving a massive part of your menu when he's gone? That's actually insane. Management--time to fix this mess."}
{"text":"Great quality Chinese food. Their food is delicious and portions are huge! I love their eggrolls. I have yet to dine in, but the restaurant is beautiful inside."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I always get the chicken lettuce wraps. They are as good as p.f. Changs lettuce wraps. Which is great because the only p. F changs is half an hour away. Anyway, also try the crab rangoons for an appetizer. I've had a couple different dishes from here and they were all pretty good. Can't forget about the service, which is always good too."}
{"text":"Me and my wife love this place and it is our favorite Chinese food in the Lakewood area.  The fried rice is great, which is a key for me.  It is freshly prepared and not like the yellowish fried rice that a lot of places serve that is dry and lacks flavor.  I have always been happy with any of the dishes and the food portions are huge. So, always plenty of leftovers to enjoy the next day.  I am not a Sushi expert, but my wife is and she thinks their Sushi is pretty good also.  We normally get carryout, so I don't have anything to share about their service in the restaurant.  The food is usually ready in about 20 minutes when we call with a pickup order."}
{"text":"I really do like this place. Everything I've tried here has been quite delicious. Haven't eaten inside though, only ever had the delivery experience."}
{"text":"Great food, not the most experienced staff.  EVERY TIME I order, they cannot seem to get it correct. EVERY TIME I order, there is no history under my phone number.  The staff cannot seem to take an order over the phone in less than 5 minutes and the most recent time I ordered, the girl commented to her coworker about how difficult I was/my order was BEFORE hanging up the phone.  As much as I enjoy the food, this last order will be my last; the whole point of ordering food out is the convenience and when the experience is totally inconvenient and difficult and the staff is rude, what is the point? Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I have had worse Chinese food elsewhere. For whatever odd reason, I decided to come back to Panda Wok as I was craving some General Tso. No other place really stood out to me, so Panda Wok had to do. Ordered the combo, arrived a bit early, and left as soon as my short wait was over. I only had a 5 minute drive home. The rice was miraculously not burnt this time and tasted good, but great had I omitted the shitty beansprouts. While yet again the chicken wasn't entirely crispy with each bite, I was at least satisfied with it enough to give Panda Wok some good faith and consider coming every now and then for a General Tso combo."}
{"text":"I've tried quite a few Chinese dishes and their sushi, and I would recommend going there for sushi but not the Chinese or Asian Fusion food.  I got pad Thai that didn't taste like any pad Thai I have had before.  And that was not a good thing.  They do serve a very generous helping but that just makes me feel more guilty when I don't want to eat it."}
{"text":"First, we tried calling and no one answered, so we ordered UberEats from here. They gave us half of our order and a random assortment of other dishes. We ended up with much more food (which was great) but I have a shellfish allergy and was really cautious about eating it. My friend enjoyed her pad thai and it was cheap, so I have it 2 stars. General Tsao's chicken (I think) was just okay and fried rice was dry. I was surprised to find such good reviews on here, so I will try to actually eat at the restaurant and update this review."}
{"text":"I'm always a bit apprehensive trying a new Chinese place, but this place did not disappoint! The food and appetizers were great, they went above and beyond to make sure the vegetarian in our group got everything right in her meal and the family combo was a great deal at 12.50! We all have leftovers for lunch today!"}
{"text":"The food here I ordered was good, but the crab ragoons need to be filled with more filling. They have great flavor but definitely need more filling.  I also ordered some sushi that was the special for the day but it took wayyyyy too long for my very small order. I guess the chef ran out of stuff and he made a run to AlDI's to grab more. Hmmmmm......so no one advised me. I was kept waiting until he returned. A little bit on the tacky side if you ask me."}
{"text":"i've had good meals there in the past, and they're really nice people, but....

...not so much.

i bit into my chicken and it was dark.  like *dark* dark.
i didn't know chicken could be that dark.

when i have to question if what i'm eating is actually what i thought i was eating, i'd have to say no thanks.  i just hope at some point that meat didn't meow.
i'm giving them two stars, cuz, well, they're nice."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten at Panda Wok in almost 10 years (what can I say? I'm a Chinese take-out snob) and was skeptical even after my boyfriend gave it his take-out seal of approval after we heard it had re-opened. We went for dinner tonight and I was impressed right away with decor, cleanliness of the restaurant, and friendliness of the staff. I had the wonton soup, crab rangoon (delicious but in need of more yummy filling), and the amazingly delicious Panda sushi roll (yes, they have a sushi bar). My boyfriend had the hot and sour soup (he's a connoisseur and gave it high praise) and the Singapore noodles- spicy, which were delicious. We will definitely go back and also try their take-out menu soon."}
{"text":"This is a take-out review as I've never sat down here.   BUT...with that being said, every time I get take out its fantastic!   I've never had a gummy/chewy piece of chicken, their vegetables and rice have always been cooked perfectly, I've never had to wait, staff has been friendly, and the price is right.  No complaints whatsoever.    Even though I live farther away from Panda Wok then when I originally discovered it, it's still my go-to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Called for delivery and they never showed even after I called back agreed to possible discount but because they called me back after it was closed I just missed out on dinner I call at 8:36 they close at 10 ample time to deliver called again at 10 said the delivery was out then hung up on me when I called to get names so that my discount could be honored I was hung up on . Food is good but I'd suggest pick up one star because quite frankly I'm still angry I don't even want my discount and it will be a while before I return ."}
{"text":"What the F*$ck is going on at Panda Wok? Its been a reliable favorite for me and all of lakewood for a long time, but recently...just NO!  The last time we ordered Panda Wok for delivery it took 3 phone calls and over 1.25 hrs to get our food (and multiple excuses). Most recently, we ordered take out. My partner's Hot and Sour soups was more sour than anything else, and my sweet and sour chicken was WAY OVER FRIED. The chicken was fried dark and clearly over cooked and did I mention that it was more breading than it was chicken? (In the past-when it was good I used to get white chicken 4-6 pieces with light breading, this time, all dark meat, fried dark brown breading.) My sauce container  LITERALLY had 1 onion slice, 1 green pepper chunk, 1 red pepper chunk and 1 pineapple chunk. What the freak?  Panda Wok used to be good, but the poor quality of food and poor timing is making Panda Wok worth avoiding. So disappointing! We may have to move back to the East Side for decent chinese food."}
{"text":"I was craving Pad Thai and Thai Kitchen was closed. I won't make THAT mistake again. The meal was totally flavorless.

I will stick with their standard Chinese fare, but in Lakewood the best remains Szechuan Garden."}
{"text":"As an update I ordered again and had the pad thai. Pretty damn tasty. Not to salty, plenty of meat, perhaps could use a little sauce but  i was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"This is your typical generic Chinese food. Ordered a small wonton soup, which taste like any other wonton soup I've had from a a cheap Chinese buffet. Also ordered, sweet and sour chicken with pork fried rice. Fried rice tasted like well nothing, and then chicken is obviously frozen breaded chicken, to a point where you can't tell which is the actual chicken or which is the fake breading. If you're drunk, then you wouldn't think the food is bad. If you're sober, then you might stop and think."}
{"text":"Call me crazy, but I love this place. Cheap and delicious, and quick takeout service too. I'm obssesed with their hot and sour soup (seriously - if you are ever sick, you will feel better eating that stuff). Their UberEats selection and quality is also really nice and fresh."}
{"text":"Best tasting food friendly atmosphere.Best sushi on this planet.Very good food."}
{"text":"I think it sucks doing a crossword goodbye my chicken sweet sour chicken was still sick it was $8"}
{"text":"I recently got take out from here for the first time since the renovation and new menu. The inside looks nice the menu has changed with the addition of sushi and a price increase. 

 For just me, one entree and an appetizer to share, it was almost $18. The quality was good but nothing outstanding. And I didn't like that there's no duck sauce in the packets, they give you the same sauce for the crab rangoon which I think is too sweet for egg roll. 

The pork eggrolls btw were very good, sauce aside. My entree wasn't spicy enough regardless of the fact that I ordered it spicy but I feel like I say that in EVERY Chinese food review. This place is good, yummy I just don't get why it's so pricy."}
{"text":"I will be honest and say that I have not been impressed by the restaurants in Cleveland.  There are no shortage of Chinese restaurants in the edge water/Lakewood area.  This place is the best of all the places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by a close friend. We'll they've got some explaining to do! We had the hot and sour soup, pot stickers, and curry chicken. Not one of them were as good as our usual go to Chinese restaurant. The soup was basically all liquid with a couple small pieces of tofu. The pot stickers were average at best and the dipping sauce was bland and flat. The curry chicken was tasteless and the ingredients sparse to nonexistent. I will not be revisiting this establishment any time soon as there are too many better options when it comes to Chinese food in this area."}
{"text":"I get takeout from here when I don't feel like cooking! They have an awesome extensive Asian bistro menu and a sushi menu. I recently ordered the chicken and shrimp pad thai. Overall it tastes great, had chopped up carrots,peppers, and onions and a good amount of meat and shrimp. I ordered medium, I didn't think it was spicy tasting at all. If you like spice I'd go with the spicy! I also ordered the Dragon roll, the shrimp tempura was perfect along w he avocado and eel sauce drizzle! My favorite if you love avocado and a little crunch! The restaurant itself is also a very nice atmosphere, clean and modern."}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation from a friend and we weren't disappointed. The food was excellent - delicious and very fresh! The service was also excellent. It's a very clean, modern restaurant and also a very cozy atmosphere. This is now our go-to place!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, atmosphere and servers :p I've been working here for almost 4 yrs and the staff has become like family to me. I don't think I'll ever leave ! :) come check us out!"}
{"text":"I get Chinese from here all the time seeing as it's right around the corner from me. But the wait can sometimes be outrageous. Saturday night it took two hours to get to me. No apology or coupon or anything for taking that long. And my sushi was given to me after being upside down so it was all squished to the side of the container. For 14.50 i would expect a little more care. 

Also this is the 5th time I've gotten the crab Rangoon and there was no stuffing in it. Don't u notice when your frying it that it's seeping out the holes? U guys need to figure out a new way of making them in order for the stuffing not to seep out. Unless u guys just don't put any stuffing in there at all. I do love your sweet and sour sauce. And it was also disappointing to get a little tiny small souflet cup of it for an entire order of sweet and sour chicken. And I even asked for extra. They didn't even toss my chicken in it either. So I basically had dry chicken and rice for my dinner

I will however admit that their potstickers are amazing. And when everything is actually done right it's very good. But my recent experiences have proved otherwise and I have not gotten the quality I deserve for the prices I am paying."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and thought I would try it.  However  I was greatly disappointed. The service took forever and the food was very bland. The different dishes were hard to extinguish between.  I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"After reading reviews we decided to ordered lunch pick up from here. Picture shown was supposed to be shrimp and broccoli. It was shrimp with mixed vegetables in a white creamy sauce. It was not the typical shrimp with broccoli and the rice tasted old. Aside from this we ordered crab Rangoon appetizer and they were awful. There was literally no filling inside it was just a fried shell. Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"We've been getting delivery from here for about 4 years. Pad Thai and crab ran goons are by far our favorite option. We've also tried the sweet and sour options as well as some more traditional Asian options. Friendly service, fast delivery and always willing to go the extra mile. They were closed for over a year recently and we tried them again. The food believe it or not seems better now although I may be biased. Complete remodel of their location and it looks amazing. I see yet now offer sushi :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Great service! Nice cozy spot. We went for lunch An very much enjoyed our meal as well as the service! 5 stars  I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"OK--My fourth review update, so you know it has taken a lot of experiences, both \"OK\" and \"infuriating\" to get me to this point. 

My thoughts on the food still stand: Average sushi and typical, greasy, Americanized, Chinese take-out. I will add that while some might not find an oversized roll to be a problem, I do. This place makes rolls so massive they're difficult to eat. And isn't enjoying eating the point? I like a bite-sized roll that is a balance of all the flavors. 

Really where Panda Wok has failed me over and over again is the customer service. First, when you're placing your order make sure you do their job for them. By this I mean make them confirm your address, confirm your order, confirm they're delivering, confirm they're going to send you chopsticks, soy sauce, etc. It's exhausting, but necessary. My last three orders consisted of these experiences: 

1) Placed entire order, waited over an hour--guy shows up at the wrong address, gets snippy and blames me. Ha! I had to send the cold food back AND make a call about the crappy service of not just the women who took the order, but their delivery guy as well. 

2) Next time, I placed a complete order and got off the phone, no problem--or so I thought. I got a phone call ten minutes later from the same gal who took my order saying, \"I forgot we're not doing deliveries tonight. But I already charged you. Can you come and pick it up?\" HOW do you forget you don't have a delivery person for the evening?! They couldn't refund me the delivery charge--so they gave me a credit for my next order. 

3) Third times a charm, right? WRONG. This time I placed an order for three rolls and some soup. I get a call from the delivery guy telling me he's outside. I walk outside and there's no one there. This can't be happening again, right? I confirmed the address on the phone! I call the guy back and ask him where he is--this guys gets the nastiest attitude with me AGAIN. He reads back my address to me and my instructions to come to the front--then snips at me that there are only two side doors. SO my instructions were right, this guy is just rude. Turns out he's on the wrong street. HA. He read the address wrong. But that's not where it ends. My soup is luke warm, bland and we're missing a roll. I had to call back and have them deliver another one, which took about 30 more minutes to be delivered. AND they charge me for it even though it was their mistake. 

In the past they've forgotten chopsticks and essentials. 

I'm done with you, Panda Wok. It is not hard to do your jobs. Clearly you just hired the wrong people to accurately take orders and deliver food to an address. Just because you're the only business in Lakewood offering this service does not give you an excuse to be shitty at it."}
{"text":"Really decent Chinese takeout/delivery and sushi. The food is consistently good and you get a ton of it! We always, always have leftovers. You really can't tell from the outside of the restaurant, but the inside is actually very nice and good for dining in. However, this place tends to get very busy (for takeout) & wait times can be over an hour for your food. There have been several times that I have arrived to pick up my order and have had to wait longer for it."}
{"text":"I was a teency bit excited to see the Open sign lit back up when I drove past a few weeks ago. They'd been closed for a long, long time. Too long. 

I've only ever had delivery from here, but I plan to actually go in one day. Really. I do. Just... I like delivery. And they're fast, good, and inexpensive. I use the word inexpensive on purpose - because cheap Chinese delivery conjures images of gross things. Everything I've ever gotten from them has been solidly good, if not great. 

Panda Wok is really your typical Americanized Chinese food - the standard fare is all here, and they don't do anything special to make it feel \"authentic\" -- but I'll be honest here and admit sometimes I want the Americanized version of stuff. It's kind of like comfort food. And that they do well. 

The Singapore noodles are hands down my favorite - even if they don't always get the spicy request quite right (sometimes it's too spicy, sometimes not spicy enough). The meat (pork, chicken, and shrimp) is always good and fresh - some other reviewers have said otherwise, but I can tell you that I've never had any complaint about low quality meat in any of my orders... and I've ordered from there more than I should probably admit. The fried rice isn't loaded with frozen peas and carrots (a personal nitpick of mine, but makes a huge difference) and the egg drop soup isn't too thick with cornstarch. 

The delivery is always super fast -- they always tell me 45 min or more - but it's never been more than 30. And the food is sometimes still too hot to eat right away. Granted, I only live a mile away, but still, it impresses me. 

Welcome back Panda Wok, even if my waistline suffers my enthusiasm."}
{"text":"Very good sushi. I usually grab Sushi across town. Think I found my new spot. The staff answering the phone for my pick up order was rude, but the nice man who rang me out when I got there made up for it. The Samurai roll is awesome."}
{"text":"The inside was quite clean and nice ambiance and the service was quite delightful the food was pretty amazing the Singapore noodles were a bit salty but they were still delish"}
{"text":"Good... Unless they screw up your order. We've gotten take out from here on and off for the last 3 years. Some items are good. We do not recommend the sushi. Order the black pepper chicken or Shrimp Subgum chow mein. For an additional charge, you can upgrade to shrimp or beef or chicken fried rice. That's the way to go. Their veggies are super fresh.

Update on my previous review on the service. Finally spoke to a manager and was able to get things resolved."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time recently. Decided to dine in. My son ordered the shrimp lo mein and I ordered the mandarin chicken. Both were very tastey. Inside was very clean and tasteful. Outside of the building is very deceiving of the inside. I plan on going back as my go to Chinese place."}
{"text":"I've been to Panda Wok many times over the past few years, both to dine in and to take out.  It is definitely a 'better' Chinese-American restaurant, and is close to greatness in many ways.

GREAT:
Very clean, super nice and helpful staff, quality ingredients, well-prepared and tasty recipes, generous portions, house-made condiments, sushi!  I really like their sushi, always as fresh as can be and with wonderful flavors, better than much I have had at fancier Japanese restaurants.  My favorite is the Panda roll.  I think that the commitment to fresh and high quality ingredients that sushi requires benefits the entire menu.  Seafood dishes are excellent; chicken and beef are top quality, too.  Favorite dishes are General Tso's chicken and spicy salty chili squid, but sadly I try to eat healthier most of the time, so regular go-tos are chicken with black bean sauce and shrimp with pea pods.

NOT SO GREAT:
I was originally going to rate 5 stars because I love Panda Wok, but upon reflection there are several menu items I avoid because they are inexplicably mediocre.  These are the wonton soup, dumplings, egg rolls, and fried rice.  Frankly, I get better at takeout places that otherwise are a couple rungs down the ladder from Panda Wok.

In conclusion, I consider Panda Wok a 'best of Lakewood' restaurant, and I always look forward to going there.  For consciousness-raising, mind-blowing, peak-experience Chinese food I go down to Payne Avenue, but Panda Wok has its place and I'm glad that it's close to me!"}
{"text":"Rangoon's empty. Sweet and sour pork had tiny chunks of meat but were the size of an egg with all the breading. How this is 4 stars is bananas."}
{"text":"A little gem hidden behind an unassuming storefront, Panda Wok will now be my go-to for Chinese and sushi in Lakewood. We dined in and had the pot stickers, miso soup, spring roll, veggie fried rice, fried squid, and dragon roll and everything was amazing. The decor was very nice and reminded me of upscale hibachi restaurants I have been to. I will surely stop eating from the greasy spoon Chinese competitors in the Lakewood area, I've found the best spot!"}
{"text":"Always great food whenever I order!  Love that I can walk here and everyone is so friendly.  Beef Szechwan is awesome, shrimp lo mein and honey chicken are some recent finds.  Order the spicy salty shrimp for a real treat!  Thanks Panda Wok!"}
{"text":"I visit here at Least once a week for Their Sushi! Since I've moved to the Westside it's the only Place I've found with Good Sushi! The Chef is excellent extremely knowledgable and professional and the staff is Excellent! One day I will actually get around to trying their other food as I've heard Their Chinese is excellent as well!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chili peppers squid!! Excellent!!!! Will definitely order again!! Not over cooked...very fresh and lightly bartered....very flavorful! Someone mentioned is was like crack...lol most definitely!!! Very addicting and I need it now!!! My first dish from here and need to order this every time!!"}
{"text":"Unexpected Diamond in the rough! Dinner was amazing and service was spectacular. Owner even came to see how everything was when she found out we were first timers. Will be returning very soon"}
{"text":"To start, this is by far the cleanist and most updated Chinese restaurant I've ever dined at.  Got the szechuan chicken lunch combo that came with fried rice and an egg roll.  Rice was good, egg roll was good, but the chicken had entirely to much sauce on it that gave it the consistency of a stew.  Server was great, food came out pretty quick, just wished I liked it more."}
{"text":"So, I come here for the sushi, and I pretty much always order the same thing. I've probably been here at least 50 times now in the last year, which is saying something because I don't go anywhere else NEARLY as often as I go to Panda Wok. I feel like their rolls are genorously sized compared to every other place I've had sushi from. It always tastes fresh and delicious, and sometimes I ask them to substitute cucumber for green onion in my Philadelphia roll and they're cool about it. The only other things I've tried are fried rice and vegetable lo mein, both of which were quite tasty. Especially the lo mein. 

The service is also great. The staff is really friendly, and will always talk to me when I go in to pick up my order. Actually I go there often enough that they sorta know me, which is nice. :-)

Basically, Panda Wok is great and you should try it out if you haven't."}
{"text":"Best general tsos I've found in the area ... Every thing else I've had is really good.  Wings are huge and a great deal on the appetizer menu .  Wait for it  ..........THEY DELIVER SUSHI!!! That's right Delish melt in your mouth sushi delivered to your door! Not sure if his has changed but the sushi chef (yes there is only one) doesnt work on Mondays ... I get he needs time off ... Just frustrating as a consumer to find that out hard way.  Place looks suspect ok exterior but is super nice inside."}
{"text":"So happy they re-opened, love the new décor and atmosphere, food is just as good as ever.  Great food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This hidden spot was amazing!! 5 star service- 5 star food. Reasonable $$$ and the Rolls were pure art. It is in a small lil hidden tiny older mini  mini mall area. Blink and you'll miss it- but don't because its so good!! You def want to check this place out! I was stuffed and so happy with everything!"}
{"text":"I only have ordered take-out, and I literally get the exact same thing every single time, but this place never disappoints! The Shrimp Pad Thai is amazing, it's $11.95 and the serving gives me multiple meals. I mean it could practically feed a whole family.
A lot of their dishes they let you control the spiciness. I always go for the mild which isn't spicy at all."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and I was thinking about just going with King Wah but I really didn't want to drive into Rocky River.  I'm glad I decided to orde.  The wonton soup was good, can't really mess that up, and the general tso chicken was pretty damn good.  Most places have a small piece of chicken covered in a pound of breading but this was nice whole chunks of chicken in a light breading.  The sauce was flavorful but not spicy enough, the gentleman said medium may be too spicy so I opted for mild.  I can handle spicy so next time we will probably do the medium! In all it was good food and don't let the negative reviews prevent you from trying!"}
{"text":"My new go to place for not just Chinese food but for sushi as well!! Large portions and great presentation. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"When you see Panda Wok from the outside you think \"Am I sure I want to eat here? Am I going to get sick from this place? It looks a little sketchy.\" At least that was what I was thinking when my friend and I decided we needed sushi ASAP. Don't let the outside fool you! When you walk in it is super elaborately decorated and beautiful! The sushi was delicious. It's not the best you'll have around here, but it is up to par. The sushi chef is a very friendly and remembered that my friend and I loved salmon and would hook it up every time we came back!"}
{"text":"Delivery takes a long time. If you're ordering sushi, you better have some time to kill or order it about an hour before you think you may actually be hungry for it. Service while dining in has always been excellent. Food is typical but better than some other local Chinese places."}
{"text":"Underwhelming to say the least. We got General Tso's chicken, lo mein, and wonton soup, and it was all pretty basic. The lo mein was the best of the bunch with a really nice sweetness to it. The General Tso's chicken got soggy in the sauce and the breading was disappointing. The soup and fried rice we got were both standard, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"My goto for sushi weekly! Close to where I live and generous portions so I can get my fill!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was hesitant to come in because I read some reviews about service and I am pretty picky about service.

I walked in alone and the gal at the counter didn't even look up at me until I said hello. I asked if I could sit at the sushi bar , since it was just me, but we both agreed a table would be better.
she ended up being my waitress and was a delight. She checked on me several times, even gave me a recommendation of where to meet up with friends later. 

My sushi was FANTASTIC. I feel like I should make up a word to get your attention so you know how good this sushi is. I ordered the Rainbow roll, creamy Hotate (scallop), Spicy Tuna and Philadelphia. All were better than the places I normally get sushi from. Since this location is closest to my home, I imagine this will be my new go to spot.

Sushi is never cheap, but I thought the prices were very competitive. Especially considering there aren't a lot of options in Lakewood/ West Park, they could be charging more."}
{"text":"This is my favorite asian restaurant. Dan always provides superb service. The quality of the food is far above other Asian restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"Again, they have saved me. Nothing is better for what ails you than their egg drop soup. Panda Wok is the only delivery place that tells me they will be here in 45 minutes, and they get here in 20. Everything is good, and they will make anything, anyway you want it. I feel better already."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite chinese take out on the west side of cleveland and they have a good selection of sushi since it was remodeled a couple years back. When trying to cure a Sunday hang over, I normal go with the General Tso or house lo mein."}
{"text":"Panda wok is my favorite sushi spot! I always enjoy their food and their service is always spectacular! I will most definitely be returning"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great - love the bubbling water light wall behind the register, the fun golden luck toad, the fake star panel in the ceiling, the glass bamboo panels, the koi tank. 

We ordered:

-the spider roll - it was filled with crispy fresh crab and was tightly rolled and not overly sauced. Really nice.

- the panda roll - loved the variety of fish and the spicy sauces, though the amount of sauce was a bit excessive. Great flavor and would get again

- the chicken & rice soup - same broth base as wonton soup, but with rice and lots of tender chicken. 

-wonton soup - good flavor 

- Pork Lo Mein - ok, nothing that stands out from others. Pork was thankfully not overly chewy.

All-in-all very solid Chinese food but a little pricier than competition in the area. Look forward to trying a few more rolls, but it's not knocking my regular place off its championship stool."}
{"text":"Got takeout from this place a couple nights ago. The potstickers were fried which I wasn't expecting but were tasty. The Crab Salad roll is a decent size and tasted pretty fresh. I also got a small hot and sour soup that tasted pretty standard. Overall I'm definitely interested in trying more from this place."}
