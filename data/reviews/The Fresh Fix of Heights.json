{"text":"Tried 3 items from the food menu and two smoothies. My whole family was pleased. Smoothies seemed a bit pricey but food was reasonable."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to update this review with a negative incident.  I ordered the chickpea salad sandwich and when I got home I noticed it had romaine lettuce.  There was recently a NATIONWIDE RECALL on lettuce!  When I called to ask if I could bring my sandwich back I was rudely told \"no\", and the romaine lettuce was listed on the menu.  When I asked her if she knew about the recall from the CDC she had no idea what I was talking about.  How does a restaurant not know about nationwide food recalls?    When I asked to speak with the manager, she told me she  as the co-owner.  The rudeness is one thing, but compromising a customers health is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Had the Madonna mango smoothie ...sooo good!"}
{"text":"OMG LETTUCE IM GONNA DIE!  Never eaten here but the only review cant be from some person who loves the food but is scared of lettuce."}
