{"text":"I normally don't review anything but I had the displeasure of coming to this restaurant today.  I waited 15 minutes in line before being able to order then waited another 30 minutes to get a chicken cutlet.  On top of that, the cashier was rude over something stupid like a bottle of water I ordered.  I told her I'll take the bottle of water from the fridge and she kept asking me if I wanted cold or warm water.  When I repeated I'll take it from the fridge, she starts giving me attitude.  Never coming back to his place and would give this place negative stars if I could.  Terrible."}
{"text":"I gave this place a few tries but the chicken always tastes dry and bland. One time the frier was broken or something so not all menu items were available. Not that great imo"}
{"text":"The chicken is good. It's not greasy for me, because fried chicken is meant to be that. Prefer the crispy one to original.

Waiting time is really annoying. You have to wait like 20min after you order even there's no line ahead."}
{"text":"Had the original recipe one ytd and i finally got why people line up for this. The chicken was so amazing with the crispy flour ( and even though they just season it with salt and peper ). The flour still remained crispy after such a long time! Definitely come back"}
{"text":"I dragged some friends here last, last Sat, originally to just check out how busy the place was, since we were close by. Then we saw the people eating the chicken through the windows. It looked so good! So we ended up lining up as well. The place looked really crowded, but everyone in the line on the left side were waiting to pick-up their food. The line on the right side was the order line, which was a lot shorter. 

We started lining up to order around 5:30pm. It took us almost 10 mins to get through the order line and order. All that was available when we were there, were the Original Large Fried Chicken and the drinks. It was suppose to be a snack for us, so the 4 of us split 2 orders of the Original Large Fried Chicken ($9.99 each). There were 3 flavours and 4 spice levels to choose from, we went with one Pepper Salt and the other one Less Spicy. It came with 2 free soft drinks. All that was left by that point was Diet Coke, so we took 2. Then we waited for our order for a bit over 30 mins, getting our chicken around 6:20pm. It was really hot and stuffy in there with so many people crammed together.

They have a limited amount of chicken they sell everyday. So at around 6pm I saw them put a hand-written sign outside saying they were sold out for the day. Guess we were lucky, we got there just before they sold out. There were still a few people that didn't see the sign though, and walked in only to be turned away. 

The chicken did taste pretty good. Really juicy considering they were chicken breasts. The bags the chicken came in didn't say which flavour which chicken was though, I think. Or we were so eager to eat, we dived right in without noticing. But I think it might have been the Less Spicy we all liked more. One of them definitely had more flavour than the other.  It's worth a try but not worth such a long wait. Its also a little on the expensive side, considering its just one large piece of chicken. 

In all honesty, them serving it in a bag and claiming no cutting service to preserve the juiciness of the chicken is a little gimmicky. Had that large chicken been served on a plate at a restaurant, I don't think it would have received such hype. I might try them again when the full menu is out, if there isn't such a long wait. Their Fried King Oyster Mushroom does look interesting (I love mushrooms!).

On a side note, my sister went after work on a Wed. And there were almost no line to order and she waited about 15mins to pick-up her food. So avoid going on weekends if you don't want the extra long line-up."}
{"text":"Tastes just like fried chicken at Taipei Shilin night market. However,  be prepared to wait 15 - 20 mins AFTER you've paid for your order. 

The original pepper salt has a bit of five spice in it."}
{"text":"One of the best finds ever!!  Absolutely amazing food and a very friendly and inviting atmosphere.

Close your eyes point one of meal on menu and choose,you won't be disappointed. Anything you choose, you will find here with great quality and good service.

The customers in there were also extremely friendly and we had a really good time laughing and chatting away.  It was a fantastic food place ! Definitely going back..."}
{"text":"$9.99 for a piece of fried chicken and lining up like a lamb to a slaughter house? No thanks. Banh Mi Boys just next door serving up delicious fried chicken pao for $4. You have left over money for their taco squid, five spice pork belly pao or kim chee fries all fresh and delicious. The owner of Hot Star must be thinking Torontonians are walking money tree. Time and money are equally expensive not something I'm willing to waste on street food being hailed from Taipei Shinlin Night Market. It's not art or some rare collectables. Recipes available in abundance on the internet."}
{"text":"Super juicy and crispy XXL fried chicken! No complaint, extremely satisfied with the food and the drink. Only wish they add more seatings."}
{"text":"Tasty chicken. Large portion. Good fries. And the passion fruit drink was really refreshing"}
{"text":"I wanted to give Hot Star 3/5 because the wait is tough, but honestly the chicken is delicious. I'm certain they pour honey or maple syrup on it or something... Very sweet, juicy, HOT, and the spice is nice also. (Medium )

The wait is painful, the combo drink is over priced. Go in for the 10$ chicken and bounce!! Worth trying forsure though"}
{"text":"Great example of a 3-star lunch IMHO. It's a massive piece of juicy fried chicken, no one is denying that, and sometimes that's exactly what you need, but other times you're like... man, my body deserves better than this. The spicy sauce is like literally emptying a whole pack of instant ramen flavoring (complete with mouth tingling MSG), so if you're a normal human you're probably going to need a drink. Any drink will do, so I'd suggest skipping the passion fruit soda, what I got, since it costs like $4+. As far as salty and meaty indulgences go, I would suggest anyone to shop around the Y+D area for some other tasty treats. Cool to try once though."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Chicken was a bit dry but flavour was good. The service was not so good and the person serving me seemed super bored. There are better Taiwanese style chicken to be found elsewhere."}
{"text":"The cheese fried chicken was absolutely fantastic!  It was crispy and juicy without being greasy - a feat considering it's deep fried chicken with cheese in it!  The seasoning was really tasty.  

Be prepared to wait though.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it takes about 20 minutes to get your order.  Totally worth it though!  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I don't know if I am the best person to review this place, as I didn't really order any food for myself.  A group of us popped in here after eating dinner, AND having tea and dessert, so there wasn't any room in my belly to really indulge in some Hot Star Fried Chicken.  I admit, I was curious though and did have a taste of the chicken popcorn.  Can't say I was overly impressed with the flavour, or the overall experience to return here again.  The chicken comes with the bones in, so you have to eat around the bone while on the go.  In our group 3 people decided to split one, but there are signs everywhere saying there is no knives available, and they won't cut it for you.  The 3 ended up trying to split it with plastic forks, which went terribly, as expected.  The fried chicken was greasy, and not overly flavourful.  However, just because it's not my cup of tea, doesn't mean that this place won't be wildly successful."}
{"text":"Anything fried is always good so I had great expectations for this place. And yes, the original large was succulent and tasty while the crispy large was tender and well seasoned as well.will definitely come back tomorrow! Hahaha!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place today and decided to check it out as I love Taiwanese style fried chicken. When I got there, I didn't see any lineup outside, but boy was the line up inside so full. You can have a good 15-20 people lining up inside to purchase their meals. On the left side of the line, I saw more customers lining up to pick up their chicken after they have made their purchase.

I waited for about 25 minutes to get in and out the door with my order, didn't think it was too bad (I really had to get this chicken). I got the combo 1 original spicy with the passion fruit soda. They didn't have french fries available so I couldn't get the second combo that comes wth fries. It was around $15 after tax, which I thought was quite pricey for just one big piece of chicken and a small drink. To my surprise, however, that huge piece of chicken was quite filling even on its own. The meat was very tender and the skin freshly fried to perfection. There's also a slight chewiness to every bite which I truly enjoyed. Taste wise, it was nothing out of the ordinary but still delicious regardless. I really enjoyed it, I just wished that I had the option to get popcorn chicken with rice, that would have been perfect. ;p"}
{"text":"A little overpriced. Given the price, would rather go to Popeyes for deep fried chicken. Good to try once a year."}
{"text":"Got the cheese fried chicken! The chicken was not dry, it was juicy, crispy and flavorful. The only two things were the cheese doesn't actually cover the entire piece of chicken. It ends after maybe three bites in. The wait, for a late Friday night, was about 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night. There was a small line up (about 6 people) in front of my party but it moved fast. Seems like there is no heating in there as the workers were all wearing jackets. Got the original large fried chicken w/ seaweed (powder on top lol) and just a regular one. They go for $9.99 + tax a pop and offer drinks + meals too.

Waited about 15 minutes to get the chicken which was freshly cut, breaded and fried. It was really good! Definitely will be back but not as often since it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"They only make 500 pieces of chicken per day, but keeps their store opened throughout the day telling people it's sold out. Not even 6pm and they are out of chicken. Why bother opening a store if you carry so little products?!"}
{"text":"I got the package at $18, BBQ chicken with fries and a drink., if you are looking for the crunchiness and flavour of the batter go with the original version., the BBQ sauce was diluting the crunchy batter that I was looking for. However was delicious, tender and tasty., the fries are just perfect, crispy and golden, and the soda (passion fruits) was sparkling and full of flavour, so refreshing! next time, I will order the original version with some extra pepper just to add more sparks to the flavour. Great service, perfect size, it works the price ! just watch out with the bone at the end of the bite."}
{"text":"????????????cashier?????"}
{"text":"Tasty fried chicken OMG 
Crispy outside, juicy inside good stuff 
The popcorn chicken is a bit too salty 
The passion fruit soda is meh. 
For $5 , it's better to save it for a bbtea or sth else 
I'd say go for the special big fried chicken haha"}
{"text":"Hot-Star Large Fried Chicken was on point!

Chicken was fresh and well-seasoned (maybe on the salty side for some). The other items on their menu weren't for sale yet, kind of disappointing as I really wanted to try the fried king oyster mushroom.

I got there at 1145 and had to wait in line for 45 minutes, but well worth it. I always get the house original if I am trying something for the first time. Tasted some medium spicy as well but it wasn't as good.

Chicken was $9.99 with a \"free\" pop. Make sure only to buy one order. I am a big eater and was really full off the one chicken, it creeps up on you in a hurry!

Seating is limited but there are probably 5 tables and some stools. I ate mine on the go!"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I love the fried chicken here! Quantity of food wise, I would compare this to getting a lb of wings or a meal at popeyes so that you're not squeamish about the $10 price tag. You can combine the flavours so I did salt/pepper and spicy, twice now. There wasn't a lineup both times so that wasn't a factor though I'm not willing to line up ever."}
{"text":"Was out and about running errands and was craving fried chicken. Ordered the original large fried chicken (spicy) and fried fresh mushrooms all for the price of $16.93. Pricey yes but it hit the spot. The chicken breast was oh so hot (heat wise & spiciness) and oh so juicy. I think next time i would eat half now and save the other half for later. The mushrooms were battered and seasoned and fried like the chicken but maintained the freshness and tenderness of the mushrooms. Definitely would try this again."}
{"text":"This is the most delicious chicken I have ever eaten.

I went when it wasn't busy - so I didn't have to deal with long lines."}
{"text":"Came here at 9pm on a Sunday night. No lines! Woohoo. But the seating area was pretty full. 

Ordered original chicken with mild spice (9.99) as well as popcorn chicken (6.99)

Took about 10 minutes for us to get our order, but I'm assuming its because they make it fresh. However if there was a line up I can see how this may pose a problem. 

Chicken was good. Juicy and tender, although some of the juiciness was probably from the oil from the deepfryer. The popcorn chicken was just like any standard taiwanese popcorn chicken. 

Is it worth the hype? Meh. I think I would be equally satisfied with Popeye's."}
{"text":"This place is famous for the large pieces of fried chicken. They do not offer cutting the fried chicken into smaller piece because the large portion is the main selling point.

I tried the original salt and pepper fried chicken with the strawberry soda. The chicken meat was tender and very hot (temperature) so you must wait for it to cool down for at least 5-10min before eating it.

The batter of the chicken has a sticky layer and rather than being \"crunchy\" the batter is rather hard. The batter is also very very salty lol hence a drink to go with it is highly recommended.

Overall, it is interesting to try, but I won't go back again mainly cause I personally prefer crunchy fried chicken in good seasoning rather than hard batter overly salted fried chicken."}
{"text":"Food: 8.5/10
Atmosphere: 8.5/10 
Service: 8/10
Overall experience: 8.5/10

The chicken is really really good. It comes out piping hot and is seasoned extremely well. 

There are a few seats in the place if you want to stay. It's very casual, so you could also grab and go!"}
{"text":"It was ok, just a bone in chicken breast pounder flat.  Costco fries.  The custom drinks are interesting."}
{"text":"My fav place! The first time I had this was in Hong Kong and so happy they opened up here in Toronto. Same great taste here. It's a bit pricey but certainly worth it because it's so tasty! Limited seating and very busy during peak times like lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Must Try: Crispy Large Fried Chicken, Original Large Fried Chicken and Green Apple Yogurt & Blue Curacao Yogurt. 

Rating: (7/10) Food, (7/10) Service, (7/10) Value, (6/10) Ambience, (5/10) Presentation, (8/10) Cleanliness

My Experience:

Went to try it out from all the excitement my Taiwanese friends had. Ordered both the Original (maximum spicy) and the Crispy (original spicy), along with the Green Apply Yogurt, Blue Curacao Yogurt, Passion Fruit Soda and Strawberry Sunset. 

Overall, you can't go wrong with fried chicken, but it was generally underwhelming. I preferred the Crispy version over the original, as it had more texture, flavour and crunch. I would note that the portion is quite large, one full size chicken breast, with some bone at the end of the piece. 

The Green Apple Yogurt and the Blue Curacao Yogurt were great drinks that we added to the combo, the only downside was that it was mostly ice in the cup. I would NOT recommend the Strawberry Sunset, as it was not strawberry enough and oddly too carbonated for my liking. 

The presentation is the chicken inside a take out bag, and you basically hold the takeout bag to eat the chicken. A bit savage, but does the trick if you're out and about eating a quarter of a chicken. 

I would recommend those curious to try it out for themselves, it is in no way bad fried chicken, but was far from what I had expected it to be."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say these popcorn chicken are amazing but I do want some of these when I am having a couple of beer. 

I love bite sized finger food, so the popcorn chickens attracted my attention immediately. The batter is just the right thickness, crispy outside and the chicken inside are juicy. There's not much heavy seasoning to the chicken itself, but the spices dusted on top were full of flavor. I actually really liked their popcorn chicken, always craving some.

The drinks were quite pricy, nothing special about them. Will come back to try out the deep fried oyster shrooms and chickens.

Small store, there's always a line up here. The chickens are made on the spot that's why there's such long waiting."}
{"text":"Are these chickens really just the breasts, because they're kinda huge (ie: the size of two large pancakes side-by-side)? I suppose chickens could have their own bra sizing system too...

On that note, I give Hot Star a B.  Wait, maybe that's not how the measurement system works.  OK, OK, B- then on a regular grading scale.

It literally tastes like popcorn chicken in a flattened, single piece form.  I can see why people say it's a bit of a steep price, as it tastes like just plain popcorn chicken.  I ordered it in \"little spicy\" but it reminds me of togarashi.

Will do on a quick food pickup, but I can see why people have felt that the $10 doesn't go very far on what amounts to a piece of plain ol' chicken."}
{"text":"A great little fried chicken place that makes your paper bag of chicken goodness to order.  When I walked in, I was able to place my order quickly.  I had their large chicken combo, medium spicy, with a green apple drink.

Order came fast, and hot, with the chili powder sprinkled on top on one side.  Biting into it, the batter clung well to the chicken, which was also moist and meaty.  This is meant to be had in one hand, but I wasn't expecting that the chicken was bone in at the bottom of the bag.  Nonetheless, I ate around it, absorbing the batter goodness.

Highest quality fried chicken I've tasted at a fast food place.  Does not disappoint."}
{"text":"The first couple bites are amazing, but eating the whole thing gets tiring.  Not worth the price for its value.  I recommend sharing it as a snack, nothing more."}
{"text":"Extremely tender and juicy fried chicken, but pricey for JUST chicken. 

I always order the Original Large Fried Chicken with salt and pepper seasoning. This is a large flat piece of fried chicken that comes in a paper bag inside a plastic bag. The most recent trip to Hot Star, I also ordered fries to share. The chicken is so well seasoned and juicy. My boyfriend says it's the best fried chicken he's ever had and I would definitely say it's one of my top choices for fried chicken. It is definitely really greasy and fatty, with a bone typically at one end of the piece. The fries are also really good and crispy - a perfect middle between Popeyes fries and Costco fries.

There's a decent wait for your food to be prepared and it's pricey for just a piece of chicken. If you're craving really fatty fried foods, I would definitely recommend Hot Star!

Note: It's extremely hot when you first get it, so be careful!"}
{"text":"Visited Hot Star on a Sunday evening to try their famous original fried chicken cutlet. The ordering process was very fast since there were only a few people ahead of us. However, the time it took from placing the order (one original chicken cutlet) to getting our food was around 15 minutes. Looking at the kitchen operations, they do not have fried chicken sitting under a heat lamp like at Popeye's or KFC which contributed to the longer wait time as the frying process begins once the order is processed.

From a fried chicken perspective, I was quite pleased.  I enjoyed the crunch and tastiness of the breading along with the juicy chicken. We ordered \"little\" spicy which was just the right degree of spiciness. Factoring the food quality, wait time and price point, I would say eating here would be a nice place to try, but not a must try."}
{"text":"So delicious, such a good snack. but a bit pricey at almost $11 for an albeit giant chicken fillet."}
{"text":"Ordered an original large fried chicken and their popcorn chicken. Chicken is very moist and delicious! However it loses points for representation (you get the fried chicken in a bag) and there are no plastic knives for you to cut the chicken. Generally people would just bite to tear the chicken apart, which would mean limited sharing. It's a very messy session! As stated before there are no plates so essentially you would have to pour the ketchup on napkins. Overall very good chicken but expensive and messy."}
{"text":"Huge line, huge expectations....all for a katsu-like piece of $8 chicken. 
My co-workers dragged me here for the soft opening. I had no idea what it was but they were hyping it up so much that I was pretty excited. They have no spicy, medium spicy and spicy. I got spicy and it was very manageable. Not too hot but still with some kick. 3 stars because the chicken was aiiite but definitely not worth the line up and $8."}
{"text":"Went on opening day after work and got lucky the line wasn't out the door and we got a table. Unfortunately they ran out of popcorn chicken so we opted for the spicy big fried chicken. I was mildly surprised with how good the chicken tasted. A little inconvenient to eat (it's in a paper bag then a plastic bag) but if your boyfriend is with you, he can hold it and feed you (: 

What I didn't like was... people's drink kept on exploding (we had two incidents while there for 30 mins) because there was too much air in the bbt cup and they kept on shaking it (I know not the owners fault but just a heads up... literally). I also did not like the price - a fried chicken and drink for $15. Seriously. You opened up near a university, a prime location to make lots of money because students are probably looking for a quick snack to go but you decide to charge $10 just for chicken. If you forgot, university students are broke. Maybe you should print stamps cards to keep your customers returning."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was painfully slow, particularly for the traffic they get. They need to hire more or find a way to better manage their customers, because waiting a half hour for one piece of chicken is unacceptable, particularly when we were some of very few customers in the store."}
{"text":"I was so excited to learn that Canada has this store...as an authentic Taiwanese...this is a very famous snack back in Taiwan..this is a franchise originated from Taiwan...it is so GOOD!!...the fried chicken portion is huge bigger than my face....even it is a fried chicken...the technique they used made the chicken to tender and juicy..it is just so GOOD!!....I will definitely come back again..and for sure..the price is much more expensive than if i were to buy it in Taiwan..but it is worth it!! it cost about $10 Canadian currency  for one piece of chicken..it is HUGE thou...can be counted as a meal"}
{"text":"I feel like this is just one of those places where you try it just to see what the big deal is, but there aren't a lot of repeat customers. The chicken is huge and the seasoning is good, but as expected it is very oily and I feel bloated after eating it. I have a feeling I'll be coming again soon though since my boyfriend wants to try it out..."}
{"text":"Food 3/5 (60% of final grade)
They weren't joking when they said LARGE fried chicken. The chicken was so fresh and hot when I got it! It was yummy, like a giant slab of Taiwanese friend chicken! Although it was yummy, it was also very HEAVY being the giant slab of friend chicken that it is. It is literally the length of your head. Eat it as a artery-clogging meal by itself, because it's too oily to eat in its entirety in addition to a meal. 

Ambiance 2/5 (10% of final grade)
Simple at best, and it was so cramped that I barely had any space to stand, let alone walk or sit down. I couldn't even evaluate the cleanliness of the general facilities, because it was so cramped.

Service 2/5 (10% of final grade)
Minimal service. They take your order and call you when it's ready. No smiles, nothing. All the  young people who work here obviously have better things to do. No passion. Zilch.

Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)
Conflicted point. For a piece of chicken as big as that, I guess it was worth it. Then again...$12 for a (giant) piece of chicken... I ernno. 

Brownie Points 0/5 (10% of final grade)
Had to wait 15 minutes for my chicken. No brownie points when I have to wait 15 minutes for my chicken at a fast-food establishment. 

Final Grade = 49/100 = 2 Stars

TLDR:  You order, and eat as you walk away with conflicted feelings of both FRIED CHICKEN and $12 piece of chicken. Do it, just to brag that you've survived to tell the tale after ingesting a slab of chicken that big, but it's not really something I'd go back for. I still prefer its superior-superior-in-taste-but-inferior-in-size cousin from Papa Chang's, the famous Taiwanese popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"I just don't get it. As a lover of fried chicken, this was a disappointment. The folks are friendly, but the bone-in fried chicken slab in wax paper is a challenge to eat, and not in a good way. Also, the seasoning is just dry cayenne powder dusted on one side, as opposed to being in the batter. Fried chicken is done best in the US south, and I appreciate reinterpretation, but this was a miss. Seems like a taste of home for the Taiwanese kids though, as I was the only person who seemed disappointed."}
{"text":"Ten bucks for a big fat juicy fried Taiwanese chicken. So delish, what you waiting for??"}
{"text":"After hearing about this from blog TO, I decided to try this out! 

Upon entering during the busy lunch hour on Saturday, there was a lot of people in the store itself. There are two lines: a pick up line where you wait for the majority of the time and an order line. However, there wasn't a sign saying \"order here\" so I was a bit confused. 

After being confused, I headed to the order line and was surprised that the majority of their menu had a tag saying \"coming soon.\" They only had the large fried chicken for sale. After ordering that, I waited about 40 minutes in the pick up line to pick up my chicken. Everything was in order and the lady who handed out the orders checked every single order number before giving you your order.

The chicken was massive and it was steaming hot when I received it. After having my first bite, I was in a fried chicken food coma. It was delicious! The seasoning was perfect and the amount of spicy kick was pretty good (I ordered little spicy). 

If they have no space to sit in their store, I recommend you go to the Shop at Auras food court or even College Park food court to enjoy your chicken. 

Overall, the chicken was delicious and I definitely will come back during an off hour when they start serving their other food items."}
{"text":"Had this when I was in Taiwan and it was I think $3 bucks and it had a massive line but an army of staff which moved it super quick. The Toronto location I know I can't expect Taiwan prices but I felt it was overpriced and we had to wait a long time. It was overly salty in my opinion and I got just the regular one. They didn't have anything else to serve in terms of food but they had drinks. The one I got was meh. Try it to say you tried it or get that Instagram photo for your album :) but other than that I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"We got the original medium spicy. It was SO juicy and tender! Don't cut it with a knife, just eat it as you'd eat a sandwich so the juices stay inside! Warning: there's a bone inside on the lower part. Absolutely delicious, I'll come back."}
{"text":"I truly did not believe that Hot Star was going to be that great, but I went anyways just because my boyfriend really wanted to try it.

Let me just say, that I was 100% wrong. Hot Star chicken definitely lives up to the hype. We got the cheese filled chicken and the plum chicken. I don't love cheese filled foods but I have to say that the cheese filled chicken was juicy, flavourful, and has a perfect texture. It was not just a slab of unseasoned meat filled with cheese but rather even without the cheese the chicken could be a hit.

The plum chicken was absolutely delicious and similar to the fried chicken in Taiwan. My only issue with it is that it has a strong sweetener-like aftertaste which really won't leave your mouth.

Nonetheless, I will 100% be returning. I loved Hot Star and it is now one of my go to restaurants."}
{"text":"Chicken fried to order so it comes out sizzlin' hot--be careful! 

I got the salt and pepper original ($9.99). Indeed very crispy. The chicken is breast meat but amazingly moist. The chicken is so massive and since I wasn't particularly hungry, I couldn't finish it and I was getting tired of the taste. The batter came clean off the meat which is a fried chicken no-no. Be careful of the bone too (refer to huge diagram on the wall).

I would consider coming back with a friend to share, or get the popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"Location/Service:
This is on Yonge/Gerrard, prime location for a quick snack - especially for Ryerson students nearby or if you're close to work. This is more of a come and go place - so seating are limited and not relatively good for large groups.  

Service is a-ok - they are informative of the different menu selections and give any recommendations if you're lost on ordering.


Food:
I really like how it's freshly made and relatively fast; it's literally soarching hot when they hand it to you.  I had the original large fried chicken with medium spice.

You can choose spice levels and for someone who's not good with spicy things, it was a little spicy for me.

The chicken itself is very crisp without a lot of bones (actual meat!).  It's also not dry - which I like for any chicken-related dishes.  Portion is well enough to fit a good afternoon snack.  

A suggestion would be to maybe slice up the chicken into smaller pieces, which can make it a little easier if people want to eat it on the go or share it with other people.

But I would come back again to try other combos and one of their yogurt drinks!"}
{"text":"Having heard of this for the longest time, I finally tried it. The interior is very clean with white and light blue. Going at around 230 PM on a Saturday, it was busy as expected. There were 3 orders in front of me and the wait was 15 minutes. Be sure to grab a seat after ordering as there were no seats left (only a single one was and I look it). 

The chicken is HOT when you receive it so use caution. It is really large; bigger than your face. It's chicken breast, but it's not dry at all. It's actually pretty juicy and tender. I ordered the Hot Cheese Fried Chicken. It is as they market it to be, \"hot & cheesy\". I love melted cheese so this was perfect. The layer on the top is the crispy and flaky.

I also tried their Passion Fruit Soda as I am a fan of passion fruit anything. It's pretty refreshing and not too sweet. They have a regular and a large option. This goes great with the fried chicken as it is a bit oily. 

The cashier was the only person working outside the kitchen and she was friendly. If you're a fried chicken lover, this is the place for you. 

Be sure you're not in a rush as there is a bit of a wait but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"As each bite goes on you progressively regret it more and more.

From a flavour perspective it was well seasoned and tasty. Just way too fatty and oily (I mean what was I expecting). Also if you want to share their plastic cutlery is not up to the job."}
{"text":"happened to walk by during a late lunch because another place close by was closed. i read that there were long waits during lunch..luckily by the time i went, there was only one other person paying in front of me. i decided against the large chicken and got popcorn chicken instead for $6.99 plus tax. ordered it lightly spicy and the bag of nuggets came piping hot and fresh. the spice level was perfect and i was extremely happy with my order. definitely tastier than the ones at close by bubble tea shops who serve taiwanese popcorn chicken"}
{"text":"Taste just like Taiwan, its very Authentic, after having a bite I felt like I am back to Taiwan. This is the as close as you can get of what Taiwanese food would taste like. Don't order the drink though, just try the chicken."}
{"text":"Hot Star originated from a Taiwanese snackbar that became famous for it's fried chicken. 
It's good... but for $10, I'd rather get myself a nice piece of Popeyes or visit Kanpai. 

Hotstar's chicken is very crunchy and juicy, but that's because it's thin and it's mostly fried batter. Since the whole piece of chicken is compressed, there's not much chicken meat until you hit the middle of the chicken where there's also a lot of bones. People say it's a big piece... but of course it is. Imagine compressing a chicken so that it becomes a flat shape. Imagine how large that should be. Hotstar gets too much credit for being \"large portioned\". It really isn't when you think about it. 

Flavour wise... it's not bad. We picked the pepper salt flavour. Reminded me of the Taiwanese salt flavour that is found in popcorn chicken. You can choose between pepper salt, spicy and seaweed. 

The lineups at Hot Star can be confusing. There's two lines. One for pickup, and one for ordering. But since the place can get really busy, it's not really clear where each lineup begins. 

Overall, I wouldn't come back. Once is enough just to say that I've tried it. For $10, there's much better snack options in the area and it wasn't really tasty enough for me to come back. 
Can't recommend it."}
{"text":"My only regret is that I didn't eat here a second time.

I've been to Asia a number of times and whenever I can, I eat the hell out of some hot star chicken.

This is hands down the best thing to happen to chicken since Colonel Sanders.

This is a small fast food style shop but don't let the set up fool you, the fried chicken patties here are nothing less than 3 Michelin stars. The thick juicy pieces of chicken are brined for 24 hours in a vat of unicorn tears and then aggressively seasoned with fairy dust before being fried until they form a perfect golden shell locking in all that delicious chicken essence. It tastes like a chicken patty breaded in spicy potato chips.

They hand it to you in a paper bag that you can use to eat on the go. Beware, however, of the scalding juices that lie just beneath the crunchy exterior. 

I opted for the original flavor but I saw many others get one that was filled with cheese. Alas, I didn't have enough time to make a return trip here before I left the city.

The only thing I wish would have been better is the speed of service. They're a pretty busy business but there are only 2 employees. One in the front and another in the kitchen. Food was a bit slow to come out and the front lady seemed somewhat overwhelmed.

Now if only they would open one of these in NYC."}
{"text":"This is an addition to the food chain fads that are making an impact here. Though its not to the level of Uncle Tetsu cheese cakes this place was ridiculously busy the first time I passed by and was reasonably busy at an off peak hour when I visited.
The lineups are confusing at first as some people were lined up for pick up and one doesn't know where to go initially. I gave the menu a quick look and went for the big chicken and ordered it medium hot. Then the wait began. I had roughly 12 people ahead of me so the wait was around 15 min (they do fry to order) so the wait time is expected. The dinning in option is not inviting to say the least and I can imagine it being unbearable when its crowded. Anyway on to the main attraction here is the verdict
The batter is a bit on the thick side but the chicken is fried well and thankfully not overcooked. One can mistake it for a Schnitzel but this one has bones on the tail end of the chicken so do tread carefully. The spice itself didn't pack much heat. Certainly better than the chain offerings but with Kaiju just around the corner at the same if not less price range I can't recommend it over Kaiju.
3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"No wait at all to order when we came around 630pm on a Tuesday. There were 2 or 3 people waiting for chicken in front of us but we didn't wait long. There were also a few available tables. So maybe the hype has died down already?

Got the original (spicy). It does taste good and is quite juicy for chicken breast. However I do think that it's overpriced. I prefer KooKoo in Mississauga where you get a lot more for the money (and which tastes quite comparable, but maybe not as juicy). 

If I had to wait 30+min, I'd probably give 2 stars."}
{"text":"Saw this while travelling in HK & Taiwan, but didn't try it until now.

The actual restaurant is nice enough. The design of the place is modern and is mostly white with blue accents. It's clean and seats roughly 12 people comfortably, so don't expect to be sitting when you get there.

Firstly, you will wait 10-15 minutes for the chicken because it is made to order. Don't expect your order to come fast unless you stick to just a drink. There is only one cash register, and almost always a line regardless of how busy it is for exactly that reason. I came on a Saturday night and only had to wait about 2 minutes before I could order.

I ordered a large original chicken, little spice, with fries and a green apple yogurt drink coming out to around $17 after taxes. I felt the price was a little high, but saved judgment for the actual food.

The chicken is, as many other reviewers have mentioned, a flattened bone-in chicken breast. This is then heavily battered, breaded, fried and powdered with your desired amount of spice. The result is similar to a katsu or schnitzel with bones. The chicken was juicy and flavourful, and the batter was tasty and crispy. However, the thick batter quickly separates from the chicken after a few bites and you start realizing the batter is actually fairly bready. I personally felt it was from soaking up the juice from the chicken, my wife felt it was because it was not fried well. The former could have been fixed if they had just drained the chicken much more before frying it, the latter by getting better kitchen staff.
Remember: There are bones at the bottom of the chicken as they do use a bone-in breast. I didn't mind them, but keep in mind you will have to avoid a few ribs, some of the breast bone, and a drumette. 

The fries were just straightforward packaged fries, but they were fried well. Crispy, hot, and the portion was fairly large.

The green apple yogurt drink was the same as you'd get from any bubble tea spot. It was okay, but I would personally walk north one block to Chatime to save 2-3 dollars.

Overall, I don't think this is a place worth visiting twice. If you do plan to try this place, stick with just the chicken and keep your expectations low."}
{"text":"This one has been on my list of places to try for quite a while, and we finally got to it after trying to go to halal guys but seeing that the line was too long. 

We had the original fried chicken and the crispy fried chicken with seaweed flavouring. I liked both but preferred the crispy fried chicken. The batter was a hit thinner and it was way more crispier than original, as expected. The seaweed flavour was a nice touch but was a little overpowering."}
{"text":"As a Taiwanese who lives in Toronto, this is probably one of those nostalgic foods whenever I feel the craving for Taiwanese food. The taste and the size of the product are about 90% identical to the first store in Taiwan, in which I am very pleased with it everytime I get it. However, I do have to take one star off based on the service speed, and the price.The service speed is nothing compared to any branches in Taiwan. In here, it takes about 12-15minutes avg, 5-7min if lucky. Whereas in Taiwan takes about 2 minutes on each order. And ofc, despite the fact the fried chicken is delicious, the price isn't super friendly.  9.99 plus tax on the fried chicken and 12.99 for the ones with cheese. But, can't complain about it, this is Canada, everything is supposed to be more expensive anyway. Overall, the dining experience has been tremendous, would come back again."}
{"text":"If you're ever craving chicken , just go here. Friendly staff and right on yonge. I've been here a few times now and it's probably one of the best places that serves fried chicken that I've been to. The seasoning is amazing. But be sure to grab napkins."}
{"text":"Second day, and there's a huge lineup with many foreign Asian students attending Ryerson. Got the extra spicy fried chicken for $10+tax. It came with a free pop, but that's a promo and who knows how long that'll last. Some people claim it's 30cm long, but I measured it and it's about 23cm, or 9 inches.

The taste was standard Taiwanese-style fried chicken. Many shops are able to replicate this taste, so it's not very special. I'd have to describe it as very salty with a hint of black pepper. However, those shops cook popcorn chicken, not a huge chicken breast cutlet. The cutlet isn't boneless; the lower half contains a section of the rib.

It's a good novelty food, but for $10 you can get at least a 4-piece dinner at KFC/Popeye's, or a 5-piece dinner at Chick'n Joy, my personal favorite. An apt comparison would be against KFC's Double Down, and this single cutlet definitely is larger than both Double Down patties combined."}
{"text":"pretty good fried chicken on the go.
I ordered the crispy fried chicken medium spicy level
and fries.

$8.99 plus tax (11.99) The chicken was good , upon ordering it took 7 minutes like advertised. the chicken was really fresh and juicy no complains there. The bone was still in aswell. The batter was nice and crispy not too greasy or dry just right. The only thing I was not too fond of is that the spice component is not mixed into the batter, it is just a powder they put on top, i would prefer to have it mixed into the batter (seems like cayenne pepper) it was burning my lips just a bit. overall the chicken is worth trying. 
The fries $2.99 were okay aswell texture and look was like costco fries with just a bit more flavouring. 
They have a nice clean place and clear simple menu, no specials they have combos and specialty drinks."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews, but after eating this extremely overpriced and awfully tasting chicken I had to. First of all, if you're going to try it regardless of my review, smell it before you eat it and tell me it doesn't smell absolutely disgusting. After getting over the awful smell, I tried to enjoy it, I really did, especially after paying $30 for 2 pieces of chicken and some fries. But I couldn't enjoy it, the chicken seasoning tastes really gross to be 100% honest, I'd rather eat KFC or Popeyes for less than half the price. Really don't recommend. I was excited after seeing it on BlogTO. Wont be trusting them again... Don't recommend"}
{"text":"Stopped by with a group of friends, and got the Original Large Fried Chicken and Popcorn chicken to share. It's a bit of a bizarre concept to me - eating a large, flattened, fried piece of bone-in chicken breast that is served in a takeout paper bag like it was a patty or something. Also, warning, there are no knives in this place so sharing the fried chicken might prove to be a bit of a challenge. I'm not the biggest fan of fried chicken, so this didn't really appeal to me, but I did want to check out what all the hype was about.  The chicken is about $10 so a bit much unless you really love this particular style of fried chicken."}
{"text":"Ever had a fat, large, juicy piece of chicken that you wish you could eat another but couldn't cause you were so full? Probably Popeyes right?... but I mean.. in this case, it's HOT STAARRR!!

Late review and unsure if there are still lineups but it was so worth it. Walked over there during my lunch hour and brought it back to my office - delicious, savoury, yummy... I don't know if I can think of any other words. It was very filling and for about $10, it's worth the treat to yourself...Or, think of it as protein. Thats all.

I'm probably going to have to indulge in another one once the weather stables............COMING BACK FOR YOU , YOU PIECE OF CHICKEN!!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing, I've been to several Hot Star locations in Taiwan and this one unfortunately falls short.  The taste is pretty much the same, but the Toronto location has too much breading compared to meat ratio and the breading was a bit soggy in a few spots.  It's $10 for a piece of flattened chicken breast which is a bit pricey.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10 -- Value: 6/10 -- Service: 7/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 7/10

$15 for a piece of fried chicken and a drink is not worth it in my opinion. 

First of all, you can only order chicken and drinks. Don't be confused by their menus. Some items say \"Coming Soon\", some don't, but you still can't order any food items other than the chicken. I don't know what the timeline for the other things is. 

SEAWEED

is a green powder. It tastes like seaweed and is nice in addition to the salt and pepper (S&P). I tried a bit of my friend's regular S&P and it was a little salty just on its own. There are a few seasoning options, but I didn't feel like they were obviously enough displayed. It was like fine print under the chicken. I only remember S&P, seaweed, and maybe spicy although I'm not sure about that last one. It's also unclear if you can have multiple because I asked for seaweed thinking I could only pick one, but my receipt said S&P and seaweed. Maybe S&P is the default.

CHICKEN

is hot and tastes pretty good, but I mean, it's just a giant piece of fried chicken. I was full with the chicken and drink. Full, but not stuffed.

DRINKS - WHAT IS YOGURT?

I feel like this is a question a lot of places need to answer. I had the green apple yogurt drink as part of the $15 combo and it tasted great. I love sour green apple. But I don't know what part of this was yogurt. Like a drop of yogurt? It was essentially a juice. But it tasted great though, albeit expensive. 

BEAT THE LUNCH RUSH BY 10 MINUTES

There wasn't a line at 11:50am, so we got to order immediately and while we ate in, people started to trickle in, but it didn't get unreasonably busy. The wait was mostly for the food preparation, which is under 10 minutes.

I might come back to try some of their other fried things, but as is, the chicken or even the chicken and drink combo seem really expensive."}
{"text":"I've never had a piece of chicken this big. Its huge, which to me justifies the price. You can have a very filling and delicious meal for a bit over 15 bucks. I had the chicken and their special mango soda drink which they make in house. The chicken, in case I didn't make it clear, is huge. Like the size of an infant's head. And it's sooooo good! I certainly prefer it to KFC. I got the regular salt and pepper flavor but they have a few other flavors: seaweed and something hot. 

I highly recommend this place if you're looking to try a new type of fried chicken or even if you're just hungry and are looking for food."}
{"text":"Great idea, and I hope it stays.  It's menu is simple with few items, but I think that's quite alright.  It's trying to not fall into the fried chicken restaurant stereotype as even the chicken is different - flavour and presentation-wise. .  

What I enjoyed is it was hot, juicy and crispy.  What I really enjoyed is the unique drink options as part of their combos.  I really liked the strawberry soda.  

What I didn't like:: the price; seemed above average considering the portion.  As well, at the time of my visit they did not have any additional flavours, but apparently they're coming.  In the meantime, enjoy your order of fried chicken in its natural, delicious form!"}
{"text":"The chicken here is fantastic. It tastes just like the one in Taiwan (except the one in Taiwan costs less than $2 CAD!)."}
{"text":"It was alright but I think I like the Korean style one better. Probably because i am used to the style. If you never tried it before, definitely worth trying. You may think it is overpriced but keep in mind that the chicken you get is huge!!!"}
{"text":"Can you say BEST CHICKEN EVER!? This place is an Asian chicken hut serving a variety of fried chicken. This is where you want to be for that friend chicken craving. Just pass kfc and go right here. Service is average and the place is super clean.  They also serve bubble tea."}
{"text":"Dry. Overpriced. Underwhelming. 

We ordered the original large fried chicken and popcorn chicken, both with the spicy option. 

The large fried chicken is made with breast meat. What happens when you deep fry a piece of breast that's cut ~1 cm thick? Dry. 

I see a lot of reviews raving about the flavour and seasoning. Although I tasted hints of Taiwanese fried chicken seasoning on the large fried chicken, it was overpowered by the thick and hard exterior shell... Gave my gf a headache on her first bite. Tasted like deep fried leather dipped in a Mr. Noodles seasoning pack. I had to smother it in ketchup to make it palatable, not to mention digestible.

There were about 10 people in the queue waiting for their order. 5 workers at the back. 3 taking orders. At least 2 idle. And it took 20 mins to fulfill our meal order. A clear bottleneck in the production line (probably related to inexperience), which might be forgiven in light of flavour or value... 

But $9.99 for a piece of fried leather? No thanks. We're heading to Popeyes down yonge for our fix next time."}
{"text":"Finally came here to see what the fuss was about. In consideration of the unhealthy nature of fried chicken, we decided to share one piece of originalchicken amongst ourselves.

Pros: chicken came out hot, meat was tender, and there were bones in so you know its real chicken and not pink goo

Cons: the skin was soggy in some places, the spcies were unevenly distributed, and the restuarant was dirty

After satisfying my curiousity, I think I will be okay not having Hot Star chicken in my life."}
{"text":"So after hearing so much about this place with the huge fried chicken, I finally went on my most recent trip to Toronto.  I'm glad that I tried it.  It was ok, but really greasy/oily so I don't know if I would go back.  

My husband and I shared a combo (a huge piece of fried chicken, fries and a soda for $15.99).  It would have been way too much food for me to have on my own, but it wasn't quite enough food for 2 people.  

We got the salt and pepper flavour with a little bit of spice.  It was really salty, slightly spicy, and very oily/greasy.  The piece of fried chicken was essentially an entire chicken breast flattened out with the bone in.  The boneless parts were ok, but the bony parts were difficult to eat. It came piping hot.  With some bites the breading actually separated from the chicken and all I got was a mouthful of breading.  Not only was the breading salty, but the chicken was salty too (like it was marinaded in salt).  However, the chicken was moist and tender.  

The fries were good though.  They were lightly battered and seasoned.  I love ketchup but I didn't even need ketchup for these fries!  

The passion fruit soda was good.  It wasn't too sweet and it tasted like passion fruit.  

It's kind of a fun concept and it's different than any fried chicken that I've ever had, so I'm glad I tried it, but I probably wouldn't again."}
{"text":"The chicken is delicious. 
Hot. Fresh. Moist. Marinated. Breaded and deep fried perfectly. 
But the price point is just too high. About a third too high. I'd pay 8$ max for it again. 

And certainly not worth any lineup. 
Once the novelty wears off just get yourself a bucket of fried chicken !"}
{"text":"Walked by this place because it was close to our hotel. Looked pretty good and there were people in there eating so we decided to try it. Got the crispy fried chicken with mild spice and it was delicious! Huge piece of chicken that you just bite into and eat your way through, Def tasted good and was juicy on the inside. Place wasn't too big and I can def see it getting busy. Quite a few people were getting theirs to go."}
{"text":"Yep, I finally succumbed to the peer pressure and tried this place out.

To quickly summarize for those who are skimming: the price is slightly on the upper end but the hype is definitely real.

Like most people, I've been deterred by the long lineups that this place has been notoriously known for ever since it opened up because standing outside in the cold just really isn't that appealing to me. But today when I went around 4pm, the lineup was considerably reasonable so it only took 5mins to get to the cashier. However, the real waiting came from the process of them freshly deep frying the chicken so that took around 30mins. 
THE CHICKEN WAS DELICIOUS. Without a doubt the best I've had in Toronto (though still subpar to the korean fried chicken I got overseas). The chicken was succulent, deep-fried in a crisp and flavourful batter, and sizzling hot when served fresh from the fryers. I can now speak to the appeal of this place and understand why it's received so much attention in the past two months. 
The price, however, I feel is still slightly on the upper end for a chicken cutlet. I mean, it's probably not a problem for most business men and women but considering it's across from Ryerson, it's not exactly student-budget friendly. So for my fellow students, I would recommend that you do give this place a try at least once. It's worth it."}
{"text":"I was in full tourist mode, finding places to eat that could compare to back home in California. I have been deprived of real food for about a year now because we currently reside in New York. THE STATE not the city. There's a lot more to New York than the city. And if I meant the city, I wouldn't really be complaining about the food now would I lol. 

Anyways, fried chicken. Honestly who DOESN'T love friend chicken?! That's obviously a rhetorical question. Because if you were a vegetarian, vegan, pescatarian and all the other non meat eating diets out there. You probably wouldn't be reading reviews for a chicken spot. Or maybe you would. Who know.

Taiwanese fried chicken has a particular flavor that I can't put my finger on. But you can smell It in the air and know it's Taiwanese chicken. We have this place called tapioca express. As I'm walking to the door, the smells escape from the crack. And that's exactly what It reminds me of. Tapioca express serves Taiwanese popcorn chicken. And it's something I've always eaten for like ever. So I was excited to come here! 

I ordered the original, spicy. Because I loveeee spice. It took about 10-15mins. But they're frying It to order. It is literally huge, so I understand the wait.  When It came out, It was so hot and crispy. That first bite. I almost cried because It tasted like home. Lol! The chicken was so moist and juicy! And It didnt have that \"oily\" taste like most fried chicken has. The flavor again is something that I can't explain. But I love It. I want to go back, and this time actually finish my chicken. I shared with my hubs. Cause we literally ate like 2 hours prior but when you're on vacation and you don't have this kind of food near your home. You have to take It all in! Even with sharing and partly because we were already half full. We didn't even finish the chicken we had, that's how big It was. Definitely worth the price imo."}
{"text":"They advertise Surprisingly Large Chicken - and it is. We tried the chicken with cheese filling (medium spicy) since we wanted the whole experience and we were not disappointed. The chicken is made to order and comes hot and fresh. It is as you might expect a huge deep fried piece of chicken stuffed with cheese - delicious! The dusted on hot pepper seasoning was not quite what we expected but it had a nice kick to it and became part of the experience. We will surely be back to try the other options. 

Be warned - this is not an 'everyday food', this is a 'sometimes food'. Govern yourselves accordingly."}
{"text":"It was OKAY at best I was lucky because when I went it wasn't busy but I still ended up waiting about 10-15 minutes for my chicken, the pick up area was more packed than the line. 

Overall the chicken tasted like Taiwanese popcorn chicken which they also serve. I do want to try the crispy and bbq chicken when it comes out. 

P.S if you're going to touch your face when your grease filled gloves in a OPEN KITCHEN, wash your face and change your gloves. I may be the only person who seen it but I know he saw me look at him."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of uncle tetsu in many ways. And that is NOT a compliment. 

The place is a logistical nightmare. Here's why:
-When you go in you see a line up and assume it's the line up to order, but it's the line up to pick up food. Everyone I saw come in stood in the wrong line until they were helped. 

-It appears that they have only 2 friers in the back, and considering the size of the chicken that theoretically means they can only cook 2 pieces at a time. This means unnecessarily long line ups. 

-Not enough seating. 

The food is disappointing. The chicken is nicely cooked, but the breading/skin situation is a mess. The breading layer doesn't adhere to the meat layer and just hangs off. This makes eating it awkward and messy. This problem wouldn't arise if they choose a more conventional shape for the chicken. 

In addition to the lacklustre seasoning, it really shows how the novelty of having a giant flap of chicken doesn't pay off. 

Much like uncle tetsu, it probably appeals more to the asian palate, because it's not nearly seasoned enough to fit the North American definition of fried chicken. And just like tetsu the line ups are horrendous. Don't fall for the hype. There are so many better things to do with your time."}
{"text":"Just got back from there, and I guess the hype is now over.  Was walking past it at 11:50am and there was no line at all.  I mean, I was able to walk right up to the counter to order.  I thought there must have been something wrong, or they'd already run out of chicken.  But nope.  Got right in and ordered.

It still took about 10 minutes to get the piece of chicken though.  So if you're in a hurry, you might have to take a pass.  The bottle neck seems to be people ordering bubble tea.  As they don't triage their orders (i.e. people not ordering bbt could just get their piece of chicken and then take off), instead they deal with one order at a time, with one cashier, and it looks like one person making bbt. 

Chicken was pretty good, but not sure if I'd regularly spend as much as I do on getting a whole roasted chicken.  At the end of the day, I'd still prefer Kanpai's TFC."}
{"text":"This is a piece of chicken breast (with bones), pounded thin and flat, and deep fried into a very, i mean VERY thick breading. The breading was well seasoned, and every crunch was addictive. What I mean is: upon the first few bites, I've decided that this chicken is not going to change my life. But yet I just can't stop eating it. Every bite leads to another bite. 

Do you like fried chicken? Do you like Chips? I'm asking because after the chicken was over and done with, I find myself daydreaming and wanting to eat Hot Star fried chicken again! I then realized it's essentially a combination of my two love: chicken, and chips. 

It wasn't good chicken but it was good breading, almost feels like junk food and not a meal. 
Think Swiss Chalet sauce VS the chicken. Or the KFC spices and chicken skin VS the actual chicken. 

The whole experience of lining up and encountering many weird patrons in the restaurant almost ensure that I won't visit again very soon."}
{"text":"The establishment itself is quite unique. They are known to serve taiwanese fried chicken...but it is not any type of ordinary chicken.. the size of the meat is as big as your face! When it first opened there were long lines up and they even sold out quite quickly but now that the hype is gone you can easily walk in and walk out in 10 minutes.  

The chicken itself is quite flavourful. You have the option of choosing it's spice level.. we made the mistake of choosing extra spicy and all that meant was adding extra hot chilli powder on top. That ruined the flavour of the chicken.. next time would just stick with original black pepper and salt flavouring.  We also tried their popcorn chicken and for 6$ you get an underwhelming amount of popcorn chicken. The bag was half filled but the flavour was so good that you wished they filled the bag actually 6 dollars worth! 

Will come back but definitely not a place where you want all the time."}
{"text":"The North York store of Hot Star Large Fried Chicken is located just south of the intersection of Yonge and Finch and next to Lim Ga Ne Korean Restaurant.  They have a few tables for dine-in but I gather that many of their customers actually order take-out -- it must be so convenient for those living in the nearby apartments to grab a quick afternoon or late-night snack here.

We ordered the Original Large Fried Chicken in Salt and Pepper seasoning.  We also ordered a serving of their Popcorn Chicken (my favourite) and a serving of their Fried King Oyster Mushrooms.

It did take about ten minutes for our order to be ready.  It's nice that they prepared it fresh, I guess.

The Original Large Fried Chicken cutlet wasn't as large as I remembered it to be when I had it in Hong Kong (and when I had it in Hong Kong, it was actually the smaller version of the Large size too).  K was also underwhelmed with the size too.  It was still crispy though when we ate it.  It was the same taste-wise as I remembered with the crispy battered skin falling away from the chicken breast meat, which was moist and very tender.  When I ate it in my hands, it almost felt like I was eating a chicken skin-chicken meat-chicken skin sandwich.  XD  I still enjoyed it though because the chicken meat was moist and tender.

Oh, when we got to the end part of the chicken, we realized that it wasn't a pure piece of chicken breast; there were actually bones!  They had squished the chicken so that you could see the rib cage and bones too.  This was definitely different from the pure chicken meat cutlet that I had had in Hong Kong.

The Popcorn Chicken serving cost $6.99 and for that price, I thought that there were very few pieces inside the paper packet. :/  Taste-wise, it was delicious.  The Popcorn Chicken morsels were crispy too and seasoned heavier than the large piece of fried chicken.  I really enjoyed this and the Popcorn Chicken was definitely to my liking.  )I get very particular about Popcorn Chicken. :))  But when it comes to the price, I can't see myself ordering this again for so few pieces.

The Fried King Oyster Mushrooms were $4.99 for one serving and also didn't contain that many pieces.  I really enjoyed the taste too!  The Fried King Oyster Mushrooms were cut into chunky pieces that weren't too battered but full of seasoning.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I love fried chicken and yes this is fried chicken but I really don't get it.  I mean yes I've had mountains of wings in my life and buckets, cutlets, katsu, nuggets, and popcorn and strips and just about every possible size and shape of fried chicken I thought there ever were... until I came here.

Hot Star Large Fried Chicken, yes that's their actual name.  Nothing is really lost in translation at this place it's just your typical carnival food looking piece of flattened fried chicken breast - bone in by the way.  Don't believe me?  Keep eating it and get to the end.

Like all fried things, this....\"thing\" is hot.  That's another issue - what the hell do I call this \"thing\"?  It's not a schnitzel, it's not a patty, it's a piece of real chicken breast that for having a surface to batter ratio to be actually higher for batter because there's more surface to cover being that the piece has been flattened.  While I didn't measure this thing I'd estimate it to be a good 10 inches long and about 5 inches wide. 

I ended up asking for an \"original\" medium spice.  The piece I received had visible spices on one side of the chicken.  It came in a big pocket paper bag and that bag was put into another plastic bag.  It's a big piece of battered deep fried chicken alright but it's just a single food item, not really a complete meal.  It's not that cheap either but it's relative to the fact that you're getting a large piece of white meat chicken I suppose.  

This \"thing\" costs 10 dollars.  To put it into perspective you can get a white meat quarter chicken dinner at Swiss Chalet for about 12 bucks.  You can get 3 pieces of fried chicken (various pieces) at Kanpai Snack Bar for 9 dollars.  You can get a 3 or 4 piece combo at Popeye's for about 10 bucks.  

To me this thing seems like a fad.  When they first opened up yes they had lines of people waiting but that's because the place is new.  How long will this last?  That is yet to be determined but having what equates to a single item for sale pretty much narrows that market and there is competition for fried chicken out there in the city.  I know because I'm still on a Korean Fried Chicken crusade to find good KFC in my city and the list just for Korean is long.  

So you want to share this large flattened piece of battered fried chicken breast?  Let it be known that they will NOT cut it for you, grovel as you may but policy is policy.  You will find yourself bringing your own knife or cutting utensil with you should you want to actually share your food with another.  These are intended for individuals and you pretty much have to buy your own or trust the people biting into your \"thing\".  This is not a food item meant to be shared I'm guessing...?

Being that it's in a bag inside of another bag they almost want you to take it out but there is seating here for about 20 or so but this food looks and feels like it's simply a food on the run.  We don't have laws about food being forbidden here on the TTC like Chicago so maybe you'll see people walking down the street or on a streetcar or subway eating this chickenized version of a \"Beaver Tail/Queues De Castor\".

While this Taiwanese chain discovers how Toronto is diverse and very open to new things they may soon learn that Toronto can also be fickle.  Hopefully for them their product will stand the test of time here in our city.  I don't know if it can."}
{"text":"We checked out this place after witnessing, first hand, the sheer number of people willing to wait in line and pay top price for a piece of freshly fried chicken. The promises of freshness and unique taste peaked my interest. I was so hoping to like this place. Sadly, I cannot get on board with the pace or the price of this place. The first annoyance of this place was the lack of clear outline of where to order and pick up, customers confusingly stood in line only to be told that it was not the ordering line. Placing the order was quick but pick up was glacially slow...food barely left the pick up window as workers stood around and chat. After what seemed like an eternity, we received our piece of chicken and drink. Admiringly, the chicken was good, crispily fried with a batter that was uniquely springy (for lack of a better description...possibly from the use of tapioca flour). The meat was tender , juicy, and well seasoned. The piece was large-about the size of a large palm (sharable if you're in a snacking mood-not when you are hungry). It was enjoyable enough. However, I do not think that the price justified what we got. The meal was about $16 for a piece of chicken and a large drink (nothing exquisitely memorable). On top of that, the time wasted lining up and waiting, plus the frustration of seeing the inefficiency unfolding in front of you would leave one feeling frustrated (especially when hunger is starting to grind your nerves...hangry as one may refer to). I was glad to have a try but until the price is more reasonable and the efficiency increase, I don't think I'd be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Came across a blogTO post couple days ago introducing this very new restaurant from Taiwan - Hot-Star Large Fried Chicken.  They claimed to be one of the street food that you must get at the Taipei's Shilin Night Market.  I was very curious on the taste and size of their chicken, and here I am on the third day of their soft opening.

Arrived at 10:50am, there was already a short lineup. I was the sixth person in line, so it wasn't that bad.  After taking a couple pictures outside and reading their poster menu, it was already 11am, and I couldn't wait to get in.  Little did I know, they were not ready for customers, we had to wait outside until 11:15am to get in.

After getting into the restaurant, the staff made us wait for another 10 minutes to start taking orders.  They did not inform the customers why or what we are waiting for, but all I see are the floor staff standing around behind the cashier counter.

Anyhow, as I was waiting I learned a little bit more about this restaurant and their chicken.  Each piece of chicken is freshly fried upon order for 7 minutes, so that they are remain fresh and crispy.  In addition, they do not cut the chicken into little bite size pieces for you, as they want to maintain the juiciness and moisture of the chicken.  

Here's a closer look at their menu.  As you can see only the Original Large Fried Chicken is available.  I was told by the cashier that they are limiting to only one order per customer.  I was surprised that there were no signs or notices in the restaurant stating that.  I also wanted to try out their Fried King Oyster Mushroom, but it was unavailable. 

Their pick up area is nice and clean with a huge logo.  I didn't have to wait for the full 7 mins for my chicken to be ready, it was more like 2-3 minutes.  They also have a promotion right now, all fried chicken comes with a free soft drink.  But I still think it's over priced - $9.99 + HST for a piece of fried chicken and a soft drink (this is equivalent to buying 3 pieces of chicken in Taiwan).

Not going to lie, their Original Large Fried Chicken is very delicious.  It's crispy on the outside, while the inside still remains tender and moist.  Definitely one of the best street food I have ever had.

In general, I did not have a great experience at my time visiting this restaurant.  I felt like everything was out of place.  The staff were not well trained.  During my 50 minutes at the restaurant, I spent over 40 minutes waiting because they were not ready to open.  The rating that I gave to them was solely on the taste of their chicken.

TIPS:
-if you would like to try out everything on their menu, I would highly suggest you to visit them at a later time (maybe in a month or so, when they are more settled)
-be prepared to wait in line 
-they have limited quantities of chicken, once they are sold out, they'll call it a night
-availability of their menu is subject to change without notice"}
{"text":"After paying 9.99+ tax..I realized how much I miss Taiwan because their chicken is probably under $4 lol. I lined up today for about 35 minutes. Their chicken is made to order and there is a pick up line. For now, it's one chicken per customer. I got the original with pepper salt, and it comes with a free pop. 

Their chicken is huge! It's best to eat it after you get it because it's all hot and crispy. Even though they show the full menu, they're not selling most of them yet. 

Worth a try if you like fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and after work on a Thursday and didn't have to wait long at all.

Ordered popcorn chicken twice, once as just pepper and salt and the second time with mild spice. The mild spice is definitely the better way to go, but if I had a choice, I'd choose Papa Chang's popcorn chicken over this.

Also tried the original chicken with extra spice and it was pretty good. Juicy, spicy, and crispy."}
{"text":"Went to Hot Star for the first time on a Monday around 3pm and luckily there was no line up. I ordered the Original Large Chicken with salt and pepper. It was $11.30 and was made fresh to order. I waited approximately 10-15 min and it was served nice and hot. The chicken was juicy and the batter was crispy but I think it was overpriced for what you get. Also, watch out for the bones when you get close to the bottom of the cutlet!"}
{"text":"Tasty but in think mostly from msg...so if you are like me and sensitive to msg...get ready to get tired from it.

Nice piece of chicken for the price.  Also liked the Nuggets. 

Cooked in peanut oil so avoid if you have a peanut allergy."}
{"text":"I walked past this place so many times, but finally got to try it. I love fried chicken, but I have to say this Taiwanese fried chicken was just average. I tried the original with medium spice. The \"crispy\" skin became soggy, but the chicken I have to say is moist.  

The cashier was nothing out of the ordinary and the wait was long to fry up the chicken. Clean and cute environment. 

I would come by again if I had to grab something quick. 

Visited: Not sure of exact date, but once late 2017 and sometime in January 2018."}
{"text":"Hot Star is a popular Taiwanese chain that made its way to toronto these past few months.

The restaurant similar to a fast food layout: you line up to order, line up to pick up and then wait for your huge piece of fried, crispy, deliciousness. I decided to go with the spicy with salt and pepper flavour classic chicken cutlet as well as the green apple yoghurt drink. Despite a 20 min wait, the chicken is crunchy, juicy and perfectly seasoned. Did I mention how large it is?? I was famished that day and I still couldn't finish. 

The only down sides I would say is the lack of options and protein overkill. They do not offer any sides despite the deceiving menu, although this may change in the future. I would revisit if I ever have a craving for fried chicken, although it probably would not happen for a while."}
{"text":"On Saturday night around 9pm after the basketball game, we decided to pop in on Hot Star Large Chicken (it is all the rave right now for a 30 cm piece of chicken breast) to try it out ! So here's the thing, I'm all for waiting in line for new delicious foods .. 

However, 1) there was no line up - took about 2 minutes to order, which was awesome ! 2) it took them an additional 30 minutes to get one piece of chicken breast !!!! 

IMO, waiting 30 min completely ruined my appetite. It was definitely not worth the wait on what they claim \"fry for 7 minutes\" chicken (I know maybe there is probably another process behind the chicken, but still 30 minutes ?!) .. Sigh. What a let down. 

Btw, we ordered \"little spicy  salt and pepper\" .. The spice was definitely \"HOT\"."}
{"text":"Apparently, Hot Star is really popular in Taiwan. I decided to give it a try to see what the rave is all about. We ordered the original fried chicken in the seaweed flavour, and to be honest, it tasted quite bland. I could barely taste the seaweed flavour at all. It might be because they only sprinkled a bit of seaweed seasoning on one side of the chicken? I haven't tried it, but I would presume the pepper salt flavour tastes better. Don't get me wrong though- the chicken itself was still very crispy and satisfying! I like that there was just the right amount of breading (unlike KFC, where there's more breading than chicken). But I still don't think it's worth the $10. 

We also tried the fried king oyster mushroom. DO NOT GET THIS! The mushrooms did taste good and not too salty, but for the minimal number of pieces you get, it is definitely not worth $4.99. 

As for wait time, we got our order in about 15 minutes. We went during a busy time, so we also had to wait a bit for seating.

Overall, I'm glad I tried this place, but I would probably not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Although Hot Star didn't live up to my expectations overall, I have to admit the chicken is pretty damn good. Meat was tender, well-seasoned and not dry at all! However, the batter is quite thick so it was really heavy especially upon the first few bites where there is little to no chicken to go with it. The best part is towards the middle (where all the meat is) but as you move closer to the end, you'll have to eat around the bones which is a little annoying. Its a good snack to eat in the cold as it comes out piping hot.

They don't cut the chicken into smaller pieces in order to retain the moisture so it's not really sharing-friendly. 

Considering the size, I don't think the pricing is outrageous nor is it really fair to compare it to what you'd pay in Taiwan. I didn't regret it but I'd think twice about going back since it failed to leave a lasting impression.

It can be pretty confusing because most people automatically start standing behind whoever is closest to the door without realizing that there are two separate lines (order and pick-up) and the longer one is most likely the pick-up line. So beware of that to prevent wasting your time.

I spent about 30 minutes in this place altogether - 10 or less in the order line and 20 in the pick-up when I came in on a late Saturday afternoon. It wasn't that bad as I've waited longer (ahem* Uncle Tetsu) but it's definitely not a place to go for a quick grab by any means."}
{"text":"I tried it, it was good, a novelty. Will I try it again? Probably not. Large piece tasted like the Taiwanese popcorn chicken I once had but better since it was very moist. Quite salty though. No line but there is a wait while it's being made."}
{"text":"A big ass piece of fried chicken. What more could I ask for?
Awesome concept. I mean sometimes you want to say screw the sides And just give me the meat. 
Juicy inside with every bite with golden crispy outside.
Comes in several different flavors. Original, Salt and Pepper, Spicy, etc.
I ordered the Spicy one and it was good. I mean like real good. And you can request  different spice levels. Be careful though, Taiwanese apparently like their spice.
I ordered a combo with fries and a drink. Almost $20. 
Whoa!!!! Too expensive for lunch.
For my drink I had a cucumber mojito(alcohol free). Very tasty.
I would definitely go back cause it's fried chicken and everybody loves fried chicken including me.
Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken place was pretty packed  we went in the lunch and stood in line for a good 30 minutes. The have a one per customer policy which is good. Because it speeds up the lineup. This is a taiwan franchise first time in toronto. Now onto the chicken. The chicken was indeed very fresh and tender. Which is exactly what they advertise and you want. We had the salt and pepper sauce. As well as the spicy extra one. The salt and pepper was the same flavour as the popcorn chicken in bubbletea places they are famous for.  The chicken is cooked very well. Even though it is breast it is very smooth and good. The only thing is it is too salty. As the drinks are definetely required becuase the seasoning is a bit too strong. The drinks that come in a combo. Such as blur curaco and passionfruit. The blue curaco is okay. It taste like the asian yogurt drinks. But the passionfruit is a little too sweet.  The portion is just right for lunch as you feel it is just enough.  If anyone is to eat here. I would suggest ask them to but less salt. As it is too strong. Overall it is good fried chickenm and worth a try. I would suggest go right at 11 in the morning at opening to avoid the lineups and treat it as brunch."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Hot Star. Here are my thoughts:

1) What's good
- I've been here twice and the chicken has been great both times. The first time I had the original with salt and pepper and the second time I had the bbq sauce. The latter resulted in a soggier chicken but was still good. 

2) What's not so good
- The wait: we ordered two chicken pieces and fried king oyster mushroom.  Even though there was no line up, we waited around 12 minutes for our food. 
- Prices are on the high side for the amount of food. We paid around $35 for two chicken pieces, king oyster mushrooms, a pop and bottle of water. 
- The fried king oyster mushroom is pretty bland and not worth the price. 
- I'm all for tipping but not when it's an automatic option when paying by card

Overall, I do like the chicken but I'll probably come less frequently due to the cost."}
{"text":"Ok the chicken is pretty damn delicious! So big and crispy and juicy! I could almost finish the whole thing lol. The drink pairings wouldn't that great but I would definitely have the chicken over and over again."}
{"text":"This place should be renamed to \"We Take Our Sweet Ass Time\" Large Fried Chicken.

Jks, but seriously.  There was no line, and only 3 people waiting in front of me for their order, and it still took a good 15 minutes to receive my order.

I ordered the regular chicken w/ the strawberry drink (forgot what it's called).  The chicken was pretty good, I must admit.  The drink, however, was decent - tasted like strawberry Sprite -  but not worth ~$3.50.

Come here only if you have time to spare."}
{"text":"We've been three times in the past 24 hours! Needless to say, this stuff is quite addictive. I would recommend the popcorn chicken over the famous large fried chicken breast because it tastes exactly the same and you get around 15 decent sized pieces.The large fried chicken breast is big enough to be shared between two people. 

Taste wise, the batter and seasoning is very flavorful and not greasy. The chicken inside was moist and tender. The fries were also crispy and delicious.

For what you get, it can be very pricey. For example, the chicken popcorn meal with a drink and fries came oit to $15 and the large fried chciken breast combo came out to $18. The specialty drinks are good but you can get by with bringing your own bottle of water.The fries by itself is only $2.99 and you get quite a lot so I would repurchase that. But the chicken itself is just too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"I guess I was lucky to go during a time with no lineup. If you are in a rush, keep in mind it will take about 15 min for your order (no exaggeration, they make it fresh) Even though this is \"fast food\" it does take some time. 

Place is relatively clean - staff wipe down the tables frequently enough. Comfortable enough in the place. 

The chicken is really good! My only issue with it is how 90% of it is meat, but they leave a small bit of bone at the end of it, which kind of throws off the experience of the delicious bites of fried chicken. I had the curry flavour, and was curious when ordering how it would turn out. It is quite tasty! The chicken is really hot and fresh out of the fryer and juicy inside. 

If I am craving for a sheet of chicken, or just fried chicken I would come again."}
{"text":"Love the fried chicken here!  It was crispy, spicy and juicy.  The restaurant was clean and bright! I have gone back a couple of times and the chicken and fries are so consistent.  I hope they open more franchises as this place is very popular in Taiwan."}
{"text":"I just came back from vacation in Taipei , and I was really thrilled but the food there. One of my favour food was Hot Star fried chicken in Shilin night market. Back at home in Toronto and I really want to try the Hot Star here to see if it is similar to the one in Taiwan and hope to become a regular customer if it is really good.

I ordered an original flavour friend chicken, sweet potato fries with plum powder and a passion fruit drink. I have to say, I was rather disappointed. Chicken was okay but didn't have much flavour inside , flavour was added by adding the level of spicy outside of the friend chicken . The plum powder on the sweet potato fries tasted rather likes sweeteners , we didn't enjoy it as much. The drink wasn't anything special but the price tag is on the high side .

I probably wouldn't want to become a regular here. Maybe I will go to Popeyes if I am craving for friend chicken . Hope the review helps . I love the hot star in Taipei!"}
{"text":"Went to try this place to see what all the big hype was all about regarding the large fried taiwanese chicken. It wasn't busy when I first went. I got the large fried chicken and it ended being around $11-$12. It was okay but personally I thought there wasn't really anything special about it. I still prefer Korean Fried Chicken as it's more flavorful and better bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I love their chicken it's sooooo good! It's very fresh and delicious! I love the batter they use on the outside and the chicken is very juicy! Even though it's $10 for once large price of chicken I would say it's an okay price for it!"}
{"text":"We only tried the big spicy chicken here and it was great.  The drinks were a little over rated.  Not sure about the other items on Hot Star's menu, but the spicy chicken (what they're famous for) was really nicely seasoned, large, and tasted very juicy.  I'd say it's worth checking this place just to try that chicken."}
{"text":"The concept is fast food but you do have to wait 10-20minutes for them to freshly fry your chicken. I had the original one with a little spicy, and it is crispy with juicy tender meat inside. Greasy goodness to satisfy your crispy chicken cravings. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Not bad for a tasty fried chicken joint. A little bit of a wait time for the chicken but a must for the satisfaction of the tastebuds! A word to the wise...If you can't take the heat, DO NOT order the spicy or else you'll 'die' and end up ripping off the skin. Just order the bare naked crispy. Guaranteed that you'll love that crispness!"}
{"text":"Long line up, limited seating, takes their time for your order just for Fried Chicken. However the  large fried chicken does taste really fresh and good. I would recommend it to everyone. Other than the line up, wait, and trying to find a seat, its a pretty decent snack!

if you like fried chicken, it is a must try. 

Thanks for my taiwanese friend who brought me there!"}
{"text":"I walked past the place around 5pm on a Saturday and could smell the amazing aroma all the way outside. Since there wasn't a line, so I thought I would give it a try.

The restaurant is really small. There's probably only enough seating for around 20 people, so definitely not a good place for a large crowd. However, the entire place was spotless. The staff was also extremely friendly. They all speak chinese fluently, which is probably why their clientele is mainly Chinese, but will switch to English if you look at them confused.

When I went, there wasn't a line at the cashier to order the food. However, I still had to wait around 20 minutes for them to fry my chicken, which I think is pretty slow when there's only 5 orders ahead of me.

I ordered two of their regular fried chicken, both with a medium spice. Like everyone else said, the chicken is HUGE. I should have just ordered one, which would have been more than enough for my boyfriend and I to share as a \"light\" dinner. The chicken was fried to a perfection. I understand why everyone raves about it. It was juicy, crunchy and tender! My only complaint is that the spice wasn't evenly coated around the chicken, so one bite would be super spicy and another would be plain. I also ordered a hot milk tea, which was also pretty yummy, but it's nothing too extraordinary.

Overall, I deducted one star because for me, fried chicken, no matter how amazing, is not worth a 20 minute wait and $10 a piece.

Edit: both the boyfriend and I got really bad indigestion later that night. While I'm not 100% sure it was due to the chicken, please be warned. Boyfriend says it was still worth the stomachache though"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????Yonge st????????????????????????????9.9?????????????????????????????????????????d????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Interesting, novel and tasty!

I ordered the Crispy, extra spicy chicken. The chicken was moist and the batter had a really hard crunch to it. I was a bit disappointed by the spice though. It doesn't seem to be embedded in the batter, but rather, it's a powdery spice that gets sprinkled on top of the chicken after the frying is done. The spice isn't granular but more like a light powder (sort of like red icing sugar) and it blows off very easily. It's easy to accidentally inhale too, which is not a good thing. Overall, it didn't really give the spicy kick I was hoping for, and the messiness of the powder was a bit of a nuisance.

The place was clean, staff were friendly and accommodating.

I'd come back again, to try the Original fried chicken, maybe without so much spicy powder. In terms of first impressions for fried chicken, The Fry stood out a bit more in terms of taste."}
{"text":"My sister remarks we should have tried this whilst in Taiwan--the novelty would be much cheaper to indulge at its origins. Then again, what's so exciting about fried chicken anyways, even if it is a Taiwanese take on it?

This Taiwanese chain has imported itself to Toronto, like many other Asian food names lately, and I'm scratching my head on \"large\" fried chicken Hot Star specialize in. A huge katsu/big-ass schnitzel sized piece of flattened chicken breast, very greasy and messy, not crispy at all, kills you at $10, and takes 10 minutes to make. Don't ever pick the \"BBQ\" version, it is a friggin' ripoff (it might just have been their regular chicken with extra coating of something on top of the loose sesame-dressed soaking wet batter, I dunno). Huge as it may be, that piece of chicken will fill up small stomachs.

A pricey one-off novelty by Toronto standards. Overall, quite disappointing, still not excited about fried chicken."}
{"text":"Concept is better than the reality. They leave the bone and gristle in the chicken so you take a bit and take your chances as to what is below the crispy coating. It's pretty greasy too and the batter has a sweet taint which leaves a horrible aftertaste of sweet, grease and chicken in your mouth. Had to try it but I won't return."}
{"text":"Feeling peckish (hahaha) a group of friends and I decided to check this fried chicken place out.  We had heard it had just opened and there were lineups.  However later in the evening and I guess after the hype died down we headed over and luckily enough got a table.  There are only a few tables in here so you may be better to get takeout if it's busy.

The chicken is like a flat cutlet - it's kinda weird.  Bone in chicken that's flat.  We ordered one piece - the original (I think it was like $10) and some popcorn chicken that I think was about $6-7.  The cutlet is pretty big - if you just want a snack it's good for 2 people.  I believe we just kept is simple with one level of spice and got the pepper flavour.  The popcorn chicken pieces were bigger than other places but you got about 10 or so \"kernels\".  They were ok, nothing I would order again.  

It comes in a large blue/white bag - something like you would eat at the CNE to be honest.  this is exactly where this place would fit in.  I'm not sure as a restaurant if it can last once the hype dies down.   It wasn't bad tasting and was more juicy than I thought a flat piece of chicken could have been but I don't think I would have stood in line for it - I would have been disappointed."}
{"text":"love this place! I would always come here after a raptors game. If you love fried food and chicken than this is the place. I always get the fried chicken salt pepper style. Love it!"}
{"text":"Hot-Star Large Fried Chicken seems to be getting a lot of hype over the size of the chicken breast that they sell.  I went there today to find out.

$9.99 gets you a chicken breast and a free pop.  The size of the chicken breast is big, but it certainly was not huge like the hype train described (30 cms).  The taste is definitely authentic, and they fry the chicken breast as you order them, so you don't have to worry it being prefried before you arrived but do understand that you will be waiting a bit for your order to come.  I waited around 7 minutes or so.  Keep in mind today was the grand opening so a combination of lack of experience and cohesion and the grand opening rush may have something to do with it.

The only complaint I have about Hot-Stars is its painfully expensive price for a single piece of chicken breast.  Yes, it is organic chicken breast free of antibiotics and bacteria, but $9.99 is definitely on the expensive side if it only gives you a single chicken breast and pop without rice or anything else.

Hot-Stars was great for a nostalgia rush for me, an expensive one, and it's not something I can justify taking too often at its price:value ratio."}
{"text":"The chicken is very large, fresh, hot and tasty, but i'm still not sure it's worth the price...it comes in a paper holder? in  a plastic bag to carry out, but the paper gets greasy quickly,doesnt protect your hands from the heat, and the bag traps the steam making the chicken a little soggy. The fries, sweet potato fries, and popcorn chicken are also flavoured with the same seasoning, and i found the portion very small. the passion fruit drink isnt bad, but the strawberry one is strange. I'll give this place 3 stars because it is tasty, but this would be a very rare treat."}
{"text":"I was super jealous of all my friends who were able to get themselves a piece of Hot Star, but that is, until I actually tried it myself and discovered that it's probably just not for me. I got the spicy fried chicken, and while the chicken was flavourful, I found it to be too oily for my liking. I also wasn't a fan of how dense the chicken was - I think they flatten it on purpose, but the density made each bite a bit too heavy. Don't be fooled by the size, one is usually going to be quite filling.

The line really died down for this place just a few months after it opened - it looks like people in general weren't all that impressed with the place. It's a shame because I really wanted them to do well so that we have more of a variety of fast food fried chicken places aside from KFC and Popeyes, but I don't think this place will steal much business from them. Their menu is fairly small at the moment (although it looks like they're going to offer more in the future), so it's possible that in the future maybe I'll enjoy their chicken in form of a burger, that might be good.

The other issue for me is the absurdly long wait time after you order the chicken. I understand that they're trying to make everything fresh, yet the place is set up more like a fast food joint so it's a surprising long wait. It would be helpful perhaps if they could give each customer an approximate wait time so that we can be better prepared.

There were a few things I did like about this place though. First, their drinks were quite good - few people probably come here to grab their juices, but they're actually quite good and on par with the quality of drinks you get from a bubble tea shop. Second, while the fried chicken took some time to come out, the servers were all friendly. I even saw one of the servers actually walk out of the restaurant to give the customer their order while they waited in their car... I think that's a little excessive but it was nice of her to do it. Third, their sweet potato fries were one of the best I've ever had. Don't be scared of the word \"plum\" in the front, that hint of plum actually makes the fries taste even better.

Although I probably won't be rushing to come here for their fried chicken, I would be happy to come here if my friends wanted to. I just would opt out of their chicken for the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Horrible service, for some reason the owners went out of their way to hire individuals with the worst possible English."}
{"text":"Fried chicken has always been and will always be a guilty pleasure for most. With the recent resurgence of fried chicken you can see why this place has perhaps received a lot more hype then they so deserve.

I don't quite know who invented this stuff but friend chicken has come a long way and is has surely cemented itself as a global \"dish\". From the Americans to the Chinese, Japanese, Koreans and now even the Taiwanese are getting in the mix of things. Although the Taiwanese have always had their popcorn chicken thing but this \"large\" fried chicken idea is pretty new to us.

Let's get right into it. The chicken is tender and packed with flavour. Perhaps even a little salty for some. It oozes with bright flavours from 5 spice to peppers, basil and maybe even a little MSG thrown in. It's served piping hot in a paper pouch a la Mickey D's famous hash browns.

The chicken itself tastes great but I wouldn't say the same of the batter. This chicken violates one of the most basic laws of deep fried anything; the batter must not separate from the object it's fried with. I find that the batter i also much too chewy for my liking as it reminded me bit like the tapioca (bubbles, pearls) you get in your bubble tea.

They also did not execute the grab-and-go concept that I think they are striving for. Being surprised by bones in your chicken 3/4 of the way done can be a painful and unpleasant experience; as it did for me. Granted one of my buddies did mention he vaguely saw a sign somewhere by the ordering counter that cautioned us of this.

So there you have it. One part deliciousness (kinda) and 2 parts of glaring conceptual and execution flaws equals Hot Star Large Fried Chicken (seriously, who named this place??). For better Taiwanese fried chicken, I suggest you head west to Kookoo."}
{"text":"I came back because they introduced the cheesy chicken and I'm a huge fan of cheese but I wasn't really a fan of this concept. I had high hopes especially after seeing their video but in reality the taste wasn't anything special  and I still find it quite expensive. When I cut it in half, one half of it was just bones. 

I ordered the cheesy chicken and king mushroom to share with a friend and it costed nearly $20 tax included.

This place is overhyped and the money just isn't worth it, unfortunately"}
{"text":"Hot Star is a unique spot in Downtown Toronto that is offering Taiwanese Chicken. Now, there are plenty of Taiwanese places, especially in the GTA Markham area, but this is probably one of the few in the downtown core. What makes this place a bit more unique is this flattened bone in chicken breast that they have.

We tried one of those with the original batter and seasoning. Also had a popcorn chicken too because it looked so good. The chicken breast was pretty good and meaty, despite how flat it was. I thought it would be like a German Schnitzel, but was thicker than that. The spices used were good and had a nice kick. The bone is still attached so just be aware of that when you are biting into one end.

The popcorn chicken tasted fine, but portion was also small. For the price, you'd expect a bit more. The chicken pieces were good. Batter is light like the chicken breast, but tiny pieces. 

Though the chicken tasted pretty decent, the price is high. The breast is large, but that is also due in part to it being flattened. $10 for one breast is too much for me. It is also essentially food you find on a fairground, so not worth it too much for me. They have other items but this is their most famous.

Also...they REFUSE to hand out any knives so no luck trying to use anything but your hands. Maybe a fork?"}
{"text":"I'll give this place 3.5/5 stars. 
At the beginning, *the first bite* it was definitely at 5 stars - the \"omg! I'm so coming back for this.\" But then it gets to a point where the fried chicken became bland :( Note that the portion is huge, one was more than enough for me. 

There's a graph on the wall of this place indicating how the first bite is the best part too haha. 

I'd recommend the:
SEAWEED FLAVOUR FRIED CHICKEN :)

We ordered the regular crispy flavour and thought the seafood one wins by far. This place is great for a try, but I don't think I'll return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ordered: classic fried chicken- $9.99 (before tax)

Came here on a saturday night and needless to say there was a line. However it wasn't as I bad as I anticipated. When you enter tge store, the longest line you'll see is most likely the order pick up line on the left. You have to walk further in to order at the cashier that's right beside the kitchen. It does get confusing because they don't have a sign for ordering...don't know how many times I had to tell new customers where the line was to order. There's a menu at the cashier so you can just point at what you want. The selection is limited with the option of the classic fried chicken, popcorn chicken and a few drinks. I ordered the classic fried chicken (medium spicy)and two drinks. I had to wait at least 10 mins for my order. The drinks were nothing special so I wouldn't reccommend ordering them. The chicken as advertised was HUGE, you could definitely share it with a friend or eat the rest for another meal. It wasn't too spicy so don't be afraid to try the spicy option, I would probably ask for the extra spicy next time. The chicken was very tender and I liked how the crust wasn't too thick. However having tried the fried chicken in Taiwan it was slightly different. I noticed that the crispy outer layer would seperate from the meat so it felt like you were eating the meat and the skin separately. The real Taiwanese fried chicken has a slightly crispier outer layer that actally stuck to the meat and of course it's wayyyy cheaper in Taiwan night markets. Overall go and try it just so you can cross that off your list but otherwise it's not somewhere I would go often."}
{"text":"We didn't wait too long in the line up, but waiting for the food was more than 20 minutes. The service was inefficient and I don't think any of them spoke English. They were rude. If you weren't Asian, they treated you differently.

We ordered the combo, which includes: the chicken, fries and a drink. The total was approx $20. The chicken was very thin and very greasy. I used two forks to eat it, as I didn't want to get oil everywhere. There were people there eating their chicken with plastic gloves.

Nothing special. Not worth $10 a piece, definitely better off going to Popeyes where everyone is welcomed. 100%. My first and last time here."}
{"text":"Ok my Taiwanese friend told me this place is an Authentic Taiwanese Franchise. well known for their Big A** Deep Fried Chicken! So I went in to get me a piece! I love spice so I decided to order the Extra Spicy Chicken! Boy was it spicy..and I forgot to get a drink, so it didn't help either lol. I ended up peeling the spice side off, (spice was only rubbed on 1 side of the chicken) it was burning my lips. But the chicken itself was sooooo crispy and extremely moist and juicy. 

I would definitely stop by the store again when I'm in the area and get me some more. :)"}
{"text":"I placed an order with the most popular one they have, the big piece of chicken. We have 2 people and we're not that hungry so i think 1 for 2 is good enough. We got so full with that, crispy, a bit spicy (you can ask for this) and really hot and big (bigger than my face lmao)
Nice service and nice place."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this place. It's a Taiwanese chain famous for its fried chicken breast. I ordered their chicken nuggets combo 1. Came with a drink. The chicken nuggets was decent, although it seemed the quality have declined since the last time I visited. The blue caracao yogurt drink was not bad either."}
{"text":"Walking down Yonge street, I noticed a few people holding white paper bags with something crispy inside. It looked good and I was curious. I stopped someone and asked them to point me in the direction of this crispy deliciousness. 

I walked up Yonge street, and came across Hot-Star. It's a modern looking fast food joint. There's about 30 seats. I walked in and there wasn't any sign of an employee. I waited for about 5 minutes and rang the bell. Nothing.... waiting another 5 minutes and someone came in from the back. 

Finally! I placed my order, I was feeling the extra large fried chicken stuffed with cheese. I waited for about 15 minutes, and asked what was going on. The server said it'll be out soon. I waited another 30 minutes till finally she called out my order number. 

I walked back to work, very excited to bite into my fried chicken. This thing was HOT, also kinda spicy which I loved. I took my first bite and wow, an explosion of flavour hit me. It was very very juicy. I took another bite and hot cheese poured out. This was getting kinda messy. 

Hot cheese oozing out, and I was really enjoying my Fried Chicken. I took about another 2 bites before I realized I hit a bone. This is what I DID NOT LIKE, instead of it being a chicken breast, most of it was all bones. That was annoying. I hate playing around with my food and so I didn't like the fact that I kept getting bones or fatty bits. 

If there is anyway that they could do it with a chicken breast then I would be in trouble. 

Keep Eating, 

Angela"}
{"text":"When I found out that all my friends were talking about a cheap, delicious fried chicken place I had to come check it out. I came with one other person and we both ordered the original, as spicy as it could be.

The chicken is a great size - it's hammered flat so that the breading-to-chicken ratio is swung more towards the breading than usual. The meat was surprisingly soft and juicy, and the batter was the right thickness. If you're craving fried chicken I would have no qualms recommending you come here and buy a piece.

However, there are a few drawbacks. The drinks are very expensive ($4 for juice, iirc) and there is not much seating. The lines get very long at peak hours as well. Lastly, to make it spicy, they just add spices to the chicken after it's fried, so that it's basically dusty with cayenne. I wish they had come up with some other way of doing this. 

I understand that the menu will be improving in the near future as well."}
{"text":"This place should get 6 stars, actually it should get 7 stars. I stumbled upon Hot Star a few years ago and have been a loyal customer ever since. I came by Saturday afternoon for lunch while I was craving the Original Fried Chicken. This place usually has a good amount of people inside and generally has a 5-10 minute wait time (which is 100% worth it). The chicken here is absolutely mouth watering. It's as juicy as chicken can be, seasoned with the perfect spices, and will leave you full and craving more at the same time. If you are reading this right now, please stop and start ordering, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Tasty chicken! Typical Taiwanese style, where it's lightly fried, breaded, and with some salt and pepper. The spicy has a bit of a kick to it but don't expect the glorious spice that induces next-day ring-of-fire. This is a good or a bad thing, whatever floats your boat.

The chicken is big(ger than my face), and feels satisfyingly filling. But at $10, it doesn't feel like a complete meal (what about some veggies? Carbs?). Was hungry a few hours later.

Service is friendly but a little slow. Seems like they fry the chicken fresh from raw with each order. It tastes piping hot at least, so it's worth it.

Was a tasty snack. Would come again with friends who haven't tried for the novelty, but otherwise, I'd rather grab $10 worth of Popeyes."}
{"text":"Honestly much better than their Taiwanese counterpart!!!! I went back to Taiwan again recently and honestly you don't have to travel half way across the globe to try this :P. Their chicken was so crisp on the outside, I've tried the original and the bbq flavors,  both amazing with the juicy, tender meat. The BBQ sauce did make the crispy breaking a bit soggy but the original one with dry seasoning was perfect.

 I also ordered the plum sweet potato wedge/fries and it was unfortunately something I wouldn't order again. The plum flavour/seasoning on the potato exterior was very artificial and the added sweetness from the flavour tasted like aspartame or Splenda. 

I think I will only come back for their fried chicken."}
{"text":"I love their chicken popcorn. So good and crispy. I wish there was an option to eat their fried big chicken pieces on a plate though. I have trouble eating in my hand since they are so big and so hot when they are freshly fried. The chicken itself is so juicy and flavourful."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Hot-Star Large Fried Chicken for the longest time! I've seen many pictures of the iconic large chicken inside the paper bag and wanted to try it out! However, I ended up ordering the Chicken Popcorn which comes in two flavours of your choice; salt pepper or spicy. I chose the former. I ordered it as a combo without the fries and with the Sunrise Strawberry Soda drink, which was delicious. I cannot stop thinking about that drink until this day. 

The worker was very friendly and explained the meals and how the combos worked. Everything about Hot-Star was nearly perfect, except for the fact that they use a lot of plastic bags! I did not know that they would put my food inside a plastic bag while sitting inside the restaurant. If you are planning to sit indoors, tell the worker(s) beforehand that you do not need the plastic bag!"}
{"text":"If you suffer from FOMO (and I'd say most Yelpers would qualify as so afflicted) then you need to experience Hot Star at least once. Get yourself one chicken breast which has been somehow shaped into a ginormous schnitzel-type monstrosity. Sure it's more protein than most of us require in one meal. But you know you want to try it. Don't complain about the bones at the end of your deep-fried chicken indulgence, it's the nature of the beast. And definitely don't complain about the price of your Passion Fruit Soda...you pay the same damn prices at Starbucks. Just because it's not drowning in sugar and whipped cream doesn't mean it's a sub-par drink and not worthy...it's an Asian-thing, 'k? And for the love of Pete...you know Taiwan is not the same as Thailand, right? Just checking! (Full disclosure, I was born in Taiwan.)"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly amazing!!! Fresh, hot, crispy. Long wait time was worth it. 

I heard about Hot-star for awhile now. I always thought it was just a hype thing. Decided to finally try it out for once. I tried the crispy fried chicken - spicy. It took about ~15 minutes-- you're free to sit in the meantime as they'll call out your order. It was super hot--fresh out the deep frier and suuper crispy!!! 

The chicken is just so juicy and tender and flavourful. I'm definitely coming back and recommending this place to everyone I know!!! There's a little bone part so you have something to hold onto as you nibble away. 

Their drinks looked good too, I'll be sure to try it sometime!"}
{"text":"Everything that everyone has said here was true for my experience. 

I initially walked by this place doing some sight seeing and thought it was this run down restaurant. I mean, with a sign outside that says, \"Best Chicken in Taiwan,\" what was I to think? How shocked I was when I looked it up online and read the reviews. I decided I had to try this Hot Star out. 

Stopped in around 1PM on a Friday. There were a few people inside already, and went up to the counter to order. The cashier told me they weren't open yet, but would be in ten minutes. Cut to 40 minutes later, when I finally ordered. Their menu is still extremely limited: regular chicken, crispy chicken, spicy chicken, fries, and a few drinks/juices. 

The restaurant is small and new, but poorly designed. There are maybe 10 seats in the place, with an entire wall covered in a wood paneled design - should have made more seating there. But it's a piece of chicken that you can walk with, so no big deal there. 

The chicken? It's huge. It's fried. It's crispy. It's delicious. Like other people have said, it is just a piece of fried chicken, so it's not something totally new. But sometimes a piece of fried chicken is all you need to make your day. Thanks, Hot Star."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place since it was opened. Came on a weekday 2:00pm no lineup.

I got the original large chicken. You can choose between original or spicy (a few different levels). It came out piping hot. I was surprised how large it was. It was a lot of chicken way more then I expected. Also it was not deboned. The first bit was full of pepper and the aroma was simply amazing. Would visit again."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in here a few minutes before they opened on a Saturday. Luckily we beat the line ups. I ordered the original large fried chicken medium spice with seaweed and  a apple Yogurt drink 

Overall the wait time was about 10 minutes, loved how it is made to order and fresh however,  beware bones towards the bottom half. I was impressed with the seasoning batter and juiciness as well as size of the chicken. 

I would definitely come back for more. Not to mention the apple Yogurt drink was task and went well with the chicken =)"}
{"text":"MUST TRY:
Crispy Large Cheese Chicken (order it spicy)
Original Large Fried chicken (Spicy)

OK:
Yogurt drinks (Blue Curacao, Green Apple)

The new cheese infused Crispy Chicken is excellent. Perfectly cooked piece of fried chicken in a paper bag. The cheese is melted in the center. Although it can fall out if you are not paying attention, it is well place in the middle. If you take reason sized bites and then squeeze, the cheese will bubble up to the top, allowing you to get some chicken and cheese in the same bite. Great design!

At $12, it is fairly expensive. However, this is high quality fried chicken + cheese. Also, because the chicken is flattened, with most of the bones removed, the portion is fairly large. Probably equivalent to 3 pieces of chicken.

Order it spicy. My girlfriend and I shared one level 1 spicy and one level 2 spicy. It was hard for us to tell which was the medium. If you like spicy food, go for level 3 spicy without hesitation.

I loved the cheese version, but my girlfriend prefers the original chicken, which is breaded instead of crispy. We tried it previously at Hot Star in Hong Kong.

This location can get very busy. At 6:30pm on a Tuesday it was hard to get seats. It was quick to order, but took at least 15-20 minutes for our chicken to finish cooking.

Loud pop music filled the air, which could be annoying to some people. Some of the songs were terrible. Other songs were good, and one even had a couple of customers dancing around as they waited for their food.

The yogurt drinks are ok, but nothing special. As the names Blue Curacao and Green Apple suggest, the taste is heavily based on color. I would prefer to try the passion fruit soda next time."}
{"text":"Tried to come here a few times when it first opened but they ran out of chicken every time. Finally got to try it after the 3rd or 4th attempt. Wait time was reasonable ~30 minutes.

Overall, my expectations were met: a big piece of crunchy, juicy, pop corn chicken! Definitely not something you would want to eat everyday, but will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I thought coming here on opening weekend would be crazy talk, but nope. I walked by here at 2:30pm on Sunday afternoon. Fully expecting it to look like the scene outside of Uncle Tetsu's, but it wasn't bad at all. The queue was right at the door, so I got in and started my place in the queue. 

It could get a bit confusing since there's two separate queues; one for ordering and one for picking up. Since they were both bottle-necked at the door, it looked like one queue and I had to find my place. 

I was in and out of the restaurant with my fresh piece of fried chicken within 40 mins. I suppose I spent 20 minutes in each line. 

I was observing the few orders prior to mine to see how you're supposed to order, the people in front of me didn't do so and when they got to the cashier and he said \"pepper salt or spicy\", they had no idea what the guy meant, it means you can choose your topping. 

Each piece of chicken is made to order. They serve it in a pouch and you eat it as if it was a McDonald's hashbrown. It's crispy. It's juicy and tender. 

As it was opening weekend, only the original large fried chicken was on the menu (if you're lucky, you might be able to get popcorn chicken too). There are other fried items available, like fries, fried king oyster mushroom and sweet potato fries. 

There are two combos you can choose from, combo 1 includes a bubble tea, combo 2 includes a bubble tea and fries.

I really enjoyed the large fried chicken here and I am looking forward to returning to try other menu items."}
{"text":"To me, there is nothing more satisfying than devouring a large piece of fried chicken, and Hot Star delivers that special craving.

There is virtually no lineup now since it's been months since they grand opening. However, it still takes around 10 minutes for the order, because they make your food after you placed the order, to make sure it's freshly fried. Your number will be called once it's done. They only have forks at the restaurant, no knives, so if you want to share with a friend, you'd have to rip the chicken in halves. The chicken is so big because it's being held up by meat glue, find the seam, and it's easy to rip open. Be careful of the heat though.

I had the original and crispy chicken on separate visits. The original was flavourful, but I find the batter to be a little powdery. The crispy one was just ok. It was still good, but it didn't have as much character as the original flavour. Also, the crispy chicken that I got on my second visit was smaller than usual, so that's a rip off. Btw, be careful there are bones at the end of the chicken, which takes up around 1/5 of the chicken."}
{"text":"The whole fuss about Hot Star Large Fried Chicken was more of a novelty than anything else. Typical Taiwanese style. Flattened chicken breast, bone-in.  Lightly fried, breaded, and with some spices. I'd definitely add the seaweed seasoning. Not too spicy, but a slight kick. This can be a good or a bad thing, depending on what you like.

The chicken breast is huge once flattened (bigger than my fiancée's face). It was decently filling. For $10, it didn't feel like a complete meal. Fries cost extra, and their drink selection was very limited. Was hungry a few hours later.

Service was friendly but really slow. Seems like they fry the chicken fresh with each order, but there were like 8 people ahead of us. Took 20 minutes to receive our order. It was fresh hot right out of the fryer though, which was nice.

I would come again if I was in the area for a tasty snack, but otherwise."}
{"text":"- What I have tried: 
   +original fried chicken (4/5): skin is very crispy, chicken was so tender and juicy, really really enjoy it 
    + original chicken with seaweed flavour (3/5): I thought it was just ok, nothing much different with seaweed added
    + fried cheese chicken (4/5): highly recommend to go more than 2 level of spicy, I got mine 2 spicy level but did not even taste the heat (I'm the type who can only go maximum mild level at most restaurants). It didnt taste much different from the original except for the cheese. However the cheese was not distributed evenly, the more I ate the more cheesy it got. 
- Ordering is very fast however be ready to wait for about 20mins for your chicken, definitely not a good place to come when you're extremely hungry 
- Portion is big, but tbh one piece of chicken didnt fill me up :( 
- Lots of seatings inside
- Chicken will be extremely hot when it first came out, so be careful don't burn yourself"}
{"text":"This is a very unique fried chicken place that everyone should try at least once. The chicken itself is quite delicious in the beginning since its super hot and salty. 

However, what sucks is that the chicken has small bones in it which kinda ruins the whole experience. It also takes a long time for the chicken to get ready. I visited the place during lunch time and it took about 20 mins to get it ready. There were also only 2 other customers there so that wait time is unacceptable. The green apple drink is also worth getting since eating the chicken alone will leave you very thirsty."}
{"text":"When I was in Taiwan, this restaurant chain was everywhere like a McDonald's. 

It's main dish is a large half chicken (or something close to that) bone in, deep fried chicken served in a paper wrapper. 

Its a lot tastier then I'm describing it, and was quite addictive eating it at all the different night markets in Taipei. Closest comparison I can think of is a very large KFC, but with a lot less grease and a lot cheaper.

When I heard that there was an official restaurant in Toronto I had to come here to give it a try.

It's very close to how it is in Taipei, but doesn't quite do the original justice. The batter and chicken seemed to be a bit greasier and was falling off the meat a bit. So it did make it messier to eat. The chicken itself was juicy, and towards the bottom was the signature bone.

The reason why they make this chicken bone in is because they claim that it helps retain its moisture and makes it juicy, not sure how true that is though. Just an fyi for the other reviewers complaining about it.

Taste wise, and the entire meal is pretty bang on with Taipei. So if you don't enjoy eating this at all, dont bother having it in Taipei. But if you felt this was pretty good, but has room for improvement, you definitely need to try this in Taipei.

The place is quite small with a bunch of random tables people pull together. On a Friday night it was quite busy and mainly filled with university students it seemed.

A cheap meaty meal at $10 or so, pretty good deal compared to KFC. 

Make sure to grab a knife and fork and sit down to eat this, then the bone at the end won't be so bad."}
{"text":"Never expected to make an Yelp account, but after this visit I had to. The Chicken here is over priced and didn't really give me the \"WOW\" experienced I hoped it did, but turns out it the morning after. Just under a dozen of friends and I went here after a meal that wasn't filling enough, but only a few friends of mine had it; including myself. Only those friends and I were found sick the next day and we can pin point where it came from... this chicken place. The food handler in the back must of been coughing up a storm on the chickens he prepared. I would give this place -5 stars if I could. Come here if you want to be sick for a week."}
{"text":"Its pretty good!  It comes piping hot and the taste reminds me of popcorn chicken that you can get at Taiwanese bubble tea places.  I shared one and to be honest, it was enough chicken and greasy friedness for one night.  Got the medium spicey which was good.  They do run out often so if you go late at night, you might be SOL if you want the original chicken."}
{"text":"Ordered:

Crispy large chicken, $9.99.

Good-tasting, crispy and with addictive-spice smell.

Moist.

A bucket of KFC, crispy or regular still wins for me; taste & price-wise."}
{"text":"Good but very overpriced Taiwanese fried chicken.  It's literally a GIANT chicken breast, pounded, breaded w/potato starch, and fried.  The breast is juicy and the breading is hot and crispy.  The price is very steep at $11, including tax, for a single breast.  The wait time is also abysmally long.  We waited about 20 min to get our order.  It's worth a try but not sure I will be a repeat visitor."}
{"text":"It's worth a try, but maybe not a place that would make me come back over and over. The chicken is freshly cooked and it's pretty juicy. But it has quite a bit batter wrapping the meat and it's kinda greasy. It's good to share with some friends so that you got to taste it without getting tired of it."}
{"text":"it's a bit funny
to eat just bagged fried chicken
straight out of the bag

that's the appeal though,
since it's hot star's specialty
and it's not that bad!

bright, clean resto space

since it's near rye-high

steaming hot fried meat
tasty taiwanese five spice
and your choice of heat

{"text":"It just tastes like the fried chicken in Taiwan. So good. I'm really happy they opened a store here.
No more line here. I had the original fried chicken."}
{"text":"Omg YUM - having been a huge fan of Taiwanese night market style chicken, I was excited when this place opened.  We decided to come here for a quick lunch one day.  The wait wasn't as bad as another reviewer said here-  we got our chicken in a relatively reasonable time.  We ordered the combo, which was the chicken itself and a drink (strawberry fizz).

The chicken was hot, juicy, and extremely delicious.  I wasn't sure if I was going to be full after just chicken but it totally defeated me.  I could barely finish one.  

Overall, a huge win and definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"Walking down yonge street and decided to pop into this place which we had heard good things about. Not fancy, but bright, clean and fast. Fast and scorching hot. Delicious and it is fried with that yummy spicy salt that you often get at Chinese restaurants with squid or chicken.

I had a couple of pieces of the popcorn chicken.

I like that they use fresh chicken, no artificial flavours and no preservatives. 

Definitely a treat worth having!

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Oh gosh, so the chicken itself was pretty yummy, probably around 4 stars really. Usually this sort of chicken would be accompanied by a big bowl of rice in restaurants, but for Hot Star you just carry this flattened pancake-shaped chicken around instead. I recommend the seaweed chicken! The spicy one didn't taste as good. 

I docked off a few stars because the service is incredibly slow. We waited around for a long time before receiving our chicken, and as a tip you should just eat it in the restaurant. We took it back home to consume but at that point it wasn't very crispy, just soggy and drenched in oil. I would come back sometime if I wasn't in a rush to eat, and I'll probably bring my own pail of rice just in case."}
{"text":"Tried the popcorn and regular fried chicken... Was excellent! Crunchy crispy moist! Only thing is the wait time is a little long and the chicken is nuclear hot!"}
{"text":"The first time I visited, I tried their large fried chicken and it just wasn't for me. It was too salty and messy to eat, especially because the bone is left in. However, on my second visit, I was delightfully surprised how much I enjoyed it. We ordered the popcorn chicken (easy to eat and less salty), fries (standard), and their deep fried king oyster mushrooms (best thing on the menu). The mushrooms were amazing and I would go back just for that alone and nothing else. Also, don't be tricked by the short line cashing out, there will be a longer wait for your food to be ready."}
{"text":"My boyfriend (for privacy reasons I will just call him D) and I finally tried this place out yesterday. This is a typical fast food place. I found it was rather messy on the table tops - not very clean. There aren't a whole lot of seating available either. So don't think you can get a seat if you are a large group. 
D and I ordered the original combo with the seaweed seasoning and a green apple yogurt drink. The price was not cheap but I have to say the chicken that you get is very, very big. I liked the chicken it was very tasty and inside was very moist. I think I liked the green apple yogurt drink more though, maybe it was because it was just so hot outside yesterday and I was super thirsty, who knows. All I know is that I really liked the drink. 
Overall the food and drink was good, the seating was okay for a fast food place, but the price was a bit pricey for fried chicken even if the chicken is really big in portion."}
{"text":"If this was just about the chicken this would be a 5-star review. It's delicious. Unfortunately the service is atrocious. Of the two times I've gone, there is no rhyme or reason to what sequence the food comes out in and they ALWAYS seem confused about whether they have the correct order for the correct person. They gave me completely the wrong order this past time after I waited 20 minutes with no line and I didn't realize until I got home. Always check the bag before you leave."}
{"text":"I've tried every flavour except for the cheese filled and I love fried chicken so I think it's finally time for this review.

Definitely not my favourite fried chicken place by any standards. It's salty, and I feel like because they make it so flat, maybe less juicy.

However I just tried their Korean flavour because I LOVE Korean fried chicken and my friend and I agreed that it is bomb. Delicious. We got it super piping hot which it stayed until the last bite. It was sticky, messy, and addictive. We couldn't slow down eating it even though it burned our mouths (in temperature). Flavour isnt super powerful or spicy so it should definitely be tolerated by most people even those that can't handle spicy! Try it out of you like Korean chicken :)

As for the regular chicken, I find that as you ask for more spicier options the chicken becomes saltier because their spicy seasoning also has salt. It reminds me of spicy, ulta salty, dried instant noodle soup mix."}
{"text":"Torontonians are lucky recipients of the first North American location of Hot-Star Large Fried Chicken. Came here on a weeknight (no line-ups) and ordered the Original Fried Chicken - Less Spicy with Pepper Salt. It tastes just like Popcorn Chicken! Savoury, hot and crispy-crunchy goodness freshly cooked before your eyes. The Passion Fruit soda was a nice thirst quencher, but not worth the $4 extra."}
{"text":"Super tasty Taiwanese fried chicken! I'm a fried chicken addict, and when Hot-Star opened (just down the street from my apartment!!) I knew I had to try it out. Unfortunately I don't have the patience to stand in a long line up, so I didn't get to experience the large fried chicken until several months after its opening, but it was worth the wait.

The original large fried chicken is my go-to, and I love getting the pepper salt and/or the spicy seasoning on it. About 1/3 of the chicken is just bones, but it's at the bottom so you get to enjoy bone-less crispy deliciousness for the first 2/3 of the chicken! I recently tried the cheese stuffed fried chicken, and that was also VERY yummy. The cheese is limited to the top half, but there is enough in there to make it a 5 star experience (I also love cheese so fried chicken + cheese is just magical). I always order the passion fruit soda with my chicken - it's very tasty and refreshing and definitely a must try.

The two downsides to Hot-Star, and the reason this isn't a 5/5 review, are the long wait times and the inflated price. The original fried chicken is $9.99 (+$4.00 if you want a small drink, +$4.50 if you want a large drink)...and the cheese fried chicken is $12.99(!!!) on its own. While the chicken is large, it's also very flat and definitely not worth the high price point. It also takes about 20-30 minutes for each order, as they fry the chicken on the spot. Again, this makes for a tasty chicken-eating-experience, but waiting 30 minutes for fast food is not ideal.

Tl;dr
Try the original large fried chicken, the cheese fried chicken, and the passion fruit soda. Go when you have time to spare and be prepared to wait 20-40 mins (if you get the cheese fried chicken) for some mouth-watering crispy fried chicken!"}
{"text":"J'ai commandé un large poulet frie avec frite et un mojito pamplemousse. La portion de poulet est immense. Moyennement goûteuse mais loin d'être mauvais. Les frites à éviter absolument. Elles n'ont pas le goût de la patate. La boisson est gazeuse et peu sucré mais surtout peu goûteuse, on sent davantage le goût du citron en rondelle dans la boisson que le pamplemousse."}
{"text":"Kinda like this place. You get a MASSIVE piece of chicken for about 11 bucks. I usually barely finish the entire thing because the breading does start to feel very heavy half way through. If you are a fan of spicy food, get their original in spiciest. Unique taste that I really enjoy.

Wait time is quite long but they make it on the spot (you get it when it's HOT)."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different from my usual fried chicken so I thought this place would be appropriate. Strolled in to see a small line which I thought was great since I've heard nothing but line up horror stories. Menu was simple. I ordered the regular fried chicken. The wait for the food was about 5-10minutes given that it is cooked to order.

Was definitely shocked to see how big the piece of chicken was. Very pleased with the size considering the chicken is $10. First bite to the very last was good and crispy. Well seasoned, maybe a bit salty towards the end. Great for a first time try being in Toronto but there are better fried chicken."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try Hot Star ever since I saw a branch in HK but never got the chance to try it out.

I finally paid a visit with a friend and got the original with salt and pepper. It totally lived up to the hype - the piece of chicken they give you is giant (nearly the size of two of my hands). The outside is crunchy and seasoned nicely and the chicken is soft, tender, and incredibly juicy.

My only complaints are that it's really oily (my first bite was mostly salty oil and I drenched an entire napkin in oil just by holding my chicken) and it makes you super thirsty after you finish - make sure you have a bottle of water on hand or buy a drink. I was also under the impression it was boneless so I was surprised to find a giant chicken bone, but it's not a huge deal considering it's probably the best fried chicken I've ever had."}
{"text":"Hot Star Large Fried Chicken is a restaurant near Yonge and Gerrard. They served Taiwanese fried chicken. The seating is very limited with only five tables.

The menu is very limited. I ordered the crispy fried chicken combo #2. It came with a drink and french fries.

The fried chicken was very large and juicy. It is a big piece of chicken breast that is coated in batter. You have a choice of spiceness, but I chose mild. The French fries were okay. It took 10 minutes to get the food.

My brother enjoyed his chicken, but thought it was too greasy.

Would I go back? I doubt it. If I want fried chicken, I would rather go to Popeyes."}
{"text":"Biggest negatives were the price and wait time. I ordered the cheese stuffed chicken with fries and a passion fruit soda. I understand the cost of the chicken, it is a huge piece, but $6 for a small order of fries and a soda? The passion fruit juice is Oasis brand, which is super cheap. Overpriced. I also didn't appreciate waiting 20 mins for one meal. If it's going to take over 8 mins - you warn someone when they order, or put a sign off. I had somewhere to be and the place is set up as a fast-food style restaurant. 

Okay so the food was okay. The fried chicken was crispy with a think batter, however the cheese was stuffed in just one corner of the piece of chicken, and it just tasted weird to bite into a huge piece of melted cheese and then another just a thin bite of chicken. I was a little disappointed. I will say the fries and passion fruit soda were super delicious! 

The last thing that knocked of a star for me was the lack of service. A homeless man walked right in and starting asking every table for money. It was super uncomfortable. The cashier should have made him leave. Finally another customer gave him some change and made him leave. It was really uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Tastes just like the chicken sold in night markets in Taipei! The original large chicken is crispy, hot and delicious, but it comes with a pretty high price tag. The wait wasn't too long (practically no line and 13 orders ahead of me took about 15 minutes to get my food). My only other criticism is that the chicken isn't deboned as it is at night market, but I'll definitely be coming back for more. What a nostalgic flavour!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the worst place I have ingested crap. Adult Canadians should avoid the place. $18.00 for sub McDonalds food. Long wait, plates are apparently gauche and plastic utensils are standard fare. Again, $18.00 for really crappy food, really slow service but at least a genuinely embarrassed sweet girl behind the counter. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"This new place offers deep fried chicken by itself. Nothing else. I walked into the place seeing people each holding a paper bag with a big piece of fried chicken and they eat it like eating a burger.

At first I thought the idea was cool. I mean, who would not like eating a big fat piece of chicken? I ordered myself a piece of original crispy chicken with 'less spicy'. Their 'less spicy' option was already pretty spicy, it was perfect. The chicken was fresh off the grill and tasted great. You can see the chefs frying it through the kitchen window. I enjoyed the piece of chicken. Being able to eat a big piece chicken was very satisfying as expected.

Price wise, the piece of chicken costed me ~11 dollars after tax. I personally don't think it is that worth it. I was still kind of hungry after eating the piece of chicken and ended up getting myself bubble tea afterwards. There is an options to upgrade your chicken into a meal though which includes a drink and fries. Similar to a fast food restaurant. 

The place tastes great. But just too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Delicious Taiwanese chicken.   I will admit the chicken is very filling and I do recommend sharing...it's very delicious.   Great comfort food.  Been here a couple times and will be back for a third."}
{"text":"Don't be cheap... have more staff in the kitchen or cashier. Upgrade the debit machine maybe. Minimum 20 min to maximum 1 hour wait is nonsense especially for a restaurant that depends on a lot of take-out. Food is good. Slow and poor service though."}
{"text":"Although it is a bit pricey, it is so worth it. Chicken is cooked to perfection, very tasty. Beware the spicy IS spicy . Ate there many times in the past month and referred them to many."}
{"text":"This is a fast food chain from Taiwan. Loved it when I was Taiwan. Highly recommend it for triers. Even though the price is 5 times of Taiwan's, it won't hold me back. 
After tried it, I'd say the flavor is the same, but the batter seperated from the meat because the meat gave out so much juice. That is a differnce and I don't like it."}
{"text":"This chicken was much better than I expected. The pieces were huge, the meat was moist, and the seaweed flavor I got was very tasty. It takes a bit longer than your average fast food place to get your order, but that is because everything is made to order and piping hot. I just got original chicken, it was basically a large piece of the good stuff. Straight and to the point, love it."}
{"text":"Tips: 1.only order chicken. Dont be naive and think popeyes of any culture fix you nice drinks. 2.go early or late, or the line is crazy. 3. You can mix flavors, I got seaweed and spicy once. 

I wanted to give it 4 star because it is just fried chicken and it is so bad for you.

But heck I came to this place 3 times in a week and I still want it. Lets stop denying. I love it...

The third time I went I brought a few colleagues and they all loved it.

Too much fried chicken shortens my life, but without fried chicken, theres nothing to live for."}
{"text":"Food : 4/5 
It's fairly good

It's fairly overpriced but I don't know where else to get Taiwanese chicken nuggets other than this place. 

Service: 3/5 
The pace of service is okay, a bit of waiting."}
{"text":"Try: Classic with spicy (mild)

The chicken fillet is gigantic, decidedly bigger than my face. It was crispy, hot, and nicely flavoured. I would consider it a good treat overall.  I wonder if it's better for sharing though, given how big it is finishing one by myself felt like a major overkill. 

My friend ordered one with BBQ sauce (sprinkled with sesame) and while it's also pretty nicely flavoured, the dough became soggy and no longer crispy, which ich is the biggest draw of this food anyways!

{"text":"Ive been to hot star not too long ago and it was a pretty different experience. We felt like eating fried chicken and my girlfriend had saw some good reviews about this place, so we decided to try it out

The chicken was nice and moist with a nicely seasoned crispy batter on the outside. What makes this place unique is they dont cut the chicken, so it keeps all the natural juices inside. 

The one thing i dont like about it is they dont incorporate the spicy seasoning into the batter. They just put cayenne pepper on top, when ends up burning your lips. Also remember that the bone is inside and you done bite right into it lol

I thought the fries were expensive for the amount given, but were seasoned nicely 

The menu was pretty straight forward, but they have 2 different combos for each piece of chicken. 
This place can run you up to $15 plus tax which includes chicken, fries and a drink."}
{"text":"I went on November 14, only posting review now.

So I decided to take people's advice and go at 11am, when they first open. I waited outside at around 10:50am, they were nice enough to let people in as it was cold (+1 point for customer service).

The actual ordering didn't start until 11:10am, I wasn't sure why, it seems like the till is connected and stuff. Once I ordered, I waited about 20 minutes for my fried chicken - while there was a line for pickup as well, it's based on order #.

The food itself: I always like Taiwanese fried popcorn chicken, i got the same seasoning, salt & pepper, the chicken was very fresh (I didn't finish all of it at once, the latter part is just the bone, so nothing to eat there). The fried part reminds me of chicken katsu. I also got the drink - curacao pop, I brought the food and drink home to eat, but the pop exploded, luckily nothing was spilled. They don't cut the meat for you, so I had to do it myself."}
{"text":"One of the best fried chicken I've had. I am a little wary when ordering chicken breast because it's cooked to dryness but this chicken was incredibly juicy. 
They season the chicken just right and it is very flavourful. 
It truly is a huge portion and well worth the money. I was super full after eating the original large chicken with spicy seasoning and milk tea. It is a lot of fried chicken to eat so maybe if you're just looking for a snack, split it with a friend. 
You wouldn't think it would feel like a meal but it is. 
Needs more seating areas though and maybe some sides that would offset the fried food. 
Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"I heard this Taiwanese chicken chain with a real good reputation was coming to Toronto, so I decided to see what the fuss was first hand.

So far I am in line to order and have not received my food yet, what a good time to start my Yelp review.

The line up outside was immensely long. Perhaps all those who grew up with this chain got really excited and have decided to come down.

I haven't ordered yet but I thing this will not be disappointing from what I have seen so far.  The fillet is an actual chicken breast with bone in! Eat your heart out North American fast food chains!

The flavours com in original, specialty bbq, and crispy.  For today only the original is available. They also have popcorn chicken.  I will order the original and the popcorn chicken. I have not eaten since breakfast and it is now 2:00pm. 

The operation itself is clean and modern, the employees even wear surgical masks!

Another 10 minutes at least before I get my food, I hope it lives up to the hype.

Okay, so every order is made on order, nothing here is prepared ahead of time and it is delicious, crispy, tender, juicy and hell yah worth the wait.

This is a grand slam.

{"text":"4 stars. Probably the best fried chicken I have ever had in my life.  I ordered the original medium spicy which actually has a lot of kick, (you can choose your level of spice) The chicken itself was moist, juicy and flavourful.  Yes, the wait times are a little long but every piece of chicken is made to order.  I asked the server the what the difference was between the original and crispy and the crispy is fried longer and coated with extra batter, which makes sense to me.  This chicken is definitely better than KFC and actually the price (approximately $10 before taxes for the original is reasonable, as it will fill you up)."}
{"text":"The large chicken steak is actually a piece of chicken breast on bone. It was well cooked, tasty and moist.

A little pricey though."}
{"text":"I also came to this place after reading the BlogTO post. Used to be Sushi Tower and now its a  Taiwanese Fried Chicken place.

Omg $10 for a piece of chicken?!!? Yeah the piece was kind of big and you get a free pop, but it's still pretty fricken expensive. On opening day, I thought there would be promos/specials going on but guess not. Was planning to try their popcorn chicken but it was already sold out, plus they didn't have everything on their menu out yet. So basically, everyone had to get the same fried chicken. They have different seasonings and my friend and I both got salt and pepper. When we got it, it was crispy, hot, and still fresh!

They should really organize their pickup/ordering system better though. Yeah opening day and the line was pretty long and things get pretty hectic, but I could really do without a Chinese lady yelling out the number order lol.

Every time there is a spelling error or typical Chinese grammar on the wall, I cringe a little.

Not sure I'll be back but it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"They've started putting more popcorn chicken in the bag, you guys."}
{"text":"The Spicy Original Chicken is probably one of the best deep fried chicken! Go early to avoid lines! The wait is not so bad and it is really worth it. It is so big that it is bigger than my face which is really interesting. I just wish that they were open later then it would be the greatest late night eat in Downtown core."}
{"text":"At the size of my friend's head, they don't call it LARGE Fried Chicken for nothing! Visited around 2pm and way after the initial hype died down, so thankfully there were no lines. I got the Original Fried Chicken which was so generously coated in seaweed that it was green, and I liked that it was more mild compared to the other spicier seasonings. The chicken itself was made to order - crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Really good, but the portion was so big it was a struggle to finish. The ends also had a thicker crust. It'd be awesome if they had smaller orders but there's a sign saying that they don't cut orders in half so I'm guessing a few people have had this issue."}
{"text":"What an excellent Thursday to have a walk around Toronto Eaton Centre ... As I'm walking back home for dinner I smell fried chicken.  Wait, this is NOT your regular KFC, it has Chinese characters written all over it.  It reads \"big big Chicken rib\" umm ok, chicken usually not known for their ribs. So I went in to see what they have.

Looking over the menu, I ended up order the original fried chicken breast! And oh my, they aren't kidding. This break is large! I can easily put both my hands together and it's not as big as the piece of chicken breast.  

It was super fresh! You can get it with no spice or mild, medium or hot. If you are into chicken, you gotta try it out. The spices on it is blend'ish, but it's refreshing from the salty KFCs out there!

{"text":"It tastes like Taipei. I love Taipei. 
But nothing else about it is like Taipei. The staff are unfriendly and not taiwanese, the price is a bit ridiculous, their popcorn chicken isnt that good, but their giant friend chicken chops are every bite like Taipei. 

So yes, four stars, in spite of everything i don't like about it, because taste of taipei night market is everything.

Oh, and there are no lines anymore, but the wait is still pretty long."}
{"text":"Tried this on the recommendation of a co worker, it's $15 with the chicken and drink.

I got the original batter with pepper salt and the passion fruit drink. The chicken itself is very good very juicy, the best part of it believe it or not is near the bone. The size of the chicken is enormous which can easily feed two people, but they don't really provide any utensils other than a fork so sharing is difficult unless you bring your own knife. 

The drink is nothing special tasted like pineapple Sumol ( a Portuguese drink) 

Service is alright when I went it wasn't busy so I got my chicken in around 10 mins which wasn't bad and the chicken came out piping hot and fresh. The worker there could be a little more polite tho.

Value wise it's expensive @$15, so this will probably be a very infrequent thing for me as there are better  fried chicken places out there with better value.."}
{"text":"As I was walking on Yonge street, I saw a  big blue sign with the words \"Fried Chicken\" caught my attention so I stopped to see that it was a Taiwanese fried chicken shop. Intrigued - I came back a few days for lunch on Friday:

Location/Decor:
- It is located few mins south of Gerrard on Yonge Street and you can't miss the the light blue store front
- We came on Fri for lunch right at 12 which didn't have a lineup at all. However, after about 10-15 mins, huge crowd formed a long line up inside the store.
- Inside, it is very modern and clean looking but space wise, there is not much seating. We ended taking this back to the office to eat. Probably ok for 2-4 people but for larger groups, take away is probably best.

Food:
- I liked the menu concept - it is straight forward and simple menu with a few options. Basically, you order your chicken then fries and a drink.
- For chicken, you can order their original style (GIANT NUGGET!!! :)), fried chicken and popcorn chick. For fries, they have regular fries and sweet potatoe wedges (or thats what they looked like). Finally, for drinks, they have regular pop and some sort of iced drinks. There are items coming like BBQ flavoured chicken, fried mushrooms.
- So we ordered 2 original chicken orders, one with pepper and salt while the other was spicy.
- Wow - we were super impressed by the size as it is probably the size of a sheet of paper!!!. Coating was thin and crispy while also not being very oily (very good thing!). Inside the chicken was flavourful, moist and tasty. It resembles a huge chicken schnitzel! All in all - a great tasty lunch!. Size-wise, you could probably share one between 2 people however there is a bony part at the bottom - it is funny as it almost acts as the handle! 

In general, if you have a craving for fried chicken, I think this hits the spot. There were also a seaweed flavour which I will probably check out next time."}
{"text":"I went a couple weeks ago during their soft opening so their menu was very limited, not sure if that's changed. I got the original chicken cutlet in salt & pepper. Although it was pretty tender and well-seasoned, I don't think it was worth around $11 and a 20 minute wait... There are plenty of other food options available in the area so I would suggest going elsewhere if the lineup is particularly long."}
{"text":"Had the wings, spicy pop corn chicken and mushrooms.  The wait is long, as it is made upon order and price is quite steep.

Nothing new from my last review."}
{"text":"My curiosity finally got the best of me, and my parents and I went to try it out. We got the original large hot star fried chicken to share. 

I'll preface to say, that the first bite was great, the breading was thick and tasty and the chicken was tender and juicy. 

However when we divvied up the chicken into 3 pieces, while my parents got chicken that was good and fully cooked, the piece I got was green. Literally, the meat was green coloured. Also i had the part with a bone. 

If you eat this while it's hot, it is quite tasty but after it cools down, it's not nearly as appetizing, and the fact that there was green meat, that I wouldn't have seen had I not split it with my parents... Kind of turned me off from coming back..."}
{"text":"Came back after a year. Although I am fan of their chicken, it is too pricey for one piece of large chicken.

Comparing to my experience I had a year before, I was surprised that the size of the chicken is bigger now. It's even bigger than my face. 

I ordered the Seaweed and Extra Spicy Original Chicken. The taste is still the same. It's crispy and juicy. Last time I had they put seaweed power on one side and chili powder on the other side. I like that way better since this time they put them all in one side so I could only taste the spicy powder. I wish I could enjoy the seaweed more. 

Overall, I had a good meal. There was no lineup, but I still had to wait for more than 5 minutes to get the chicken. That's fine to me because I know they freshly fried them when I ordered. 

I would recommend this place if you like fried chicken. It's worth a try. I hope they could bring the price down a bit then I would be a regular customer. Again, totally recomend!"}
{"text":"They ran out at 8pm on a weekday. The next time the wait was about 20 minutes from ordering. The Chicken portions are large. The batter was crispy but had an odd oily smell. Won't be going here again."}
{"text":"This might be one of the best fried chickens in Toronto. The seasoning makes it actually addicting. Every time I walk by I am tempted to get some. 
If it's your first time, I highly recommend ordering the Original Fried Chicken. Its what makes this place so incredible. 
I have also tried the popcorn chicken, once with the regular seasoning, another time with the spicy seasoning. Both times have been amazing. My preference is the regular seasoning on everything but i you life spicy they spicy is really good too. 
Everything is so full of flavor. 
The shop is really cute too. It's tiny with a few places to sit if you'd like to enjoy your fried chicken there. There's usually a bit of a line when ordering. Also they make it right there when you order it so you're always getting it fresh."}
{"text":"Hot Star is apparently this huge popular chain restaurant in Taiwan and is the next big thing in Toronto that has people willing to line up for hours. I went just before noon on a Sunday and was pleasantly surprised to find there was no line outside... didn't realize there was a substantial line inside the actual shop (it's decently spacious, not as cramped as Uncle Tetsu's, so that's nice), so all in all the wait took me about half an hour. They're pretty efficient and only let you order one item per person, so bring some friends if you want to try multiple things.

Obviously their main thing is the giant piece of breaded chicken ($9.99+tax), which comes in three flavours: salt and pepper, spicy, and seaweed. I ordered the salt and pepper flavour and shared it with a friend for lunch because it is HUGE... don't think I would be able to finish a whole one by myself, honestly. It comes out very hot and fresh and is delicious... lightly seasoned (not too salty), crispy and lightly breaded, and the chicken is soooo moist and juicy. I really enjoyed it, but didn't think the flavour was super unique (Bar Fancy chicken still holds my heart.) While I don't think I would be willing to line up for a long time for this, if it was about another half hour wait I would like to come back and try the seaweed flavour! This place is definitely going to be a hit with fried chicken lovers."}
{"text":"Okay I'm sure if I had just come from Taiwan and was craving the as close to experience experience..I'd love this place, but the ginormous hammered out cutlets that are larger than your face are insanity...Possibly the good kind of insanity but still.  Flavour was great and the drink was oddly tasty (green apple with Yakult). Yakult is something u love if you grew up with it I think.  Personally liked the ease of eating the popcorn chicken and loved the king mushrooms.  Worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Let's just say if it's your first time trying the place, don't make the same mistake that I've made and just order no toppings for the original taste. I got the medium spicy with seaweed and I feel like the chicken was over salted and rolled in instant noodle mix. Adding extra spice doesn't make it spicier but just more salty. Even if the chicken was plain, it was just okay, the value for the price isn't that great. It's worth the novelty of trying it out though."}
{"text":"Hot-Star opened its first location on the corner of Yonge & Gerrard in late 2015. They're a popular chain from Taiwan offering large fried chicken. They got their start at the Shi-Lin Night Market in Taipei, and has since expanded internationally with several overseas locations. 

The item is essentially an oversized crispy chicken coated in batter and made to order. I liked that I was able to customize the spice level, but it was only on one side. I am not sure if you are able to ask for it to be coated on both sides, but that'd be nice. Since they use chicken breast (boned-in), the chicken was pretty juicy and moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. Although the original was tasty, their new  Hot Cheese Fried Chicken was a lot better in my opinion. Things just taste better with cheese! Get the cheese one unless you're lactose intolerant, of course. 

The blue curacao yogurt drink complemented well with the fried chicken. I only got it cause it looked pretty, but it ended up tasting pretty good. 

The popcorn chicken was really good and quickly devoured by our table. I'd get it again as a snack. Wings were only decent though. While the fried king oyster mushroom was good, the portion was super small for the price. Not really worth the price, so I'd skip it. I am actually going to Taiwan for one week next year (April 2018), so I'll be sure to check out Hot-Star at one of the night markets there just to compare."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a piece of chicken that was so tender, moist, and savory that you just can't stop eating?  This was it for me.  I shared with a friend (tip: bring your own plastic knife) and while I wished I had my own, it was probably for the best as I probably couldn't eat the entire thing on my own.  My stomach isn't quite as ambitious as my eyes (and tastebuds).  

I got the regular and it was very flavorful (had a 5 spice thing going on).  

Also, its best to eat it fresh.  A couple weeks later, I got one to go and while I re-heated it and was tasty....it was not as crispy."}
{"text":"A few things I will not kick out of my bed, fried chicken is one. I am not big on \"junk\" food. However, if I indulge, I go all out. 

Hot Star Large Fried Chicken is LARGE. It also comes with a LARGE price tag. However, I was very impressed by delicious fried large chicken and popcorn chicken. My review may be completely bias as I adore popcorn chicken. My birthday last year was a celebration of the Taiwanese culture; bubble tea and popcorn chicken or  PPCC-BBT (for short). Instead of wining and dining, my vision of an ideal date is PPCC-BBT. 

Freshly fried chicken is always late but worth the wait. If you ask me to choose between freshly fried chicken under the heat lamp VS waiting for 15 minutes for freshly fried chicken out of the fryer, I would choose the latter. The large chicken was succulent. It was crispy on the outside and was thick and juicy on the inside. Spicy popcorn chicken was equally sinful. The heat added an extra layer of flavour-bomb to the crispy exterior.  

Simple menu, fried to perfection! Be sure to pop inside for popcorn chicken!"}
{"text":"If there's 2 of you and you don't mind sharing (like mouth on chicken sharing or bring your own scissors or knife if that's not weird), just get one chicken cutlet. They're big and it's pretty greasy, so after eating half, I was good. 

What can I say that everyone else hasn't said? It's tasty! Good fried chicken."}
{"text":"Was with a friend and we thought we will try it seeing people walk out with huge pieces of chicken,,
Evaluation:
 Yes, this is a huge piece of fried chicken but unlike any of the others it has a soft crisp batter and is soft and tender on the inside. I  only purchased the chicken piece and got the  Seaweed flavour ,my friend got the Spicy flavour. 
The seaweed flavor was flavorful and a pleasure to enjoy . Its a must try . The spicy flavor was  a disappointment  without any spice. It was more a basic flavor than anything resembling a spice. You are better off trying seaweed or original .
Drinks
They have some interesting drinks. There is passion fruit soda, blue curacao yogurt and an apple yogurt.   My friend got the passion fruit soda and said it was very good
Ill definitely be back  one more time to try their popcorn chicken and the blue curacao yogurt  drink. I have not tried the passion fruit  , but the blue curacao sounds unusual and  seems worth a try
The place is worth 1-2 visits but not  more than that since there are so many  new things to try in Toronto."}
{"text":"The order which took 15-20min was rather greasy and half was full of bone,definitely not worth that price because I was able only to eat half. I wish I knew about the bones in which case I would stay away. it says 100% chicken breast which meant white boneless fillet meat my whole life and the dripping grease/oil I could live with but I am not a gnawer and never eat anything with bones. had to give half to husband who wasn't amazed by the meal either. sorry to the owner who seems to read and reply to everyhing but I was really disappointed like I wasn't for some time and this is just my honest opinion on it. You should get rid of the bones or mention it so people know whether to spend their $30 or not."}
{"text":"This is a great take out place for quick food but it was definitely very expensive. After paying over $20, we got a seasoned piece of pork chops, fries and a club soda mixed with fruit flavouring. I thought it was nice to try but I'm not jumping to go back anytime soon. The flavours to choose from are seaweed, salt and pepper and spicy. You can choose a range of spicy options and I went with medium. 

It was not very filling, good to try though I think that is the extent of this establishment."}
{"text":"Went there with my girlfriend. The chicken is literally the size of my face and it tastes great! The wait time for the chicken is a little bit long though."}
{"text":"Worst experience 
Don't go there during peak hours, the person at the cashier was super slow, it took her around 3 minutes to order for one person, so I waited for like half an hour before I could actually place the order and I was already starving!!!!!  Never seen such low efficiency!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best fried chicken places I've been to. There service is quick and friendly. The chicken is tasty and succulent, definitely worth the hype. My only recommendation would be that they start using the seasoning in the actual batter, no dusting the top. the way it is now you get too much seasoning some times and not enough others. 

All in all - it is tasty. At $9 for just the regular chicken with the 20% I'm not sure this is somewhere I would come regularly but would come back"}
{"text":"Reliably juicy and crispy fried chicken, with the signature Taiwanese taste of 5 spice. I've had the original fried chicken, which is massive, and the popcorn chicken, which I prefer and tend to get. 

It takes a while to get your food and it's not cheap if you compare it to North American fried chicken chains, but I think it's worth it because they make your food fresh to order and they really deliver on that authentic Taiwanese flavour. 

I'm not a fan of the drinks, but after having fried chicken, I find it's a nice walk to either one of the Chatimes nearby to wash it down!"}
{"text":"Awesome fried chicken if you like chicken. I got the medium spice... I actually took 2 days to finish by warming up my left over the next day- still delish!"}
{"text":"Food is fine, close enough to the real Taiwanese chicken chops.  

However...

OVERPRICED! 
OVERPRICED!
OVERPRICED!
OVERPRICED!
OVERPRICED!
OVERPRICED!

I know you can't compare the price to Taiwan, but come on! $10 for a piece of pounded out chicken breast???

Also, wait time is way too long, and they won't take phone orders.  So... with the price and the wait, they won't get much of my business.  Oh and the service is quite meh~~~"}
{"text":"I've heard of Taiwanese fried chicken before but never had the opportunity to try it. I'm glad my friend suggested we meet up here. You get a lot of chicken for your $10! It would probably be best to share this with someone else. I had a tough time finishing my piece of chicken. 

I would definitely go again and perhaps order the second level of spice and share with someone who likes spicy food and order the fries as well."}
{"text":"Um... this place was a little different.  You basically get a big piece of spiced chicken in a bag.  The actual piece was huge.  I'm pretty full, and I didn't get any fries or anything else.  Just the chicken.  
But like others have mentioned before me... the wait is significant.  I think we waited probably 25 or 30 minutes for our chicken to be ready.  I am glad I went and glad I tried it.  I did enjoy eating it, but I will probably not be back.  There are many more places that I would like to go to.  
So... was okay.  Is a different kind of thing to try, but I would not go back.  I can't point out anything particularly wrong other than the wait times, I was just not WOW'd."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! Sometimes I just crave some fried chicken goodness and this place definitely delivered that. For just over $10, you can get a huge piece of fried chicken served in a paper bag. It's super simple, reasonably priced, and delicious! I tried the original recipe and also the cheese stuffed one. Loved both. The cheese stuffed one was definitely a favourite and I'll be getting this one every time going forward - the cheese was super gooey and stringy with every bite - definitely worthy of a boomerang for Instagram. I do feel that the chicken can be a little bit bigger for what you pay for (I was still hungry afterwards) - but that might just be me. Maybe I'll order 2 the next time :\"D"}
