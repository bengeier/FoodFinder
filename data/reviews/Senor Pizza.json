{"text":"Pizza is great!  Wings are great! This place is great!  Today will be my fourth visit and each time has been delicious and very quick.  Glad we have a great pizza place like this near me."}
{"text":"I've ate at this location 3 times and I've been happy each time the owner is very friendly and I'm glad to another great family owned business in south Phoenix. 

I recommend the Hawaiian pizza it's really good and loaded with pineapple, and a boat load of cheese, I've yet to try la paisana pizza it looks and sounds really good I will be sure to try it and write a review regarding it.

Support your local business and think outside the box"}
{"text":"Pizza it's four stars and if i could add half more i would because their price is very reasonable, great service and love their chicken and pizza combo!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and delicious.  I ordered the Baseline 2 which comes with 2 large one topping pizzas, dozen wings, and a cold 2 liter soda for less than $25. The pizza was great in  taste and cheesy,  you can taste the fresh dough."}
{"text":"Been here few times never disappointed awesome food awesome service!! Staff/owner very welcoming will keep coming back...Thanks Senor Pizza"}
{"text":"The Pizza was definitely good. Wings were ehhh. Service was terrible. Definitely can tell this is family owned, and the cashier was the spoiled son who will not be fired cause he's \"Mama's Baby\". More in tuned with whatever social media app he was possibly using in his phone rather than checking on the customer. I will not be returning here when i move to Phoenix"}
{"text":"Classic family-owned and operated pizzaria at its best. Don't let the small store front fool you. Great tasting pizza and hot wings. A southwestern styled pizza made to order. Stop by and get to know this family. Eat inside or take it to go. You owe it to yourself to try it."}
{"text":"Good pizza, orders the works. Figured it had normal toppings. It had chorizo on it. Was awesome. Will order from again."}
{"text":"Tried to order two pizzas. Tried to explain what I wanted 4 times. Girl on the phone tried to add wings to order. When I said I did not want wings she hung up on me. Ordered somewhere else. 20 min later called me that pizza was ready. Told them sorry but ordered from another company with a clue. Owner responded I did not mention order. Since girl on phone Hugh up on me there was never an order. Work on your customer service and maybe these reviews will be better"}
{"text":"i was not impress it was really salty and dought was grease, chicken wings were really salty,"}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place the last couple of years and finally decided to try it given my love for small biz. Unfortunately, my husband and I were disappointed. We decided to try the La Mexican, and I was really hoping the chirzo was going to give it extra flare. When we opened the box it looked like we got sausage. I didn't see chirzo or ground beef, and the toppings were pretty bare. Most importantly, the crust tasted frozen. The one shiny thing about the food were the wings, they were cooked perfectly. Strangely, they were really small. Wish I could say I would go back, but I'm the only one in the family that has an itch for wings and I don't get them often."}
{"text":"Here for a week on vacation and we were craving for pizza. Got a great deal on pizza, wings, and drink. The food was fabulous. I would recommend it. The staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Heard its great.  would love to see a online menu and your delivery area.  we are on Baseline and 7th Ave.  do you have wings too?"}
{"text":"Pizza was a great value. Was made quick. Now, the wings...they were the best that I have had in a LOOONG time. Perfect! 

Place was clean, wish they had better signage, hard to see the location."}
{"text":"It's easy to miss this place, but the pizza is great!!  My family and friends loved it."}
{"text":"HIGHLY IMPRESSED.  I've passed this place for over a year underestimating what great pizza you could get from it.  So finally I went online and looked it up when I had a taste for \"pie\".  I first noticed how affordable the prices were.  You could get a decent size pizza for about $12.  Thought it was too good to be true.. boy was I wrong!

I wanted the La Carnitas since I'm a meat lovers fan.  Called in the order in advance and they said it would be ready in 15 minutes.  I got there and the pizza was certainly ready.  The cashier also advised that they deliver.. which I didn't know beforehand.  Pizza smelled great and I was ready to get home and indulge.

There was so much flavor and they didn't skimp on the toppings.  Every bite made me want more of this awesome pizza!  I certainly will be going back and next time I hope to try the great looking wings."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way to South Mountain, and was welcomed by the owner, David. He was very friendly and welcoming and the large pepperoni pizza was only $5 with delicious garlic Parmesan crust!! Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Check out Se√±or Pizza! I've been here a few times and the pizza and wings are delicious! They have a bunch of different flavors though my favorites are the \"chili\" and \"teriyaki\"! They have excellent specials and deals throughout the week! I'd definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"From out of town and was looking for local pizza place.  Found this place.  Great pizzas and wings.  Owner was very nice, very clean."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight. We ordered the pepperoni pizza, Buffalo wings medium heat and Honey BBQ wings.. we found a new favorite place. Price was reasonable and the food was delicious. The owner was very kind. We will be back for more.. Great location in South Phx.."}
{"text":"A great little local spot for pizza I finally got to checkout after seeing a review on Nextdoor from some of the neighbors.

Called up and got a La Piasan and some wings. The pizza was pretty solid but for me i like it a little on the crisper side and with a touch more sauce. What was really nice is we asked for half without the olives and bell peppers and they got it right and double checked to make sure it was right. Too often special orders like that get ignored.

My favorite part however was the wings. They were so good with a great amount of breading on them. Not entirely sure how they cook them  (maybe in the pizza oven) but there was a nice grilled flavor in them. The flavor was really good and not just the standard wing sauce it actually had flavor to match the heat. The heat however was pretty high for medium wings they were closer to a hot most places so watch out for that. 

For me the standout beyond just the wings being good is that they make their own blue cheese and add some real gorgonzola to it. Makes for a much fresher dip that has more of the bite of the cheese which went well with the spice of the wings.

The service was great and the owner was super nice and very friendly. This is a great little locally owned spot with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I came here tonight after seeing these reviews. I got a half pepperoni/half cheese pizza for only $5! It was very fresh and honestly the best $5 pizza I've ever had. I've had Little Caesars and Hungry Howies. I will probably come here every Friday for a really good $5 pizza from now on. 

Seriously, why would anyone go to Little Caesars when they could support this local business and get a better flavor pizza?!"}
{"text":"Very good piia and the wings, were very very good! We will certainly be back! Senior Pizza himself waited on us, what a super nice guy, and really passionate about his food and customer service!  What a fantastic place with so many options. There are even ribs and beans being offered!"}
{"text":"I love this place - great pizza and excellent wings. Love the red chili flavored wings !! Great customer service!!  I will be coming back soon !!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great location. The owner was very sweet as well. The pizza was very delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is great local owned business that has great food and friendly staff one of my new favorite pizza spots a must try"}
{"text":"Is this an old Hungry Howie's?  The inside is pretty bad and the pizza was not very good which I should have guessed from nobody in the place.   While I waited for 10 minutes the phone didn't ring once!  And this was a weekend night.  It was greasy and I don't think they even put any marinara sauce on mine.  Three stars is generous.  Also, is their logo Moe from the Three Stooges?  This place was all around confusing and passable."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and wings and budget friendly , mom and pop family owned pizzeria  , pizza combo 2 pizzas , dozen wings and a 2 liter of soda $21! Owners are very friendly and welcoming"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place I've been to in AZ . There are all really nice , food was done fast . And the food is AMAZING. I will keep going there  !!!"}
{"text":"I was having Friday night fat kid cravings so I yelped a pizza place for a late night snack. Based on the reviews, I made a call to Senor Pizza. 22 minutes later I had pizza, wings and ice cold coke at my door. Not only was my food great but the service was top shelf. I called late and they still treated me great. Most places would have told me no, it's too late for delivery etc.. they did not and because of that, they have a customer for life. The pizza was great and If you like wings, try them here, you won't be disappointed. Give this family owned business a try. South Phoenix is lucky to have them."}
{"text":"Awesome local spot with reasonable prices and great pizza! It reminded me of Papa Johns but the atmosphere was much better. The owner David really makes you feel like family and works hard to satisfy his customers! If you're looking to try something new don't hesitate to check them out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"My family and I just recently moved to the area and we were in need of a reliable pizza option where the taste and service was consistent. This place definitely checked both boxes. 1 large pepperoni, 1 2L of soda and a dozen wings for $20.63 out the door. Got Parmesan cheese and ranch on the side, not sure if it was extra or not. After ordering a couple times from here, there's no need to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Check out this local pizza spot, it's a must eat. I ordered the LA Mexicana it has Ground beef, Chorizo, red onions, green bell peppers, Jalape√±o & Chile chipotle. It was amazing had a great taste."}
{"text":"Don't live very convenient to here. After tonight I wish I did. Been dying to try it out after seeing the Yelp feedback. Was finally passing by tonight at a good time to pick up for dinner. 

Process was fast, friendly and efficient. Extremely pleasant  when I arrived for pick up. 

Smelling it all the way home was unbearable. Wife, kids and myself are now hooked. 

The La Hawaiana was particularly awesome. Double ham, double cheese and double pineapple as advertised. Excellent pizza. Also had pepperoni one and just cheese for the kids. 

Will be back. Worth my wait before I got to go and now wish I was over there more."}
{"text":"The customer service over the phone ordering a pizza was absolutely terrible. I tried to order two pizzas, a meat lovers and an Alfredo with bacon and the person attempting to take my order didn't know what. A meat lovers pizza was... A meat lovers pizza the most basic of pizza besides cheese and pepperoni. After the about ten minutes of talking the person through it over the phone I asked them to repeat my order and after all this work she hung up on me. Some of the worst service I have had."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've had! And the guy who runs it is super polite and friendly to talk to! I'd give it 10 stars if I could"}
{"text":"Very nice local business. The owner was very friendly and welcoming. The pizzas start at $5 and it was way better than getting a $5 pizza from Lil Ceasar's. Would definitely recommend eating here for a cheap but good quality meal with friends and family."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my experience did not live up to some of these other reviews. It just didn't taste fresh.  Also the wings were extremely soggy and mushy.   Bummed I was excited to try it based on some of the other experiences.


(I'm sure it was made to order.  I think maybe it just wasn't cooked all the way or something - it's hard to say - It just could have better.

As I said - I just wasn't blown away, I may give your place another shot but it was no better than a little Cesar's pizza."}
{"text":"The wings are great!  Make sure you're hungry because they're meaty.  Haven't tried the pizza but that Mexican themed toppings plus the awesome wings would bring me back for sure."}
{"text":"Great pizza, quick and hot!  Double cheese is STANDARD!  If you want carry out or eat in (tho seating is limited), this is your go-to place!  We like the Hawaiian with sausage added. Yum!  Family-owned, not a chain. Lovely, friendly owners, too!"}
{"text":"This place is a 5 in customer service but the food was okay. I would eat there again if I was really hungry but there is a lot more places with better wings and pizza. We ordered the \"La Mexicana\" the toppings were great but it was lacking pizza sauce, making it a bit dry. I was expecting more on the wings, I made sure I asked for well done and super spicy, the owner guaranteed it would be super spicy \"ay mamacita! spicy\" The wings tasted like frozen extra breaded wings. Not sure if they had a naked wing option, I would of preferred that. The owner made up for the ok food, he was super nice and had great energy! Always looking to support local businesses and the place was really clean and food delivery was fast. Would go back if they have a naked wing option and to try the other pizza but I will make sure to ask for extra sauce on my pizza."}
{"text":"I'm a pizza lover, so finding a delicious affordable pizza is hard.But se√±or pizza is AMAZING! The customer service is phenomenal as well. Please support your local businesses!"}
