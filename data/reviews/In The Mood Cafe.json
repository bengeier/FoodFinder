{"text":"Cute family run place, very neat and clean. Loved the Cuban Panini's the pork was fresh out of of the oven and very juicy and full of flavor. The empanadas were unique and tasty, eat them there fresh so you get a nice crunch to the pastry like shells. We came back the next day for breakfast burritos and were not disappointed, they were very fresh tasting, best I've had in a long time. Took some Howling Brownie ice cream home and was extremely impressed with the quality. My wife and I are sorry it took us so long to find this place, yet it is so close and convenient, especially for take out. Looking forward to trying more things there!"}
{"text":"The best homemade ice cream!  And the staff is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this restaurant in the Matthews/Indian Trail area!  It's located in the same complex as Poppyseed Bagels, but on the opposite side of Harris Teeter.   They have a nice mix of breakfast (which is served ALL DAY) and lunch/light dinner foods.   I ordered a Mushroom Swiss Burger and the mushrooms were very flavorful. It came with a side of house cut fries.  My daughter chose scrambled eggs and bacon--and she ate every last crumb!  My son would eat chicken tenders/nuggets and fries at every meal, if I let him. He was very impressed too. I suppose he is a Connoisseur at this point!   They make everything fresh and I'd love to go back to try their salads and soups. The panini's sound delicious too--especially the Cuban and the Chicken Pesto. Yum!   ....and then there's the ICE CREAM! They had about a dozen flavors and were happy to offer samples to help us make up our minds! They had all the favorites (chocolate, cookies n cream, vanilla, strawberry) as well as some unique options (banana cream pie, Brownie, a pretzel/caramel flavor). Very tasty homemade ice cream!   The prices were reasonable. I enjoyed my burger much more than those at Highway 55--plus there were so many more options at In the Mood!   With summer here, it's a nice option for a meal out with the kids or a new favorite ice cream spot."}
{"text":"All I have to say is- Best homemade ice cream! Searched this place up after craving some homemade ice cream and boy was I impressed! Staff was friendly and they all took pride in just doing what they do in there! Cant wait to try their other treats that they offer! I live 10 miles away but will do the drive!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  This is exactly what a diner is supposed to be.   Now the best burgers, fries, Panini's, and hands down best ice cream is in the same shopping center as the best bagels from Matthews to Indian Trail. Super friendly family of transplanted northerners always make my wife and I feel welcomed and we always leave with a full belly.  Everything is fresh and made in house. I had the Moody burger with cheddar and bacon on a brioche bun and home cut fries and it was better than anything you could ever hope for at a backyard barbecue.  I can recall the flavor ice cream I got in a cake cone, but it contained Butterfingers and chocolate chips and it was some kind of good.   Next time I go it'll either BR for breakfast or a milkshake."}
{"text":"My friend and I met here today because all our other breakfast spots in the area have been exhausted (basically they are just plain gross).    I'm so glad that we came here because the staff was friendly and thoughtful and just plain great.  My friend and I both had the egg and cheese panini which was delicious hot and she got the home fries.  In all my life I have never had a home fry such as these.  The right consistency, the right mix of peppers, onions and potatoes and to top it off, a wonderful blend of spices.    Now that you know the food is food is great, the prices are really reasonable too.    Go, go, go!!!"}
{"text":"I love the food!! It's a great place to eat, it sometimes takes Alittle bit longer for your food but other than that I love it! Best salads!!!"}
{"text":"We went again to the cafe for lunch. The food is decent and the ice cream is excellent but getting service in a timely manner is tough. The 2 owners are the only ones I have ever seen working there so service is super, super slow each time we go in. We were the only patrons in the restaurant so it should have been faster. It's a diner, not fine dining. For this type of restaurant I expect quick, hot, good food at reasonable prices. We've been twice and the food is good enough and it's hot. The prices are average but are higher than a similar, also close by, American style diner called Highway 55. Despite the delicious homemade ice cream I doubt this restaurant will be open long. :("}
{"text":"Love the chopped salads. Everything is fresh and made to order. Homemade ice cream is amazing."}
