{"text":"Delightfully decorated place, great food and cozy homey and yet professional service. And the view!"}
{"text":"Most beautiful location.  The food was great.  I had salmon with orange sauce.   The salmon was done perfectly.  My friend had a veal dish and he was equally pleased with his meal.   One of the better restaurants on the area."}
{"text":"A cold April Saturday night, off season. Cosy & warm inside. Italian coutryside kitch decor with a lot of tchotchkes & wine botlles all over the place.  The owner greets us kindly and shows us to our table. Cracks a well placed joke when he comes by soon after with a tasty \"bouchée\" to keep our taste buds occupied while we scan the menu.  Service was cheerful and courteous.   Appetizer: I had the mussels in a mustard, cream and wine sauce. My wife had the tomato & bocconccini salad. Both were excellent, the salad was much more elegant than I expected and presentation was also carefully crafted - quite beautiful.  Main:   I ordered the spaghetti carbonnara... my favourite italian pasta dish of which I've become quite the expert. I can't resist comparing these in all italian restaurants I go to. This one is authentic - not just bacon added to an alfredo sauce. This is authentic pancetta with egg yolks, as carbonnara should be. And must be spaghetti, not linguini! The portion was quite generous and the shape of the bowl kept the pasta hot up until the last delicious bite. I added a little salt and pepper to my personnal taste. Fresh parmesan was offered, but not necessary for my taste. As authentic carbonnara's go, this one rates 8.5/10.  My wife ordered a veal scallopini dish in rosé & white wine sauce with accompanying grilled vegetables (instead of offered pasta). The vegetables were perfectly cooked: just the right side of firm and hot. Tasty as well. The veal sauce was delicate (very little tomato) which was appreciated by my wife. Had zing and not sweet. Portion was reasonnable but by no means \"american sized\".  We had not time left for desert as this was a pre-movie supper. Notwithstanding, my wife got the crème brulée and green tea while we asked for the check at the same time. Crème brulée is not presented in the typical french ramkin with the scorched crust, but rather lightly caramalized top in an open dish. Tested of crème brulée: no surprise there.  6h30 pm reservation, out the door at 8h00 pm.   We would return here gladly. The summer terrace must be great (facing the lake). Authentic italian comfort food, fairly priced."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and spectacular food and service! The owner greeted us and spoke to us for a few minutes and was extremely warm and friendly. The food was fresh, homemade, and superb. My sister had dietary allergies and they were very accommodating. Good for a romantic date night or for families! Our favorite dish we ordered was the fettuccini Alfredo and the penne Romanov. We also got homemade coconut chocolate mouse cake for dessert. Everything was delectable and we loved the location, ambiance and service."}
{"text":"Location: In Ste. Adèle, right by the lake. There's public parking right next to the restaurant that you can use.   The place: It's of a decent size and offers a fairly large terrace that has a view of the lake. The decor could use a bit of freshening up - it's a little old-school and it's actually pretty dim in the main portion of the restaurant.   The service: OK, well first off, the owner's reception was cool. In addition, he spent most of the night chatting up what appeared to be his 'regulars' but never once stopped by our table to make small talk, see how it was going etc. Personally, if I own a business, I am absolutely going to chat with my regulars, but I'm also going to make a point of talking to new clients because I want to grow my business. Word of mouth and all that. My folks were a little offended by the owner's lack of interest. The waitresses (one was the owner's daughter) were very nice so no complaints there.   The food: Honestly, I read a ton of reviews and know someone who has been to this restaurant before - but it didn't really do it for me. We decided to go with the Table d'Hôte which was fairly expensive - it included an appetizer, main, dessert and coffee/tea. I had the escargot in a Pernod sauce to start, and the dish lacked in overall flavor. The escargot were well-prepared but they just didn't taste anything. I then ordered the Capellini with shrimp and cantaloupe - I forget what kind of sauce it was because it took Yelp 2 weeks to add the business, But anyway, the sauce was a tiny bit sweet and creamy. In terms of flavor, I enjoyed the dish very much. The shrimp were big and tasty. I'm not a fan of cantaloupe so no comment on those. The only thing was that the pasta was too sticky and therefore I essentially had a lump of pasta in my dish that I had to take apart without getting sauce on myself. My mom ordered the Manicotti which she enjoyed but she's had better (she's Italian so I consider her input especially valid!) and my dad had the seafood pasta and was very happy with it. He also really liked his appetizer of sausage in a mustard sauce. The hit for all of us were the homemade desserts - I had the Tiramisu and it was delicious, and my folks had a pie-type dessert with fresh fruit that they loved. Sorry, I can't remember the name of that either but it was a hit with the parental units.  Price point: Pretty expensive. Frankly, I can go to Elio's in town and eat the exact same thing for about half the price. If you go with the Table d'Hôte, you're looking at about $30 right off the bat + taxes."}
{"text":"A nice, snowy Friday night of the end of November; the hubby and I spending some quality time alone and a reservation at Esmeralda!  The food was truly good, the service was something special and all that for a very moderate price.  This is a place we will visit again, and I sure hope its going to be sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food. Worth the detour. Owners are very much involved and always there to make a recommendation. Not one choice was I disappointed. In love with this place. Great comfort food! Home away from home meal. Warm and close to the heart"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with excellent service. I had for starters there mussels which were soooooo....tasty. Then for Dinner I had the Lamb shank which melted in my mouth."}
