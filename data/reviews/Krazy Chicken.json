{"text":"Krazy Chicken just opened in our neighborhood near Trop and Hualapai. The restaurant, tucked away in a small strip mall next to Rustica Pizza, is clean and modern. The menu is mostly Mediterranean. I ordered the chicken kabob combo to go which came with a fresh salad, hummus, pita bread and rice for just $10. It was delicious. Because each order is freshly prepared, expect to wait about 10 minutes or so. But it's well worth the wait. The friendly Armenian family who owns and operates the restaurant hope to have other locations across the valley in the future. I wish them good luck as this eatery shows a lot of promise. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here as I waited for my car to get washed and it was great. It was really clean, the employees were very friendly. I got the half chicken meal which was reasonably priced for the big portion. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The first time we came here was during their soft opening - the food was amazing!! It is made fresh for you & the prices are a little higher - but worth it for the quality! The guys who work here are really helpful!"}
{"text":"One word- AMAZING!! So happy with this place, always fresh & consistent. And the customer service is phenomenal. Obsessed with this place, I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I WAS NOT impressed on my visit  to Krazy Chicken. It had just opened for business a few days back and I decided to check it out. In my opinion their prices are too high for what they sell. I had their four (4) small chicken quesadillas for $7.00. They were OK, but personally I like the cheaper ones at Taco Bell and Del Taco's better."}
{"text":"Came across this place through Yelp by accident and decided to try it. We ordered the Half Chicken plate and ohhhhhhhhhh my gah it was amazing! Easily one of the best rotisserie chicken I've ever had. It comes with hummus, garlic sauce and pita bread. The hummus is fresh and not too heavy. The star is the garlic sauce though! Not too garlicky but a perfect combination with the chicken and pita bread. I wish I could by a bottle to take home.  The place is very clean and the people who work there are kind and attentive. I really hope this place makes it cause we'll definitely be stopping by every time we're in vegas."}
{"text":"The big red rooster caught our eye--great landmark. Everyone was so friendly and the customer was great.  Got the chicken quesadilla and it was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Krazy Chicken specializes in rotisserie chicken, more similar to Nevada Chicken Cafe than El Pollo Loco, but most comparable to Zankou Chicken. When you first walk in, the aroma of fresh grilled chicken is amazing! They have chicken plates by the quarter and half, with whole family meals, as well as kabobs, salads, and burgers.   Half rotisserie chicken meal was a huge, beautiful piece of moist chicken plus a big scoop of hummus with pita and a dish of radishes and pickles. While what I had was good, I'm perplexed as to why there wasn't rice included, as the menu seemed to indicate and would actually complete the meal. Bomb garlic sauce, though.   Grabbed a grilled chicken salad to go. Portion is large and topped with shredded chicken, which was a touch dry. I'd prefer to just get the chicken portion (still on the bone) intact and pull it off the bone myself to ensure it doesn't dry out, staff seemed friendly and might accommodate. Greek dressing was good and produce was fresh.  Location is clean and staff were polite, prices are reasonable with most meals under $10. My only beef with Krazy Chicken is that they serve all orders, whether takeout or dine-in, in styrofoam boxes- it's cheap and awful for the environment. Invest in plastic plates for diners at least, finding an eco-friendly box alternative would just be a bonus!"}
{"text":"Great food. Tried the whole Rotisserie  Chicken it was great crispy on the outside tender and juicy inside. They also have chicken kabob and beef kabob which I'll try next time.  I saw other people eating it looked real good.  Place is very clean. Family owned. Very nice people."}
{"text":"Krazy chicken, by far one of my favorite places eat now. From their kabobs, to there chicken burgers everything is simply great. It takes me 35 minutes to get here and I always make the trip when I'm hungry. Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I loved chicken burger+! I know it sounds krazy..nice sauce, delicious patty. I was Surprised!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our lunch here. I had the chicken kabob plate and the kabobs we're jucy and tasty. I loved the hummus and Greek dressing. I'd come back to try more items on the menu. It was somewhat unexpected that it was Romanian food but it was great."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and tastes amazing. The rotisserie chicken was tasty and juicy. Great selection of appetizers. Love this place. Must try the garlic sauce"}
{"text":"This is by far the best place I've Ate in Las Vegas! The best Burger I've had so far! Their food has a Tremendous amount of Flavor to it you won't be disappointed when you dine here. I can say that I will be coming here a lot more after discovering them!"}
{"text":"Having hailed from LA, land of the rotisserie chicken and pollo a la brasa, I've always found it strange that there aren't many rotisserie chicken places out here that weren't grocery or big box stores.   Even with the addition of Pollo Inka (an LA expansion), the selection is still slim.   That said, I was pleased to find that Krazy Chicken opened near me. I've eaten there three times now; twice dine-in and once for pick-up. As I type this, I am awaiting a delivery order from them. All of my experiences, to date, have been great. When we dined in, the service was attentive and kind; my one complaint was the use of disposable dishware and cutlery. We we ordered pick-up, the food was ready on time; hot and fresh.   The family meal is a great value - 1 whole chicken, 1 large (we're talking served in the same sized box as the chicken and filled completely), hummus, garlic sauce, and a whole bag of pita bread. Plus points for the extra steps taken to warm the pita before serving the meal. All in all, this is priced at $17.99. My husband and his parents enjoyed this meal, supplemented with a kabob platter, and had leftovers.   While it may not be Zankou-level, it's still a great choice for a clean, healthy, and affordable meal."}
{"text":"Great food. Super cute clean place & friendly staff. The reason for the 4 stars was the rice had zero flavor, I'll pass on that the next time."}
{"text":"My husband and I were happy to try this place, so we came back. You get quite a lot of food in the family pack for a totally affordable price. I just ordered 2 family meals and it's $38. I'm feeding a family of 4 but my 17yr old son and husband basically eat for 2 people. I love that this is a new mom and pop shop. I have only been here twice and gotten the family meal so far. But I am a huge Kebab lover so eventually I'll get to trying it. They have really good service. They gave me a Complimentary drink while I waited to pick up my to-go order. I just can't emphasize the value you're getting here."}
{"text":"This place by far has the BEST lula chicken kebab, coming from an Armenian who's eaten more kebab than an average human, it must be good (lol) my family orders platters of food when we have guests over and everyone can't stop eating it. Very tender and juicy. A definite must try."}
{"text":"Awesome place close to home. Moist chicken, great flavor, the garlic stuff is sooooooooo good! Call before to make sure they still have chicken. The family meal they have is a bargain for the amount of good food you receive."}
{"text":"Great Dinner! Family dinner is great food, great deal, and love that you can pre-order online through their website to be ready at a specific time. When you walk in you wait less then 2 minutes. Garlic sauce is great. Chicken is moist and fresh. The hummus is awesome. Adding on tabouleh makes the Greek salad over the top. Will definitely become a regular in our rotation of take out. Might even eat there, the place is so clean. Great new addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went here last night and really enjoyed the whole rotisserie chicken.  They have this kick-A$$ garlic sauce. I will be back to try more of the dishes!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out it was by the house. Chicken was great and fresh and the garlic dipping sauce was amazing. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great rotisserie chicken with a Mediterranean flair. Served with pita, hummus, pickled veggies and garlic sauce everything was delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great value but the chicken was bland.  Could use more marinading or seasoning."}
{"text":"Very nice environment. Friendly staff and everything was clean.  Order the chicken plate, it was very delicious!"}
{"text":"3.5***Ã— I'll give them a bit above my neutral 3 rating.  I was expecting this place to meet the standard of Zankou Chicken in Southern CA.  The meal plates almost look alike.  Having the combo is a must.    Some lost strikes on their chicken portion to cost comparison.  And their chicken wasn't juicy; didn't separate from the bones like magic.  They were good.  I'd rather pick up a whole roasted seasoned chicken at Smith's though; and purchase pickled veg, hummus and pita from my friend's friend.  The restaurant is clean.  The huge chicken outside the front doors is a can't miss eye catcher.  Their ice machine was out of ice.  Their online business app had a glitch with delivery fees (cost more than or almost the same as the order).    Can't say I'll return, but best wishes."}
{"text":"I don't know what others consider a \"family meal\" but the meal consisted of a large salad, which was ok. 5 pitas and garlic sauce which was good. The \"whole chicken\" on the other hand was more like a small hen. Just enough for 1 person. All for $20. I get a big rotisserie chicken from Sams Club for $5 and get 3 meals out of it and tasted the same. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was not disappointed. The rotisserie chicken was cooked perfect.  Juicy with great flavor. The basmati rice was long grain and was fluffy. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  We had take out from here when it first opened and it was great, so we decided to try it again.  This time we sat in the restaurant.  Absolutely the best chicken in Las Vegas hands down.  Both the rotisserie and kebab chicken were delicious.  They also have an excellent garlic sauce to dip the chicken into.  We couldn't get enough.  The food is also great value, and you can order a whole chicken to go for a family meal.  It reminds me of a great chicken place in Florida called Pollo Tropical, where we would order chicken for the family on dinner nights we didn't have anything planned.  Finally the staff is so friendly and good natured.  And the music kept the environment upbeat.  This place rocks!"}
{"text":"I just left the gym and I was craving some good clean protein so I stopped in here. It's healthy not fried chicken and it was fantastic. Would definitely come back. Thanks"}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Only 5 pieces in the kabob dinner plate. Chicken in the Greek salad was kind of bland"}
{"text":"Wow! Freshest hummus. Very yummy. Garlic sauce to die for.  We took our whole family in and everyone ordered something different so we were able to taste quite a few things.  Half chicken and chicken kabob had a delicious seasoning on it and cooked perfectly.  Tabule salad was fabulous.  Lule chicken sticks were so tender and yummy. Everything was great. Added bonus, they had fries for the kids. :) This is for sure a repeat experience."}
{"text":"This is right down the street from our house and from reading the reviews we were excited to try! I have to admit we were really disappointed... The chicken was dry and very bland.. the dipping sauce was great but that was about it .. the service was good and the restaurant was clean. Unfortunately we will not be going back because the food was just blah..."}
{"text":"Found this place from Yelps new places email. I'm glad I came. The chicken is perfectly cooked with perfectly browned skins and juicy meat. I don't usually eat the skin, but it was too good looking to pass up a taste, and I'm glad I did. The garlic dip is a must if you like garlic, if not the hummus is pretty good too. I also tried the muttabbal which had a nice smoky flavor. This place isn't far from home, so I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Yummy for chicken kebabs and rotisserie chicken. The flavors are on point and fresh. Must try the mutabbal which is like baba ganoush but even better! The staff are friendly and happy to help explain the menu items. Oh and the garlic sauce is sooo good! You can put it on just about everything."}
{"text":"Might have found a new favorite Greek/Med spot. Half chicken plate is pretty tasty, the pita is warm and fresh, and the staff is friendly. Not pricey and the food is good."}
{"text":"The best Lule kebab in town I always order it from here there is no doubt love it all my family crazy about this place"}
{"text":"The GOOD: Cock-a-doodle-doo!  You can't miss it...look for the humongous rooster in front (Trop and G.Canyon).  The place is pretty spacious inside with the high ceilings.  Chicken choices are more Mediterranean than anything else...had the half chicken and lule chicken plates...all very fresh made to order....Basmati vegetable rice is legite!  The BAD 15 minutes for takeout no other guests waiting...people already eating in the place...I get its made to order...so all fresh...just a bit too long =)  P.s. The name is kinda deceiving was thinking all types of chicken served here...i was thinking maybe fried chicken, hot wings, chicken sandwiches or chicken salads...maybe I was  expecting more than just Mediterranean style....just saying??"}
{"text":"Nice place, friendly service. I had the hot chicken wings and fries, everything was delish! Ill definitely return."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!! Ordered family meal while rotisserie chicken was extremely dry. And the whole chicken consisted of two small breast and two leg quarters. This was not a $20 meal. Could have went to Walmart and got a better chicken for $6."}
{"text":"Service was good. This is a Greek-ish restaurant. We had the family meal (chicken, hummus, pickled veggies, Greek salad, and pita bread) which is a great deal for an entire family. Hunny also ordered a chicken quesadilla. The salad was fresh, not watered down, great veggies. The hummus was a little bland. The chicken didn't really have flavor and the skin was tough. The quesadilla was more like a taco, because it wasn't sealed & had tomatoes & red onions in it. Hunny enjoyed the pickled veggies the most. Not our cup of tea but glad we tried it out."}
{"text":"Chicken was juicy and full of flavor. Salad was crisp and fresh. I enjoyed it and will return."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, fresh ingredients, and cool spin on Mediterranean food. The chicken is roasted, moist and has decent flavor. I like the healthy sides available including their pickled turnips - makes their joint unique."}
{"text":"This place was pricey for what you get. Two of us came and ordered the half chicken-extremely dry and no flavor you'd be better off with an Albertsons rotisserie chicken for a fraction of the price. The pita bread was thin and flimsy and burnt to a serious crisp. All I could taste was char. The hummus was ok. For the price we could of had a nice meal with a waiter/waitress. I wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty although I wasn't Amazed by the meal. It's right around the corner from our house so it's super convenient and I would probably order take-out again on a night when we're craving something easy and fresh.   Mediterranean is one of my faves and I guess I just wasn't super wowed although it was good. We ordered the family meal which came with a large Greek salad (I enjoyed the dressing), chicken, a pack of warm pita, hummus, 2 garlic butters and a little container of pickles veggies. We ordered a large rice for an additional side that was $5. Honestly I think the 'family meal' should come with  rice or a side because without the rice, the meal totally would've been missing something.   We have leftovers so the value of $25 for all the food we got was good. I guess the flavors just tasted like something I could have pretty easily made at home. But I didn't make anything so I guess I shouldn't complain ;)"}
{"text":"Great menu and prices. I had the chicken kebab, it came with pita bread and hummus plus a side salad. Very tasty meal at a very good price."}
