{"text":"We order takeout 3 or 4 times monthly. They do a nice job. Prices are reasonable and quality is high   My only complaint--when ordering noodles with shrimp, they only include a few little pieces of shrimp."}
{"text":"We came here on the second day after Grand Opening accidentally and promised ourselves to definitely come back when we are in town.  The perfect combination of fresh, delicious food and attentive, friendly staff!  Today we deliberately found the place and had our favorite Rock-n-Roll roll, octopus and sashimi - everything tasted amazing! We also got treated to a ahi-poki salad which was delicious! Everybody in this restaurant is very professional, caring, friendly and sweet. Being from California and not being spoiled by such an amazing customer service we decided to give this new restaurant 5 stars!!! It really shows when people care so much and put their hearts into something so special to them that it becomes very special to everybody else... Recommend it a 100% and will be coming back at least once a week."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is excellent and the staff great.  Every in is so friendly and each chef spends time getting to know you and your likes, as far as sushi goes.  We come here weekly now and have made Hiroba our sushi spot.   You got to give them a try. Did I mention the fresh fish, can't get it any fresher, unless u have a fish boat."}
{"text":"My go to Sushi joint as well as many of my neighbors. Great price and atmosphere. Friendly staff. Try the Vegetable Rock'n'Roll and Vegetable Udon soup. They also have rolls made with black rice (the black rice lemon roll is a favorite)"}
{"text":"This is an excellent sushi restaurant. The salmon sushi was fresh! The geisha roll was super tasty for people who like rolls. Highly recommended for sushi lovers"}
{"text":"We read the Yelp reviews on this new restaurant and decided to have lunch today. We ordered the Sashimi lunch special. The fish was very fresh. The miso soup was tasty and not watered down. The salad and dressing was crisp and fresh   Jake, the g.m., was very attentive and informative about the dishes and vendors.  He explained they keep their fish for 2 days only to insure the fish served is fresh! The sushi rolls were delicious but be careful when ordering SOS roll because it is extremely hot!! Prices were reasonable and the service was excellent.  We will definitely return to try other selections"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and cooked meals. The Thai chicken is out of this world. The Fruit Sour is delicious and very pleasing to the pallet.   Large portions for most meals. A wonderful place to entertain, go for a romantic night out or even just a decent dinner."}
{"text":"My cousin came in from out of state and was dying for sushi. Found this gem via yelp and was not disappointed! The fish was delicious and tasted a whole lot better than other places we have been to. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic and very inexpensive. California roll $2.99. Special rolls $7.99. Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Wow is all i can say very good sushi the prices are great. the wait staff is a+  at their job always checking up on you making sure you have everything you need. Best sushi i have ever had hands down, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Went to Hiroba for the first time tonight. I had the bulgogi entree. The food was delicious and the service was great! I would definitely recommend it. They even gave us some free mochi ice cream to go."}
{"text":"So glad this place opened! After Sin City sushi closed, it was hard to find a good replacement in the area. This place is it! Everything is fresh, even got the uni 30 minutes after delivery. Yum! Staff is so friendly and welcoming. Prices are excellent. I found my new spot!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi restaurant! They have an extensive menu of traditional Japanese foods. Everything I've ordered has been fresh, tasty, and reasonably priced! The deep fried rolls are just like the ones I'd get in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"Loved the green monster! Its a must try if you like avocado and crab! Another must try is crispy black lotus! The crispy rice is perfectly deep fried with spicy tuna on top!fresh fish! And cheap!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Truly unique recipes, incredible service and the prices are very reasonable. Great location! Don't miss this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I would describe the sushi here as fresh, simple and flavorful.  I used to like \"special rolls\", but now I'm into simpler rolls without all the tempura and heavy sauces masking the fish.  The fish tasted really fresh and it didn't need all the sauces.  The sauces were very simple, but very tasty!  I wish I got his name, but after we were seated one of the sushi chefs actually came up to us to take our order (we were seated in a booth far from the bar).  He gave us some suggestions and we ordered the Salmon Lover, Jumping Lobster and one the Caribbean.  All rolls were excellent and bite sized.  I hate it when the rolls are so big I need an knife and fork to eat a single piece.  The chef was nice enough to give us a sample (of what I wish I knew) that tasted awesome too.  I don't think you can really go wrong with anything you order here.  Pam our server was really nice too!"}
{"text":"I love Hiroba! Before coming to Hiroba Sushi I wasn't much of a raw sushi eater, I would order basic/cooked rolls they offer. The food was amazing! Every other visit I began to stray away from my comfort zone and order nigiri. Now, I'm in love with sushi! Hiroba has become my number one place to go. Their prices are affordable and the staff are welcoming and attentive."}
{"text":"Service was good, but the fish was not fresh. Oysters on the half shell were bleh. I only ate them because I was hungry. Sashimi was somehow lacking flavor. At least the tempura was clean. I would not come back here"}
{"text":"The food was Amazing. The service was great. My server was the best she took the time explained to us the \"black rice \" sushi will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"What's a sushi place hiding behind a Dominoes Pizza for? You should be curbside for ALL to see!! Joey, our server was awesome! She took the time to explain black rice, their specialty, to our party. The food was mouth watering. The ambience was just right and the service was excellent!! This is definitely a must!! Bring your family, friends and visitors from out of state. They'll totally love this place."}
{"text":"For people who'd rather eat sushi instead of turkey on Thanksgiving. This is the place to be. Parade on one screen, football on the other tvs.  Really good service. Amazing rolls and to die for desserts.  It has a great vibe. Enjoyed my meal here. Will be back !"}
{"text":"This place was great! The sushi was fresh and the service was very friendly and attentive. I ordered the Spicy Girl and Sashimi dinner and was not disappointed. I usually don't order rolls just because I'm not a fan of sauce and too much sticky rice, but the Spicy Girl was perfect. One of my friends ordered the Green Monster and I had a chance to taste it. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm digging this place. The interior gives this place a  different look than the other places around town. I mostly eat nigiri and they are slightly more affordable than at other places and just as good. Wife has enjoyed her salmon skin roll, shrimp tempura crunch roll, and short rib donburi (rice bowl). The place can get a bit busy since they just opened, but the servers know how to hustle and help each other out. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time since they've opened.  The sushi was great with very reasonable prices.  We usually go to \"all you can eat\" sushi places, which is not offered here.  However, with a such as we ended up eating here, which was pretty much a much as we eat at the AYCE places, we, both times paid pretty close to what we pay at AYCE places.  Actually even slightly less.  Their service is beyond superior!  Great customer service!  We had recently been in San Francisco, where they were going to charge us $5.00 for avocado for our 11 months old grandson.  Here, the owner himself brought a nicely cut up avocado (about 1/2 of one) to our table \"compliments\" for our grandson. Can't get any better than that, right?  I'm almost afraid to recommend this place for fear that there may end up being long waits the next times we come to here to eat.  Ha!  Ha!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place last week to have a small meal. I decided to make a review to thanks for there services and foods.  they were kinds and I saw chefs working hard and seemed like happy to serve people. last news is that their first year anniverssay is coming up this weekend."}
{"text":"Our late night random pick turned out to be a memorable experience. Chef Jeff did all the selecting for us, and it was beautiful. Try the Tuna Poke, and the yellow tail carpaccio.  Prices are disturbingly low. A must-go pick in Henderson."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm not a sushi expert and we went in January 2016.  I chose this place because of the good reviews on Yelp.  Because I'm not a sushi expert, I liked that the prices were less than other sushi places so it allows me to try different things.  The customer service was awesome and the food was tasty enough that I would go back to try more.  In conclusion, great customer service with great value and tasty food = 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Wow! I have a couple of sushi spots I already go to in the Anthem area, and this place crushes the others. Ambience is superior and well kept. Had 2 waitresses attending the table and our beverages were filled. Prices are incomparable to the others. More bang for your buck. Rolls were normal size and I would recommend the Red Rock roll."}
{"text":"I am extra picky when it comes to fish and sushi because I worked for an upscale sushi/Asian fusion bar in Orcutt California.  This place was great, fresh, fast and everyone was very very friendly. They have a wide selection of things to try as well, can't wait to go back when I have more time!"}
{"text":"The green monster is very tasty, very flavorful full of crab, avocado and scallop. But their other rolls fell flat. We had the spicy girl and the scallop mango roll.  rolls are decently priced, average is $8/roll. Service is ok, at the time there was one server and the manager.  The server seemed overworked and flabbergasted, and she was a little awkward. She tried to take our plates that still had sushi on it, but left our dirty finished dishes sitting.  This place is alright, their food is hit or miss, but I rather go to other places."}
{"text":"OMG.   It's unbelievable sushi-licious.  The quality of the food is worth the visit.   I always believe you eat with your eyes and not your mouth.  The foods are always fresh and prepared to your desires.   Say no more.  I suggest you take a visit and taste it for yourself.   Com'on YOLO."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new sushi spot near my home, and this did not disappoint!  I recommend the Black rice Lemon Roll. The service was friendly/ helpful with recommendations, and prices were great. This will be a new \"regular\" spot for my family."}
{"text":"It's first time today. What I can say is I just love everything about this place! The entire staffs were very friendly and attentive. Food came fast and fresh! ( I am Asian who have been loving raw fish over 20 years) It's not AYCE, but much better quality with good price. I guess this will be my go to sushi place. I am glad to find here!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. This is my go to sushi restaurant. I go here very often. Some sushi looks really expensive so don't get fooled by looks, the prices are really cheap."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! My new go to spot when not eating AYCE. Sushi and quality of fish is on point, service and staff is super nice and friendly and everything we had was delicious!  Been here multiple of times and each and every time was always good!! Being from Hawaii were picky with quality of fish and all the fish here tastes really fresh.  If you haven't been here yet definitely should try it out!!"}
{"text":"Went here instead of Kaizen down the street and Kaya in Chinatown and it was just an okay experience.   My family and I ordered and we waited quite awhile for all of our food to come out. The place wasn't even busy, but I guess everything comes out slow because there's only two chefs. But still, I was done with my regular rolls, appetizers, and sashimi before the rest of my family got any of their rolls. So it was like we were all eating at different times lol.   We ordered salmon stone roll, japanese lasagna roll, and some type of lobster roll and it seemed like all the rolls would fall apart when we would try to get it with our chopsticks. Since the japanese lasagna is a baked roll we thought it would be warm, but it was a bit cooler than expected. I also found a small bone in my sashimi because it poked me when I tried chewing it. Ouch.   Prices were okay, service could be better, and food has potential. But I don't think I'll be coming back after tonight. With sushi, I should probably stick to the spots I know."}
{"text":"Hiroba Sushi is Sushi as good as it gets! My husband is Japanese and very particular about his food, especially since he is always saying that most Sushi houses \"Americanize\" their food. He absolutely loves this restaurant. The prices are amazing. The service is incredible (especially Kun). We will make this a regular dining experience."}
{"text":"Surely, we'll be coming back to this place. We had such a great family time and the food was great! Very friendly and polite server and manager! Thank you for making our first visit awesome!"}
{"text":"Great quality of fish and prices that can't be beat!  My new favorite sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in henderson and even Las Vegas! Tons of options, gluten free to shellfish free rolls and rices. This place is very clean and affordable. We come on a regular basis and always leave fully satisfied!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi at a great price. We were very lucky to have decided to walk out on an AYCE seafood place that was unexpectedly charging holiday rates ($40/person) and come here instead, where we got better quality, perfectly adequate quantity, for about half the price!  The rolls aren't as large as at some places we've seen, but price reflects this. On balance I prefer it this way, because then you can try some more variety.  Some specifics: \"Rock and Roll\" (cucumber-wrapped) is excellent if you want non-rice/non-seaweed roll. \"Pink Lady\" is also delicious, with pink soy paper instead of seaweed. Soups used good broth. The \"Green Monster\" wasn't quite what we wanted: too much sauce for our taste. Maybe if it came with a bit of rice to cut it? The spiced squid salad was pleasant too.  I wish they had some kind of sashimi combo offer on the menu. And/or a sushi \"boat\". I'm too indecisive to pick my own...  To my taste, it's as good as any of my favorite Bay Area sushi places, and much better than typical random sushi I find in my travels."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting Hiroba Sushi, and let me tell you, this is the best sushi place in Vegas. Since most of people did a review on the sushi, I will mainly focus on drinks and desserts. I had milk tea, banana tempura ice cream, and cheese cake tempura.  Milk tea: it is match flavored milk tea. You can tell the server if you want it to be sweet or unsweet. Fyi, green tea powder is not sweet. If you like your milk to be sweet, just make sure to tell your server.  Banana tempura was AMAZING. Banana was soft but outside batter was so crispy. You can hear the crunchy sound :)  Cheesecake tempura was also amazing and delicious. Cheesecake was as good as the ones from cheesecake factory!  I will come here just for the desserts because its that good."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was amazing!! Everything is reasonably priced and our chef John was so nice and surprised us with 3 different rolls not on the menu which were all delicious! All the sushi was very fresh. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"After a few successful visits here we wanted to mark this sushi place as a \"favorite\" ...but we dined here last night as a group and the whole service was very OFF.  1) sushi we ordered was not what was delivered to table and waitress argued with us, 2) friends said sushi quality was poor, 3) the waitress charged us for the wrong sushi, 4) a dish we ordered never arrived, and 5) we practically had to beg / chase someone down to pay our bill. Nothing worse than a crappy experience that lingers on....\"Check please!\"  Needless to say we won't return."}
{"text":"Love the black rice sushi! Go get some and believe me you would keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I love Hiroba Sushi! They seriously have the best prices in town when it comes to your favorite sushi rolls. I've ordered take out from here twice and the food is always ready in under 10min and packaged perfectly to enjoy when I arrive home. We have also dined in for both dinner and lunch. The servers here are the nicest always so sweet and hospitable.   From the regular roll menu that are $3.99 I recommend the spicy tuna and mexican roll. All other rolls are great too and only set you back about $9.99 for their most expensive. Their garlic edamame are perfect to start your meal with. A bowl of miso is only $.99 which is really how much it should be everywhere!"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in town. I was very pleased with their healthier alternatives outside of white rice. Their service is absolutely wonderful, highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The service was really fast! And the workers were really nice and the customer service was also great! The quality of the fish wasn't that high end compared to other sushi places but it wasn't terrible.  Pricing was on the cheaper side which was good, it got pretty crowded around 6:30 -7. But it was still not over crowded."}
{"text":"This place is awesome neighborhood sushi. Not a fancy place but the service and food is great."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Hiroba is a cheap option for high quality sushi. The restaurant is spacious and clean and the waiters and chefs are absolutely the friendliest.   If you're in the mood for sushi, but not quiet in the appetite for All You Can Eat, then this is the place to go. Their nirigi is only $2.99 for two pieces and their rolls are mostly under $10. Their best deals for lunch and dinner are their specials combinations. You can get a few nirigi pieces and a cali or tuna roll for around $15 or for the same piece get a whole bento box. These specials come with salad and miso soup too! This restaurant is my go to place for sushi. It's cheap, it gets me full, and the quality of the food is great!"}
{"text":"Sum up in few words and being a manager of past Well known Japanese restaurants, this place is by far the best in Nevada actually in a lot of places in west coast. Black rice!!!! Amazing. My favorites are black lemon roll and Hanoi no rice roll. Jenny is my favorite server by far meets all expectations. Harry is awesome sushi chef if you are lucky to sit and have him at sushi bar than you are in good hands. All the staff are just the best never seen that especially for a sushi place. Oh and Youh is great as well very friendly and personable. Consider me a loyal regular."}
{"text":"It was a rainy day and my family was in town and I really wanted to take them to try out Kitchen Table. Unfortunately the wait was going to be 1 hour for the 3 of us, and my parents had already been on the road for 5 hours driving through rain and ice from LA: they were really hungry. So we went to the nearest Japanese restaurant which was also a new venue in the area, Hiroba Sushi.  Upon walking in, the restaurant was nicely crowded and the staff greeted us. We were seated and given menus to look through. The restaurant was roomy and there was plenty of space between tables.  My dad ordered the ramen, my mom got the sashimi lunch plate, and I got the pork katsu plate. My dad commented on the texture of the ramen resembling instant noodles, but the flavor was decent and salty. My mom's sashimi lunch plate tasted good; the sashimi itself was fresh and didn't have that fishy taste that my mom hates. My pork katsu was tasted good, it was moist and had a mild soy sauce flavor. The meat wasn't too thick as I was getting a bigger crunch from the fried portion than I was getting a taste of the pork itself. The rice was slightly dry and wasn't as moist as I'd expected, but palatable nonetheless. I liked the overall presentation of the food, if only their flavor and texture were on the same level as their appearance. The portion isn't as large as I'd hoped, but for the price it was a decently filling meal.  The facility was clean and the staff was very nice. At certain times I felt like the staff was too concerned with our enjoyment of our food, but a little extra attention isn't that bad of a thing.  I'd recommend you give Hiroba Sushi a try if you're feeling like eating some Japanese cuisine around the area."}
{"text":"Yummy!! This will be our new 2nd favorite sushi spot. Very clean and friendly staff. All the rolls come in 8pcs unless otherwise specified. The price is good for all the rolls. The menu has a good selection of other items. The only thing they don't have is an all you can eat. Maybe in the future?"}
{"text":"This place was brilliant.  The sushi options were extensive and absolutely tasted great.  We especially loved the Alien.  It is not your traditional sushi as it is cooked, but it was so tasty.  They make extensive use of black rice for a lot of their dishes, which was just so amazing.  Definitely going back on our next trip."}
{"text":"Always love this place.  The offer a wide variety of black rice sushi and rolls something I really like!  Every meal I have had is great and the service is fantastic.  A better bargain than other nearby sushi places..."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. If you have a chance to sit at the bar...do. The sushi chefs are amazing to watch. The chef I would presume to be the owner is such a pleasure to watch him. He walks the line of almost Cajan Fusion Sushi. Every plate exudes Precision.  It's the off menu item he creates on the side that are heavenly. The cost is very responsible and the wait staff is up beat and attentive."}
{"text":"Really good sushi at a affordable price. I've always gotten good service here; the food usually is out in a timely manner. The owners are there sometimes; really good people."}
{"text":"Outstanding small sushi joint with the finest fish. This restaurant easily rates 5 stars."}
{"text":"Another reviewer took the words right out of my mouth, \"Waffling between three and four stars.\" The one thing that will keep me coming back here is the Black Lemon Roll (black rice). It's simple, fresh, citrusy and flavorful without all of the added sauces. I decided on four stars because this one roll is that good and they offer black rice which is pretty fantastic. So far, this is the only place I know of in Vegas that offers black rice, and I've been to quite a few sushi places around town.     Service:  Everyone here is really sweet and on their A-game, so no problems in the service department.   Delicious Dish:  Black Lemon Roll  Pricing:  Compared to most other places in Henderson/Las Vegas, I would say the pricing here is pretty fair if not inexpensive for the quality of food they provide.   Alternative Places Nearby:  I Love Sushi -or- Spicy Tuna"}
{"text":"Found a new gem!! Definitely my new go to spot!! Been here a few times food is Amaaaazing!! lots of variety compared to other sushi spots we've been to, black rice rolls is a must try! Also for those fellow sweet lovers they have a lot of different sweets to choose from my fave Tempura Fried Cheesecake YUM!! Great friendly and FAST service!! Will also be my new pregame spot they have a variety of different SAKEs, beers and wine!!"}
{"text":"This place is \"the place\" for sushi on this side of town. The food quality and taste is excellent! Pricing is mid-range so that's a plus. The staff and chefs are really nice. The place is clean and customer service is another reason that makes you come back. The menu has decent selection. We visit Hiroba Sushi almost every month and each time we go we truly enjoy our food and experience!"}
{"text":"Pros: Great service/staff, huge variety, decent pricing  Cons: so far I have not had a bad experience  Details: We have gone here twice and both times the highlight was the service. The sushi is quite good, but I have not found a \"wow\" item on the menu. I most recently tried a black rice roll and that was unique, as was the green monster. The pricing is very reasonable for sushi, especially in this part of town."}
{"text":"Great Sushi!!!!  Loved the Green Monster and the CoCoMoku.  They have some rolls made with Black Rice instead of the typical sticky rice.  Different but was still tasty.  Green Monster was so good we went back twice just for that while in town for only 4 days!!!  We will definitely be back when we are in town again."}
{"text":"Since we've recently moved into the area from Hawaii, we were reluctant to try new (to us) sushi bars as there were so many to choose from, and boy, did we luck out choosing Hiroba Sushi!  Our 1st time there and we absolutely loved the service & delicious food we ordered.  We will definitely be back and we'll bring our family & friends too!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best sushi in Henderson. I have been to many places and this one has some of the freshest food and best prices. I have been twice now and highly impressed! I am already looking forward to coming again!"}
{"text":"Hiroba Sushi is a nice clean place to eat. Staff always greet you when you walk in & when you leave they thank you for coming. I tried this place once before when they first opened & there was a piece of plastic I had eaten from the salad & when I mentioned it to the owner they just apologized. No discount given! So I vowed to never go again. I finally went back recently & it was better. Their food is good, green tea ice cream is delicious! If you want to get more for your buck try their special bento box. For $11.99 you get individual side soup, salad, choice of  entree, three to four pieces of tempura and sushi rolls. Their portions are more than enough for one person, but that's my opinion."}
{"text":"Found this place about a year ago. Super fresh, tasty, beautifully displayed food, nice variety of rolls, etc.  Service is very friendly, and food comes out pretty quickly. Tonight it's a full house, yet waited in average about five minutes for our orders.  Since it's not an AYCE, everything is priced smartly so you can enjoy without going broke. Nice ambiance. We've become regulars here, and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"This place is my new sushi bar! The staff was friendly and the manager goes out and beyond making us feel comfortable as if we were her repeated customers, although it was our first time there, they did a fantastic job. We're from Hawaii and we know sushi. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Clean, new restaurant. Very friendly service. A lot of new rolls, very fresh favors! My favorite spicy girl, wave crest, salmon lover, sunrise. The chestnut monblanc dessert is delicious! Very inexpensive too!! They opened up about a month ago and I have been here 4 times already! So good!!"}
{"text":"My office is very near this location. There are several sushi places nearby and this is the 3rd sushi place in that exact location in the last several years. So my thought was, ok just another sushi joint.  As soon as I walked in I noticed how much they improved the interior. The feeling inside the place was warm and friendly.  An older lady sat me down and gave me some complimentary miso soup to try. The sushi was amazing!!!!  What's even more amazing was the prices. It's my new favorite sushi joint!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Sushi  restaurants in Henderson area!  As we live close by I think for its size they are very quick and very organized! Amazing menu we had someone with a sesame allergy in a SUSHI restaurant right you are wounding what they are doing there but they do have a special menu for them!!!!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is pretty cool; clean and well-kept. Sushi prices are definitely not bad, and I feel like you get more than what you pay for. I ordered the volcano roll and sweetie roll, and neither disappointed. My only gripe is that I don't live in Vegas, or else I'd be here more often."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and I only have wonderful things to say about it. Fantastic service with lovely ladies who are always super nice serving. The sushi is really really great, I've even become a fan of the dark rice they have too.   So I already recommended the jalapeño poppers they have. It comes in four pieces and it's not super spicy just has a little kick.  The S.O.C. is amazing!!! (I had that in a past visit)The Vegetable Rock and Roll is also super super amazing!!! I'm still in the process of trying everything. Today I had the veggie rock and roll and the Mang in Black. Mang in black is not spicy but a little sweet. The tempura is always excellent so far. We were gluttons today and tried the Ice cream and Tempura Banana dessert... heavenly and sinful all at once. I really dig the decorations and the beautiful paintings there."}
{"text":"Customer service is superb!!! Fast and courteous. Sushi is great for the price (no premium) and I love the black rice. Sashimi, geisha roll, and bunch of nigiri. Average Saturday night no waiting."}
{"text":"This the by far the best sushi I have ever eaten! They have so many healthy alternatives, including black with any roll if you like. This is my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Green Monster($7.99), Mexican Roll($2.99), wasabi and ginger! Wow Hiroba surprised me again! This is my 6th time coming here but I am always blown away by the taste and price of the food items! I would recommend the Tuna Poki for a starter, the Mexican & Spicy Tuna Roll, and the bulgolgi beef. Great atmosphere, masterful chefs, wonderful food, and amazing prices! Definitely will be returning many, many more times."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe that I haven't written a review for Hiroba Sushi.  My family and I have been regulars at Hiroba for the past year and we have definitely enjoyed each visit.  The menu is diverse (hot/cold dishes, sushi, sashimi, bentos, rice bowls, noodles, and dessert) and they offer black rice sushi - which I've never seen anywhere else.   My favorites are:  Hamachi kama (grilled) Sashimi (their sashimi pieces are thick!) Hamachi carpaccio Salmon Skin hand roll Eel and Avocado hand roll Rolls: Sally, Salmon lover, Dragon, Rainbow, pretty much anything with Hamachi - and you can sub black rice for any of the rolls Donburi (teriyaki chicken)   The service is very friendly and we usually do not have to wait very long for service. The restaurant is clean, and has a nice cozy vibe.  I love that they are open late - and everyday (including holidays)."}
{"text":"Went here right after they first opened and have been back many many times.   I have waited to do a review so I could give a  full knowledgeable review.  They are great! The staff is always friendly and very attentive. Service has always been great.    I love their spicy edamame! Always fresh!   Some of our favorites are: The Green Monster The Geshsa Roll The Mexican Roll The Crispy Black Lotus  The only draw back to this place is that everyone else is finding out how good they are!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place! Obsessed with the food! Great service! And the owners are awesome!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome, and the price definitely did not reflect how damn good the food was.  I walked out with $20 more in my wallet than I normally do when I get good sushi, so this may become a more regular haunt for me.  They have a big to-do about their black rice.  It's neat, it's super pretty, it's supposedly better for you than white rice.  It's even yummy.  I still prefer the white rice.  The stuff is good, so no points down, just preference.  I swear I'm not racist.  Bottom line: Great food, great service, extremely reasonable pricing.  It's up there with some of my favorites now."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi joint in Henderson! So friendly and yummy! :) Black rice sushi is amazing! Mango salmon is good we like to eat it as dessert."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but I couldn't when I found plastic wrapper around my crab stick in my sushi roll. They were so nice about getting me another roll and even said they would comp that one, but then they didn't. The excuse was they would have to ask the manager, well then they should have. That was really the only disappointment. If they would have just taken care of it, I would have given 5 stars and chalked it up to a mistake. Overall the staff is super nice, attentive and a great comfortable environment."}
{"text":"My husband and I love sushi. We used to go to I Love Sushi all the time till we found this gem. One of our friends told us about this new sushi restaurant around 6 months ago so we decided to try it.  Wow we were very impressed! The food is amazing. All their fish is fresh and delicious. Most sushi places don't serve blue fin tuna but this great place does and it is first class. I love all their black rice rolls. They are so creative and tasty!  We go here at least once a week and look forward to our date night. The customer service here is exceptional. Everyone is friendly and knows us. It makes the experience even better.   I've eaten at Nobu and many other sushi restaurants but this place is excellent for the overall value relating to good quality, price, menu selection, customer service, and ambiance."}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed my experience here.  The sushi was great and the nigiri had a little rice and a lot of fish.  The staff was very friendly...  The only thing keeping it from five stars is that half way through our meal they disappeared.  It was impossible to find the servers and it didn't seem that busy. I will he going back again and I am hoping to update this review. If you do go, try their spicy sashimi salad!"}
{"text":"New favorite in the neighborhood. Great food, great prices with fast and friendly service!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Hiroba Sushi for takeout today, and I was NOT disappointed!! The staff was friendly, prompt, and wonderfully accomodating. All three of the rolls I got were beyond delicious and very well priced for sushi. I highly recommend the lemon roll and pink lady roll!"}
{"text":"superb!! great food, great interesting menu, super friendly staff. I recommend this place highly. We did my daughter's 11 th birthday dinner there the other night and we we were traveling in two cars from different locations.  My daughter and I got there 30 minutes before the rest of our party and they sat us down at the table and looked after us without a hassle for the whole time till the rest of the table arrived. The food is a cut above the typical sushi places on eastern. Not every custom roll is filled with cream cheese and they use black rice for a bunch of signature rolls. lots of other options if you don't want a roll. lots of variety and very tasty!! we will will return again and again."}
{"text":"I am a huge sushi critic and let me tell you Hiroba's chefs know what they are doing! I couldn't get enough of the sunrise roll. So glad my clients decided to met here to celebrate their new home! Will definitely be back with clients, friends, and families."}
{"text":"Still a 5 star - this place just keeps getting better and better!  Fish is soooo fresh! ----------------------------- Good sushi and so close to my house!  Fish quality is great, they have plenty of fun and healthy rolls, pricing is great.  The staff is all extremely friendly.  We came two nights in a row.   In a nutshell, quality, customer service and pricing will keep me coming back at least once a week, I'm sure.  Just updated from 4 stars to 5 because they are consistently awesome!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Had some of the best sushi here. The Volcano roll is my favorite :) I've eaten here a few times and will definitely become a regular. The customer service is awesome! The sushi is amazing and i cant wait to keep exploring the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place. Try the Salmon skin salad! The mango salmon roll, green monster, and lemon roll are also really good. Everything is fresh and delicious. Prices are also very reasonable. Service is always friendly and attentive. My new go-to place in Henderson."}
{"text":"So I'm updating this review based on all the take out orders I have made since my first dine in experience.  Since my first visit my favorites have been: Uni Nigiri Salmon Belly Nigiri Masago Nigiri Salmon Skin Hand Roll Hamachi Kama (not a fan of their ponzu)  I have ordered a few hot dishes but their Spicy Pork is really good!  Today I dined in for lunch. I ordered the usual.  Everything was so good. But the Uni wasn't to my liking today which I was sad about since this place has consistently delivered on their Uni. But the manager came and talked to me about the different seasons and how they affect the flavor profiles of the Uni. Whatever the case I felt bad returning it but she made sure I left satisfied.   I'm giving 5 stars because you can't beat their prices!! I had salmon belly for $2.99!!! And Salmon Skin Hand Roll for $2.50!!! What?! Come on, this place is unbeatable when it comes to price!  Oh and The manager was nice:)"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and even better service. Everyone was super friendly - my husband and I sat at the bar and chatted with the chefs, and the servers asked us often how things were. For the record, the Oh My Roll was the best!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We have been going here every week since they have opened. They always are so friendly and the sushi never disappoints. We have kids and they always make sure they are taking care of and always give great recommendations for new items/kid friendly foods. If you live in the area come check it out and the price never disappoints either!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise - finding a quality sushi restaurant close to the house. I had been a big fan of I love Sushi until very recently. Hiroba Sushi is located in a very small shopping center just south of the Smiths shopping center on Eastern. They have a huge menu. I really like the photos of the most popular dishes on the last 4 or 5 pages of the menu. Based on the photos, we opted to try black rice sushi for the first time (really good!!). We started with monkey brain. The good news the dish has nothing to do with monkeys or brains. It is a warm sushi dish (I think deep fried) with a wonderful combination of flavors. Delish!!! Then we got a Galaxy roll and a Geisha (both with black rice). Both really good. Combine the very reasonable prices (most rolls under $10, expensive rolls under $15), good quality food, and excellent service, this becomes my new go to sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good food, great service and excellent price for what you get. Very happy.  I would say I got the food and the bill just I am finishing the food faster than McDonald, it seems they want the table bad for other customers. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Come check this place out!  It's only been open for 4 months but it had a good crowd! The service was amazing and fast. Every employee was super friendly.  The food was fresh and had a good quality. The lady who I am assuming was the owner was beyond friendly and she seemed so proud of the place. Oh..and the prices!!!! You can't beat them"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing. Hands down the best sushi restaurant in Henderson. Our server was so friendly and made the dining experience that much better. The food was terrific and the menu is reasonably priced. Our new go to spot!"}
{"text":"Finally, some great sushi close to home. I can't believe it took me so long to find this place. The service was great, sushi was reasonable priced and high quality, and the environment was cozy and welcoming. A+++  I tend to avoid chains, especially when there are so many other options in this city. This place is family owned and has great food.   I tried the Spicy Garlic Edamame, the Black Lemon roll, and the Black Tiger roll. The spicy garlic edamame was ACTUALLY spicy. In most experienced I just find them to taste like overcooked garlic. These were balanced and flavorful, exactly what I want, and need in edamame. My friend and I were looking around observing all the rolls other people were eating. The couple next to us ordered the Black Lemon roll. When they spotted us not so subtly staring down their food, they informed us that it was their favorite and they order it every time they come in. OBVIOUSLY we had to try it. It was the most unique sushi roll I've ever had. Filled with forbidden black rice, and crab, topped with salmon and yellowtail, lemon and drizzled in a light lemon sauce, it was amazing. The Black Tiger roll paled in comparison, but it was still delicious.   Their sake selection is also pretty extensive, and with a variety of prices, you can order something super expensive, or just stick with house hot sake, which is also not bad.  They owners were friendly and treat you like family. They enthusiastically great you when you walk in and make conversation casually throughout your visit.   Overall, my experience was amazing. I will definitely be frequenting this place in the future. Hiroba, we love you."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this place, I am greeted with the Japanese sushi restaurant greeting \"irishaimase!\" Lol I like that! The food is very delicious and it is reasonably priced. This is my go to spot for sushi and it was recommended by my brother who has lived here for 20 years. I am new to the Las Vegas area and I am loving the Vegas life! I'm exploring all kinds of places. Now, I am a newbie to being vegan And have found that this place has great vegetarian/vegan options. I have posted photos of that portion of the menu as well as the vegan sushi that I had. If you have an allergy they also will post foods that are allergy specific friendly such as sesame seed allergy. since I'm new to being vegan I have been to this place before I was being so, I can tell you the other two shoes are super delicious! If I weren't Radion I would definitely be getting hot night sushi. The geisha is also good and they use black rice for some of their sushi's. Those I should warn you though are a little more pricier. I don't think you'll regret going to this place if you give it a try. Hope to see you there. Btw, they do have drinks! Kanpai!"}
{"text":"Waffling between three and four stars:  friendly, attentive service and a massive array of well-priced rolls are two major things that make this spot stand out. Portions were large, fish was decently fresh, but the sashimi and nigiri seemed to lack some flavor- it's average AYCE quality but without the AYCE price structure, IMO.   That said, the friendly faces and good pricing will make this place memorable, plus they seem to be in a location that doesn't have many sushi options to begin with. Most rolls are $7.99, with a few special options running a bit higher. Menu is much larger than expected, with several apps, pages upon pages of rolls, including a few fruit rolls and cucumber-wrapped riceless rolls.   TIP: Opting for the pick-2 dinner bento (opting for the sashimi and nigiri) gets you an extra roll (spicy tuna or California) over getting the Sashimi dinner."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here, been coming here for awhile since I live right across the street. But I'm giving this a one star review for this one reason. My gf and I sat at the bar for the first time, naturally since I'm a chef, I love to peek into the craft of sushi chefs. As I was watching, \"chef\" Howard, told me that watching them was the same as if someone was looking into my master bedroom.. wtf. That's so disrespectful. The food isn't worth that kind of remark."}
{"text":"My mom lives in Henderson so we come to visit.  We usually go to I love sushi across the way, but wanted sushi for the second night in a row.  With good reviews and a pic of the Green Monster (one of their \"rolls\") looking pretty tasty, we stopped in.  1, we were amazed by the prices - spicy tuna roll was $2.99 compared to I love sushi $6.99 wtf? To me, the quality was better here at Hiroba too.  Our faves are albacore and salmon sushi and both were fresh and delish.  The owner stopped by to visit too.  We will 100% be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. The portions are large and the prices are very reasonable compared to some other sushi places in the area. The quality of the sushi is excellent and so are the hot dishes. This is the first time My husband and I ate here and it will be our go to place for sushi."}
{"text":"Who would have thought I would have the best sushi I've ever had 30 minutes off the strip? I'm from a big city, Chicago, and I've had sushi in a lot of different places (Hawaii, Cali, Toronto, Vancouver, but I have to say this was the BEST I've ever had. I usually have nigiri instead of rolls so I ordered the nigiri and Sashimi plate. Each fish was super fresh, super flavorful and super tender. They literally melted in my mouth! I tried some of the rolls my wife ordered and they were spectacular as well. The combination of fish, sauces, garnishes and black rice made for very distinct flavors. The black rice is a bonus, as the texture and unique taste definitely enhances the seafood. One would expect to pay top $$$ for sushi this good, especially on the strip. But being in the suburbs, We felt is was a great value. The sushi plate was typically what I'd pay for in Chicago, $24. And the rolls were very reasonable between $8 and $12. This will surely be one of our go to places every time we visit my mother in law in Henderson."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite sushi places ! It's the best because it's close to my work, so I can always stop in & grab a delicious lunch! Always has good service, staff is friendly & the food is delicious! My favorite is the Mexican Roll!"}
{"text":"I live in Anthem and have been to most of the Japanese restaurants down Eastern and the vicinity. I finally went here last week and wished I had eaten here sooner. The people are so friendly, place is very, very clean and the service was great!  I had the Salmon Lunch Special which was real good and filling. There are so many dishes on the menu that I haven't seen before and am looking forward to trying.  I'll be frequenting this place to eat for sure and telling my neighbors about it.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"I order all the time but was very disappointed the last few times. The sushi is tasteless and does not taste too fresh. Prices are great amd service is awesome though!"}
{"text":"This is our new go-to place for sushi. Great selection and good prices. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Try the Black Tiger (black rice is used)! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place for lunch when another place in the area wasn't open for lunch anymore. Pleasantly surprised. Love the black rice options and the dressing on the salad. Fish was really fresh. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The black rice sushi was the best and excellent customer service too. Very fast and food was delicious. I will be stopping by again."}
{"text":"After reading so many positive reviews I was very excited to try this sushi place. I was striking over priced for wine...the two glasses I had were more than my sushi for maybe 6 oz total. I had the lemon roll which was good and the other roll was something in conjunction with spicy tuna and was so bad I didn't finish it."}
{"text":"Very good I highly recommend the galaxy. Plus they use black rice and can be substituted in any of the other dishes. The servers are extremely friendly and come back frequently to ask if your ok or if we needed anything."}
{"text":"Not only is this place yummy, it's cheap. When you frequent sushi and are used to spending $60 to $100, it refreshing to find good quality sushi for a good price. Definitely suggest going to eat here. The service is wonderful and it's clean to top."}
{"text":"If you want to be welcomed at the door and thoroughly taken care of with great quality sushi, this is the spot. Make sure you get the tea."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place!! Love the staff and the prices. Try the Lemon Roll and Oh My Roll. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Loved the food Here! Super surprised by the quality of food at the price. We had the spicy garlic edamame, best we've ever had! The sunset roll and rick n roll were amazing too. Anything that has their lemon vinaigrette is to die for. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"What an amazing find. We were celebrating my husband's birthday and wanted to try a new place. The staff was very professional and the food was so fresh. The owners were working and making sure everything was perfect. The prices and selections were amazing, especially for the top quality they provide. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This may be the best sushi restaurant I have ever been to!  The food was amazing and fresh and came in nice portions.  The menu was very diverse and had a few items that I have never heard of before.  I almost always eat AYCE sushi so I was disappointed to find out they did not have that option here but soon forgot about that when I tasted the food.  It was all so amazing!  That being said, for the quality, you will pay.  When I finally learn to eat sushi without having to gorge myself, I will come back here in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer here and have been for about 6 months now.  Hiroba's prices and quality can't be beat.  I love how fresh the fish is here.  The staff is super friendly and the sushi chefs are so nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"I've only had take out here. From what I had, some rolls are absolute hits and a few aren't quite so fabulous. For $2.99 a roll, I'll focus on the good ones.   \"Mexican\" is spicy crab, the Philedelphia and the spicy tuna are all fantastic. I bought 9 rolls for an event for under $30. You can't beat that. Eel is usually my favorite, but I'd steer clear here.   In all those in attendance at the event said they would like this sushi again. I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"This new spot is a great find. The service is fantastic and the sushi is fresh and creative. A great addition to restaurants along Eastern for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a low key dinner and wow this place is wonderful! The atmosphere was chill and the staff was very friendly. What surprised me most was how high quality the food is with such low prices. The menu is large and diverse with sections for dietary restrictions. This is going to be my new go to sushi joint! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"My favorite people ever!!! This is hands down the best sushi in town!  Although it is not AYCE the prices are extremely awesome!  Most speciality rolls are only $7.95!  Miso soup is only $1! I always sit at the sushi bar with Jon.  He hasn't missed a day of work since they opened!  You will not regret going here. Get the screaming O and the Green Monster!!!  Love love love this place!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The sushi is amazing and fresh. So much better than the other places in Henderson. Definitely deserves five stars for service in addition to food. The popcorn shrimp roll is my favorite. Crispy rice and spicy tuna is a great appetizer."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the neighborhood.  I've tried all around Anthem in Henderson, and hiroba it is hands down the most tasty and high quality here.  Super friendly staff providing great service.  My family of had enjoyed dinner at this place 3 times, but we've had ordered to go maybe 10 more.  Green monster a must try.  We also like the rice less sushi rolls."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a great sushi spot, decided to check this new spot since its in my area. Cute restaurant with very nice staff who welcomes you once you step in. We sat at sushi bar and chef Jay welcomed us right away and got our orders fast. Jay was really nice and attentive and was able to make my sushi without the stuff I was allergic to, appreciate that! The food was very tasty, love the sauces and special rolls they made, slightly different from other sushi places so I liked that. I usually go to AYCE at Sakana but the price here on everything we got including alcohol equaled to the same. Both places are different, cut of fish is the same along with the small bit of rice they put with nigiri which I love, but Hiroba offered more entree items and rolls are more my style with the sauces when I'm feeling rolls. When I'm feeling for more sashimi, I'll hit up Sakana, more fish for the buck.  Service: A+  Food overall: A Spicy Girl Roll: A+ Yellowtail Carpaccio: A+ SOS: A+ if you LOVE spicy food - veryyyy spicy so don't get it if you hate spice Snow White: B Fruit roll with banana and apples: A+ a different take on dessert not your typical sushi dessert like Mochi or tempura ice cream so I like that.. But just a lil pricey for dessert  Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice: A for my boyfriend he likes that crispy rice  Price: B  Next time I will try their entrees/rice bowls"}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi -  Unique Dishes and outstanding service!   The best in Henderson/Las Vegas...  The best of the best!"}
{"text":"We went to Hiroba Sushi yesterday because the ratings and pictures were great!  As soon as you walk in, you get an enthusiastic greeting.  I love that! The three of us got the combination Bento Boxes and we enjoyed our dinner.  My spicy prawns were sticky, sweet, and so delicious.  My order also included salmon, nice size salad and the dressing was really good, rice, 3 pieces of tempura, 6 slices of California rolls, and two dipping sauces.  The servers and another nice lady (I wonder if she is the owner) came by often to see if we needed anything.  This restaurant is only four minutes from my house and I will be back soon! Thank you Hiroba Sushi, keep up the fantastic job!"}
{"text":"5/5 Went back last night for the first time since I think late January. Delicious. No pictures to share because we enhaled it all! Good to see John and pick on him! We'll be back!   9/11 - If I could give 4 & 3/4 stars I would!!! John was an amazing sushi chef at the bar for us and we had a blast! 95% of our meal was DELICIOUS. We had tempura, gyoza, halibut, red snapper, yellowtail carpaccio, quail egg shooter, Uni shooter, toro, sweet fish, hot spicy roll (or something like that, pic attached), got a sample of the nacho pescado, bulgogi, popcorn lobster- tempura key lime cheesecake .... Maybe more but I am forgetting and the only thing I'd have to rate down for is the halibut was pretty tasteless (could've used Himalayan salt Or shiso leaf) and the sweet shrimp I requested as Ama ebi which is sweet shrimp with fried shrimp heads- the sweet shrimp was gummy and the heads weren't fried enough BUT that being said it wasn't something they offered I asked for it special. Other than that a BEAUTIFUL date night and we will definitely be back to see John. The waitresses were super helpful and attentive as well! We will see y'all soon!"}
{"text":"The service, food quality and price point is something that you can't beat! Just discovered this place not too long and it has become one of my favorite places in town. I'm a huge lover of sashimi and this place has the freshest fish I have ever eaten (and I've eaten at numerous sushi joints). The servers as well as the chefs have a great sense of urgency. They always make sure I'm always taken care of. Two thumbs up for Hiroba"}
{"text":"I haven't even left the restaurant and I had to pull out my phone and review this place. I have had sushi everywhere from Seattle to Miami and this has got to be the best sushi I've ever had.  The service was amazing,  food came super quickly, the menu was extensive and creative, the prices were beyond reasonable and even my kids LOVED it (and they don't like anything, ever.) If you are in the area, or even if you aren't- you MUST try this place!  A new favorite for sure."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch. Again blown away by the quality of the food!! The service remains A++++! Me and me my husband will continue coming to recommend this establishment as the best Sushi restaurant in Henderson/Vegas. The Strip could not compare to this place. Safe the drive to Vegas and come here!!!!"}
{"text":"I come here for sushi often. The staff is so nice and welcoming. Sushi is affordable, and always fresh and tastes amazing every time. Would recommend to someone who has a quick lunch but wants good sushi, or if coming for dinner as well."}
{"text":"We will for sure be back in the near future!... Prb tmrw or the next day. Ha The staff is awesome and accommodating, the food is amazing and reasonably priced! Fantastic new sushi place that I hope is around for a long time!"}
{"text":"Not only is this place yummy, it's cheap. When you frequent sushi and are used to spending $60 to $100, it refreshing to find good quality sushi for a good price. Definitely suggest going to eat here. The service is wonderful and it's clean to top."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Yu, the owner of the restaurant, and her team gives the best service to her customers. I have been to many sushi restaurants in Las Vegas and none of them serve fresh seafood like Hiroba. Also, the price is great and that is always a plus! Definitely a must try for anyone who loves sushi!"}
{"text":"An excellent break from standard sushi fare.  They have a bunch of unique rolls including black rice.  The place is really clean and staff is great."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!!!  It's a small little restaurant but it's quite cozy. When you come here order the Geisha roll & Jumping Lobster (baked) also not a bad idea to get the Miso soup and Spicy Garlic Edamame. The service is excellent they have a great menu. This is my go-to for sushi!"}
{"text":"My new fave sushi spot. So reasonably priced. Love the lunch time bento box specials. Uni is so fresh! The ikura is marinated and delicious. Honestly, everything we have tried here (nigiri, sashimi and maki rolls) was very fresh. We didn't try any of the saucy rolls but I'm sure they're good as well. If you're into eel sauce and cream cheese.. I'm sure they have something to tickle your fancy.   Sushi chefs are fun too. Give them a whirl at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with my family and I must admit I am very pleased.  The restaurant was beautiful and very clean the staff is friendly and best of all the food was excellent I will definitely be back often"}
{"text":"So for those of you who see my check-ins, you'll notice I've got a bit of a sushi addiction. I'm seeking help for it. I came across Hiroba Sushi on Yelp, and Yelpers did not disappoint! This little place is tucked away in a little strip mall, and you might miss it driving by. But if you like sushi, you need to STOP IN.  FOOD: This is not an AYCE. Their menu is a la carte and their prices are fair. They have your typical sushi joint variety- sushi roll, hand rolls, sashimi, nigiri... along with a decent hot food menu for the non-sushi lovers. They have great combination lunches and dinners that are well-priced and give you a good amount of food.  I've been here about half a dozen times, and each time I leave full and happy (plus my wallet isn't smoking). Their sashimi is fresh and so tasty, and their salmon belly makes my belly happy. Their nigiri has a good fish-to-rice ratio, and their oyster and quail egg shooters pack a tangy punch with the ponzu and the sake. I also love their Rock and Roll roll which is wrapped in cucumber and huge for the price. Most places charge twice for so much fish. Oh, and they also have fresh wasabi for a small fee if you ask. :)  BOOZE: They have a decent sake menu, and all their beer comes in bottles.   STAFF: The sushi chefs who served me, Jeff and Hank, are awesome. They're attentive and funny and always have good recommendations.  A couple of their servers are the only reason I knocked off a star. They're nice and easy on the eyes, but I always seem to have to ask several times for refills or to ask about the status of my order. You're better off sitting at the bar to get great service.  Other than a little server training, this place needs to become a fixture in your sushi addiction."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for sharing your great reviews on Hiroba!  We have now been four times and each time were very impressed.  We are so impressed this will be our \"go to Sushi place\" going forward!  The prices are great and allow us to go a little overboard and try new rolls yet being loyal to our favorites.  We love the yummy scallop and spicy tuna, just plain sushi rolls but now we can get a couple fun rolls!   Place was busy both times, the service was great for both dine in and take-out."}
{"text":"Love this place. The sushi is great and the price is even better. A hidden gem amongst sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"We go here at least twice a month. This is our go-to spot for NON AYCE sushi. Just enough to hit the spot for tempura udon noodles and a side of plain rolls. Lunch time is a good deal for sashimi plates or sushi plates. The cheesy corn is SOOO good too. The quality is great and the staff are very kind and service is very fast. Thank you for filling us up with goodness every time we're there."}
{"text":"Fast and Exceptional Service especially for a Saturday night. I came in with my husband and toddler for dinner and the kitchen was on point! Prices are pretty affordable and quality is good. We will come back!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi spot! Everything is amazing and staff is so friendly. Our kids love it here! Our favorites are the jackpot and avocado train but EVERYTHING is so fresh and good. The the prices are the best in town. Love everything about Hiroba!"}
{"text":"Hiroba Sushi is a great local casual sushi joint. Prices were very reasonable and quantities generous. The chirashi bowl was essentially a sashimi platter on a bowl of sushi rice with a salad appetizer. The chicken donburi was prepared well but was served late. We tried several sushi rolls - all solid. The ramen is actually a Korean-style kimchi stew with seafood and ramen (made from dried - not fresh - noodles), which is not surprising since the owners are Korean.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"My friend has raved about it. My Yelp buddies have bookmarked and raved about it. Even I bookmarked it. Finally had time to give this place a try. And wow!!!! Thank you \"word-of-mouth!\" Without that, I would've never known about this place!  We came on a Wednesday evening...7pm. This restaurant was pretty full considering it was during the middle of the week. The service was great. They were tentative, constantly keeping our drinks full. Even our sushi rolls arrived quick. We met the female owner...such a sweet lady. She also told me her husband is one of the chefs. She also told me a lot of the chefs she hired worked part time here because they're full time chefs at a few reputable restaurants on The Strip.  We ordered the following rolls:  -spicy tuna-your usual standard roll. Boyfriend and I always gotta start off with this one.  -Spicy Girl: spicy yummy scallop, avocado, cucumber topped with spicy tuna, crispy jalapeno bits, drizzled with spicy mayo and hot sauce. We really enjoyed this one. My favorite of the night.  -Lemon: crab, avocado, cucumber topped with salmon, yellowtail, small lemon slice, sweet onion drizzled with ponzu lemo sauce. This was my boyfriend's favorite. Very refreshing roll. I only ordered this based off the Yelp reviews. Looks like a few reviews have mentioned this roll. Lemon lovers will love this. It's good but just a bit too tangy for my personal tastebuds.  -Japanese Lasagna: yummy scallop, avocado, cream cheese topped with parmesan baked with yum sauce. Drizzled with eel miso sauce, topped with tempura crumbs. We ordered this last because we wanted to eat it immediately....when it's still hot. Anything baked, it's best to eat it fresh. It doesn't taste as good when it's been sitting out for a few minutes while you finish your other rolls. (we learned this by experience).  This was a close favorite. YUMMY!!!!!!  Very pleased with this place. We usually frequent another sushi restaurant across town but this may be our go-to spot right now. Definitely will be back here!"}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant I've found in Vegas so far. I'm a hardcore sushi lover and have found it hard to find a good sushi spot without it being ridiculously overpriced for average sushi. This place has an amazing selection of various types or rolls. Will definitely become a regular and recommend to everyone about this place. 5 stars easily."}
{"text":"SO GOOD!!! The black rice was so awesome and the added health benefits rock! Service was awesome! Totally reasonably priced.  CHECK IT OUT     They put a paper towel around the hot sake and my husband thought that was the coolest thing, not burning his hand pouring us sake bombs haha"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. We are vegan so we only ever order a few things, but their avocado/cucumber rolls as well as their Inari are amazing. We eat here every Sunday because they are so affordable and delicious. They even know me by name"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi! We love the lemon roll, salley roll, and valley of fire. Also the crispy rice with spicy tuna is a great app:). Service is always great and friendly!"}
{"text":"Serving rotten fish and making you pay for it. I don't know how all of these great reviews are on here because I guarantee they paid for them. I left a table full of rotten sushi sitting there and paid for it. Crap customer service and crap food. Steer clear of this POS."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!! We chose to visit here after reading the yelp reviews. PHENOMENAL! I eat sushi often, but never  had rolls made with black rice......the most delicious I have had to date!!!  Our server Jenny,  was not only welcoming and engaging, but she took the time to help us navigate a menu that is familiar, yet possesses just a twist that takes the flavor to the next level. We had the Black Lemon,  Rock & Roll (all yummy fish and no rice), Mang in Black, Megan Bucks, Crispy Black Lotus, and the Jumping Lobster...all delicious! We also had Nigiri sushi, the fish was simply the freshest. Such a wonderful Christmas dinner. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last week for lunch.  It was not busy at all, there were only a few other couples there.  We were given an amazing warm welcome when we first walked in.  Not sure what they said, but it sure sounded nice. ;) We were seated promptly with our drink order being taken immediately.  Our waitress was super sweet and pretty much perfect.  I am not high maintenance in restaurants, all I ask is you check on me once, and don't let my drink go empty.  We were checked on a few times, and our drinks never went empty.  My husband and I both ordered the lunch special which came with a salad and your choice of sushi,roll and entree.  I had the California Roll and Chicken Teriyaki.  My hubby had the Sushi with Salmon Teriyaki.  Both plates were delicious.  I loved the salad dressing, it was different than what I am used to, but very tasty.  Portions were decent and I couldn't finish everything on my plate.  I think they are reasonable priced for the quality which was pretty high, IMO.  A true measure of a great sushi restaurant is great Eel, which I look forward to trying next time.  Two forks up from me!"}
{"text":"My family's favourite place to go. Always great quality of fish. Love the owner sisters. These people care about every single person who walks into their restaurant. I come at least once a week ever since they opened, it's always  a 5 star service."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim because I was interested in finding more sushi places in the SE Vegas area. However, my experience was only so-so. Most of the food items did not seem as fresh as other sushi places in the area. I believe this is because the meat has a smoky flavor on a good portion of the dishes. Some rolls are overly seasoned that distract from the simplicity of a nice sushi dish.  Although I was not a fan of the menu items that I tried, I do believe this place provides great service. Wait staff visited my table at least once every five minutes, keeping my water glass full and asking me how everything tasted.  The answer is that my sushi tasted just okay. However, the prices were kind of cheap, so it's probably a \"you get what you pay for\" experience."}
{"text":"I keep forgetting to review this place, but here goes! The food here is AMAZING, & the service is always great. I think its awesome how friendly the servers treat you, its an awesome atmosphere. The food quality is always consistent and the sushi is FRESH. I am kinda biased cause I always get the Golden Philly roll, but I've tried several of their other dishes and they are always perfectly seasoned. My only complaint is that they are so close to my house, so I'm always here!"}
{"text":"Update: Went for our Weekly Sushi trip and I have to say that the last visit must have been a fluke. Service was amazing, food was excellent and Sashimi tasted like I was living in Hawaii again! We love this place and are so happy we live so close! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. The Lion roll is my favorite. It's affordable and staff is very attentive. If you haven't tried it, make sure you put it on your to do list."}
{"text":"Can't say enough nice things about this place. Staff is friendly and attentive, quick to bring refills and remove plates. The sushi is outstanding. They have converted my wife and I to black rice-it's outstanding. Sitting at the Sushi bar is great as the chefs are as fun as they are talented at preparing the wonderful food!  We make it there AT LEAST once a week and the experience is consistent. They create new rolls and specials all of the time. Some of these have now become our favorites."}
{"text":"Went here twice in the past week. The staff are all very welcoming and give very quick, efficient service. They check on you frequently to make sure that you have everything you need and that everything tastes good but never so much that  it would be annoying or would interrupt your meal. Their offerings are plentiful, varied, and absolutely delicious. I had to try the purple rice and was so glad I did. I had the Geisha and tried the crispy Lotus....just amazing taste and presentation. The prices are low given the high quality and size of the portions. I'm so glad we found this place and will be back often to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Holy hotness you want a hot sushi roll get the sos spicy tuna. I can take the hottest but I had to take a breather with this one.  Ever had black rice? It's the bomb try it here."}
{"text":"I'll never know why the hype at this place...  Been here three times... inconsistent all 3 times.  I usually sit at the bar, the chefs aren't so friendly.   Every time I order the futomaki, they don't make it with the ingredients listed.  It states it has Krab meat, where's the Krab?  Some rolls will come out with no masago, but it states it has masago... what the heck?  Get it together! Don't make such an extensive menu if you don't know the ingredients in your rolls."}
{"text":"Love this place! The service is top notch! You will feel it right when you step in the door. And you can sub the rice for black rice in all sushi and sushi rolls. The black rice is like a healthier version of brown rice, and it tastes better. Not all you can eat. My boyfriend and I usually spend about $60-70 and leave full. The quality of the fish is really good."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place ever. The environment is very nice and cozy. It was very clean. The sushi was super inexpensive and from presentation to taste..it was great. Definitely Going back."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant and it was a awful. First they refused to make a party platter and said we must order each item separately. After complaining they made one of the two platters.  Then they wanted help from us to set up the table. They would not clean the dirty/finished dishes from the table or give us clean plates. All in all it was a lousy experience."}
{"text":"Omg so amazing, first of all the service was so on point, Joey was our server and she was awesome, very patient in explaining everything and so knowledgeable We had the green monster (amazing) the lemon roll (my favorite) and a few other things but those were our favorites, I would highly recommend this place to all sushi lovers we were so impressed! Thank you for an awesome dinner!"}
{"text":"This review is based on 2 late lunch hour visits (around 1:00 PM) only a few days apart. Hiroba Sushi does have an extensive menu with plenty of colorful photos (including vegan choices), but I had to subtract a star for inconsistent quality with the non-sushi items. The black rice was fantastically delish when I first tried it, but on my second visit, it tasted old...like the cook was using rice left over from the night before. I may need to give the black rice another chance to see if that was just a fluke because I don't know what other Asian restaurants offer this healthier rice option. If you want more flavorful shortribs, stick to the Korean places. Also, the honey teriyaki chicken appetizer was a little tough to chew, blandly sweet, and didn't seem to have much teriyaki-ness to it. I ordered the honey potato chips out of curiosity, and I think I would've liked it better if there had been less honey soaking the chips.  I don't eat sashimi or any raw seafood so my ratings are for the cooked sushi items. I loved the Green Monster (more pink crab than green avocado), but I could only finish half of it because of the large size! I ended up eating the other half for breakfast the next morning. Both Dragon and Spider Man rolls had generous amounts of filling, and the white sushi rice tasted really fresh.  The waitresses were attentive and friendly, and actually remembered me when I came back the second time. This kind of service and food quality is why I don't mind paying a la carte prices rather than AYCE!"}
{"text":"Good Value and Good Service! I'll be back. There were 4 of us and we ordered all kinds of stuff from appetizers to sushi to rolls to a rice bowl with bulgogi.    We weren't keen on the edamame or the shrimp tempura... the edamame seemed \"mushy\" like it was frozen and then overcooked... and the shrimp tempura was small and again seemed like it came it was a pre-made item that had been frozen....I'd suggest you pass on these two.  But everything else we had was Tasty!  And the pricing for most of the rolls were $8!  I thought this was a good deal considering rolls at other places in town start at $10!  :)  The gyoza was excellent... very meaty and served hot.  The wrapper was perfect... not too thick and not too thin and was cooked so it had a light crunch while the insides were moist and meaty. Nice! We also got the Blue Fin tuna and Toro sushi.  Really fresh!  I loved the Blue Fin and my girl friend loved the Toro.  So, win-win.  :) And then we ordered a few different rolls (3 or 4)... I can't remember all of them but I do remember that they were nicely prepared and presented... and had great flavors! And More Importantly....were NOT drowning in sauce.  This is a HUGE PLUS for me since I do NOT like my rolls swimming in sauce like some other places like to do.    The rice bowl with bulgogi was excellent!  The meat was flavorful and there was lots of it.    We also had a few beers... and our total before tip was $108 and we were all very full when we left.  :)  The wait staff and manager were attentive and helpful. They all had a smile on their face and made sure we had food and drinks.    What was nice is that we put our order in piece-meal.  Meaning, we started with a couple things and then would order something else and then a few minutes later order another thing... it went on like this for our entire meal.  That way we could gauge how much more we wanted to eat rather than ordering it all up front and then having too much food.  LOL!  Staff was totally on board with us doing this.  :)"}
{"text":"This is our second visit here and we continue to be impressed. Very good. Black lemon roll with nutritious black rice, butterfly roll, rainbow row, rock and roll and on and on. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick roll to satisfy my sushi craving with my fiancé. Took a seat at the sushi bar and one of the waitresses immediately helped us out. The entire time we were here everyone was great. Other than the sushi being phenomenal so was the service. Thank you all from Hiroba Sushi. I will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Hiroba is the best place to get black rice.  Great service!! Best price!!  Hiroba is the best place to get black rice.  Great service!! Best price!!"}
{"text":"higher end sushi at affordable prices. Friendly staff, quick service, large menu. Try the rolls with black rice!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Staff was attentive and friendly and place had a warm neighborhood feel. The fish was of surprisingly great quality considering that it is a local restaurant in a residential area. The dishes were inventive and the use of black Forbidden Rice was amazing! This is our new favorite local gem!"}
{"text":"Great new sushi place in Henderson. We ordered the bento box and it was yummy. Reasonably priced and great service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Henderson. You get great sushi and the prices I think are pretty unbeatable. The lemon roll is the most refreshing bite and service is great. My only complaint is the wine list but other then that you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Update:  I have never been so sick from eating a couple of bites of anything! Diarrhea and vomiting. My wife is sick as well. It was almost instant! That goes to show how bad their food really is!!!!  Unbelievable! We were just here and their sushi has to be the worst I have ever had. Anything with crab in it no matter if it was spicy or not was bad. I have eaten sushi all over the country and never once have had anything this horrid. I am standing here with leyna and she is absolutely not accommodating. We left nearly everything on the table and get argued with by this woman. Be careful if you go here! Raw fish is already risky enough but add in old raw fish and it is a recipe for disaster! Honestly yelpers what were you thinking when you rated this place so high? Do they serve 10 day old fish all the time?"}
{"text":"OMG THIS PLACE IS SOOOOOO GOOD... Myself and my wife have been looking for some place to have good sushi and we found it.... i am in love with everthing that i ordered cant wait to come back..... And the service amazing....we will return soon thank you for a great experience!!!! Our new family..."}
{"text":"Beautiful presentation and an above average selection and you won't be disappointed nor would your guests...BUT...if you a true SUSHI-ER...who likes to see the product and watch your dish being made...this is not the place."}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi.  I love the atmosphere and the sushi is great.  I return often and recommend it."}
{"text":"My new sushi spot! Love the geisha roll. The staff is really friendly and the place is very clean. The green salad is a creamy dressing which isn't my personal favorite."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. I come here once a week! Very friendly staff, the owners also work there and are very friendly. Food is great, prices are great. I won't go anywhere else on this side of town. Thanks Hiroba for your hospitality and great food!"}
{"text":"This place sucks! It's expensive and the rolls are filled with imitation crab the Sushi chefs were kind of rude. Not planning on ever going back."}
{"text":"Great sushi and udon.  We come here at least once a week if we can.  Try one of the black rice sushi rolls, you will not go wrong.  My 7 yr old son hates udon at other restaurants but loves the udon here and usually orders 2 bowls!"}
{"text":"To get 5 stars from me is hard. For 5 stars you need to meet: great atmosphere, great staff, great music, great food, cleanliness, and the place must \"flow.\"   Came in the day after Christmas. Place is very clean, friendly staff, and got seated quickly. The food was good and came out in a reasonable time. The food was warm, but not hot like how I like it. Also, the Sake was warm, but the waiter asked us if it was warm or hot. We told him it was warm, so he took it back and gave us a hot bottle. The Udon was very good and super HOT! Overall, if your looking for good food at a reasonable price and great music, come and you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Although we live about 16 minutes away from this place, and pass about 5 sushi places on the way, we decided to give Hiroba a try and are so glad we did!  We ordered take-out and it was all so fresh and perfect.  We ordered: garlic edamame, chicken Udon (without the broth - add teriyaki sauce - for our 2 year old), spicy tuna, spider roll, 3 orders of salmon nigiri, Black rice Black Lemon roll, and Anthem roll and Oh my Gosh it was all SO GREAT!  The two specialty rolls were fantastic but the other items were all superior to our regular sushi places closer to home.  The take-out orders were all exact, complete with all sauces and drizzles on the side in individual containers, plus soy sauces and chopsticks.  Nothing was missing or substituted.  We will definitely be making this drive from now on to have sushi!  (*salmon is farmed raised here, as is all local sushi places here.)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and this is my first time going here. The presentation of the food was very nice and service was quick and friendly. I definitely recommend this if you want Japanese food."}
{"text":"This place is just \"ok\". The sushi is good, but not outstanding (like Miko's was), and I really like the special black rice. I've sat at the bar a few times, and the chefs are not particularly friendly. They just don't engage with people, except maybe a few \"favorites\". The tempura is heavily breaded and a bit greasy. The calamari is frozen (and tastes like it), and the soft-shell crab left much to be desired. Some of the cold apps had too much sauce, and they charge you for \"fresh\" wasabi ($2.00 for a small bowl).   The service is inconsistent: either they disappear or they hover. The food comes out very fast, so it's hard to sit an enjoy (however, if you want to grab some sushi quickly, then this might be good for that). Every time we've gone there, I felt like they were just trying to get us served and out the door as quickly as possible; \"turn & burn\". Last time, we were not even offered dessert. The waitress smiled, but was rude. During our last visit, she asked if we'd like anything else, and before we could answer, she was already walking away."}
{"text":"Really really delicious sushi. We had a dragon roll and spicy tuna. It was inexpensive and delicious with good service. I recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"I have visited my relative house in Henderson and our family decided to try this place since it has highest stars in Yelp. TRUELY and HONESTLY I feel like I was deceived by overly rated Yelpers!!!   PLEASE if you want to eat quality sushi please don't waste your money and time. I was mad and stomach sick after I had their sushi and sashimi. I couldn't understand Yelper who gave 5 stars!!!! Are you kidding me???  I have been eating sushi for all my life but this place was worst of all. I do not want to be mean but this is only place I give one star in Yelp because it is so overly rated by some people.   First, I didn't understand sushi restaurant with no sushi case on display!! Customers look at fish in the sushi case to know whether their fish is fresh or not. I was suspicious but I tried anyway. WRONG decision!! NEVER coming back! I am telling you sushi is raw fish and need to be fresh that's why I am so particular about sushi restaurant!!!  This place is WORST sushi restaurant I ever been!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Food and service was great. The prices are much better than other area spots. Look forward to going again!"}
{"text":"Service, and venue were great. I do recommend the green monster and miso, however, a lot of their rolls have mayo based sauces. They lack firmness and seem mushy. Flavorful mish, but can be a challenge to eat for a person bothered by texture. Also, there house salad only offers one type of dressing that they make which also is mayo based. It tastes very much like mayo mixed with powdered sugar.  It is very sweet!"}
{"text":"Wow, I have no idea why I've never tried this restaurant before. I've lived on this side of town for a year or more, and this always shows up when I search for food places on Yelp. Finally tried it last night, and I can say I'm a fan! I've never tried the black rice on sushi before, and I don't know what it is about it, but it's tasty! Their fish is fresh as I could tell, and the cuts are not small. I'm amazed because I'm not sure how they can keep them so inexpensive. Their nigiri, regular rolls and such items, are totally cheap! But they certainly don't taste cheap.   The Purple Dream roll --- so NOM. It's a great summer roll. Refreshing, and robust flavors but nothing too overwhelming. Salmon Lover --- another NOM... I love salmon though so I'm biased :) Fatty Tuna sashimi comes with fresh wasabi... delicious.  I can go on and on, but you get the idea. I can't wait to try them again."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi home joint ... so good and fresh sushi here! Excellent shrimp tempura.  A lot of locals hang out here! Call ahead to reserve for a bigger group.  We love the owners (really nice) and the staff here is friendly and fast!  Nice neighborhood sushi place - come try it! You'll like it!!"}
{"text":"We love this place for robust sushi rolls menu, interesting flavors, and great service. Prices are better than other places, and quality is great! We have tried black rice rolls which were delicious! Green monster is a must try - interesting combination of soft shell crab, rice, avocado, and eel sauce. Their menu is big for every taste with supreme quality. This is our new locals favorite!"}
{"text":"3rd time here and fish is ALWAYS FRESH! Service and food quality is always on point! Today I ordered the salmon, yellowtail, blue fin (recommended by the server) , and Uni Sashimi! All were delicious! The chef also gave us a special on the house corn egg shooter which totally blew me away! The place is always clean and friendly! I will definitely be back! Thank you Hiroba!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience.  Both sushi chefs were great.  Their food was A+ and so was the service.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped by for dinner last night and it was hot...not the experience, but that the heater was on blast.  Too hot...but another couple from the next table over commented on it and they lowered the heat.  Hubby ordered the following orders of nigiri: - 2 uni - 2 Super White - 2 Scallops (though the waiter called it ika, which is squid...) - 1 Hamachi - 1 Saba - 1 salmon and a Natto Roll  He also ordered fresh wasabi, which is a $2 upcharge.  I couldn't eat any of the raw stuff at this time, so I picked two rolls: - shrimp tempura - spider  My eyes were scanning through the menu for any items that do not have an asterisk (footnote that this is raw, yadeeyadeeya), but unfortunately, that is it accurate as I noted that the Golden Philadelphia Roll contain raw salmon but there was no asterisk.  I'd even confirmed with the waiter that this is raw and he said yes.  I wanted to end dinner with the montblanc, but after 10 minutes, was told that they were out.  The montblanc was on our bill when we received it, so we had to let them know that we never received it.  Our meal was over $60 pre-tip, and though hubby said the fish was fresh, it was all comparable to the AYCE Sushi House Goyemon.  I still believe Goyemon reign supreme.  Because this place is quite new (the previous 2 tenants, a family eatery and a sub place, didn't last very long at this very same location), the service was slow and two of the waitstaff ran around like chickens with their head cutoff.    Will we return...probably not, but, this place is A-OK."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi place on this side of town. The owners, chefs, and staff are all awesome. We dine in and take out often. Their fish is excellent and prices are very reasonable. The selection on their menu as well as the black rice options are excellent. Don't forget their hot food items, those are great too.  All in all, they run an excellent restaurant and they truly put their customers first.  We're regulars and there's nothing that will change that."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here and I dine in, it was my daughter birthday we had mention that and the waitress were we're all so nice to her asked her what kind of ice cream she likes. I ordered two sashimi lunch at $10.50 each what a deal and it was yummy! After we finish they bought out her tempura fried ice cream with a candle. Sweet definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly great! Loving their black rice rolls, especially their Salsa dancing roll and great service, higly recommended!"}
{"text":"A gem of a place in a sea of sushi places! They made accommodations on the menu to suit my picky kids. My tea was always hot and filled. Service was prompt! This will be my new place!"}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI IVE EVER HAD!!!!! Super cheap, staff is incredibly nice, and the food is out of this world. Green Monster is a must have, it's a life altering sushi dish. Huge menu, barely anything is over $10.99, & have yet to try a bad roll or have any kind of bad tasting ingredients or fish that wasn't fresh. If you live here in Vegas, or are visiting, it's an absolute MUST to travel off the strip & go to Hiroba for sushi."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is relaxed, the food excellent, and the sushi chefs entertaining. I was a bit irritated in the beginning for having to wait so long to even place an order while sitting at the bar. Once the chefs decided who was going to take us, the rest of the visit was great. Love the black rice!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place.  The service is excellent , great prices and the food is very good. Highly recommend the place.  Arigato!"}
{"text":"This just became my favorite sushi place....not only nice staff....but amazingly fresh and tasty sushi...I would recommend this place to all fellow sushi hounds"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Amazing food. No complaints. Check it out. Staff gave us a free house salad which was also delicious. Green monster & spicy rainbow rolls were unlike any others I've ever had. Please try this place."}
{"text":"Went on yelp looking for a good sushi place in Henderson, and I pleasantly surprised. I got the geisha roll and it was awesome. My dad wouldn't shut up about how good the toro was so there's that too. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered alot of things thru Doordash. Everything tasted great and was very fresh! Order came earlier than expected as well, can't wait to try this place again soon!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants here in town, this is one of the best! Great quality , very clean , and everyone including the sushi chefs are very friendly! Prices are very reasonable. I was very pleased and will definitely be going back! :)"}
{"text":"Decided to give Hiroba another try and so glad we did! Came back twice since the first time and both time had excellent meals. Sashimi very fresh, found several new rolls we really liked. Spicy girl is excellent! Atmosphere and service great. Will definitely will  be back, now that the quality of fish is up to par:)"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here for a multitude of reasons: excellent sushi, great service, and a friendly clean atmosphere. Well worth the drive from across town.  Ordered the yellowtail roll, screaming O salad, spicy garlic edamame, and the mango salmon roll (it comes with walnuts too!) and they were all amazing. No shortcuts taken at this off the strip sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!  Decided to try this place out based on Yelp reviews. Yelpers were spot on, this place did not disappoint. We ordered an appetizer and several rolls. Everything was so fresh and flavorful making it hard to pick a favorite.  Oh wait did I mention the wait staff??? Incredibly friendly and very prompt, we never had to ask for a thing! This is now our new go-to sushi spot."}
{"text":"I had an excellent time here. Food and service were amazing. We had the lemon roll and the rainbow roll, both of which tasted awesome and fresh. We purchased another lemon roll to take home but it wasn't complete. Make sure you check your rolls before heading home if you swing by to pick something up on the way home."}
{"text":"Loved the food here, very different selections and they have their own black rice. Our server Agnes was great!! She had awesome recommendation would definitely go back soon"}
{"text":"It was my first time and upon walking in I expected the typical sushi experience you would get from a small mom and pop spot. However, they exceeded my expectations completely. Their customer service was on point and food was of quality that you would find at a sushi spot on the strip. The staff refilled our tea every time it almost reached half full, they immediately removed our plates when something was completed and they made sure we had everything we needed at all times. We ordered the seaweed salad, screaming O salad, mango salmon, spicy garlic edamame, and a few others. The seaweed salad was fresh and full of flavor and was of generous portions. Out of all the menu items, the mango salmon was my favorite. I love that it comes with salmon and generous portions of mango on top and in the roll. If you try this roll, I highly suggest only eating it with the sauce on the plate (dip it in) and adding one of the toasted nuts on top of each bite.   I can't wait to come back and try more options."}
{"text":"I was visiting out of town from LA and needed to grab a bite to eat before the drive back. I was a little hesitant going after skimming their big menu, noting their cheap prices and realizing I was eating sushi in the middle of a dessert. Boy was I wrong.  We LOVED the lemon roll, crispy rice spicy tuna (so many pieces) and yellowtail sashimi. Their ponzu sauce was my favorite. Not only was the sushi delicious but the staff was extremely sweet and went out of their way to make us comfortable. They even brought us free tea when I mentioned feeling cold.   This is not for the \"sugarfish\" kind of sushi fan (which i'm not)...but for the rest of us who enjoy this thing called sushi in a different way...this place is a must try.  Cannot wait for my next trip to Vegas just to stop by here again!"}
{"text":"This sushi place is clean and casual and the workers and owners are nice people.  Hiroba is the only sushi place in town that uses black rice.  I've never heard of black rice until I tried it at Hiroba Sushi and it's sweet and tasty!  They offer noodle and rice plates for those people in your group that don't like sushi.  It's a great compromise between me and my boyfriend.  Menu prices are reasonable without sacrificing quality.  Sashimi is always tastes fresh and they usually have unique fish specials, like toro (which you would probably only find in a fancy restaurant on Las Vegas Blvd).  The 4-star rating is based mainly on the quality of the food and cleanliness of the restaurant.  Waiter service is mediocre, but the sushi chefs are excellent if you sit at the bar.  Again, this is a casual restaurant so don't expect it be some 5-star restaurant.  This is my favorite sushi place in town and will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in this place. The server was rushing us and the rolls were pretty bland. Also, my beer was expired and tasted shitty. We will stick to our usual spot, Spicy Tuna, on Horizon Ridge. Do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoyed Hiroba Sushi! We ordered sushi and sashimi combo and salmon sashimi. The food was really fresh and delicious(especially the fish), and although the restaurant was very full and busy, the staff was very friendly and helpful, fulfilling our needs. The restaurant was very clean. Will definitely eat again here."}
{"text":"Does the job, but it won't be a place I'm going to crave. I hate giving low ratings if I thought a place is play, I'll usually give like 3 stars, but the more I think of this place the more dissatisfied I feel and I literally just walked out an hour ago.   My boyfriend and I were looking for a sushi place in Henderson, so we decided to try this place out.   Service: usually waitresses wait to ask if we're ready when we're not looking at the menu, but 2 min after we sat someone asked us if we're ready. Then when we were still obviously discussing the menu, they came back again. I'm not sure if it's because I was really sleepy and hungry, but it really annoyed me. Please just wait until we're obviously ready. Thank you.   We got a golden Philadelphia, aba island, and green monster.  I can't blame them for the Philadelphia because that pick was just way too basic to even judge them on, considering Albertsons serves the same thing.  Aba island was probably our best choice. I really enjoyed the garlic chips on top. The second star is for this roll, or it possibly might have been one star.  Green monster looked really popular so we had to try it. It was okay. I liked it in the beginning, but I really just got tired of it 1/3 way through and at that point I was just eating it to help finish it.   I had high hopes, but I'm not sure if I'll be back. Maybe one day I'll try the black lemon roll, but it probably won't be for awhile."}
{"text":"I just stopped into this place while in town on business, but it did not disappoint. The sushi was delicious and very affordable. The service was great and everyone who worked there was quite friendly."}
{"text":"this place has definitely claimed it's fame on my list of \"regular sushi spots.\"  let's begin. so I've never been here before, my roommate and her boyfriend decided to take me out since I was having a rough week. they were raving about it for two weeks about how amazing the sushi was. we decided to start off with sake bombs. the one sushi chef counted down the moment (and multiple other moments) for us and the energy in the restaurant was getting turnt up. if you need a pick me up - the environment here is definitely upbeat and fun. Youh was the sweetest. she was attentive and made great suggestions :)    it's safe to say that the food was no less than incredible. quality of ingredients was so fresh, you thought they just caught the fish themselves. the \"green monster\" was this ball of crab, avocado and some other amazing stuff. a different kind of dish, I couldn't stop picking at it cause it was just that good. my second favorite was the lemon roll that the lovely youh suggested to us. if you're into citrus or a tart taste experience, definitely try that roll. don't forget to finish your dinner with dessert. the strawberry ice cream was totally on point."}
{"text":"Unfortunately Yelp let me down on this one - a coworker and I had this place on our bucket list for a while due to the seemingly good reviews. We ordered the chirashi as well as some nigiri and unfortunately some of the fish was just not fresh, and overall the fish quality was a clear step below even nearby local alternatives. I get that some of the nigiri is pretty inexpensive and other Yelpers have rated this place high based on value, but the chirashi at ~$20 wasn't good value given no special selections were included in our spread - it was just standard, run-of-the-mill sashimi cuts.  Service was OK; refills on tea and water were efficient, but our experience was also diminished by our waitress' lack of familiarity with her own restaurant's menu, which made her unhelpful for recommendations and ordering assistance. Additionally, she seemed unaware of the distinction between \"chutoro\" and \"otoro\" (the menu simply said \"toro\" and I'm not usually a fan of \"otoro\" as I find it too fatty), and worse yet appeared annoyed when we asked if she could check with the sushi chef.  Solely because of the good reviews by other Yelpers, I may give this place a second chance and update should my experience improve - but honestly, even the money I'd save with the \"value\" nigiri lauded by some other reviewers isn't appealing when I know I will consistently get better fish at other nearby sushi spots."}
{"text":"Great sushi place!  And you can get sushi for $2.99!! Can't beat that! Ambiance is nice too.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. The crispy rice was sooo yummy!!! The garlic edamame was amazing too. Everything was very well flavored. The girls are so sweet as well."}
{"text":"Sometimes when I dine out, I expect my comfort level eating in any establishment to be Paramount. Unfortunately I did experienced the exact opposite here. From the second I walked in, me and my roommate were bombarded by servers which is not a bad thing but when the \"new girl\" hands you the menu, stands there without giving you a nanosecond to even collect your thoughts and pressures to take your order from the moment you sit down. It poises to make for a level of discomfort and awkwardness.   Things escalated for the worse when I asked for their yummy sauce and she brought me a little dish of plain Mayo. Who puts plain mayo on their rolls?   When Jenny another server walked by & said to me \"Wow you like Mayo on your rolls? I proceeded to let her know that was not what I asked for and that I was looking for the yummy sauce.   The \"new girl\" then rushed over and was not only condescending to the max, she rolled her eyes at me and was very aggressive and beyond rude implying that it was my fault and that I wanted just plain ole mayo. This was sushi not a turkey sandwich for crying out loud! I felt immediately uncomfortable and it was not a good feeling.   Then to add insult to injury my Teriyaki Salmon I ordered was under-cooked and half raw almost rubbery like in texture. I had to notify the manager who took the bento box off my bill but instead of apologizing for my awful experience she stood up for the server and kept saying \"It's her first day here\" like it was a free hall pass for her awful service & attitude.  I get it, first days on the job can be stressful but there is absolutely no excuse for her horrible and rude attitude and eyes rolling bitchiness. I don't care if it's your first day or last day on the job, there is no excuse for rude service.  We work really hard for our money and at the end of the week expect good customer service in any industry.   Not only was the food quality poor, everything overtly loaded with MSG, sugar and sodium, sushi rice falling apart and under cooked Teriyaki Salmon. The rainbow roll fell apart and the fish did not taste fresh at all.    I know Japanese food is loaded with MSG but this was overkill and the honey teryiaki chicken my roommate ordered was beyond salty, sugary and toxic tasting almost.   They had too many servers working and the system is to bombard the diners every 5 seconds with a different server which makes for a VERY awkward in your face invasive dining experience.   There were no PROS at all and nothing but CONS. I wish this business luck but they really need to revise their customer service and come up with a better strategy of winning repeat customers because I would not come back here even if the food was for free. The worst sushi restaurant I've ever experienced.  Service - 0 Food Quality - 0 Overall Experience - negative 0  out of 5 stars !!"}
{"text":"What a great sushi place!!!  Everything we had was fresh and excellent tasting. Highly recommend salsa dancing, pastel, and pink lady rolls.  Do yourself a favor and sit at the bar...the sushi chefs have a great personality and make it a fun experience...Ours was Jeff tonight and he was great!   Ask him for a \"Shooter, right now!\" When you get there...It's another great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is good! I had it bookmarked for a while and finally, the boyfriend and I had a chance to make it here. The sushi is really good. I tend to judge a sushi place by the availability of natto and they have it here. You almost never find natto at an AYCE place, but I've ordered 3 rolls already.   Although they are not all you can eat, their rolls are reasonably priced. We ended up getting calamari roll and jackpot roll and liked them both. We also got combination yaki soba which had a nice, subtle flavor. Not as good as other places, though. Also got the spicy garlic edamame, which had just the right amount of kick to it.   The restaurant is clean, well lit, has some good music, and the people are nice. I am sure my boyfriend and I will be back."}
{"text":"The service was the best all the waitresses super nice and very welcoming.  The food was tasty and price was reasonable.  Will highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Had a work team outing here for lunch.  Ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box along with green monster. The green monster was super yummy! Bento box was good except the chicken was a bit hard.   We went around 12:30pm and it wasn't too busy, just how I like it.   Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Read all the yelp reviews and decided to come here.  We were the first patrons of the day, and hence the place was empty...  Ordered a sashimi lunch, a teri chicken donburi, and some tamago & saba nigiri.  Let's face it we are in the desert, and fish is not exactly pulled right out of the sea.  The sashimi was not the freshest I have had, though it was still very good.  Likewise with the saba, not super oily like you would expect it to be, but still very good.  The teri chicken donburi was on the larger size, and very moist, but little too much char for me.  Service was excellent.  Our waitress and what I presume to be the owner were both very friendly and attentive.  My only real gripe was the salad that came with my meal.  It was cold and crisp... But they really need to invest in a salad spinner!  There was so much water on the lettuce that there was a kiddie pool at the bottom of my bowl.  Likewise it made the salad dressing diluted and also didn't stick to the salad.  I will be back though!  Other than the disappointing salad, everything else was well done, and as best as could be given we are in the desert, and not on an island in the pacific."}
{"text":"Was great, prices good and service excellent. The golden California was so good. Have to try once but I will try once a month for sure."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurant in town for me. Prices are affordable, the sushi chefs and staff are really friendly and the food is fresh and well mastered. Definitely a place I would recommend !!!"}
{"text":"Newly opened Japanese restaurant in Anthem ~  Decided to swing by for dinner tonight after reading rave reviews off Yelp. Yelpers are right, great spot! Glad I checked it out.   Price is great, food prepared neat and fresh.   Great customer service from the staff - professional, friendly and attentive.   Being my first visit, didn't order a ton of rolls to try out but will eventually. Ordered my go-to favs.   Looks like I Love Sushi has competition. I usually go there for sushi but this restaurant is another great option.   Keep up the great service, I'll see you soon ~"}
{"text":"I am an all you can eat sushi fan and this place is not ACYE so I was skeptical.   So glad I tried this place! Every roll we had was very good and the prices are very reasonable. The waiters are very friendly too. Will definitely be back.   The white spider roll was probably my favorite! The miso cream sauce was different and delicious.   Oyshi roll was my second favorite.   Great sushi all around!"}
{"text":"I love hiroba. Great food and friendly staff. I always feel welcome here. Usually go with the special box which gives you salad, miso soup, a California or spicy tuna roll, and a good selection of entreés to choose from."}
{"text":"First off black rice sushi is awesome and this is my first time trying it.  Second, the staff was so friendly and accommodating.  I got the seafood black fried rice and of course a lion roll.  I'll for sure come back!"}
{"text":"Arguably the best sushi in Las Vegas. Inventive ingredients and ample portions of fish in comparison to the rice are a welcome change. Speaking of rice, they incorporate black rice into most rolls - a complete game changer. Black rice is plump with a nutty sweet flavor and it makes all the difference. I recommend the Geisha, Valley of Fire, Anthem, Purple Dream, Alien, and the Hiroba Poki."}
{"text":"If you want some bomb ass sushi accompanied with excellent customer service, go no further than Eastern. The fish is fresh, the selection was perfect, and the atmosphere is very nice. The interior is nice, clean and modern. The owner is super nice and funny! And the prices are fair. I had the Green Monster and almost got full off it. I also had the Dragon roll which was tasty. They weren't drenched in sauce like some places, which is nice! I will definitely come here again!  11/10"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place, my family and I refer to it as are usual because it is! The shrimp tempura roll and the deep fried Hawaiian roll are definitely staples with a flavor wanting you to come back for more. Everyone who works there is so nice, and welcome you back each time"}
{"text":"Great service and the fish was fresh. No all you can eat option, but the prices are VERY reasonable. The place is also very clean and the food presentation was on point. We had spicy girl roll, yellow tail, tako sashimi, oysters, salmon collar and the daily special which was fresh toro that melted in your mouth. Portions were great. Great chefs who did sake shots with us. This is going to be my new sushi place. Hopefully the prices remain as is if they don't offer all you can eat. I will be back a lot because it's just steps away from my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Hiroba since a few months after they opened and they have quickly taken over as my go-to lunch spot. The staff is always incredibly friendly and attentive, even when I have to get takeout and return to my desk.   The sushi is great. Everything is very fresh and flavorful. Everything - even their \"fancy\" stuff - is reasonably priced. I'm definitely going to find a way to have Hiroba cater at some point. The black rice rolls are fantastic. They also don't cut the fish on the nigiri sushi super thin. At $2.99 per order this is honestly surprising. I've paid more than twice as much for half the fish.  I usually get the sushi lunch, but I've also tried (and loved) most of the sushi on their menu. As others have mentioned, the Green Monster is great despite the Red Sox reference. The Tiger roll is also great as is the Black Lemon. I did have the unfortunate experience of one of my friends ordering and making me try the Italian roll. I assumed it was one of those joke menu items. Not something I would try again. But pretty much anything else is solid.  Recently they changed their menu a little bit and now have sections for people with food allergies. My wife can't eat gluten and sushi is always iffy because of the soy sauce in things like eel sauce. Having all the gluten free options in one place is really helpful. They also have vegetarian and shellfish free options as well."}
{"text":"Mexican hand roll, seaweed salad, yellowtail sashimi, and a soft shell crab appetizer. All very good until the soft shell crab, but that's almost always a miss at sushi joints. The atmosphere is awkward, random music genres playing but tvs over the bar. I opted for the booth at first but they are uncomfortable so we ended up at the bar. Better service anyway, John Y, probably the head chef, was attentive and made my things fast. Some of the chefs behind the bar seemed a little confused and flustered, many things were dropped which was agitating. No AYCE option, but the prices are out of this world. No where have I seen handrolls for 2.50! I believe our server at the bar was the woman who owns it and she immediately took off the crab because I said it was okay and without a word she removed it. I appreciate good customer service and you'll get it here. Maybe I'll try a maki roll next time. Their menu is HUGE and they have fruit rolls which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!  This is sushi like you have never seen.  So creative, so fresh, so delicious.  Make this your only stop for sushi in Vegas."}
{"text":"Vegas has great sushi at very low (all you can eat) prices.  This place is a little pricier than those cheap AYCE places, but it is actually worth it.  Excellent quality fish and well constructed rolls.  They also offer black rice which is a huge plus.  Also, fatty tuna is available which is something AYCE places generally do not have."}
{"text":"This is some of the best sushi I've had in Vegas. Arrived right when they opened so no reservation needed for lunch. However, it did crowd up a bit come 12-12:30.  The baked mussels and salmon nigiri were my favorites. I like to keep it simple. The salmon was fresh and tasted like toro. They have lunch plates you can also order. If you have hungry eyes like me, you might over order.. so be careful.. it can get expensive.  Service was good and legit.. it felt and tasted pretty authentic. It was also nice that they asked if we wanted separate checks off the bat.   The drive is a little far since it's in Anthem. Worst part is dealing with the traffic off the freeway on Eastern so allow yourself a little time to travel here."}
{"text":"I tried them after the first disasterous time and they are actually pretty good.  I love their black rice options and they have an extensive menu.  So I think they're pretty good!"}
{"text":"Delicious cuisine in a clean friendly atmosphere. The cool 70s rock sound track and low prices make this joint a great casual spot for lunch. Sushi and teriyaki bowls I've had have been excellent.  Really great food."}
{"text":"3.6       So many sushi spots in Henderson, more than I expected.    So mom refuses to eat sushi without me so she waited until I came to visit and here was our time. We came for lunch on a Sunday. This place is located in a non descript industrial ish shopping mall.  We walked in and were greeted immediately. We were able to sit wherever we liked and we sat in the booth. Service was nice and the whole vibe in there was chill and we loved their light fixtures. Very modern feel.    So we looked over the menu and the have ALOT of maki roll options. I'm usually not a roll fan but I as persuaded to get on of their specials and my Mom was drooling over the pictures on Yelp of their dish called the Green monster. So that was a no brainer to order this :)  We also ordered , soft shell crab, scallop dynamite, ono sashimi, shrimp killer roll and one of their specials which I forgot the name.     SO, the critique of the food.  The soft shell crab and scallop dynamite came out first. The soft shell was actually one of the most disappointing soft shells I've had.  It wasn't crispy enough and the consistency was just off.  The scallop dynamite looked yummy and my mom enjoyed it. It could have been thicker or used to be a topper on a bed of rice.  The prices of their ono sashimi were more than reasonable. I was so happy they had Ono, because 9 times out of 10, places list it on the menu but never have it! Pisses me off. They had it, it was fresh and cut nice and thick! So damn good, I should have ordered two orders. Gotta get this fish when I can!  My mom's shrimp killer was made neat but could have been saucier. This was a little dry for her liking.  The green monster was BOMB, it was like a dome filled with crab meat and the outer was sliced avocado, tempura flakes and fried onions with a nice drizzle of eel sauce and spicy Japanese mayo. My mom made love to this and enjoyed it so much she took the rest home :p  I'd get this again easily. My specialty dish was crispy black rice topped with spicy tuna, lotus chips, wasabi roe and a lovely drizzle of eel sauce and Japanese mayo. This was good and I loved the fact that the crispy rice as cut super thick like most crispy rice dishes. Nice texture of crunchy and smooth with the spicy tuna.       This place is super authentic but it satisfied my mom's American maki sushi cravings and that's all that matters to me :p"}
{"text":"Love this. Excellent service. Very attentive. Tried the purple dream. So fresh and I love the citrus flavor. Husband tried the sashimi. Cajun albacore. He loved it.   I'm so happy to have found a good sushi place in Henderson. Most of the time we have to go to the strip."}
{"text":"Dad and I walked into this place on the reviews from yelp. We were sat immediately, pretty casual place! Looks great for lunch or dinner. We got a large range of sushi and appetizers and it was all delicious! The staff were very friendly and always checking on us. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Only thing dad said was the beer could have been a little colder haha"}
{"text":"We LOVE Hiroba!! We love the green monster, the geisha, the crispy black lotus, and the Vegas roll. If you love vegetables, the cucumber salad and the Vegetable Rock and Roll are super yummy!! The staff at Hiroba is great!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My new favorite Henderson sushi. They have such amazing prices and they have black rice which is so delicious. They have a gluten free menu too"}
{"text":"This is a great new place in the area for sushi, and being new in an area highly populated with sushi restaurants, it needs to step it's customer service game just up a bit (not there's anything wrong, but there's a lot of yummy sushi competitors close). We were seated quickly and the waiter took our order in a timely manner.   The sushi tastes fresh and chef does a good job with the flavors of the food we ordered. The price is reasonable for what you get. We ordered sashimi, two rolls, green mussels, tempura udon, and hot sake - our bill was only $47.   The udon noodle soup was extremely hot and delicious - enough food to be a meal in itself. The green mussels were good, but came out warm, not hot.  The first bottle of hot sake came out warm and had a hairline crack in the bottle. When we informed the waiter, he replaced it immediately. He came back and asked if it was hot, which it wasn't, so he replaced it with a hot bottle. All of the sushi tasted fresh.   This may be my new go-to sushi close by."}
{"text":"Well this place is the best around this area that I have had. I Love Sushi was what I heard you have to go.. Which I have server all times and the food is always good but the craziness to get a table and the owner who doesn't let his people do their job makes it uneasy. My point is the food here is amazing, they staff is great and they have fun with the customers and no one is yelling at the staff.. I don't feel like a child in a disruptive home. So if you want great food, friendly staff, welcoming atmosphere and a pocket friendly bill try this place out you won't be disappointed!  We had oh my roll, monkey brain and jumping lobster, lg saki, 2 lg beers and 2 pieces of tuna on their special black rice, which was great! $44 bucks!!"}
{"text":"A nicely furnished, intimate restaurant with a warm reception at the door. The food is excellent and the service is superb. The Screaming O accompanied by hot sake is a fine addition to any entrée.  I'm pleased to find outstanding sushi near Anthem. I'll be visiting them often."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  The sushi is definitely above average, and the pricing is lower almost anywhere. I always order a California roll when I get sushi and the ones here are outstanding. The staff is super nice and accommodating, and the atmosphere is laid back and very clean. There's a lot of sushi places near me but I always go out of my way to come to this one."}
{"text":"Really good food and service. I ordered the lunch wasabi but they gave me the dinner special at the same price of lunch!  Quality sushi and will return again when I'm back in Henderson"}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. The owner used to be the head sushi chef at sushimon on Maryland Pkwy and Silverado Ranch Blvd. Long ago when it was the most popular spot to go to for sushi. The quality and quantity of food for the price is hard to match.  Well worth the experience. Service is very genuine and consistent."}
{"text":"IF I could give this place 6 Stars, I would. 5 Stars for service, 5 Stars for value based on price, quality, and size of portions. 5 Star based on choices and consistency of the food!  Note to patrons who bring in their kids into the restaurant: It is not cool to have your children run around and scream. Yes, I know they are kids. However, this is not cute. Go to Chucky Cheese or don't bring them out!  Then when other patrons give you the stink-eye, you should take the sign of what everyone is thinking in their heads. Yes, I am so mean because I want to eat in peace. And YOU are the rude one for ruining everyone's dining experience!"}
{"text":"It's not all you can eat, but no worries. The prices are more than fare and the sushi is great. Nice and fresh. They have Cajun albacore that will blow your mind.  They also have black rice. I never new such a thing existed. They gave me a little sample and it's not what I expected. Black rice is sweeter than white rice. Not bad but not my first choice when it comes to sushi. I'll stick with the white rice.  Speaking of rice, I have learned that the rice really makes the sushi, as long as the fish is fresh. Their rice is right on target.   Great food at a more than fare price....I'm in!"}
{"text":"GREAT service. All the workers are so friendly and kind. The food was amazing! Great yakisoba, sushi rolls, and their sashimi was FRESH and melted in my mouth. Will be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I rave about it to friends and family and I've spent a date night or two in here for sure. It's always a wonderful experience and I look forward to my return!"}
{"text":"I am a sushi connoisseur and this place is AMAZING! So good, so fresh, and LOVE that they offer black rice. Service was excellent and food came out so quick. Do yourself a favor, and try this place!! My two particular faves were the Rock N Roll and Green Monster."}
{"text":"My new go to for Sushi in Anthem.  Customer service is on point, fast and quick.   Rolls are awesome....try the SOS roll really hot love the spice.  Been here twice and got a teriyaki bowl and that was good as well.  Only negative thing I have to say is that there is no AYCE, but I knew that going in.  Sushi Wa now has a rival."}
{"text":"We were in the area and really craving sushi. Logged into yelp to see the closest sushi spots, this little gem popped up and we gave it a try. It was amazing! My husband and I sat at the sushi bar, chef Harry was funny, great and very quick with service! We got a Hawaiian, golden Philadelphia, hot night and spicy girl.. all were very tasty and filling!   You gotta love when you can do a quick sushi date for less than $30! Even though we don't live in Henderson, we will definitely be back! Next time we are bringing our kids!"}
{"text":"The owners and employees always make us feel welcome here and the food is amazing. Every time we come they treat us like family."}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant I've been to in a long time. Staff is very attentive and nice. Food is excellent and prices are better than any other sushi restaurant in town."}
{"text":"We are regular customers at Hiroba Sushi and have NEVER had a bad item.  Every item is always fresh and beautifully presented.  The service is excellent and they are always eager to accommodate any special request.  The restaurant is clean with traditional decor and a great atmosphere.  I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, superior service. Hand rolls a little weak which is why I gave it 4 stars."}
{"text":"First timer. I want to believe this place will stay the same but like almost every Vegas restaurant it will most likely decline. So take advantage as long as you probably can. Prices are so decent it's unbelievable for me who would pay more for this quality. I believe most if not all of the staff and chefs were actually Japanese. I tried the Mango and salmon black rice roll-excellent for sushi lovers like me that aren't into the fully cooked overwhelming rice and sauce rolls. Clam miso soup is delish and refreshing to finally come across a Japanese restaurant that has it and has real clams in shell. Yellowtail appetizer was decent too. The tempura banana ice cream was really good. I want to come back for some other things soon!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in Vegas. The price is so much cheaper than in Los Angeles.  We came from Los Angeles and was shocked with the sushi price and taste. The spicy tuna roll is the best. Everything is good try their deluxe bento box for 14.99 and you got a full of yummy items teriyaki chicken, teriyaki salmon, spicy tuna, tempura, soup, salad. Worth it to try. Will come back again for sure"}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Food is awesome. I love their vegetable yakisoba and rock n roll veggie roll is also a favorite. Friendly staff.  This is my go to sushi place."}
{"text":"After exceptional reviews we decided to take out lunch for our family of 4.  We ordered 6 rolls and some chicken udon soup.  First, I want to say the prices are exceptional.  $2.99 for a tuna roll is unheard of.  Lunch for 4 people cost less then $25.  Price alone gets 5 stars.  The food, while it was fresh and flavorful, the quality of the fish wasn't grade A+.   For the price it was totally worth the money but I'll probably head across the street next time for higher quality fish."}
{"text":"Trip three, i am Upgrading this to five stars and the food here is so much better than any other sushi I have been to in the area!                                         I have already been back for seconds and it didn't disappoint!  On a side note, l took a roll home and left it for the fridge overnight.  The next day it was still delicious, the true test of great fresh sushi."}
{"text":"This has to be my go-to sushi place. There's no contest. To start, the staff is incredibly hospitable and make sure your needs are tended to as a customer. I've never run low on water because they always filled my glass before it got to that point, which is awesome. So the staff is a huge plus from me.  Onto the food. Really, it's simply amazing. I recently came back from Japan, and as such I'm now a bit snobby about my sushi. They get it 100% right here, and the fish they use is just as fresh as what I had in Japan. It's incredible. They also have a lot of other Japanese items on their menu, including some killer udon soups, some delicious teriyaki bowls, delectable yakisoba, and some of the best fried rice I've ever had.  You probably get it by now but seriously, this place is awesome. I would put down 10 stars if I could. It's that good. I could go on forever about this place but I won't, so you should just go and check it out for yourself.   ????????"}
{"text":"Two words that separate this place from all others. Two words that should make you at least TRY this place. Black rice. Their specialty rolls with black rice are amazing!  The service is top notch, too."}
{"text":"Super nice and friendly staff. Food came quickly.  Very reasonably priced for the quality of the food.  Fresh scallop nigiri was great!  Also beers were very reasonable too.  All in all great place."}
{"text":"We stop here the first time to have our family dinner. Was really a nice comfy place. The foods was amazing. We had complimentary foods by the chefs. We will recommend to our family and friends. Any one that in Las Vegas. You need to try this sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Omg--You have got to try this place! It is a Sushi gem. Everything our family has order has just been delectable. It is my new favorite place.  The staff welcomes you as though you just came home.  The overall experience is A plus.  It's also so affordable.  They have pictures of there sushi rolls which makes it so easy to choose."}
{"text":"This is a solid sushi bar. The fish is fresh and and there is a good selection of special rolls.  Food 4/5 Service 3/5 Decor 2/5"}
{"text":"I wish I took more pics. This is by far one of the best Japanese establishments I have been to. The price is really affordable! The food is made with love, tasty, nice size portion and there is a nice variety.  The owner and all the employees were so kind and friendly, it made me feel like I was in Hawaii! This is a must go to!   Fyi try there tempura cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas, found a excellent Japanese Restaurant. Good food with excellent service. Very nice clean restaurant. Went there for lunch, Ordered the Special Box , but instead of ordering the lunch special Box  for $11.99. We decided to order the dinner for $3.00 more. Instead of 4 pieces for of rolls, dinner will get  8. And can choose instead of 1 entree, you can pick 2 entrees. Better deal, good big portion. We were so full and have leftovers. Highly recommend this place. When headed to vegas again. For sure will go back to this place. Thumbs up, Keep up the good food and service."}
{"text":"Great as usual for an early dinner with the family. Did my favorite roll to start green monster minus the fish eggs to die for. Lemon roll fantastic! Wife did hand rolled salmon skin and bento with beef and salmon and everything was great. This place is not all you can eat but very well priced, great service and great food."}
{"text":"I usually don't drive to Henderson for sushi, but when I do, it's at Hiroba. The menu is EXTENSIVE and there are lots to choose from, even for those in your party that are non-sushi lovers. One of my favorite parts? The black rice. It is sooo good, unique, and worth the price. We got the Geisha (my FAVE), Black Tiger, Golden California, and a couple other black rice rolls (can't remember the name). Everything came out perfect, the fish was fresh, and the presentation is beautiful. The customer service for lunch time was also great and very inviting.   My only complaint would have to be the dessert that we got, the Fruity Sweety. For the price and for what it was, it was not worth it.   If I'm in the mood for sushi, I usually would get AYCE somewhere in Chinatown. At Hiroba, ordering is per entree, so it is a bit pricy but from my experience, it has absolutely been worth it. 100% would recommend if you want good, quality sushi."}
{"text":"I was wondering how this place was getting such great reviews so I took the missus and my oldest son here in a Monday night to try it out!    We got here at 5:00 pm and already the place was getting crowded. That is a great sign. Here we go...  PS I am not a sushi roll aficionado so this is more of a traditional based review.   Location 5 star- easy to get to and plenty of parking.   Interior 5 star - very nice modern and comfortable. You can seat about 11 or 12  at the sushi bar and they have 5 booths,  8 tables to accommodate 4 or 2 people and 2 large tables that can easily seat 8. Great variety of choices.   Service. 3 star. Everyone is so nice, pleasant  and professional. I will go back. When they are more trained I can see myself easily raising this higher. They didn't serve the miso soup and salads properly and the main food came out not nearly on time and with each other. They made all the right corrections when we brought it up. Also, I wanted to order some food to go and they kindly advised they were short staffed and too busy. I am sure they will correct this.    Sushi 4 star- ok my son wanted a dragon roll. \"My eyes rolled\". I really can't understand the enjoyment to eat a roll with so much sauces and conflicting tastes that are all wrapped into one. That being said, I had one piece and thought it was very good for a roll.   Nigiri Sushi 5 star - this was pretty darn good. We had negitoro, maguro, amai ebi, uni. All these were top notch, and I love that there was only small amount of rice.  The fish were flavorful and great texture.   Spicy Seafood Ramen - I think with the great choices of ramen places in town, that this dish would be fairly competitive. The ramen itself was decent, the broth was okay and there was seafood. I just did not feel like OMG, great ramen.  If I choose Ramen again, I am going to Monta Chaya.....  Special Bento Box with 2 Entree - My wife ordered this and I picked on it. She had it with Salmon and with Chicken.  The Salmon was excellent, cooked with the skin and was perfectly cooked, the skin perfect and crispy then when it soaked up the teriyaki sauce, it was deliciously wet with a bit of crispiness left.  Also came with California Roll, Salad, Miso soup and some Tempura and Rice. This is a nice sized dish for sure.  Sushi and Sashimi Dinner - The son had this one and it was good.  Basic sushi and good pieces of Sashimi.  Not too filling, so we did order some nigiri and the roll.  I would have left this a 3 star, however there is so much potential.   GK says check in out."}
{"text":"In all the times I've been here,  I have received nothing but good quality fish at such low prices. Before I was wary, thinking there's no way they can serve fish that cheap and be it any good quality. Everytime, I stand corrected.  The owner (You) is great. Very kind and if she's on the floor, very quick to greet guests and practically fawns over the table to make sure you and your party have everything you need. And if she's not here, then Leyna is here and still provides the same service.  Chef John and Harry, the two sushi chefs that are always present , is always attentive and jokes around with his guests. The moment he sees their eyes wandering and their plate clear (in front of the sushi bar), he asks what more he can make for you. I never noticed that there was no sushi case until someone mentioned it. Never bothered me before. If that's how the restaurant wants to present it, it's their choosing right?  Servers are always great. The moment you walk in , you get greeted right away by \"Irashaimase! (My romanji is bad, sorry). Quick to refill drinks as needed without needing to be asked.   Overall, it's great to come and enjoy a quick meal by yourself or with friends. And oh yes, can't forget about their black rice sushi! It's something different."}
{"text":"Best Ahi Tuna Poke I have found in the area. There is another sushi spot that ties with Hiroba for best off the strip sushi. I cant spew too much but the quality of fish is fantastic and the green tea is very good as well."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I have ever been. Whenever I want sushi, that's the place I go. There variety of choices are amazing. There flavors, spot on. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here 3 times so far and will become a regular! I'm vegetarian and I order a veggie tempura roll with spicy mayo and tempura flakes. So bomb! Pricing is great and service is excellent. My top choice in sushi rolls for vegetarians in the Henderson area. They serve sushi with black rice also, haven't tried it but it sounds interesting and healthy."}
{"text":"My hubby and I decided to give this place a try. This is a newer sushi place in our neighborhood.   We were greeted by a very nice lady when we walked in, and immediately sat. Water for the baby and I, and sake for my husband were brought out quickly.   I ordered 2 rolls, and a cucumber salad. My hubby ordered 2 rolls for himself, and we got a \"kids\" meal for the baby. The kids meal was huge! Way too much for a kid. Chicken, rice, and salad.   My rolls were so good! One of mine was mango, and I cannot remember the name of the other one. My husband really enjoyed his too. He had the Snow White, and something else.   I ended up ordering a dragon roll as my 3rd roll. I didn't like it as much as the first 2.  We will most likely dine here again. The restaurant is very clean, and the staff are very friendly!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for sushi. Inexpensive and great quality food. Ask for the \"fresh\" wasabi. It was the first time I was introduced to it. Yummy. No disappointments here."}
{"text":"We heard good thing about it and were in the mood for sushi. This place was amazing. The screaming O was the best I've ever had. Everything we ordered was incredible, the seafood udon soup was ridiculous. I didn't leave one thing left on the table. Very modestly priced too for a place in a high class neighborhood.  Servers were all obviously experienced and very hospitable.  Food came out fast. A restaurant work of art. Great job whoever put this place together."}
{"text":"This is it folks.  That \"hole in the wall\" GEM of a place that you can't really see from the main road, but man oh man you have got to get in here and eat this food.  (Also, hole in the wall is not meant to be negative, just implying it's not a big chain with marketing power, but a privately owned business...)  *  Welcome Experience -  Absolutely nailed it!  I wish I could bottle this and sell it to other restaurants.    Upon walking in, every visible staff looked in our direction with a warm, hospitable smile and genuine greeting.  I can't tell you how right that feels...  I loved this staff.  Even the sushi chefs from behind the counter in the other side of the room looked over and \"made some noise\" when we walked in.  This place let's you know they're glad you're there.  PERFECT!  *  Establishment -  Outstanding!!  The same care that goes into making us patrons feel welcome obviously went into the decor.  It's a sushi place done right.  It's not tacky or overdone.  It's refined and neat and clean and comfortable and welcoming.  *  Service -  OMG absolutely nailed it.    This place should be a \"case study\" for outstanding service.  This staff was as warm and personable as you can be to us strangers.  We were spoken to with warmth and a genuine concern for our experience.  There was something on the menu I had a question about and then server went out of her way to find the answer immediately.  Our needs were tended to throughout the whole experience, and eye contact was constantly checked in by them to see if we needed anything more.  I felt so welcome there.    Every staff is wearing a clean,  neatly placed name badge.  This is not because a corporate rulebook says they have to, it's because they want you to know their names and they want to be accessible to you.    *  Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation -  Outstanding   The food was extraordinary quality and very well presented.  The wasabi is piped onto the plate to give it a decorative look.  The rolls are well presented and were fresh and delicious.  See photos for more.    The value was extraordinary too!  The prices seem way to low to me!  I'd pay more to ensure an establishment of this caliber service and food stays open!  I intend to visit every time I fly into Vegas on business, even if I have to drive 15 min from the strip.    *  What I'll remember  The incredible warm, hospitable staff and the care that was obvious with regard to service, decor and food prep.  When we left the whole place told us bye and thank you.  I walked in here with no specific expectations, and left absolutely impressed and wanting to applaud this establishment.  BRAVO!  You have MUCH to be proud of!"}
{"text":"We go at least once a week. I like the black rice rolls and the sushi tastes great and fresh."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi spots in Henderson, if not Las Vegas! Amazing service, perfect portion sushi, and the environment is always relaxing. Music isn't too loud and it's a perfect place for birthday parties. My favorite roll are one of their special black rice rolls: must try the Geisha and the Born Super Rich! Super bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Hiroba is another great non-AYCE sushi spot in the Anthem area. They have the total package: amazing food, superb customer service, and great prices.  Honestly, I am not much of a \"roll\" person, but their rolls make me a believer. I normally steer free from rolls with cream cheese and excessive sauces; however, Hiroba does an excellent job of balancing flavors, while maintaining creativity at the same time.   My absolute favorite roll here is the lemon roll. Other sushi places have failed to deliver this simple roll, but Hiroba hands down nails it! Something about that lemon-y ponzu sauce just puts it over the top for me. I love that they top this roll with both hamachi (yellowtail) and salmon.   An interesting, yet intriguing roll is the crunchy tower (5 pieces). It is deep fried spicy salmon, avocado cream cheese fruit mix, crispy shallots, roasted nuts, drizzled with eel and mango sauce.   Seriously, don't knock it until you try it. It's different, but totally works.   The green monster is on the roll menu, but is hardly a roll. The inner core is a mix of chopped soft shell crab, surimi crab, and yum yum scallops. All this is encapsulated by avocado and topped with crispy shallots.   *Side note: the rolls here are flavorful on their own. I barely touched the soy sauce, wasabi, or ginger.  *Honorable mention: snow white roll. Love the subtle smokiness of this roll and overall taste!   They offer a full menu including: udon, yaki soba,  fried rice, donburi, entrees, and bento boxes.   Everyone who works here have been so welcoming and friendly. Attentive service without hovering.  Most importantly, fish was fresh and of great quality!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yu and her wonderful staff for a great dinner. Beautiful restaurant, great menu with so many choices, and the best prices around. See you soon."}
{"text":"First of all... Sue!!! She makes us feel so welcome as well as the whole staff, yet Sue really sets the tone for our dinner. Thank you Sue. Onto the sushi. Delicious! My new fav is S.O.C.  Try it if you love salmon and crab. I also love the monkey brain, made with real monkey brain (maybe its rice and avocado, but it tastes just like the monkey brain grandma used to make.... kidding :).  This place is a jewel. Try it!"}
{"text":"Busy Japanese Restaurant! Can't complain about anything, just love this place around Henderson. My  son is toward Sushi Hiro but the Teri Beef is different and warm glasses for your Beer, not good. Hiroba is my choice!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi.  the volcano with black rice is a satisfying meal for $9"}
{"text":"I love this place . Always awesome. My favorite is is salmon and I don't like salmon cooked.  I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place for their tiger roll and veggie rock n roll. AND sushi made with black rice?! Amazing! Great customer service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great place to eat food its really good i will definitely come back !!!! Great with family great with just solo. So close to my house."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi/nigiri/sashimi and exceptional service!!! My husband and I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Frest ingredients. Friendly employees. Best customer service. Great price for what it is.  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Food, service, and atmosphere...Been to just about every sushi restaurant within 10 miles and none come close (other than sushi Hiro). All the rolls we tried were great, especially the black rice rolls! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"My husband and I love sushi and really appreciate good sushi in Henderson. Hiroba's is always a great experience for the family. Fish is fresh, nice sake selection and great service. I can't forget the to mention the awesome prices!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. Had an amazing all around experience. The staff and service was exceptional along with all of the food we ordered. The sushi was fresh with a lot of different options that I had never seen before. The sushi chef was accommodating to our likes and dislikes and had us sample sauces that we really enjoyed. I highly recommend this sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"My first time coming here and one of the best and freshest sushi I have eaten. Order the salmon and blue fun sashimi, good size and feels like they just caught it right then and there. They may not have all you can eat, but the prices for ala carte make up for it. The presentation of each dish is not what you see at every sushi spot. They offer more than just fish, like chirashi bowls or fried noodles and soups. I will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place... great kept secret!! Me and my family come here often because the food and the service are both outstanding! If you are looking for something healthy, try the black rice rolls. I hate when sushi places don't offer brown rice options,  but the black rice is an even better substitute. I had never seen it before Hiroba's menu, so just that will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm always really hesitant about eating at non-AYCE sushi places but I've heard good things about this place so I decided to stop by on my lunch.   It wasn't that busy so I wasn't worried about having to rush back to work. There were so many options, we had to give it a couple minutes before deciding what we wanted. Our server was sweet, but didn't catch a name. The rolls ranged from $4.99- $11.99; not bad, not bad! We finally decided on what we wanted: Hot Night, Pastel, Golden Spicy Tuna (deep fried), Lemon, & super white tuna nigiri. Our split checks ended up being $15-$20 each and we were both satisfyingly full!   Of the rolls we ordered, Pastel was my favorite: crab stick, cream cheese, avocado, cucumber, wrapped in soy paper, topped with shrimp, eel sauce, and spicy mayo. I really enjoyed the soy paper.   The Lemon roll had a distinct taste to it (I always think \"you can't mess up a lemon salmon roll\"). It wasn't bad, but I think the yuzu lemon sauce just threw me off. I still enjoyed it lol.   When the super white tuna nigiri came out, I wasn't impressed with how it looked (definitely not how I'm used to) but omg, it was delicious! And I love me some super white tuna.   This is probably the only non-AYCE sushi restaurant I will go to!"}
{"text":"Hiroba Sushi is in the same complex once occupied by Sushi Factory taking up about half of the space of the previous business. The non AYCE menu probably has the cheapest prices around which is a major factor that separates it from the other places. The sushi is solid and expect friendly, attentive service.  I've had both lunch and dinner here and I was happy with both meals. For both meals I ordered the sushi combos which come with both miso soup and a salad. The nigiri were standard portions with well cooked and flavored rice. I've had the soft shell crab which the portion may be too small for the price, but I was impressed with crunchy breading and the actual flavor of the crab meat . The octopus carpaccio was definitely too rubbery for my liking. My daughter enjoyed her teriyaki chicken which also comes with miso soup, salad, and rice.  The menu also consists of udon, yaki soba, donburi, cucumber rolls, and fruit rolls. The fruit rolls sound interesting and something I might try on my next visit. For beverage they have beer, wine, and a selection of about 15 different sakes.  There was no wait with both visits, but I would anticipate one during dinner. Service has been consistent including with both meals being offered extra miso soup after I finished and while awaiting entrees. Hiroba isn't my number one option for non AYCE mainly because of convenience of location. But I would definitely not be shy about returning if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I went it for take out and it looked like a great and clean place. Good size sushi rolls and very fresh great cuts of the fish (I've tried other places that the cuts were terrible). Hiroba has Great sushi for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner, friendly staff and a great variety of specialties! Ill be back. Mike Fournier"}
{"text":"Just left the strip to visit family here in Henderson and open up yelp for something healthy. It was nice to find a good and fresh sushi place. They have a big menu. I ordered poke #1 and spider roll. I was too hungry and forgot to take pictures, by the time a I realized  to take photos it was all gone. Staff was very attentive, love to visit here again."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi (and we are very critical), great service and amazing prices! We were visiting from San Diego and found the flavor and freshness of everything to be awesome! We loved the Lemon roll, the spicy lady, the Mexican roll, and salsa dancer. The kids enjoyed California rolls and miso soup. The cucumber salad was also very good! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"After years of eating sushi I can safely say this is amongst the best. The prices are unbeatable and fish is always fresh. Toro for $7... And not small size either. I have eating sushi half my life and didn't think I would find anything at any sushi place that would surprise me. But this place did. They have something called \"black rice\". It is supposed to be healthier for you. Not as chewy as brown rice, and definitely unique."}
{"text":"Ya not sure where some of the other posts came from. Service was very courteous but very slow.  Staff was apologetic and very nice. Atmosphere is poor and it feels like a cafeteria with very poor heating and cooling. All of this would be minor if the sushi was great but that was not the case. Salmon and yellowtail were moderate at best. Fried rice spicy tuna appetizer was sub par. Rolls were okay but generic and doughy. This place may be good if you're looking for a value but there are many other options that are better in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"So unique!!  Super healthy and very different than your average sushi restaurant. They keep things contemporary with their black rice offerings.  Such friendly staff  too!"}
{"text":"Found them through Yelp and had an amazing experience dining at Hiroba!!!  The sushi and staff were amazing!!!  Such a great vibe and amazing food at great prices!!  Haven't had sushi that good in a long time!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for sushi and chicken teriyaki.  My family loves this place, especially the rainbow rolls and teriyaki chicken bowls.  All the people that work here are nice and friendly whether we eat in or get a to go order.  This place is very clean and modern."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place right now by a longshot. There's quite a few restaurants in this area, some are bad, some are good, but this one is the best. The fish is always fresh, the food always comes quick, and the staff is always friendly. The best part? This place costs half of what the other restaurants in the area do. Less money, more food, better quality. They don't drown their rolls in sauces like most places do which is great - you can actually taste the food you're eating. I don't see a reason to go anywhere else on Eastern."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The portions are huge and the fish is fresh.  Their lunch specials are amazing.  We eat here at least twice a week. Looking forward to lunch there again today :) love the sashimi lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"This is a must!! Wonderful & friendly service. Delicious food. Wish I took pictures to share. I had the Screaming O &  the Hot Night. My husband had the chicken yakisoba. It was all delicious!! This is my new spot!"}
{"text":"We were craving sushi and didn't want to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of the strip. Yelped this little gem and we LOVED IT! Had a cute little server who didn't know much about the black rice they were promoting, but it really was tasty. Service was good and price was right."}
{"text":"Ive never yelped before but decided this place deserved my first! I have tried tons of sushi places all over the valley/ OC and this was the best. The service was incredible! Black rice is something i have never tried before and was pleasantly surprised. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! This is our local place and I am so happy that they opened in my neighborhood. I especially appreciate that they are open until 11:00pm. They do not have an AYCE, but their prices are so reasonable. The bento box is amazing (I order it with the Teriyaki Salmon and the Kalbi Ribs) and so is every roll that we have tried. The restaurant is small and very cozy, the staff is very friendly and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"Great local place for sushi! Very new and clean! Decent prices and the quality of the fish was Fresh. Definitely try the green monster, I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place ever! They do not have all you can eat but the prices are so affordable that it doesn't even matter. The sushi is so consistently great each time. They have other great items on the menu besides sushi. They have ramen, donburri rice bowls, lunch and dinner boxes. They also have great deserts as well. The tempura banana split and fruity sweety roll are my favorites. The staff is full of amazing and sweet people. All in all, the food and the service is awesome. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Food looks and tastes great! Lovely staff. Just moved near and will be back again. Loved the black rice sushi."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!!!! Amazing food!!!!!!! It was our first time here but not our last. It's very clean, prices are very very very reasonable, the service is fast. What I enjoyed the most was the service the waiter provided Susanna was very courteous, very attentive, she suggested items, gave me options, it's very hard to find great customer service or people that enjoy what they do and I must say you can tell she does!!!! With that being said if your looking for a new sushi restaurant to go to with great service look no further because this is a place you definitely want to come to."}
{"text":"Great service and great prices! The black rice is delicious and the selection was huge. The servers frequently checked on us and each dish came at good intervals. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, great prices, and friendly environment.   Black rice menu options are very innovative, healthy, and delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hiroba Sushi is THE BEST sushi in Henderson! Their service is impeccable, and chefs are fun to be around. I love the spicy tuna hand rolls wrapped in soy paper. All specialty rolls are the bomb! I'll never go anywhere else for sushi!"}
{"text":"I came here based on the good reviews and I was excited to save money on sushi. After coming here I realized why it's cheaper. You definitely get what you pay for - old, rubbery smelly fish that is hard to digest.  This is the Roberto's Taco Shop of sushi.  Fresh sushi grade fish is not supposed to have an odor.  Or be chewy.  To top it all off, the sushi chef kept sneezing and didn't wash his hands afterwards.  This is why I sit at the bar - to see what's going on. Never again.  I learned my lesson to never trust low priced sushi.  I wonder if all the good reviews on here are real.  Too good to be true and the reviews not posted because they're not recommended all are great reviews."}
{"text":"This is the only sushi place on eastern that I've seen where you can place an order for sashimi that isn't a full sashimi lunch or dinner. And a sashimi order is $5!   Wasn't a fan of the mango sushi roll, but the salmon was awesome!  The restaurant is not as cute as some of the other sushi places in the area, so I don't know if I would recommend this place for a first date. That being said, I was there on a pretty busy night and I thought the service was pretty spot on.   I live right across the street and am so stoked that I have an amazing sushi place within walking distance!"}
{"text":"Best sushi on the west coast. PERIOD. Affordable/huge/delicious rolls with the best service. I won't go anywhere else!  The Red Rock, Black Lemon, and Valley of Fire are my go-to's, and I recommend sitting at the sushi bar so you can speak to the chefs. They are extremely knowledgeable on the sushi and the beers... not to mention they're hilarious. I always feel like family when I go to Hiroba. If I could give it six stars I would!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food at an affordable price. And even more, the service is amazing! I've never been to another place with better service. Hands down. 5 stars is not good enough. Will definitely be coming back and telling everyone I know about this awesome place! Thank you for such an awesome eating experience!"}
{"text":"I have severe shell fish allergy but love sushi.  Hiroba sushi provides special menu for shell fish allergy and gluten free. All of servers are very well trained what I have to ordered and gave good recommendations.  Enjoyed and had good time at Hiroba Sushi."}
{"text":"glad to find good place :)  fresh food, good service  Kalbi beef BBQ, chicken teriyaki is awesome! Sashimi is very fresh also!!  servers very kind too :D"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great sushi for decent prices.   Review of rolls we had this time: Trying to make it through all their baked and fried rolls.   Jumping Lobster (4/5) - baked roll - spicy crab, avocado, cream cheese, lobster, sauce: yum, eel, miso cream. Out of the 3 rolls, this was the best one, and probably the one I would order again out of the 3.   Hawaiian (3/5) - fried roll - salmon, crab, mango, avocado, cream cheese, sauce: eel & sweet chili. It was a decent roll, but I expected more flavor. Mango pieces were really small (but then again, it's not mango season).  Crispy Tower (2/5) - fried roll - spicy salmon, avocado, cream cheese fruit mix, crispy shallots, roasted nuts, sauce: eel & mango. Wayyy too much cream cheese fruit mix piled on top. Could only eat 2 before I had to scrape it off to eat the rest. Definitely would not get this roll again."}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of sushi places here in the Henderson/Las Vegas area and Hiroba Sushi is by far one of the best!.. the fish is very fresh in taste and texture and my favorite the \"Screaming O\" appetizer has the best flavor! The service which is very important to me was excellent and the prices were very good as well! We will definitely be coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  We love going there all the time.  Even our kids love to go for the California roll and shrimp tempura roll. The price is reasonable."}
{"text":"You want to go somewhere worth 5 stars? This place is it right here. Everything from the moment we came in to the moment we left was memorable. From the awesome welcome to the fast and friendly service, this sushi spot won't disappoint. It's quite small but definitely worth a wait. The prices are phenomenal and the fish quality and serving size is even better.   Lemon Roll $7.99 - Crab, Avocado, Cucumber, Salmon, Yellowtail, Lemon slice, Sweet Onion, Ponzu, Yuzu Lemon Sauce -- to die for... my absolute favorite, but I am also a lemon fan.   SOC Roll- Idk what this was exactly, but it was lightly friend and pretty good, but also a heavy roll.  Crunch Shrimp Tempura Roll $4.99 - Shrimp Tempura, Avocado, Cucumber, Crunch, Eel Sauce -- very yummy, your classic but delicious roll!  Mexican Roll $2.99 - Your basic roll -- Spicy crab, Avocado, Cucumber  Sushi Dinner $12.50 - California or Spicy Tuna Roll, Salmon, Yellowtail, Snapper, Shrimp, Eel, Ono Sushi -- comes with miso soup and house salad, AWESOMEEE deal!  I was very satisfied with my experience and I definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"What do you get when you combine incredibly friendly over the top service, super fresh sushi and really low prices? HIROBA.   After the many 5 star reviews I had to try them out for myself. Hiroba is everything the reviews say and more. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and were able to get the last open booth. Our drink orders were taken and since my other half was just getting over a cold we ordered the miso soup (.99 cents). Both arrived very quickly and since we were still perusing the menu of the many rolls we asked for some suggestions.   It turned out we were being served by the owner, Yu. Yu is what every business owner should be. I could not believe how reasonable the prices are here. $2.99 for basic rolls or 2 pieces of nigiri sushi. Most other rolls are $4.99 to about $7.99. We ordered yellow tail sushi, a philly roll, spicy tuna rolls, the lemon roll and a dragon roll. I asked if we could sub salmon for crab in the dragon roll and of course it was no problem at all. Yu noticed that my other half finished his miso quickly and offered us a free refill since he wasn't feeling well.   The rolls started arriving and I was pretty impressed with the size of the sushi. Just enough rice is used and the fish was all very fresh. Yu would always check on us to make sure our glasses were full and replace our napkins. All of the rolls were delicious. As we were finishing Yu came to our table and brought a hot glass of water with honey and lemon saying she was sorry he wasn't feeling well and hoped that this would help. We were both blown away by this gesture. I can't remember the last time we received such hospitable service, even from high end 5 star restaurants.   Although it was our first time to Hiroba we were treated like her family. I told Yu I was going to write her a 5 star Yelp review and she was so thankful. As a business owner she was happy about her 5 star overall rating and acknowledged how Yelp has brought her many new customers. A truly humble and grateful person that has earned my business."}
{"text":"The quality of the fish they use is not of good sushi quality. Service is below average. On the positive note, the place is clean and they have ample parking."}
