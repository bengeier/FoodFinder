{"text":"This place is amazing, love that they servers take care of you and the kanfeh. Sooo good"}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious kunaafa in all of the GTA! What's best about Arabica is that you can control the amount of sugar syrup they put on the kunaafa. I told them to put the bare minimum syrup while making it and just give me a bit of syrup on the side. They did exactly that and it was amazing! Not too sweet- just the way I like it! Highly recommend! :)"}
{"text":"Ok came across this place by fluke driving by.   Had a fresh Kanefe made for me on the spot. If you aren't middle eastern and don't know what that is... it's a delicious Arabic dessert that is also commonly eaten for breakfast!   It was fresh and delicious and I couldn't believe that it was so close to my house!   They serve that and your Arabic coffee and sweets like baklava but I was told they will be carrying more soon. They also have Arabic spinach pies and such also! Although I haven't tried them yet.   The seating area was chill and nice. A great place to have some snacks and sweets with some friends.   Check it out!"}
