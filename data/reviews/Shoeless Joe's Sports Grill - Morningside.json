{"text":"Ohhhh. When did this place upgrade. Shoeless Joe's is a proper spot to chill. You van have a casual get together or come down to get smashed and watch the game.lol this place has excellent service and the food actually got better. I see a change up in the menu. I just got the fried chicken sandwiches which were great! Unfortunately I just came for a few drinks and watch the game, I really would of like to try their menu. All in all. Head to this spot."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I had dinner this evening with our son. Our server was very nice and was able to answer all our questions about the menu. My fiancée and I both work as servers at a busy restaurant.   First we ordered our drinks and I ordered my sons meal from the kids menu. I ordered the cheese flatbread with an apple juice. The server brought our drinks out and brought my sons drink, but brought chocolate milk instead of apple juice. I didn't bother on switching it because my son ended up drinking up the milk anyway.  Just a few minutes later my sons food came out. The flat bread wasn't very good at all, my son didn't even eat, I don't think he could of eaten it. It was really hard and there was barely any cheese on it.   Then our appetizers came, we ordered the fish tacos and the sliders. First off the side plates were very dirty that we had to wipe them with the wet naps they had brought us. The fish tacos were very good, something I would definitely recommend if you plan on getting an appetizer. I asked for a side of ranch sauce for my sliders, later on when I got my bill I noticed they charged me 1.29 for a side of ranch. Like REALLY?? it's a side of ranch.    Our entrees came in next, I ordered the beef stroganoff pasta, it wasn't terrible but it was very salty..I had a few bites of it and wasn't into it anymore. My fiancée ordered the jalapeño burger, we were very disappointed in this dish. We were expecting it to be spicy and but the burger wasn't spicy at all. We then asked our server if the burger had jalepenos in it, she began to explain that the burger isn't spicy at all and that she usually tells her guests that when they order the burger, it's not spicy all. But then she never told us that when we ordered the burger. My fiancée only ate half the burger.   Overall our experience was very disappointing and don't think we will be returning for a second experience."}
{"text":"A group of us went here for a small birthday gathering (5 people in total). It was a Wednesday night dinner around 9pm and the place wasn't really busy and we decided to sit in the dining room. Our server was gracious and wrote down our orders:   - Feta Bruschetta Flatbread - Richard's Red Market Fish and Chips - 2 pieces - The Sophia burger with market fries  - The Lumberjack with baked potato - Michigan Avenue Chicken with veggies and garden salad  I excused myself to the washroom to let the server know that it's a birthday and we'd love to have a small dessert with a candle at the end of the meal - she said it's not a problem at all - score!   Food:  - The Feta Bruschetta Flatbread was the best out of the 5. The portion was great and cut into 8 pieces. Nice and delicious! - Richard's Red Market Fish and Chips; this was massive!! My friend said he could definitely not finish it as it was too much. The taste was a bit oily, but not bad. - The Sophia burger with market fries; My friend who had this said it was underwhelming and the patty was small. It was passable. The fries were just out of the box type.  - The Lumberjack with baked potato; My friend said the patty was also small. The baked potato was alright, nothing spectacular. - Michigan Avenue Chicken with veggies and garden salad; My friend who ordered this got a massive plate with 2 fairly small chicken breasts and nothing else on the plate. She got the garden salad. She inquired with the server about the veggies but the server said it was a choice of the veggies or salad. My friend didn't really think anything of it. The chicken itself was great and the sun-dried tomatoes were so good! The salad.. well nothing special.  At the end of the dinner, we were waiting for the birthday dessert. Another server (not the one we had previously) brought the dessert without a candle or anything. She just said \"Key Lime Pie?\" and I said \"Ohh, um it's for him, birthday boy!\" We looked at each other and couldn't really do anything at this point. Kinda disappointing. Didn't really enjoy that as we were hoping for a nice gesture since it was a birthday. MEH.  Anyway - I went home and checked the menu and this is the description for the Michigan Avenue Chicken: \"Two fire-grilled chicken breasts topped with goat cheese, finished with a fresh basil, sundried tomato and roasted garlic Parmesan cream sauce. Served with fresh vegetables AND your choice of potato, field of greens salad, savoury rice or quinoa\". Well, well, my friend got the two chicken breasts and the field of greens salad, but no fresh veggies.   Thanks Shoeless Joe's. We don't think we'll come back again. The birthday dessert was a bust and you didn't even fill the orders correctly. Avoid."}
{"text":"I was not very happy with the food or service.  as regulars at this location when I'm in the east, I told the server that my risotto was overly salty. the least she could have done was talk to the chef, or manager or at the least, try it herself. she didn't say a word to us regarding it and dismissed it.   I had to walk over to the bar go ask her for water and that too a refill as well.   we also had the meat lovers flatbread, with no beef. we asked for extra cheese on the side, which we had to wait for, for a while even though we told her while ordering. the flatbread was ok.   will I return, no. incredibly disappointed with the service received."}
{"text":"Came here on a week night so it was really empty! This food here is average and the menu is pretty much the basics that you could find at any other restaurant. Got the spinach dip and chicken flatbread to share with my friend. However, we thought the nachos for the spinach dip were a little stale, but it wasn't that much of a deal for us and we still ate it. The chicken flatbread was a good size, and was pretty filling even with sharing. Overall, rating this place a 3 because server was friendly, even though the food was okay."}
{"text":"This is your typical American food franchise.  I've been here twice now for raptors playoff games, and the one thing I really like about this place is that it doesn't get crazy packed for game nights as most other places.  The environment is quiet but they have tons of screens to watch sports.  Booths also have their own screen (although the poor clarity). The food is average.  Both times I've ordered the Berry Pecan salad with chicken.  It has strawberries and blueberries with goat cheese and candied pecans on top of spinach and arugula.  I really enjoyed the salad both times - although it's simple and easy to to make.    My friend got the Shrimp Pesto flatbread, it was average tasting.  my friend thought it lacked toppings n flavour and had a bit too much olive oil.    We also got the mini sliders for an appetizer and it tasted like regular burgers you make on your bbq but a mini version.   The service was great.  I don't have any complaints, but nothing extraordinary. It's just your average American sports bar."}
{"text":"The food is not good but the place is never busy or filled with drunken losers. A typical sports bar, friendly staff and the place is clean. Its attached to a cheap sleazy tour bus hotel so you can't expect much, although it has a decent patio with a view of the 401. Remember to put your license plate number down in the notebook at the front desk or the guard will give you a ticket. I got one once but the bar took care of it."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of shoeless Joe's food and even the service isn't even all that good. I probably see my waitress twice during the whole visit. I should mention the second time I see them, usually is when they just walk by. It's hard to get anyones attention for a refill or additional things for the order.  So why do I keep coming back you ask? My mother comes to town and she is obsessed with shoeless Joe's. She loves the sauced chicken fingers and jasmine rice. Weird combination but she says its really good. So if your a chicken finger lover, I guess give that a try! However, you will not catch me here willingly when there a numerous other sports bars around."}
{"text":"We often go here on Friday afternoons for a late lunch or early dinner. I have always enjoyed my meal and the service is good. Had the calamari last time and it was cooked perfectly ( and I am super fussy). Good place to go for a casual meal."}
{"text":"The food was good, i had a pound of buffalo wings, decent portion and the service was prompt. Although the place can be quite boisterous at times. Beware of the bogans that come around in the summer time"}
{"text":"Service was prompt, The restaurant was clean, pleasant and well-appointed. Not a lot of loud music blaring so it becomes a relaxing dining experience. You must try the Chipotle Chicken salad and the Shrimp and chicken Jambalaya with Quinoa.  Paired together, they were simply heavenly!  Compliments to the Chefs! The servings were quite generous too! Their cocktail desserts are  serious contenders to cakes and pastries. Shoeless Joe's menu boasts of  several, not your typical sports bar kind of  fare: Pasta Carbonara, Seared Tuna as a salad or dish with a choice of pasta, rice or the very healthy Quinoa ( prepared perfectly by Chef), a slew of different types of pizza, gourmet sandwiches and burgers. I was really pleasantly surprised. This is now one of  my favourite restaurants in the GTA . Michelle, our server  who was on her first night of work,was very attentive to our needs. I hope the quality  of food and service never change as we will be coming back here  more often in the future and taking our friends and family. Shoeless Joe in Morningside, you need to seriously advertise around our community. T he only downside for me is that there was nothing else to watch on TV except sports. Our family is not a big sports fan, but we couldn't even get  the news.  If Shoeless Joe, with its menu that's full of variety,  intends to  attract a different kind of crowd too other than your regular sports crowd,  please have more variety on your screens for our viewing pleasure.   I know you will :)"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Waitress was very friendly and recommended the Asian chicken bites for app. We weren't disappointed. Nice and chill environment. Not too crazy for a weekday lunch spot."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and have never had food I did not like. The buffalo chicken flatbread is my all time favourite, and the burgers are great. My boyfriend loves the closer, which is a chicken sandwich with bbq sauce.  The bartenders are friendly, efficient and very knowledgeable about the menu. I've never really had any experience with the waitresses, as I usually come to sit at the bar to watch a sports game. They always have a game on TV and will gladly put on a game if it isn't being shown, or switch games to another TV, etc.  The music playlist is interesting at times, to say the least. It's hit or miss, but it's always entertaining, even if only to laugh at the cheesiness of the throwback playlist.  It's also notable that my boyfriend and I had our first date here, and I know many others who frequent here for dates."}
{"text":"A restaurant that is similar to your typical Jack Astor's or Moxies. The menu is interesting but nothing you couldn't find anywhere else. I had the fish tacos which were good but not great. The staff was friendly and it was my friend's birthday so they brought him a cookie cake which was really yummy. But other than that, it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Never in my life have I walked out of a restaurant before. We were seated by the hostess and were told that our server will be with us in a moment. We ended up waiting for 25 minutes and not even a word from any waitresses, so we decided to just leave. Cannot even properly rate the service because it was nonexistent. Never gonna go back.   Date: January 27th, 7:00pm"}
{"text":"Such a lovely place to watch your favourite sports in Morningside of Scarborough. Alcohol and drinks was well made and served. Desserts are also skillfully made.  Also lovley staff. One stop for Good times!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Shoeless Joes and was expecting something but got nothing instead.  I think Shoeless Joes needs to put them shoes on and learn how to run a real business.  Food was average, long wait times, interior similar to a Kelseys, missing nothing here.  See my pictures added."}
{"text":"Not the best location I've been to. Our waitress was so lost and hardly came up to us, she was so unhelpful. On top of that, our food was not good.   The steak that my boyfriend got was not well done, it was horrible. On top of that, we told the waiter, she came and was being nice about it, however they just used the same steak and tried to \"fix\" it. That was disgusting.   They have this butter chicken dish, which I thought would be good, but I was wrong. The dish was not flavoured at all, the rice was not even well done!   I wouldn't go back here, but if I had to, I'd stick with their desserts. The peanut butter stacker sundae was pretty good."}
{"text":"Late Sunday night looking for a causal dinner with the family decided to stop in here. Dining room side was pretty dead but the bar side is always very lively. A large bar along one side with bar stools for solo diners and booths around the opposite side with several flat screen tv's with various games playing all over the walls.   The hostess greets us and told us to pick a booth and she will be over to drop off the menus. We climbed into a comfy booth with a small flat screen tv on the wall of booth with the game playing is a nice touch. Our waiter Jason comes, very friendly and funny too cracks some jokes with us and takes our drinks orders.  We peruse the menus, great selection of food, burgers, wings, pizza, sandwiches, pasta, steaks everything looks good.  For app we decide to share one of Joe's Oven Baked Flatbread  Joe Buffalo Chicken Flatbread - Breaded chicken chopped and tossed with Joe's Buffalo Butter sauce with smoked bacon, fresh tomatoes, cheddar & mozzarella, green onions and buttermilk ranch dressing. Hefty portion 8 pieces but great for sharing. Super yummy, we all loved it, good crust, ample and flavourful toppings, a great start to the meal!  Mains Included  Stacked Montreal Smoked Meat - Montreal smoked meat, Swiss cheese, Dijon mustard on marble rye w/ side onion rings.  Applewood bacon and Cheddar burger w/onion rings  Championdhip wing dinner - A full pound of wings prepared the way you want them, tossed in your choice of sauce and side.  My sandwich was totally stacked on fresh rye bread, juicy smokey meat draped with melted swiss. I enjoyed it! And the onion rings were thick cut crispy golden brown, perfection!  Burger was juicy on a soft brioche bun, good toppings.  Wings - Hot and Honey - good balance of heat and sweet w/onion rings  Wings - Sea salt and cracked pepper - perfectly seasoned, nice crunch and good coating w/ thick cut golden french fries  FYI The wings here are huge, good size, cooked perfectly, get them dusted for that perfect golden coating.  Finally to round out a great meal we had to finish with the perfect dessert. After reflecting over a good lineup of desserts we all decide on the same thing.  Chocolate Praline Almond Torte - Loaded with chocolate, carmel, candied almonds on an oreo cookie crust with a side of whipped topping.  I hate carmel but it looked so good I had to get it. It barely had any carmel so I thoroughly enjoyed it! It tasted more like a chocolate cheesecake mousse. Really delicious and creamy with a good crunch with the candied almonds and oreo crust. A perfect finish to a great meal.  Overall a great selection of food, everyone thoroughly enjoyed there meal from start to finish, our wonderful server Jason made our dining experience more enjoyable. A great place to watch the game as they have ample tv's theres no way you could miss a play!"}
