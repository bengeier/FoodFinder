{"text":"I would say this place offers more savoury and specialty bubble waffles than the original plain bubble waffle. I've read a number of reviews about the long wait times for the waffles when they first opened. I was hoping they would be faster now that they've been opened over a month, but unfortunately not.  There was a huge crowd of people when we arrived but no lineup. We were debating about what to get for around 5-10 minutes and the cashier was super helpful and friendly. We ended up ordering a white chocolate strawberry waffle with black sesame and coconut ice cream and fresh strawberries on the side and a pork floss and seaweed waffle with coconut ice cream and fresh strawberries and red bean on the side (we didnt want the waffle to get soggy).  While waiting they gave us our ice cream first. The coconut ice cream was good - very creamy and had shredded coconut bits inside. The flavour of the black sesame ice cream wasn't strong enough. The fresh fruit was pretty sweet.   We waited around 20 mins for both waffles to be made. They have four bubble waffle machines and it wasn't busy so we were confused why the wait was so long. The employees treat the bubble waffles with a lot of care, making sure each bubble had toppings. They made sure the waffles were perfect, ripping off all the uneven crispy edges (which I actually really like :/).  The waffles were hot and crispy. The white chocolate strawberry one was a nice combo. The strawberry was like the taste of strawberry ice cream. Inside each bubble was white chocolate chips. Not sure if they were supposed to be completely melted but they were still in chocolate chip form when eaten. The pork floss seaweed one was great. One side was more seaweed while the other was more pork floss. It kinda reminded me of the pork floss egg rolls. There was no egg taste in either, probably because the flavours were so strong the egg taste was completed covered.   Overall 3.5/5 which rounds up to 4 due to their excellent service!"}
{"text":"It's expensive 11-12$ for waffles and ice cream with 1 topping. Banana topping is 3$....... you can buy a whole rack of bananas for 3$ My friend got strawberry white chocolate waffle and guess what THERE WAS NO WHITE CHOCOLATE.  Overall, is it worth your money? No. Just get a bubble waffle at pmall and buy yourself a whole rack of bananas.  Tasted aight tho"}
{"text":"Came here during soft opening to try their unique egg waffles. They were giving away one free waffles per individual from their selected menu during 1-3pm on April 7th & 8th. You have many flavours to choose from and as well as the ability to customize. Cheesecakes from Cheesecake Factory is also available here.   I lined up and got to try the pork floss with seaweed ($6) and lava cheddar cheese ($7) flavour egg bubbles. Opted out on ice cream and toppings so I can experience the flavours of the egg waffles much better. To be honest, the texture was too soft and mushy; wished it was more crisped. The natural egg flavour wasn't really present but I did enjoy the lava cheddar cheese flavour much more than the pork floss as it was more rich. I think it is overpriced for just egg waffles and for what it is so I am glad that I didn't have to pay for it.   Moreover, service was good and friendly. You can definitely tell that they put effort into handcrafting every detail of the waffle carefully. Presentation looks yummy but don't be deceive. I'd say try it for yourself but this one time is enough for me."}
{"text":"This is probably the best egg waffle I have had in years. Very creative combinations, lots of selections, you will never be bored. The egg waffle is crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside and finally an egg waffle that taste like real egg.  Avg wait time for the waffle is about 5 mins, freshly made, hot and delicious. With the freezing cold ice cream in top. I just love that combination  The staff was very friendly, the place is clean, plenty of parking outside, for $6 it's a great deal. Any dessert house outside easily cost over  $10 for a waffle or any dessert.   I highly recommend and would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Such great service and quality desserts! I had the black sesame waffle with coconut & black sesame ice cream. Topped with Oreos, sprinkles & smarties. 100% recommend the black sesame waffle & ice cream! So good! The waffles are cooked perfectly and aren't overly sweet. Compliment ice cream really well.   I also had the chance to try their Mac and Cheese waffle which isn't avail in store but will be featured during Toronto's Mac and cheese event. Personally I think it could have been better with less bacon and if the cheese was melted/torched more, but regardless the green onion topping and green onion waffle are excellent. The Mac and cheese itself was also delicious and creamy ! The sweetness of the waffle compliments the saltiness of the cheese and bacon."}
{"text":"I came around 9pm (after dinner). There was no lineup. Order made fresh on the spot (takes time and not suitable for on the go people). Staffs were helpful with choosing the products. Shop decor is beautiful and modern like a new hive (bubbles)  I ordered taro mochi ($7) and milk tea waffle ($5) with no ice cream.   Batter was not sweet to a point it was blend and tasteless. I don't taste the strong flavor of eggs and butter either. There's a weird after rough feeling on my tongue and kinna numb too. (Rough feeling like the after feeling of eating a lot of spinach)  Milk tea waffle tasted like any original egg waffle, no milk tea taste. (Maybe a hint of bitterness from \"tea\" at the first two bites)  Taro mochi: the gimmick of mochi was interesting and thoughtful. However the batter has no taro flavor, not sweet and tasteless.   They have a dyson fan blowing the waffles yet my waffle was still soggy and soft. The batter obviously was dense and doughy. Nevermind tasteless.  The paper bag they use was waxed on the inside. Poor design, capturing the heat moisture inside the bag and my waffle obviously absorbs back the moisture and was soggy.   Waffle cooled down really quick. Not exactly my go to spot. Was disappointed."}
{"text":"If you enjoy egg waffles with crispy outside but chewy bite inside like me, then you'll enjoy the mochi egg waffle at Golden Bubbles though price is a bit steep at $7. They put a piece of mochi in each bubble. I also enjoy the taro flavour which not a lot of places have.  The Lemon Cano ($4.49) is pretty interesting in a good way! It's a mix of lemonade and espresso.   Note though: Expect to wait even if there's no line. They just recently opened BUT staff training is really needed. We waited for 20 minutes for one egg waffle to be done, and this is because the staff had to make ours three times. And the staff who did our lemon cano is unsure of what the drink looks like so, instead, he drank the drink first to make sure what he did was correct before doing ours. ?"}
{"text":"A lot of hype around this place since it opened because of it being all over social media. Decided to try this place out since I love hong kong egg waffles. They have 2 limited time flavours, taro mochi and matcha mochi. I decided to try the taro mochi ($7.9 after tax) since i love taro but the one I got didn't have a lot of taro flavour. So subtle it was almost non-existent. It tasted just like a regular egg waffle with mochi in each bubble. It stands out from the egg waffles from other places because of the different flavours but I think they can improve on their taro one. The egg waffle is not bad but for such an expensive price I was expecting more. Going to try out the other flavours and see how they compare."}
{"text":"I want to stop by here and see what all the hype was about and was fairly pleased with my visit.  I came here on a weekday and on a weekend about 6-7 pm and there was barely a line up which was a plus.  They have some already pre set waffles, but if you want to create your own you can do so as you please lots of option to make your own customize waffles   I gotten the mochi taro waffle which is a limited time offer item not sure when they are lasting until but will totally recommend on getting it!  There was mochi in every bite and the waffles were so soft loved it! The matcha ice cream tasted pretty good as well!  It's kinda expensive but it's so worth. No seating"}
{"text":"This was a unique egg waffle cone ice cream spot. They have different flavours of egg waffles which sounds and tastes amazing! I got the strawberry white chocolate chip waffle, and it was delicious. You can customize your own waffle cone with which flavours, ice cream and toppings like I did, but it is a bit more on the pricey side if you. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent chocolate bubble waffle ($6.50), equal distribution of toppings, there wasn't that many people in line but it took quite a while to make the waffle. Nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I wouldn't waste $ on the ice cream and fruits though. A little pricey, Eggette Hut in Markham is $4.43 for the same exact size and quality."}
{"text":"I Came on a Thursday evening and the shop was pretty empty. Less than a handful of customers in the shop but 8 staffs over the counter. It was a bit intimidating at first since they were all just waiting for me to place an order. But I could imagine there being a nice assembly system once the shop gets busy in peak hours.  I got a bit indecisive after checking out their menu. They offer prefixed items (some with ice creams, some without) and customized option in which you can build your own by adding toppings for a cost. It took me a bit of time to decide which option to go for but I ended up building my own with a cappuccino waffle base with a scoop of sesame seed ice cream drizzled with chocolate Syrup and sprinkled with icing sugar. Price came to about $8. I originally wanted to try their milk tea waffle but it was unavailable at the time. I was surprised to find their cappuccino waffle to actually taste like coffee. The base was crispy and aromatic with strong coffee flavour in every bite. The sesame ice cream is decent, not really packed with intense sesame flavour but the flavour was there. I'd actually prefer the ice cream to be more flavorful but in my case since the cappuccino waffle was so strong already, the ice cream created a good balance.  Overall, I think I had a great experience and I'd come back to try other flavors when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This plaza has so many dessert and bbt options now!! I've been meaning to come and try this place but every time I'm here there's always been a long line. Last night we got there around 8:30 and lucked out. No line!!! 5 minutes later a bunch of people showed up and line was to the door!! Other reviews are correct in that the wait for your order can take a while. I'm not sure why they don't pre-make waffles and assemble but I guess this ensures freshness. Great care is taken to assembling the dessert which I appreciated.  Their menu consists of different types of bubble waffles (honey, matcha, cheese, etc) or you can get bubble waffle with ice cream or fruit. I say \"or\" because I ordered the berrylicious waffle only to be asked if I wanted to add ice cream to it. When you look at the picture on the menu it does look like there's ice cream with it but it's actually whipped cream. It is a bit misleading. I think all the fruit options do not include ice cream.  The berry waffle I ordered was their mini size which is actually a decent size. It's half a bubble waffle with whipped cream and berries. More than enough for an after meal dessert. It was pretty tasty and the workers that served me were really nice. Prices are a bit steep but I would come back again so long as there is a minimal line."}
{"text":"Cute new bubble waffle ice cream place in the middle of a bunch of other yummy eateries. The place itself is small, maybe only 2-3 seating places. And if there's a long line, it really crowds the area. The service is great, everyone is super helpful.   The flavours are very unique, I don't think I've seen anything similar at a bubble waffle place. I got the oreo specialty and the banana split. All were so yummy and perfect on a hot day. There's a couple of different sizes to play around with which I thought was super helpful. The egg waffles were well made, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, just as I like it.   The price is pretty standard with competing bubble waffle places I thought."}
{"text":"It was quite the trek for us but worth it!  It was pretty busy on a Wednesday night.  There was a line up of about 10 people.  The staff was nice but seemed a bit disorganized.  They skipped one of our orders.  There are only 3 waffle makers - I think they could use more.  We tried the signature waffles (Berry and the cappuccino banana). So good!  We polished them off in a few minutes!  Now I want to make my own!"}
{"text":"I've ordered the taro mochi bubble waffle. Texture is great and chewy, but I find it a little too sweet. I was hoping I can order half order, but only the ones with ice cream comes in half order. I was hoping to try milk tea and taro mochi. It's not bad but no wow factor."}
{"text":"I think it's over hyped. They say it's traditional Hong-Kong style egg waffle....but if you've ever had authentic egg waffles in Hong Kong, you would know that it doesn't taste like any of the ones in Canada.   But I think their egg waffles are overpriced for what it is. We got the Matcha Red Bean waffle with the ice cream and everything and it was just \"okay\". Nothing really special about it. The waffle itself got soggy pretty fast, and it was light in flavour. The ice cream just tasted like ice cream you could get at AYCE.   So overall I think it's not really worth it."}
{"text":"So I came here on Thursday night and liked it so came back yesterday to bring my mom. I'm going to start by saying this rating is more so because of the experience received at this place yesterday. I think I happened to come in where they were catering to social media influencers throughout the day. So here are my thoughts on this place.  I would of preferred if they put a sign up and opened it solely for the media influencers at a specific time. Why ? As a paying customer I received a less than positive experience as soon as I entered the establishment. I came in and first thing said to me was \"Are you on the list\" and immediately felt segregated and less important in there as the answer to the question was 'no'. The person working there that asked walked me right to the front and told the cashier that I wasn't on the list. The feeling after that was just sadness that I wasn't on the list and wonder of how I could get on it. ALSO I brought my mom here because I came the night before and was passing by so I thought I'd let her try it. And with no surprise, my mom was wondering what this 'list' was all about too by the time we walked out.  Alright as for the waffle itself I ordered the taro mochi and the matcha mochi flavours 7$ each. I would say the waffle isn't bad and that's why this place is getting a 2 not a 1 star. Generally the first day I came here would of probably rated it higher but with all the awkwardness it just dropped for me. And note- depending on how many people there are in there I think you could get a slightly soggy waffle. Overall worth it to at least try. Would I go back for the waffle? Yeah might even try something from their drink menu. The question is, would I actually come back based on the experience? Unsure."}
{"text":"We came here for the egg waffle with mochi inside. When I received the egg waffle, the mochi is served separately on the side!!! I asked and they said they \"special\" was over! How disappointing! And it doesn't taste good at all, there is no flavour to it! A friendly comment to the cashier: if a customer ordered a waffle with mochi BUT your special is over, won't you feel obligated to question how awkward it is???"}
{"text":"Not too impressive,we went there when there were soft opening,we lined up for almost one hour, ordered some of the specialty egg waffles,Pork Floss Seaweed one is the best, the others just tasted normal."}
{"text":"Golden bubbles is near the back of the plaza, there's lots of parking which is a bonus. the inside is nice and clean (no sitting area tho) you can't really enjoy your ice cream inside (take it to go)   I tried the mini me size which i really appreciate! cause i can't finish a full size alone. had the matcha waffles with matcha ice cream and res beans. the matcha ice cream was so strong in flavour and not sweet, the waffle was delicious they perfected the batter, because it was crispy on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside. would try other flavours again.   I saw some pics of a mochi type waffle? must have been a promo cause it's not on the regular menu (bring it back)"}
{"text":"Ordered a cappuccino egg waffle with cappuccino ice cream but there was no cappuccino flavour. We waited about 20 mins for them to make the egg waffle, with only one other order in front of us. I imagine the wait during the evenings would be wayy longer. I guess that's what you get for made to order egg waffles."}
{"text":"I wanted to see what the hype was all about, didn't expect to love it so much! I would say it's a little pricey but such is life. I ordered waffle mix and match wifey original waffle, vanilla icecream and bananas with Nutella topping! The warm waffle with the icecream and bananas,to die for.   They also have cheese cake factory cheese cake guys!!!!!!"}
{"text":"When you think of HK Egg waffle, you think light, airy, delicious. Outer crispness, with some a nice moist interior. Golden bubbles is exemplifies everything that it is not. Overcooked, burnt to crisp egg waffle, filled with nothing more than mediocre ice cream bought from the closest whole sale.   Although Ice cream waffles are attractive, for $12 for something below mediocre should be considered stealing. There are many better options in the city.  If you're looking for good HK egg waffles, I recommend Eggette Hut. For HK Waffles with better Handmade Ice Cream, Bang Bang Ice cream."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place.   My BF made his own: black and white sesame seed HK waffle with one scoop of black sesame seed ice cream and blueberries. And I got the Signature Matcha Red bean: Matcha poppy seed HK waffle with two scoops of green tea ice cream, wafer stick and whipped cream.   Let me tell you... these people... CARE about your order. These generous people actually take the time to make sure that each bubble has the stuffing inside. Whether it be black and white sesame seeds, poppy seeds or even cheese squares, strawberries and white chocolate chips I saw on other orders. The man decorating our order... GENEROUS. He piled red beans on my order, hand placed each blueberry on my Bfs order, and made the whipped cream look presentable. The HK waffle was just the way I love it. Soft and chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside also tasty. The ice cream is the usual taste but nonetheless still good.   Not only are the people generous they are so welcoming and friendly.   I had a miscommunication with the cashier. I thought I ordered the signature matcha red bean but they made me just the plan HK matcha red bean waffle. So when I got my order I was confused. So when I went to clarify, these lovely people refunded me money and charged me for the right one. They were so patient and apologetic, like it was my fault, but they kept saying sorry. So nice. I also got a free item card. Hello! So kind! Honestly great customer service and I'm not saying that coz I got that card.   I was disappointed when they sold out of the Milk tea HK waffle and the mochi filled HK waffle. Like those were the two Reasons why I wanted to try this place out. But oh well I still got a bomb ass hell good dessert. I'm just gonna have to come back!!! What is a diet anyways?   They need to make a location downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"Golden Bubbles is a bubble waffle lover's heaven that has opened up in the plaza north of Finch and Midland. Golden Bubbles is a chain which first saw success in Ottawa, but which has now expanded to Scarborough and soon to Richmond Hill. This particular location has no seating whatsoever so takeout is your only option. In addition to the variety of waffle options, they also sell beverages such as specialty coffee and Sloane teas. Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes and slices are also available for sale.  When you step inside the shop, the intoxicating aroma of fresh sweet waffle batter hits you and lulls you into waffle purchasing submission. They have well over a dozen flavours of waffles to choose from that are also available in mini (half) sizes. Waffles are made to order so it takes a few minutes to receive your order but they are served hot and fresh. We ordered the original flavour, the taro mochi waffle and the matcha mochi waffle. The waffles are lightly sweet and have a satisfying crunchy exterior. I really enjoyed the hot matcha mochi waffle which had the slight bitterness of matcha contrasted by the soft chewy mochi. The taro mochi waffle was also yummy but our particular waffle was a bit soft so lacked the contrast of texture present in the other two waffles.   Different from competitor Woofles and Cream that serves soft serve, Golden Bubbles serves equally Instagrammable, artfully crafted bubble waffle cones with fruit and scoops of ice cream that are available in flavours such as taro, matcha, mango, and black sesame. As we came on a cold spring evening, we opted for the waffles without ice cream.  I will definitely be back to try their milk tea waffle, their cheese waffle, and some of their ice cream waffles."}
{"text":"I tried to go for the free promo but unfortunately I was just a couple ppl away from getting it.   I ordered the matcha signature and it was much Better than what I first got. I was very pleased to see they put more than 1 mochi in each eggette bubble. I saw 2-4 mochi placed this time. I really like how they have a production line, 1 person handling the batter, 1 for refilling the topping, 2 ppl handling the eggette waffle, 1 person handling the detail and the shape of the waffles, 1 person scooping  ice cream & last and final 1 for the toppings. They are well organized.   When I was waiting in line to get my waffle, a customer dropped their waffle and one the the employees immediately handled the situation by giving them a complimentary replacement.  So now for the actual waffle tasting and review. The looks for waffle was just like the picture, so that's a good thing! Now for flavour. I love the ice cream, it wasn't very sweet it had a nice matcha flavour. I wished they had more red bean paste it wasn't enough when there are two scoops of ice cream. The waffle stick was just 1/2 or 1/3? I somewhat feel it's be better if it's a full one. Although there was a huge improvement on the eggette waffle I still wished the waffle had a crispness from beginning to end. I quite enjoyed how each eggette bubble had poppy seeds.   Hopefully they can make it better the next time I visit"}
{"text":"Finally came here to try their delicious waffles that everyone seems to want to try right now. When it first opened, the hype seems to be carrying this place for now. Nice interior look inside the place but it did seem to be very crammed inside with no seating. Luckily, it wasn't too busy when we arrived. Even on a weekday evening, it draws quite a decent crowd.  They offer different sizes of the waffles- Full Cone and the Mini-Me. I ordered the Full Cone of the \"Oh Canada' which is quite a Canadian treat with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream, strawberries, whip cream and a maple leaf chocolate piece. I thought the waffles were good and nicely presentable- definitely an Instagram worthy dessert. For the price and how much you get, it's decent. My preference would be the waffle to be more warm/hot. Due to the lack of seating and cause the weather was nice enough, we went outside to enjoy our waffle. A cool thing here is that they actually sell slices and whole cakes from the cheesecake factory- didn't expect that but a nice treat to get if you love their cheesecakes! Overall, a decent place to grab a dessert on the go if you are in the area! I wouldn't mind coming back to try their own waffle creations!!!"}
{"text":"This place is all the rage right now but I think my expectations were set higher as a result, and that led to a somewhat less than stellar experience here.   We came on a weekday night and it wasn't too busy here, what I mean by that is that you didn't have to wait outside, unlike the one time I drove by on a weekend.  There's a lot of options here, you can build your own creation or go with their signatures. We just went with a mini sized (it comes in a cup) matcha red bean waffle. It's a good sized and it was clean to eat in the cup which I'd prefer over the regular size. The waffle was nice and crispy; it was supposed to be matcha and poppy seed but those flavors didn't come through all that intensely. The waffle was finished off with matcha icecream, red bean, a chocolate wafer, and some whipped cream. The ice cream was good and everything was fresh tasting which was a positive but nothing amazed us.     It's important to note there's absolutely no seating here beside a small bench by the windows but with the amount of people here, it's not the most pleasant or comfortable. We took our cup back to the car and ate it there. This is a dessert I'd like to have maybe walking around a bit and enjoying it. The location here makes it really difficult for that.   Combined with the fact that the waffle was good, not great and was a bit pricey I'm not quite sure how I feel about Golden Bubbles. I might come back to try their others but I'm definitely not in a rush to do so."}
{"text":"So overpriced - It was $8 plus tax for just the waffle. I got the matcha and redbean waffle. The taste was okay (lots of matcha flavour and redbean inside) but the batter is a bit too thick. It was also a little bit overdone."}
{"text":"I've seen Golden Bubbles at other establishments (T&T and Night it Up! night markets) so it's nice to see them open a permanent location in the GTA!   It's a polished no-seat yellow and white-themed takeout shop, but spacious enough to lounge around when waiting. They made my desserts to order; takes about 5 min.  I think there are some hit or miss flavours, so your experience can go either way. What I've tried so far:  Hits: Icecream - taro, black sesame (Both are extremely flavourful) The Cheesecake Factory Cheesecakes (Worth it. Tried the original and it was delicious. It's a bonus that you don't even have to line up an hour at yorkdale) Lava Cheddar Cheese Waffle  (moist interior. Very buttery. A classic sharp cheddar taste. It's exactly how you expect it to taste so make sure to eat it fresh)  Worth trying at least once: Taro Mochi Waffle (Each \"bubble quadrant\" has a piece of mochi inside. It's the first time I've tried something so unique. The taro flavour in the waffle is subtle (probably to counter the icecream sweetness), but the mochi pieces are fun to eat. Nice and gooey texture.)  Misses: Matcha Redbean Waffle (The matcha tastes minty)  What I appreciate the most about the egg waffles is that they're not dry on the inside. They definitely have the texture down. They're soft, fluffy, and slightly crispy for some of the pieces. I wanna go back to try the pork floss and seaweed waffle, other icecream flavours, and the other flavoured cheesecakes!"}
{"text":"For the past two years, I've been trekking to Markham to grab bubble waffles with ice cream. I have yet to encounter a place in Scarborough that tops Wooffles & Cream, and Golden Bubbles definitely does not come close.   Many reviews have said the wait was not worth it, so the GF and I came here at 11pm and only had to wait 10 minutes. I was interested in the fruit/berry-based flavours, but they came with whipped cream instead of ice cream, which was super disappointing. We ordered the Chocolate Banana Cappuccino and Matcha Red Bean in the mini size for $6 each. The mini size uses half the regular waffle size, which was perfect for a smaller snack.  Flavourwise, it was just average. The waffle itself has that crispy but soft texture you'd expect, but it didn't have much flavour on its own. The matcha ice cream was average as well. The biggest flavour was from the red bean; without it, I think this would get a 2/5.   Overall, I think this place gets an average 3/5. The only reason I'd come here over Wooffles is that Golden Bubbles offers a mini size."}
{"text":"I ordered the matcha poppyseed waffle with the taro icecream and everything is one flavour - bland. The taro icecream had no taro flavour and the waffle tasted like crispy cardboard at first and then became a soggy cardboard.   I was close to even tossing the entire thing out except I paid $8.50 for it and did not have dinner.   I was looking forward to trying this place out but was sadly very disappointed and won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"Small little cute place. Good selection. Prices are pretty expensive but still everything was pretty much good. Only one problem. I've never seen someone assemble a waffle so slow. Tall Asian guy literally took 25 minutes to make two signature waffles. Compare it to the scene in zootopia with the sloths. He called out my number but we were the only people in the place and didn't want to give it to us without the receipt"}
{"text":"If you're coming here because the cute instagram photos are screaming at you to check this place out, let me be the first to tell you not to waste your money on a dessert that tasted so disgusting that I ended up throwing half of it out--and this is coming from someone who doesn't like to waste food.  I know some people, when they eat an ice cream on a cone, their favourite part is literally, the cone. What makes a super awesome cone? The amount of sweetness a cone has in contrast to the ice cream. At Golden Bubble, when you order their signature bubble waffle, the bubble waffle acts as the \"cone\" to the filling that it is holding. As whip cream, especially ice cream, is significantly sweeter than the average dessert, it is important for the \"cone\" to be sweet enough to balance its fillings.  Sadly, the bubble waffle failed to meet that expectation. I ordered the Matcha redbean and was extremely excited to try the matcha bubble waffle but after one bite, I almost wanted to spit it out. It did not have the matcha sweetness but tasted bitter and had an awful, super awful after-taste. Literally, I just ate the matcha ice cream and red bean and then threw out the bubble waffle. What I can't believe is that one bubble waffle costs $6. Please don't waste your money buying something that does not taste delicious.   I was also distraught to see the workers when there's a half order, cutting bubble waffles in half and throwing the rest away. What a waste!! This is probably why the cost of Golden Bubbles is so expensive--to account for what they are wasting.  Despite how displeased I was with the product, I am still giving this place 2 stars. The reason is purely because of the service. The amount of care that is placed on each bubble waffle whether in the making, cooling, or decorating, I just loved the attention it was given. Unfortunately, there needs to be some fine-tuning in the bubble waffle recipe.   I want to wish Golden Bubble all the best and maybe... maybe I'll come back in the future once you've figured out how to make your product taste better."}
{"text":"The taro ice cream is out of this world.  So yes I'm very biased in saying this is the best egg-waffle place I've ever tried. For the taro ice-cream alone  (I ordered with the sesame waffle), it's 5/5. They use fresh fruits and don't skimp on the toppings or presentation. Total came to around $8.  It's definitely a higher scale establishments than most egg waffle vendors (like Pacific Mall or Chinatown). Thus the price reflects it. The specialized waffles alone cost $6 and signature waffles will easily be $10+ which is pretty costly for one dessert-to-go. There are no tables or really any service. The decor, music, and young customer-base will all explain the higher price. It's very much a place for the aesthetics, customization, and popular hits like matcha+red bean.  Come here if you love hype and insta-worthy desserts. Skip if you don't care much for aesthetics or hate small, crowded spaces."}
{"text":"First of all, I was very impressed with the friendly staff! they greeted us with a big smile as soon as we walked in and had a very fun/bubbly atmosphere. I have a craving for egg waffles every now and then and when I saw that this store was opening soon, I couldn't wait to try them.   I ordered the matcha mochi waffle with a black sesame ice cream and it was absolutely delicious! I find the price reasonable as the waffle was super yummy. Definitely coming again to try the other waffles!"}
{"text":"If you love mochi & egg waffles, this us the place to be! Absolutely delicious combo and the staff are very friendly. The place is modern, clean, and tasteful. They even feature Cheesecake Factory cakes! Great place for any dessert lover to visit."}
{"text":"April 20, 2018 -  This location opened on Apr 7, 2018. My cousin and I went there at 11pm (I was shocked to know that they open until 2am)... The staff there was so friendly we talked about Hong Kong milk tea and other stuff. The cashier was very helpful. My cousin ordered the Oreo waffle for $6.50 and I ordered the Milk tea waffle for $5.00.  My cousin felt it was over was a hit over priced and that the batter could excellent but the Oreo didn't work well. She was hoping for a more \"Oreo n' cream\" kinda thing and she get the hard Oreo and soft waffle didn't work that well....... I actually liked it. I like the Oreo crunch.  My Milk tea waffle was good, I definitely tasted the milk tea!!   I kinda feel the same about the pricing for just a waffle without any toppings (too pricey).   Note: I WILL GO BACK but I will get it with ice cream because I really liked the flavour of the waffles.   *************Important News**************** The limited addition Matcha Mochi & Taro Mochi are all SOLD OUT and it may not come back until June"}
{"text":"If I could give this place ZERO stars I totally would! First off, the wait was over 30 minutes for one original waffle. And second, worst mushy egg waffle ever! I don't understand why this store has 6-7 people \"working\" when only one person tends to the cashier, one person cooks the waffles and another person adds toppings. By the way, the thing that pissed me off the most was the fact that service could've been faster but all the employees were too busy chatting it up with each other!   I ordered one original waffle. The one guy behind the waffle makers started cutting up my waffle when it was done. Because he was too busy talking and not paying attention to offers he thought my waffle was going to be filled with toppings or something. I didn't care about this but before I could say anything the girl at the register yelled she would like to take the scraps and he ends up giving the WHOLE waffle to her in her hands. A different employee was trying to explain to me what happened and I told him I wouldn't have cared if the waffle was cut. I would've still taken it the way it was. Anyways since he already gave my original order away I had to wait longer for another one to be made.   As for the taste, this was not crispy at all on the outside. It deflated less than 5 minutes later just as another yelped mentioned. I had parts to my waffle that wasnt even cooked all the way through.   This was the worst tasting egg waffle I've ever had and on top of that the service made it the worst experience! You would think a newly opened store would have trained their employees better but instead people get paid to stand around to talk with one another and not do their damn jobs.   If you want to wait in long lines for mushy egg waffles this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Tried there original and cappuccino flavor waffles. They seem to be always out of the milk tea flavour which I want to try. Maybe you have to go early. The original is good I didn't like the cappuccino one. You can get just the waffles or one with ice cream and fruits. I will go back and try the fancy looking ones with ice cream and fruits."}
{"text":"The concept for this new dessert place is simple: egg waffle creations that are sure to satisfy any sweet tooth. The menu has a few combinations of waffle, ice cream, and toppings that are chosen by the team itself, some specialty waffles that are a little more expensive, and then a section that allows you to mix and match to make your own waffle creation. I made my own creation and chose the matcha poppyseed waffle with green tea ice cream. The waffle was really good but I found the ice cream to be very bitter and unappetizing. (If you're reading this, don't get the green tea ice cream!) My friend chose a specialty waffle, the strawberry white chocolate chip one, and he said it was also very good. I came back a second time to try the milk tea waffle, but they were out of batter. Apparently, it's a very popular waffle flavour so they tend to run our near the end of the day. There isn't much seating, only a little bench near the front of the store. They also offer packaged Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes, slices and full cakes. A nice addition to the Midland and Finch plaza."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Great decor. Vanilla ice cream has great flavour. Moist waffle. Just the right flavour. Clean. Friendly staff. Time to plan a second, third, fourth.... Visit."}
{"text":"A new HK style egg waffles store in the Finch and Midland area. I've grown up eating these waffles so I always try to taste any new stores that pop up and compare them. I tried to come on the Sunday when they were giving out free waffles, but the lineup was too long so decided to come back another time. Came at around 3pm on Monday and there didn't seem to be too many people. I was able to place my order right after I arrived, and there were about 10 people in front of me waiting to pick up their orders. I got the Match Mochi waffles since it's one of the limited time items, and it came down to $7.90 including tax. One person was at the cashier while 3 people were in charge of prepping, making, and decorating the waffles. Even still they didn't seem to be very efficient. At one point service appeared to be a little chaotic, and I didn't end up getting my waffles until 38 minutes later. I would advise you not to try going during the weekend or expect a super long wait. The person decorating the waffles did put a lot of effort into making them look nice, which I'm sure many customers appreciate since the first thing on receiving the waffles was to snap a picture.  Texture: I was expecting the outside to be crispy and the inside soft and chewy with the mochi. However, the whole thing was soft, which was a little disappointing.  Taste: The flavour of the matcha was good, slightly bitter and not too overpowering; it matched the sweet mochi centre. Overall, it was a little too sweet for my liking, though.  Verdict: the whole experience reminded me of eating a daifuku actually. If you enjoy sweet and soft chewy desserts like that, I'm sure you'll like the mochi waffles. I didn't try the ice cream or special flavoured waffles, but at $6+ per waffle, this experience didn't have the wow factor to entice me to come again. Once is good enough."}
{"text":"On my recent trip to Hong Kong, I noticed that egg waffles were pretty much everywhere. I only ate them once and they were pretty good, though on that occasion I just had them plain.  The concoctions at Golden Bubbles are far from plain, that's for sure.  We walked in and the place was almost empty. I took a look at their list of Signature Waffles and quickly zeroed in on the Bananarama (\"Original Waffle, Bananas, Whip Cream, Nutella, with a Scoop of Ice Cream\").  I should note that the menu at the restaurant does not list the components that are included in the Bananarama, which is an important detail for later.  I received the elaborate concoction a short while later and it sure looked impressive. The slices of banana were artfully placed on the front of the folded waffle cone, while the Nutella was perfectly drizzled on each and every piece. The cone itself was fresh and delicious, too.  But in the center of the thing was a heaping helping of straight-out-of-a-can whipped cream (i.e. it was pretty watery). I thought to myself, \"well, this is certainly a bizarre choice.\" My dining companion also got a Signature Waffle and his came with ice cream, so it seemed mighty odd that mine only had cream.  I checked the website when I was getting ready to write this review, and lo and behold the Bananarama *was* supposed to have ice cream in it! How the dude making my dessert managed to make such a colossal mistake is beyond me.  So yeah, it wasn't the best experience. That waffle was pretty decent, at least."}
{"text":"After waiting about 30 mind, I still haven't receive the waffle. There isn't any special event, but the wait is terrible. Not because there are lots of people, it's just because the employees are working too slow, there aren't enough employees being hired to speed up the process. Also, I can see that some of the ice cream scoops are empty in the center. Not all, just some. I feel so sorry for the people that got those ones, cuz it's not fair for them. Lastly, the waffle it's not \"eggie\" enough! I grow up with this, in Cantonese, the name for this is eggies, you can smell the goodness of the egg! If you go to the second floor of P-Mall, you can smell the egg from the elevator! But here, you can't smell it, you can't taste it (while I'm writing this, one of my order just came, so I taste it, it's not that good). After all, the idea and the renovation of the store is nice, the employees are nice. But the food will not bring me back again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday's afternoon. Waited for about 10-15mins since they make it fresh and there were a few people in front of us.   I got the limited time offer taro mochi bubbles. Gotta say I'm slightly disappointed - it tasted like artificial taro (similar to the flavour of powdered taro drink), but the texture is good and the amount of mochi is generous.  But service was good and the bubbles cone with ice cream has a very nice presentation"}
{"text":"Unique flavours and highly Instagrammable offerings makes this a fun place for dessert! I opted to create my own combination, and so went for a cappuccino waffle with taro ice cream, mochi, and icing sugar. Very delicious, and very filling! Surprisingly easy to eat -- some feat of engineering with the packaging is preventing ice cream leakage, which was honestly pretty impressive. It is a little pricey, given that they're not reinventing the wheel, but they are doing what they do well, and I love it! Can't wait to go back and try the milk tea waffle -- they were out when we went. :("}
{"text":"I was super thrilled to try this place. I didn't make it to try their free waffle event. However, I managed to snatch a 50% off coupon to try their egg waffles.  The decor of this restaurant gave a contemporary and sophisticated vibe.  They have honeycomb theme decorated around the store. You can see it apparent at the ceiling and on the wall. They have TV but it was turned off. So why have it when it's not being in used? O.o  Golden Bubbles is definitely a place where you order and GOOOOOO! There was barely any space to STAND let alone trying to find a spot to sit. There was a small bench but you wouldn't want to sit there for too long. The amount of customers congested at the waiting area will make you want to run OUT of the store!  We were eyeing on the Chocolate Banana Cappuccino signature waffle! It had a cappuccino egg waffle base with two scoops of chocolate ice cream. It also came with fresh bananas, chocolate wafer stick and finished off with a drizzle of chocolate sauce.   The staffs were very friendly. The server who was in charge of the finishing touches of the order was in complete precision.  She was soooooo detail oriented, she took FOREVER to complete each order!! She took at least 3 minutes to cut half a banana. Honestly, it took WAYY too long to get our order. Maybe, somebody could've helped her finish the orders? :( The only good thing was at least each waffle looked picture perfect!  The waffle itself had a very subtle taste of cappuccino. I wished the taste was a bit stronger. The overall texture of the waffle wasn't the greatest. The waffle was very dense and a tad dry. It also didn't have the fluffiness it supposed to have in an egg waffle. I had WAYYY better egg waffles elsewhere.   However, I did enjoy the ice cream. It was very creamy and had strong chocolate flavour but honestly the ice cream tasted like ice cream you can get from the grocery store. Nothing to be rave about. Also, the presentation of this waffle was STUNNING! The waffle was definitely ready for a photo shoot! :) Other than that, there wasn't really much of a WOW factor for this signature waffle :/  I will NOT be returning to this place even with a coupon!"}
{"text":"Honestly, not worth the type.   Waited 20/30 minutes in line during the second week of opening (WHICH tbh I didn't really mind), for a below average egg waffle. I got the green tea mochi filled egg waffle..it was kind of soggy and lacked that slight crunch that Eggettehut (love that place) has. The mochi was good but I couldn't taste the green tea flavour at all. They seemed to have a wide selection of ice cream which is good and the service was good too especially considering how busy they were. Overall a cool concept but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"Admittedly, came here just based on the hype despite all the average meh reviews. I mean did you see all those snaps of the huge lineup when they were giving it out for free?!  Anyways, got here on a weekday afternoon just after lunch and there was no line up at all. But either way, ljne up or not, you'll be waiting about 10-15 mins since your waffles are made fresh to order.   The girl at the cashier was really friendly - she suggested a couple savoury options like the Cheese or the Pork Floss & Seaweed ($6). Following her recommendation, I got the latter. Honestly, the pork floss and seaweed egg waffle was just... okay. The waffle batter didn't have a very strong egg taste that you'd expect from a delish egg waffle. I can't really justify $6 for an average-tasting, average-sized egg waffle. If it was a bit cheaper then this would definitely make a great snack any time you're in the 'hood!"}
{"text":"I saw the hype on Instagram and decided to try Golden Bubbles... and I was disappointed. However, it was the opening weekend, and it is understandable there may be hiccups in operations.   We ordered taro mochi egg waffles ($7) and a mini me matcha red bean egg waffle with ice-cream ($6). Starting with the taro mochi egg waffle, it had no taro flavour, and it was made very moist and cakey (almost soggy). The mini me came in a cup,  half the matcha egg waffle, matcha ice cream, red bean and a wafer. Again, the matcha egg waffle was overly moist and cakey but there was a strong matcha taste. They also didn't use enough batter cause the egg waffles were lopsided (not full - refer to my photo). We noticed after touching the egg waffles, there was a sheen on our fingers - oil?   There was a long line up to order and to wait for the HK egg waffles. The wait to make the HK egg waffles is expected and normal as there are around 5-6 waffle machines, and each batch takes a couple of minutes to heat and cool.   Overall, I think Golden Bubbles is overpriced especially for the taste and quality of their egg waffles."}
{"text":"Pros: Well made egg waffles  Cons: Takes a while to get your order  We just had lunch at a restaurant near by and decided to drop by for some dessert.  Growing up in Hong Kong, the egg waffle always takes me back to my childhood.  The aroma of a freshly made egg waffle is one the many joys of my childhood.  The location itself is on the smaller side.  The workstation probably takes up 75% of the entire store. The last bit is for where you line up.  There's a bench at the front for some seating.  This is definitely a take out operation.  You're not coming as a group and expecting to be seated here.  They have some cake slices here as well but when you're here, you're here for the egg waffles.  They have some specialty waffles with pre-determined toppings but they also have a create your own which I really like.  They have a couple of flavours of the waffle to choose from.  The milk tea one was sold out and that was the one I really wanted, little disappointed there.    Basically, a waffle is $5, ice cream is $2.50 for a scoop and $4 for 2 scoops.  You get a sauce for free and toppings range from 50 cents to $3.  If you're not careful you can easily spend $10-15 for a waffle and ice cream.  It's a bit on the pricey side for me personally, but it's probably the going rate for these kinds of things.  My biggest issue is the wait time for an order.  We came when there was no one else there.  Our order was started right after we made it.  It still took a good ten minutes to get our waffle.  I totally understand the waffles are made to order which is great, but the waffles I had as a kid were made to order and came out within 2-3 minutes.  I can't imagine what the wait time would be if it was busy.  Golden Bubbles definitely brings me back to my childhood.  The waffles are well done and seeing as my little ones loved it too, it's kid approved as well."}
{"text":"Ordered specialty red bean matcha cone. Substituted with scoops of matcha green tea ice cream with one scoop of taro ice cream and one scoop of black sesame ice cream. Added free chocolate drizzle and opted out of whip cream. Total cost after tax came to around $10.20.  This is a much better price than woofles and cream, because my red bean matcha cone came with one small wafer and red bean and free chocolate drizzle. For the same price I couldn't have gotten this much at woofles and cream.   Appreciate that I can substitute ice cream flavour. Next time hoping to try coconut ice cream flavour."}
{"text":"I came with a coworker on a Friday afternoon and there was no wait. Unfortunately the milk tea waffle flavour was sold out so I went with the original flavour, one scoop of vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. The waffle texture was perfect! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The ice cream was also delicious and creamy and went well with the waffle. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Ordered a green tea mochi waffle, since it was only available for a limited time! It was different than your normal egg waffles with a strong taste of matcha. In every \"egg bubble,\" they manually add in 1 mochi from a prepackaged box to the mix. The mochi added an interesting texture to the egg waffle and was really good!   Payment wise, they accept all forms of payment, unlike many other Asian stores. However it was around $7+tax which is more than double of the price of normal egg waffles. Definitely something to keep on mind when ordering it.  Taste 4.5/5 Price 3/5"}
{"text":"Love this waffle place! I had taro mochi waffle with black sesame + taro icecream! love the taro mochi waffle! is so chewing.Pretty interesting... never had a waffle like that!"}
{"text":"I had the $7 Taro Mochi Waffle. It was REALLY crispy on the outside, and it was soft on the inside! There's a melted mochi in EACH bubble. It was a bit too sweet for my liking, but I think a normal waffle would taste better. Would come back to try normal waffles!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give it a try after dinner last night to see if it was worth the hype, and it delivered!  I got the limited edition taro mochi egg waffle with one scoop of black sesame and one scoop of taro ice cream, with sprinkles, whipped cream, and icing sugar on top.   The taro flavour in the egg waffle was tame but you can definitely taste the mochi in every bite. However, the highlight for me was the taro ice cream which complimented the waffle perfectly.   This is more of a takeout place as the shop is small and there is minimal seating offered in the form of a long bench.   Staff: friendly and helpful  Wait time: 15 mins on a Friday night around 8pm Price: a bit of a treat but worth it for the unique flavour offerings Taste: had to practically fight my mom for it after she told me she \"wasn't hungry\""}
{"text":"The only thing I liked about this place is the ice cream which taste like any other  standard regular normal ice cream. The waffle itself is rather disappointing."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the waffles but I don't see what's the hype all about. Yes, there are different flavours and toppings you can put in the waffle but it still tastes mediocre.   I paid $7 +tax for the special flavour, taro mochi. We ordered within a few mins, and waited for our order for 20+ mins. This is understandable as it takes awhile to make the waffle, so be prepared to wait!   The taro waffle had mochi, chewy bits in each cell. I was hoping to eat the waffle with the mochi still intact, but it all melted. As for the tasting, the taro flavour was way too subtle, as if it tastes like the original but with purple food colouring. My friend got the matcha mochi waffle, and it was dry and hard to eat. I honestly prefer the taro one just because of the softer texture. All in all, the waffles I've tried are just okay and mediocre."}
{"text":"came here on a weekday afternoon and there was a short lineup. ordered the strawberry dream and a honey egg waffle with vanilla ice cream and whip cream. a bit on the pricer side for egg waffles in my opinion but it tasted pretty good. the honey egg waffle had little honey popping boba in each bubble on the egg waffle and the strawberry dream just had the original flavour egg waffle and it was pretty good, not super amazing tho. overall pretty good and i'd come back again to try the other flavour egg waffles since they have a wide selection of flavours."}
{"text":"We ordered the taro bubble waffle and they let you put whipped cream and other topics for free. One of my other friends ordered the same thing but added chocolate syrup on top. I think we paid around 10 bucks. It wasn't cheap.  When we got home, both of us had an upset stomach while my other friends who ordered something different did not have an issue.  Interesting concept but I think it's a bit expensive for egg waffles and the aftermath did not help."}
{"text":"Tried golden bubbles at a Yelp event a while back. And i loved it. They do a great job on the hk style egg waffles. Making them crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Heard they were opening a store in Toronto finally, i was so excited for their opening. But i waited til this week to visit to avoid the crowds and lines.   With the ice rain going on, there was only one group of people when i arrived at the store. The floor was completely wet. There were multiple caution signs, but still need a little work done.   What i ordered: Match mochi waffle  The waffle itself was pretty good, met my expectations from my previous encounter with them with the crunchy outside. This is a limited time flavour and im a suckaaa for mochi. So i had to try it. The inside was kinda chewy but sadly all the mochi melted completely and they were mostly just sticking to my fingers. I wish i couldve ate more rather than wiping them all off my fingers lol And there was the matcha bitter after taste which im also a fan of. So i was pretty satisfied. But man, the waffle itself was 7 bucks plus tax. Super overpriced. Can get a meal at that price point. And even with only one group ahead of me, it took soooo long for me to get my waffle. Cant imagine when the store is full of people. Not revisiting anytime soon unless im really craving.   Oh! They also offer the Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes here"}
{"text":"This place has gone viral lately for their mochi egg waffles but the line was too long when they were hosting free giveaway event so I decided to come another day  . I ordered the famously known taro mochi egg waffles with sesame and taro ice cream on top with sprinkles and chocolate syrup. The price kinda threw me off, I was shocked when I had to pay 12bucks for egg waffles  . Disappointingly, I couldn't taste any of the mochi inside the egg waffles, not sure if it's because of the ice cream that makes it harder to feel the mochi but nope, I couldn't taste any of it  When you get to the bottom, the ice cream melts and makes the waffles soggy and taste like taro dough without mochiBUT their ice cream is truly good especially black sesame . Overall comment, this is a one-time thing for me cuz nothing really special about it even the mochi egg waffles was just average quality. I'd rather paying less and get the same quality of egg waffles at other places."}
{"text":"Reminds me of cold stone but for bubble waffles.  Yay: Lots of choices for toppings and flavours The waffle holder is nicely designed  Nay : Personally would prefer the normal ones Seems to be more instragram worthy than the actual taste  It's alright, worth the try but not sure if I would come back for it. There are other alternatives which left a more memorable taste as a snack. One at wong Kwok and the one at Fmp comes to mind."}
{"text":"Loved this ice cream waffle from Golden Bubbles! They have so many options but I went for the chocolate cappuccino one. I also added m&ms because why not?Service was great as well:)"}
{"text":"Where else can you find this stuff. Only in Toronto. If I was a guy who got stuck in an elevator with waffles and ice cream in my grocery bag, I may have dreamt of combining this stuff.  A popular dessert place nestled near Silver Star Rd on Midland Avenue in Scarborough's trail of lined shopping strips.  When we got here there was a lineup of over 20 people on a Thursday night!  We got their signature treats: Oh Canada ( ice cream other strawberries with milk chocolate waffles and Macha ice cream with Cappuccino waffles) The second one is certainly to die for! $"}
{"text":"Yummy ice cream and egg waffles! BEST STAFF EVER!!! You guys are the best!!  They were really talkative and friendly! The taro mochi egg waffle with taro ice cream is a MUST try. So worth the wait..Will come back!"}
{"text":"After numerous failed attempts to visit this place, we finally managed to do so on a week night.  First of all this place is TINY!  This is one of the reasons why it always has a long line, they cannot accomodate everybody inside.  But the decor is very fun and vibrant, which is a plus.  We got the oreo black and white and a slice of cheese cake.  My thoughts about the oreo black and white is that is decent. It didnt really blow my mind, the waffle itself tasted bland.  The ice cream had good flavour.  I will have to come back and try other combos, to pass my judgement about taste.  Reason i gave this a three stars i because their process needs to improve or change.  It just takes too long to make one.  Hence again all the line ups on the weekend.  I dont know how they're going to do it, but they have to fix.  Its true that each waffle cone is a work of art, but the money spent and time is not worth that much.  Over all i would say its worth to visit here and check what the hype is, but to go on regular would not be advisible."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with ice cream and waffles so obviously when I heard that they opened one in Midland and Finch I just had to try it. It's a small shop in the plaza, and it's bright yellow inside, making it very distinct from the other stores surrounding it. I love the variety of ice cream flavours you can get, plus they have a lot of cool combinations for waffle flavours too. And they sell some of the popular cheesecake factory cheesecakes!  My boyfriend chose to have the Matcha and Redbean one, while I made my own and chose Black and White Sesame waffle with black sesame and vanilla ice cream, and they were delicious! It did not take too long to make, plus you can watch them make it right away after making your order.   The only downsides are that they are a bit pricey (if you want to make your own dessert, they have three free toppings but the rest are so expensive...) and there's no seating area too, but still luv it."}
{"text":"Went here around the time it first opened! The wait time was pretty average but there was only one couple in front of us at the time. Their desserts are definitely instagrammable, but they taste the same as any other place.   The matcha waffle was a bit too bitter for my taste but my friend enjoyed it. The berry waffle cone wasn't much better, the waffle was very plain getting most of its flavour from the ice cream and berry toppings.   Staff was very nice but the overall taste doesn't compare to other places I've tried."}
{"text":"Hk egg waffles in cool flavours such as lava cheese, pork floss + seaweed, milk tea, and matcha redbean! They also have mochi waffles in taro and matcha flavours. I highly highly recommend the mochi waffles; they're strong in flavour and the perfect amount of chewiness. Definitely my favourite thing from the store and I will be coming back for more!   They also offer specialty waffles which are ice cream + egg waffle. You can choose from the set menu or you can customize your own.  They have a really large selection of drinks, all of which are low in sweetness, so if you prefer your drinks sweeter be sure to tell them beforehand! They have specialty espresso based drinks (coconut+espresso, lemon+espresso, and coke+espresso). I tried all 3 and I really liked the coconut+espresso one. They also offer a pretty good selection of cakes from the cheesecake factory's retail line.   The space is nicely decorated; the only downside is that there is no seating as it is a small store :( the staff is super friendly and helpful in explaining their menu.  Their grand opening date is April 7, and they will be giving away free waffles on april 7-8 from 1pm to 3pm!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place! Unfortunately, it wasn't amazing but it was just okay. Upon arrival the staff greeted us with a smile and answered whatever questions I had. The staff were really friendly. However, service was super slow. I had to wait about 20 minutes for my waffle order.  I got the strawberry dream waffle and I added a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. It was good, however I felt like I have definitely tried better waffles elsewhere. For some reason it was way too soft, not soggy, but close to that. I understand I added an ice-cream scoop (by the way, they charge extra for that) but other places also add ice-cream and the waffle didn't feel like this one. The strawberries were fresh, which was a plus. I also got to try the dulce le leche caramel cheesecake, which was good but way too sweet for just one person.  There is no seating, it's more of a walk-in place. They are very clean, which is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Really appreciate that they're mixing it up with some new egg waffle flavours like taro mochi, lava cheddar, and and pork floss and seaweed! They also carry interesting, unique coffee drinks like their 'Lemon Cano' which mixes espresso and sparkling lemonade.  The only disappointing factor is that while the texture is really on point, the flavour for their original was really lacking compared to what I've tried at previous food markets. There wasn't enough of an egg taste coming through. I would definitely recommend you try their other novelty options over their original. My pick is the taro mochi!  Also, a huge plus that they are an official Cheesecake Factory vendor so you can purchase cake slices as well as whole cakes - no need to make a trip all the way to Yorkdale!"}
{"text":"This review is late and I normally can't be bothered to leave a bad review. I was one of the people who went for the free waffles during the grand opening. I was looking forward to trying the taro mochi waffle. We arrived at 1 pm and were told about 15 minutes before 3 pm that we wouldn't be able to get any waffles because the line was taking too long. I wish they had cut the line earlier so I didn't waste 2 hours of my life.  They gave us a coupon card for 50% off a waffle but it wasn't valid until 2 days later... I was severely disappointed and annoyed but I really wanted to try the taro mochi waffle so I came back at the end of the month to try it. The waffle honestly didn't taste that great but I enjoyed the ice cream. It costs around $10 regular price. For that price I could get better dessert elsewhere."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype and much anticipation, I dragged my daughter to go with me and was I ever disappointed...went in past 11 at night, no line ups but I had to wait more than 20 minutes for two egg waffles! Wonder why Firstly the matcha mochi egg waffle was too soft and could not taste the mochi at all...then came the taro mochi that was hard and burnt!   Sorry to say but will not recommend or will I try again"}
{"text":"Checked out this place to see what the hype was about! I got the pepper salt and seaweed savoury bubble waffle. Cool concept, poor execution. I watched them put SO much 5 pepper seas salt (sodium overload much lol) when creating the waffle. It was good, but the pepper, salt and seaweed were unevenly distributed. The flavour could only be tasted in patches, some bites peppery, others very bland. I guess it occurs when they flip the waffle machine and everything goes everywhere..? The Hershey chip flavour was also good, but nothing special and definitely not worth $7... I'll have to come back to try their signature waffles with the ice cream inside."}
{"text":"They have flavors like Taro Mochi, Honey Popping Bubbles, Strawberry White Chocolate, Pork floss n seaweed, and Lava Cheddar.  My favourite was the taro mochi and the lava cheddar for savoury pick   Kitchen tip: If you want to crisp up your waffles after you get home, just pop them in the oven at 250°F for 1-2 minutes and they're ready to eat! ."}
{"text":"Store has a bright interior but is small  with no room for seating.  I ordered the \"Matcha redbean ice cream waffle\" - mini size for $5.99 plus tax.  The creation is  visually appealing and worthy of an IG share.  Taste wise, yes it is good.  Just ordinarily good.  Nothing unique or fancy about it, which is expected.    On another note, the store offers slices or whole cheesecakes from Cheesecake Factory.  This alone is worthy of visiting again when the cheesecake craving hits.    Overall experience is decent.  Only setback is the lack of seating."}
