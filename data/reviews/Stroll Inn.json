{"text":"Good pizza and food but the service wasn't very good. Wasn't busy but hardly seen our waitress. Had blue moon on the draft board but was told they didn't serve it anymore. Is it too hard to erase it off the board?"}
{"text":"Been coming here for more than 25 yrs started back with my grand mother, then my parents, now I go there with my own family... 
     We always start out with beer,,,,cheesy bread sticks, then the pizza with pepperoni and pepper rings ...really good... But other food is pretty good also... also have to try the wings... 
      The wait staff are area girls tryin to raise some cash so I don't rip on them so much..
      During lent I'm pretty sure they have fish specials on Friday.."}
{"text":"Icky and SMOKEY! I know they're technically following the law by allowing smoking in their bar, but there is NO divider and the WHOLE PLACE smells like smoke. Had we not taken someone else there, I would have walked out the second I walked in... The food was decent, but unless you want to breathe in carcinogens the whole time you dine, stay..."}
{"text":"This is really the tale of two bars.  

The positive is that drinks are cheap and the food is pretty good.  I've had few things in my stops there and I haven't been disappointed by food yet.  The wings are fantastic, the sandwhichs are filling, and the sides are tasty.  

I go here when i'm waiting my girlfriend to get home from work on mondays and the bartender monday sucks running.  She can't focus on more than one task at once and therefore is constantly flustered which makes for an uncomfortable air in the bar area. I've witnessed one of her meltdowns actually clear a pretty full bar.  Dear owner, this trainwreck is costing you money...you might want to consider upgrading staff.

The times she hasn't been there and a capable staffmember has been working has produced fun experiences.  That said, given the location it is what it is:  a yinzer bar bordering a less than desireable area of town and has everything that comes with it."}
{"text":"THE BEST BAR IN TOWN! The regular locals and experienced bar tenders give this place an \"at home\" feel. I love it! I cannot get enough of their wings and pizza! Better than any other pizza place in Pittsburgh. Trust me, I know, I've been to Italy."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza in Pittsburgh, and the drinks are cheap. It's been a staple of the area for over 50 years. They must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in for lunch after hitting a bucket of balls at the driving range down the street. 

I had a grilled chicken wrap with fries. He had the 1/2 pizza with pepperoni.  

The pizza is Old Forge style with a sweet tomato sauce.  

Nice staff and steady refills on my lemonade. 

We both liked it and would come again."}
