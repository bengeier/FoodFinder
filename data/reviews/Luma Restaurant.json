{"text":"The stacked chicken and tenderloin Alfredo was amazing! The male server made the night complete."}
{"text":"We tried LUMA in Castle Shannon last night for the first time and were incredibly impressed (and don't let the Google picture of the outside fool you -- it's lovely on the inside, especially the outdoor terrace in back).  We had great service, outstanding and abundant food, and terrific presentation -- from starters to dessert!  Groupon introduced us to Luma -- the excellent food (best filet mignon & roast pork tenderloins we've ever had) will certainly bring us back!       Stephanie R."}
{"text":"Food, service, and decor have been excellent every time I have been to Luma.  I have been multiple times and tried menu items from every area of the menu and have yet to find any item that has been less than expected.  Picky friends of ours also said it was one of the best meals they ever had (very high praise from them!).  Luma also offers excellent prix fixe menus, wine deals, and other deals on a regular basis - making their prices even more affordable.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First of all the ambience is really neat--taking it's cue from their name the walls and ceiling are illuminated by slowly changing LED lights.  They also have a heated outdoor area and hip bathrooms.  BTW: the food is great too on our first visit and we will be back"}
{"text":"Had the blackened cajun catfish with asian vineger slaw.  The catfish barely tasted of cajun and the slaw was too light on vineger.  The fish was not particurly hot when served, probably because of the size of our party.  Others in our party had very good meals.  The cappiccino was more like coffee and serving size was quite small.  Still a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, service, and atmosphere.  We have dined at Luma 5 times now and had an excellent experience every time.  I love consistency and Luma delivers!"}
{"text":"Just had my sister's bridal shower here and I can't say enough good things about this place.  The food was great, the ambiance was wonderful and most importantly the staff was delightful.  They really took care of us and went out of their way to make sure the shower was perfect.  Definitely would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Dry over cooked filet mignon with frozen french fries??  $36.00. Terrible. Should never have frozen fries  and a medium cooked filet that was over cooked?  Dry, tough and tasteless. Leather. Disappointing."}
{"text":"They have great crab cakes here, the sauce comes with it is awesome......but the other food is just so so..."}
{"text":"Highly Disappointed Without Even Being Seated I'd like to be writing saying we had a wonderful experience and the food was fantastic, but none of that occurred.  We decided to use our Groupon coupon yesterday the 19th of Nov. at your 186 Castle Shannon Blvd. location.  We called for reservations, but was advised you were fully booked for the evening, however if we didn't mind, we were welcome to sit at the bar.  So we did arrive and low and behold there were two seats open at the bar where you have open seating.  We sat down got comfortable and before we could order a drink, your manager or host, who not very mannerly or professionally dressed, came over and said these seats are taken you'll have to wait for other seats to open up.  Why would you tell someone over the phone you can sit at the bar and when you arrive tell you the seats are taken?  Very embarrassing situation.  He told us we could wait but it may be an hour or so before any other seats open up at the bar.  Another couple arrived and he had them stand in the corner of the bar and offered to take a drink order.  20 mins later another couple arrived who seemed to have reservations.  Your gentleman took their coats, whispered quietly to them, offered them to order a drink and sat them in the two seats open at the bar.  Four other people came in after that with reservations and were sat right down.  I don't understand what was going on, but why did we have to be treated so rudely and unprofessional ?  This is a first of seats being reserved at the bar area.  After sitting there for a half hour, never spoken to again, we just got up and left.  If this is the way you would like your restaurant's reputation to be know as, I will certainly spread the word around.  I will also advise Groupon of my experience.  Highly disappointed without even being seated."}
{"text":"CRABS CAKES ARE AMAZING!  These are the best Crab Cakes in PIttsburgh IMO. I would like to see more of a business happy hour crowd but the I have not had anything bad at Luma."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my friend on a Wednesday & it was 1/2 price for a bottle of wine, we enjoyed a very nice cabernet & had a wonderful lunch. Their crab cakes are soooo good.  We are going back next month, could be a monthly tradition. Loved the atmosphere & great service."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I showed up tonight on a Friday evening for a party of three. There were only 3 other tables filled and the place was quite empty for 6pm on a Friday. I told the hostess that there were three of us She looked at her papers and said rudely...\"I have a table for you... as long as you guys are gone by 8pm.\" I was so taken aback that I said...\"well, I can leave and take my business elsewhere if it's such a problem.\" Very poor customer service. The place was EMPTY! How could it possibly take us almost 2 hours to eat? Ridiculous! I ordered the special: filet and truffle fries with demi glaze sauce. It was more of a soy sauce. It was so SALTY! Not to think negatively, but I can't help to think the hostess told them to make my food bad. I literally after half of my steak and didn't even take it home when the server asked if I wanted a box. I have been here before, very disappointed. I will not return..there are plenty of other restaurants who 1. Will accept my business and 2. The food is better"}
{"text":"We visited Luma on a weeknight early in the evening; when we entered there were a couple patrons at the small bar and one table with a party of two.  Despite all the empty tables we were seated right next to the party of two, which quickly became a raucous party of four when their loud friends arrived.  They were so noisy we were unable to hear our own conversation.  But as we didn't have reservations we decided to grin and bear it.  This was our first mistake, we should have asked for a different table.  The server was friendly and helpful and we had high hopes for a delicious dinner after perusing the menu. Unfortunately the execution was lacking.  I ordered a half portion of the roasted beet salad on which I could not taste any salad dressing.  My entree was the Saku tuna which was nearly inedible due to all the silver skin and gristle that was laced throughout it.  I could barely cut it even with the steak knife they gave me. Once I managed to get a forkful without gristle it was mealy and not pleasant to eat at all, the texture was all wrong.  And it wasn't cheap at $28 - I should have sent it back but I hate to do that.  My dining partner ordered the she-crab soup, which he enjoyed, and the crab cake salad which was fine although somewhat bland.  I ordered the winter sangria which was so sweet it reminded me of Hawaiian Punch.  Throughout our meal the table next to us continued their rowdy obnoxious behavior with no consideration for their neighbors. We were not offered dessert which I felt was strange.  Such a bad experience, never again."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Have always had great seafood and good service, and I have gone a lot!  And cant go wrong with \"Wine down Wednesdays\" (Half off wine and champagne bottles on Wednesdays)!  Totally recommend"}
{"text":"It's ok generally. Fish taco is nice. But it's not a good place for steak. I ordered filet. She cooked it well, but u still can tell its not like fresh filet, more like frozen filet."}
{"text":"Eclectic menu with excellent service. I ordered cod with sprinkling of shrimp, crab on a bed of spinach. Delicious ! My wife ordered duck breast which I often avoid unless I trust the chef; many cooks overcook duck so it's dry - not the case with Luma. Moist and juicy. Dessert was a fruit creamcake - light and heavenly.  Waitress was attentive.  One annoying flaw:  the she-crab bisque while flavorful was lukewarm. The cod was skillfully-prepared was also lukewarm.  The food stood on the counter too long before serving.  With wine, the cost without tip was $80 - a bit pricey, but I will return. The only restaurant that compares to Luma in the South Hills is Bistro 19."}
{"text":"Delightful everything.  Each item was wonderfully prepared and delicious.  Stacked chicken, ginger pork, and steak with chocolate saucy to finish off the meal. I'm already thinking about what I'll order for the next time we go which will be very soon."}
{"text":"Loved Luma! We went during restaurant week but only one of us ordered from the special menu. I had the she crab soup and stuffed salmon and my boyfriend had the grilled cheese dippers, filet medallions with pasta, and the chocolate saucy dessert. Everything was delicious! Great portions and great prices regardless of restaurant week. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had eaten a lunch at Luma before and had a favorable experience.  We went there this evening using a Groupon.  It was a Thursday evening and the place was busy with only the owner and one server waiting tables. It was my assumption that those seated outside in the patio did not have reservations.  So, I was glad we made reservations.  Our server was polite, attentive and helpful.  My wife who is gluten sensitive was directed to a few menu items which were gluten free and the server said other items could be modified to be gluten free.  My wife had the Asian flank steak and I had the pork chop.  We both had salads.  The food was excellent."}
{"text":"I hate to write a bad review (and this is officially my second), but feel the need to share.  A group of us met up last night for dinner at Luma in Aspinwall.  One friend had a $60 coupon that had expired in June.  He called earlier in the day and spoke to a waitress named Irene who had checked with the manager and told him that they would still honor the certificate.  He happily told our table that he would be able to save us $60 off our bill.  The food was good.  However, when we received our bill the friend was told that even though someone at their establishment had agreed we could use the coupon, they wouldn't be honoring it.  It was an uncomfortable situation, even more so for our friend who thought he was doing something nice and offering up his coupon (and who had been diligent enough to make sure it would be accepted).  We ended up splitting the bill 3 ways, two paying with cards, the last with cash - the waiter neglected to ask if the person paying cash wanted change and kept all the money - a 29% tip (to which we kindly ask for the change back).  We all ended up leaving a 20% tip - but I was very disappointed with the service.  After sleeping on it overnight and prior to posting a review - I called Luma to politely explain why I felt they had fallen short.  After 2 phone calls and several requests to speak with a manager I was told that they didn't have a manager - and the person I ended up explaining the situation to turned out to be the same waiter who had given us the bad service.  He said simply that he was sorry and that the owners would be furious if they had accepted our friend's coupon.  He went onto say that he had asked Irene that morning if she had a conversation the day before and given anyone permission to do so - to which he said she denied it.  I refrained from pointing out that it must have just been a wild coincidence that my friend had made up talking to someone named Irene... who, also coincidentally, was working the day before.  I suggested that if they weren't willing to accept the coupon, he could have at least tried to offer up something (i.e. a glass of wine, perhaps a free dessert) to let us know that they appreciated our business and were sorry for the mix-up.  Unfortunately the bad service continued with only meek apologies being served up through the phone.  Luma did nothing to change my mind and entice me to return.  By saving $60 they lost the future business from our table.  Not, apparently, that they seem to care."}
{"text":"The decor of this small restaurant with wooden panels backed by color changing lights is pleasing however the food is not.  The char and quinoa were good but the brussel sprouts were not edible - overcooked to mush.  The server offered to bring a replacement side dish however she had waited til we were nearly done with our meal before checking if all was well so it was too late for a replacement. As much as we want to like this restaurant sadly we will not return."}
{"text":"Meh. I like wine down Weds. Service not great. Food average."}
{"text":"Luma is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I've been here so many times on different occasions and they never once let me down. Tried out almost everything on their menu and loved everything so far. The staffs were friendly and the service was always great. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"You know what this place has always left me with something to be desired. I can't truly put my finger on it, but I have tried a wide range of menu items and have never said to myself \"WOW!\" this is and incredible place. It's good but...is a common phrase out of my mouth here. The last time I was here I ordered a steak in an attempt to allow Luma to redeem itself after my last visit when I ordered a steak. This time the steak was cooked correctly, but there was some sort of off flavor of burnt on the steak. The steak wasn't burnt but it tasted like it had been burnt really weird. MY wife just orders the crab cakes every time and has never really had a complaint.   My advice is just go here and try it, great atmosphere and really nice wait staff. Also around Thanksgiving they offer buy one gift certificate and get one of equal value. We have done this for about 2 years now, but we can't see our selves doing this again."}
{"text":"We had dinner here. It was very good. I only wish there were more than one vegetarian option. The mushroom ravioli was amazing. We had baked Brie, French onion soup, and the Paso Robles Riesling and Cabernet. All quite tasty. Only recommendation (for that fifth star), Please add another vegetarian option"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, finally taking the time to write. I have never had a food item I have disliked. Most things I have ordered more than once. They have a seasonal menu, so be prepared for items to disappear but feel good knowing they are replaced with new exciting ideas. The ambiance can be considered romantic and upscale, white linens, collared wine bottles. There is a patio that is open in the warmer months and closed off/heated in the cool weather. Diners can't go wrong with the Stacked Chicken, Tenderloin Alfredo and English Toffee pudding for dessert. Wednesdays is half off wine by the glass or bottle. Rotating features I have enjoyed: duck apple ravioli, mahi mahi amandine, flank steak with chimichurri sauce, cajun salmon, muscovy duck breast, all too good! Owner Greg Ackerman always has a hands on presence and the staff is wonderful with suggestions. I recommend Taylor as your server :)"}
{"text":"Ambiance - too noisy and loud crowd sitting next to us...like really loud...of course this is not restaurant's fault...but its a part of our experience.  Food - The food was good..but i won't say that it was out of the world. For that price in Pittsburgh, the food should be memorable. It was 4 of us and everyone liked the food.  Service - the service was decent and quick.  I may not prefer to go again because of limited food options and nothing on the menu that i would not get anywhere and may be at a better price...but most importantly....they did not have anything to surprise and keep me coming."}
{"text":"Returned here with a friend for her birthday on a weekday.  Parking was still non-existent on a slow day. We didn't have to wait for a seat, and it was much less noisy this time (though still quite dark, even seated closer to the bar).  Shared a bottle of moscato and a crabcake appetizer.  The crabcakes are phenomenal, but $13 for one cake with a bit of roasted red pepper aoli? No. I got the stacked chicken.  It was cooked perfectly, but the crispy coating was flavorless.  The only thing lending flavor was the spinach and feta between the two chicken breasts, and it was provided sparingly.  The multi-grain couscous was flavorless except for the sherry reduction sauce--again sparingly given. My husband got the filet--to be cooked medium well.  It came out charred in places and was medium rare.  There was red.  I get peeved when a place that charges as much as they do, being located in Castle Shannon, can't cook a steak to specifications. The dessert consisted of the date cake, which was actually quite good.  The cake was tender and not overpowering, though I really wish there were more creative dessert options, but that's a dessert lover talking.  In my second review of this place, I am actually disappointed for the above reasons.  I may consider going back there, but I first want to experience some of the other restaurants in the area that fellow Yelpers have shared."}
{"text":"Luma has been on my list of restaurants to try for a while, but my first experience there did not leave a lasting impression. Not an entirely positive one, anyway. Although the space was intimate and romantic, the food didn't really create an experience that matched the fancy restaurant feel (and not to mention prices). The hubby and I were here for restaurant week so we had the opportunity to sample at slightly lower prices.   The calamari was probably my favorite dish of the night; it was light, crispy, and flavorful. I especially liked the peppers in the dish. The most disappointing part of our dinner was our entrees. My cod dish was incredibly bland: almost as if they didn't use any salt whatsoever. The cod wasn't seasoned, served alongside unseasoned cous cous and asparagus, again unseasoned. My husband's chicken dish was dry, which our guess would've cost around $20 normally and for that kind of price, you'd expect the chicken to be prepared properly, right? Unfortunately our desserts weren't memorable and didn't quite redeem the poor quality of our entrees, but definitely were a slight step higher.   Well, at least they have 1/2 off wine on Wednesday's. I will probably be back for that but I won't be giving dinner a try there again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was talked into a high end grilled cheese sandwich that ended up not being cooked all the way showing the unmelted sliced deli cheese. I then attempted to use my $20 Groupon but was told my \"food purchases\" only totaled $19 even through my bill was $21.25 with the $2.25 coke purchase. I was forced to purchase a $3 salad to get my \"food purchase\" over $20 so they would accept my Groupon. This place is a rip off, they could care less about the customer."}
{"text":"We went to Luma for our anniversary. We sat outside, on their covered porch behind the restaurant. It was a cozy spot, made slightly less cozy by the birthday party table of 15 nearby. But my guess is that on any other night, it's a cute, quiet, cozy patio to eat on.   I wasn't incredibly hungry, so I decided on a salad and an appetizer rather than an entree. The salad was good, nothing crazy special. My appetizer was fried calamari. And it just wasn't very good. It needed salt and overall just lacked flavor. My husband had a spinach Alfredo dish with filet medallions. My husband loves everything spicy, and asked if they could make the dish spicy, which they happily did. It was delicious! I stole a filet medallion and wanted to steal more, as it was cooked nicely! He said they spiced up the dish well and overall it was a delicious dish. I would have to come back to get an entree for myself next time for a more well rounded review, but based on my husband's stellar pasta and steak dish, it's worth coming back again!"}
{"text":"In a word, yum! I love Luma and everything it makes dearly, and it saddens me that I can't eat here more often; if I did, both my waist and my wallet would hate me.   I've had the pleasure of trying and absolutely loving several of Luma's cocktails, its crabcakes, it crab-stuffed salmon, and it's Ahi tuna dish. I have never been disappointed. The seasoning and sauces that Luma uses completes its dishes of perfection. I even liked their scallops when I got to sample those, and I am not a scallop-loving person; something about the way Luma's cooks designed the dish elevates it to a level where even I like it.  I'm not sure why people are saying service is bad here, but I suppose off days happen. As for me, I've never experienced a grumpy face; the waiters and waitresses have always been extremely attentive and really helpful when picking a dinner item or a wine.  Before I wrap up I have to ask, does anyone know what the dessert menu here is like? I've never had any room after my meal to have any and I'm really curious about whether or not I need to come here to just enjoy dessert one of these days.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Quaint little Bistro right out of NYC!!  Fresh ingredients and outstanding service. Highly recommend the Korean BBQ Flank steak!!"}
{"text":"Crab cake was excellent.  The salad was fresh and the dressing was superb.  Definitely will go back to try other signature dishes.  Service was bit slow but friendly staff."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch.  To start: Brittany was my server and she made my dining experience quite enjoyable.  If I were rating Luma based solely on her service, she would receive all of the stars.   Brittany is very professional and very sweet.  I started with the Moroccan/Couscous soup.  It was flavorful.  I enjoyed it.  I wasnt overwhelmed, however I would certainly have it again.  The Grilled Romaine BLT was good after I had let it sit for a while.  I'm not a fan of salads that are ice cold(as if they were pre-made and placed in the refrigerator.) All the ingredients were a bit too chilled for my liking.  The salad turned out to be good.  I also had the Portobello Caprese Sandwich.  It was good.  Overall, I had an enjoyable experience.  Prices are a bit high for lunch, but other than that, all is good.  I would not consider Luma to be one of my favorite places, but I'll certainly be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Great fine dining restaurant with a wide selection of entrees. She crab soup was phenomenal, trout was delicious and coffee rubbed duck breast was unexpected and delightful. There was also a Groupon too! We went for a special occasion and we will be going back in the future. Cozy, upscale restaurant with wide variety of options and reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Since the management change, all the attentive and friendly wait staff is gone. The menu stays trapped in 1985 and all the charm is long gone. Not even close to being worth the time or money."}
{"text":"our visit to Luma was interesting for the fact of there not being a soul in the restaurant at 6 o'clock on a Friday night which we are not sure why because we have only heard great things about this place and is ideal for date night. The service was nothing short of fantastic, very attentive and professional. Food was excellent; we had the Australian berramundi and the pork chops. also, save room for dessert !!"}
{"text":"A forgotten gem.  We often tend to forget about this place due to its location.  But, we often squeeze in a Saturday afternoon lunch.  Luma can just about always be found on groupon, which is always a good score.  We get the lunch groupon which gives you $20 for $10.  It never covers the bill, but its a start.    The food here is very good, but I feel as though its a tad bit inconsistent.  They have changed the way a few items are prepared, such as the stacked chicken dish and the fries were not the normal skinny little fries.  The stacked chicken appears to be battered now, as opposed to the previous times where it was grilled.  We loved the skinny little fries, but they must have just been out of product.    A few of this things I've tried have been the filet medallions over pasta, crab cakes, onion soup, fish sandwich, stacked chicken, and the house burger.  All the food is a high quality product, and I always leave a happy customer.    The restaurant is on the smaller scale, so I would suggest a reservation.  The patio is awesome.  We sit outside any chance we get.  I do however feel as though the interior has a bit of a sewage smell.  This isn't the first time I've noticed it.  It wasn't terrible, but not pleasant at the same time.    All and all, its a quality establishment, with a good quality product."}
{"text":"My friend raved about luma. I was so excited. I hate complaining about a restaurant because people work hard. However ... This was the worst service I have ever received in a restaurant. It was at least 15 minutes after we sat down to even SEE our server. She would disappear for at least 20 minutes at a time. We would order a drink and it would not show back up for like 15 minutes. 3 of the 4 of us ordered steak items and it was like 6 minutes after our meals came that our steak knives showed up. My medium rare filet tasted like liver ... The meat was barely pink but I didn't want to send it back because it would be another half hour or more to receive another one.  I'm extremely disgusted to have spend over $300 for four people and be soooooo disappointed. Nobody once apologized for the delays.  I entertain clients pretty frequently so I visit a lot of places ... I will not ever return to luma. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the other 3 people loved their meals and their dessert.  For me, service is as, if not more, important than the food. I can forgive if something isn't cooked exactly right when the service is outstanding.  This service could have not been worse."}
{"text":"Awesome service, delicious food. Kat was an excellent server, very knowledgeable! Fresh bread & oil was a nice start. I will go back for the calamari appetizer, yummy! Our meals--stuffed salmon & Asian flank steak were very tasty. Wish we had room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Most things are similar to the one in Mt lebanon; only in a better neighborhood with better services.  Crab cake tastes good as always. Dinner dishes are a lot more pricey than ones on lunch menu, especially considering the small portion size."}
{"text":"Good foods at affordable price; good for lunch. Their signature dish, crab cake, was okay, and only 15 bucks on lunch menu. Bad services with little attention from our servant, even though it wasn't a busy day."}
{"text":"Loved the wine Wednesday! Service was excellent, food was excellent as well. The atmosphere is great too, and I definitely want to make this a Wednesday tradition. The only downside was that it was so hard to order because literally everything on the menu sounded incredible! Try the Tuna Poke"}
{"text":"Luma is a wonderful, small, modern restaurant tucked away in Mt. Lebo. I have been to Luma numerous times and have always thoroughly enjoyed myself. What sets Luma apart from other restaurants is not only the beautiful decor with up lighting on the walls that changes colors but also the delicious food. Most recently hubs and I joined BIL and soon to be SIL for dinner on a Friday night during lent. We had reservations but surprisingly, the restaurant was only about half full. Every other time I have been to Luma it has been packed and we had to wait for half an hour. We started the meal with a bottle of pinot noir from the 25 for $25 wine menu. So many great choices for such a reasonable price. (FYI wine is 1/2 off on Wednesdays) In addition to the menu, which changes frequently, there were several seafood specials for Lent. I decided on the Spicy Shrimp Pasta entree and the zucchini fries as an app. The zucchini was crispy and delicious. My entree was was equally delicious with large shrimp, al dente pasta and tasty asparagus. My dining companions enjoyed their meals as well especially the seared Ahi Tuna salad. Service was professional and attentive. The perfect blend of getting you what you need while giving you space to enjoy your dining experience. In conclusion, Luma is a great place to go for a romantic night or a special occasion. Sign up for their emails and get frequent coupons for free wine or BOGO entrees. Also, Luma has a black Friday sale and gift cards are half off."}
{"text":"Very tasty food, fine (not amazing) service, cute and trendy atmosphere  Tables are a little close together so servers seem to have a tough time navigating."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Service is unprofessional. They all look disheveled, don't know the menu, and don't offer substitutions on entrees. They did make an exception for my food allergies on the substitution front, but everything was premade and already covered in gluten-laden seasoning and soybean oil. I ended up eating some veggies and fish because everything else was unsafe. Also, my brother ordered a Hoegaarden and out came a dark brown lager. The waitress said, \"no, this is Hoegaarden. It says so on the keg.\" No, it was not Hoegaarden. After a conversation, she said that it must be Michelob Ultra. Not the same. One server came to the table and when asked for recommendations, said she hadn't had a lot of the menu. What? Isn't that your job? Just awful. I think this will be my last stop to Luma. Bumped up from 1 star because I didn't get sick from the meal."}
{"text":"Funny thing about Luma, I went to Luma in Mt. Lebanon and the restaurant was great the food was good and the staff was attentive although I will say that the restaurant was a little bit expensive for what you get. But all in I really liked the place.   However, I can not say the same at all about this Luma.  The prices were high, the food was not great, the service was average at best. While nothing about the meal stood out as horrible,  when I spend $70-100  (in Pittsburgh) I expect to get a lot more.   As a side note, I found out that the two Lumas are actually under different ownership.   My advice, skip this luma and head out to Mt. Lebo and give it a try"}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  Enjoyed the Brie and crabcakes.  The wine selection was very good and reasonably priced.  Definitely will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"The best thing about Luma is Wine Down Wednesdays.  With 22 wines for $22 ($11 on Wednesdays) and a great wine list otherwise, you're sure to get a good bottle of wine at a reasonable price, which is rare in restaurants.   I have been to Luma on two occasions now and I really desperately want to love it, but the food is holding me back . Let me get that out of the way.  For appetizers, we had the zucchini roulade, which is really excellent and not as heavy as it would seem considering that you're talking about something that is fried and covered in sauce.  I tried the macaroni and cheese and was unimpressed - there were huge chunks of chicken in it that were not seasoned and didn't add to the dish.  The goat cheese puff sounds amazing on the menu but in real life was also underwhelming - it mostly tasted of the mushrooms that accompanied it.    For a main course, I first tried the tenderloin alfredo.  This is a serious dish for a serious appetite.  Although it combined most of my favorite things - steak, pasta, and alfredo sauce - I could only finish about 1/3.  The flavor was excellent.  On my second visit, I had the duck and apple ravioli.  The waitress assured me that it wasn't overly sweet, but it was.  It wasn't a bad dish, it just wasn't great.  Jenny ordered the veal cutlet, and it was amazing - I'll be getting it the next time.   What will bring me back to Luma is the atmosphere.  Last week on a beautiful spring evening, my friends and I relaxed on the spacious patio and had half-priced wine.  Even if the food tends toward the mediocre, it's hard to beat that combination."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!  The service was NOT.  I had a Groupon for the Mt Lebanon location of Luma and as it was expiring, we decided to try it out.  I strongly urge you to make reservations at Luma.  Honestly, it really felt like the people at Luma felt like they were doing US a favor by dining there so if I go back, I will never do so without a reservation.  We called at noon on Friday for our reservation and were able to get one for 6:45 that same night.  The hostess is probably a very nice girl, but she could benefit from a little more training.  When she gave me the reservation, she siad, \"well, we are not going to be able to put you anywhere but out on the patio.\"   it was POURING rain that day, so I was like, \"Um, not thank you,\" and only then did she say, \"Its enclosed.\"  So that was ok.  The interior of Luma was surprisingly hip and had cool lighting effects.  I would definetly go here on a date--but what was also surprising was despite how hip and cool Luma is inside, the average age of the clientele (at least that night) was 55+.  And families.    We were led out onto the fully enclosed patio.  Sparsely decorated but I've got to say it was kind of cool to be out there on a very rainy day bc it was like sitting under and umbrella, I love rain.  Heres what really sucked:  We were seated directly under an outdoor heater.  My contacts were drying out and sticking to my eyes.  It was SO WARM.  There were several empty tables but when I asked to be moved, the hostess said that wasn't an option.  WHAT. THE.FUCK.  So we suffered, and I put my glasses on.  But that really really sucked.  The hostess also said the heater couldn't be turned down, but when she went inside we turned it down ourselves.  Our waitress took FOREVER to come to our tabel btu the 3 times she stopped by she was very nice.     FOOD:  I had the stuffed salmon, and it was spectacular.  My friend had the crab cakes, and I heard they were also spectactular, but he was not sharing.    The problem is the experience sucked so much I just know the food was good but I don't remember much about it.  The weirdest part of the evening is when the hostess came out and started dumping the remains of half drunk beverages over the side of the deck.  ???  That looked bizarre!  She even dumped my coke out right next to me before getting my refill.    Overall, the food was good and I did not think it was over priced.  It was a shame our waitress was S L O W and the hostess/reservations were crappy, but if they have another Groupon, I would definetly be back.  I dont know that I'd go back without the Groupoon, and if I do go back, I'd try to get in the dining room!  ...unless its raining"}
{"text":"Most of our food was wonderful and I loved the ambiance. The chicken was WAY overcooked, but the glaze made it tolerable. The mashed potatoes were super bland. The service was okay most of the time, but the guys had a hard time getting refills for their beers. If it were closer, I might go back, but it's not really worth going out of my way."}
{"text":"Uh.mazing. I've eaten at almost every \"top\" restaurant in Pittsburgh, including most of the ones from Pittsburgh Magazine's \"Top 25 Restaurants\" list for 2012. The only reason I gave it 4 was because service was a little slow. Other than that, the food was amazingly good (and well worth the wait) and fresh.   I had the chicken dish with portobello mushrooms in a sherry wine sauce, lemon asparagus, and mashed red potatoes. The chicken was very tender, juicy, and flavorful. The potatoes were incredibly fresh and creamy with the skin on too. The asparagus was good, but not wow (how 'wow' can asparagus be?).   My husband had a meat dish - I think he ordered the tenderloin - and he said it was amazing. I tried it as we'll and it was delicious. He ordered it medium and it was cooked exactly as he had asked. Juicy, flavorful. No complaints. It was also served with fettuccine Alfredo. I honestly would order his dish just for the fettuccine alone. So. Freakin'. Good.   They have a great wine selection including a list of 25 wines for $25. The total bill came to $85.00 (excluding tip) and was worth every penny.   I recently went to Eleven in the Strip District and paid almost $200 (excluding tip) and thought it paled in comparison to Luma. If there were half stars I would have given it 4.5. Go. Now. Don't. Wait!"}
{"text":"This is a go to spot for my fiancé and I when we want to stay local. The owner, staff and food are absolutely wonderful. I have never had a bad experience here and I have been there a lot. Such a little gem in Mt. Lebo."}
{"text":"An old coworker recommended this restaurant for us and what a great decision it was. I got the crab cake and it was to die for. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice but the waitress was just ok. But even so I would still go back again!"}
{"text":"Luma in Aspinwall is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. I have tried just about everything on the menu and the service is fantastic. They have a great deal on wines. I think most of their wines are $20/bottle which is their niche.  One of Pittsburgh's best kept dining secrets"}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is so right on for describing Luma. It's like a diner imitating a classy restaurant. Boring menu that never changes, uninspired cocktail list and a deplorable beer selection. I imagine they must have a lot of freezers for food storage. Servers go through the motions but know better than to give much of a shit. You seriously might as well just go to Eat 'n Park rather than paying moderately high prices for moderately bad food at Luma."}
{"text":"Went here using a Groupon (which is how I discover a lot of new places!). We came in at lunch and were seated on a gorgeous back patio. Service was amazing, and good was also! I had the signature crabcake sandwich and was floored! I love crabcakes, this one was to die for! I actually am craving one now talking about it! I definitely 100% will be back here! Especially for Wine Down Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is divine! Darren's mom had a groupon for us, and I'm glad we came to Luma to redeem it. I had this salmon with a jelly glaze on it that was so moist and sweet. I also loved the brie and the chocolate saucy, which is a dessert similar to a brownie and a souffle. Very good! The service was great as well and the insides are pretty. Just make a reservation."}
{"text":"A cozy, romantic, tasty restaurant in Aspinwall. It is also reasonably-priced for the size of the dishes it offers. The service is polite and friendly, and the place is casual and relaxed.  We started out with the calamari, which was lightly fried and delicious with the lemony chimichurri sauce. The Luma house salad was tasty, and was truly a steal for five bucks (Frankly, I was expecting a small side salad...). Our main dishes, Sole Monterey and Seafood Pasta, were very delicious. Especially Sole Monterey -- it had some delicious sauce and was a heaven of vegetables. And, the two dishes came in huge portions...  Last but not least, Luma has a 22 for $22 wine bottle deal. We tried out the Slovenian Pinot Grigio and were very pleased."}
{"text":"Luma sits off the cobble stone road on Castle Shannon Blvd.  I was coming from Washington Road and BOOM there it was once I hobbled my car over the bumpy stone road.  The parking lot was packed so I had to find parking on the street which wasn't too hard.  It was a Wednesday night and this place was jumping.  We didn't have reservations but luckily we found seats at the bar which was crowded as well.  My friend had a Groupon which is why we came here.  It was also 1/2 priced wine Wednesdays...but we'll get to that in a minute...you'll want to stick around as this the primary reason I gave them 3 stars.  Lets start with the food.  My friend and I shared the calamari, which was very good although the portion seemed a bit small for the price.  I had the crab bisque followed by the vegetable stack entree.  The crab bisque was great, everything a crab bisque should be...creamy and flavorful, with discernible pieces of crab!  It's a bit heavy in that I was full from the calamari and bisque before my entree arrived.    As far as vegetarian dishes go, I would rate this as delectable and fresh!  From the few bites I took of the grilled portabella stuffed with kous kous and spinach accompanied by cauliflower, I could tell that a new standard had been set for my vegetarian moods!  The standout vegetable was definitely the portabella - it has a smokiness from being grilled but still firm and flavorful.  If you don't like mushrooms then stay away from this dish.    Since I was stuffed, I took most of the entree home to enjoy for lunch the next day.  Now on to the reason why I only gave them 3 stars.  So as I mentioned we had a Groupon and it was also \"wine Wednesdays\" where their wine (glass or bottle) is half priced.  But here's the kicker, you can't use these discounts in combination.    The Groupon already states that it's no good towards alcohol so what's the problem?!?!  Why can't we take advantage of the 1/2 priced wine (since we came on a Wednesday) and use the Groupon...and I get it, from a business perspective you want to make the $ from at least the alcohol if you're discounting the food but it's not very \"customer friendly\".  We even asked if we could put the wine on a separate receipt from our food - the answer, \"no\".  It's just something they can't do...more like won't do.  You have to choose if you'd like to use the Groupon discount or use the 1/2 priced wine discount.    This irked me because without the Groupon we wouldn't even be coming to Luma...are they taking this in to consideration?  I think they should re-think this strategy.  But as I mentioned, the food was very good so if you don't have Groupon issues then check it out."}
{"text":"I will never return to this restaurant.  I regularly dine at some of the best places in Pittsburgh, including Morcilla, Cure, Muddy Waters and Superior Motors.  However, as this is In my neighborhood we decided to try this for a girls night out.   I can't comment on the food as we did not even have a chance to eat it.  The manager/owner was so ridiculously rude and unprofessional that we did not stay.  It is clear now why this establishment is always on Groupon for half off. (Although we did not have a Groupon)  If you are looking for a Mt. Lebo restaurant do yourself a favor and head to Il Pizzaiolo or Bistro 19.   Or venture to Carnegie and check out One Thirty One East... anyplace but here."}
{"text":"I ate here this past week with my girlfriend for dinner.  The inside of the building is decorated nicely with a soothing shade of blue on the walls which has white recessed shelves and some pretty cool track lighting overhead.  Whenever our server came over to greet us, he brought with him some bread and an oil and spice dipping sauce.  The dipping sauce was very good with the flavors of cheese and a bit of spice at the end.  Due to that the bread quickly disappeared and sadly was never replaced.  We decided to start off our meal with the zucchini straws.  The straws came on top of a bed of marinara sauce with a lemon on the side.  Surprisingly, the zucchini was very light and with the acidity of the lemon had a great flavor.  The marinara itself was delicate without many spices which was good so as to not overpower the zucchini.  Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the appetizer.  For my entree I decided upon the tenderloin Alfredo while my girlfriend had the Korean BBQ flank steak.  I was able to take a bite of hers before my own and was surprised at the tenderness of the flank steak.  It also had some good spices on it and I thought that it tasted pretty good.  My tenderloin was also exceptionally tender and paired nicely with Alfredo sauce.  However, the spinach fettuccine that was the pasta base of my meal was nothing memorable but did some needed green color to the dish.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably eat here again in the future but would make sure that it was a cooler night. The reason that I say this is the temperature the night that we went was above 90 degrees and for some reason the restaurant was not cool.  By the end of dinner I was covered in sweat which I have never had happen at a restaurant like this before and which made the experience not necessarily pleasant.  However the food was good and so I would probably go again on a cooler night."}
{"text":"Service, atmosphere, and baked Brie were delightful! I loved the outdoor patio. It is a place that would be great for a romantic evening or a sunny afternoon with girlfriends. Strawberry spinach salad was a little small but the entrees at other tables looked amazing and fairly large portions."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Nice atmosphere.  Great food.  Had the stacked chicken over couscous- delicious.  Good portion size.  Lemon berry cake for dessert was also delicious.  And Wed was 1/2 price wine day, not just on bottles, but by the glass.  Really nice restaurant."}
{"text":"What a great gem to find. Walked in @ 7 and got a table in a bustling restaurant soon. \" It was packed.\" Can't say enough. Please try."}
{"text":"WOW!  I don't give out a lot of 5 stars because my experience with a restaurant has to be top notch. My whole experience was definitely top notch. My son and I had lunch there one day during the week. We always look for smaller places tucked away. This place was not exactly tucked away but there was a lot of construction going on around it. It's a part of a property that has 3 businesses-Hitchhiker Brewery, an attorney, and Luma.  When we walked in we only saw one table full of people. For a moment we were a tad skeptical of eating there but decided that the lack of customers was due to the construction. After we were seated a large group of ladies walked in to have lunch.  I ordered the Stacked Chicken and my son ordered the Entree Salad that was a Pittsburgh chicken salad-complete with fries.  We were given warm bread with some delicious dipping oil. It had herbs and Parmesan cheese. It was a great combo for the warm bread.  Our entrees came and they looked amazing!!!  The Stacked Chicken is two chicken breasts stacked one on top of the other. In between was feta and spinach. There was a finishing sauce on top of it. The chicken was fried but the sauce didn't take away the crispiness of the chicken. I'm not sure what was in the finishing sauce but it was wonderful!  I have never tasted anything like it. There was asparagus as the side and it was cooked perfectly. I took half of my meal home. Usually when you ref eat something it's not the same as when you first ate it. This chicken dish was just as good the next day. The chicken was even still juicy.  My son's salad looked really good. It had big pieces of chicken in it. But it was the dressing that elevated the salad. Again it was some of the best salad dressing. It wasn't a heavy ranch type sauce. It has to have been house made.  Fantastic food with fantastic service =5 Stars!!"}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant last night an was pretty disappointed. I'm not one to complain, but when the waitress takes the fork out of your hand right after you tried a bite off your fiance's leftovers, that's extreme. Stuffed salmon was ruined with a mound of super sweet jelly they called glaze. Fried calamari was less than sub par. They cooked an amazing fillet though. For the price, go to Mitchell's or bonefish. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've been going to Luma since it opened.  The service is friendly, the food is unique and I love the decor.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because sometimes it is a bit pricey given the portion size and  also the service can be a bit inconsistent.  I especially love the outside seating. Since we have such a short season,  I appreciate the heaters to extend it as much as we can.  They even lent us a blanket one night when it got colder than expected!"}
{"text":"What a great new find for my family and I.  My grandmother lives right on Washington road, so when we go out to eat, we always venture to the usual Il Pizz or Sesame Inn, but now that we found this place, I think we have a new dinner and lunch stop.  The decor and atmosphere of this place is beautiful.  I honestly do not think I have seen a nicer and trendier restaurant recently.  The lighting and the bar is mind blowingly beautiful.  If you are old enough to drink you would love this place and the view from the bar.  Now the food hit the spot too.  The french onion soup and the crab bisque were both spot on.  My french onion had Gruyere cheese, which I really thought was a great touch.  Also, my stacked chicken meal was delicious.  There was even a real sized side portion of mouth-watering broccoli.  If you like chicken with mushrooms, this is the place for you.  Hell, if you like good food that is accompanied by a nice atmosphere, this is also the place for you!"}
{"text":"This little gem was the perfect place to hold an afternoon bridal shower. The back porch was plenty of room for our party of ~15 ladies. The service and food were excellent. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying that because I think it's a bit overpriced, I will not go to Luma unless I have a Groupon for it.  That said, Luma offers a LOT of Groupons (translated - several a  year).  In general, I like Luma.  The decor is tasteful, they have outdoor seating options, the staff is always friendly and courteous, and the food is decent.  I have tried multiple menu items over several seasons and I remember them all being fairly good.  The problem is, nothing really sticks out in my head as being spectactular.  I can't pinpoint why I like it, but I also can't really say there's anything about it I didn't like.  Honestly, I can't even remember what I had with the exception of the calamari.  It's quite odd that I keep going back to a place that is good at best and at worst unmemorable.  Well, I'll just go again and again until I've decided one way or another."}
{"text":"I went to Luma last Saturday evening and sat out on the patio. It was my first time on the patio in a while and I was saddened to see that the patio is now shared with the beer house next door. They need to put up some partitions or something rather than just a rope to separate the too. The noise from next door took away from the ambience that there use to be in dining outside. The food however was top notch. The Baked Brie appetizer followed by the Crab Cake dinner  was superb. My companion had the house salad which she enjoyed followed by the Stacked Chicken which she raved over. Attentive but not pushy wait staff."}
{"text":"Okay, so this review is for Luma in Mt. Lebanon... Been there twice now and both times it has been 'just okay'. First time, had the beef tenderloin with pasta in alfredo (something I never get) and it was pretty good. The second time I wasn't sure what to get so I picked an easy one: filet. I ordered it medium, it came out well; the sides of the day were orzo with what seemed like sundried tomato but if was tough to discern the flavor because it had been prepared hours before. The vegetable was a zucchini and yellow squash sauteed in olive oil - undercooked and lacking salt or pepper (a simple dish yet someone was lazy and didn't bother to season it or let it sautee to a put where it was done). Needless to say, for the money I am not going back... Bistro 19 and Il Pizzaiolo are in the same area."}
{"text":"My dear mother, who somewhat resembles Ina Garten, called me last Friday night in a panic!  \"Darren! Darren! I have a Groupon for Luma! It's gonna expire! Luma, Darren! Luma!\"  \"Mum, calm down. What's Luma?\"  \"It's in Mount Lebanon, so it must be good! \"Did you Yelp them yet?\"  \"Um, no. I guess we can go.\"  \"It's for $40! Darren, it's gonna expire! I forgot about it!\"  \"Ok, ok, mum. We'll swing by and pick it up.\"  \"Dress nice. Don't go there in your work clothes. You can borrow one of your dad's...\"  \"Mum, I have some nice jeans and a sweater. Geez.\"  \"You have to make a reservation...\"  \"Ok, Mum...\"  \"And wear something nice. Make sure you take Kay...\"  \"Ooook, Mum...\"  In a little-traveled section of a modish South Hills suburb, one will find Luma (their secondary location is in Aspinwall) on a brick road near an oxidized underpass. Had I been dropped here blindfolded, I would think I was in the East End, and when the two of us strolled in, I still felt that way.   With the ever-changing lights on the walls that segued from a cool blue to an even cooler green put me at ease, Luma proved to be one of those restaurants where I knew I'd be in for a fantastic supper even before I had a fork in my hand, and partake in a fantastic supper we did.   An alabaster wedge of brie began this gourmet ceremony. Baked thoroughly, ideally, oozing, bleeding with a chutney of fresh berries and toasted walnut, we spread the cheese's gluey sludge onto crackers and luxuriated in smooth, lardy, tart essences, saving the waxy, pale cortex for last.   Before arrival, I scouted Luma's menu, and was immediately taken by The Billionaire Burger. Some would consider it to be a churlish dining choice in a restaurant like this, but its description and price (hey, I wanted to get the most out of my $40!) made it irresistible despite Kay's protests.  My doll would kvetch,\"You're ordering a burger? Here?\"   Hell yes I did! The Angus beef was newly ground, adorned with grill mark tiger stripes. Slathered on its underside was aioli. Draped atop the patty was the underutilized bibb lettuce, sweetly roasted tomatoes, and aged Beemster,  a Kaiser roll baked by the finest artisan and toasted by the deftest short order diner cook holding it all in. As juices and dressing dripped onto my hands, I knew I had to continue to eat this burger with silverware as more elegant weaponry was required for this very civilized beast in such baroque environs. I was Kenta Kobashi doing battle with Samoa Joe in a Big Apple ballroom...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gEGHgqcsgA  Caramelized vegetables clashed with crisped dough, acuate cheddar, creamy mayonnaise, and a medium rare, severely succulent ground protein to make for an elaborate burger for an elaborate palate in an elaborate setting. The frites were properly crisp ferrules of chip pan-cooked perfection. No regrets have I.   Kay partook in the cannily candied seafood celebration that was Stuffed Salmon. Flaky, moist, grilled without defect, and captured in the Bay of Fundy, the flamingo-colored fish was stuffed with heavy, humid jumbo lump crab meat and garnished with a Grand Marnier jelly for a fanciful touch. A spoonful of caviar would have been excessive yet welcome.   Dessert was the brownie sundae-turned-miniature souffle known as The Chocolate Saucy.  An exercise in simplicity, white and dark chocolate in liquid form was drizzled all over the whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, and the warm, spongy, salty chocolate choco-chip cake, forming a lake under everything. It's been done before but not with such class. After grandiosity of the preceding courses, all that was required was The Chocolate Saucy's sweet, sweet economy.   The complimentary sourdough bread was thickly cut, rich, porous, and served as a phenomenal vessel for the brie when the crackers were gone. Be wary of filling up on it for its impeccable quality can tempt you into doing so.   Our server was joyful, conscientious, adept, attentive, and had a culinary song in her soul.  Thus, we enjoyed her company. Enjoy Luma with some of your own and realize that Pittsburgh's South Hills are not to be dismissed by lovers of good, good food."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. Tonight I went with several friends as a joint birthday celebration. The cocktails were very good ($11). I ordered the crab bisque , as I am a big fan of seafood chowders and bisques. I was very disappointed. It was not creamy & thick, more like broth and thin. It also lacked any depth of flavor, actually it was quite bland.    My stacked chicken was decent, although the sherry sauce was flat and the jasmine rice was sticky and flavorless. I sampled my friends crab cakes and they were quite delicious.     I chose the toffee cake for dessert, another tasty treat.      Overall it was a decent meal ( except for the bisque & rice).  The menu is not too ambitious and the atmosphere is nothing exciting.     I probably won't be returning anytime soon. There are many other places to chose from that are not so pricey."}
{"text":"Didn't realize Luma had 22 wines @$22 or  Wine Down Wednesdays 1/2 Off Wines.  Good wine list.  So ordered a bottle and it was really enjoyable.  Really good meal, too!    Decor...kind of cool...back lighting behind wood panels on walls rotate from blue to green to purple...like.   Later in evening the place was full and did get noisy.  Started with Baked Brie in puff pastry with apricot with golden delicious apples and red grapes...very good starter.  Had a salad with a creamy danish blue dressing that was so tasty.  Had been told to try the crab cakes, so I did and was not disappointed, crab cakes were very rich and moist with at tangy red onion caper sauce.  Did I mention the crab cakes were great.  Fresh veggies came with the meal that were nice and crisp...perfectly cooked.  Shared a NY style cheese cake for desert that came with white chocolate mouse and raspberry sauce...the white chocolate mouse was very nice addition.  Some of the deserts are made in house but was told the cheesecake comes from a baker.  Wait staff was very attentive...to much so at times...took my wine glass with one small swig left in it...I usually like to leave it there for a while before finishing and next thing I know it was goooooone.  Waitress was able to describe meals and answer questions about items on the menu.  There is a small patio...looks like it might be great place in the spring."}
{"text":"Can a restaurant stay open for over a decade mainly on the strength of one outstanding dish?  If that dish is good enough, Luma has proven that the answer is \"yes.\"  The dish that I'm referring to are the absolutely delicious crab cakes which have been Luma's staple since they first opened.  You can get one in an appetizer or 2 in an entree.  I just had one again on a recent dinner and it was just as good as I remembered.  Big fat pieces of crab, lightly baked with a red onion caper sauce.  Seems simple but they're just magical.    I still think it's somewhat of an aberrancy of nature that Luma serves the best crab cakes that I've ever had: better than anything that I've had in Baltimore or Boston.  How is this possible in Pittsburgh you may ask?  Don't know, but I am hardly alone in my assessment.  Every person I know who's tried Luma's crab cakes has told me that they're the best they've ever had.  Unfortunately, pretty much everything else on the menu falls short in comparison.  It's all OK, but everything fails to reach the heights of the crab cake.  On a recent dinner, after devouring my crab cake app, my entree was duck with butterscotch gnocci.  The duck was delicious, but the butterscotch was a fail.  Duck naturally pairs with sweeter flavors, but this was entirely too sweet.  I should have seen it coming, but I thought it sounded cool.  The gnocci was so sweet it was inedible for an entree (but might have been an OK dessert).  Luma still has a \"twenty wines for twenty bucks\" list.  Actually, I think it's now 22 wines for 22 bucks.  Sounds like a deal, but each wine tastes like a 6 or 7 dollar bottle of wine so it's really not worth it.  They do have nicer wines which are marked up 3-4 times.  If you've been around as long as Luma has, clearly you're doing something right.  The place was packed when we dined recently on a Saturday night.  As long as they keep serving those amazing crab cakes, Luma will easily be around another 10 years."}
{"text":"Surly staff who, if you can find them, give you attitude.  Manager isn't helpful at all either.  This would be redeemable if the food was outstanding, but it isn't.  Folks go because of the groupons.  There are better places to go in Lebo, don't waste your time or your $$$."}
{"text":"We saw this on the restaurant week lineup, and decided to try it, it was a new place for us. Luma is a bit of the beaten path in Mt Lebanon, but worth the search. It's a smallish place, maybe 20 - 25 tables, and very busy, even after eight on a cold, rainy weeknight; I suggest reservations. My girlfriend really liked the house red, and both of us enjoyed our food, delivered well by the wait staff.  We love to try new places during restaurant week, and we'll be coming back to Luma."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner, the dinning room decor was kind of cool w/ bank neon-esque lighting behind wood panels on walls. It is very small and can get very noisy when it gets busy.  The food/service was solid from the beginning to the end, with warm bread and good appetizers from Yellow-Fin Tuna to the Zucchini straws (heavy hand in the kitchen on the breading).  Do NOT ask for the table in the back of the dining room as it is rather impulsive/disgusting... what I mean is, you can literally see right into the ladies/women's bathroom because they do not have a separator/divider that stretches long enough to not see into it, so it is kind of weird and creepy.  Other than that, a very nice/solid choice to go out for a night outside of Pittsburgh, good food, great bar service and good food/specials."}
{"text":"Have been to your place many times but even though you were busy last night someone dropped the ball in the kitchen. Food was not up to par at all, 2 of us had the same thing and came out totally different. Pumpkin ravioli was so dry chef should be embarrassed sending it out. Asked for our sherry sauce which was not on chicken and I felt bad for server to ask for anything since it was made to order..As far as a roasted beet and goat cheese salad.. well mixed greens with a tiny sliver of beets which weren't roasted does not cut it for a salad. Service was wonderful in spite of food.. maybe I'll try on a week day when they have more time to prepare food properly."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and can walk here. We noticed the \"Wine Down Wednesdays\" and made a note to definitely check it out. You would think with the bustling atmosphere of Hitchhiker across the street, this place would take more of an advantage of their location. However, upon arriving at 920pm on Wednesday, we walked in the door and were told \"They were closed\". Lights were on, staff was there. It was really bizarre. I ate here once before and it's not that special to begin with especially when considering the other options in the area, however, this incident put the nail in the coffin for me. Here's a recommendation: Don't specifically advertise a special for Wednesday nights then close 40 minutes before your posted business hours."}
{"text":"My mom and I dined here tonight.  We had a groupon expiring soon that we needed to use.  Now that we know how wonderful Luma is, we know that groupon was a great deal! Our waitress, Colleen, was very friendly and attentive.  Our food and drinks were brought to us in a timely manner.  We ordered the fried eggplant straws with basil aioli for our appetizer, and we also had bread with dipping oil.  Both were delicious and very filling! I ordered the chocolate and coffee duck breast and my mom ordered the Alaskan cod for our entrees, both dishes were exceptional!!  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have always enjoyed this restaurant. As much as we were relaxed by the interior ambiance we also remembered wonderful evenings out on the deck with friends. We frequented the restaurant and mostly were accompanied by friends and/or relatives. We always promoted Luma to others.  Around Christmas 2016 we were offered the buy a gift certificate and get one free. We purchased $50 certificates during the promotion.  My wife and I stopped at the restaurant this evening and placed an order and presented 1 of our certificates. We were told by the waitress as we were settling our check that the certificate was invalid and that it had to be used by the end of 2016. We were never told this while purchasing nor is this information written on the certificate. We wanted to talk to the owner or a manager and no one was available to speak with us. We reluctantly paid the entire bill, including 20% tip and left.  Unless this situation is rectified with the owner we will NEVER STEP INTO THE LUMA MT LEBANON AGAIN.   We will also encourage our friends and relatives to do the same."}
{"text":"The best part of the night was the outdoor seating and the friendly table sitting next to us.   We had a groupon to try out Luma and at this point we probably won't go back.  It seems that the kitchen might have been having an off night because the other table also had issue with the cooking of the food (sent their dish back twice which we also had to do)  What we sampled:   Bread (decent bread, nice that it was served warm, the oil didn't taste like anything.  We asked for butter and received some slices off of a stick that tasted like it was left uncovered in the refrigerator so gross).   Croque Monsieur appetizer (was just ok.  Very difficult to cut so we had to pick it up and eat it with our hands which caused all of the filling to come off in one bite.  Not easy to eat and plated with the saddest looking mixed greens ever (refer to picture)).   White Sangria (decent, a little to sweet, but an ok option)  Seafood pasta (probably the best dish of the night (that's not saying much) the salmon was overly charred in spots and tasted like old grill, but the sauce on the pasta was tasty).   Muscovy Duck Breast with Butterscotch Gnocci (the worst dish of the night.  Asked for the duck to be cooked per chefs request and got the most unevenly cooked piece of duck, one part was medium rare and the other was clearly well done (you could see the line) and the butterscotch gnocci where too sweet and definitely prepackaged)  Overall we didn't spend anything on the meal because they took off the duck from the bill and with the groupon it covered the cost.  We did leave a nice tip for the waitress because this definitely wasn't her fault."}
{"text":"We're venturing into unknown territory here. The South Hills.  This is off the beaten path, so you'd expect it to be a bit \"neighborhood-y.\" Like an old house converted into a restaurant. But even though it may have been an old house, it is ultra modern inside. Then when you walk out back and it's a beautiful deck with a great setting in the back of the woods.   Expectations were then set high for such a pretty place. We hit a couple snafu's as a water glass was pretty dirty, then a wine glass came with floating specks of something inside. I think it might be time for a new dishwasher. But, we could shake that off with a great appetizer!  We ordered the baked brie, as it had been talked up in previous reviews. I'm no brie expert, but it just didn't have that bite it usually does. The outer crust was light and flaky, but the brie itself just didn't taste like it should. I wouldn't order it again.. womp, womp.  I ordered the seafood pasta in a tomato cream sauce. This dish was definitely the best, but still missing some flavor I thought it would have. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not great. I thought the large scallop was delicious, I just wish there was one more! There were two pieces of shrimp and mussels and a handful of crab, so it wasn't a total bust. With Bistro 19 and Il Pizzaollo up the street, I don't think I'd be running here again anytime soon. Well, maybe for the half off wine on Wednesdays. That's speaking my language! Plus, how you gonna mess up that?!"}
{"text":"Just went for wine and dinner with a group of 10 women.  We went for the 1/2 off wine Wednesdays, which makes their reasonably priced wines (I think they have 20 bottles for $22) even cheaper!   I was impressed with the food, I had the pumpkin ravioli, and tried the spicy shrimp.  The ravioli were very sweet, but still a nicer dinner dish, and the presentation was great.   Best of all, the service was amazing.  Our waitress even did separate checks.  The restaurant is tastefully decorated, but the bathrooms were a little freaky to me, and the floors were sticky.    If you're going to try something here I've also heard rave reviews of the steak medallions on Alfredo and the crab cakes (and just about everything else on the menu)."}
{"text":"It is a great great place to sit and have a great meal. It not chap....Have a great time, if you go there."}
{"text":"The vegetarian entree here was out of this world! If i'm ever back in Pittsburgh I'll make it a point to stop here!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed Luma very much. I had the lunch salad with a crab cake. The salad dressing was delicious. I'd buy it if they bottled it. The greens were fresh and cold. My companion had the chopped salad and it was also very good. It's a very small place but has a full bar. There are linen table cloths and napkins. The server was friendly and attentive. I think the prices are higher than they should be. I will go back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"After seeing the high ratings for this place, I was honestly shocked at my experience. I would not recommend Luma as it is trying to be something it is not.  Let's start with the food - the menu looks good, but Luma fails to deliver on quality. While the food certainly wasn't bad, it definitely was not worth the price points given.  The roasted cauliflower was hard. My grilled pineapple was cold (when asked they said they grill it and then put it in the fridge...) and my dad's burger looked like something he could have gotten any chain restaurant.  The crab cakes were not extraordinary.   The service was meh. Our server was friendly but inattentive and slow. It took what seemed like forever to get butter for our bread basket (the bread was actually  pretty good.  Now my 'favorite' part of Luma was the decor.  It was trying to be trendy but the serve ware and the tables contrast greatly with the colored 'ambient' lights that changed colors throughout the restaurant from purple to blue to green."}
