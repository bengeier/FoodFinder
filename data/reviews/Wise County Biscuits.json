{"text":"Our favorite breakfast sandwich in the Burgh! During less busy weekends my husband and I love to visit the truck at Coffee Buddha and grab a biscuit and coffee before starting Sunday errands.  I typically get the build your own with the cheddar, bacon, and fried egg. The pimento cheese and sausage gravy are also too options we have enjoyed. For mothers day I ordered the special package with 6 biscuits, sausage gravy, and berry compote with cream cheese and it was a hit! My mother and sisters were all impressed they were biscuits made from frozen- you really could not taste any difference in the quality between the frozen ones and ones we order weekly. By far one of our favorite staples in and around the city!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today with my wife.  Wise County Biscuits was set up at Coffee Buddha as it often is on weekends.  Since my wife loves biscuits we decided to stop on this day.  Wise County is a mobile food stand, so there's not too much to say about the place.  They cook the biscuits and toppings on a flat top underneath a pop up shelter.  The tables which form the perimeter of the tent are covered in a yellow gingham tablecloth.  For my food on this day I decided to go with the your way and so did my wife.  It is a biscuit with a fried egg and then you can choose two more toppings to put on it.  I went with the pimento cheese and bacon jam while my wife went with the sausage and pimento cheese.  After placing our order we stood around for about 7 minutes waiting for our food to be ready.  While we were waiting we heard that the food stand is called Wise County because that's where the chefs dad grew up in VA.  Since it's his recipe for the biscuits, this makes a ton of sense.  In any case, once our food was ready we hopped in our car and headed home to eat it.  The biscuit here ended up being quite good as it was flaky and buttery and held together even with the ingredients on it. All of the other ingredients were quite good as well with the fried egg having a somewhat runny yolk, the pimento cheese tasting great and the bacon jam providing a salty and sweet taste to the sandwich.  My wife also really enjoyed her sandwich and the piece of sausage that I tried from it had a great rosemary flavor.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  All of the food that we had here was really good and both my wife and I loved it."}
{"text":"I mean, who doesn't love biscuits? But when you don't eat meat, and they usually only come with sausage gravy, you don't get them too often. We got our biscuits with pimento cheese and they were amazing! I'll definitely be seeking this one out again."}
{"text":"These are hands down the BEST biscuits I have had. The sausage gravy biscuit was insanely good, and the biscuit with berry curd was on another level. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"These guys know what they're doing.  Everyone loves biscuits, but Wise County Biscuits also serves them up in interesting ways.  Like, they've got the biscuits and gravy, but they also have a burger served with biscuit buns - plus cheese, bacon, and this delicious sauce - and it was OUT of this world.  They've also got sides and desserts.  When I went they had this concord grape buckle, which was baked to perfection and just really wonderful.  I will definitely be back!"}
