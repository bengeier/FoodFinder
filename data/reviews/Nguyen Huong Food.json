There are so many different kinds of meat, I always get excited when I visit."}

{"text":"For the price you really can't go wrong, $3 for lunch is better than one can get pretty well anywhere else. Places doesn't have the best service and they have mixed up my orders every now and then (mainly the whole spicy thing) but for the price I am paying and speed of service I won't complain. 

I'm a fan of the lemongrass sausage and the plain cold cut personally, they also have some other food items and desserts but I have never tried any."}
{"text":"Overrated.  We really cant decide what was better, this place or its neighbor.  They were both not impressive.  We will not return to Toronto to have banh mi again."}
{"text":"so everyone raves about their banh mi sandwiches (which are delightfully good) but I'd like to draw your attention to......  their fridge counter instead!  (Sorry if it was a bit anti climatic) 

They have an assortment of packaged to go items ranging from fried rice, rice paper rolls, to bun/ rice  noodles that include a good portion of dipping sauce.   I went with the bun/ rice noodles, which came with slices of vietnamese ham and sausage.   True to how local and authentic this place, they packaged the bean sprouts separately in a small clear bag which essentially becomes  your disposable 'bowl' if you are eating on the go - street food style ( basically you dump the sauce and noodles all into the bag with your veggies and let it sit for a while whilst the sauce marinates everything * drools)  

A nice light meal if you are also planning to try other dishes at Kensington market :) and you can't really beat the prices at 3.50 including tax!  

Highly recommend if you plan on visiting the area !"}
{"text":"I love Nguyen Huong so much. They've steadily raised their prices on their viet subs (BBQ pork is now $3) but I don't even care, they deserve it. $3 gets you a fresh, crispy french bun filled with delicious BBQ pork, crunchy carrots, (sometimes) sweet grated daikon, a slice of cucumber, fiery peppers and a splash of mayo. I have to restrain myself from trying to eat there every day."}
{"text":"I've had a few cheap banh mis around town and this is the best deal so far. The bread is fresh and there are quite a few options. I also appreciate that the portions are not so huge - but still filling."}
{"text":"I am glad to add this little Vietnamese store to my list of favorite banh mi sandwiches.  I will surely make this a staple eatery upon future visits to Toronto.  It's a no-brainer, especially when you consider the value Nguyen Huong Food offers up!

Be prepared to feel a bit out of place if you don't speak Vietnamese.  But just walk up to the glass counter... State what you want... and watch the magic unfold.

I ordered the Lemongrass Tofu banh mi ($1.75), the BBQ Pork banh mi ($2.25), and a can of Coca-Cola ($1)... for a whopping total of $5.  Are you kidding me!?!  That's so cheap for the amount of food you get.

I hadn't planned on eating both sandwiches, but I ended up eating it all.  It was great.  The bread was a crispy baguette.  The carrots and cucumbers tasted great.  As always, the cilantro makes the sandwich.  The lemongrass tofu was better than the bbq pork, but both were good.

This shop doesn't make the best banh mi I've ever tried, but it ranks right up there.  However, they are the best banh mi I've had for that price range."}
{"text":"The best of the Nguyen Huong outlets with a great selection of freshly-made Vietnamese snacks at an affordable price. My favourites are their bot chien (stir-fried rice cakes with eggs and scallions), banh cong (crispy fried mung bean and shrimp muffins), and banh da lon (chewy and gelatinous steamed pandan-flavoured cakes filled with coconut-flavoured mung bean paste)."}
{"text":"Much busier than the bahn mi shop right next door. The bread looks more like a hoagie roll than the thinner longer baguettes that are typically used. I had the barbeque pork which was pink, but not grilled. It was sweet like Chinese barbeque pork and tender. Great quality and delicious if not traditional."}
{"text":"Had the shredded pork bahn mi. This was delicious.
Small for 2.50, Large for 2.75. How crazy.

I saw them making stacks of cold cut bahn mi, with no fillings inside. Maybe they were premaking them so that all they have to do is put in the vegetable fillings as the custom desires."}
{"text":"This small shop might not seem like a lot from the outside but wow their food speaks for themselves. I've been on the hunt for authentic bahn mi in Toronto ever since I moved here. Now, I can confidently say that Nguyen Huong will be my go to bahn mi shop in Toronto from now on. Golden baguette filled with salty, fatty deli meats which is toned down by perfectly pickled vegetable. From the first bite to the last, I was immensely happy. When you go, please don't overlook the fridge section. I bought a Che Ba Mau and it was beyond delicious. Don't let the simple packaging deceive you. This place is definitely not overrated."}
{"text":"This as become my new favourite place when I want something cheap and fast. The price of their sandwiches is ridiculous. For $3 I can have a full meal. The sandwiches are tasty, they have lots of different meats to choose from that are not available at other viet sub places like Banh Mi Boys - e.g. cured pork, pork skin, lemongrass sausages. You can also add pate to a sub to make it even more delicious. 

Whenever I go shopping at Chinatown I always pick up a sub for dinner and another one for lunch the next day. You can probably keep the subs in the fridge for up to a day."}
{"text":"Super inexpensive, they are most well known for their traditional banh mi which are $2.50 for small and $5 for large (it's massive).  I also like to get the summer rolls  ($3.50). Comes in a pack of 4 with dipping sauce. They have viet coffee here as well ($2.75), very strong coffee but a little too sweet for my liking. 

Great place to go to if you are looking for inexpensive lunch along Spadina. Just be mindful that it does get really busy at around noon. They are pretty quick with their orders, but if you want to avoid the line up all in all, come here before noon."}
{"text":"I wanted to grab a quick dinner and this place has already prepared food that is cheap/ affordable. 

This place isn't just for banh mi, they have other food choices in their display counter such as spring rolls (variety in meat and veggie available). I bought fried rice ($3.50) plus spring rolls ($1 each). I know it's not the healthiest (oily on the bottom) but it's great for the wallet. 

I've had their banh mi before. I love the BBQ chicken option. Super good!

Ok food for a cheap price.... Sounds like a good deal to me."}
{"text":"Have a hankering for a tasty little Vietnamese Sub? Then this is the spot, the only spot in downtown that really does it right. 

Vietnamese Subs aka banh mi are french influenced sandwiches (mainly the baguette like bread and pate) used along with traditional Vietnamese cold cuts, cilantro, carrots, and radish that make for an inexpensive lunch. Choose between spicy or not - small or large, $1.75 for small and $2.25 for a large. 

The small little shop also has other varieties of Vietnamese pastries, spring rolls and other small dishes but the subs get all my attention."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype with this place, yes the sandwiches are very cheap, but you get what you pay for, it is low quality luncheon meats on a baguette. I did not find the bahn mis here very good, the meats were all too salty or mushy. Some looked quite old behind the display case. Yes it is cheap, but that is the only positive thing I can think of for here."}
{"text":"My family knew the trip back to MA would be rough, therefore we decided to order a whole load of banh mi. I could see why this place has such high reviews. The price is unbeatable, back at home, the price for a sandwich is $2.75+, maybe $3 now. They're sandwiches are good, I ate like 4 while cruising back home. There is a special recipe that they have in it, it is their pepper. It is extremely spicy and good! Do they dry it? I don't know but I wanted to grab the bag of pepper and throw it all in my mouth.

 --drools"}
{"text":"very delicious sandwich they have. fancy Vietnam secret sauce! cheap price! My friend just snatch half of sandwich from my hand!! it's really yammy"}
{"text":"This is THE place to go for cheap and delicious viet subs
I have dreams of going to this place (and then I do in the morning)
The only complaints I have are that, the place is usually so packed .. and the bread is super hard.. I usually wait til it gets softer... then it's even more delicious .. yummmm I wish I had one now."}
{"text":"A childhood favourite.

Food: This place is always consistent. The right amount of toppings on each banh mi. I had chè (Vietnamese liquid dessert) from here before, not sure if they still have it, which was good. I really enjoy their bánh uot (thin pancake wrapper), vietnamese sausage, bánh hoi and other snacks. The pâté that is inside the banh mi can also be bought on its own! It can be spread on toast and tastes mouthwatering great!

Atmosphere & Service: Quick and efficient. When you watch the staff make the banh mi, it sort of looks like an assembly line. Inside is a bit cramped when it gets crowded. Great place to grab something and go.

Pricing: I just get the $2 banh mi. Everything seems reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Classic banh mi at a great price.  Grabbed 10 banh mis for my trip back to the states and we finished 5 of them before we made it home.  The bread is super soft and the cold cuts were perfect with the pickled veggies."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for Bahn Mi!
Can't go wrong for $2!

Ask for the spicy option.. *drool*"}
{"text":"This place was my discovery of the month! 

It has also sorted out my compulsion to snack at odd hours of the day and night by allowing me to buy 5 banh mis for $10!

I just walk in, ask for five spicy and BANHMMM! I am on my way home and these will last me 2/3 days easy. in the fridge.

Dont know about anyone else but I tend to heat mine in the microwave for one minute to make the bread softer.

I have also been known to buy the spring rolls which for a $1 each are great combos to mix in one of my home made curries. 

Banh Mi Boys has a more kick ass range and taste better but for price this place wins on most days when all I need is a hunger killer especially for lunch and late night cravings."}
{"text":"I've been eating banh mi from this place since I was a kid, and it easily set the standard for which I use to rate other banh mi places for:

Taste
Consistency
Freshness and quality 
Authenticity

One of the must tries if you're in the Chinatown area."}
{"text":"This is my favourite stop for a Vietnamese sub (Banh Mi)

It's crowded and small. But it's a very quick in and out ordeal. 

Breads are made fresh and have a crispy outter layer. 

Make sure you the sub you get is made to order. Do not take the pre-packaged one. 

I had a pre-packaged one when they were closing. The bread was soggy and it was just a mess. Do not settle."}
{"text":"Excellent banh mi! More expensive than they used to be, but still cheap and tasty. Cash only but there's no shortage of banks nearby. Can't comment on the hot food or groceries, but the place is always busy with people doing their shopping, so I'm sure you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This place is a tiny prepared food mart. Seems like it is full of vietnamese specialties. It was open early in the day and then was really crowded when we went by. 

Really delicious bahn mi. There were already standard favorites wrapped up at the counter for you to grab and go. However, we got the spiced pork which was specially prepared. The pork was kind if a mix between pulled pork versus sausage. Very very tasty. Nothing like the usual grilled meats. And makes it really good for bringing it to go! Even after a heavy drizzle and bringing it around for 3 hours, the bahn mi was like it was freshly made! Not soggy. Just tasty! 

Sweets/desserts are also available! 

There's no place for you to sit and enjoy but this is a great place for a cheap take out or getting food for picnics!!"}
{"text":"Talk about stiff competition right next to each other, but the banh mi here is slightly better than next doors.


BBQ Pork Sandwich:

The bread is nice and crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside. Their pork is sweet and savory with a non-tooth-breaking texture. Full of bright flavors, this sandwich is a great quick meal for $2.00."}
{"text":"Simple, cheap, efficient, no frills and delicious. No fancy pants, Western-style appeal like Banh Mi Boys. $2-4 is about the most you can expect to spend if you have a normal human stomach.

If you're not so into the the banh mi, they have various kinds of prepackaged Vietnamese spring rolls so you can grab and go. The overpackaging (styrofoam AND saran wrap) make me a little queasy but I guess it's the price you pay for convenience!

A great place to run in on the way to class, an appointment, to the subway, streetcar, etc. etc. You can be in and out in 5 minutes. Love it!"}

{"text":"We got two sandwiches (3.5$ each), spicy sausage and bbq chicken. We didn't get sick! yay.

The sandwiches were good BUT under-filled. Towards the tips of the bread you're eating just bread without any filling. However, they have sausages and cold-cuts that you can buy separately (from the refrigerated space across from the counter). You can get those and stuff your sandwich as you wish."}
{"text":"Incredible. Cheap with great food. 5/5

The Small Assorted Cold Cut is full of meat and veggies. No tax, only $2.50 for lunch. It tasted a lot better than Subway's 6 inch sandwiches. mayo, pickled carrots, pork and coriander. It didn't have a lot of seasoning, but you'll be fulfilled with the cheap sandwich. Great to grab when you're hungry in Chinatown. 

I also wanted to try one of their plates. I had one for only $4.50 with noodles, sweet sauce, pork sausages, Char Siew pork, some veggies and a huge spring roll. It was honestly better than some Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto. I couldn't say weather the meat was fresh (probably not, and I don't care), but the taste was fantastic. Sweet and meaty. The spring roll was also full of meat (I think its beef), and it tasted better than the sandwich! 

If you don't want to eat a sandwich, go grab a plate. The portion was so big I had to finish it as both lunch and dinner. Love, love, love this place. Will visit again."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS
Pretty good banh mi sandwiches and ridiculously cheap. The most expensive is like $4. The French baguette is fresh & as are the vegetables. BBQ chicken and cold cuts sandwiches are the best, can't go wrong. For someone who hasn't been here you basically order from the cashier & not from the sandwich maker. Don't forget to let them know if you want spicy or not. 

On weekends I avoid Chinatown like the plague. By some freak accident you find yourself here, expect crowds of people in this little store fighting to buy banh mi."}
{"text":"This is the classic Vietnamese sandwich joint on Spadina and they make a delicious rendition of the traditional French bun. I had a large sausage version which cost $3.50 and it was worth every penny. From the first bite into the crusty bun that could easily attack the roof of your mouth, it was obvious that the bun was fresh enough not to do that. Second bite gets right into the wonderful flavours that make up Bhan Mi, with crunchy carrot strips that do not bite back, and an amazing barbeque taste with a nice salt balance from the sausage. The spiciness I asked for was perfect too! And they are quick to whip together a perfectly assembled sandwich so no waiting around. Bring cash and as the sign says, 'no pictures or videos please' so respect them for that. A wonderful place with aromas that will set your appetite in the mood, especially when they are frying a bunch of radish cake on the grill. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"OK...this is outrageous.  

Nguyen Huong Foods is known for their Bánh mì or Vietnamese sandwiches.  

What exactly is a Bánh mì or Vietnamese sandwich?  Well, a  Bánh mì is a tasty fusion by-product of French Colonialism, taking a French Baguette, adding in rice flour (historically to cut the cost of imported wheat flour) to create a tasty, airy bun with a crispy crust, and adding in a slathering of a sort of mayonnaise spread, some pate, cilantro, chilis, daikon and carrot and a portion of Vietnamese cold cuts.

From the Austin Chronicle:

\"France ruled Indochina for about 100 years and introduced sandwiches to Vietnam. In the old days, the French would go to their delis to dine on wheat baguette sandwiches stuffed with pâté, sausages, butter, cornichons, onion, and radish. As time went on, these \"French sandwiches\" (bánh mì Tay) became a status symbol for Vietnamese who put on airs and wanted to be considered French, causing popular cheaper copies to spring up around the country.\"

They used to sell these for $1.50...then the price went up to $1.75.  

OUTRAGEOUS.  Outrageously good value...and one of the best on-the-run-buns you can find.

This is approaching $2.00 for a delicious, tasty, fresh lunch that gives you change on a toonie!!!

BUT, that's not all, if you like vermicelli dishes with grilled pork, sausage and spring rolls, salad rolls or other asian take out goodies, you will find a huge selection here all priced under $4...a tasty tasty bargain that would find you paying over twice that amount if you wanted to sit down and eat it at a resto up the street.

This is ALL super high value tasty stuff...and really makes you wonder how you could look at that brown bag the same way ever again."}
{"text":"- can't go wrong with a delicious $2.50 banh mi sandwich
- great bread. assorted meats is the king
- hits the spot, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Happiness and comfort food for me is this place. I've gone here for over a decade, yes the price has steadily increased but even 14 years ago when I first started going there the current $2.50 price tag would've been more than fair.

When I can walk into the place and they know my VERY specific sandwich, I can't help but be pretty stoked about it.
Because I order the veg option only, I say this is the best traditional no frills veggie banh mi in the city. I can't speak about the meat. I also don't have the butter or mayo... But the tofu is that flavorful and the \"extra hot\" peppers make me cry, in a good way. Of course you can also get no spice at all. 
Try it with $1.25 mr Browns iced coffee and you're laughing!"}
{"text":"Banh mi is one of my favorite sandwiches and the version I had at Nguyen Houng Food was as good and as cheap as any I've had all around the US. The Spadina Chinatown area is jam packed with banh mi houses but from the reviews this was a must stop during my eat around afternoon. A little more confusing to order than the Americanized Banh Mi Boys down the street since the servers don't speak strong English, but, after some pointing, I got it across that I wanted a dac biet (assorted cold cuts) and the BBQ pork sandwich to go.

Both the meat combinations were versions that I would love to have in Rochester and the bread was top notch as well. The cold cuts included both head cheese and white pork lunchmeat and had a solid helping of pate which made for a great combo. Cold BBQ pork that was rich without being overly greasy and had solid texture. Crisp, crunchy exterior and chewy interior that held up well to the seasonings and meats. The veggies were pickled properly and helped add some acidity to the richness. The best part, other than the high level of execution, was that the two sandwiches came to a total of just over $5. What a damn deal!"}
{"text":"This place is great. It has amazing bahn mi. The prices can't be beat at 2.50 for small and 5 for lArge. The sandwich never disappoints."}
{"text":"Large spicy.  No bacon.  No mayo.  $2.75.  

Cheapest meal you can get with the four food groups (if you get the mayo).

Bread, meat, veg, and dairy."}
{"text":"It's between this place and bale 2 for me. I feel like this place just got drowned a bit on the hype. Their sandwiches are a bit bigger than bale but I like the sandwich at bale to be a bit better. Not to say that this place is bad, it's quite good for the price as well. 

I usually get the bbq pork sandwich, but I pretty much like all the sandwiches here. They've also got a nice assortment of prepared rich and noodle dishes that are very well priced. 

Overall, great place if bale2 is closed and you're craving some banh mi."}
{"text":"Solid banh mi sandwiches that are perfect for grabbing a quick lunch. While this place used to be my \"to go\" place for banh mi, the meat portions have been gradually getting smaller and smaller, making the sandwich mostly bread and pickled veggies. However, when I do stop here, I usually get the grilled chicken and meatball sandwiches, both of which have a lot of great flavours. 

The other item I usually get is the rice platter that's around $5 each (you can find this in the fridge area opposite the cashier). They're similar to the \"grilled pork on broken rice with steamed egg\" sort of dishes at most Vietnamese restaurants. They're incredibly filling, tasty, and inexpensive. Also, if you're a fan of the pate they use in the sandwiches, you can head to the very back of the store and buy some to take home - perfect for making your own sandwiches at home, or adding more pate to the banh mi sandwich you buy.

Overall, this is a good place to visit for banh mi sandwiches, and while the prices are cheap, know that you're getting what you pay for. Those looking for a hearty sandwich or comparing it to the generous meat-filled sandwiches at Banh Mi Boys may be disappointed. Still, it's worth visiting for sure since there's a reason this store is consistently busy throughout the day."}
{"text":"The bahn mi here is great, and if I were just reviewing the food, I'd give it a 4/5. However, the rating of a restaurant also lies in the price they ask for their product, and the price that Nguyen Huong asks is a mere pittance compared to some other Bahn Mi chains in Toronto (cough cough). For $3 (no taxes), I can get myself a sandwich that fills me for a meal. I'll convince myself to eat there to save money over cooking sometimes."}
{"text":"Very cheap banh mi. I didn't think it was that good but definitely worth it for the price. 
They don't toast the banh mi for you so it is cold. 
I think it's more for togo and heat up before eating."}
{"text":"Fresh sandwiches. Low price at $2.50 for a small and $3 for a large(r), tax included.
Pick your meat, pick your spice, done. Note that they just drop a whole chili pepper on you, and not hot sauce, so they're not playing around.

They also have other meats available for sale, as well as packaged meals that are pretty affordable as well.

Great place to drop by to pick up a snack."}
{"text":"Probably the best Banh Mi (or Vietnamese sub sandwich) place in GTA.. It's been around for a long time...with consistent quality. 

Just thinking of it makes me drool, in every bite you get the light and crispy baguette, a smearing of house-made liver pâté and bites of Vietnamese cold cuts, and then there is tangy-sweetness of daikon/carrot pickle, cilantro, and chili pepper (if you choose \"spicy\"). 

I've always order a large, but I think the small is of the same size just less meat/fillings. 

It's a bakery / food mart, so no place to sit down, but there are plenty of places nearby to grab a drink and a seat or eat it like street food."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge bahn mi fan back in the days, but after I moved I was never able to find cheap authentic bahn mi until today. After more than 6 years of bahn mi craving my life has changed after discovering this place.
For $3 a Bahn Mi, there's so much value!!"}
{"text":"Cheap. Delicious. Healthy. What more can i say? Place is sketch, yeah, but it's never made me nauseous which is a lot more than I can say for some of the other restaurants out there. I go for the $2.50 (used to be $2) tofu lemongrass sandwich and buy 5+ at a time. Their salad rolls are also super delicious and filling :3"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I have been going here since I was a little girl when the banh mi sandwiches sold for $1!  Yes, they only use to be $1.  So ten years later, inflation has doubled the cost, but the taste is still exactly the same.  It hasn't changed one bit.  I suppose that is due to the fact they are the sole supplier of all their ingredients.  No middleman costs here!  They bake their own buns, they make their own assorted meats, sausages and pre-packaged meals.

This place is really the go to place, if you want a quick and filling lunch on the go.

Tip: Try the assorted meat banh mi and add the BBQ pork (there's no such thing as a meat overdose)  ;)"}
{"text":"Got the banh mi thap cam. Delicious and cheap Vietnamese subs! The pickled carrots and radish is my favourite part."}
{"text":"Nguyen Huong always brings me on a trip down memory lane.  Back in the early 90's when the Chinese population was not invading all the various townships of Toronto - we all had to take that weekly trip down to either East or West Chinatown for all our Chinese grocery needs.  This was before TNT, Foody Mart, etc came and robbed the downtown Chinatowns for their business.  It was also before we started urban sprawling out into Markham, Richmond Hill... okay, we're everywhere!  You can run from us, but you can't hide!

Nguyen Huong is THE original bánh mì (Vietnamese sub) shop of Toronto.  I always thought to myself that if I were ever unfortunate enough to have to become homeless *knocks on wood* that I would for sure get my ass to a bánh mì shop.  Where else can you get full for $1?  Its a perfectly-balanced meal too... Carbs, veggies AND protein.  Can't get any better than that.

Well fast forward 10 years now, and due to inflation, unfortunately, you can no longer find a $1 bánh mì.  But it is still a reasonable price to pay.  To put it into perspective a $2 bánh mì or a $4 sub from Subway?  I'll let you do the math!

Other than bánh mì, they sell other Vietnamese goodies ranging from rice noodle rolls, to Vietnamese sweets such as chè dau  (sweet soup made with beans, glutinous rice and coconut milk).  

I ended up picking up a tray of goi cuon(Vietnamese summer rolls).  I got a tray of 4 (2 grilled pork, 2 shrimp) which came with a hoisin-peanut dipping sauce for $3.50.  At first glance you'd think this was more of an appetizer... but they are unbelievably filling, not to mention tasty and healthy!  Of Asian cuisines, I always found Vietnamese food to be one of the healthier alternatives as they use a lot of bean sprouts, and vegetables in their dishes.

It is establishments like Nguyen Huong that make me wish I worked in closer proximity to Chinatown, so that I could have access to yummy foods for a fraction of the cost!"}
{"text":"Starving?  Got some pocket shrapnel? Then you can't go wrong here but def is no destination."}
{"text":"Whenever I make my way to Toronto, I make sure I get my hands on some banh mi from Nguyen Huong. And if I don't, I make sure my parents come back to New York with them as \"souvenirs.\" I've been frequenting this place ever since I was a little girl and I just can't get enough of their classic banh mi with assorted cold cuts. As with all inflation, the prices continue to go up over the years but at a meager $2.50 currently for a classic banh mi, it is such a steal! I have to admit, I always order the same thing over and over whenever I am here so I cannot attest for their fancy banh mi with the lemongrass this and the BBQ that, nor have I ever tried their other items such as prepared cold noodles or desserts. Quite honestly, the whole place looks quite questionable in terms of cleanliness because it looks so damn ghetto with its creepy white hospital-like lighting but I don't care! I love this place and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"$2 for Small Banh Mi.
$2.50 for Large Banh Mi.

Small store filled with loads of Meats, Ready to eat meals, Snacks, Desserts and Banh Mi. Prices are very reasonable and their sandwiches are prepared well. They offer a number of different Vietnamese Sandwiches (ie. Garlic Honey Sausage, Lemongrass Sausage, Shredded Chicken, Meatball, BBQ Pork, Sardine, Vegetarian). One of my favorites are the Assorted Sandwich. 

The baguette is slightly toasty and chewy. Once you purchase your sandwich, I suggest you eat it as soon as possible. The longer you wait, the harder the baguette seems to get. It's not the best baguette out there but still good. The meats were flavorful. The veggies were fresh for the most part. Cilantro was a bit bruised. Overall, a tasty and memorable banh mi.

There is no seating available. This is a grab and go kind of place. You can ask an employee to wrap the veggies that come with the sandwiches separately. This way the veggies won't make the baguette soggy by the time you are ready to eat your sandwich. You have the option of getting your sandwich spicy (w/ jalapeños) or not. Everything in the store looked so good. Next time, I'm going straight for their ready to eat meals and desserts. 

It's really packed in here and the store is small. Things can get a bit disorganized. Do your best to get an employees attention. Service is speedy.

Looking for a quick bite? Don't want to spend a whole lot? Nguyen Huong to the rescue."}
{"text":"I'd rate it between 3.5 and 4 stars. It's a no frills (funny that the term was used by several Yelpers already) type of place for bahn mi. The sandwich is pretty big for its price and filling is flavourful. You can choose whether to add hot sauce to your sub. What I do not like is that the bread can be a bit hard for me. When it comes to Vietnamese food I prefer their rice and noodle dishes but banh mi is decent for a nice light lunch.

The package for the sub says that they have multiple locations across GTA (downtown, Vaughan, North York and Scarborough) which is great if you crave a banh mi in another part of the city."}
{"text":"$3 banh mi.

$3 BANH MI!!!!

LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK.


I always order the #1 (cold cut meat). I'll usually get it non-spicy, but if I'm feeling adventurous, I'll go for the spicy version. Eating a spicy sandwich at Nguyen Huong is like playing a game of russian roulette. You'll go through half of your sandwich without any trouble and you'll have that mini existential crisis where you wonder if you imagined asking for a spicy sandwich. And then, when you least expect it, you'll take a bit full of red peppers, your eyes will water, and your sinuses will clear. Ah yes, you did order a spicy sandwich. And then the rest of the sandwich will be non-spicy and you'll go back to being confused, but also sort of relieved, because that felt like a near-death experience.

Quite an experience. But it's part of the charm.

Anyway, I'm a huge fan of this place. I love it when my lunch is cheaper than my coffee. (Although that may be a problem with the coffee... but that's another story) I probably eat there at least once a week. It's just so convenient and so close!"}
{"text":"Very amiable staff but with such care and in subtle measures. The smiles aren't always obvious and oddly gritty but their intentions are much softer. After our transaction we left the store. A woman comes out screaming. We didn't discern any of it. We followed her back into the store. The owner thought we forgot an item. Rather thoughtful."}
{"text":"If you've been to one Nguyen Huong, you've pretty much seen them all.  The design and setup are mostly identical, so if it ain't broken why fix it.  There are slight variations that is mainly due to the fact that this Vietnamese Sandwich Shop/Grocer has a different staff on-hand which makes this Banh Mi of mine more SPICY than the other Nguyen Huong I've been to.

I actually had a Lab-rat of a Friend which has never had Banh Mi so I introduced it thinking it's normal spicy until I heard the word \"SPICY\" coming out only a couple seconds into the bite.  I took my bite and it was indeed Heat-inducing of a Vietnamese Sandwich that was perfect for a cool December day in Toronto.

Still the same old over-crunchy rockhard of a Baguette that I don't like from this Nguyen Huong or any other of their many branches."}
{"text":"Only place I go for Vietnamese subs. The staff are pretty friendly. If you can't or don't want to handle the spice, let them know. I love that I can sub the Vietnamese sausages for the cold cuts ( or get both). Its oh so good"}
{"text":"We can here for a quick bite on Saturday. The place is essentially a grocery store and has no real seating. It's more of a grab and go kind of place. Their spicy cold cut bahn mi on top of the counter. For $2.50, it's great value. We ended up splitting the banh mi in half and I ended up with the more spicier side so just beware of that. The spicy one does have a kick to it. I'd definitely grab another one in the future if I do get the chance."}
{"text":"I don't know a thing about Vietnamese food so forgive me while I fumble through this review. I don't eat a lot of meat that I don't understand (too long as a vegetarian) so I've only had the tofu banh mi out of the sandwiches but it was very nice and dirt cheap.

What I really want to talk about is some kind of noodle stuff in the prepared section. It's got noodles and carrots and cilantro and comes with crushed nuts and some kind of sweet sauce. I don't really know what it is but I would guess mi chay. Anyway, I crave it day and night. I tried it the second day after I moved to Toronto and I still need it once a week. Luckily, it's only $3.50. The tray is pretty huge and I tell myself it will do two meals but then I get shovelling it into my face and it only lasts for one because I'm greedy. I don't even know how to eat it. My roommate heats it and eats it with chopsticks. I mow own right out of the package with a fork. However you choose to devour it you won't regret it. There are spring rolls that are pretty good too but that's 3.50 I could spend buying more noodles so I don't bother with those often.

Anyway, I have to stop typing and get back to eating these noodles."}
{"text":"Oh Banh Mi Yellow Sign.  I love your banh mi, but you need to step up the variety and quality on your other goods.  Ima-breaka-breaka down!

+++PROS+++
1. Top quality banh mi, really consistent, likely the best in Toronto!
2. Bread keeps better than it's neighbor at Banh Mi Green Sign (especially if toaster oven'ing it the day after)
3. Nem Nuong (Vietnamese sausage) is actually in sausage form, not that flat garbage you sometimes see
4. They have that deep fried bean/shrimp muffin thing (excellent crispy served with fish sauce!), a rarity

---CONS---
1. Less variety than its neighbor
2. Portion sizes (non-banh mi) is visibly smaller
3. Busier than next door
4. No spots to eat in store
5. No hot foods

So really, this place is quite good.  I give the edge to it's neighbor because of the cons of this place, particularly the variety.   In reality though, I'd go to 'Yellow' for banh mi then walk over to 'Green' for everything else.

A TOONIE & A LOONIE RECOMMENDATION: stick with their banh mi ($1.75-$2.25)"}
{"text":"Large assorted cold cut is definitely a great buy, at a price of 3 dollars, fills you right up for lunch. 

One thing that is definitely nice, is if you go later into the day, a lot of their plated dishes will be discounted a decent amount. usually goes from 4 to 5 dollars down to 2 to 3 dollars."}
{"text":"Can not believe it's only $3.5 for a large and seriously awesome bah mi. Can not believe this is the first time I've been here, feel like my life in Toronto has been wasted. Deff will go back or try their uptown locations!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent banh mi sandwiches. Tried multiple types and have never been disappointed. Super inexpensive, fresh, quality ingredients. Also, make sure you check out the packages of other foods in the side coolers. The rice and egg lunch was delicious, as was the pork chop and rice. They may look a little odd but take a chance and pick one up. You will not be disappointed. Amazing food at very reasonable (in fact down right cheap!) prices."}
{"text":"This is a get-what-you-want and leave place. Usually in the form of a bahn mi sandwich, but they also offer a variety of other foods. You get your sandwich (I think this place offers the cheapest ones in the immediate area), pay, and leave. I rarely need to be in there for more than 3-5 minutes.

Customer service isn't super kind or friendly. You just get what you want, no nonsense. Perfect for what it says it does, no frills. $2.75 for a good meal is a steal."}
{"text":"My friend recently clarified for me, there are two Bhan Mi restaurants right beside eachother. One is better than the other....

I went to the less tasty Bhan Mi my first time (green sign). My tofu Bhan Mi was so bland. I was stuck having not eaten all day and starving, so I stuffed it down. Blah, just so darn bland...

I mentioned to my friend my tasteless Bhan Mi experience. She explained there are two right beside eachother, and to head to Bhan Mi Nguyen Huong (yellow sign!) next time.

She was indeed correct. My lemongrass tofu sub at Nuguyen was excellent!!! I will return for more tasty subs. At only $2 a sub, its a deal.

They also have fresh rolls, noodles and other meal options at incredibly affordable prices."}
{"text":"It's really a Nguyen-Nguyen if you come to this place. The sandwiches are delicious, and they're also insanely cheap, like me. They certainly are, well, Huong.

What to get: Banh Mi
What else: Banh You Too

They pre-make a ton of Banh Mi sandwiches, which are the cold kind with Vietnamese lunch meat on French bread, with pickled carrots and cilantro (coriander) and cucumbers and jalapenos and such. Amazingly, they charge under $3 Canadian.

Usually I don't enjoy the cold lunch meat Banh Mi (I prefer the hot BBQ pork kind, if it's done well), but these actually tasted fantastic. The flaky bread and veggies and peppers were the star and the centerpiece which is how I like it.

In a sandwich I mean. I'm not talking about \"how I like it\" in a rude or inappropriate sense, I'm not sure why your mind would immediately go there and you should probably have a word with yourself. I'm just not like that.

Nguyen Huong is being \"huong\" out to dry by its rival, Banh Mi Boys over near the CN Tower. The latter is a bit better and more fancy but more than twice the price. Sort of like my brother, versus me. They're calling the battle between the two, the \"Nguyen Huong Feud.\""}
{"text":"This place is the OG place for banh mi and they never ever ever ever disappoint! I had memories of going there as a kid to get my weekly banh mi with my grandparents so I've always had a soft spot for Nguyen Hoang. If you're ever stumped for where to eat for lunch, or if you want something cheap and filling, Nguyen Hoang is the place for you! I also recommend stocking up on some of these sandwiches too - not only are they excellent for quick lunches but they are also good for breakfasts, hangovers, picnics, long car rides, etc. Nguyen Hoang, you're the real MVP. You rock, never change!"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, and tasty! I always get a few different sandwiches when I stop by, as they make for simple but yummy lunches. 

I particularly enjoy the Vietnamese sausage, and the bbq pork. 

They also sell the pate, and various other items. Great value!"}
{"text":"My go to for take out comfort food. It can get a little tricky ordering if you're not familiar with vietnamese food or banh mi. The staple is banh mi cha lua. I am a purist, so not a fan of any the other variations they have. 

If you are already there it is worth trying the spring rolls, banh gio (sticky rice with ground pork and mushroom filling) and the banh cong (essentially a savoury deep fried mung bean muffin with a prawn on top). T

The banh cuon is not too bad. I occasionally stare at the che lovingly, but never get it."}
{"text":"Cold cuts small:$2.50 and large $3  
BBQ chicken and pork: one size, $4
There are more varieties to choose from.
Vegan option: Lemongrass tofu also $2.50 for small and $3 for large
No tax, cash only

Cold cuts are already prepared so you can get your bahn mi literally in less than a minute.
Spicy ones have red chili inside which can be quite spicy for some people. Small one has two different types of cold cut and pate whereas the large one has three different kinds and pate plus it is a bit bigger.They also sell premade spring rolls (three for $4), cold noodle salads, drinks, and desserts etc. All very cheap.

A good place for a quick snack or meal. If you are in the area, give it a try! No seating available in the store, so you have to find somewhere outside to eat or take it home."}
{"text":"They have the best sandwiches for the price. You really can't beat it when you're on a budget."}
{"text":"Fond memories of fat kid joy whenever I passed by this store! I would go in & buy me 2  bánh mì each time.

$2.50 bánh mì or a $5.61 sub from chain sandwich store?  2  bánh mì every time!

There are also rice noodle rolls, & chè dau (dessert). 

I left store with 4 large viet subs (bánh mì) for 10 dollars. But not before  seeing a hobo pander the cash lady for free food.

Do stop by for their most authentic bánh mì."}
{"text":"I remember coming to this Chinatown fixture as a kid with my family every weekend, and it continues to be the only place in downtown Toronto where you can buy prepared Vietnamese food. This place is known for their banh mi sandwiches, which are great, but I encourage you all to try their other delights! 

For $33 I was able to get two grocery bags full of meals for the week - including fresh banh mi sandwiches, goi cuon (rice paper rolls), vermicelli dishes with spiced pork, and banh da lon (steamed pandan and mung bean deserts). They have so many other delicious things too - I recommend the banana cake, tri-coloured che dessert (in the fridge), banh bo nuong (green sponge cake thingie), banana leaf-wrapped skinny sausages at the cash register, and radish cake omelette.

The only downside is they only accept cash."}
{"text":"I came here to grab lunch and a few Viet sausages one day. It never fails to impress me. Their pricing is so competitive and the food made fresh daily. They always lower their price at the end of the day to sell everything out. I also have a sharp pallet and can taste if something is old. This place is pretty reliable to grab a quick, fairly healthy, and cheap bite."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with Banh Mi & Che Cali (next door)...this is the better Banh mi shop.  It used to be much cheaper ($1 CAD) but still not bad at $2CAD a pop (compared to NYC anyways).  I also like their Pate biscuit."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!! This is my default go to place when I'm too lazy to make dinner (i.e. most of the time).  I love their bahn mi - my favorite is their non-spicy (forewarning they aren't kidding when they say spicy) assorted meat sandwhich (i.e. their most popular sandwich) and their meat ball one.  Both are only $2 each - I missed the days when they were only $1 each.

Other must-tries include their stir fried rice cakes with egg - they make it fresh in the store (if you are lucky enough to get there when they are making it at the stove top by their window - that's the best).  I also like their lemon grass pork chop prepared meal. It comes with a thinly sliced pork chop, rice, egg quiche, pork skin pieces and pickled carrots and white radish.  It's more than enough for a meal.

Their often sold-out pork pate buns are amazing - just eat them cold or bring them home and heat them in your toaster oven.  Their fried sticky rice (they three different kinds) hits the spot each and every time.  They also sell all the cold cuts they use for their sandwiches.  They make great sandwich meats for those times you are sick of the roast beef or roasted turkey breasts you get from the grocery stores.  

Amazing place, as evident by the huge swarms of customers at any given time of the day (especially weekends)!"}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars, but I have nothing to compare it to. I know there are 3 bahn mi stores on this dundas/spadina corner, but this is the first one I have been to and I can't get myself to go to another. 

I've tried the lemongrass tofu, shredded chicken, bbq pork & their cold cuts sandwich. They're all delicious - the tofu one surprisingly so. 

I believe they speak Cantonese there, as well as Vietnamese. I'm a second generation Chinese, so I like to speak English as to not embarrass myself. Here is how you order:
you: one tofu and one chicken please (or whatever it is you want)
the lady behind the counter: *repeats your order back.* spicy?
you: YES. 

I'm always on the look out for ways to nom nom nom for under $5. This qualifies beautifully."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want classic Banh Mi at an affordable price. I remember coming here as a kid, this place has been around for a very long time! 

This chain offers a variety of banh mi sandwiches and other vietnamese snacks. They have food that is wrapped and ready to go such as spring rolls and meatballs. They also sell other items including vietnamese sausages and desserts. 

The service can be a hit or miss. The people working here tend to rush you during peak hours. They expect you to know what you want when you enter so they can move the line fast. This is why I can't give them a five-star rating because I did experience some rude service here multiple times. Overall, this place is a great place to grab quick food but don't expect any good service."}
{"text":"i might be a little bias towards this place since its where i SORT OF fell head over heels for my bf when we were still little high school students w no money . but looking at all the reviews & ratings, probably not .

we were on a date, exploring chinatown . as we walked by this place, he asks me if ive ever had a viet sub before . when i shake my head, he runs in and grabs 3 of these sandwiches . back then they were $1.25 ? $1.50 ? anyways . one for me, one for him, and one for the homeless man that we walked by earlier . gah . that made me weak in the knees . AND introducing me to this delicious cheapo sandwich that i wish i can have everyday ? hes a keeper . :)

as far as the sandwiches go, this is my fav place to get them in toronto . their spicy is extra spicy . like as in teary, tongue hurting spicy . i love it . if youre in a mood for a sandwich/sub and your tastebuds are in a need for something new, get this . i love the pickled carrots & raddishes in it . OH NOO, i love the cilantro more ! i love love LOVE cilantro . fortunately, my bf HATES cilantro . he picks them out from his and gives them all to me . yay . we're so perfect together, my bf, viet subs & i . :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places in Toronto. It is a mandatory eat, I even bring a few back to Ohio. The BBQ pork is the FCUKing bomb. Spicy chili peppers are the best. The spring rolls are the bomb.I Want to try the eggs and potatoes one day. Have not been to TO in a year or so : ( I so miss this place. The sandwich Pequenos Kebleros (Keebler Elves) make everything fresh and try to make you really happy. I customize my sandwich and they tell me it 25 or 50 cents more, like that would dissuade me. I think if I lived in TO this could be almost a daily thing as it is probably cheaper than cooking!"}
{"text":"This place can get pretty nuts, or maybe that's Toronto's Chinatown in general. I might have had some gripes with the language barrier but I was lucky enough to have my Vietnamese girlfriend/interpreter by my side, so that made the whole process a lot smoother.

Banh Mi will run you for about $2-$3 depending on the kind you get. I made out with 9 sandwiches to take back with me across the border: 4 traditional, 3 sausage, and 2 BBQ pork, all for $20. I really wanted to try the meatball but they were out of stock, which is a common \"problem\" here (when I tried the night before, they were about 10 sandwiches away from being cleaned out completely). Being that high in demand is a good kind of problem, of course.

The sandwiches are delicious. Not the best banh mi I've ever had, but for the quantity, quality, and price, you can't beat it. Now I know why I see hordes are constantly coming out of the shop with huge bags in each hand.

They offer a ton of other goodies as well. Prepackaged (but fresh) meals, desserts, baked goods, etc. I tried the banh bao (steamed pork bun), and I might have to stock up on those next time as well since I have yet to find any like it in Cleveland.

Nguyen Huong is legit."}
{"text":"The cheapest banh mi I've ever had in North America! This place is on par with the ones in Orange County, CA aka. Little Saigon and the mecca of Vietnamese food in America. 

I stumbled upon this place on my second visit to Toronto.  I was determined to find some tasty Vietnamese food that included pho and banh mi because I had heard tons of great reviews about it.  I got the banh mi dac biet (\"the special\").  They packed it with meat, cilantro, jalapenos, pickled radish & carrots, and tons of mayo and pate (my favorite part!).  The first bite of my sandwich was like a taste of heaven... it was that good! 

In addition to the banh mi, they sell other prepared Vietnamese food.  I got some nem (cured meat). Tasted just like my grandma used to make them when I was a kid."}
{"text":"There's two banh mi places side by side. This place and \"Che Cali\" over to the left. I tried both in a head to head and Nguyen Huong came out on top. 

Signage is all in Vietnamese and you'll find yourself a bit out of your comfort zone upon walking in. Do the white guy thing and start flapping your arms around, singing something from Glibert & Sullivan, and eventually you'll be gently guided to the sandwich counter on the North side of the store.

Best I can figure there's a small and large sandwich. You can have it spicy or mild. I tried the mild pork large. $2.25 with tax. Those into a footlong at Subway might want to order two... bringing you in at $4.50.

Yeah. $4.50. Two street dogs will run you $5-$6 in Toronto. 

There's no seating, as others have noted, but you could walk south to one of the Chinese almost-malls and munch it there. Or go east on Dundas to the Villiage on the Grange and mow it in their foodcourt."}
{"text":"A must visit whenever you're in Chinatown! It's a small shop, that sells a variety of Made to Order Banh Mi's, Deep Fried foods, rice rolls and desserts. It won't put a dent in your pocket and everything is fresh, especially the meat and veggies. The ladies yell out a bunch of orders out in Vietnamese which really shows how authentic this place is. Yes the floors are sticky, but you're in and out of there in less than 5 minutes max cause the service is super fast!"}
{"text":"I remember when there used to be four banh mi places in chinatown.  Now it's just down to two (I don't count the one on Dundas west of Bathurst because the appearence of the food doesn't seem to circulate).

Don't get me wrong, for $2 you get a nice banh mi, if only there were more toppings.  My preference is very basic, one slice of mysterious pale colored meat and load the veggies.  No liver paste, no soy sauce, and none of those other meats.  Everytime I ask if I can have heavy veggies instead and I never get extra.  You would think that by reducing the meat they'd give you more veggies on request.  Nope, not here.

On an interesting note, when I ask if I can get one slice of meat across, they tell me \"It's the same price\", despite my request for more veggies I am denied again...

Ordering a veggie sub won't net you much veggies again either.  Listen...I'm just trying to be reasonable.  I've even compared to a veggie banh mi and a regular banh mi and the serving is almost the same.  Even offering to pay extra they don't give you much....sigh....

Would give more stars if they won't so cheap on toppings.  C'mon, veggies are more cheaper than meat!  Give me veggies!!!"}
{"text":"Vietnamese sandwiches. Taste, value, you know what to expect; and if it's a fast in and out then you can't ask for more. I use to get their sandwiches from T&T. Love 'em!"}
{"text":"I am glad this place is so close to my work. It's my go to place when I forget my lunch at home. You get what you pay for. A large banh mi costs just $2.75 tax in! The chicken ones are $3.50. The banh mi tastes great with the spicy sauce. They put tonnes of carrots, cucumbers and cilantro. They meat isn't fresh but really at this price point I am not complaining. If you want to have the best banh mi head over to banh mi boys but also be ready to pay up atleast 2x the price. They have a variety of pre-packaged meals as well for a reasonable price. This is probably the cheapest lunch you can score in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I've had one thing and one thing only from this awesome Vietnamese Submarine sandwich shop located on Dundas, and it was pure awesomeness. 

I'm beginning to think that the Vietnamese are set on world food domination for all categories, because pho is by far my favorite meal in the entire world, at any time, but now along come these incredibly fresh, tasty and AFFORDABLE sandwich's, throwing yet another tasty weapon into the arsenal that is Vietnamese cuisine!  

I have had a colleague bring me these, so I can't even tell you what kind I got, but whatever it was, it was great. The bread was so fresh I'd swear it had barely enough time to cool before I ate it. The filling was a mortadella like cold cut, with a pastrami like cold cut, a base of pate and a center of spicy carrots. Apparently all of this costs something around $3-4. It's very spicy, incredibly flavorful and unbelievably affordable. 

Go, NOW!"}
{"text":"Still excellent and to clarify Nguyen Huong's workers are Chinese/Vietnamese so they speak both Cantonese and Vietnamese. Anyways, the banh mi price has gone a bit since my last visit but of course it didn't stop me from getting my fav. banh mi tap cam and those shrimp toast/cake/muffins lol can't remember what they're called in Viet XD I'm surprised that they added a che bar too. Sweet :) gonna give that a try :)"}
{"text":"RANDOM STORY:  The first time I came here (picked this over their neighbour as it seems more consistently busy) - a very drunk man with a wild beard was opening and devouring their pre-packaged food and knocking over their displays.  Instead of ordering my banh mi, we were asked to speak to the 911 operator to explain what was happening and provide the address.  I took this as a sign that I wasn't getting any banh mi today and we left.

So, this place seems to be a staple in the GTA.  I'm a banh mi fiend - chances are I've had more banh mi that you'll ever have... or anyone that you know.  I was raised off this stuff.  I take banh mi seriously - allow me to drop some science:

MATERIALS:
 - $2.50 (tax included) in cash only
 - large house special/cold cuts banh mi (a.k.a. Vietnamese submarine sandwich).

BREAD:  Rock hard bread - it was never toasted and I was never asked if I wanted it toasted.  Like most ghetto-licious Vietnamese joints, I was only asked, \"You want spicy?\"... there is only one appropriate answer to this.  The bread is huge and very chewy.  If you are used to crunchy, flaky baguettes, this is not the banh mi for you.  It actually made my jaw a bit sore after eating.

PATE: I could only detect a slight smear of pate.  Considering the price, I wasn't surprised they skimped on this.

FILLING: Plenty of veggies (daikon, carrots and cilantro) and surprisingly plentiful meat cuts.  The filling was solid - unfortunately, the bread really detracted from the fillings.

CONCLUSION:  Overall, this place is a bargain.  It's $2 for a small and $2.50 for a large.  If it wasn't for the bread, I would love this place.  Can't go wrong for a quick and cheap lunch.  But far from my favourite."}
{"text":"fave in the GTA, love their assorted sandwiches and always get the large size bread (i find the long skinny ones they use for large size sandwiches are crunchier). the ladies that work here are always super kind and accommodating, they always agree to separate veggies and chillies for me. i've been going here since i wa a skid, best most legit viet sub in the city"}
{"text":"This is THE place to go if you want a cheap lunch or if you have no motivation to cook dinner.

I got a small assorted cold cut sandwich, handed over a toonie and a quarter and was out the door. The bread wasn't rock hard, the pickled veggies tasted pretty fresh (as fresh as they can get for a $2.25 sandwich anyways) and it had a nice little kick to it because I asked for it spicy. 

Just a little gripe: there was too much mayo for my liking but overall, it was still a solid sammy.

I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I visit this place every single time I'm in Toronto.  And sometimes on a daily basis, then.

It is SO worth it, not just for the sandwiches but also for the price.
$3.50 for a huge Bhan Mi (assorted, spicy) stuffed with fresh ingredients and lightening-speed service?  Yes, please!

Ladies behind the counter are not the most personable (but that's more due to the speed they are trying to work at to accommodate the line-up), but the cashier makes you feel like they are grateful for your business.  

Lots of other offerings and ready-made lunches there as well....haven't tried any of them though since (ashamedly) I am not quite sure what they are and the language barrier can sometimes make it difficult to inquire.  Once in a while I get lucky and run into someone also shopping there who is more familiar with Vietnamese cuisine and approaches me when I'm standing there staring at something obviously trying to figure out what it is."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is well known for their cheap Vietnamese sandwiches, which are $2.5 for a small and $3 for a large. 

You first choose the type of meat you want, and then they will fill it up with favoured, shredded carrots, parsley, and sauces. You can request to not add in the hot sauce because according to my friend who got hers with it, it's VERY spicy. 

I got mine with shredded pork skin and it tasted really good. The small size was enough for lunch. Would definitely come again for the cheap food!"}
{"text":"My only real experience with banh mi continues to be Banh Mi Boys, which pretty much blew me away right when they opened their first location. Rapid expansion has dulled the brand considerably, so I haven't eaten a banh mi in quite some time.

I just happened to be wandering through Chinatown when I noticed a sign for cheap banh mi sandwiches here, so I stopped inside and was quickly asked if I needed any help. A quick perusal of the sandwich menu led me to select B.B.Q. Chicken, and I asked for it extra spicy.

This is a damn fine sandwich. The ingredients all work beautifully together and there were no bites that seemed to be lacking components. The chicken was tasty and plentiful, and I certainly got the spice that I had asked for. It's an extremely generous portion, too.

All that for $4, tax included! An incredible deal, undoubtedly. I'll definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"For the cheaper end of the Banh Mi spectrum, Nguyen Huong makes the best authentic Vietnamese sandwiches in Toronto! Get a stick of cha lua (Vietnamese pork) while you're at it. I love this place and swear by it."}
{"text":"Great place in Chinatown to get banh mi! Just make sure you know what you want as it is really crazy in there and hectic! The ladies behind the counter will harass you until you move along!

Lots of great prepacked food as well, if the sandwich isn't your thing!"}
{"text":"Still a great place to get banh mi. You can get one for $3. Getting two will be enough to make you full . Make sure to check out other items behind the counter."}
{"text":"triumphant feeling
spending less than five dollars
for a filling sub

don't come expecting
culinary excellence

i guess i digress

the lemongrass sausage too
everything's prob' good"}
{"text":"Best banh mis in the city! This place has been around forever, and everything is still the same and super awesome! The place is a little chaotic inside, with everything from the sandwiches, prepared meals, desserts and friend snacks. 

To place an order, you have to either get to the till, or one of the ladies behind the counter will directly ask you what you want before you get to the till. The ladies behind the counter are always making sandwiches, and English is a little more limited in the shop. 

The sandwiches and desserts are fried things are the only thing's I've tried, but they are all delicious, and fresh! I always stop by this shop when I'm in Chinatown/Kensington for a sandwich or two!"}
{"text":"Here is review #100 for 2018! I have had a lot of travel and was trying to make #100 something in my hometown but on a recent work visit to Toronto, this place really spoke to me. 

I found it initially odd since it is a Vietnamese food shop in a predominant Chinatown. What drew me in was the signage outside indicating fresh banh mi. It is on a busy street with only a few street meters around so good luck with that. There is a municipal parking garage a few blocks away as a best bet. 

Walking in I noticed several different Vietnamese foods best characterized as carry out snacks such as fresh, large stuffed buns, drinks, etc. but I barely noticed them because of the steam counter with several people behind it building banh mi's. 

What stands out here are that they make it in front of you, they are really affordable (only 40 cents more separates a small from a large) and they have a lot of ingredients that I have not seen in other banh mi shops such as sardines, several kinds of sausages, and a vegetarian option. Ok first the Canadian exchange rate is pretty good for Americans so the cost of the banh mi is about a US dollar less than what I am used to. Second, an upgrade to a large sandwich is only about 25 cents American. For that, I'm all in! 

The banh mi was awesome. Crusty bread with pillow soft insides, butter and pate' nuanced in the background and if you order it spicy, there are a few extra hot peppers snuck in. Add a gratuitous egg and it is off the hook good and plenty messy!

If I lived in Toronto, I would be an addict and this would be my abusable product. In fact just thinking about it makes me need a little private time!  Just kidding but if you are ever in he Toronto Chinatown area, you gotta give it a try!"}
{"text":"Just say large, spicy, and give them ten quarters.  A tasty treat.

This place can be daunting to new comers because you need to know what you're doing, and then get on out.  There's no time to look around, browse, or figure it out.

go in, say your piece, pay, and leave - enjoying a most delicious sandwich.  No trip to China Town is complete without a Bahn Mi here."}
{"text":"Love this place - so grungy, so cheap. Their bahn mi is only $2 for a regular, and $2.50 for a bit larger one. The default option is a selection of cold cuts, with pickled veggies (carrots and cucumbers), pâté, mayo, and cilantro. If you ask for the spicy option, then they also stuff your sandwich with this super spicy sliced red peppers. The BBQ pork and other options than the basic cold cut are a little more expensive: from what I remember it was a little around $3.75, and it gets a nice dose of that vietnamese BBQ sauce. 

Bread is very crusty and airy - it's super flaky and gets all over the place when you eat. Sometimes they'll try to give you a sandwich that's pre made - especially if it's busy, but I always ask them to make me a new one. No place to sit - you buy a sandwich and leave. 

Definitely get the sense that this place isn't super sanitary - when I first got the pork BBQ sandwich I thought the meat was raw. I think it's smoked or something but it looks pretty sketchy, but YOLO. Have been eating here for the past month, and still alive, so good enough for me!

Highly recommended for a quick, cheap and delicious meal."}
{"text":"This place is Banh Mi central. This store has been around for ever and it's easy to see why. Their sandwiches are  my go-to on those days that I don't have time to cook but don't want to spend a lot of money eating out. Their Banh Mi are just amazing. The bread is crispy on the outside; there are lots of cold cut slices in the middle along with pickled radishes, carrot, cucumber, and fresh cilantro. The pate and mayo adds the fattiness and flavor to otherwise very simple sandwich. For $3.50, it's hard to find anything better and more filling. (yes, their prices went up a bit :S)"}
{"text":"Probably the best place in the city for a cheap, tasty, addictive Banh Mi sandwich. 

Went on a lark based on the overwhelmingly positive Yelp reviews and got myself a BBQ (although not hot) Pork Banh Mi that came in a substantial baguette roll with carrots, cucumber, some sort of hoisin/sweet sauce and mayo. Suffice to say, my tastebuds and wallet were so satisfied I went back the next three days in a row.

The Tofu and Lemongrass Banh Mi is a splendid vegetarian option too! They also have great specials on packaged meals with rice and shrimp or pork but I'm looking forward to trying some of their vietnamese rice paper rolls next time.

Definitely now one of my go-to spots for a quick snack on Spadina."}
{"text":"Perfect car ride snack during my road trip!

Located in Chinatown. Cash only. 

The building your sandwich in front of you right after your order.

Assorted Cold Cut Sandwich, large - $3 - Good mix of viet deli meat. Huge sandwich and so cheap compared to back home. 

BBQ Pork Sandwich, large - $3.75 - Well seasoned pork. Worked well with the pickled veggies.

Eggroll - $1.25 - Big eggroll. Pork and veggies were good. Pricey  for an eggroll even after the US conversion rate.

Viet Coffee - $2 - Terrible! They use granulated sugar and crappy coffee to make this. Nothing was good about this at all. Would have been a 4 if this coffee did not suck so much!"}
{"text":"I've been addicted to their Banh MI which I pick up from t&t... I think theyre the same because they looked the exact same and had the same packaging. Only difference was the price. T&t is $1.50 more plus tax.
At this location, I was delighted to see so many options!!! I choose the bbq chicken. I got it in a paper bag but promptly put it in my own sandwich bag. Ate it the next day and it was fantastic. I was expecting a bbq pork taste but the bbq sauce was like a sweet soy sauce flavour. The spicy was a perfect amount. I loved the cucumbers... I've already decided to come back next week to try the shrimp cake and bother flavour of Banh MI. YUMMY!! A must try for anyone."}
{"text":"Looks chaotic in there but great local stop in Chinatown. I got the regular pork sandwich and I liked it. The bread was a bit stale but props to them for making their own Bread. They have an assortment of cold drinks and prepackaged food which I didn't try but would have loved to! I'd go again to try everything they have! similar to saigon bakery in New York."}
{"text":"Nguyen Huong! my favourite vendor of 43 mystery meat sandwiches!
Great 'banh' delicious butter, carrots, cilantro, the mystery deli and cheap prices.
How could you beat that?
You cannot.
Just one criticism: why oh why do you have to put all the spice in one place? Why is all the spice concentrated on one spot? When you say 'yes' to spicy and they add the spice instead of their spreading the spice around they just put it all on one single spot.
Result: 4 bites of no spice whetehr you order, deli, tofu, lemongrass, sausage or whatever and 1 bite of explosion in your mouth/headache/tongue going numb.

Still, compared to Mr Sub or Subway this is cheaper, more fresh, healthier and more delicious... Vietnamese buns are the best."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. 

Its cheap. Its good. Its filling. How can you complain when $2.25 gets you a meal. This is what a banh mi should taste like. The baguette is great and I love the cold cuts. Whenever I go to Spadina, this is my first stop. 

If you bring it home and warm it up in the oven for the bread to be warm and crispy.  IT IS DIVINE. Just remember to take the veggies out before putting it in the oven. What can I say, I love my banh mi."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! this has probably the best tasting sandwich, not just a viet sandwich, I've ever tasted, and it tastes perfect every time. 

It used to cost a little cheaper (1.50, i think), and only had one size, but they raised the price and has a large and small sizes now. the large costs about $2.50 and small $2.00. I usually get the large because i like to eat half and save the other half for when i get home. The combination of meat and pickled carrots and radishes and whatever else they put into that sub is delicious. I personally prefer the non-spicy ones, and since it's less in demand, they'll make it on the spot for you, and I don't mind waiting a little. I personally find that the spiciness takes away from the flavour that's uniquely in a bánh mì, but that's just me :D. 

If you've never been to this place, just give it a try! For $2.50, you won't lose much even if you don't like it."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite banh mi shop. The assorted meats sandwich is the best sandwich I've had in a while. All the ingredients work very well together, very crisp vegis and very creamy meat sauce. The price is very cheap at $3.50 for a large banh mi. The shop might look a bit dirty and run down but that definitely isn't reflective of the food. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Tried the Tofu, grilled pork and chicken Banh mi. $2-3 each. All decent for banh mi, but I've certainly had better and cheaper."}
{"text":"You simply can't compare banh mi boys to this. Banh mi boys is like a VC-backed fast food shop and Nguyen Huong is an authentic mom and pop store. The pre-packed cold cut meat sandwich is simply the best value out of all its peers whether you group them in the deli sandwich category or the banh mi category. 

It's simply amazing and only ~$2.50."}
{"text":"First banh mi I ever had was at Nguyen Huong.  I had no idea how to order or what was in it.  Thankfully the woman behind the counter realized I was drowning and handed me a sandwich so I could leave with my dignity intact.

The roll, as I have come to know, was perfect.  Flaky on the outside and soft as can be on the inside.  Crumbs littered my shirt after each bite.  The mystery meat pate was as good as any I've had since.  Still the most balanced banh mi I've ever had.  If I make it back I would like to try the bbq pork version.

And for $1.75 it is a pretty unbeatable value."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite banh mi in the city for 4 years but I noticed a slight decrease in the amount of filling they use in the sandwiches now. This is the only reason why I strayed and gave 4 stars instead of 5. 
In addition, it can be confusing when you're standing respectfully in line and there are elderly Asians barging right in front of you and shouting their orders in a language you don't speak. 
Still despite all this, it's the best place for a cheap lunch and there's nothing like walking through Kensington Market with a Viet sandwich in your hand."}
{"text":"Consistently good.  Things move quickly in this place so be prepared to know what you want to order.  Outside of LA (or Vietnam), this is the best banh mi you'll get in Toronto.  Generally I order the chicken or the pork.  There is a man who has sesame balls (sweet) for sale as well.  They also offer the fresh spring rolls (i.e. not fried) with salad ingredients and nice, fresh, flavourful cilantro inside with the fish and soy dipping sauce.  Other Vietnamese items for sale for take out (pre-packaged).  Has never let me down.  And this is a good deal dollar$ wi$e."}
{"text":"The Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwiches) here are really delicious. It's cheap as well! For your first time here, I would either go for the meatball or the assorted banh mi. The service, however, is just 'OK', mostly because of the language barrier. So, be sure to make it clear what you want. They have messed up my order on a couple of occasions. Lastly, be sure to bring cash. No debit/credit accepted."}
{"text":"Eh, not bad for mass production the banh mi! Quick in and out grub. The ladies are rude and like to rush when they busy. When it's a slow time they want to be best friends lol"}
{"text":"The price went up and the quality when down.  Each sandwich is now packed full of butter, cheaper cuts of meat and pickled carrots... Off to find a new favourite!"}
{"text":"If you love banh mi, then this is where to get em. The food is fresh and super cheap, I can't wait to find an excuse to pick up the spicy large banh mi whenever I'm in Chinatown!!"}
{"text":"Wanna eat an awesome sandwich for less than five bucks? Then go to this place! 

It's great, and you honestly cannot beat the prices. Also, pretty good location, as it's near the streetcar line, and many other destinations."}
{"text":"Here's the summary:

The price? Amazing. You can be filled up in mere minutes (or however long it takes to stuff your face) for under 5$.

The service? Uhm... well it's quick. It's certainly not friendly.

The freshness? As long as you grab food earlier in the day you should be fine.

So why two stars? Because after travelling around the world and having my last upset stomach be brought on by a tiny village in remote Mexico, I'd like to think I have a tough stomach. So having to pray to the porcelain gods after eating food here for the second time wasn't terribly enjoyable. 

So while the meat may appeared cured, I think would only eat food here in the early part of the day."}
{"text":"SO MUCH LOVE FOR THIS PLACE!!! It's only $2.75 for a real decent viet sub and you get to choose from a variety of meat! It tastes good too 

They also have prepacked food incase you're too lazy to make your own meal and the staff are really quick so there's almost no wait time even there's quite a few people in the store."}
{"text":"You can't beat their just-made banh mi sandwiches on freshly baked baguette.

I've been coming here since I was a kid. I remember going in there and being told I could choose 1 or 2 treats while my parents ordered some of the traditional banh mi sandwiches. The Vietnamese subs were so great, still are great, and although they've raised their prices over the years, you can't beat it at $2.50 a pop. There are also other prepared foods in the refrigerator cases and Asian drinks and desserts too. The prepared foods are super great if you're looking for something different, cheap, and yummy. Lots of rice flour rolls, sticky rice, summer rolls, etc. You can't go wrong if you love Vietnamese food. The sweet treats are packed in the same styrofoam trays and plastic wrap, but the sticky green treats with yellow bean paste are not as I remember them as a kid, unfortunately. I've tried several times but they're just not as sweet, fresh, and soft as they used to be...Maybe I've just had bad luck and picked some not-so-fresh ones, but it's a little disappointing.

They also make their own \"che\" which is Vietnamese dessert. There are tons of different kinds of che but Nguyen Huong does them all very well. Additionally, in the drinks fridge, they sometimes do \"com ruou\" which translates to \"rice alcohol\". It's a different kind of che and it's white rice balls in a sweet and slightly alcoholic liquid. I don't know how they make it, but it tastes a little fermented and sweet...Try it if you're feeling adventurous! It's a bit of an acquired taste but still one of my favourite things to grab when it's available. There are tons of other things to take home too, like fresh Vietnamese sausages, Vietnamese cold cuts, savoury pastries...I dare you to try it all.

Can't go wrong here, I'll be coming back for years to come."}
{"text":"Must try: Banh mi

This place sells the most solid banh mi sandwiches I know. Once in a while I'll get the craving to come and grab them in bulk. I prefer the spicy version with the chilli but both types are very good. I feel like you can make your own as well, but I always just grab the already made ones because... They know best right??

I haven't tried anything else here so can't really comment. But everything in the store looks interesting. 

Remember to bring cash! But this is Chinatown so that's pretty much a given.

{"text":"Bahn Mi at bargain prices!

Every time me and the hubby shop at T&T, he picks up a Spicy Bahn Mi sandwich, and finally we decided to check out the address on the bag, and buy one direct.

Made fresh to order there are many choices, including the original, but all of them are incredibly cheap.

I still don't know how they can sell these for such low prices, but it doesn't matter, keeping hubby from getting hangry is worth the trip to Chinatown for a few Bahn Mi Sandwiches, while I drag him around the city running errands and doing shopping.  

This is not Bahn Mi Boys, no poutine, no bao, no frills, but the prices can't be beat.

That's it, it's the No Frills of Bahn Mi."}
{"text":"I came here after getting a banh mi at Banh Mi Ba Le on Dundas last week as it didn't fill me up. This place was packed. I ordered a spicy assorted cold cuts banh mi. I didn't like the bread as it was oval shaped & didn't taste as good as the one at Banh Mi Ba Le. Also I do realize with assorted cold cuts the texture is uaually a hit or mids but the chewiness of one of the cold cuts turned off. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The original Banh Mi Boys. No really, their parents own this place. Cheap, authentic Banh Mi with classic, Vietnamese ingredients. Did I mention the high average for one of these babies is a whooping $2.50? Yup!  

They also offer a number of different pre-made meals, with notables like sticky rice with Chinese sausage, Pork and mushroom steam rolls, and a variety of Vietnamese sausages. 

If you want eat where the locals eat, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Holy batman... can we say MOB (that's MOB, not FOB) on the weekends? http://tinyurl.com/5zo33h

Cheapest banh mi in N. America. CAN1.50 for the dac biet (in '06). DOLLAR FITTY? You out of your mind? And they use pate? Mind-boggling.

We chose this as a mini banh-mi comparo while in Toronto. The other contestant was the familiar Banh Mi & Che Cali joint http://www.yelp.ca/biz/cali-banh-mi-and-che-toronto-2 , appropriately right next door. What I loved about that Toronto banh mi tasting: Subway-esque assembly lines behind glass counters. Total transparency, immediate reaction & correction if they fubar your sammy.

And the winner? Nguyen Huong: \"chewy bread, tangy slices of sour pork, more pate, ad nausea\" (verbatim from post on http://www.lthforum.com )"}
{"text":"Cheap on-the-go Vietnamese foods! They have at least 3 people making the sandwiches, so If your in a hurry, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of the many great things about Toronto is that while New York only has a few places that offer Bahn Mi, there are at least a couple dozen in Toronto.  This is supposed to be one of the best and my experience supports that.  Read the other reviews for more detail but I particularly loved the Lemongrass Tofu that shows how soy foods can be better than meat.  An incredible deal."}
{"text":"The banh mi is good. This was the first time I tried it in Toronto and definitely was very good. Having a good lunch for $3 is totally worth it. Their bread is excellent. The only cons would be the store itself. I feel like it was smelly."}
{"text":"The best banh mi in the city. There are options on the menu, but I have never actually looked at it. I order one of two things: a large regular (for myself) or a large vegetarian spicy (for Mr. Vegetarian) which is made w tofu. All the textures are perfectly in alignment - crusty bread, crunchy vegetables, soft pate and cold cuts. It's a great sandwich, and they make them here and ship them to a bunch of other places in the city (including a few of their further-away outlets) so you might be eating their sandwiches and not even know. But the made-fresh are the best.

They will sell you a plain roll for a quarter, if you ask. 

The banana cake is great, with the little pot of coconut chutney. Also the fresh rolls are great, and the rice plates with sausage are always good - you can totally just eat them at room temperature for breakfast and be happy there. If you're an adventuresome eater, just try some things. They are pretty much all great.

I tend to go first thing in the morning and have banh mi breakfast. Downside to this is that lots of ingredients and finished sandwiches are coming in and out, so things are always chaotic. Upside is that they do much less retail business then, so if you go in the morning for a while eventually they will recognize you. When they start to recognize you, your sandwich improves (more vegetables, a nicer pate layer). 

Fun fact! The guys who own Banh Mi Boys are the sons of the couple who own this and the other Nguyen Huong Foods locations. Yum."}
{"text":"Had my first (of many I'm predicting) experience here today and both my appetite and my wallet are happily satisfied. 

Walking not knowing exactly what to expect, my friend and I were asked what we wanted right away. That's good I suppose, the service was very fast! We took a couple minutes to look at the menu and decided we both wanted the assorted cold cuts. At $2.75 for a large sandwich, you really can't find that anywhere else. I can't wait to try their other sandwiches and also their prepacked meals too! 

Tip: The ladies behind the counter also speak Canto!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese sandwich (Banh Mi) in the GTA!! I've also tried their other pre-packaged takeouts, including the vermicelli and they are all so delicious. 

They've raised the price from $1.50 to $1.75 to $2 now for the small size, but I still go all the time because i don't think i've ever had anything better..haha. 

Just go in, tell them small/large, spicy/non-spicy, and come back out with some delicious sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I remember a teenager I used to come here for lunch and a banh mi was a $1, sometimes I would feel sorry for the homeless man sitting in front of the shop and I would buy him one, I think he sits there on purpose so people would feed him a sandwich since it was cheap but that was a decade ago.

Today a sandwich is 2.50$ for a small and $3 for a large. $4 for premium sandwiches bbq pork and bbq chicken 

I normally get the cold cut one or the sausage one, it still had the same consistency from 10 years ago, I tried the bbq pork one today but didn't like it too much it lacked flavour. I'll stick with my cold cuts and sausage sandwich.

They have other Vietnamese items such as spring rolls and cold noodle dishes that are reasonably priced. 

A must try when in the Chinatown area."}
{"text":"Very very cheap place, really. You got sausage sandwich for 2.25$ - I ' m not sure about quality though...The bread could smell old sometimes, but overall I like the place for the prices"}
{"text":"This place is a dive in the truest sense of the word. Even Guy Fieri wouldn't be able to come up with a catchy euphemism to describe it. Located in the heart of Chinatown, this was just a snippet of the conversation I heard as I walked here: \"Sorry, I can't go to the liquor store for you now, I have to go get my methadone...maybe later?\" 

Anyway, back to business. I was seriously craving a banh mi and seeking an alternative to the ever popular Banh Mi Boys. Who wants to pay $6 for a banh mi when you can pay $2.50, man? 

I assumed that the proprietors would be Vietnamese, so I was shocked when my boyfriend stepped up to the counter and started barking orders in Cantonese. Apparently Nguyen Huong seems to be run by a gang of older Chinese women who just don't care about anything, including proper food handling techniques or customer service. But I think it would be even more shocking to walk out of this place saying, \"What a lovely restaurant, and such great service!\" 

The large vegetarian banh mi I had was tasty and filling, and for $2.50, who can complain? I asked for it spicy and they delivered, with the addition of hot chilis that seemed dead set on making me a full-on firebreather. My only concern was that they seem to just touch all the fillings willy-nilly without changing their gloves, so really strict vegetarians should probably avoid. I just look the other way -- ignorance is bliss! Ignorance is bliss! 

There's nowhere to sit inside, so you either have to bring it home, or eat your banh mi outside, leaving a trail of crumbs behind you. Note that they take cash only, so make sure you have a few loonies and toonies jingling around in your pockets before you come here."}
{"text":"In terms of price, location, and value, this place can't be beat for quick Vietnamese food.

There is no other place nearby that can beat their banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich). I've been coming here for over 20 years so I've seen the prices go from a dollar, to $2.50. The taste is just the same now as it was 20 years ago for their cold cut. Do not be afraid to come and try more of their many offerings though. The bot chien (fried flour with eggs and veggies) with the sauce is amazing. You can get it packaged or fresh. They also have summer rolls, Vietnamese sausage, noodles, rice, all for under $5!

Try some Vietnamese desserts while you're here too. They have some in the fridge or out depending on what it is. The multicoloured sticky rice is a favourite of mine."}
{"text":"Original viet sandwiches very quick and efficient i came there for a quick lunch break and it was very pleasant lots of sandwich options if your in the mood for some banh mi"}
{"text":"Good taste and portion sandwich for only $2.75. I like the assorted meat sandwich with spicy sauce which isn't very spicy at all."}
{"text":"The banh mi here is very tasty! For only $3, it's worth it. I only wish that they put more meat in the sub so it would taste even better. I had the shrimp cake that's displayed in the front but I didn't like it because it was very hard. Maybe because it's been sitting out for long and not right out of the oven so it's not as good. I also got some dessert here and it's pretty good. Overall, this place is good to grab some snack food on the go!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love. The banh mi here is delicious, and will only cost you $2-$4. While I love the standard banh mi, which contains an assortment of Vietnamese cold cuts, the ones with BBQ pork and chicken are also really good. 

There is also an assortment of ready to eat meals, and I got the goi cuon (summer rolls/wraps containing vermicelli, pork/shrimp, and lettuce), which is pretty decent for something that's been sitting in the fridge."}
{"text":"Nguyen Huong Food is known for extremely affordable banh mi for $2.50 each. 

If you look beyond the banh mi with pate, mystery meat, lettuces, pickled carrots, cilantro, grain; you will find a selection of meals to go! My favorite non-banh-mi on the go meal is the shrimp and sausage rice roll with a sweet and savory hoisin-plum sauce-hot sauce-tamarind dipping sauce for $3.50. It's the perfect meal for a hot summer day!

If you are feeling adventurous, complete your meal with a traditional Vietnamese dessert! The selection is endless! Be sure to ask the staff for their favorite! :)"}
{"text":"Their small banh mi is still a pretty decent size and most importantly it's delicious. I find it's really hard to get banh mi wrong though, which is probably the only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars. There's nothing that really makes this place different from any other banh mi place."}
{"text":"Cheap and legit banh mi... perfect for grabbing on the go if you want something cheap and filling. No idea what spreads they put in there.. looks kinda scary but tastes good and my stomach didn't have problems afterwards so safe to say it was allll good...
Wish there were more pickled veggies in there though and that the spiciness was spread evenly throughout the sandwich. 
Would def be back to try all the other items they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Another nostalgic place that I think of fondly when I am in Chinatown. OMG, their banh mi sandwiches are still ridiculously inexpensive! A small banh mi costs $2.75. Jeez, where can you get a meat sandwich for that price?? I swear inflation doesn't impact this place and it's only by pure volume....the three ladies behind the sandwich counter amaze me with their lightning fast sandwich assembly skills. The banh mi is not as good as I remembered but honestly, at that price, it's fine. 

there's also lots of traditional vietnamese snacks and meals to buy to go.

Service is fast and pretty friendly."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you're looking for a quick cheap Vietnamese bite.
The price of sandwiches have gone up over the last 10 years. It's $2.5 for a small sandwich now. The most popular one is the assorted cold cut. I love it with a bit of fresh chili pepper. Yummy! I usually pick up a few to go, eat one now and save some for lunch the next day. Pop it on the toaster oven for 5min, your sandwich is ready for lunch the next day 

I also like to pick up other items: cha lua (viet pork roll), spring rolls, and the dessert goodies (banana streamed cake with coconut dip, casava cake)"}
{"text":"In all likelihood, admittedly high in sodium. But fresh, cheap, and delicious. 
I'm currently working my way through every Banh Mi flavor available, so far the classics are still my favorite."}
{"text":"The Banh Mi here really got me by surprise! By the looks of it, it didn't seem much. But when I took a bite, I had to come back the next day before leaving Toronto. I got 12 big ones. Lol. Besides Banh Mi, this place offers a variety of snacks and to-go meals. The prices are really good for what you get compared to Montreal."}
{"text":"Hand down, best place to get an authentic Vietnamese banh mi. Delicious, fresh, and cheap sandwiches! I've gone here many, many times to buy food and have tried an assortment of Vietnamese foods (including their desserts and fresh rolls). Can't beat the price for what you get. The place is always busy and packed with people trying to buy their food and the assortment and diversity of Vietnamese cuisine is displayed once you enter the shop. Definitely a lot to try if you feel adventurous! Without a doubt I will be back for more in the future!"}
{"text":"Wow! What an AMAZING hidden gem! It's small Vietnamese shop in Kensington Market that's easy to miss, but make sure you don't. Go inside for lunch and order the most tasty bahn mi sandwich for just over $1 Canadian. Ask for a little extra meat and spice and it will be the best lunch you have in the city!"}
{"text":"For price to taste ratio, this will definitely be top of anyone's list. A large banh mi here goes for 3.00 CAD, no tax no nothing. The best any person can ask for. Their banh mis are really good too. Go to the counter and ask for a large spicy with everything and it will fulfill everything that you wanted. (Spicy is pretty spicy though) And pick up some summer rolles or whatever is around while you're there as everything is cheap."}
