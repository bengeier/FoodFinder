{"text":"Great pizza, strip mall ambiance, so nothing special, food makes up for it really a good pizza, see a lot of reviews relating to carry-out, eat in it is very good"}
{"text":"WOW!!! If you have any taste, these guys rock... My wife and I like to order delivery once in awhile and it never fails, COUSIN VINNY comes up everytime... The Rosemary Chicken Ravioli Alfredo is to die for. (Extra alfredo sauce) Sometimes they take a little longer than some but it is worth the wait. Give them a chance and you wont be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Found raw chicken on our daughter's pasta plate after she had already eaten most of it, and I had eaten her garlic bread that was sitting on top of it. Told the waitress and she didn't even offer to not charge us for our daughter's pasta that we of course couldn't finish. Praying we don't get food poisoning from it."}
{"text":"Under New Ownersip!!! Vinny's has always been a great place and with new energetic owners I'm sure there will be great things to come!! Looking forward to a great 2018 for this place."}
{"text":"My husband absolutely LOVES wings... All he could stomach was 2 wings because of the awful flavor. Will NOT be ordering again!!!"}
{"text":"Oh. Hey! Thought I couldnt get good food out here. Moved from NY.  Hey Vinny nice job...we loved the polite staff, quick delivery and hot food.  Oh hey cannoli's , caprese salad, calzone and tortolinni alfredo perfect!   My 6 year old daughter went nuts..my wife \" honey almost like you cooked, but now I don't have to clean the kitchen... Me, hey forgettabout it happy.   Great price Great food Great service  Ciao!"}
{"text":"Pizza was just OK.. Wings were boring.  We ordered a Vinny's special and the meet and toppings were great but the crust and sauce were just OK.. I was hoping for a lot better."}
{"text":"The pizza lacked taste and had way too much cheese. The crust was not cooked all the way through. It wasn't worth the money spent. The only bright spot were the wings which were cooked well and the sauce tasted good."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza we ever had. The service is excellent and the owners do everything possible to please the customers.  They make their own dough and all the sauces.  Extraordinary!!!"}
{"text":"This was our third dining experience at Cousin Vinnie's. The service and food were exceptional just like the previous visits. We have dined with different friends on each visit and they were all pleased with the food and service. Will definitely go back and would recommend Vinnie's to all!"}
{"text":"We just moved into our new house in Peoria so we thought we would check these guys out (we hadn't unpacked our kitchen yet).    We tried the oven baked Turkey Sub and Chicken Parmesan sub first.  Then a couple of nights later we got Pizza on their Monday special (BOGO free).  Both were very good.  The bread on the subs was excellente!  Also, delivery time was quicker than expected.  Looking forward to try new things."}
{"text":"Home Made Special Italian Pizza. Pie was loaded with high-quality & very fresh ingredients. A large is really a large! Greek Salad was typical, but good. Delivery was on-time."}
{"text":"Meh...it's just ok at this point.   Perhaps the problem is that I've never actually gone into the place. I received the whole menu through the mail and I was intrigued so I went on the website and I've ordered from their a handful of times. Each time I try something new to get some variety. Their crab dip was...questionable. I tasted fishier than it should have. The calzones are pretty good...not enought filling though. I tried their spaghetti bake and it was good but too much sauce even though I specified light sauce. It's good but there always seems to be something off about it. I'll try going in next time so they can redeem themselves!"}
{"text":"Ordered  pizza and wings to be delivered literally 5 mins away and both were ice cold when delivered. We have been patrons of this restaurant for years, but will not be returning - EVER!!! We eat there twice a month and it has been going downhill for quite some time. Cheaper ingredients, smaller wings, etc...they used to be top notch, but now it's absolutely terrible. Don't waste your hard earned money...."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Cousin Vinny. I wanted to try something other than a chain for pizza and pasta. I try to support local establishments when possible however I will not pay a return visit when I have a bad experience. We ordered a regular pepperoni pizza, quattro formaggio pasta, and a caprese salad. My  fiance and I loved everything we ordered. The quattro formaggio was excellent, the pizza was great, and the caprese salad was very good as well. This is one local establishment that I will visit again. I'm not sure if the other people caught the service staff on an off day but I found the staff to be incredibly friendly when we went to pick up our order."}
{"text":"We eat a Cousin Vinny's anytime we are in Peoria visiting family.  The pizza is always delicious and the service is great too.   Plus, we were able to sit on the patio with our dog.  We entered using the gate on the side and of course our dog knows his manners at a restaurant."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch last Thursday. The posted hours say they open at 11AM. Guess again. We were outside the restaurant at 11:10 and it still wasn't open. One of us called them - we could hear the phone ringing inside. The man who answered said he would open the door but he didn't have any servers. Then he hung up  while she was still talking. He opened the door and said \"You can come in, but my servers aren't here yet.\" We asked when they might be arriving and he said soon. My friend said \"You hung up on me. I was still talking to you.\" He muttered that he was trying to open the door and he walked away. We sat down and one of us went to get us menus. He went somewhere and never came back. At around 11:20, we 5 decided we could go to another restaurant that really wanted our business and left. Good luck folks!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Have tried several dishes and pizza and all were excellent!! The marinara is to die for. Super yummy!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have not had one bad item on menu. Definitely my family's go to for pizza and more for delivery!"}
{"text":"The pasta here is really great! That seems to be the one consistent. I always get the manicotti, the sauce is delicious. The main problem with this restaurant is the atmosphere and service. There is normally only one server which really drags down the timing of everything. The bread you are served before the meal is silly. I am not sure what that portion is supposed to do. I hope it improves as there aren't a lot of good neighborhood joints around here."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now and OMG it's the best Pizza I have ever had I also have tried three different type every single one was excellent. I met the new owner Kari very impressive I can't wait to go back and see all the improvements. The staff very good remember our names and what we drank after the first time. Debbie & Darby are awesome."}
{"text":"One of our favorite local restaurants. We've been here several time and have not been disappointed. From the calzones, to the chicken parm to the pizzas. Delicious every time."}
{"text":"Best Calzones in town!!! We come from ND every year and HAVE to stop at Cousin Vinny's for a Calzone. Gotta try one!!!"}
{"text":"I can't review the food because our family never actually got seated. Waited for 15 mins while 2 dirty tables sat uncleared. Okay- it's Friday night maybe a little busy but they definitely were understaffed. Nobody spoke to us for 10 of those 15 mins, while I watched 2 incorrect take out orders fail.   Ended up leaving as I watched the hostess who told us the table would be ready continue to wander around serving drinks and cleaning up other tables. I'm sorry- if you're wanting to be a successful restaurant you might want to focus on sitting your guests instead of making us wait 25 mins for a table that just needed to be cleaned."}
{"text":"Went in on a Thursday night so it wasn't crowded. The service was slow considering that number of people actually there. My wife and I both ordered water. Her water came within a couple minutes while I had to wait  5 or so minutes for mine.  I ordered the mixed seafood penne. The shrimp in it was cold. The sauce was bland without much flavor. My wife ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich. She enjoyed it and thought it was pretty good but again not flavorful. The poor service and bland food will have us going elsewhere for Italian."}
{"text":"We ordered the small Buffalo Chicken pizza with a house salad and BBQ wings on the side. The first item that came out was the bread. It was very tasteful and light. That was a plus. The next items were the salad and BBQ wings. The house salad was... Ehh... Just a salad.... Haha. The BBQ wings were pretty good. I could tell that these wings were fried rather than over baked. I love fried wings! That is the second plus. The downfalls comes from the pizza. The cheese was so thick and caked on the pizza that it took away from the balance of the rest of the toppings. Oh and I had a nice long strand of dirty blonde hair weaved through the thick layer of cheese. Pretty funny and disgusting. Haha. The 2 stars mainly comes from the mediocre food. I don't regret giving this place a try; however, I won't be stopping by again."}
{"text":"My son and I had a very difficult time finding this place, and it really wasn't worth what we went through to get there.  We had gone to the Challenger Space Center and since they only had a food cart of hot dogs and flavored ice, we decided to go to this place because it was close.  When I called for directions, the woman told me it was on the right side before I crossed W. Lake Pleasant Pkwy.  WRONG!!!  It was on the left side, after we crossed that street.  When I couldn't find it at first, I called back and another woman told me it is right next to Wells Fargo.  WRONG!!!  It is near it.  They both apologized and one said she is horrible with directions.  I suggested that she lets someone else give the directions.   When we finally arrived, it smelled wonderful, which is a great advertisement.  We ordered a personal size pizza, pasta, and a Cesar salad.  The food was tasty, but portions were really small and not worth the money.  When the waitress said for us to come back, I said that it was extremely doubtful that we would and not to count on it.  We live too far and will not drive there specifically for their food."}
{"text":"Great food & atmosphere. The pizza is thick-crusted and fantastically greasy! Yum!! Classy glasses held our water, fabric napkins kept us clean during our feast & enjoyed the music. Thanks Vinnie for a fabulous lunch!"}
{"text":"Food is canned and frozen. Do not order pasta dishes. I heard the pizza is good but will not be back ."}
{"text":"Their food is absolutely delicious! The free bread, cheese bread, and pizzas are all amazing! The cold cut (Italian) is probably the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Went there with family of 5 unfortunately they only have smaller round tables had to put 2 together worked but still awkward.  Service kind of harried. I ordered a Full Greek salad for $8.95  I received what I would consider a free throw in salad at most places, tiny and basic dressing was ok.  Had Fettuccine Alfredo watery and flavorless. Calzone was good. Pizza was dry, crust was not fluffy or flaky more cardboard like. To many better choices in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is a small neighborhood Italian restaurant they have a freindly knowledgeable staff. This is not fast food the dishes are handmade and may take a little longer but the food is delicious and one of thr best pizzas we have had. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and service. The eggplant Parmasean was very good but could have used more sauce. They charged a $1.00 extra for a very small side of sauce which I though was ridiculous! My daughter had the Meatball sub and it was very good and a large portion.   Second time here had the eggplant Parm again but this time eggplant didn't test that fresh.  Third time I tried the calzone and it was pretty good . My wife had the Chicken Marsala but it should have been called Fettuccine as it just had small bits of chicken in it with a lot of fettuccine pasta in it NOT a nice piece of chicken breast and mushrooms which is what you'd expect. The buffalo wings were dreadfully small, I mean they should be ashamed of selling them that small!  The waitresses are friendly and provide good service and it is a nice atmosphere. Just wish some of the food we've tried so far could be taken up a notch or two."}
{"text":"I first ate at cousin vinnys  with a couple buddies watching the football game. I have to say the pizza  tasted amazing and was great size for the price. You diffently get your money's worth. I was so impressed with the pizza I brought my wife and kids back to try it out during the week. The restraunt was very clean and the staff was very friendly. I would recommend the restraunt for friends meeting up or taking your kids and enjoying the night."}
{"text":"This fabulous restaurant served us lobster raviolis that were the bomb. Also we had crab dip that's was off this planet. The service was excellent and the manager Kari and cook Tom both check on us during our meal and so friendly and informative about their menu. I would recommend this wonderful restaurant to all my friends and family. It was also great to watch the football game on their big screen tv."}
{"text":"Our recent visit to Cousin Vinny reconfirmed what we have previously experienced at this restaurant - freshly prepared delicious food and caring, quality service.  Cassie has been our server the last few times we have been there and she is top notch - welcoming, friendly, and quite efficient - definitely an excellent complement to the whole experience at Cousin Vinny."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we found this place when a pizza craving came about. Not only was the girl on the phone awesome, and pleasant to speak with, the pizza came so quickly and piping hot!   We created our own with pepperoncinis, feta and black olives. The peppers were spicy, there were an amazing amount of olives, and the crust was so fluffy but crusty. Some of the best pizza I've had in a long time!   We will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant - yummy food and great service! The lovely Darby waited on us and she is as cute as a button made our dine in experience from good to great! Recommend this perfect neighborhood eatery:-)"}
{"text":"We went there tonight for the first time. We had pizza which we thought was very good, excellent cheese.  We also split a crispy chicken salad, excellent.  They give you some baked bread sticks to hold you over till your meal comes out, with olive oil, I could of ate 5 plates of those! The beer was cold, the waitress was good, and it was close to home, what else could I ask for? We will be back.    I saw the sub sandwiches, they look like an excellent choice too."}
{"text":"I'm very picky with my pizza and it takes a lot for me to be impressed. I took my family to Vinny's and it was not what I expected. Seriously the best pizza I have ever had. I don't know what they do but it's seriously amazing! I will be going back for life. The best!"}
{"text":"0 stars... DO NOT.... I REPEAT DO NOT  GO TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT!  The Management is down rigth mean. Not only to their guests but to their employees. Whilst we were there a guest complained to the owner about the customer service.  She shrugged her shold and flat out told him if you dont like it here dont eat here.  Then she tried charging us for things we didnt order.  We were with another family and there were errors on there bill. Then she started yelling at the server right in front of the whole resturant that the difference was coming  out of her paycheck. My husband was going over the billing with the owner and trying to compare the prices on the menue to the billing. She tells him flat out I dont care what the prices are on teh menue you at the food.  There was nothing wrong with the food. She was trying to charge us for pasta that we did not order or did not get.  After three times... they bill was finally right with the buy and adult pasta get a childs free. Mind you not only our billing was wrong. there were several other guest in the estblishment stating the same thing.  We left tip in cash on the table. My husband was checking out bank account and our recipt states 33.83 and it posted to our account as f 43.83... Thats stealing. I am reporting them to better business and disputing everything with my creidt card."}
{"text":"I have to say that today Cousin Vinny's really let me down!!! I placed a order for delivery as I have done in the past without any issue but for some reason I guess I am not in there delivery area. Funny I was a few weeks ago but today I am not. The lady who called me back was very rude when I told her I could not pick it up she hung up on me!!! Wow I can not believe this I have ate there more then 50-60 times. Then to be treated like this. I mean if they delivered here before the should of called and said they can deliver here this time but in the future I will have to pick it up. Then just hang up on me WOW!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, fast friendly service Top Notch food. Check it out I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"We tried this place several times and each time disappointed. Service and food varied.  Not as clean as we would prefer. How hard is it in a hole in the wall to mess up service, food and cleanliness??????"}
{"text":"This is a family friendly Italian-American Restaurant that mostly serves pizzas, sandwiches and pasta in a traditional Italian looking setting. They start you off with complimentary baked dough cut in bite size pieces and herbed mild tasting oil.  I decided to try the Thai House Calzone. When I was presented with the calzone I thought it looked beautiful. It had a very perfect looking shape and a nice golden brown color. It also was very large and I know it can feed two people. I liked that it was filled with lots of fresh spinach and vegetables. The flavors were ok...But I had two problems with the calzone. One was the chicken in it. The chicken was some sort of over marinated chicken that had a texture like biting threw rubber. As I was eating the calzone I thought it had melty white cheese in it but I was wrong. It was raw dough. I didn't feel I could send it back because I would just get another one that was the same. I also didn't feel like complaining about it because they only had one waitress on that was waiting on all the tables.   My husband had a sausage sandwich. The sausage used is heavy with sage and the sandwich was more like a pizza just made on sandwich bread with the same thin slices of sausage.The sausage sandwich was really ok and if this review was based on the sausage sandwich I would have given three stars.  Service was pleasant. 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Having had homemade sicillian style pizza every friday night at my grandmothers for 20 years straight, it's easy to see how I could get \"pizza'd out.\" Now this is quite a problem for me, as my husband loves pizza almost as much as he loves me. So any place that has other options for me to enjoy instead rates high on my list, but this place only gets better. Breadsticks are light, fluffy and flavorful. Pizza was delicious. But I had the personalized calzone. Procuitto, bacon, salami, gorgonzola, ricotta and mozzerella. HEAVEN! Perfectly cooked. Crisp crust. Service was a little off, but this place is new and has very few kinks to work out. What they lacked in polish, they made up for in desire to please and effort. Great place and will be going back often!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping this would be a good place since that location has struggled. Not so much. The side of guacamole they gave me was brown all the way around the edges including the sides to the bottom of the container. This means they packaged this hours if not days before giving to me. The food was pretty tasteless and looked slopped together. When I went in to pick it up, I had to search the place for someone to help me even though one of the employees was up front when I arrived but walked to the side of the building. I will not be back."}
{"text":"We had the four cheese baked spaghetti, bread sticks, & coconut shrimp and it was all amazing!! I was surprised how quickly we got seated and served our food. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza and wings. The atmosphere is very lovely and quaint. Small family owned  joint. The work their butts off and are always nice."}
{"text":"We had a group of 10, including 4 children between 4 months and 9 years. Debbie our server was amazing! She took great care of us and was accommodating for our picky eaters.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. People we walked in behind received their chicken pasta, ate it, and paid before we received our wings. We also ordered calamari and were told 20 minutes later they were out of calamari. Sitting here 45 minutes later and still don't have our pizza. Waitress does not seem concerned at all. We will not be returning. They are not busy either;  us and two other tables. Food is not bad but I did not want to spend all night waiting."}
{"text":"Often times when you get takeout pizza, it doesn't stay as well as it would have if you eat there so keep that in mind with this review. The pizza was good, but a bit doughy. The ingredients were fresh, but for some reason lacked \"pizzazz\". We will eat there again for a change of pace, but it is probably our 3rd or 4th favorite pizza place in the area."}
{"text":"This place is usually very delicious but the service tonight was horrible! I ordered a XL pizza and when i got my pizza it was a large, I then called just to see how many slices were in the pizza and to my surprise they did not have an XL but did not disclose that  when I ordered. VERY DISAPPOINTED. There was not enough pizza for my family for dinner. A manager or the guy in charge gets on the phone and says \"no we do not have an XL pizza\" which i advised him that is what i ordered when I called (he was the one I oredered with originally) so i told him that I was not told that now my family doesnt have enough to eat and I would have to order another pizza. (What an inconvenience) he then offered to wave the delivery charge but i couldnt have my family wait another 30 to 40 minutes for another pizza and his response was \"oooh yeah\" I then ordered a medium size pizza advising him that my husband would have to leave our home to get another pizza for our family. He offered no discount or anything for their inconvenience. Its not the point in getting a discount its a point in taking care of your customers. I am sure I will continue to order because they have excellent pizza and we enjoy it; just today was poor customer service. I hope they learn something from this rating. I would usually give them 5 stars. :/"}
{"text":"Another pizza place recommended by a long time local. He has eaten at every pizza place in the area. When arrived early due to all of our hectic schedules we arrived at 3:30.. it was obvious that no one but us was in the this quaint relaxing restaurant. I must point out that our server was exceptional. When we viewed the menu I was shocked to see a reduced menu from what popped up on the web. I order the fried calamari which was described as tubes lightly breaded. We received small round deep fried rings. Not a fan. My wife ordered the prawns. Well she ordered them but didn't receive the prawns because they were out. What about the dinner menu? I feel that since the waitress was not aware of them being out they checked the freezer and either couldn't find them or they were out and pour planning when ordering. I must stress again the waitress was exceptional she checked in regularly and made sure our beverages were full. It's to bad the server is not in a high traffic area where she could make a lot of money.  I asked for a side of meat balls and the meatballs were not in tact but spread over the pasta. I have been eating at Italian restaurants for more than 40 years in New York, Chicago, Las Vegas and Arizona. I have never seen a side order crumbled onto the pasta. I hope this restaurant that is fairly new gets their act together, I would like to try it again."}
{"text":"I had the seafood salad.  It seemed a little small to me.  My wife had Tortellini Alfredo it was much better than the seafood salad."}
{"text":"Cousin Vinny serves up some good Italian. I've had the tortellini and the five-cheese spaghetti bake (with added chicken), and both dishes were phenomenal. Other than Oregano's, you'd be hard pressed to find great Italian food at these prices."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Everything we have ordered here has been delicious...pizza, bread, pasta...very cozy inside!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS... We have finally found our new favorite Italian restaurant!!! This little hideaway is what we have been looking for. As soon as we set down our waitress ,(Missy) brought a plate full of delightful bread with a side of olive oil and vinegerette dipping dish. She recommended to start with calamari or the infamous mussels, we chose the calamari, it was amazing. My daughter had the spaghetti with meat sauce and I chose the Chicken Parmesan, you could taste the homemade freshness in every bite. Such a cute  and cozy place,can't wait to bring the whole family here soon,"}
{"text":"5 Stars EVERYTIME!!  The wife and I frequent this place often. The food is outrageous!  The staff is friendly and awesome!.  That house bread is the best i have tasted and their pizza is so tasty.  Diane is so very nice and comes out to greet us each time we are in!  Try it!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for a salad but changed my mind.  I've been to Cousin Vinny's several times and this time explored the menu.  Decided on crab dip and lasagna. They were delicious!!  I've never had lasagna with the meat on the bottom.  Wasn't over cooked. Noodles were soft. Filling and tasty.  The crab dip was cheesy and could use more crab meat but I loved it! I loved that Debbie, my server remembered me.  I took a star away only because it was a little slow.  But that will not keep me from returning!!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area with my family of 5 and wanted to try something new. Came out to this restaurant and fell in love. Great atmosphere and great food. Kassie, our waitress was wonderful. She was fully engaged in our dining experience. On top of water refill and serving the food hot and in a timely matter, she also shared their made from scratch bread with EVOO and balsamic. And offered up some awesome history on the restaurant when I asked for some info. My hubby and I'll be back tomorrow night for some drinks and alone time without the kids, but all in all great family restaurant. Thank you for a positive experience!!!"}
{"text":"Just came in from LA for some work and stumble over the best Italian spot if your in the area you have to stop by Cousin Vinny's beautiful and fast service. Friendly personalities made me feel like a local I strongly suggest you start with the cheesy bread"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food I'd ever had. The bolognese pasta was unique and full of flavor. The Fettuccine Alfredo was nothing like I'd ever experienced. It had tasty meatballs on top of the pasta that were out of this world. The cheese bread -- OMG -- the cheese was a mixture of mozzarella, Parmesan and feta - AMAZING!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. The mussels are to die for. The food is excellent and so is the service. They now serve brunch on Saturday and Sundays."}
{"text":"We actually had a pretty terrible service experience about a year ago. I talked my husband into giving them a chance again. We like to support small businesses.  Service was terrible. I had to get our menus, had to get out our high chair, and other couples came in after us and were serviced before us.   Food was TERRIBLE. My husband, my daughter and I all had pasta. There was so much oregano, that it was not palatable. I will say that my little guy's pizza was fairly decent, but back to the service... they forgot to make his pizza, so my little guy had to sit and wait an additional 10 mins after we had already been waiting about 40. Mins you the restaurant was not packed.  Take a que from the fact that there are not many cars in the lot.   Management needs to review their restaurant. Oh, and clean their bathroom..."}
{"text":"This place is hidden in a strip mall. Pizza is average, service was slow, they were out of several of the meat pizza toppings. We went with chicken and on the large pizza there wasn't enough chicken to make a sorry taco. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER! Arrived with my other half, asked the first server if we could sit at the bar because we were ordering to go. Ordered a beer while we were waiting. The server that took our order seemed all over the place (this was before they started getting busier) let her know we wanted our order to go. 30 minutes later asked the first waitress if she could let our server know this order was to go, and heard her tell our waitress. 15 minutes after, that our waitress brings out our wings on plates. I had to tell her this was TO GO. 20 minutes after and cold wings later our pizza finally was brought out. We watched people who came in after us get their appetizers and food before our order to go. Completely disappointed, don't know if their wings were good or not because they were cold pizza was great we live less than a mile and half away thought we'd try something new. We won't be dining here again, total disregard for the customer."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in town. Everything is made from scratch. My favorite entree is the chicken parmigiana with cheese bread. You will definitely go int a food coma."}
{"text":"Excellent food. First discovered from delivery pizza but later came to dine in...even better! The house salad and mussels are amazing. Super personable staff too."}
{"text":"We ordered the Greek pizza and it was fabulous. It tasted even better the next day. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorites for wings! They are huge and the sauce is perfectly balanced (not too salty). Awesome and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great food and great costumer service!  I love their cheesy bread and variety of pizzas!  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great time great food prompt service the best pizza ever unbelievable salads wow we are impressed thank you this is the first time ever been in that restaurant amazing wow thank you guys"}
{"text":"The best pizza and pasta around! Plus two new 55\" TVs to watch sports while having a cold 805. Yes please"}
{"text":"It's not quite a pan pizza or deep dish, but Vinny's is a pie with sturdy crust. It has to be, to support all the goodness that gets tossed on it. I had tried their Sicilian pizza...and it's not something you wanna have before a date. Whole cloves of garlic were baked into the toppings. There were also thick, generous slices of tomato, pepperoni, sausage, and olive. The cheese was quality stuff, and I didn't take a bite out of my meal that I didn't enjoy.  Two slices of a large and I was done. This is real food coma material!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! My thin crust Mahgareta pizza was the best!! And my hubby's calzone was incredible! The bread ahead of time was so good! We had a calamari appetizer that was pretty good....but I wasn't there for seafood."}
{"text":"Received a flyer on my door advertising this restaurant so we decided to order delivery. When I called to place the order they were OUT OF PIZZA DOUGH. Are you kidding me, a pizza place without pizza dough?  We had to order something else besides what we wanted. Since I had never tried this restaurant I was open to their menu and had no preconceived ideas of what to expect.  It took an hour for the delivery, the food was only OK, and the price was expensive for what we received. On top of that there was a delivery charge that was not disclosed at the time of placing the order."}
{"text":"There are few times in life when a meal is so expertly crafted as it always is at Cousin Vinnys.  Do yourself a favor and eat all the bread they bring out.  Consider this your cheat day from your low carb diet. Also, if you want pizza, order it thin crust. If you want wings, try honey hot. If pasta is your thing, the chicken parmigiana is worthy of murder and the spaghetti formaggio will have you considering trading your children for another serving.   Do it!!!!! JUST...... DO IT!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoy Cousins Vinnys!  I've been coming here for years the red sauce/gravy is to die for and their entrées and portion sizes are generous!  The service and atmosphere is always top notch!"}
{"text":"We ordered a large 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 sausage, mushroom, and onion pizza with the 20 wings special that was advertised in a flyer for $20.99 delivered to my house.  The girl that answered the phone said that the coupon was only good for a 2 item pizza.  I said that since I was only getting 4 half ingredients that it would be equal to 2 whole ingredients, she said cool.  The pizza was delivered before the promised time of 45 min.  When delivered it was hot and fresh.  They use fresh mushrooms instead of canned mushrooms which beats a lot of places around here (Luckys Pizza, Rays Pizza, Grande Pizza, Fuzzy's pizza.).  The crust was in between a thick crust pan pizza and a thin crust pizza.  It was flavorful and almost a little buttery.  The sauce was the perfect ratio to cheese, unlike Rosati's which tends to use way too much sauce for a thin crust pizza.  The cheese was good and not too thick.  The pepperoni was the the big slices like the slicing pepperoni that Boarshead carries.  The Italian sausage was flavorful and not dry for being a sliced link sausage.  The onion and mushrooms were fresh and tasty.  The wings were good but some of them weren't tossed and covered in sauce.  All in all Cousin Vinnys did a great job.  Since I make pizzas I am quite critical of the ones I get delivered.  I am glad we ordered and will definitely order again."}

{"text":"We just ordered and had our dinner delivered.  Service was prompt, gal on the phone very good.    My husband ordered the chicken Marsala.  They forgot the Marsala wine.  It was Alfredo sauce, chicken was breaded (Oops...Don't think that is the normal thing for Marsala.)  They did not have wine in it...You could see and taste that it was missing.    I ordered the Baked Manicotti with meat sauce.  It was burned on the edges..When I cut into it there was hardly any sauce, just pasta and cheese...It was awful.    We also ordered the meatball soup.  It was really good....So bottom line we paid $28.00 for a $2.50 soup.  We both threw out the pasta...I have never seen my husband not eat his pasta....   We have ordered from them before but it was not the pasta.  I called and spoke with a \"manager\".  She did not appear to give a hoot if it was right or not.  She argued that there was Marsala wine in it....I think the cook is drinking it..."}
{"text":"A hand few of people sitting at tables with a couple at the bar from 5:25 to 7:00 pm on a mid day week 1 waitress, 1 person behind the bar. We got our drinks right away but our pizza took 35 minutes. The toppings on the pizza were fresh, sauce was alright but the dough was a pre-made already cooked pizza dough. Would our family crave going back or would we recommend it, ummm we'll pass."}
{"text":"We had the best pizza. Great time, perfect service. Thank you!  Seriously best pizza ever!! Come check it out"}
{"text":"Spinach Tortellini with alfredo sauce was quite delicious, as well as the Four Cheese Pizza.  Cheese on this pizza was quite thick, almost a chore to cut and serve with the spatula.  Crust is golden, chewy overall, and rather medium in thickness.  Clean & new place with newer furniture, and plenty of round tables.  Server was prompt and polite, and was helpful with menu selections.  Prices were fair.  I wish the tables were bigger.  The little round ones are simply inadequate for 4 people, and really the pizza should be served on one of those elevated pizza holders.  There's just no room.  Draft selection was poor as well with Anheuser-Busch/InBev products only.  Nice quiet lunch spot on weekdays."}
{"text":"I rarely leave bad reviews. But I could not find one positive thing about my first time here. Service was terrible, we only saw 1 person working the entire place. Food quality was less then poor. Atmosphere was terrible as well, you could hear a pin drop. I hope the owner turns this place around for his/her own sake."}
{"text":"The absolute WORST service ever!!! It took 20 minutes just to get our drinks and another 45 minutes later (that's 1 hour and 5 minutes from sitting down) to get our appetizer!!! Never got our food. Our 7 year old was crying from being so hungry. Went to get some tissue to wipe her tears and upon opening the bathroom door, found our waitress doing a line of cocaine!!! We walked out!!!"}
{"text":"So I feel bad I Haven't left  a positive review in the past because everything has always been great Today was not the case. The portion size of the bread you get before you order was much smaller than normal, but not really a big deal.   I almost always get lasagna and today was no different.  However, as soon as I cut into it, I could tell the difference in the consistency.  I thought it was dry because there wasn't much sauce.   Then I realized there wasn't much cheese, just layers of lasagna noodles.    I was definitely disappointed.   Also saw waitress stick her entire hand in a jar of cherries for a mai tai...no gloves..."}
{"text":"The woman working here is very nice. I feel bad for a low review but it just was not very good. I waited ten minutes at the door to be seated and I was the only one in the place. The food was not very good. In fact it tasted very odd to me. I got the chicken Rosemary raviolis and it just tasted strange. Not sure why. I had a horrible after taste in my mouth all night. The bathroom was dirty with no paper towels ( It was 3pm and again no one was in the place)   Maybe they were having an off night? Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?  Perhaps pizza is their thing."}
