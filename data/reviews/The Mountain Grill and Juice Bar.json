{"text":"*TERRIBLE FOOD ALERT*

This place should not be open for service....ever! It needs to be shut down and should not consider opening unless the restaurant can actually service edible food. 

Everything about this restaurant from walking in ....the food, service, atmosphere was a red flag, and my god, do we regret walking in. They had their 4-5 kids running around the restaurant like it was a daycare. You think, having your restaurant adjoined to a daycare meant that not be an issue.

Half the menu was \"unavailable\", their food display area was ALL EMPTY.....I mean, if you don't want to display food, don't have a display area. Simple. 

My friend & I ordered salad with chicken breast/ beef tikka, along with lemonade from their \"juice bar\" ....(maybe if they focused on one thing). The lemonade was what we used to down our \"meals\" because we were hungry and spent a fortune on food that lacked sooo bad on quality, so thank you for having a half decent drink for us to depend on. Both the meats were chewy, and tasteless, and maybe...stale. The salad consisted of dry lettuce leaves, nasty dressing, and a lack of any other ingredient but lettuce. I was really looking forward to having Tabülè, but was served another salad, and in addressing such, all i got was a annoyed face, shrug, and \"You said this salad....\" followed by an immediate walk away. 

On the bright side of all this....thanks for not food poisoning us!!!"}
{"text":"Many of my friends and relatives adviced me to try this new resturant. So I Visited this place last sunday with a group of 8 adults and 5 kids. Wasnt very happy at first because I had to wait 15 minutes for a table to clear. But I dont blame the management because the place was just crazy busy with not a single chair available. This was a whole new experience (something truly different) starting with the great tasty food to the amazing customer service (Family operated and very generous owner)  to the freshly baked desserts and the freshly squeezed juice.  I wouldnt mind waiting an hour next time to be seated. Great family place ,huge supervised kids playground, nice decoration and very comfortable seating. My kids are asking to go there again this weekend. Keep it up !"}
{"text":"The place is massive with a huge play area for the kids that they try and make you pay for...Stromboli's are great, chicken is dry, fries are Cavendish and the ambiance reminds you of somewhat of back home atmosphere.

Price are reasonable...I don't care much for the food here, the servers are wonderful and the juices seem good. but the food is just blah on a street filled with middle eastern goodness.....try if your in the area i guess."}
{"text":"These guys have a massive menu. It went from at one time being Wadi Foods and the more well known Nasr foods to becoming the mountain grill restaurant. It reminds me of the other restaurant with its similar decor down the road Damas Restaurant.  The food is better at Damas which is about a 2 minute drive further east where once stood Steak Queen restaurant. 

This place in particular has an indoor play area for kids which they charge $3 per child. Their menu is a bit on the pricier side with about $20 per plate with tax, tip and drink. 

If you order a meal and think its a sit down place with water being included (since I don't drink soft drinks or juices since I am a health conscious person) the water will not be arriving hence I ordered the water bottle as my friend had already ordered soft drink for himself. Just an assumption gone wrong on my part. 

The food itself had nothing too interesting and was quite lacking in taste. I had a simple dish the Shish Tawook.

All in all the place still has some improvements to climb through as I know they just opened up recently but for now they are sadly one of the few restaurants that are middle eastern with decent decor that have a nice seating area for dinner.

I would have to try some other things on the menu before I go higher on my ratings for this place though since they have a lot to offer from pizzas, sandwiches, burgers and middle eastern platters."}
{"text":"I am only giving it two stars for effort. It needs A LOT of work, but the good news is that it totally has potential. They have a great atmosphere and a children's play area which is great for families. Their decor is pas mal....but not entirely my style. Since they've only been open for one month, I hope with time they can improve...hopefully..

I was put off by their service, cleanliness and food. Three of the most important things in the food business.

Service was VERY slow, waiters were in a rush, no friendly feel (not rude, just not personable). They sent our order to a different table, and one of the girls at my table got her order 45 minutes after we were all done eating.

The washrooms were so dirty, I had to hold it in...(my food microbiology professor used to always say if you want a reflection of how clean the kitchen is, check out their washrooms!)

The food was greasy, specifically the chicken shawarma...way too oily. Their poutine was way too salty, and not enough cheese at all for a poutine...

Thier concept is interesting....but if they don't make immediate improvements I don't think this business will last."}
{"text":"I had an absolutely fantastic experience! This is one place you have to make a staple family outing at least once in a while. There is tons of selection of food, moderately priced, good portions. From pizza to burgers to fresh Mediterranean food (predominantly arab). We had one whole grilled chicken($17) with rice - it was a massive plate and more than enough for 2-3. One small pizza can feed two kids ($6) and the fries and crispy and thick! The burger was also sizeable and fresh.

The food tastes great, but don't expect it to come right away - service is a bit slow but that could be because they only have one or two girls even at an incredibly busy time period. We went Sunday afternoon and it was rammed and wait times. 

Patience is needed and it's pretty much self serve if u want to get things fast. But with the kids preoccupied and out of my face, I don't mind hanging around and waiting 10 minutes more for food. The desert I'd skip - husband said ice wasn't at all quality, or tasted like anything. 

The seating areas are great, spacious and super comfortable. The play area will keep the kids preoccupied and it's supervised, so the adults can grab a tea and relax. There is a charge for the play area ( not that big a fan of that - but it's nominal $3). I honestly just liked being able to take them somewhere other than McDonalds where they could have an indoor playground and eat something remotely healthy. 

I know some may find the decor a bit overdone - but for a family kid loving environment it's great! I love the fact that there is some bedouin print material used for the ceiling that gave it a nice feel. My kids were head over heels! Definitely will be going there again !"}
{"text":"Was invited to meet at this place by a friend/colleague, and was glad I was. There were large family style things ordered when I arrived, and since this seems to be a style of things we all tried a variety of items. (Shish kebab, baba ganoush, humous, and about 6 other things. 

We seemed to order almost everything except the pizza (which was sad as the pizza looked good) The food was quite good, and the playground was amazing, kids having a ball and staff was even supervising; the play area is huge.

The place was clean when I went, I mean very, and was even a sink to wash up conveniently located. 

At the end we had these drinks that had fresh fruit in them and was like a faluda style ice cream. So fresh and tasty. 

Definitely a recommend"}
{"text":"This place used to be Wadi Foods Lebanese supermarket but they revamped it and made it into a huge restaurant. I pass by this place on the road everyday going home from work and have seen the construction progress.

After work one day, I parked and went inside to get a flyer so my co-workers could order Friday. There was so much space in there with a playground gym for kids. The flyer had an extensive menu with lots of full colour pictures and selection.

This morning I called 5 minutes after opening, 11:05 AM and the person on the other line picked up. This was for delivery and there were 11 different orders for lunch take-out delivery. The duration of the call was 15 mins. It was long and I had to repeat my order several times, which was okay because they are a new establishment and wanted to give them a chance.

Unfortunately, they only took cash for deliveries at the moment and had to call me back in a few minutes to find out the full price of the order and asked how long it would take. I think they take credit card if you are eating there.

It had been an hour. The delivery man called my cell phone and was lost. Our building was hard to find so I directed him to it. When he came to the building he had a smile and was trying his best to get the food to us quickly. We paid him the money and we proceeded on.

He called us back stating that they forgot the garlic sauce and hummus and would be back to our office in 7 minutes. I called him back because they forgot one order of wings. He arrived and he gave his sincere apologies on missing the orders.

Everybody had their food (pizza, shawarma, stromboli) and really, they all said the same thing. The food was alright/okay. Nothing out of this world. Some said, \"meh\". I had a chicken shawarma sandwich and poutine which as okay. The poutine tasted like something from Costco which I did not mind much.

After it was all said and done, I went to calculate the total. They had a primitive receipt system and there were only prices on it and not descriptions. I had to manually cross reference the totals with each order which was time consuming.

There seems to be extra charges not accounted for. I am going to go to the place after work to see how the totals were calculated.

This place is brand-spanking new. We will probably give it a little more time to pick up and get better. Who knows? It has a lot of potential. Go head and try it and see what you think!"}
{"text":"I watched this place be built and finally decided to go with our family. The highlight being that it has  a indoor playground for kids . We attended and our kids went into the play area we found a table and were given menus. Menu has at least 50 items to choose from, with many photo descriptions. We had to go up to cashier to order food and did so at which time we were told we were being charged 3 dollars per child to use play area. The children were already playing in area and we were not informed in advance of the fee. We paid fee and waiting for food to be prepared which is done in a open kitchen cafeteria style prep area. Unfortunately we observed the cooks engaging in very unsanitary behaviours. 
- phones in and out of pocket with bare hands and continued to prepare food without washing hands.
-scratching crotch area and continuing to prepare food.
- the last was watching a cook wipe with bare hand sweat off his neck and then use bare hands to move fries over on plate which happened to be ours.
- we then asked for a refund based on what we observed and were told no initially though were then given a refund with no apology .

This place could of had potential , but with poor sanitary practice and no customer service in an area full of middle eastern cuisine I don't see them lasting long."}
{"text":"The kids zone Keeps my two year old busy a fussy eater he seemed to enjoy the Arayes... nuff said!!

Nice staff too which seems hard to find in the Scarborough area

Cant say how long the order took as was busy with the kid in the ball pit..


1 small Aryes
2 juices 
Kids zone
$21.00"}
{"text":"This place is a bit of a gong show when it comes to service.... Extremely disorganized, understaffed, no welcoming smile only looks of distress and being overwhelmed on faces of staff.   

I had a falafel sandwich and it was above average, fried fresh and was light and crunchy but man do they need to work on customer service."}
{"text":"The food was awful they had the worst kebabs I have had. Giving them two stars for the decorations. Prices are expensive will not go again"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food due to the fact the kids play area was so dirty and disgusting there is no way I would eat there.  We left after 10 mins.  There was garbage all over the floor old food old socks, the floor clearing is not cleaned on a regular basis.  The next issue is there was no heat on in play area and it was freezing.   With all the clean play centers for children there is no need to settle for this very dirty one.  Highly disappointed."}
