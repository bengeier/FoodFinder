{"text":"On Friday, my mom and I went here. We've kept our eye on this place for  while, but we finally decided to come here because we had no idea where else to go.

When we arrived, we were greeted by two sweet ladies, and let us sit anywhere. We sat in the booth area. The decor in the restaurant is very modern, and looked very nice and presentable. We sat down and ordered our food. I ordered the Penne alla Vodka. The food took around 10-15 minutes to come, so it was relatively fast for a dine in restaurant. When the food came, it was all plated nicely. It tasted so good. I loved it so much. My mom was also very pleased with her meal. We had a conversation with our waitress, and she was Italian herself, and pronounced everything on the menu and on the specials board perfectly. Also, you can here the chefs in the kitchen talking in Italian, which proves that the restaurant has authentic Italian cuisine. 

I would 100% recommend this place. Every aspect of this restaurant is amazing and I have absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"The staff here are all super super nice and give great recommendations, and the food comes out pretty quickly, however, the food does leave a little to be desired. 
I shared the primavera pizza to start, which was ok - the sauce was a little too sweet and the veggies were still pretty crunchy, but it was alright. I also had the orecchiette con rapini, which again, was ok, but lacked flavour but was very salty, and SO oily. There was more than a puddle of oil at the bottom, like so much that I drained a ton of it out onto an empty dish before eating. My dining partner had rigatoni bolognese and said it was ok too. 
An ok place if you are looking for a quick meal and friendly service, but probably not my first choice for Italian food in the area."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. I ordered the Prima Vera. The eggplant wasn't even cooked. Tasteless sauce. Don't recommend."}
