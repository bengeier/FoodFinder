{"text":"Menu hasn't changed in a decade. Staff is rude. Prices are outrageous. Shut it down. We can use the space for something."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat at. It's nice and fresh. Came during the lunch rush but they had so many workers working to make sure the line kept moving. Took about 10 minutes for my order which was the Cali club. It was full of turkey and so delicious.  The tea they had wasn't all that great or I'm just not used to their tea. My go to dish is the raspberry fields salad or the Cali club."}
{"text":"I noticed one bad review for this place so I wanted to add a more balanced one. I've gotten take out lunch from here many times over the past few years. Its conveniently located in the overstreet mall along with several other fast food places. I usually get one of their wraps, the Lil Red Rooster. Its a tasty and filling lunch, and reasonably healthy option. They also have other wraps, sandwiches, and soups. If I need a quick lunch, this is always one of my best places to get it. They normally are not too crowded and turn by order around quickly and friendly. They also do a nice breakfast wrap."}
