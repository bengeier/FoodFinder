{"text":"was pretty disappointed, dance floor was empty on a Friday night, music wasn't the greatest,  though the staff at the bar were quite friendly and nice.  There was a $5 cover to get in which i thought wasn't worth it.. could go to a normal pub and bar with better ambiance without being charged for cover.   A few girls got kicked out by security at the table next to ours, it seemed like they were just having a fun time and dancing away, so that really sucked for them.. As for me,  I will not come back here."}
{"text":"From out of town. Food is amazing. Close to hotel,staff is amazing and quick. Highly recommended. Thanks for great service."}
{"text":"Wait staff was soooo horrible. They asked for a credit card to start a tab while we were eating dinner. Brought the wrong drink and argued about it then charged us. Kept coming for payment while I was eating. She was smoking cigarettes. Maybe that's why we didnt get cutlery napkins or plates... then she added the tip in the bill when she deserved nothing"}
{"text":"I came here with my brother to watch the latest UFC match. First of all, they charged a 5$ cover. Who the f___ does that? Especially at bars. Okay, fair enough they have a nice screen, I said. Then, out of nowhere, they turned the sound off and started blasting music onto their dance floor behind. So let me get this straight... you dimwits charged me cover so that I could watch a muted UFC match, while being deafened by dance music from behind and not being able to say a word to my brother sitting next to me... The four alarm wings that I ordered were nowhere near as spicy as I expected. The ones at the downtown location are a thousand times tastier (not just in terms of heat) Totally agree with the previous comment about 7 wings being considered a pound. How pathetic. Oh and one more thing, the waiters always kept coming to us every few minutes asking if we wanted more drinks.... LOL Definitely not coming back here."}
{"text":"This place is an insult to pubs and an embarrassment to restaurants everywhere.   The service is appalling. Staff is highly untrained and do not know how to induct themselves professionally.   As a large group with some underage individuals we were discriminated against and \"spied\" on by staff members (presumably to watch our behaviour)   Food is well below average. I order the wings they were cold and apparently 7 wings qualifies for a pound here.   DO NOT EAT HERE FOR ANY REASON WHAT SO EVER. There are many other restaurants in the area with better service."}
{"text":"Horrible place. They can't decide if  they want to be a bar or a club. Food is below par and the service is slow."}
{"text":"Mediocre bar food at best and the restaurant desperately needs to hire more waitresses especially for game nights. Came here for UFC night and this place charges $5 cover, which would be perfectly fine if we received any service. Since they are charging cover and anticipating a busy night, they should have more than 4 waitresses for the entire place.   Had a pint/pound beer/wing deal and I am certain there's less than a pound in there. Part of our order was missing and we could not find the waitress for 30 minutes. When they do come around, they never bother to look up or around for any other tables needing help, probably because they're over worked."}
{"text":"Very sweet and attentive waitresses, but wasn't impressed that it took two tries before I got a glass of water. Also, they charged me for tip TWICE. I didn't say anything because honestly I just wanted to get the F outta there and go home. Cool dance floor and they played songs from like the early 2000's so I'm assuming this is a lounge for wayback playlists. In conclusion, I probably won't come back here, even if they do play poppin' oldies."}
{"text":"Average Joe bar/restaurant for food. I shared the platter of nachos, pouting and two pounds of wings. Service was lacking and it was hard to get a hold of the waitress. They even forgot to bring out a pound of wings we ordered. We waited without touching the first pound because we weren't sure if it was our and by the time we confirmed, the wings were quite cold. As for the interior,  the booths are alright and somewhat comfy and cozy. If you don't like to snuggle up with people in a grou o of 7, then I suggest to ask for a non booth. Overall my experience was average. However I was surprised after 10 the floor in front of our booth became a dance floor with a live dj."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chipotle chicken wrap and fries with gravy. Was super delicious and would order it again in a heartbeat.  She forgot my side of coleslaw but ordered it to go with my leftovers. Service was very slow but personally I was not in a rush so I didn't mind. Would come back here again for sure."}
{"text":"Great Salmon!  Set outside & enjoyed The band playing on the patio.  This is within walking distance of the Holiday Inn. The vegetables were mentally saut√©ed in an oriental sauce. They also have earlybird will cost beer. I sat outside on the patio it was Great weather and listen to the band along with a large group of other people."}
{"text":"Plenty of haters. I don't get it.  Cheap food. Cheap drinks. Daily specials. No cover charge ($5 on game nights and events). Live DJ playing sickest beats. Spacey dancefloor. Huge patio with comfy seats if you want to take a break from dancing and the loud music. Great crowd (mainly Desi). Staff are awesome especially the security guy."}
{"text":"We came to watch the fight tonight and it was crowded. We order some food like the platter. Nacho, salad, pizza and they were pretty good. The device was also very good although sometime was slow but understandable. Lot of TV inside and dancing was right after."}
{"text":"My hotel is right next to this place so I've been coming here for years.  Here's a list of features this restaurant/pub has:  - Cold beer. - Food that a child might make for their parent. - The confusion of being the only person in a place that can easily hold 100+. - The joy of receiving horrible service considering the one guest to four worker ratio. - Servers that look like they'll go home with you if you have some coke in your car. - The tvs that sometimes have that night's sporting event on. - The promise that around 1am the place will be packed and exciting.  Bottom line, come for a beer and don't expect much.  This place is not a British pub by any means.  I wouldn't be surprised is there is more going on here than just a restaurant."}
{"text":"Avoid this place!!! I should have known not to come back after they forgot a whole pound of wings when we ordered take out and charged us for it. Went out with a group of 7 on Friday evening and our waitress was never to be found even though that place was dead. At one point we saw her sitting at a table with a bunch of guys clearly flirting. I get you need to work guests for tips but at the very least make sure your other tables are getting served. We had to flag down another server to ask for drinks and get better service. The food was subpar and my beer was flat. I didn't bother asking for another since it took so long to receive the first one! At the end we split the bills and didn't realize she already added gratuity to the bill, even though we were only 7 in our group(??) She ended up getting $70 tip on oue $145 bill. Extremely frustrating. We are definitely never coming back to this place. There are a ton of better eats in Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"4 stars**** for a pub... -1 cuz its in Toronto. Lol.. Seriously though, I have been here twice and this second time around I am got the same thing I had last time... Bangers and mash..   So few \"pubs\" seem to offer such a thing these days, relying on such things as nachos, wings and burgers Instead.  These guys retain a lot of a real pub feel, music is not too loud (at least when we were there) place was clean friendly and the prices great. Beer was CooOOoold which is always a nice touch, instead of just slightly chilled.  But for me it's the food, the last time I was here I had a few wings because they were on special, I found them a bit on the low quality side, but the sauces were ok. Where this placed shined was the bangers and mash.. Loved it!  My wife had the Thai stir fry and totally enjoyed that too!  We have stayed at the sheraton here for work for a week, and being trapped without a car, we have visited many of the local more expensive places all week. We found this a nice change and wish we came here sooner.   If you stop by I hope you enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Fox and the Fiddle is your average pub with drink specials and pub food. They have the typical items on the menu that you would expect at a pub. I don't see much that sets them apart from other pubs except the popular name, as there are a chain of Fox and the Fiddles.   The day we went (Thursday) it was half price burgers and $7 domestic mini pitchers (A pint and a bit). We all ordered a mini pitcher each and some burgers. We got 3 burgers. Whiskey BBQ burger with fries, Tex Mex Burger with fries and Mushroom Cheese Burger with a garden salad. The burgers were on par with burger from other pubs, but nothing special. Same with the sides. Beer is great wherever you go. Only thing that I'd say was above average was the service and the value for the menu items that we ordered. Also the patio is spacious and there is a DJ. All Fox and the Fiddles in my opinion are about the same. I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"Was there on Saturday night....the waitress was a big clueless and didn't answer our questions correctly. Food was well below average. The screens were great, too bad there was a terrible DJ playing awful music so the volume was turned off. Would not return, this place is just awful. It's in dire need of renos."}
{"text":"Decent pub. Good service and great specials during the leaf games and raptor games. Food was pretty average. I liked their buffalo chicken poutine."}
{"text":"So we made reservations to come here for the UFC fight, they charged a $5 cover which was fine. We made reservations for 8, but they gave us a table against the wall for 6 so we couldn't even add chairs to the end of the table and made it sound like they were doing us a favour for giving us a table at all. AND they had the audacity to ask us if they could take our chairs. We waited at least 20 mins and no one came to give us a menu, ask for our orders, or give us water. We had to go to the bar to hunt down a server, and even after that we had to wait another 10 mins for service. To be fair, when the server did come over she was friendly...but we were basically ignored the whole night. We had empty pitchers, we tried to wave down servers but nothing. Every time we wanted something we had to hunt someone down at the bar, and it would then take another 10-15 mins for someone to finally serve us. The place was not busy considering there's a major sporting event going on what-so-ever. So I guess they are not used to having more than 3 tables at once. We had to ask for the same order several times because they kept forgetting items or getting our orders wrong. All in all, service was...actually...there was no service at all. While I'm typing this review, I have been here for over an hour, and still haven't received my food order yet...so you be the judge. #foxandfiddlerichmondhill #noservice"}
{"text":"Do they ever train their wait staffs anymore? Or they just give them the uniform (super mini skirt) and just let them learn everything on their job and learn from their mistakes?  $12.50 tax in for a pitcher of domestic beer/half price wings?  Leafs game on? and we are beating the NY Rangers away? Good companions that let me be silly and talk about nonsense.. no need to be a respectable yelpers?  I am IN!!  Fox and Fiddle seems to have all the right elements for a good night out. But everything fail badly, aside from the good companions.  My waitress not sure about a lot of things...  - what's the special $12.50 tax in Pitcher... she had no idea... and went to ask... - what's different cost of the different pints... she had no idea... and went to ask - she mixed up our chips with gravy and bring us one without it and charged us the full price - she has the expensive premium pint on our bill and charge us $17.50 for the pitcher - her excuse is she just here for 2 days.... meh... the guy she trying to sweettalk in might buy that... not me!  The Chicken Wings here were huge but dry.... the batter was thick... even I was half drunk, I cannot stomach them....maybe I need more beer to wash them down? $10 for 2 lbs? Price is good but taste is not!  Chips were not bad... I definitely have better.....  The crowd did get rowdy.... The bartender asked them to tone it down but was not working.....   Football and Hockey both showing on TV... you can pick your pick of what you prefer to watch...... that's a little bit more interesting than CP24?  Open WIFI is a nice touch... as I start using it to upload some of my photos to Yelp...."}
{"text":"Avoid. So many other bars around the area with much better food, atmosphere and decor.   This place was renovated several years ago but it's beginning to get old again. Bouncers at the door are a**holes with temper problems.   Avoid like a plaque. It amazes me how this place stays open."}
{"text":"Apparently the preppy properly dressed managers require that the waitresses wear thongs and go braless on their teeny tiny dresses (or long belted tank tops).  I really shouldn't see the ass cheeks of the waitresses. Classy."}
