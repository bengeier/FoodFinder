{"text":"I made plans to dine at this place on a monday night. Walked in. Lights were on. There was no one at the hostess stand. After a minute or two this guy appeared  and said \"sorry no one showed up so we closed the restaurant.\" Moral of the story: call ahead cuz they open and close on a whim."}
{"text":"Lunch hour is so packed and the service is very slow... i feel it's too slow. food was just so so, my friend had mushroom soup and i had soup of the day which was tomato soup. I hope the mushroom soup is better than mine because mine tasted like canned tomato soup and the croutons were soggy already. i had the fish of the day, rainbow trout, fish was decent, the potatos on the side were meh. my friend's cobb salad looked good but i noticed that she didn't finish the chicken. not sure why..."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to visit Far Niente for a Winterlicious lunch as it was located on the PATH (and considering the weather, was a definite plus!) and their menu looked delicious.  We were greeted promptly and were seated in a quieter section of the restaurant, which I was thrilled about. We ordered sparkling water (Eska) and the waiter dropped off a basket of freshly baked bread and deliciously salted butter.   We ordered the fish cake and beet & squash salad for our appetizers, the snapper and steak frites for our mains, and the brownie and pear tartlette for our desserts.  My friend seemed very happy with her fish cake, and I was quite happy with my salad (the blue cheese dressing wasn't too overpowering.) I loved my steak frites - the steak was cooked perfectly to medium rare. The accompaniments were also enjoyable. My friend enjoyed her snapper, which came with Israeli couscous, and was full by the end.  The dessert was the only slightly miss of the meal. My friend found her brownie to be a little too dense and \"fudge-y\" (her words!), but loved the coffee-flavoured mousse. The crust on my tartlette felt a bit too dry and crumbled too easily. I also wasn't overly fond of the blue cheese mousse on the top. The idea made sense, but execution wasn't the greatest.  Our server was really nice and very attentive. We would be back for sure."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try out Far Niente for Summerlicious 2014. It was a lack lustre experience.   Food: Because there were three of us, we decided to order one of everything.  Apps.  Chilled Melon and Mint Soup  - The worst out of the three. Yes, it's melon soup, but there was no seasoning or any flavour. It was like sweetened water. My poor friend had one bite and sent it back.   Asian Pear and Cabbage Salad - It was alright. Lots of cabbage, couldn't find any Asian pears.    Brandade & Crisp Ham - Literally a garden salad with bacon on top.   Main.  Quinoa Crusted Salmon - This was the highlight of my meal. It was so good. The salmon was not overcooked and the Qunioa gave it a nice texture.   Achiote Fried Chicken - Two thumbs down. The chicken was dry and the meal needed much more seasoning.   Thai Curry - Tasted like take out. I could have gone to a much cheaper restaurant and receive better quality.    Dessert. Chocolate Gianduja Mousse - We all decided to order this. It was alright. Not overly sweetened by any means. No other dessert jumped out at us.   Service: I don't know if it's because it's Summerlicious but the service here was downright terrible. The waitress got out order wrong all three times. For the apps we would receive two of the same items, same with the main and for the dessert even though we ordered the same dessert somehow she managed to get that wrong as well. No apology as well.   I would not return on an regular day."}
{"text":"I went there last night for winterlicious. The service was great, decor and ambiance was great, and food was good... the appetizers (goat cheese croquette and BLT salad) were very tasty, angus steak was alright, could've had a bit more flavor, and the dessert was tiny but decent."}
{"text":"Modern Downtown Upscale Restaurant   Pros: - Excellent Service (especially from Bibek) - Beautiful Presentation (Food and Decour) - Intense Balance Flavors - Validated Parking - Private Room available for events  Cons:  - Not a good place to go if avoiding sodium  Recommend  - Lobster Pot Pie (A good portion, whole lobster tail) - Fries with Truffle Mayo - Asking for a table in Bibek's Section"}
{"text":"I have been to Far Niente twice, once for lunch and another time for dinner.  The atmosphere during the day is that of a classy professional setting, for dinner the mood is very mellow and relaxed - even romantic with the candle lights.  The food is out of this world with a great mix of flavours, styles, and stunning plate presentations.  They definitely put a lot of emphasis on detail and taste.  I had the Dorset Lamb Hind (Rogan Josh Curry, Saffron Kalijira Rice & Mango Mint Chutney) - and it was out of this world.  Also, the service was top notch!  The only reason I am giving them 4 stars and not 5 .. is because my date didn't enjoy the food as much as I did .. lol"}
{"text":"Went for after work drinks with a friend and had a great experience. The patio is much more casual and relaxed than the dining room, and a great way to enjoy the sun after a busy day. We each had a cocktail & shared the flatbread. If you like blue cheese, I highly recommend to try it - had a unique flavour and was great for sharing. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"You pay for the beautiful decor and decent service but the food is disappointing. When I went there for Winterlicious they explained to us, they are known for \"portion control\" ? which means expect 7 pieces of pasta when you order the pumpkin squash pasta dish. Also they ran out of several of their Winterlicious items when our group went which meant a few people with allergies didn't get dessert.  I feel like this is more of a \"drinks\" place as the dining room is huge and there is a lot of privacy, but you would think they would charge less if they are giving you less than other places.  I went back recently to see if  the regular menu was better than Winterlicious. It's not."}
{"text":"Went to Far Niente during Summerlicious and I am a Fan, planning to go back to trry out different menu."}
{"text":"I'm giving this one star because of the service - terrible. If you prefer the uppity, pretentious types then this is the place for you.  The food was good from what I can recall but nothing that stands out to me. The awful service kind of outweighed everything else."}
{"text":"Far Niente is our go-to place after really intense medical appointments.  It's usually a Monday evening, the service attentive without being pretentious, and the food is fabulous!  This most recent visit, I opted for the Mahogany Glazed Halibut: kabayaki roasted halibut, quick fried spring vegetables, sesame crusted shiitakes, pureed mushroom sauce (taken directly from their website.)  I also had a taste of my husband's Soup of the Day: wild mushroom - just heavenly!  Oh yes, and the only dessert we ever have are the FN Chocolate S'mores - homemade marshmellows, Cinnamon Graham Crumble, Dark Chocolate Chip Brownie, Lindt Chocolate Ice Cream - because Dark Chocolate is good for you, right?"}
{"text":"Came for lunch.  Got the daily soup and the crispy chicken (a tad salty).  Thought it was a bit pricey for what you got.  I want to give it a higher rating but I just can't - probably because this place doesn't have the same pomp as some other places around it, so expectations aren't as high."}
{"text":"The food I ordered here was excellent.   For appetizer to start I had the calamari with a tomato chorizo sausage sauce. Main was stuffed pork chops. Perfectly prepared and tasted well.   To drink a freshly squeezed fruit juice which was very refreshing and energizing.  Service was spot on and attentive."}
{"text":"Superb place to dine! They even customized my main dish as what I wanted was only available as an appetizer. Great service. Very attentive to food allergies."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here a couple of times now (all for lunch) and the best I can come up with is \"meh\".  It's sad, really, because the place could be so much better, but it just isn't.   In mist recently on Thursday and sat outside at the deck, which was surprisingly nice.  I didn't know the person I was meeting for lunch, and the confused wait staff kept bringing people by my table to see if they were the person I was meeting - didn't quite connect with the fact that there should be a name associated with a table, not just \"guy meeting someone\".   I had the pickerel special, and it was pretty soggy and bland.  Bread service was fine, and the highlight was the biscotti that they brought with coffee after.   I'm sure that lunch is a really hard meal to pull off, but it shouldn't be this hard."}
{"text":"The staff was rude because I was not fully dressed like a bay street broker. The space is nice, but if you look closely the ceilings are pretty dirty. The food was ok, but nothing special. There are too many place similar to this restaurant downtown and will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch there. We sat on the patio and the atmosphere is very nice. I ordered the Crispy Chicken and my appetizer was the Ceasar salad. I loved both. Good portion size too. The service was great. And lunch was delivered fast (even though we had a group of 8). My only complaint would be the desserts They should do more homemade style desserts. These looked boxed and not the most fresh. Either way, I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Visited during winterlicious. Delicious food, amazing service, classy interior. Very business oriented"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is still around. Ordered the two soups which were average. Sushi for one friend, cobb salad for the other and 'pizza' salad for me. Salads took WAY too long to come out. Mine was ok but the cobb salad was basically some iceberg lettuce with too much dressing, a piece of chicken and a slice of bacon (salad was ordered without cheese). It was not worthy of being called a cobb salad.   And I hate it when restaurants do this. We ordered a bottle of sparkling water. When that was done they started serving us a second bottle that we never ordered. By the time I realized it, the meal was over and they tried to bill us for both bottles. I told the waiter we didn't order the second and he took it off."}
{"text":"Went for a business lunch. Food was generally good ( except for the vegetables which were so over cooked they were difficult to identify). Server was pleasant and helpful but it was UNACCEPTABLY slow. Slow to take our order, slow to get our food slow to get our bill. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"My boy friend and I have decided to go on a mission to try all of the top 50 restaurants in Toronto. We had already been to 8 of the restaurants. The first one we decided to try was Far Niente. I have very high standards when it comes to the food industry, especially fine dining. So when trying a restaurant that is in the top 50 in, I have extremely high standards.  The restaurant itself was quite nice, I liked the decor. The hostess was very friendly and they offer complimentary coat check.  Before leaving the house I had called to enquire about a corkage fee which they do have $35. We brought our bottle of wine and had them chill it. I having worked in the food industry before have extremely high standards of service when it comes to my server at any restaurant.  Our server(dont know his name) didn't even try to be friendly exchange pleasantries throughout the meal. Our wine came after our appetizers. My appetizer was missing the bread that was supposed to accompany it. I didn't say anything as I was bitter sweet(don't want the carbs). My appetizer was taken away with both fork and knife, leaving me with one fork and one butter knife. My main dish was served and my knife was never replaced leaving me to eat with my butter knife. The service was slow.  Food Seared Sea Scallops-4/5 Citrus Cured Smoked Salmon-2/5 missing the warm rye croutons and the fennel salad had no taste Seared Bluefin Tuna-4/5   Repeat- Definitely NOT. I am not one to complain at restaurants, I sit there silently stew and then report back here."}
{"text":"Did the summerlicious lunch here.  I usually lower my expectations for this period due to the volume.  We had a small party of 6.  Our table mix and matched pretty much all the offerings on the summerlicious menu and no one was really wowed.  I had the chilled watermelon soup which was a nice surprise as I've never tried it before - very refreshing with a mild salsa taste.  My rainbow trout was cooked well, but the rosti underneath was on the salty side.  Others ordered the flat iron steak, which appeared reheated.  My mini-pie dessert was good, but the fudge brownie was less than impressive.  It was a bit frustrating because I was here for a lunch about a year ago and the food was better, although the restaurant was much emptier.  Considering the other offerings in the financial district, this only gets 3 stars for the price point."}
{"text":"We went for the winterlicious dinner.   The starter salad was good, the desert flavourful and smart.  But the mains seriously disappointed. The steak was medium rare, a good cut, but I wasn't asked how I wanted it prepared. The 'vegetable pot pie' that accompanied it was only barely warm when it arrived, and was, nonetheless, over-cooked and dry. It contained a very thin layer of slightly soggy vegetable, mainly carrot in a nice pastry shell that was too dried out at the edges to eat. The idea that in 2011 a main would include virtually no vegetables - well, it's shocking is all I can say. Is it because it is a winterlicious sampler menu? Would it have added so much cost to the main to throw on some beans or peas?   My partner got the snapper main and it also sorely lacked in the vegetable department. His fish was dry, completely without character, and a little chewey at the edges.   We appreciate that the winterlicious menu isn't the standard fare of the restaurant, but if it had been impressive, we would have gone back. As it is, this restaurant won't be on our list, and we won't be recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"For the price they charged, the food was really sub-par.  I had 2 appetizers (one as a starter the other for my lunch).  The green salad with mixed root veg chips was not that great.  The root vegetable chips were tasty but why would they put sour cherries and pickles in a salad like this... I don't know... way too much dressing on the salad too. I had a seared tuna with some greens and fruit mash thing at the bottom and supposedly with avocado (which was one tiny, thin slice and they didn't even take the skin off).  Tuna was good but again, i've had better. My friend's fried chicken was raw in the middle and they didn't even take it off the bill.  I am glad I wasn't paying... i wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great new menu. Thanks Far Niente. It was time. I had a lobster salad and a beautiful piece of swordfish. Top shelf."}
{"text":"The end of summerlicious kinda marks the beginning of the end.  Like Winter Solstice marks the middle of winter, the end of 'lish marks the dog days of summer and the thoughts of the fall starts to enter into the equation and is just over the horizon.  This year Far Niente closes out a mediocre 'lish season.    Far Niente tries hard, and I'm sure wishes itself to be considered amongst the elite in Toronto fine dinning, but it's a bit \"far\" fetching.  Don't get me wrong, there's no one thing that I can pinpoint that would make this place a bad experience, just the opposite, it's a nice experience, but just not very noteworthy.  The service is good, food is good, its got the fine dinning feel to it, but it lacks a certain something that makes me think \"far out\" when it comes to a fine dining place.  Maybe it's just because there are so many other better options in Toronto.  It's like a pretty girl saddled in a room full of other hotties and she just doesn't stand out.  It's also hard to judge a place by it's summerlicious menu, but there was absolutely nothing wrong with my Seafood gazpacho, rare tuna, and quite enjoyed the Angel food cake.  It was all nicely executed, but if I were not to document this right away, I won't remember what I had in another 3 or 4 hours.  Good experience?  Yes?  Most amazing meal of my life?  A bit Far fetching.  http://app.toronto.ca/food2/DineSafeMain?userRequest=view_history&ESTABLISHMENT_ID=10365330"}
{"text":"Found the food ordinary, seating very crowded, car parking not convenient, and most important they do not have an elevator to take you down 2 flights of stairs to the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Well, it seems to be a trend with this place...we came here with a client for dinner one night and we were the only table seated in the restaurant - always a bad sign!  The service was polished and professional, the atmosphere was nice and the food was good.  Someone in my party ordered the watermelon salad and they loved it.  All of us ordered the grilled swordfish for our entree and it was quite tasty and just the right portion.  Overall the meal was of high quality, but I am concerned for the longevity of this place with so few patrons."}
{"text":"As Yelp puts it Meh. I've experienced better, and that sums it up perfectly.  The place on the inside is gorgeous! At first I walked in and thought \"this will be a 10\". After the food began coming out it dropped, and quick. First, I would like to point out the menu they provide you does not mirror the one on the Toronto Tourism website for Summerlicious, so I had to slightly alter what I was ordering- no biggie.  The food was very unmemorable to be honest. The food could have been easily replicated any where else. I had the one salad, which was meh, the meat and potatoes which was meh. I will say the meat was very unevenly seasoned. Some parts were spicy, others were just dry. Lastly, I had the PB and J cake. This was dry, it was overall not great. It also tasted a tad over cooked.  The service, was not the best. Our waitress was not overly friendly but we had a vibe she hated her job. Since it was near the end of Summerlicious (last weekend actually) they should have their act together. I ordered 2 of the Berry Whites which I guess were signature drinks for the occasion and on the menu it states $8.00 however my bill said $10.00. Had this been the first week of  Summerlicious I would be understanding. But its the 4th, so I wonder if they overcharged people the whole time.  I have no desire to return."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend! I loved the food! This place is huge, very busy during brunch/lunch hour because of all the suits coming from the nearby offices.   The mushroom risotto was the best! They gave a good size portion, I was getting so full but had to finish my plate because it tasted too great. The breads and butter were beautiful too. I'm normally not a bread and butter person but the presentation looked too cute so I tasted a bit and glad I did,   The alcoholic mixed drinks were your money's worth, not stingy at all.   This is a great place, amazing food, knowledgable staff, def coming back for more :)"}
{"text":"I was traveling alone on business and ended up getting lost in the Toronto underground one evening and came upon this place.  It was past the rush crowd (get a drink and take the train home crowd).  So I walked in and sat at the bar.  Service was really good, wine selection was excellent and they had hockey on TV.  I had the pizza (pesta-arugula) which was good, not the best crust, but I am in Toronto and have lower expectations.  I also had the chicken yakitori sliders which were excellent.  I would return if I were stuck downtown again for business."}
{"text":"Had lunch here a little over a week ago with a group of colleagues.  We made a reservation for the patio and I am happy we did.  We arrived on time and were seated right away.  There were 8 of us in total and the service was really speedy considering the size of the group.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable, very friendly and accommodating.    We ordered the crab cakes, the Caesar salad, crispy chicken, fish and chips and a host of other dishes.  The crab cakes, fish and chips and the crispy chicken proved to be favourites among the group.  I can't honestly remember what every one ordered, but those who ordered these dishes raved about them the most (including me, as I had the crab cakes and the crispy chicken).  The crab cake was extremely flavourful and perfectly cook.  The chicken was a little dry, but the coating on the chicken was very tasty and quite aromatic.  My colleague across from me had the fish and chips and she said it was good.  The French fries that came with the fish and chips were really good too.  Their wine list is quite extensive and reasonably priced.  They also had freshly made juices and tho I didn't have any, those who did raved about them.  The patio is quite nice, with ample seating and a lot of tropical plants surrounding the perimeter of the patio.  It's a great lunch spot for the patio alone.  From what I understand, the patio is used by Far Niente during lunch and Four uses It in the evenings.  After lunch, it had started to rain so we made our way inside for dessert, which was by far, the most disappointing part of the meal.  The creme brulee was average at best, the chocolate layer cake tasted like it was fresh out of the freezer, and the gelato tasted like chocolate soft serve ice cream.  I guess this place has built it's reputation on its entrees, not its desserts, which is unfortunate.  The coffee we had with dessert was quite good though.  Our server brought us our bill  -18% gratuity had been added automatically given that we were a group of 8, which I didn't mind since it saved me the trouble of figuring it out myself.  This is a good spot for lunch/dinner if you're paying with a corporate card, as the ambiance lends itself well to business lunches/dinners, but I wouldn't want to come here on a date, the food is good, but the feel is definitely corporate."}
{"text":"Coming here for Winterlicious was a great experience.  If you're using the underground path you can convienently enter from Fours Restaurant in Commerce Court. Great dining atmosphere with cozy chairs, various tiers where you can have a better perspective of the entire restaurant. Servers were very polite, and attentive.  Presentation of all three dishes were up to standards.   Starters, the fish cakes were probably the most delicious cakes I've ever had. 5/5 made from Halibut/garouper served with an ioli and winter salad greens.   Entree was the steak frites served with crispy yet delicious potatoes perfectly prepared. Steak was medium rare and served with fresh house made coleslaw.  4/5  for dessert I decided to have their Pear Tartlette!! 4/5 this dessert was ballzy! i mean blue cheese mousse ontop of this dish took the flavors to another level...the almond crumble added crunch to the dish to compliment the strong cheese.  The blueberry sauce unified everything together.  great presentation.  good job Far Niente!!  although NIENTE means NOTHING in Spanish/Italian lol..."}
{"text":"I recently organized 3 Summerlicious lunches for my office. I received so much mixed reviews from colleagues. Some enjoyed it, others loved it and others regretted what they ordered. People.  I found it very difficult to reserve a group of 6 or more people. I was told they were not taking in large groups at noon, so I split the group into 3 groups of 4 (held on different days).   I ordered the chilled chowder (which I loved), the Indian chicken (which did not sit well with me; and considering I cook Indian at home, I think it was their recipe/ingredients), and the flourless chocolate cake (which was delicious).  The server came too quickly with our bill not giving me an opportunity to request separate bills.  I don't think I will be returning here. I think I will get adventurous for the next 'Licious office lunch and aim for a restaurant a few blocks from the office."}
{"text":"ArtBabe never gets to wear heels. I'm always game for a night where a woman can wear heels, especially if it means a restaurant in the financial district on a Saturday night. It's been a long time since I've been to Far Niente. They changed their location, although they remain in the Financial District. The decor has changed too, from a lighter, urban California atmosphere to a darker, more romantic setting.   Not intending to make it a Winterlicious destination, they offered us the Winterlicious menu. There's always good value in that menu. ArtBabe and I both started with the Goat Cheese Croquette. We both agree we don't get enough goat cheese in our diets. It was quite perfect. For the mains I had the Angus steak and ArtBabe had the snapper (we had padded our selves at lunch on AYCE sushi and she was hesitant to have fish for dinner but the rest of the Winterlicious menu didn't appeal to her).   I found the steak just okay. The real surprise was the pot pie it came with. When do you really get pot pies these days? I even stopped buying them 10 years ago. It was a nice trip down memory lane and kind of retro-creative. ArtBabe thought her snapper was good.  For dessert I had the chocolate cake. Nothing to write home about although the whip cream was delightful. ArtBabe had the mango sorbet which was awesome. It was a creamy mango-y bowl of goodness.  Service is awesome.  ArtBabe thought the woman's washroom was amazing. Something about a glass sink. The men's didn't seem to have that design.  I do have to knock them down a star for trying to pat themselves on the back for \"winning\" a Wine Spectator Award of Excellence. It's quite well known these things are simply bought by restaurants (http://www.drvino.com/2008/08/19/fictitious-restaurant-wins-wine-spectator-award-of-excellence/). It's like trying to pat yourself on the back for having a quarter panel ad in Toronto Life."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious lunch. Service was super slow, it took almost 2 hours. The entrée itself took almost an hour to come after we finished the appetizers. I don't think I'll come back again solely based on these wait times.   This is what I ordered: East Coast Seafood Escabeche compressed watermelon, capers, rhubarb, tomato, chili, lemon aioli The chili really killed the salad for me. My friend and I both had the salad and ate some of the chili accidentally. It was way too spicy and clashed with the rest of the flavours in the salad.  Corn Meal Crusted Halibut chorizo-farro succotash, petit herb salad, horseradish vinaigrette The halibut was really fresh. I enjoyed this dish. The corn meal crust was perfectly done, crisp but not overly hard to chew.  Vanilla Chocolate Sundae banana chip, salted caramel, whipped cream, seasonal berries I did not like the banana chips and had to pick them off. The ice cream was average."}
{"text":"Excellent service, wonderful ambiance, average food. Located right at the northeast corner of Bay and Wellington, this is a decent option for a) people watching the suits walking by, b) enjoying a wonderfully classy, trendy ambiance, and c) appreciating fantastic service (I can't recall our server's name, but he was a gem!).   I visited on a weekday evening with friends after work, and it was relatively busy. Overall, it was a fine evening despite the food being sub-par. I ordered the Ricotta Ravioli ($24.00) and a glass of wine - note that portion size is quite small - I also had bites of the Braised Short Rib Risotto and the Roast Chicken Breast from my friends' orders, and consensus was that the food was pretty average. You're basically paying for the ambiance and location, not for truly delicious food.  However, what they lack in subpar food, they make up for in service and experience. Wonderfully friendly staff, helpful without being overly pushy. Great lighting and classy décor. Overall, it's a decent option for a meal in the Financial District for lunch or after work, particularly if you want something in the heart of your work area and you aren't willing to walk (or drive) too far. But, if your priority is delicious food over ambiance/convenience/service, I'd go elsewhere.  For one entrée and a glass of wine, I paid around $45.00."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I reserved a table of 8 for a business dinner a few weeks ago. Upon arriving, the service was friendly and charming. The table was set neatly and we were offered coat checks. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the selections offered for the night, while offering very descriptive and personal preferences on the menu for those who asked for a recommendation.   The menu was well controlled with only a few selections for appetizers and main. We started with the foie gras appetizer, which was delicate and very creative, mixing both sweet and savoury flavours. For mains, we had steak, spaghetti, roasted chicken, and swordfish. The steak was cooked to the correct temperature, the chicken was moist, and the swordfish was tender. The food definitely had impact in flavours, and the presentation was also spot on. Only thing I'd criticize is that we ordered a side order of roasted vegetables and pomme puree, which was lacking texture (hard) and slightly greasy.   Overall, I'm impressed by the flavours on some of the simpler dishes, as well as the creativity on the appetizers. They were cooked and timed well for the main ingredient to show. On top of that, service was flawless and ambience is great."}
{"text":"Another patio season has arrived!  I came up here with a friend (after being redirected from Four) to have a few drinks and snacks. They're serving Shock Top Belgian White and Stella Artois on tap.  In addition to our drinks, we ordered some menu items to snack on. We got the: - Jumbo Shrimp Cocktails, and the  - Lamb Merguez Pogo Sticks  both of which were fantastic.   The patio is pretty unsuspecting - and is a little secluded from the downtown scene, but makes for a nice place after work - as it is close to the office."}
{"text":"I ordered the warm rare ahi tuna niçois and the citrus cheese cake for lunch, and both were wonderful dishes.  Warm rare ahi tuna niçois - the dish was elegantly plated, and every element on the dish was very well seasoned and complemented each other well. The green beans were cooked perfectly, and the pomme purée worked really well with the ahi tuna. Having had niçois salads in Nice before, this dish definitely elevated the elements of a classic niçois salad to a new level. If you like olives, then I would highly recommend this dish.  The citrus cheese cake had a huge portion! It was very rich and I could taste the citrus element, which helped balance the cheese cake.  Overall, I really enjoyed the dishes and would recommend far niente if you're in the downtown core!"}
{"text":"The good, the bad & no ugly  Came here for our work Christmas luncheon, there were 7 of us. The bad: Upon arrival a few of us wanted the crab cakes but they had run out :( 3 ordered 6 oz steaks which on the small side & not cooked to order Service was good but food came out slowly even though they didn't seem that busy The so-so: 4 ordered the Mahogany Glazed Halibut - not bad I had the Waldorf salad - not bad & a few had the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail - the shrimp really were jumbo! The Good: service, decor, ambiance, comfortable seats Dessert was excellent - a colleague & I shared both the s'mores & the creme brulee, both were excellent & decadent The specialty teas all looked very good! They did discount us for the steaks that weren't too order & we appreciated that! Will give them another chance in the future or @ least return for drinks & dessert!"}
{"text":"On our trip to Toronto for Valentine's Day weekend, I decided on taking my girlfriend to a nice dinner at Far Niente.  We'd both read a few reviews, one of which was so absolutely stellar that we couldn't resist checking it out.    The minute you walk into Far Niente, you'll notice the beautiful decor.  High ceilings, white table cloths, modern architecture.  It screams commandingly, \"I'm a high class restaurant, act accordingly.\"  Luckily we were dressed nicely and my girlfriend completely owned this gorgeous new dress that put the other patrons and the setting in their place.  I wasn't quite in the mood for alcohol, but she found it easy to find a cocktail that suited her from the drink menu.  The appetizers didn't quite thrill us enough to want to order one, but in their defense, the bread was so good and this hummus dip that accompanied it was so delicious that we consumed two baskets (or maybe I consumed two baskets solo) so didn't even need to consider one.  The menu is filled with great looking items, but alas, we had to pick.  She settled on the Atlantic Salmon while I (the meat lover) the braised Canadian beef dish.  I'd never experience a Canadian cut before, so I got daring and ordered it up rare.    The dish was placed in front of me, well presented, the meat atop a mound of mashed potatoes with a few greens on the side, hers atop a bed of rice, both adequate portions.  With the first bite into mine, I realized that I was going to savor every morsel.  The beef was tender, perfectly marinated and the potatoes were whipped creamy.  I really enjoyed everything to the last fork full.  My girlfriend looked over at me and laughed at just how clean my plate was, as if just washed.  She took a photo and I still can't believe how I managed to polish it off so well.  I took a bite of her salmon which was also excellent.  She had no complaints either.  After our meal we ordered and dived into our biggest splurge to date.  Belgian Chocolate S'mores.  Although I'd wished them to be warmer, they were to die for.  You can tell they were great because I was stuffed after the main course, but still managed to fit it in.  My only negative would have to be that our service could have been much snappier.  We both allotted plenty of time to get to a show downtown, but afterwards were a bit rushed because our waited took his time.   Far Niente is a romantic spot to share a special occasion with above average food and a great atmosphere.  You can bet I'll be returning the next time I decide to visit Toronto."}
{"text":"2.5/5.   I went here for the Summerlicious lunch. Upon entering the restaurant, I was impressed at how spacious it was!   Normally for Summerlicious, I tend to pick the most expensive main course so it will worth the money lol. With that said, this time I chose the ravioli as my main since the steak will probably give me itis after lunch :(.  Overall thought: lunch was okay, but not spectacular. None of the items on their lunch menu jumped out to me as special. Since we had 12 people, there was also a service charge so our bill came to almost $40... which were probably the most expensive lunch I ever had.  -East Coast Seafood Escabeche:  The seafood was cooked perfectly, and by marinating them in vinegar and olive oil, it gave the seafood a deliciously sharp tang. The watermelon and capers toned down the tanginess of the seafood with theirs sweetness and saltiness flavors, respectively. However, I felt the chili was not needed as the dish turned out to be too spicy. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy food but the heat from the chili lingered in my mouth, and prevented me from tasting other flavors.  -Lemon Basil Ravioli:  The ravioli had a perfect ratio of fillings to dough, and I believe the filling was ricotta cheese, yum! Unfortunately there were only 2 dots of the lemon basil sauce on the plate, hence I couldn't taste the sauce at all :(. The tomato ragout was just like any other regular tomato pasta sauce that I could have made. Also, I'm not sure why there were a few pieces of candied walnuts as they didn't go well with the savory ravioli at all...   -Corn meal crusted Halibut:  Friend loved it but the halibut was overcooked. Moreover, for me anything crusted with cornmeal is pretty much tasteless, so I was expecting the sauce to deliver a big punch of flavor, but I was quite disappointed...  -Strawberry Bavarois:  I didn't get to try, but my friend seemed to enjoy it. I was quite curious of how the black pepper would go with the bavarois though  -Triple Layered Chocolate Mousse:  I ordered the mousse and it was not overly sweetened, however it wasn't bad nor awful. The mousse itself had a dense texture and strong chocolate flavor. The first layer was jello or something, I just can't quite put my finger on it but it was good! The top layer was tangy and really helped to cut down the rich chocolate mousse."}
{"text":"I had lunch there yesterday with three colleagues.  I ordered the Tandoori Chicken (Jasmine rice, chickpea salad, cucumber mint yogurt).  Our meals arrived about 5 minutes after we ordered them ... seriously.  I guess that's the benefit of having a small menu.  My chicken and rice were okay ... not bad, not great.  I would have expected something a little more exciting and tastier considering the restaurant and the price ($23).  The service was great ... there was always someone handy to ensure our glasses were filled with sparkling water."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. I should've prepared myself for an underwhelming experience when the waiter didn't ask how I wanted my steak done.  (For the record, they brought it medium. It was chewy.)"}
{"text":"I think we were the first and only people in the place! lol Went on a Friday at 5pm, watched a lot of cold people running to Union Station. Still booked on OpenTable to get the points.  Was just us in the place, and our server was attentive as a result. Loved their warm bread, but were a bit chintzy on the butter. I was the only one drinking, Patti was driving so she just had tea. So i ordered a half bottle of pinot grigio which was super tasty.  I had two apps because I'm a fatty.... the caesar salad was great, i loved the boar bacon. also had the scallops with banana pepper slaw, both of which were awesome. Scallops were perfectly cooked.  I had the 10oz steak which was cooked to order and had enough to bring home for steak and eggs the next morning! Had a big ol' glass of Pinot Noir as well with the steak which paired nicely.  Warm apple crumble for dessert!  Great way to start my birthday weekend!"}
{"text":"Ditto what Richie said - Good, yet not memorable.   This place is perfect for a business lunch, which is exactly what I was there for. Otherwise, the decor and ambiance is just very professional but pretty boring looking.  I disagree that this is a romantic date spot - please, no. Mike P, take your girlfriend/wife somewhere with a little personality.   I tried the Arctic Char, colleagues picked the salmon and the Cobb Salad. Everyone really enjoyed the food. It was tasty but didn't blow my mind or anything. Service was excellent.   It's pricey, it was about $50 each after tax and tip for lunch, and we didn't even have appetizers. Just coffee, a main, and one person had a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 20 and we booked in advance to make sure they could accommodate all of us. Imagine our surprise when it was pretty much empty when we arrived for dinner. It wasn't a big deal but I just thought it was weird that there weren't that many people.   Service was quite slow given that there were very few other people at the restaurant. I felt like only one waitress was working all of the tables. She was friendly but it took a lot of time for each course to come out.   The wine list was okay, but I noticed some sort of precipitate at the bottom of my glass so I sent it back and the waitress was very nice about it and offered to replace it.   Since we had such a large group we had pre-selected a fixed menu and most people ended up choosing the steak. It was really average, we were in good company and went through several bottles of wine which saved the night but otherwise the restaurant was just okay for us."}
{"text":"The food here is terrific and the ambiance is very romantic at night.  The crowd during the day is dominated by bay street bankers and other businessmen, but on weekends it is a little more down to earth.  I love coming here for Birthdays and special occasions.  Their chicken pot pie (only offered at lunch) is to die for, and their lobster pot pie is amazing for dinner.  Unlike other trendy upscale restaurants in the surrounding financial district, the portions here are very generous."}
{"text":"We always enjoy dining at Far Niente.  The ambiance is very nice - a quiet classy place with a view of downtown streets - and the service is always great.    The times I've been there, I've opted for the fish dishes - The miso glazed pickerel, the atlantic salmon with yukon potato hash and the mohogany glazed halibut.  They've been good, but not as flavourful as the dishes my wife has had.  The wild mushroom risoto was incredible as was the ricotta ravioli.    Highly recommend the FN chocolate smores for dessert."}
{"text":"I have only been here once and was in a rush because we on are way to a concert. The wait staff was stellar and made sure we were done on time. The food was fine. I  had seafood pasta, another person at my table had the steak and frites with aioli whipped by angels. The steak was much better. Get the steak. Mmmmm. Steak."}
