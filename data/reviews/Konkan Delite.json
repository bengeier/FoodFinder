{"text":"We went to have lunch and were disappointed to find the menu did not have any Konkani items. After asking the chef mentioned that they can make it for us. They only had couple of options available. We ended up compromising with sannas, chicken sukka and prawn curry with rice. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"If you've been searching for some authentic Goan food this might be just the place for you. This is a relatively new place and I have never seen it very crowded. The food is homestyle Goan and Mangalorean food. They serve Sorpotel, a pork dish of Portuguese origin cooked in the coastal Konkan (western) region of India, primarily Goa and Mangalore.  They also have a great mutton dish and sannas (a steamed puffy rice flour cake).   I brought home a bottle of their prawn pickle in Indian curry and it was an instant hit. The owner is very friendly and a great host. It's a bit of a trek from downtown but worth it if you are a fan of goan food."}
{"text":"I tried this food on the weekend. Wow.. All I can say is the food is so bland.. I know GOAN food well and grew up on it as a kid. This food is nothing compared to the dish's I have tried from family and friends. I had the beef cutlets they had no taste..no chili, no garlic or ginger or goan vinegar in the meat. Yuck.. The chicken biryani was okay.. But again the chicken was not in a gravy and dry.. The best part of the rice was the raisins.. I will never go back"}
