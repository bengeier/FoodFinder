{"text":"Server is rude and not paying attention. Have to come back and verified our orders.  Salmon is over-cooked and dried.  Menus are overpriced for the quality of food.  However, the steak was done perfectly to medium."}
{"text":"Nice, family environment that I've been to a few times. Great French toast, but rubbery scrambled eggs. Ordered over-medium once and received over easy, which was unappetising and went uneaten"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and great service!  The Italian omelette was so tasty.  Fast service and a smile.  Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"my go to breakfast place.  great atmosphere, awesome food and great friendly service... if you like all day breakfast's, go to the valley, you won't be dissappointed!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here last week for the first time. Great family owned restaurant! The food was yummy, fresh and plentiful. It's a great little place to have a quiet meal."}
{"text":"Great place,great food,never disappointed and the price is cheap.

Always treated like family and service is fast and friendly

But yes the place gets packed on the weekend,but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Homey atmosphere, good service, good food, good value for your money.
Warning: This place fills up quickly....either get there real early or go after the breakfast rush which is around 10 am.  There was a
line coming out the door this morning.

Also, parking can be an issue as the lot is not that spacious and sometimes it gets so busy, you have to make your own spot if there is room to do so.

Kid friendly....lots of families, lots of regulars.  We've been three times so far and will definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"Wanted to find a good place for eggs Benedict. Saw Valley Fields on yelp and thought we'd give it a try. It was absolutely delicious! I would recommed either the smoked salmon and asparagus or the veggie Benedict. Both very flavourful! I'm not sure about the rest of the breakfasts but if you're in the mood for eggs Benedict it's a good choice to dine here.

Great service, amazing food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service!
Fantastic food! 
Quick service! 

I just literally finished eating here. Couldn't wait to do this review. I had the Harvest Special. 3 eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, home fries, toast and pancakes. Obviously I couldn't finish it all but I tried really hard cause it was so good. 

The home fries are beyond words. Potatoes and bacon bits done to golden perfection. The sausages were delicious. My sunny side up eggs were perfect  Basically, come here for brunch. You will not be disappointed. :)

Our waitress was great. She was fast and came and checked up on us on a regular. Refilled my coffee. Brought us water without us asking.

This place is a hidden treasure that I am happy my friend found. Coming back here again soon!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast. Eggs Benedict is really good. Hollandaise sauce made the proper way. A must drop by place when in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Good food but very pricey, All around the city chicken souvlaki dinner would cost you $10-$12, here it's about $17, I work near by it's not somewhere I would eat lunch at everyday, a once in a while treat.. :) Nonetheless the food is good price ridiculous"}
{"text":"We live downtown and it's hard to find a breakfast place with a  small town feel. We will make the drive out here again for the atmosphere and delicious food."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with friendly, attentive staff and a warm, welcoming environment. My partner and I ordered the salmon Benedict and western omelette.  The food was very good with large portions. Highly recommended. Our server, Angela was excellent!"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here for breakfast.  The omelette' are excellent and the portions will fill even the heartiest of foodies."}
{"text":"Best breakfast around.  Large portions, friendly owners all at a great price.  $10 for 3 eggs, bacon, home fries, toast and coffee."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time.  Hard to find good Mom & Pop shops these days.  Great food, great prices and great service!  The food is always fresh and prepared just right.  The breakfast is awesome, as is the rest of the menu.  The owner is always around and makes everyone feel right at home.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Super friendly family owned restaurant with delicious food. I had the smoked salmon and asparagus eggs benny - the portion was huge and there was a lot of home fries included.The poached egg was perfectly made although I wish the home fries were a little crispier but overall the food was great!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good proportion. 
Must try."}
{"text":"It's family day and there are limited options uptown. I'd passed by this restaurant before and always wanted to try it, and since it was open, today was the day. Well it was just okay. The eggs and bacon were tasty, however the pancakes and French toast left something to be desired and weren't worth the calories. It was bland and inspired. We let them know we weren't going to eat the pancakes, and were basically told they wouldn't be replaced and we'd have to pay for another dish if we wanted something else. So we settled up and left. Friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful brunch here and the food was great!!! Homemade hash browns will keep me coming back for more. The service was prompt and professional."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times for breakfast food and its pretty good. They have plenty of tables for a small restaurant and the wait staff are pretty quick on service.  
Tried the steak and eggs, Reuben sandwich, and eggs benedict. However my go-to meal is the eggs benedict.  
Food - 4 stars, food is very tasty. Well seasoned. For the eggs benedict, the hollandaise is creamy and smooth with just the right amount of tang. The homefries have nice crispy bits and nothing is over cooked. The eggs have a good runny yolk. The only thing i would say is that the breakfast dishes could use a little fruit or something on the side, giving  this place that competitive edge.
Service - 5 stars, service has always been nice. They greet and check on the customers frequently which is good to see. And the food comes out quickly.  
Overall - 4 stars. This place is definitely a great breakfast place, but if your looking to be wowed its not something that stands out."}
{"text":"Family friendly environment, hollandaise sauce on their egg benedicts is amaaaaaaaazing
 compared to some I've had previously. Enough said :D 
Just can't give a five star unless it's zagat restaurant"}
{"text":"Went there a few days ago for breakfast. I had chicken breast, eggs and their home made potatoes. Nothing special. 

The service was slow but that's because a big group came and they only had 2 servers running the show. 

Not sure if I would go back. It was just an okay experience."}
{"text":"This little hidden gem. So I came here with my bf right after training for 2 hours at the gym and doing legs late one morning. Needless to say I was a hungry hungry hippo. The place is small-ish but not crammed. There was a small line up at the door but we got seated in no time.

My friend orders a main. I ordered the egg Benedict and the french toast. The waitress advises me that their portion sizes are pretty generous and boy was she right. Despite her caution I ordered myself 2 plates - she was certain I couldn't finish it.

I polished off both to her surprise when she returned. Yes I was hungry but the food was fantastic!!! There was a gentleman who was presumably the manager that walked around and made sure everyone was enjoying there food. Price was reasonable as well.

I will definitely go back. If this place was any closer to my house I would be there every day! Thanks for the great food and wonderful services guys!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my family.. Was a bit of a line up on a rainy Sunday morning.   

Service is a bit a slow but friendly.  
Coffee was strong and tasted great. 

I got the veggiterian eggs Benedict it was OK.
Side potato was fantastic and the portions were generous. 

I was generally pleased...  More of a 3.5 star place.  

Not sure if I would want to return.   Not that it is a bad place,  it is nothing special."}
{"text":"...love this mom and pops place! the staff is quite friendly and the owner always greets us personally whenever he's around. i have personally only ever ordered from their all day breakfast menu so i can't speak for their lunch and dinner but it is the best breakfast at the most decent price. 

while i have ordered many breakfast dishes, my favorite go-to is the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and asparagus. i must have had this dish once a week for the past year and it's been cooked to perfection every time. the sauce is not too heavy, not too light. the eggs are always made the way you like it - i make sure i get them to soft poach them. home fries are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

weekend mornings and brunch time get pretty busy but it is always worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  Good price and the portions of food were great.  Location is easy the find.  Will go again"}
{"text":"My close to home greasy spoon I go to on Sunday mornings when I'm hung over. I love their cheapy breakfast, especially the hash browns. Portions are big and you never wait long to be served!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and wonderful staff.  Beautiful place and fast service. Thank you for the free fruit bowl.. For the bride to be was sweet of you  #wewillbeback"}
{"text":"This place is worth the Hype!!! Valleyfields Breakfast is so friggin good!! We got here and waited in line for about 15 minutes. The place was super busy on a Sunday and the Line did not stop. Definitely a great sign when people are lining up AND are all patient and polite at the same time! It just seemed like EVERYONE knew this food was worth the wait!!! And It definitely IS!!! I ordered the Canadian Omelette that came with home fries and toast. They did not cheap out on the ingredients and the omelette was stuffed with sausage, peameal bacon, ham, and cheddar cheese. The home fries were delicious and everything was made with tons of love.

My gf ordered the Harvest Breakfast with Pancakes and they were all superb! The service was quick, efficient, and servers were really friendly! Even though they were super busy, you could never really see it on the servers faces.

I will definitely be coming back here and bringing all of my friends after a super fun night of partying to help our cure our hangovers. Hahaha!"}
{"text":"I decided to grab a quick breakfast here based on Yelp reviews.  I ordered the Harvest Special along with a greek salad.  Overall, the food was average, nothing special. However, the portions are large for the price you pay."}
{"text":"My boyfriend found this place from Yelp after a night of drinking and we were craving a good breakfast. There was a bit of a wait before being seated, but after that we were served promptly with very little wait time to receive our food. I ordered the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and asparagus, and my boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs. Both plates came with three eggs and home fries. The eggs benedict was amazing! It was so good that I didn't want to share with my boyfriend (I did in the end)! My boyfriend liked his steak and eggs, but I think we can both agree that my dish was better! The potatoes were ok, but you can't really mess that up. 

My boyfriend usually prefers Cora's for breakfast (he's a waffle guy) but he did not complain about this place. I guess that means we'll be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to come here for brunch one day after driving by this restaurant on the way to the gym. I think this may be my regular go to breakfast place. Everything about this place met all my expectations: great service, wonderful ambience, and delicious food. We got here around 11:30AM and it was packed with a lineup at the door. Usually when a restaurant has a lineup, it's a good sign. We waited about 15 minutes before sitting down. The server immediately greeted us with a smile and gave us our menus asking what we wanted to drink. My boyfriend ordered the omelette breakfast and I opted for the breakfast special (with eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, toast, home fried potatoes and pancakes). Each portion was massive and well worth the money. It truly tasted like a homecooked meal because everything was delicious and made with love. I was thoroughly impressed with the potatoes and most of all the pancakes, so fresh and fluffy! 

They have great breakfast specials so you could easily get a combo for $8 or less. Great brunch place, will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Very cute. We went on a Sunday at brunch time (10:30-11am) - it was busy but not over crowded. We were sat immediately and got our drinks fast as well. Looks like it's family owned and the food was very good. 
Boyfriend got the eggs and steak. He's eating healthy so he got sliced tomato on the side. Waitress asked how he wanted his steak, he said medium, when it came it was definitely well done.
I had the veggie eggs benedict. It was really good. I'm picky about hollendaise sauce and this was creamy and thick. I also enjoyed the potatoes on the side. 
Seating was very comfortable. Everyone looked as if they felt at home here. I definitely think this spot has its regulars as the waitress was joking with people seated around us. 
Overall, a mid priced lovely brunch spot. Would go back!"}
{"text":"What an amazing find in North York. It's certainly not a hidden gem, as it is quite a well known spot, but we found this place by complete accident. For some reason, this usually busy joint was not that busy on the day and we got a table immediately. 
The servers were nice....can't complain, casual atmosphere, not to roomy layout but not too jam packed either. 

The good part was certainly the food. I went with the good ol' benny, and it did not disappoint. The Hollandaise sauce on the benny was just about perfect. One of the better tasting hollandaise I've had in Toronto. Two muffins, with three poached eggs on top, generous peameal bacon, and Hollandaise. They didn't drown the dish in the rich sauce, which was nice too. Not to leave behind the hash, which could hold its own against any benny on the other half of the plate. Really, really good hash!

The other dish we tried was a super indulgence. Can't remember its name, will update this review with the name after our next visit. The breakfast dish had the same amazing hash, with some delicious sausages tossed along, generous amounts of gravy, and eggs on top cooked as per your liking. Well....lets call it a breakfast poutine. Seriously doubt anyone can finish this super rich dish in one sitting. Delicious?...... definitely, healthy?...... yea right

Glad to find this really good breakfast place in North York, I think its right up there with the very best in Toronto."}
{"text":"A great all purpose family style diner. Very popular with locals in the area and is always busy on weekends for breakfast.  Large portions so go hungry!  Prices are reasonable and the waitresses are always friendly.  Their souvlaki is great as well as their breakfasts."}
{"text":"I was inspired by KL to come and eat here. Though I enjoy salmon, I have never had smoked salmon before. It was a huge hit. I have been to this restaurant over half a dozen times, and that's all I get. Hollandaise sauce made perfect every time. I have only one incident, where I found a shell in one of the eggs. The wonderful waitress immediately apologized and removed the coffee off the bill. Coffee was terrible but the food was amazing."}
{"text":"No change to my previous 5-star rating, I just wanted to add a mention for the Halloumi Breakfast special that I tried recently.
It's not something that I have had anywhere else, but it looked interesting on the menu, so I gave it a try... and was very good! The slices of cheese are grilled, so it has the slightest stiffness to it, but a nice change from the usual breakfast fare. It came with 3 eggs and toast and home fries for $11 (plus coffee + tax). Definitely something to try if you visit."}
{"text":"I used to come for breakfast on the weekends regularly about 5 years ago and remember huge portions, tasty food, and great service. 

I've recently moved back to the area and visited Valley Fields for breakfast last Saturday - and i was so happy to see that it hasn't changed! Still the same great portions, tasty food, and familiar smiling faces. 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great portion sizes, attentive staff and reasonable prices. Has the Salmon eggs Benedict followed by a fruit bowl. Satisfied to say the least"}
{"text":"First off, the manager/host was very friendly! I had called in to see if they were open on Family Day and he remembered me when we arrived!
(I just downloaded Yelp and this is my first review - I had to write down this experience somewhere) The wait for a table for two was almost instant. I got Eggs Benedict with salmon and asparagus while my partner got the Breakfast Feast.The portions of food were great for it's price and coffee had free refills! However, I must warn you: if you and your friends get home fries - it's A LOT. Next time, we'll substitute one of ours for tomatoes or something else.
Overall, it was a great brunch place just off the DVP. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food clean place  good breakfast. I did like aloe and I will go there again  Greek Resturant always best"}
{"text":"I love this place for brunch on weekends! Been here many times sometimes with just my husband and sometimes with family. Service doesn't change, always excellent! Very nice and courteous staff. Oftentimes there's a line up but we've never waited more than 10 minutes. My absolute favourite that I order all the time is their smoke salmon eggs Benedict with asparagus! If you're looking for a family-owned restaurant that has delicious food, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Came here today in search of the legendary eggs and bacon breakfast.   Was happy to get a spot immediately even though there was a line up.  Was greeted really nicely and the service was extremely fast and proficient.  Everything was perfect and not too greasy.  I had the breakfast combo which was only 6.99 which had a pretty good serving size."}
{"text":"Best EGGS BENNY in the city! 

You wana know why I come here? Amazing food, outstanding & quick service, warm atmosphere, great management, and everyone I've brought here has been pleased by how great of a restaurant this is overall. 

I've been coming here for years. It's not just about food. It's not just about setting. It's not just about service or price. It's about how all these factors beautifully and effortlessly come together to create a wonderful and enjoyable time...every time! This is what Valley Fields Restaurant is about and this is why I keep coming back. 

Thank you to the Valley Fields team for treating me like family every time I come in. It truly is a pleasure and I have become a lifelong customer :) See you soon!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing.

We've stopped by Valley Fields at least once a week for the past few months. The food is superb & the waitresses are some of the friendliest we've ever had.

Huge portions, amazing prices. We can barely ever finish our entire plate. Everything is fresh & made to perfection.

The ONLY negative part of this restaurant is the wait times; expect to wait around for a table upwards twenty minutes if you come during rush times."}
{"text":"Solid old-school restaurant.  The food is what you expect in a older family style restaurant.  The food is pretty good...but not amazing.  The atmosphere is quite old and the service is fine.  Their breakfast is good.  A restaurant frequented by the locals."}
{"text":"My boyfriends friend took us to this joint for my belated bday brunch. We came around 11ish and there was a line up already! They don't take numbers but they'll take your name and you'll be seated based on a first come first served basis. We were seated 15 minutes later. 

Our server took our drinks order first so that we can have a few more minutes to decide what to order when she returned. I decided to order the Harvest Special because I want pancakes in addition to the meat and eggs. It includes two pancakes, three eggs any style but I wanted them scrambled, two ham, two sausages, two bacon and home fries! My boyfriend ordered the Eggs Benedict with Peameal bacon, home fries and brown toast. His friends orders the Western and Italian omelettes! 

It took awhile before our food came but it built up my appetite to eat even more! When our food arrived my dish was massive! I enjoyed my fresh pancakes! My eggs and meat were delicious! A very classic diner style breakfast! My boyfriends eggs Benedict were amazing as well! The eggs were so runny that we could soak up the English muffin and there would still be leftover yolk! The home fries were amazing as well! We tried the omelettes and they were tasty! I would order it the next time I return!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great portion size. But that's all that is good. My husband and I barely touched our food. Too oily, too much calories, and was just not good.  I am a bit confused why this place have such great rating. Maybe we didn't order the right thing, but I don't think we will be back give it a another try.."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It is exactly two seconds from my office and I always get take away, however I have dined in before. I've gotten the eggs Benedict, the club sandwich and the eggs and bacon and all have really good. The service is quick and friendly too, the only thing is that they close at 3pm and sometimes I don't have time to go for lunch before then. Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"Very warm and welcoming restaurant. Food is great, and they have their own signature stands out from the chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Well I took trip to valley fields today as I read great reviews. Dinner was alright . Breakfast was good but as I finished my my meal the server came over and asked if we wanted dessert so I ordered bread pudding with rum sauce, as I get half way threw a notice something sticking out the edge so to my surprise I find the bread tag baked into the pudding. So the manager comes an said sorry its cuz we used real bread and he still charged us for the dessert. I have to say not impressed and will not ever go back........."}
{"text":"This place is terrible!

I am ashamed to have eaten here. Just finished and I feel sick to my stomach. We were really hungry & it's shocking the krap one puts in their body when they are really hungry. 

The food was so greasy and sickening. 

The waitress was nice. But the owner what a D-bag! He knows nothing of customer service. I complained to him about the meal. He turns to our waitress, who's cashing me out and says, \"How many people have we served today? \" They answer in unison, but; also him more predominately, \"300\". Then he adds, \"and this is the first complaint\". Clearly he doesn't take to complaints very often or very well. He didn't offer any reduction in price at all for our meals. I would need to have asked him and given his attitude toward me already, I didn't even bother. 

I'm surprised his business continues to operate.

I will not venture here again and good luck to those who do.

The pictures weren't even worth taking but I did anyway."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great atmosphere, friendly servers, and excellent foods. If you are planning to visit this place, try their eggs bennies and homemade burgers. They r great!"}
{"text":"Still not sure how they mastered my favourite brunch dish so easily...

Arrived a bit after noon and was seated shortly. The place was definitely packed. The adorable and welcoming interior gave it away that it's a cute family owned restaurant. 

Got the eggs benny (of course...) with smoked salmon. I wasn't expecting much despite the amazing Yelp reviews. I have high standards for my bennies..and honestly the photos of the bennies didn't look AMAZING. 

So...
The hollandaise sauce was creamy, tasty, and wasn't too much to the point where I felt heavy after eating half of my food.
The eggs were perfectly cooked.
The english muffin was soft and crispy...love it.
You can never go wrong with smoked salmon.
And the potatos were good too.

Coffee was also pretty amazing.

Tried my friend's Canadian Omelette..yum! Lots of meat in it.

Although far, I think I've found my favourite brunch place for now."}
{"text":"Great little brunch spot! Traditional home fries, crispy bacon and perfectly cooked eggs."}
{"text":"I and my husband have different views on this place which we've seen numerous times on our visit to a couple other places when we're in that part of Toronto. While my food was great and I thought the seats were extremely comfortable (we were in a booth), my husband found the booth uncomfortable and the food just pretty good. However, we both felt that the food was served quickly and felt as if they had known us forever, even though it was probably our first time there. In general, I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite local, independent greasy spoon restaurants. Very warm and comforting. The food is delicious."}
{"text":"Came here with the family on Sunday for brunch. I was unimpressed by the service. People came in after us and got a seat before us because they seemed familiar with the hostess or owner. We ended up waiting another 10 minutes for a seat to open up since the place was packed. 

The people sitting beside us came after us and were asked about their orders first. We had to wait another 5 minutes before we could order.

The food was mediocre. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Huge portions! Absolutely delicious. You definitely get what you pay for. Small family owned and operated. Will be going back for more.

Phenomenal eggs benny - the english muffin was crispy on the outside soft on the inside. Amazing hollandaise sauce. Asparagus and smoked salmon perfect accompaniments.

Service was very fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast choice if you're in that area. Got the usual traditional goodies. My friends really enjoyed the salmon eggs benedict $12.50 and the salmon plate $12.50. Where I got traditional with the harvest special $12.00. Affordable and homey. Good food. great service. Unlimited coffee $2

It looks as though they get a lot of turnover so weekend brunches are pretty busy. Can't say anything bad about this  place. Sausage was pretty oily but whatever, just soak it up with a napkin."}
{"text":"Valleyfields is my go to breakfast joint. The service is always friendly and quick. The portions are generous for the price and the food is always awesome ."}
{"text":"Despite the overall good rating, I found it nothing near what other Yelpers experienced that Sunday morning. My first time at this restaurant is frankly going to be my last.

My wife and I made the decision to try out a new brunch spot and we came across Valley Fields Restaurant. Not too far from the DVP with plenty of parking. As soon as we opened the door, we were greeted by a disgusting waft of dirty washroom mixed with what I think was cleaning supplies. For some reason, I still thought it was a good idea to still eat here, probably because of the Yelp reviews and the amount of people sitting inside. Did they not smell what I smelt?

There's a sign propped at the front that clearly says \"Please seat yourselves,\" and as we were making our way to an empty table, we were told by one of the waitresses to, \"Wait a couple minutes.\" It felt like forever until she then directed us to a table that someone just left, when there were clearly 2-3 empty tables available. A quick wipe of the towel was enough for her to think that the table was clean, but there were still, what I think, was jam and some white... substance along the edge of the table trim.

We really hoped the food would make up for all this.

We really did.

We both ordered the Valley Fields plate that included 2 sausages, 2 slices of ham, 2 slices of peameal bacon, 3 eggs, and toast. We got our food and look at one of my slices of ham. A chunk of it was missing... I mean... really? My scrambled eggs were still runny, the bacon was rubbery...

I asked for the bill and the machine, despite not complaining because I felt kind of sad for the place, and when I pulled out my credit card, the waitress just yanked it from me. Apparently, they still don't have wireless POS pads and are printing out receipts customers need to fill in the tip.

I hate to say it, but this is probably one of the worst brunch spots I've been to."}
{"text":"The breakfast was great both times I ate here. The first time I got eggs Benny as suggested by our friendly waitress. They were great, as expected. The potatoes were slightly soft and under seasoned for my liking. My friend got steak and eggs but wasn't a fan. The second time I came I got the meal w pancakes eggs bacon and sausage (I forget the menu name) and it was great but I had to take half of it home. Hit the spot tho! I couldn't help but order pancakes.. I usually don't but the place smelled like them so I had to. Anyway, it's now easily one of my favourite local breakfast joints because it's an authentic diner with a cozy feel and the food is good."}
{"text":"Nice cozy greasy spoon environment.  Don't trust your gps though it takes you too Far East.  Just look for the. Tim Hortons it is in the plaza across the street nestled in  the corner.  
Fast friendly service.  Great portion and breakfast special was perfect with real not greasy home tries. Good coffee!  Will go again when in the area."}
{"text":"Great lil place with a nice breakfast menu.. had pemeal and eggs over easy. Everything was amazing. Wifey had steak and eggs and she loved it too. Would definitely return when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Hum.  In the past yelpers have never steered me wrong but I can't say I loved this place.  It's like an old time diner kind of atmosphere.  The clientele in there were quite elderly.  The waitress was pretty good.  We had chicken souvlaki but everything my hubby tried to order they were out of.  This was kind of annoying.  Prices were ok and portion size was alright.  Not sure if we'll go back."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times with 3-6 people at a time. Today we had the Ham Eggs Benedict and the Salmon & Asparagus Eggs Benedict. Their hollandaise sauce is absolutely perfect in my opinion. It's light in taste and not overly salty either, it's just right. Also, they know the meaning of what a poached egg should be!

The service is and always is excellent. I believe the restaurant is family owned, and the waitresses are all very nice ladies with very good customer service skills. 

Highly recommend this place for brunch food!  

FYI: they are only OPEN 7am to 3pm Monday to Sunday."}
{"text":"We went here on Sunday because of the high reviews for a breakfast place.  As we parked we noticed that the restaurant from the outside does not look modern like a Cora's or Eggsmart.  We waited behind two people because the place was filled, however we didn't have to wait too long and we were seated at a comfy booth.  Inside has more of a homestyle dinner look.  We ordered the Eggs benedict with smoked salmon and asked for spinach instead of asparagus.  
We received our food within reasonable time and I must say the Eggs benedict was great!  The hollandaise sauce was creamy and not salty.  The eggs were perfectly poached and combination of flavors was delicious!"}
{"text":"I was searching for a restaurant open on New Year's Day...Stumbled across this place on Yelp and we decided to give it a try. We waited about 15 minutes for a table.
I ordered the veggie eggs Benedict and it was absolutely delicious. The hollandaise sauce was made perfectly and the servings were large... I barely got through the eggs Benedict and still had a full side of home fries! Service was quick, staff was friendly and food was delicious. I will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"I just heard about this place thought I'd give it a try. Family place with friendly staff. I ordered the soup of the day (beef macaroni) for the baby she loved it and so did I.  I ordered the breakfast poutine which was home fries covered in cut up breakfast sausage cheese and gravy with 2 eggs any style on the top.  Huge portion and amazing tasting.  Prices are a little higher then my regular breakfast spot. One downfall is they do not have a change table for baby which is odd considering its a family place"}
{"text":"Very satisfying brunch.  Food was good, atmosphere warm and cozy, the staff very nice.

I had the smoked salmon Benny.  Excellent and light hollandaise sauce.  My wife had the traditional breakfast, and the pemeal bacon was great, not too greasy."}
