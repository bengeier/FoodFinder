{"text":"I took my mom here for her birthday over the summer and she loved it! The interior was a little \"over the top\" with all the pink decor and bows, but we enjoyed that, since we really wanted her to have that \"cute\" tea party experience. The different teapots and cups provided for each person were beautiful and unique.

They had lots of teas for you to choose from and the serving sizes of the afternoon tea set was more than enough. We all ordered a portion for ourselves and ended up with lots of leftovers, as the scones were so filling! I would recommend getting 1 set to share for 2 and you can always add on an additional teapot. 

Overall, it was a nice spot to hang out and I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I was here a while ago. I am sad to hear that they closed. I  found the tea sets, tea, and food very scrumptious."}
{"text":"Went with my friends, one has a gluten intolerance. The tea room has a gluten free menu, which my friend said was excellent. The service is great and the petit fours this time were fresh! A nice treat without going all the way downtown for high tea."}

On the left is a fireplace flanked by 2 wing chairs anchored around and antique small round table. The decor is fussy and very Victorian.

The lady
\"Oh this is very charming\"
Her male companion
\"Nice, but let's look at the menu\"

The couple is seated at a small round table that is nicely adorned with a teapot and the wherewithal to make tea.

The gentleman
\"mmmm all kinds of tea here....the English Afternoon Tea and English High Tea are sort of pricey\"
The lady
\"Not more than one would pay elsewhere, and the tiered trays I see look yummy\"
The gentleman
\"Being here is a bit odd for a male\"
The lady
\"Look there is another one there!, what to you feel like having?\"
The gentleman
\"Well we just ate so I think I will stick to tea, and what will you have?\"
The lady
\"I think I will have a green tea, and why don't we share an order of scones with Devon Cream and jam\"
The gentleman
\"I have not had a good chai for ages. I used to make them at home in the old days. I like the idea of sharing the scones\"

The teas are delivered promptly in an appropriately scaled teapot and are accompanied by 2 scones, devon cream, and jam all set on a decorated plate.

The gentleman
\"I did not remember scones being this crumbly but they are good\"
The lady
\"You are thinking of something else perhaps. These are very good\"
The gentleman
\"The Devon cream is a little on the light side, but pretty tasty, and my chai is just right\"
The lady
\"I just love the jam and its consistency\"

The tea room attendant reappears and offers to refill the teapots with water.
The gentleman
\"Thank you very much that would be nice\"

The lady and gentleman both sit and sit doing some people watching. The gaze at a reproduction on the wall. they appear perplexed.

The gentleman
\"There is something wrong in the way the colour of the carpet changes in the light, on this picture. The shadows are not consistent\"
The lady
\"How did you notice that...but you are right\"

A few minutes later a waiter presents the bill and the painting is discussed in hushed tones.

The lady and gentleman get ready to leave and head for the front door.

Food: 3.5/5
Service: 5/5
Location: 4.5/5
I chose to come to this tea room for my birthday with my two best friends. It really is a hidden gem (hidden away in Old Thornhill). It was around $25 per afternoon tea setting and we made the mistake of each getting a set - it was definitely way too much food. One order for a party of two is perfect. 
The assortment of teas available was impressive, everything from floral and fruity teas, to a big variety of green teas and traditional black teas. All the little details of this place made my experience fantastic. The pretty china used, the colourful tea pots, and of course the three-tiered display. The top level held delicate desserts, the middle layer had cold finger sandwiches, and of course scones on the bottom layer. I would suggest eating the scones first when they're still nice and hot. Over all the food was delicious (nothing exceptional), but the attention to detail was what impressed me the most.
The service was fantastic, as the server was very attentive, but gave us our space. The location is small and adorably furnished. With pink and lace and kitschy florals everywhere, this is a great place for an intimate afternoon tea session with friends and loved ones. Parking in a small back lot off Yonge St., keep a careful eye out for it as you approach or you just might miss the tiny driveway opening."}
{"text":"Came here with a small group of friends who wanted to do high tea. I had never been before but this experience has made me a fan. I do wish there was more of a demo for those who were as inexperienced as I was, but we still had a blast.

Staff: They were really friendly and answered questions any time we had any. My only suggestion to them would be that it was a little disorganized when we got our tea because the staff prepared and brought our tea one at a time, instead of prepping all teas and then bringing the tea out all at once. As I mentioned, we're left to our own devices and so there was a hilarious moment between all of us where we poured the tea into the cup but we didn't realize there were tea leaves strainers that came soon after. Needless to say we had tea leaves in our cups and bursted out laughing when we realized our rookie mistake.

Ambience: It is a cute little place. We were the only one there for the afternoon. I will say that you could easily miss the parking entrance in between two buildings, and we ended up driving in a circle twice before we were successful. Their china was beautiful and each one person had a different unique set which made it even cooler to me. One thing that I couldn't help notice was that they had some architectural elements that seemed incomplete but I only noticed it because I'm weird like that.

Food: We all got the high tea option. I ordered the Tropical Delight tea which was really good and went well with the food. I started with the Chicken Salad and there were little pieces of pears that made it extra delicious. Next was the beautiful rack of sandwiches, scones and selection of petit four. The sandwich bread was a bit on the drier side, but the sandwiches were mighty delicious. The scones were amazing and they mentioned that they made them in-house. They were probably made with a lot of butter because they were so loose and soft but had that nice bake on the outside; they were pure perfection! I will say that I didn't care too much about the petit four selection, they were bit-sized dessert bites but they weren't flavourful and they were too hard for my preference.

This place made me want to try high tea again! This place offered great dining experience and their scones were amazing!"}
{"text":"5/5 ! Had a excellent experience at Victorian Tea Room. I want to come here for my birthday every year!! :) 

We had the high tea experience & it was just amazing !! I imagine it would be quite busy during the summer months & reservations would definitely be needed. So nice to have tea and not have to spend an arm and leg like in dt Toronto. 

Service was excellent. Travis our server asked us how everything was a couple times and gave really good recommendations (we had to select our tea and salad). We learned it was a family business which started a year and a half ago. When you step in, you do get a old english feel. It's nice there were armchairs in a corner area where u can take photos for fun! 

Love the large assortment of teas (esp fruity flavoured). We each got our own pot of tea (approx. 1.2L). The teapots were all different with floral designs on them. For the salads, we picked the spinach and arugula salad. They were delicious w/ a little sweetness. The strawberries (spinach salad) & pears (arugula salad) were so fresh! 

Everything else was served on a three tier stand. The scones were baked fresh on site and it was DELICIOUS. The best I've ever had. Eat those first! The outside was slightly crunchy and inside was soft and served toasty warm! So good! Loved the cream and jam that it came with. In the past, I was never a scones fan as the ones I've been accustomed to eating were always hard. Victorian Tea Room scones have changed it all for me now! Sandwiches were nice also. It consisted of tuna, egg, salmon/cream cheese & cucumber. Not that big a fan of the petit fours. They reminded me of the Chinese desserts at buffets except they were extra sweet. I usually have a high tolerance for sweetness but it was too much for me (yet I ate it all anyway). The sorbet w/ blueberries, strawberries were excellent. Again, the fruits were so fresh.

I would definitely be coming back again w/ friends and for my next bday! ^^

Prices for High Tea 
$30 (Tues - Fri), $35 (Sat - Sun)

The parking lot is at the back and there was lots of space. Entrance to parking is on Yonge (just to the right of Victorian Tea Room) but can be easily missed.

Victorian Tea Room would also be great for hosting birthdays, bridal or baby showers!"}
