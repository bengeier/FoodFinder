{"text":"Yum!  What a great choice to visit this little \"hidden gem\" of a restaurant!  The food was fantastic -- spiced just right with lots of layers of subtle flavor... that \"thing\" that separates great food from good food. The owner/chef was a super-nice guy, obviously excited about his food and happy to share his enthusiasm with customers.  The decor is kind of goofy, but gives off a real comfortable vibe.  Very reasonable prices.  The location is close by a lot of the airport hotels, so if you are passing through on business or on your way to the National Parks, do yourself a favor and stop on in.  Do you really want to go to a chain restaurant AGAIN and get the same old food AGAIN?  No!  You want something new and different!  GO HERE!"}
{"text":"I went for the Laksa here and found Tropical Delight was gone. Shock Horror! That was the only Laksa I could find in this hemisphere. Thankfully, and I do mean thankfully there is a new place, new young owner. Reorganised and clean. Much better than before. Laksa is on the menu - and its better. 3 kinds replace the one. You can pick your heat too. Aim low, they will bring you paste if you want to take it up a notch or 10. But you won't need to, its not about the heat its about the taste. Ignore the location - its not fancy, but it is amazing."}
{"text":"Good Malaysian food restaurant in Calgary. Good friendly service. And price are reasonable. I like the laksa here, very tasty. And also like the fact that I can choose the level of spicyness I can handle.  The only dislike I have is the soup provided with the rice dish needs improvement. Other than that the food are great."}
{"text":"My spouse and I stopped for a late lunch on our way through Calgary en route to Edmonton. The waiter was quick to get us seated and attentive through the whole meal (without being obnoxious). He quickly but concisely explained the popular appetizers and main dishes, gave us some time with the menu, and was nearby when we were ready to order. Our food came out quickly and was very tasty. The portions were generous but not excessive, and the prices were very reasonable.  The flavor of the food was definitely there. The only thing stopping me from giving them 5 stars was the quality of the meat - it seemed to be somewhat lacking. However, to be fair, this was my first experience with Malaysian cuisine - it is possible the meat was prepared in a traditional way that doesn't fit my North American palate."}
{"text":"This is a great place for authentic Malaysian food, which is quite rare in calgary. We frequent this restaurant at least once or twice a week. The laksa is so flavourful and makes the laksa at tpot pale in comparison. The beef rendang is very rich in flavour and melts in your mouth. The curry chicken, satay chicken skewers and roti chanai are all very delicious. Great service and friendly staff. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to try malaysian food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The owner always out and chatting with the customer for feed back. Will definitely go back again. Big thumb up to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Waiters are very helpful with the menu, especially for someone who has never had Malaysian food before (like me). I will definitely come back to this place when I come back to Calgary!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  Found this place on yelp when traveling through Calgary.  Food is delicious!  We ordered beef rendang, chicken skewers, roti, fried cheese rangoons, stir-fried noodles, and noodle soup and my family and I enjoyed everything.  Service was also very friendly and even the owner/chef came out to greet us and asked about the food.  Prices are more than reasonable."}
{"text":"Food and flavour was good... but portion size was small compared to other Malaysian places I tried. Did not get full after my laksa and roti."}
{"text":"We were here when it was another Malay restaurant. Decor looks nicer and cleaner now, but mostly same furniture and chairs. We had the Laksa seafood noodle soup and the Roti beef. But were really fast and the Laksa was especially flavourful. We also had the satay chicken skewers, which were excellent. The Chef and owner came out for a chat and gave us some complimentary pickled papaya and talked a lil about the food. Really nice, good service, and most importantly tasty, savoury food at a great price. Will return"}
{"text":"Good food, okay service. I think it's a bit pricey. I had laksa and chicken skewer. Im new to Malaysian food so maybe i don't know what I'm talking about, but it felt like i was having fast food, and for that i mean it's expensive. But i guess i could be wrong. Portion is good. Will return to try few more, but not too soon."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic flavours. Dropped in for lunch and the staff was very friendly. Was not very spicy but was offered some hot sauce on the side that was excellent. The Beef Rendang was tender and and the saffron rice was a nice addition."}
{"text":"I felt like today's food was not up to par. The Laksa was good. You can pass on the popcorn chicken and deep fried wontons. I was hoping for chicken similar to the Taiwanese popcorn chicken... but it ended up tasting like KFC popcorn chicken. The wonton filling was minimal... again nothing special. Service was good."}
{"text":"Found the food to be so so more quality of food court than restaurant. Had Seafood Laska was cheap on the seafood one shrimp only. Also had satay which was pre cooked and dry as rock. I would expect this to be made fresh per order. For the price its not that good."}
{"text":"Finally I find a wonderful place with traditional Laksa.  Since I left Singapore, I have been sadly missing my favorite dish - especially on a cold day like today.  The server made certain to explain the spiciness.  We decided I have lost my Asian spice factor, so I went with a 3. It was amazing! I am going back - next time - Ice Kacang to cool my mouth down. I will be back, with friends to try this delightful dish."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. Again it paid to use Yelp as a guide to great food. We would have never found this jewel of a place right next to an auto shop. My wife thought it looked a little sketchy on the exterior. Once we opened the door, we were greeted by the owner who thoroughly explained his cuisine with enthusiasm. We ordered the curried beef and the signature soup, with chicken satay as an appetizer. All was good, but the soup broth was out of this world! Next time we will pass on the appetizer, and order the fried banana ice cream desert."}
{"text":"Order from skip the dishes, I was asking for 5times spicy for Chicken laksa but it wasn't spicy at all. Also order Nasi Lemak Chicken (5 pieces small piece) and Beef Rendang (5 pieces small cubes). The Rendang too sweet !!! Not worth for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Our flight was delayed so when we landed at the airport, we hadn't eaten in 7 hours and were starving. Immediately drove to this place based on distance and Yelp reviews.  Because we arrived at an odd time (2:30pm on a Saturday), there wasn't anyone else there so the service was super fast. That was perfect since we were hungry AF.  We started off with the roti with curry. The curry tasted like Japanese curry, and the bread was less fried and more phyllo-like than what I'm use to. But given the calories, this version is probably better for you.  The laksa was pretty good. Not the best as some of the ingredients were off (perhaps that's because of what's available in the area?) but my husband loved the broth. The beef rendang wasn't great, but wasn't terrible either. It actually tasted a lot like an Austrian goulash, but without paprika.  Bonus points for having free wifi!"}
{"text":"Amazing Malaysian food. The beef rendang was flavorful and filling. They also carry chicken skewers and coconut shrimp that you can't get enough of, but don't go too late in the day or everything good might be sold out. Also try the drinks, they're not as sweet as they sound and perfect finish to your meal."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! Service was friendly. There weren't many people in there when I went, which was surprising considering the reasonable prices. The menu had variety but wasn't overwhelmingly big. I had the curry chicken and it was a nice sized portion for the price."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. But l had eaten at this place ages ago when the current owners took over and had not been impressed with it. Then, their curry laksa was imbalanced and had too much turmeric and the sambal for the nasi lemak was so hot, it almost burnt a hole in my stomach lining.   Today, l tried their kolo mee and took home thier nasi lemak.  The kolo mee was decent. Lots of fried wontons to lend a crispy element to the dish and it wasn't very greasy. The nasi lemak sambal was off again. It had lots of onions, which l liked but the sambal proportions were all wrong. The sambal had too much vinegar, which leads me to think they used a prepared chilli mix and l had an underlying taste of mustard seed or turmeric,which does not belong in a sambal. Kitchen staff, l hope you are reading this- sambal should consist of ground chillies, belacan and lots of oil to cook out the rawness of the chillies and salt. If you want to add a souring agent, Use tamarind and not vinegar. Also it's called nasi lemak for a reason. There was not enough coconut milk in the rice to qualify as nasi lemak.This is an iconic dish and you really should get it right or else call it something else.    I am glad to see that they are opening another location downtown. It please improve your sambal if you want Malaysians to come to your restaurant."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick spot to grab some food and found this via Yelp! Other reviewers are spot on. The food came quickly and was served piping hot. We had the dry noodle with pork, the curry chicken soup and the roti with curry chicken. All the dishes were delicious, but my favorite was the soup! Spicy with a great curry flavor, the chicken was super tender and the bean sprouts, tofu, egg and lettuce all added to make the soup filling! Great broth. Roti was also really great. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I kinda like this little hole in the wall restaurant, I rated this place in 2015. The food is still the same, its tasty and they have a cheap lunch menu which include a soda. The food is enjoyable and not spicy. Worth checking out I would give this a 3.5."}
{"text":"Love checking out unique and oddly placed restaurants and this is one of them. Small but very well cared for setting, I unfortunately went with a guy whom I shall refer to as Joey \"must complain about everything and love making a scene cause I didn't get enough hugs as a child\" Smith, which certain affected the experience. Super top marks for their soup!! I so wanted to ask if I could have a 20 litre jug of their coconut broth, cause that soup could cure colds and tastebuds. Wanted to try some other items, when the drama prince I was with, stepped on up and started a complaintarama, saying his soup was gross and not edible...nothing like watching a 36 yr old man act like a 6 yr old.  Do give this place a try, if you like to try something different...and take a friend who's adventurous :)"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times that the owner recognizes me at this point, and we chat every time I come in. I've brought so many people here and would continue to bring more. The food I've had on the menu so far is great, but I always get the laksa, which is amazing. I come back here every time and get the same beef rendang laksa. I started coming here when it opened and would continue going back.  The only thing awful about this place is that it's so far away from me, but is a great last meal if you're on the way to the airport and out of the city."}
{"text":"Their nasi lemak with beef rendang is delicious. Their service is super friendly. The place is small and cozy which gives you a very welcoming vibe. I've been here a few times and I'd say I have nothing but good thing to say. Their's laksa is flavorful. Kon lou mee (their dry noodle) reminded me a lot of where I was from which I like. Most of all, their prices are so reasonable. Food is good, service is good, price is good. They are definitely one of Calgary's gems."}
{"text":"impressed to come to this Malaysian gem from New York. excellent food. cute little joint. wall charger by table 2."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and heartwarming on a cold winters day! The laksa is authentic with great spice level selections. The roti canai with beef rendang is marinated to perfection! The deep fried ice cream was a cherry on top to an awesome meal!"}
{"text":"Beautiful little cozy place. We were pleasantly surprised but how well it was done by up lightings and portraits. The service is very warm and the foods are absolutely delicious. The menu is very reasonably priced and the portion sizes are pretty good too. Definitely recommended for friends and family dinners."}
{"text":"The food here is great, it is traditional Malaysian cuisine. We ordered the laksa, satay, and several other dishes. The end result was a happy full stomach. The only downside is that no one knows about this place! The staff was friendly and the chef came out during our meal to chat with us and to see how our meal was."}
{"text":"I've eaten Malaysian food in 2 other countries, this place is hands down the BEST!! And the chef is really cool as well. We had the special laksa and roti curry chicken, all Great!!!"}
{"text":"Best Malaysian food this side of Penang. And best roti and curry sauce since I started my trip through Malaysia at the Tanjong Pagar railway station in Singapore. Fantastic! The young proprietor and cook has created an authentic Malay dining experience in a modest, out of the way strip mall just south of the Calgary airport. I had the roti and chicken wings in curry sauce and Nasi Lemak. Both were delicious and transported me back to fond memories of  Malaysia trekking. The menu is short but well chosen. I highly recommend Mamak Dang. The dining room is simply decorated but quite pleasant given the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch and dinner. We have been there for lunch and their menu looks amazing. This is a Malaysian cuisine who offers malaysian favorite dish: Laksa soup , Rangdang beef, Curry chicken  etc. I tried their rangdang beef which they cook with coconut milk so it is a bit sweet but so much flavor unbelievable! My husband tried their Seafood Laksa which has nice flavor it has little bit of fishy smell so if you dont like fish, then get something else. Owner is really nice came to our table and spoke to us about his experience and cooking. Good food."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Malaysian food. I enjoyed everything I tried, seafood laska, beef noodle soup and roti with condensed milk. The service was professional, and helpful, and our food came out quickly.  Some feedback I would give to the restaurant is to spruce up their look a bit more and menu items to reflect more creative dishes. My rating is more of a 3.5, the food is good, but didn't blow me away."}
{"text":"Great experience here.  The owner was helpful in explaining the menu items and pictures on the menu gave a good idea of how the dish would look.  Reasonable prices and friendly service were welcoming.  It was fun to see the maps of Malaysia on the wall and take a little side trip while in Calgary.  Doors was tasty, with good variety and interesting combinations."}
{"text":"Thought we'd try a new malaysian place. With such a local name like mamak dang, I was too excited to find my never ending search for authentic malaysian flavor.   I was craving a noodle dish and saw they had a kon Lou mee dish. Yes please!!! I asked if it was local malaysian kolomee and the guy said yes. I should have known he wasn't actually a local when he mispronounced \"canai\". A little lesson in Malay, the c is always pronounced \"ch\".   The roti canai is light, fluffy and not too oily. It was quite delicious.  The kolomee was not at all what I was expecting. It's delicious for a dry noodle dish, but not the traditional kolomee with the sauce and char siu.  The reason I gave 3 generous stars is the service. The waiter was exceptionally nice and very helpful. I'd hire him in a minute.  I'd come back to try the laksa for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent malay cuisine.   The randang is just as it should be.  Recommend lunch specials"}
{"text":"I'm currently slurping down the rest of the laksa I ordered from Mamak. It's full of flavor and delicious broth wise. The noodles aren't exactly authentic but it's definitely good for Canada. So bravo! It's spicy, has that seafoody umami depth! Worth a try! I'm from Toronto and haven't had this decent of a laksa."}
{"text":"Located in a very inconspicuous location right off the highway, you are met with a warm, friendly and almost childlike atmosphere.   The set up is warm and simple and the food is authentic as you can get. The owners are actually Malaysian! The food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable. You're paying food court prices for restaurant grade food.  Need I say more?   I felt like I was in Bali again. The rendang and laksa were spot on!"}
{"text":"Since the departure of \"Tropical Delight\" I was worried I wouldn't be able to get my Laksa fix. Since the new owner took over he's spent time perfecting this dish and within a few months everything was back on track.  Ask for your Laksa spicy and you'll be happy, just make sure you don't get Extra or Super spicy, you may regret it. (Unless that's your thing.) The beef Laksa is my Favorite!"}
{"text":"Mamak Dang had big shoes to fill after Tropical Delight vacated this original spot years ago.   I finally got to try their laksa on a spontaneous lunch date. I thought it would be packed at noon on a Friday but there was plenty of room. The ambience reminded me of a 90s style living room - the carpet is worn, the paint isn't new and neither are the tables and chairs.   I ordered the assorted laksa ($12) and it came out quick. I like that I can request the hotness level of my broth on a scale of 0 to 5; other places don't do this! I devoured the entire bowl however I couldn't help but miss Tropical Delight at the end of my meal. The broth, while good, didn't ring bells for me and the chopped lemon grass was annoying to eat.   The service was good. Our drinks were frequently refilled and our dishes were taken away quickly. I'd come back here again because it's close to my work but I left my heart with Tropical Delight."}
{"text":"The location may seem a bit strange, but the food is incredible. We were only in Calgary one night, but I would have gone back over and over again if I could. Great service, friendly staff, all around a perfect meal."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! I was directed here because I did a Google search for Tropical Delight and it gave me Mamak Dang. Seeing as I had already driven here I went to get takeout anyway. I got 4 dishes: Special Laksa, Beef Rendang Laksa, Naan with Chicken Curry and Shrimp rolls. First I tried the shrimp rolls and they were not my taste at all!! They tasted like spit up milk vomit. I'm so sorry for being so graphic, but that one bite I took tasted so bad that I had to spit it out.   The rest of the dishes were delish!! I've never tried laksa ever before and their laksa was a pleasant experience for my first time. The stand out dish was the naan with curry chicken. Yum! It's a great dish to eat with some jasmine rice as well.   They have great customer service, as to be expected with first time restaurant owners! I will definitely be frequenting this place in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent food especially the curry sauce for the Roti Canai. Could have been spicier. Very clean place and good service."}
{"text":"Great food and decent price. I ordered from Skipthedishes and they were really careful in packaging the containers!!"}
{"text":"we have ordered roti kanai with chicken curry, chicken satay and nasi lemak with chicken curry( the anchovies and sweet onion one was least favorite). The meal was very tasty.. We loved the food here. Friendly staff and chef was taking inputs from customer which is a good thing :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Alvin (owner/chef) accommodated me 10 mins prior to closing time, which was very nice of him to do. I ordered the \"Seremban\" Laksa with curry chicken (noodle soup) and Roti Canai with curry chicken. Both were very good. Alvin was out of the beef rendang, but he brought me a piece to sample; this spoke well towards his dedication to excellent service. That beef rendang was ....wow. Just wow.  He even sat down with me and we had a good conversation about his cooking styles and his vision for the restaurant.  I will definitely be back with more friends and colleagues.  If you would like to explore a little bit of Malaysia through your taste buds, combined with excellent service and support for a talented and courteous young man, this is the place.  Did I mention I washed down my flavorful meal with a deliciously fresh coconut? :-)"}
{"text":"When it comes to mom and pop shops making great food, I am all in.   We had a sudden craving for laksa last week, so what's the best way to find great laksa in the city?   Yelp to the rescue.  Sadly, there aren't too many Malaysian / Singaporean restaurants here in Calgary. Mamak came up in our searches and figured that we would try it out. So we drove over on an early Saturday evening around 5:30PM.   Mamak was tucked away in a strip mall in some industrial area, we weren't too sure what to expect. We walked in. Only one other patron there. Strange, maybe it's more of a lunch spot?  Who knows, let's talk about the food though.  Laksa? Delicious. The broth was full of flavour. Great portions. A must-try. Beef Rendang? Just as flavourful. The beef was tender and cooked just right.  Would love to come back with a larger group and try out all of their other dishes. UYE / Yelp Social anybody?  Will be back."}
{"text":"If it's lunchtime and you're in the NE, I suggest you make your way to Mamak Dang. That's what I did on a tip from Terry L.   There's nothing overly fancy about the space, it's what you might expect from one of Calgary's many strip-mall gems. But the food, this is where it's at! The best deal for lunch is in the 2 item ($9.75) or 3 ($10.75) item combos. You can choose from beef rendang, sweet & sour pork, curry chicken wings or deep friend wontons. It also comes with a free can of soda and steamed rice.  I didn't go for the combo, but I did get the beef rendang steam rice with cucumber, green onion, dry onion and cilantro. It was far more than I could finish and half of it came home with me for dinner.  It's worth a try! And if you like crayfish, they have those too... but you've got to order them a day in advance.  Happy lunching!"}
{"text":"The family's favorite spot when passing through Calgary coming back from Banff. The food is very flavorful. Mamakdang has a variety of rice, soups, and noodles with varying levels of spiciness.  Service is always great. Will swing by again when in Calgary."}
{"text":"Super conveniently located as it's really close to the airport! I got takeout from here, a seafood laksa and a garlic pork noodle for my friend. They packaged everything really well and there was no spilling which I really appreciated! My laksa was very flavorful and I loved it! They used the wrong type of noodles though; they used thin rice noodles but laksa noodles are supposed to be thick round ones. There was a good amount of seafood in it and the portions were pretty good. I had a bit of my friend's leftover garlic pork noodle, and the flavor there was really good too! A bit plain next to the laksa, but still good nonetheless."}
{"text":"This place needs to add more items to its menu, it's so limited. Their laksa weren't even a WOW factor but it looks delicious. If I didn't live nearby this area I wouldn't waste my gas to drive there. However if your working nearby this area its a okay spot to go have a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I had the beef rendang which was really tasty! I'm told the Laksa is even better :) the laksa is made with candlenut which fellow nut-allergy sufferers need to be aware of, but this also means that the laksa is more traditionally made. The chef and staff are very eager. The chef is passionate about the food and his creations. His passion and care for the food is quite lovely to see and is apparent in the taste and presentation of his food.  Service was fast at dinner time, but we were there late.   So why only 4 stars? I like my beef rendang spicy, and it wasn't really spicy, but then the chef came out and asked me if I like it spicy. After agreeing, he quickly came out with his homemade chili sauce that he usually adds to spicy dishes. He said to mix it in to see how I like it, and it added the kick I was missing.  I think it would be great to ask customers if they want it spicy when ordering :)) overall, a great first experience though!"}
{"text":"Mamak Dang Fusion Malaysian Cuisine is the second branding of the ones who took over Tropical Delight.  With big shoes to fill I felt they started out rocky.  They re branded and now are Mamak Dang.  I decided to give them another chance for lunch and I sure am glad I did!  Working near the area I missed being able to have quick bowl of spicy and flavourful Malaysian laksa soup.  The quick ethnic lunch options in the area were lacking.  Upon entering I noticed the same familiar furniture but with a few decor additions and touches.  Parts of the table layouts were changed which makes sense.  I was greeted with a friendly hello and was asked to choose a table.  The menu had changed and more options were available.  I opted for my staple, the laksa with thin rice noodles.  I liked the fact I could select between seafood and beef.  I chose the beef as I was told it was the same type of brisket beef used in the rendang.  I was able to choose the spice level as well, I chose medium.  The food came out quick and piping hot.  The flavour was great with just the amount of spice for me.  I could taste the curry but it wasn't overpowering which was good.  I'll definitely come back.  Once word gets out the food has improved I'm sure this place will be just as packed for lunches."}
{"text":"When I walked in here, 10 min before the lunch rush, I wondered, \"Will I give it four or five stars?\" I want to like a little restaurant in Calgary that serves quality food owned by young chefs or entrepreneurs.   I ordered the lunch special. The chalkboard looked great. I was happy to see beef rendang on the menu. I love Malaysian food and have been eating it for years.  And I was so hungry! Thank goodness the lunch special came with a cold can of Coke. Because honestly the can of Coke is what filled me up here. Oh, and it's not cheap here anymore either - like it says on the yelp info.   The taste, flavour, was good. Customer service was questionable at best. The restaurant was so cute I wish I could come back. But I don't think I will. I wasn't treated very well. I told the waiter that most of the beef served was pure jelly heaps of fat. I'm used to some fat on the meat, that's normal! But this was too much. I was only given a few pieces of meat, one piece that was all fat.  The waiters response? He said come back next time and order the chicken. Lots of excuses about why the beef was that way. Nothing offered as an alternative. I showed him him the heap of pure beef fat on the side of my plate. He began told me why they need to cook the beef that way. When they used less fat customers complained...  As I paid he said the beef wasn't for a person who wanted healthy choices. I said I didn't want healthy choices I just didn't want half of what I was served to be fat LOL!?! Sigh. I tried to love the food here.   I'm giving it two stars instead of one because I only had one experience here (a few when it was another Malay restaurant four years ago) so I'm going to say that's not fair. And I will return again perhaps one day to try something else."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a nice change of pace if you are looking for something different.  Friendly wait staff"}
