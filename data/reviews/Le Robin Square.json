{"text":"Got the Mac and cheese (~25$) and the pork belly (~35$ -- definitely on the pricey side), to split between two people. Both were very tasty, but are also both very rich dishes. At some point while eating, they became a bit much to stomach. I'd recommend pairing a lighter dish with either of these (a salad or the soup) to offset the heaviness. Very good food, though!"}
{"text":"We had the onion soup, mac&cheese and for dessert the cheesecake - all courses were very delicious and tasty. Portions are very big. Staff was very friendly. Everything was perfect - we enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"The mac and cheese is amazing. Didn't have to wait in line because I went around 6pm on a Tuesday. I would go back in a heartbeat. Soooo good."}
{"text":"We were lucky and didn't have to wait long for a table. Now knowing how good it was, I'd definitely wait for their incredible mac and cheese. Words can't describe other than you must try it for yourself. The atmosphere was vibrant and the staff was very attentive. Definitely not a quiet place for a romantic dinner. I'm hoping to go back again before I leave Montreal!"}
{"text":"Amazing. I'm in town for a conference and stumbled across this place on Yelp. It has a charming, modern yet homey vibe with wonderfully indulgent food. Everything (really, everything, including the bread) is made by Mama Robin and served by her brood. The quiche was the richest I've ever had. I only wish they had longer hours!"}
{"text":"By far the best meal for this price point I have had in Montreal so far.  The restaurant isn't obvious from the street, and we found ourselves here completely by chance.  This is a small, family-run business, and they are all incredibly kind and welcoming.  The space is mostly contemporary but still warm and inviting, especially the cool light fixtures.  The family buys and cooks local food.  The menu is small, and it doesn't really look like much.  It's a printed sheet in a plastic page protector.  But wow, everything sounds amazing.  Our waitress, one of the family's daughters, walked us through the daily specials, and I had a really difficult time deciding.  She steered me toward the macaroni and cheese, and it was absolutely stunning.  (In my experience, restaurants think mixing more cheeses and adding creme, etc. to mac and cheese makes it better.  To me, it just tastes like heavy, semi-flavorless sludge.)  This is the best macaroni I have ever had.  Aside from the mixture of cheeses, roasted garlic, and truffle oil, it was topped with maple-cured ham.  As if that wasn't enough, she then brought me three different jars of homemade pepper oil, each with slightly different flavor characteristics.  This on the macaroni was delicious.  I would season small sections of the macaroni with the different oils because they were so good, and I kept finding myself audibly making yummy noises because it was so delicious.  My partner had the quiche, and it was cooked to perfection: light, fluffy, and topped with mozzarella cheese.  I have no idea how the combination of cream and these other ingredients didn't make this dish too heavy, but it was brilliant.  This will be at the top of our list for a return visit if we come back to Montreal.  Kudos to the Robin family, and thank you for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Do Not go to this restaurant! It is soooooo expensive and the food is Not good! All the soups, pasta anD pork is awkward! Oh my gosh the taste is just so cremy. No vegetables No fruits only the meat and souce. I can Not understand why People will go to there.Really a terrible dinner."}
{"text":"Tl;dr : Amazing food. Amazing service. Come here.  Confused weather we were at a cafe, restaurant or furniture store we sit opt for a high table no the second floor. The bubbly waitress explains the concept of the restaurant ( family run, local ingredients)  and explains on the menu.  For starters, the burrata cheese pizza sent us to directly to Italy to bask under the Tuscan sun . It was delicious. Excellent to share between two people.  For mains we order their famous Mc and Cheese and a sous-vide brisket. The Mac and cheese is topped with a generous portion of christmas ham. The complex flavours and richness of the ham makes you want to keep eating even if you are full. The beef brisket is beautifully executed with the most amazing mash potatoes I've had. they had the consistency of a mousse and were not too rich.  The only little thing that can be improved are the chairs, they squeak like crazy and kind of awkward.   We end up paying about $80 dollars, definitely not a first date place, more like a \"I introduce her to my friends and parents as my girfriend\" level. They will accommodate any restrictions you have, but if you are vegetarian, just like in life,  you are going to miss the whole point."}
{"text":"This amazing little family run farm to table was the perfect dinner and date night. My gf and I actually went two nights in a row. The ultimate was an amazing dish, as well as the fresh cheese pizza and super yummy desserts. The entire staff is family and close friends of the owner so the food was made with love and the service was personal. Can't recommend enough!!!"}
{"text":"As a traveller looking for dinner one night, I naturally turned to yelp for recommendations. Robin Sq popped up as one of the best restaurants in MTL, and again, I echo the many yelpers before me in saying that this restaurant did not disappoint. I took the advice of others on here and arrived at 830pm to no lines. As I was travelling by myself, I was initially disheartened to hear that there were 2 signature dishes, and that I was going to have to make a tough decision of which main to order. This was until the lovely waitress said to me that they do half and half! The mac n cheese was served first, which was the standout. It was incredibly flavourful without being too salty. The truffle fragrance just fills your entire mouth and olfactories. The texture of the pasta was a tiny bit mushy on the outside and hard on the inside, but I was okay with that. The pork belly was also great, but I'm an incessant fat trimmer so my review won't do the dish justice. The service was fantastic as well, although I was a little bit disappointed to hear that the table across from me got a small dessert on the house and this was not offered to me."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and actually went to restaurant to stand in line for an hour, my family and I were truly disappointment. We ordered the Mac n Cheese, extremely salty; not only could you taste the salt but we also bit into the salt...very disappointing. I would not recommend this restaurant ."}
{"text":"Overrated restaurant.....not sure how the ratings work. No reservation taken, have to wait for over 45 mins at 9.30pm. Although the staff was nice but the quantity of food and also quality in our case was not upto the mark. Not a repeat for me."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Mac and cheese. It was like Christmas ham and all its goodness soaked into the macaroni. The pizza and the specialty Cheese was enjoyed by my son. The wife loved the rigatoni with truffle. Portions were generous, We ordered too much but enjoyed again the next day as leftovers. Staff was very accommodating and explains what each dish is like. Recommended experience if ever you are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellent! Comfort food at a reasonable price and with very attentional service. Everything is homemade even the bread!"}
{"text":"We are here with four of us, two adults and two kids, for a frigid pre-new year's dinner. The smell was amazing on the way in the door. My daughter loved the guinea fowl with Death Valley sauce and Parisian gnocchi. Both were perfect and awesome together. I had the ultimate experience, an wonderfully smoky pork belly that loved up to its name. A gem of a find."}
{"text":"Tout était parfait, la nourriture était succulente, le service était impeccable... Mieux qu'à la maison !  Je recommande fortement ce restaurant familial.  Nous reviendrons !"}
{"text":"The 1 hour wait was made up by the delicious pork belly and purees. We also ordered the notorious Mac and cheese, which did not disappoint, and the pizza with delicious gooey Italian cheese was super tasty. Overall, if you're in Montreal check this place out!"}
{"text":"My husband & I were visiting Montreal on our way home from a few days at Niagara Falls.  We stopped into Le Robin Square based upon Yelp reviews!  It was a Saturday night and we weren't dressed for anything other than casual, so in Montreal I was a little concerned.  We were fine at Le Robin Square.  We ate downstairs, which is very small but there is an upstairs which perhaps is a larger space.  The food was amazing!  I had the macaroni and cheese which is heaven, shear comfort food!  My husband had gnocchi, equally as wonderful.  We shared a bowl of the smoked jalapeno soup, which was excellent too.  We shared because I'm not a fan of spicy foods.  Next time we're each getting our own bowl of soup! We plan to go back to Le Robin Square.  Montreal is a beautiful city and within driving distance for us, so many return visits are completely do-able."}
{"text":"This was my family's favorite restaurant in Montreal!  Although the space is small, the staff are friendly and the food is deliciously fresh!  All five of us were extremely pleased.  I could rave about their flavorful food for days!  The prices are good, too.  A big win!"}
{"text":"That was awesome.  Onion soup and Mac & Cheese.  Stuffed.  Supper friendly family restaraunt."}
{"text":"Best food we have had while visiting Montreal.  We got the mac and cheese and grilled cheese sandwich.  The  mac and cheese had truffle oil in it.  It was just the perfect amount, you could taste it but it wasn't overpowering.   The grilled cheese was accompanied by mango jelly which now I will require for all of my future grilled cheeses.  The food was farm to table fresh, but not pretentious at all."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant we went to on our visit to Montreal. The restaurant was quite small but has a cozy, friendly atmosphere. The waitress who seated us was very friendly and didn't mind switching to English for us. I had the gnocchi and my husband had the Mac and cheese. Both were delicious! The onion soup was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Well worth the wait!! The food and service were outstanding!  Decor was fun and loved the music.  When i had heard that the Mac and cheese was so good, I thought, hmm okay, how good can make and cheese be? This answers the question! Out of this world, savory with herb spice and just delicious.  We also had the porkbelly which was cooked perfectly and the yam parsnip purée amazing.  Wish there were a bit more veggies, but does not detract at all with how delicious it all was.  The service is warm and welcoming.   It is a family run business and our server, who I think is part owner ,made us feel like we were a part of the family.  This is a must go spot!"}
{"text":"My children and I were exploring old town when we happened upon this restaurant. The menu and the fact it was family owned drew me in.  The look of the restaurant, the food, and the service were all 5 stars. I had the carrot soup and the grilled cheese, and it was amazing. The dipping sauce for the grilled cheese was a nice addition to the traditional grilled cheese. I felt adventurous and thought I would try the carrot soup. It was creamy, sweet and salty, and just a hint of root flavor. So good. I never thought carrot soup would be good. It probably isn't unless it is done just right. My children had the macaroni and cheese. Noodles are handmade, and it wasn't your ordinary Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I was one of the lucky ones who did not have to wait. Regardless, my dining experience was fantastic. While I can concur with other reviewers that The Ultimate Experience (Pork Belly) was phenomenal, I would suggest saving room for dessert. The homemade touches are definitely noticed! This will be my recommendation for anyone coming to Montreal."}
{"text":"Consider this a 41/2 star review. They only lost half a star due to the limited menu and they ran out of the Redneck Pulled Pork that I had been dreaming about. Our sever was adorable and really cared about the restaurant and its patrons. Not sure if this was an aspect of her personality or because she was a friend of the family but it really adds to your dining experience when the staff cares. We missed this place on our initial visit to Old Montreal but fortunately it's a short walk from the Place d'Armes metro stop."}
{"text":"By far the best place I ate in Montreal and one of my favorite meals, ever. We were in town during the city-wide Mac and cheese festival, and the night we went here they were only serving that - which, believe me, is fine by me. The food alone was absolutely fabulous (homemade down to the three hot sauces served with the dish), but the INCREDIBLE service topped it off. You feel the fact that this restaurant is family-owned, and I'm not sure I've ever gotten such good service anything else. I wish I lived in the city just so I could make this my local. If you go anywhere to eat in Montreal, make it here."}
{"text":"We picked this restaurant based on the reviews and loved it. The Mac and cheese was incredible as was the guinea fowl and pork belly. The waitress/owner was super friendly. This was the best meal of our trip."}
{"text":"Amazing just simply amazing.  Small but everything a restaurant should be. Friendly service, amazingly tasty food that is lovingly prepared with a great local beer menu and well matched wines.   This is a restaurant where the owners love food and are engaged with the customers.  I would love to eat here every time I am in Montreal"}
{"text":"The beef shoulder is their take on the classic tenderloin with mushrooms, peas, rice and a perfected red wine sauce (seen below)  Every component was simply executed with complex flavours.  Delicious.  However the most valuable stars of the evening  were the hardworking waitresses, Tracey? and Christine? who manned two floors of diners yet took care of all our needs with a smile and welcoming attitude.     Great food complemented by great atmosphere encouraged lively conversation and a memorable evening."}
{"text":"Fantastic in every way! Food is amazing and the price is reasonable. Definitely give it a try if you're in neighborhood."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Great service, wonderful food - a true gem (btw the jam was delicious!) we will definitely come back when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"FAMILY. OWNED. AND. OPERATED.  ... is the kind of greatness perhaps Ronald McDonald could have achieved if he had not decided to spawn a billion McShareholders over the years  But rest assured you can expect greatness from this fine establishment without fail. Trust the saying \"Trust the line\". You have no idea how many people would stop and ask us \"Is there good food here, why is the line so long?\" We would say yes and they would still walk away as if they they needed more reassurance than a one-worder. Weird.  The menu is short and sweet. The staples on this menu are the Mac and Cheese and L'Ultimate Experience (which I should have tried in hindsight with a name like that, takes something like 5 days in total to make... and only 5 mins for me to destroy probably, but we'll never know)  Mac n Cheese: Oh so much truffle. Oh so much cheese. It's weird that they refer to their pulled pork as Ham, but I don't have a problem with that. If anything, it caught me by surprise and everything was such a delightful combination  10 out of 10 times I would return, even if the line is all the way to Halifax"}
{"text":"Love this place! My family went here in August and it was great food, the bomb service great can't wait to came back"}
{"text":"Just a great, small, family-run place. I had a superb Lasagna Bolognese with a nice Spanish red. Kid-friendly, and family filled, but still very good food. They have a great name (which I have already forgotten) for their grilled cheese sandwich. To be fair, I was there for a midday lunch, not a more formal dinner. But they take their food seriously, and the staff are lovely too.  Keep in mind that you really have to pay attention to the street address, though, as it is VERY easy to miss this place walking by. It is in the kind of no-man's land between Le Quartier des Spectacles and Vieux Montreal."}
{"text":"All the previous reviews are no exaggeration.  I started thinking \"Ulcch, how long is this line?!\" and ended up in a big hug with the hostess Sylvia because it was such an all-around fantastic experience. The true warmth of the whole family rubs off on everyone so even waiting in line is a party - being able to order a beer in line certainly helped. I'm squeamish about eating fat and fish skin, but I ate the Icelandic cod skin and all parts of the pork belly happily.  Go now!"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is perfect! The food is exceptional and cooked with love and passion and the service is exactly how it should be.   My husband and I visited Le Robin twice while on vacation because we loved the food so much! Our first time the wait was short maybe 5 minutes, we were seated and greeted by the friendliest people. The owner is the sweetest women she hugs you and is just bubbling over with happiness.   We ordered the Mac n cheese of course, mine vegetarian and my husband had ham in his. We were blown away of the amount of flavor packed into that bowl! It was so creamy, and salty (in a good way) and the truffle adds such an earthiness to it it's absolute Mac n cheese perfection.   Our second time I got the same thing (I couldn't help myself) and my husband got the non Mac cheese dish some meat..? Forgive me I don't remember exactly what it was but he was in love with every bite. I wished so badly we could take this restaurant home with us! Please give it a try, you won't be disappointed, it's worth the wait trust me! The service is outstanding and the food even better."}
{"text":"Nice craft beers, friendly wait staff, excellent food. Menu is short, but that's nice for a change and considering how well made everything was, perfectly appreciable. Our group of 6 tried almost everything on the menu and there were thumbs up all around. Would definitely go back. Before I went tonight, Robin square had 79 5 star reviews, now it has 80. I'm sure there are many more to come."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal on business and le robin square was a few blocks away. From the moment I walked in Slyvia and her staff made me and my colleagues like we just came over to a friends house to have dinner. The soup of the day which was Cream of Mushroom was delicious and the ultimate experience lived up to it's name. The bread with each dish was also so fresh and really added to the feeling we we're in someones house. Even though I was in town for a day, my dinner at Le robin square guaranteed a return visit for me."}
{"text":"Amazing local restaurant. Simple menu but complex dishes. We shared to get as much variety as possible. Macaroni and cheese was unique and rich in flavor. So glad we got in early- line was down the street when we were leaving."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with my family.  We were a group of five. When we arrived to the restaurant there was a short line. Since the restaurant is small we waited for about 45 minutes for seating, but those 45 minutes were well worth it! We loved everything about this place: the food, the intimate feel, and the personalized customer service we received. We ordered the Mac and cheese, the Iceland cod fish, and the pork belly. Each of these dishes were succulent and rich in taste. The sauce for the cod fish was light and extremely tasty. The Mac and cheese with the ham on top was absolutely delectable. It wasn't too cheesy and heavy. Now, the pork belly with the sauces that accompanied it (saffron and an apricot sauce I believe) was perhaps the best pork belly, or even the best pork I have ever tasted in my life! As soon as I bit into the pork belly it melted in my mouth. It was well seasoned, extremely tender, juicy, and flavorful. Words do no justice to each of the plates we tried. To top it all off we had an apple (and can't remember the other fruit) tart for dessert, which tasted exquisite. You can definitely taste the freshness of everything made. All dishes are prepared from scratch and are farm fresh. You can tell that this restaurant is a family owned and operated restaurant. As soon as you walk in you are treated like family and are attended to like a relative sitting at the dinner table for the holidays. I highly recommend this place and will come back to eat here when I return to Montreal, and I will also recommend this restaurant to my friends and family that plan on visiting Montreal in the near future as well."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Small space with tremendous hospitality.  Short walk from the convention center."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my older brother and we had such a great night! Sylvia greeted us at the door and told us all about the place. Kaitlin was our server for the night and she was so great!Both my brother and I got the Mac n cheese and it was the best we've ever had. I'm so glad we visited this gem!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! We visited from New York and before arriving I decided I had to have the Mac and cheese. We went around 9ish on a Saturday and there was a line. About fifteen minutes later they asked if there were any parties of two waiting so we got to cut the line of what seemed like larger parties. The staff was beyond nice and I'm still dreaming of the Mac and cheese. We also got the burrata pizza which was DEELISH. Can't say enough about how great this place is and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is PHENOMENAL and pair it with their specially imported Spanish red wine! Amazing! Added bonus: the host is the sweetest and most caring woman!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were very disappointed in our experience. The dishes we ordered (squash soup and pork belly) were overpriced, especially for the amount of food. The restaurant was cold and the music way too loud."}
{"text":"Amazing food worth the wait! The pork belly is the best I have had and we are world eaters. Same with the foie gras truly the best. Mac and cheese with truffle delicious the ham on top is perfect and the hot sauce on the side made me cry it was that good! We waited almost an hour but found out at the end they are closing in Feb and reopening in a new spot down the street where they will take reservation- perfect!!"}
{"text":"This is amazing French cuisine! I went for the first time on a Wednesday night while visiting Montreal on business. Not too crowded and I waited perhaps 10 minutes to be seated. Service was quick though and very friendly. I had the Mac and Cheese with Xmas Ham and it was phenomenal. It is filing though and 3/4's of the way through I knew dessert was out. The Le Troudu Diable McTavish IPA was an excellent IPA. It's apparently from a local micro brewery. Wonderful food, good price, good service, would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had the pork belly, the goat cheese tart, and the bread pudding with maple syrup for dessert. Cool ambiance, excellent food, great date night!"}
{"text":"A true highlight of our visit to Canada, this family-run bistro lived up to the hype. Our hostess and server, Silvia, was the epitome of warmth. The food, cooked by her brother and mother was fabulous. For lunch, our party of four ordered the quiche, the Cesar salad with beef, the mac and cheese (also with beef) and the chili. I have no idea how they get such wonderful flavors into their meats. The quiche is like butter. Ask about the homemade salsas. We eyed other people enjoying grilled cheese sandwiches. They looked great. I hope to return to Canada soon so I can order four different delicious items from the menu. This place was fantastic."}
{"text":"The most amazing dinner to warrant my first Yelp review. The pork belly was like cutting through butter with the a perfectly charred rind. The macaroni and cheese was delicious with an amazing sweet ham on top. The soup special was cream of onion and jalapeño and was smooth but with a little kick. The staff was super friendly and sweet. Can't sing enough of their praises!"}
{"text":"A homey family-owned restaurant, friendly staff and...delicious food! Although we went bit late (15 mins before closing time) they accommodated us and served dinner quite quickly. The sirloin steak and the soup of the day were amazing and served with tasty creams and paté. I'd definitely recommend it for a dinner in town."}
{"text":"Small, family run restaurant. My wife had the mac and cheese and I had the pork belly. Both were absolutely fantastic! This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Out of this world good. A family owned locally sourced restaurant that's like nothing else. I had the quiche--best I've ever put in my mouth.  I felt like I was in a dream and my fairy godmother told me to eat here. Heaven on earth. And the owner gave my a wonderful hug before I left! Who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"Wow!  Worth what ever time you have to wait in line outside - no reservations taken.  The fresh and ample salad complemented possibly one of the best meals that I have anywhere, any place, any time, period.  Yes the Mac and cheese is crazy good.   This is not really Mac and cheese.  It is fresh pasta, in a complex creamy cheese sauce with layers of flavor, and smoked ham that pushes it over the top.  That was not even the best dish, we had tonight.  The pork belly, and accompanying sauces was simply mind blowing.  Not only was this meal an outstanding value, I would challenge you to find something better anywhere in this city.  The atmosphere is very casual, the service was also great, and the food is prepared with passion.  Definitely a must stop!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The Mac and cheese was incredible - great combination of flavors. It has truffle oil, but this was not overpowering. Nice selection of local beers.  Great service. Family-run business."}
{"text":"We were very excited about this place after reading all the great reviews. When we arrived (before opening) a line was forming down the block, and the restaurant opened late. Only four entrees to choose from and one (the calamari) was not available that night. No specials to add to the limited menu. Three of the four cost more than $30, one costs more than $40. I had the macaroni and cheese, which was good--tasty, but not amazing or anything and not worth the $25 it cost. It was pretty heavy, but I didn't mind finishing it. My wife had the \"ultimate experience\", a pork belly that takes 5 days to prepare. It was super fatty. Fatty to the point of being gross. She forced herself to eat 2/3 of it, because it cost so much and she'd been looking forward to the meal, but it left her feeling sick. Not worth the cost or the hype. Go someplace else."}
{"text":"First meal I had in Montreal. The mac and cheese with jambon tasted pretty good. It had a sweetness to it that I liked, but after awhile I found it too sweet if that makes sense. I would recommend getting the Mac and cheese, but only the appetizer size. Friendly service"}
{"text":"Just lots of fun.  Sirloin was perfect.   The bread home made.  Basically i had something i NEVER had.  Relaxed, had a new type of beer, and made friends."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the waitress was really attentive to our needs. Had their daily soup which was carrots and squash cream soup if i remember correctly, mac and cheese, and 'The Ultimate Experience'; all of which were wonderful. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Friendly family owned and operated restaurant.  The co-owner spent time to introduce her family and their restaurant's cuisine to mes amis et moi for a late evening dinner.  The cuisine was simply elegant with a flair for internationally influenced touches:  all freshly made with many locally grown ingredients.  We sampled the gnocchi with chipotle topping and the lentils with local saucisse de poulet (chicken sausage).  Ceux-ci étaient délicieux!"}
{"text":"The waitress was super friendly and considerate. She informed us that the ham on the Mac & Cheese had maple and offered to serve it on the side since I am allergic to it. She soon returned, ran up the stairs to inform us that this batch of ham didn't have maple and asked if we'd like it on top of the Mac & Cheese. Some other people wouldn't have bothered to run up the stairs just to tell us that. They probably would of just kept the ham and the Mac & Cheese separate and call it a day.  Our waitress also recommended the pizza and after eating it, I recommend it too. I would surprisingly filling.  The only downfall of this place is that it is cash only (or at least that was what we were told)."}
{"text":"Fantastic! My hubs and I shared the pork belly and mac and cheese. And both were amazing! Save room for dessert! Crème Brulé and \"unemployment cake\" - every person that we spoke to that works there was gracious and happy. A great dining experience!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had a very delicious dinner here on a Saturday night. The menu was smaller and a little more expensive than I had anticipated ($20 - $35 CAD per dish) however our meal was one one the most unique and  tasty dinners that we have had. We shared the pork belly, which was braised, smoked and brined over 5 days and served with 3 very delicious sauces / purées. These were among the most most delicious sauces I have ever had. The dinner and atmosphere were memorable and we would highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food and service are exceptional at Le Robin Square.  It felt like we were at home in the kitchen of the family that runs the restaurant.  The food was amazing - I had the mac and cheese with the family's Christmas ham on top.  It was delicious and I was so sad that I couldn't finish it, but I had the beet salad as a starter that was also quite large.  The servers were so friendly and warm, it was such a treat to have a meal here!"}
{"text":"Close to the most miserable experience ever at any restaurant anywhere. The experience was ruined by a sound system cranked up to absurd levels leaving me at a loss to explain the positive reviews. Yelp's short description of this place lists the noise level as average. By no stretch is that accurate. Unless you want to be subjected to deafening racket that makes any conversation short of screaming into your companion's face impossible, your visit will be miserable."}
{"text":"Excellent. What a wonderful experience. The Mac and cheese and the fresh cheese pizza was fabulous. The apple cheesecake tart was incredible. A small, intimate place where you feel like a guest in their home."}
{"text":"I loved the vibe of this place - family-owned and proud! Delicious take on Mac and cheese and the Christmas ham definitely got me in the holiday spirit in this cold, cold city! A warm welcome in the tundra."}
{"text":"Our food highlight of our long weekend trip. Small, family-run joint with a focussed menu highlighting local ingredients.   We had the smoked-meat-topped mac and cheese (delicious, with a slight sweet note) and two orders each of the pork belly and the beet salad with homemade cheese and candied nuts. Everything was top notch. Washed down with a light, tasty local brew. Wish my companions had room for dessert -- was sorry to miss it. Next time!  One note: we brought our toddler. They didn't have any highchairs, so she sat on my lap, but the staff were gracious and friendly with us and her.   Get here early (look for the big red R on the window) and even if the gate over the door, just wait! We thought maybe they were closed, but we waited around (got there just before 6pm opening on Saturday). Within a few minutes of us arriving, there were maybe 20 people waiting behind us. The restaurant was completely filled by 6:10 and the queue just grew from there."}
{"text":"Favorite meal in Montreal. Came here on a Thursday night for dinner and sat upstairs. Our waiter (forget his name, was from Belgium and was going home soon) was amazing! Friendly and knowledgeable. We started with two beers and the soup which was a creamy onion which was perfect! So flavorful and delicious. We split the mac and cheese and the pork belly off the waiters recommendations and both were out of this WORLD. Mac and cheese comes with homemade hot sauces. 4 days later and I'm still dreaming of the Mac and cheese. We had to chance to speak with the daughter of the Robin family and she was so kind and sweet and really described how the family is all part in the business. Mother makes the bread, brother makes the hot sauces, recipes are family recipes and everything is made IN HOUSE. Amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. What a gem of a restaurant. We arrived at our hotel later in the evening after a long drive. I looked on YELP to find a cozy restaurant with great food and wine...but close by so we could walk. The reviews looked great and the pictures made the food look tasty. We walked in and were greeted by the most charming, bubbly young woman who turned out to be one of the owners. She spoke with such pride about her family and their involvement in running the restaurant. She described each dish on the simple menu.  We ordered the cream of asparagus soup with a hint of jalapeño. It was absolutely amazing. From there we had the burrata pizza. That was so simple yet full of flavor. It brought us back to a small town in Italy.  We finished with the mac and cheese with ham and truffle oil. The layers of flavors and the balance of sweet, salt, roasted garlic and truffle was amazing. We have two nights in Montreal and will strongly consider making Le Robin Square our choice two nights in a row."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!!  This is a family-owned hole in the wall a couple of blocks away from the Basilica. I went here on a whim with my girlfriend on a freezing cold Saturday night, and probably because of the weather, we got a table no problem.  There are two eating spaces, one down by the kitchen and a second one tucked away upstairs in a loft-like space. We were lucky to get a nice table on the loft overlooking the lower area and the kitchen.  My girlfriend got the pork belly with a celery truffle puree.  I have serious food envy but don't eat pork, so I sampled the celery truffle puree, and it was out of this world.   I ordered the Rigatoni with black truffle oil with a bottle of craft porter.  Both were spot on.  The one downside of the menu was that there wasn't a single main course without pig, and this dish came with bacon.  I just ate around the bacon and enjoyed the meal without reservation, but pig-averse folk beware.  The service was awesome: friendly, down-to-earth and helpful in making beer recommendation, providing information about the ingredients in the food (all the bread is made from scratch in house), and the chef who makes it all go."}
{"text":"This review is really long overdue (went back in October 2015), but the meal and the experience stood out from many of my restaurant experiences that I felt the need to share.  The waitress was extremely friendly and explained the restaurant concept- family-run, locally sourced produce (friends + family), and a simple but creative twist on the food.  I ordered way too much food (mac and cheese + fettuccine? + soup) and can't quite remember everything I had, but just remember the feeling that everything was really, really good and fresh.  The mac + cheese with pork really stood out.  I didn't have any room for dessert so I did a little bit of sightseeing and came back just for dessert (pudding with maple syrup + milk) and was well worth it.  I came during their downtime and had a great conversation on how passionate the family was about the restaurant.  I would highly recommend for a welcoming and delicious meal (and a must go if you are a visiting as I was)."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the 45 minute wait.  Go hungry because the portions are large and the food is rich."}
{"text":"LOVED the experience! We went right around when they open, just to make sure we don't have to wait while drooling. Was a great idea, that paid off!  We got the mac n cheese with the ham add-on and the redneck grilled cheese. I am not a mac n cheese person, but the bf who is, loved his lunch. I was really taken aback by the ham on his plate. It wasn't the over-processed ham (sorry, not a ham person!) that you get stateside. It was like pulled pork, but ham-ified! The flavor of ham, but none of the spongy texture. The bread on my grilled cheese was to die for! I even requested, and received, the recipe! I will have to try it! The pulled bbq pork in the grilled cheese is a bit on the sweet side on its own, but it's perfect with the saltiness of the cheese, against the backdrop of the bread. The portions are huge as well. We both had leftovers, that we happily devoured for dinner.  Even though we were stuffed, just could not turn down the mango cheesecake. It was light cheesecake in a small mason jar, with mango coulis on top. Everything was topped with shortbread cookies and a stick of rich and intense chocolate. Totally worth the feeling of being overstuffed!"}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Old Montreal. Le robin square is a family owned restaurant. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The restaurant has limited seating and is usually very busy and has lines out the door. I tried to go Thursday evening, but the line was too long. So I went back on Friday at opening . All the food was on point and very tasty, but the pork belly, mac and cheese and pizza stood out. The owners Mom makes all the bread and deserts daily. The brother makes all the food and a homemade hot sauce that goes well with the mac and cheese. mac and cheese was creme based instead of cheese and was delicious. The pork belly was so tender and melts in your mouth. The pizza which has arugula, tomatoes, and burata cheese was delicious as well. The burata which the  owner said was imported from Italy weekly was very fresh and tasty. Definitely worth the stop if your in Montreal."}
{"text":"Being alone and far from home, a good dose of comfort food (signature mac and cheese with a good dollup of hot sauce and maple glazed ham) was the perfect cure."}
{"text":"Very delicious food.. Clean, fresh and super tasty. I truly Highly recommend this place for anyone wanting to have a great experience.   The staff are sooooooo nice and friendly, they are super excited to help you find the perfect order to enjoy the most."}
{"text":"I absolutely cannot fault this place. The menu is small but seasonal (always a great sign) with locally sourced ingredients. Friendly staff who clearly know and love the food.    The Mac and cheese has to be tried, it's unreal. They even did me a \"baby\" portion as an appetiser as I had to try it after reading the reviews!  I had pork belly for my main which was utterly delicious.   Sublime food, friendly staff. I just wish I lived in Montreal so I could come back here again!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Service was top-notch. Went there twice during my stay at Montreal. I'll be visiting again when I'm back there!"}
{"text":"Food was great, and the service was fun. The mac and cheese is different but the best I've had. Dessert was also quite amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, and deserves its sterling reputation. We had their specialty pork and the specialty mac n cheese. Both dishes were amazing and I would have expected to find them only at more expensive restaurants. The pork is prepared over a period of 5 days! The restaurant is family owned and operated, giving it a dynamic and irreproducible charm. Come hear tales of French Canada in the hearth of this lovely family!"}
{"text":"Totally lost in the city...we were somehow following our phone's directions to Rue Robin.  I was thinking, kind of a sketchy place for a restaurant with 5 stars....must really be worth it. Check the phone again and we are 2 Metro lines each with 2 stops PLUS a 9 minute walk. What the??? We finally find it after 2 hours. ....silly tourists! Oh my gosh the Cream of Onion with Jalapeño soup was amazing and the piece of homemade bread along side was delicious! I had the Gnocchi Poutine. .. ....amazing! And my husband had the Ultimate Experience.....the angels were singing, it was like we were in heaven. The waitress, part of the Robin family was so friendly and personable, she added to the experience too. Robin Square's atmosphere and amazing food made getting lost so worth it once we found it! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We went here for our first dinner in Montreal. The waitress was so friendly! We had the Incredible Mac&Cheese as well as the Ultimate Experience. Both are wonderful! For dessert we had the Pudding Chomeur to get our first taste of maple syrup. Delicious! If we were staying longer than 4 days we would go again!"}
{"text":"Best maple Christmas ham I've ever had. It was amazing. My husband and I shared it and he's vegetarian so we got it on the side. It was close-your-eyes so you can enjoy the amazing flavour kind of good.  The mac and cheese was also amazing. It had so many layers of flavours that just kept coming. Definitely a must-order and if we had more time to visit Montreal we'd be back there to eat again.  The restaurant opens at 6pm and we were there and starving at 5:50. There was already a bit of a line waiting for the doors to open, but we were seated right away.   Service was awesome. Super awesome. Family owned and run place, and if you're server isn't family their a friend of the family and consider themselves family, so it's all around awesome. We ate so fast, we felt like we were in and out, but the food was THAT good."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, une petite touche gastronomique au confort food. Personnellement, les prix sont légèrement trop élevés. Un restaurant a essayé, pudding chômeur incroyable!"}
{"text":"Wow!  The mac n cheese was uniquely great, but the calamari was even better.  Our best meal in Montreal."}
{"text":"This place is great. We had the Mac and Cheese and Caesar Salad and shared family style. Both dishes were excellent with the Mac and Cheese being some of the best I have ever had. Great service and atmosphere. Deserves the 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a weeknight. We only waited about 10 minutes cause it was only the 2 of us. A party of four behind us were told their wait would be about 40 minutes, so I guess you should take into account the wait time when going to this restaurant. So... onto the food. We shared the beet salad, which was average. We ordered the mac and cheese and the pizza. Both were really good. The portion size for the mac and cheese was huge. We could not finish it so we took the rest home. The service was really good. They were prompt and always ready with the water. It had a lively atmosphere. The only weird thing was a large tv screen that was showing a sunset and then a campfire throughout the evening. It was such a random decor."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and amazing food, in Montreal for just the weekend and I'm tempted to come back and try the dishes I didn't the first time. Must do."}
{"text":"Simple menu, delicious food, great service, and club like music. This place is great. Kids enjoyed it as well. Would be even better if they had better lighting so we could have seen the food in all its glory. Thx for a good evening."}
{"text":"This will be the first place I eat when I return to Montreal. Family owned. Chill vibe, exceptional home style food, personal and lovely service. One of the top places to eat in Montreal for sure."}
{"text":"Im sure this review will be met with negativity, but the intent is to promote improvement. While we admittedly could have done a better job of reviewing the menu before we arrived; the staff could have done a better job of being gracious. From the time we arrived it was clear that not everyone was happy to see us. While we were appreciative that our hostess spent the time to setup a table in their cozy establishment, we decided that the menu was not to our liking for this particular night. Instead of rudely and abruptly leaving I took a moment to politely alert the hostess. Her response was less than gracious, and while I understand the effort to prepare a table I don't agree with this response. If you are in the hospitality industry then hospitality may be an important aspect of the profession. Unfortunate as we intended to try them another night, but now we wont bother. 2 stars because I prefer to be gracious in my use of stars; despite their ingratitude. I'm willing to concede that this may be irregular for an otherwise good establishment. I wish them well with their establishment."}
{"text":"If your going to Montreal and love food, you must come here... not a big menu selection but high quality with their small menu selection with all farm fresh local ingredients.. my girlfriend had the pork belly which was so tender and juicy and full of flavor which was amazing by itself and the sauces only expanded the flavor and I had the mac n cheese with pulled pork and was creamy and cheesy with some sort of flavored sea salt for texture with a sweet pulled pork a great combo.. the waitress was very friendly and we talked about local things to do for about 10 minutes and then one of the owners came over to chat and even hand wrote us a list of about all the great things to do in Montreal.. my only 5 star review on Yelp.. well deserved"}
{"text":"This adorable restaurant is worth the stop. My friends and I visited le robin square all the way from New Jersey and were beyond impressed! The food did not disappoint.  Each of us got something different and we all would recommend the Mac and cheese with Ham!! I'm still craving it!   This family owned business puts pride in their food and service!!! We will definitely be going back next year."}
{"text":"Home restaurant. A little bit crowded. Mac&Cheese is great. Other foods are also very tasty."}
{"text":"You only need one reason to visit Montrèal ... this is it! It's a family run business and they're really nice. The food is just unbelievable! They only have about 35 seats so it can happen that you have to wait. But believe me, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Je note sur la nourriture, et non le service. Oui les filles sont gentilles et font un bon service, oui c'est familial, mais le macaroni au fromage était franchement mauvais. J'avais l'impression que ma bouche se faisait violer par 5 saveurs agressantes, beaucoup trop prononcées. Noyer ses pâtes dans l'huile de truffe et le gros sel n'en fait pas un grand plat. Le bonbon mauve à la fin de mon repas était vraiment la meilleure partie et m'a aidé à lutter contre les rots au macaroni qui me torturaient.   Certains \"foodies\" parlent d'un goût acquis pour leur macaroni au fromage, c'est du mac n' cheese man, pas du scotch. C'est mauvais, et ça surfe sur une petite réputation de quelques foodies qui ont crié au génie, et tous les wannabe critiques suivent le pas. Un acquired taste, calvasse!"}
{"text":"The whole dining experience is distracted by the disorganization at waiting in the queue to get a table (they don't take reservations which is fine). They should know who is in the queue first.  For waiting diners, it seems whoever stands closest to the door will get the table first.  This kind of disorganization takes away any pleasure that the food might provide, and really does a disservice to the kitchen. Is it so hard to have a simple system to track the queues??  The food is mostly good, but couldn't compensate for the chaos in getting a table. The wait staff is busy so let's get them some help - please incorporate some sort of system to help manage the queue."}
{"text":"The people who run this restaurant are clearly nice, so I take no pleasure in writing this review.  I'm cool with the no-frills setting and the line to get in.  That said, I'm shocked that this place is rated so highly and that people still line up to eat here.  Pork belly is sort of a slamdunk ingredient and hard to screw up, but in this case it was far too sweet. The Mac and cheese is somewhat interesting with the truffle oil, but distractingly oversalted, and covered with maple glazed pork which was again so heavily sweetened it ruined the dish.  The Buratta and fresh tomato sauce on the pizza was great, but the crust was so lifeless, I wonder if it was premade and frozen. I walked out after the meal feeling confused, and a bit sorry for the long line of people waiting to get in."}
{"text":"\"There aren't enough stars.\" -my boyfriend. Just, go here. It is absolutely worth every minute of the wait and every dollar of the food. The Robin family is amazing, we had Sylvia as our server and she is bubbly, makes you feel like you're home, and is constantly on point with food recommendations. They won't Nickel and dime you, she specifically said everything was about the food and it is obvious. Both her and her brother went to culinary school and she went to bakery school.   We got the Mac and cheese and pork belly. We also got the onion and jalapeño soup to start. It was easily the best meal we had in Montreal. Cleaned our plates and had an amazing time doing so. Everything is rich and filling, so come with an empty belly!!"}
{"text":"I searched for \"poutine\" and this place came up with high ratings and an option to take out. When I walked through the door the hostess confirmed that they take carry-out orders, but consulting the menu I realized that poutine is not on it.   Not to despair, I decided to go with something they call \"the ultimate experience\" which is a pork flank cooked to perfection, bathed in some delectable sauce and with a purée to drizzle over the top. I imagine if you order and eat at the restaurant the presentation will be a little different. The mind-blowing flavor and texture will be the same, however. Seriously, this was incredible."}
{"text":"For us, Le Robin Square is about comfort food, large portions, and family pride (Mom, Son, Daughter).    The evening started out with the daughter (hostess and waitress) sharing with us that the restaurant is a family affair,  and they use local products.  We sat upstairs and the decor is simple and nice.  The menu selection is small, and we had their Caesar salad, mac and cheese, and steak.  All were tasty, and we were too full to have dessert.     Le Robin Square is a gem if you are into good comfort food and genuine service."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant to go without kids, I say that because we had 3 kids (age 6 to 9) and the items on the menu was not their taste. Good thing that we fed them a burger somewhere else before lining up for about 1 hour to get our table.  The service is excellent, the food was good, but it's quite pricy.  However, I do appreciate that they only have a few things on the menu and they do it well.  Our favourite was the brined smoked pork belly called the \"The Ultimate Experience\" for $34. The Incredible Mac & Cheese $23 has truffle oil, so it's more of an grown up gourmet taste, which the kids didn't appreciate, but I thought it was ok. I don't think I will return, but enjoyed the first time experience."}
{"text":"I honestly do not understand all the positive reviews.  We came here expecting the wonderful service and food everyone thrives about and received an inadequate- and expensive experience.  Let's start from our arrival at this restaurant. We tried to open the door to draw the attention of the hostess on the fact that outside there was a line that had been waiting for several minutes in front of a closed door to be acknowledged but as soon as we opened the door, we were yelled to close the door and wait outside.  That felt alraedy very rude and we felt chastised like naughty children but we decided to overcome the impulse to leave then and there thinking that the food would reward us.  Guess what? When we were finally seated in a narrow table, we asked for the menu.  At this point, the waitress introduced herself and the fact that this is a family-run business and yadda yadda yadda.  Her family wakes up at dawn to start cooking the delicious meals they are famous for.  At this point, our mouth was watering.  After perusing the few options available that night, I opted for the $22 pizza with burrata \"freshly made with burrata cheese arrived this morning from Italy\". It cannot get better than this, I thought.  A few minutes later, I saw a mini-pizza with burrata cheese being served to the table nearby.  It looked suspiciously like a portion for a child, the pizza was so small.  At this point, I asked the waitress if that was the pizza or a mini portion and she told me \"no, this is the pizza\".  I expressed my honest opinion that the pizza looked too small and asked if I could change my order.  The waitress looked irritated and told me she would ask downstairs.  After several minutes, she came back upstairs and served other tables, before finally making her way towards me.  \"Sorry you cannot change your order, the pizza is in the oven\" she told me.  Determined not to let a series of bad signs ruin my evening, I nodded.  When my pizza arrived, I was again surprised at how small it was.  I am fully Italian, born and raised in Italy, and the pizza I got looked like a smaller version of a piadina.  At my first bite, I realized that: 1. The pizza was not made with dough but with some pre-made flatbread 2. The tomatoes tasted suspiciousy liked canned tomatoes 3. The burrata was half-burrata.  We ate the whole pizza because we hated the thought of throwing away $22 but in our mind we were alreday planning to raid another restaurant as soon as we got out.  We also ordered a dessert which was meh.  When we went downstairs to pay, we saw that the chef was making other pizzas and I clearly saw the flatbread and the canned tomatoes on the counter.  For those who think my review is not kind, go and check my other reviews. I am always honest nad fair in my reviews and consider myself well-travelled and polite. This restaurant let me down and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Hands down, this was one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. Despite the short wait, the experience was great. After befriending another couple in line for the restaurant we shared a table during the meal. In addition to our great dinner companions, the entire place was family run and the service was great. The combination of conviviality  and excellent food is what makes this restaurant stand out."}
{"text":"This was one of my favourite meals in Montreal. Simple, homemade food, at a family-run establishment.  We had reservations for dinner on a cold November night. We were seated upstairs in the loft-style restaurant. There was live music playing downstairs, however we could easily hear everything from the second floor.  Their special soup with homemade bread was delicious. It was the perfect balance between thin and thick, and it was very flavourful and creamy. The waitress advised me that her aunt comes in every morning and makes all the baked goods in-house!  The famous mac and cheese with Christmas ham did not disappoint! It was velvety, sweet, creamy and delicious warm goodness. It is comfort food at its best, and I dream about this dish to this day. Well executed and I can see why it's the best seller on the menu.  The Ultimate Experience: Pork belly with a puree of vegetables was also very good (runner up to Mac and Cheese). I suggest sharing this dish and the mac and cheese with someone, as both can be too rich to indulge by yourself. However, if you are up for the challenge, go for it! Montreal is all about gluttony!  Dessert was nothing to write home about. A simple creme brulee and a bread pudding dish that was forgettable. Service was A+, and the wines and beers were great.  I will return to Le Robin Square soon!"}
{"text":"Robin square was an all around great experience! Had to wait a bit but the staff was super friendly and made the wait totally bearable. Menu is not extensive but what they did have was incredible. Had the Incredible Mac & cheese (which was incredible)- the portion was very generous and reasonably priced. My boyfriend had the pizza, which wasn't very big and a little pricey for the size but it was delicious and the imported cream filled mozzarella was a huge highlight so no complaints! Quaint decor and cozy atmosphere, warm and welcoming staff with elevated comfort food- highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give 6 stars if I could. Great food, fun atmosphere, and run by a charming family. What's not to love!?!"}
{"text":"Their incredible Mac & Cheese was incredibly... sweet. Not quite like a dessert but enough to surprise me. I could not taste truffle and the cheese texture was very creamy. The staff suggest their home made Tobasco sauce which is very good and a much needed addition to balance the sweetness, but of course if you could taste truffle before, there is no way you will anymore. The ham is essentially pulled pork. The place is quite small which is fine as it gives a more homey feel, the music and sound quality was quite good and the staff very friendly. I would likely return to try their other meal unfortunately their Mac & Cheese did not suit my taste."}
{"text":"A wonderful, family owned addition to the old Montreal food scene. The Robin family are all involved in this delightful breakfast and lunch café. The French toast with maple sugar and homemade jam is both rich yet light and leaves you wanting to lick the plate! The quiche filled with leeks, veggies and cheese is delish as well. Open only a few months, the menu focuses on homemade, traditional dishes lovingly prepared by mom and her chef son.  Wish we had known about this little gem before our last day in Montreal"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY worth the wait! AMAZING food and AMAZING service! The Incredible Mac n' Cheese, The Ultimate Experience (pork belly), beef sirloin --- JUST AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious meal here true to the Yelp reviews and spirit of \"unpretentious\" discovery.   We stopped by at around 3pm to scope out the situation and were informed it's low season in Montreal so we shouldn't expect a wait. Score! (Note to others intending to visit the restaurant: BreWsky down the street is a great place to grab drinks beforehand). Also worth noting that an advantage of no reservations means you WILL get seated for sure if you are determined enough.   We returned at 5pm anyway and were two of the first seated. Notably there were still four or five other parties seated at this time and friends who went later that night said the restaurant had run out of a couple things, so still worth thinking about the early bird special even during low season!  Highlights were - as others said - the mac and cheese (covered in braided pork and truffle oil) and the five day pork belly. Rich and delicious, like everything in Montreal.   Service is also exceptional; there's little that can match a family working together to serve dinner in a small capacity environment."}
{"text":"Amazing hidden gem of a place in Montreal. Great brunch, great service from a family-run restaurant. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I arrived at the restaurant at around 5(before the restaurant opened) and there was already a couple of people lined up outside. When 5:15 came, everyone in line was able to fit into the restaurant. Water and forks and knives are set on the table before arrival. The menu is quite small and made ordering somewhat easier. We ordered a foie gras, an ultimate experience, a Mac and cheese, and a calamari. When each dish was brought to the table, the waitress explained every part of the dish.   The foie gras wasn't extraordinarily good and tasted like a butter. The mac and cheese was good by itself, but mixing in the hot sauce made it taste even better. The meat in the mac and cheese was also really good and soft. My favorite dish was the ultimate experience which had pork belly with an apricot and pear sauce and mashed potato with truffle oil. The pork belly was really good and was not at all chewy. The dish that I didn't really like was the calamari. The calamari and the bread that came along with it was nice, but the risotto was super salty.   A lot of the food is prepared in advance, so order quickly if you're one of the first inside the restaurant. We took a while, so all the food that had been prepared was already served to the other tables. Thus, we had to wait a long time for our food. Other than that, the waitress was super friendly and we all had a great time."}
{"text":"Amazing place, great vibes, incredible food and really friendly staff. Came here on my birthday and ended off dinner with their specialty cheesecake and, no exaggeration: best cheesecake I've ever had."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice in March and April 2017 and tried a few of their dishes. Family-run restaurant with very high quality food. We really liked the mac and cheese and the cheese sandwich. The desserts were very tasty too. We sat upstairs both times, which has a cozy atmosphere. The servers were also very nice and helpful. The portions are quite suitable for sharing."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a horrible experience and I will make sure to tell people how stupid the workers think their customers are. First we looked this place up and saw some great reviews not seeing a menu and had some high expectations. We sat down and looked at the menu that has like 7 things on it and we wanted to leave and go somewhere else, not liking the vibe we were getting. I decided to stay and see what the hype was all about and got the beef shoulder and gnocchi. When you order your beef to be medium rare you expect pink with a little blood on the inside. The beef that came was medium well and dry. When we complained the lady actually said that she went to culinary school and knows what medium rare is and that maybe where we come from it's different. I'm 100% positive that medium rare is the same in ANY country you go to Miss Attitude! You didn't offer to give a new piece of meat cooked the way SHE wants it or something else on the menu to compensate for your lack of knowledge of how meat should be cooked. You actually had the nerve to yell WOW after you walked away from our table. We paid $78.87 for 2 of your dishes and walked away with a horrible taste and still hungry. The steamed buns down the street were the only thing that saved the night after experiencing the worst customer service. This tiny place with the smallest menu really needs to work on their egos and satisfying the paying customer. Do not expect the food to be cooked the way you like it, it's the way they like it and will try to make you feel like you don't know how food should look or taste."}
{"text":"Wow.  I think I may have found a new favorite restaurant in Montreal and it's only a 5 minute walk from the hotel that I've been coming to for years.  I'm almost embarrassed that I never found it before but it's definitely better late than never.    I had a feeling I was going to like the place as soon as we had trouble finding the entrance, and once we got inside I was sold. They immediately greeted us and explained their mom and pop style and how all of their dishes are made with love.  Their menu is very small but I'm sure this is so they can pour everything they can into making their dishes perfect.  I started out with the creamy jalapeno soup served with home made bread and I completely devoured it.  I'm sure part of that was the fact that I was starving but the soup and bread were both amazing.  I followed that up with the guineafowl served with homemade gnocchi and butternut squash puree.  The guineafowl actually had a little bit of spice to it which I loved but I thought the gnocchi stole the show.  If I were to find anything to critique, I would say that the guineafowl was a little bit on the dry side, but other than that everything was perfect.  For dessert I ordered the Pudding Au Chomeur which was served with maple syrup and a stick of chocolate, and that disappeared almost as fast as the soup despite the fact that I was stuffed by the time it came out.  Overall, I obviously loved this place.  Le Robin Square is yet another example of why I started using Yelp in the first place.  It's a place that I never would have found on my own and I would have been totally missing out on an awesome hole in the wall. I absolutely can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had a lot of fun at Le Robin Square. The place is a small mom and pop shop and our service was amazing. First of all, they were amazing enough to accommodate us with such a large group of 9 people and no reservation. They quickly shuffled a couple of people around and made it work. The owner and our server was great. Very passionate and talkative. She's a natural sales-person. She had all sorts of bottles of drinks and what not going in no time.  In terms of the food, the onion soup was amazing. It's much different than French Onion soup you have back in the US. It was so good... and what made it great was this apparently secret recipe jalepeno hot sauce with the chef makes. Really delicious. With that, I also had the burrata pizza. That was kind of OK. The cheese was OK, but it was a LOT. Not really what you would expect in a pizza. It was decent overall. On the dessert side... the cheesecake was kind of meh... it comes in a masonry jar with crumbles of crust sort of in there... kind of too creamy for my taste. More like a mousse than a cheesecake. I also tasted someone else's creme brulee, and that was OK.  I think the rest of the guys really enjoyed some of the mean items, like the pork belly, etc. Being a vegetarian, I didn't partake. Overall, it was a fun evening."}
{"text":"Waited outside for a little over an hour on a Saturday night.  Arrived about 10 minutes before the restaurant opened.   Love the family owned business aspect and that everything is made in house!  There's probably 15 tables in there, two levels.    Food was fantastic.  Ordered the Mac and cheese and pork belly, split between two people and the caramel dessert. Pork belly was one of the leanest I've ever had and the Mac and cheese had this delicious cream sauce that I couldn't stop eating despite my lactose intolerance.    The bill came out to $75 usd for two entrees, one dessert, and two drinks.  Overall, great place for dinner!"}
{"text":"New Year's Eve 2018. Got in to Robin Square for dinner. We were very excited. We got a table upstairs, it was comfortable inside for such a cold night. We ordered the crusted brie, the mac n cheese, and this delicious maple cake dessert.   This was one of the best meals of the year for us. The flavors were spot in. Refined comfort food. The crusted brie was genius with the parsnip purée and cranberries on top added the perfect amount of flavor and complexity to an overall simple cheese. The nut bread it was served with added to it perfectly. The mac n cheese with it's hot sauce stir in was incredible. Loved the saucy cheese! And delicious pork.   And let's take a moment to talk about the dessert... it was like the best warmed pancakes with the best maple syrup. Heaven!   Really lovely experience! My only negative comment was the lacking ventilation. My clothes and coat smelled like food and burned oil. It smelled good when we were in there... not so good the next day."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've ever been (easily top 20-25). Great music, venue, and the staff (family) that runs the restaurant are super super friendly. Of everything that we ordered the best plates were: pork belly, Brie cheese with cranberries, Mac and cheese, and the onion soup.  Must go in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great family run restaurant.  Overly delicious food.  Amazing staff.  Cute decor.  The only downside was the size of the menu. There were only 4 items on it when we visited (2 entrees and 2 apps).   Can't wait to go back to try other items!"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, but recommend making reservations first. We first got the Baratta which was tasty, but nothing honestly too too special. What really hit home was the pork belly (the ultimate experience)....and it's quite the experience. Needless to say, I will definitely be getting that next time I come.   Also, of course, got the truffle Mac n cheese with the brisket. This is a fantastic dish, however don't expect your traditional cheesy Mac n cheese, more of a trufffle butter \"pasta\". This isn't a bad means by any means, it'll just help with expectations. The brisket is a good addition to an already heavy dish, but when the brisket is eaten alone, it's nothing special.   Music was a bit louder than desirable to have a pleasant conversation over your meal, but the decorations and staff were friendly. I would say to come and try."}
{"text":"I don't mind waiting 40 minutes for a table for 3 (Which was actually a table for two with a stool added). They did say they were working on a new location. The Mac and Cheese was like a bowl of dog food. A mound of store bought pasta that is sweetened with cream and topped by some sort of shredded beef (I guess that's Poutine or whatever it's called). My friends from Canada say they are offended that that is the national dish.  I'm sure this \"family of chef's\" can come up with better. Any fan of normal mac and cheese should avoid this at all costs because it's hardly cheese. I'm not sure where the good reviews of this dish are coming from but everyone has their own preferences on taste. $18 for that was offensive too.  Pork Belly was done well, although poorly plated. They just poured 2 or 3 sauces right on the plate beside it so they just started to combine. Maybe it was two sauces that mixed to become a 3rd.  The 3rd person in our party had the Salmon. It looked well prepared and she finished it so I'm assuming it was good. I guess I was really hoping to find a small family owned French restaurant that was either more innovative or more classic. No something in the middle like sauce I was eating with my pork.  Overall if you're looking for a great French food experience in Montreal, ignore the $$ and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I will caveat that I had my meal at their old location on Saint Laurent on 1/4/18, but it was such a phenomenal meal that I have no doubts that that things will remain the same, or even better than before, at their new location.   I was visiting Montreal with a couple other people and we ordered food to share: soup of the day (onion bisque/chowder), the Mac and Cheese, and Ultimate Experience. These are their two most popular items and are permanent offerings.   The soup was good and offered something texturally different from everything else that we ordered. It was good soup, but pales in comparison to what arrived at our table next.   The Mac n Cheese had this terrific mix of sweet/savory that is honestly just hard to describe properly. It definitely ends up being on the sweeter side, and is also more cream sauce like than sticky cheese, but just so wonderful.   The Ultimate Experience was personally my favorite and was something I was kind of sad to share. The pork belly is braised for several days and is so soft that it just falls apart when you slice into it. I think it's the best pork belly I've ever had in my life, and this is coming from a girl who thinks that no one can cook as well as her mom. I don't think my mom has ever made pork belly this soft. I will say that if you're not a huge fan of fatty meats, you probably won't enjoy this pork belly...but I'm not sure why you would get pork belly if you don't like fatty meats.   For dessert, we got two of their three offerings: cheesecake with a mango puree/layer in a mason jar and a Quebec dessert, poudin chomeur (I can only spell it because I fell in love at first bite and had to google it). Poudin chomeur is a white cake that has been soaked in maple syrup. It was served warm and oh my gosh. It was like the best, fluffiest pancake I ever had, but only the fluff. The only thing I didn't like about this dessert is that I know I'll never find another poudin chomeur that will ever live up to this very first time.   Literally one of the best meals I've ever had and would 200% make the effort to come back the next time I'm in Montreal! A little pricier than your average meal, but is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing people, amazing service. We were welcomed with smiling faces and then served amazing food. This is a family ran business and that's exactly how you feel being there. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Montreal or Old Montreal!!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday evening around 9.  Ambiance: Place is dim with chill vibe; seating is available upstairs and downstairs.  Service: Expect to wait at least 15 minutes before you're seated. It it's a little annoying that they don't have a larger space for you to stand while you wait (you have to wait in the hall). However, the staff was super nice and kept checking in with us. We got to meet the chef who was cool. I like the intro they give you about the restaurant.  Food: The boyfriend had the soup of the day which was creamy and cheesy. He loved it but I'm just not into creamy soups. The calamari with risotto was amazing but the boyfriend thought it was okay. On the other hand, I thought the mac and cheese was okay and the bf loved it. We also got the brownie dessert to go; it's really rich and should be served with ice cream so I got some vanilla ice cream at the store, microwave the cake and topped it ice cream. If you're eating it there, ask them if they have ice cream.  Overall, this was one of the best restaurants during our visit in Montreal."}
{"text":"I had the pork belly and it was one of the most amazing dish I have ever tried. I also tried the Mac and cheese and it was excellent as well.  Be prepared to wait a lot for the table and the food. The place is quite full all the time."}
{"text":"We visited this hidden gem during a conference in Montreal. Having read Yelp reviews, we knew to get there early and to order the Mac and cheese. And Oh. My. God. Was it delicious! The salty-sweet \"Christmas ham\" on top combined with the cream based sauce and truffle oil to create a unique flavor I had never before encountered. Every now and then I would crunch on a salt crystal. Unreal. Paired w a local blond beer, this was my favorite meal in Montreal hands down. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best meals my wife and I have ever had. Small, family run, casual place. Pork belly was extremely tender, and pizza special of the night was amazing. Great service too! Will definitely be back next time we visit old Montreal."}
{"text":"The mac and cheese was smoky and savory especially with the hot sauces (on the side). And the pork belly was cooked perfectly and tasted heavenly! It was an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Well, for the most part, I have never met a meal I didn't like. I'm certainly no foodie, but I believe wholeheartedly in trusting Yelp and the Foodies on that site to steer me in the right direction.  Finding myself in Montreal and not knowing anything around here, I went to Yelp. I thankfully got steered to this place. It's an amazing family-run business where everything is freshly made and the owners will likely introduce you to their relatives that cook your food. It's a small place, so don't be surprised if you're eating right next to your neighbor, but it works. The staff is incredibly friendly! I went with the mac and cheese and it did was excellent. Definitely on the sweet side, but if you get the hot sauce they provide and mix them together it makes for a nice balance.  Definitely give this place a shot when you're in Montreal! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We headed over around 7pm and waited in a line outside the restaurant for 30 minutes. They don't take any reservations. It's not too bad of a wait if you're a party of 2. It's a pretty tiny restaurant with only 6 tables downstairs but they also have an upstairs area. We decided to order the famous mac & cheese as well as the pizza with fresh burrata cheese.   This truly was an incredible meal with HUGE portion sizes! We ended up taking a lot home and it still tasted amazing the next day. The fresh burrata cheese on our pizza was simply divine. We were instructed to spread it over our pizza and it was all gooey and delicious (: The mac & cheese was the perfect combo of sweet and salty.   It's definitely worth the wait!!! The best part is that their ingredients are home-grown or locally bought and it's a family run business. They took the time to introduce themselves to us and got to know us better which was really sweet. We regret not going back again before we left Montreal!"}
{"text":"On the way back from the port, it started snowing. and it was hella windy. I pulled up yelp and found this place and we sprinted inside to the warmth. There's not as much for vegetarians here (kind of like all Montreal, tbh). My wife and I split the swagger platter, which had some great cheeses. She also had the creamed cauliflower soup that she loved and another vegetable dish. I don't remember the name of the dish I had, but it was so delicious- it was foie gras, bacon, and cheese on top of each other. Holy crap man it was like a perfect combination of salty, sweet, meaty, umami- every good flavor. We ended with a matcha creme brulee, which was one of the better desserts I've had ever."}
{"text":"Family-owned business, friendly servers, fabulous food!  Arrived around 6:15pm on a Thursday evening, seated right away. The place definitely filled up by the time we left, though! No reservations, so go early or plan to wait.  Waiters & waitresses were super open and helpful, explaining restaurant history and the handful of menu options. Food came out a bit slowly but boy, was it GOOD. I had the mac & cheese without meat and the spices were golden. Others in my family shared mac and cheese with meat, pork belly, and beef shoulder. Ask for extra slices of their homemade bread, each is only $0.75.  By the end of the evening, we all agreed the food was superb and the whole experience was very worth the $100+ spent! I'd say it was the best meal of my Montreal vacation :)"}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal this past weekend. It was our first time there and we were looking for a dinner spot and saw this place on yelp. I was reading through the reviews and almost every single review was 5 stars. How can it be? 5 Stars on every review? Because it really is that good.  This is place is pretty small but there are a few tables upstairs to eat as well. We walked in around 7:30 on a Saturday night and were able to be seated right away. We did not have reservations. When you first walk into this place you will think to your self \" this place doesn't look at that great\" but, looks can be deceiving my friend. Its not dirty or anything the place just looks like an average restaurant.   We sat up stairs and we had the most wonderful waitress, I wish I could remember her name. She explained to us how the restaurant was family owned and run and she got the job because she was a family friend. She also explained how all the ingredients and food they use come from local places! It was like getting a little history lesson on the restaurant before dinner which I thought was a very nice touch.   Our waitress was also able to recommend some beers that we make like. I went with the amber and thought it was perfect. Partner went with the blonde, and he enjoyed it as well. I cant remember the names!    The menu is extremely limited with only 3 entrees. I had the Beef belly and my partner had the pasta dish(Black Truffle Rigatoni ). I just want to say, I think this is the best meal I have ever eaten. The beef belly was served with celery root puree and an apricot puree but you didn't even need it. The meat was so flavorful and tender. You can literally cut it with a spoon if you wanted to. The sever told us it actually takes a few days to make this. The pasta dish was also amazing! It was cheesy and creamy and the maple smoked meat made a great addition. I am really not a pasta guy but I really enjoyed this dish. Also each dish is served with a slice of home made bread which is also amazing. The beef dish was served with regular French bread and the pasta dish was served with a walnut bread.  The whole weekend we rant and raved to each other on how good the food was here. Every restaurant we went to over the next few days we tried to compare to this place and it's was almost like nothing could measure up. I will be back to this place for sure during my summer trip to Montreal! I would defiantly recommend this place to anybody!"}
{"text":"In downtown Montreal for a work conference.  Seeing that this restaurant had received very high ratings, I knew I had to visit for dinner.  I was not disappointed.    I had to have their signature Mac & Cheese.  See photo.  They suggested the hot sauce to go with it.  I tried the mild & hot. (There is a very hot) I'm glad I tried both as I could sample each with different bites to see which I preferred.  The mild adds a little sweetness.  The hot gives it a kick.  Both were good and I would recommend them.   Small, but nice selection of local craft beers.  I tried the two types of local IPA beers they had, which were both very good.  As other reviewers have stated, the restaurant is family owned and operated.  My only negative is that it was very very warm in the restaurant on my visit.  Seats maybe 20 on the lower level and maybe around the same on the upper level.  I understand that they are going to be moving to a new larger space soon.  I love the David Bowie painting on the wall in the lower level (see photo).  This is a fun little place with friendly staff and great food.  What more could you want."}
{"text":"I had a really good meal here on my birthday, which occurred while I was on my honeymoon in Montreal. The food was delicious -- the mac and cheese was as good as promised -- and the atmosphere and service were excellent: homey and friendly. They were even kind enough to send me a complimentary dessert (a truly excellent pot of \"cheesecake\") for my birthday. I can't wait to come back to Montreal and eat here again."}
{"text":"Food was not nearly as delicious as described in previous reviews. The mac and cheese was incredibly sweet. We only managed to eat half of it due to the overpowering sweetness. Additionally, two out of the already few menu items were unavailable.  Interior was small and there was a pungent fishy smell that made for an unappetizing environment.   Service was good.  This place is nowhere near a top establishment in Montreal."}
{"text":"What a lovely evening on our first night in Montreal!  We were greeted by such friendly staff and the owner. That night it was the sister-brother team working the restaurant. The sister took the time to explain the menu and make recommendations after asking our dining preferences. As we waited for each course, we enjoyed listening about the restaurant, her brother the chef, their family love and cooking expertise, their family holiday meals of which the menu is based and the sights that make Montreal special as we told them it was our first visit to this part of Canada.  The sister even took the time to write a list of places to see which I am sure will make our vacation more intriguing as we venture outside of Vieux Montreal in the next few days.  Amazingly, when we walked into the restaurant after researching it on Yelp, we were only expecting to try a few Canadian dishes, but we received so much more than good food. We felt like guests in \"their home\".   The Mac n' Cheese lived up to all the rave reviews on Yelp. I am still thinking about the creaminess (with a tinge of garlic)  and slight saltiness of the Christmas ham that blended well with the elbow macaroni.  I am seriously thinking of stopping by again just to get a large bowl to take home!  The other entrees (Ultimate Experience with pork belly and the skirt steak with mashed potatoes) were indeed very comforting to us.  The truffle celery root purée and pear jam offset the super richness of the pork belly in the Ultimate Experience. The Beef Skirt was fantastic served with bacon mashed potatoes (my daughter dug into it so quickly!) and pea purée. They served family style, so we may share the joy of each dish.  My husband and daughter enjoyed the maple syrup vanilla cake as dessert.  With a touch of melted dark chocolate I was pleased with it too.   Another plus was the live Cuban music on a Tuesday night. The gentlemen gave such a cool vibe to the place without being overbearingly loud as I have experienced in other restaurants.   Je vous remercie pour un tel repas fabuleux et soir!"}
{"text":"Looking for something around our hotel ( Le St-Suplice ) came across reviews for this place. Called ahead to make sure there was room, she assured me they had a table for 2 right away. The place is small and intimate and family run. Staff is super friendly. But best of all, the food was amazing. I had the pork belly which was crispy on top, buttery in the middle and all around delicious. My wife had the beef bourgignon which was ridiculously tender and tasty. I'd recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Hands down 5 stars. Family owned place, fresh ingredients. Spectacular service. One of my top 10 dining experiences. Not pretentious at all; just a quality place with excellent food. I recommend this to anyone. I had the beef shoulder. It was perfectly cooked with pea purée that I could lick off of the plate. My bf had the mac n cheese. Not at all traditional mac n cheese. The spices on the ham were unique and the blend was creative and delicious. Only thing is beware of the hot sauce. It's super spicy so don't load food with it before tasting a small dab first. Kudos to this family establishment!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing!   The Mac and Cheese exceeded our expectations and the Pork Belly blew us away.  We want to come back just to have that again.  The atmosphere is great (especially the music) and it really feels like you're eating at someone's home.  It's family owned and the staff takes great pride in providing an excellent experience overall."}
{"text":"This was another surprise we found real close to our hotel.  First off Sylvia and her chef brother (can't remember his name) were just awesome people.  They truly made me feel like I was home.  We ended up ordering a bunch of entrees and doing it family style.  Their Mom makes her home made cheese daily and it came with the beet salad (yummy).  Everything was just perfect!!  Sylvia - good luck with the puppy and don't listen to my friends.  I love to share!  :-)"}
{"text":"How do you write a review when there are no words to describe the utmost deliciousness of the food at a family owned restaurant like Le Robin Square? One simply cannot do justice to the food here because it's so outrageously delicious that the right words don't exist.  I should end it there but let me give this review a shot:  Ambience: visited when they were at their original location (they've now moved to a bigger space) and the two floor restaurant was cute beyond words. Cozy and cute would be my description. 5/5  Staff: given that everyone who works here is related, the staff is lovely to deal with. They're warm, friendly, and personable leaving you wanting to befriend them all. 5/5  Food: oh, the food...... mom and brother make the majority of the dishes and they are seriously outstanding. The mac and cheese with ham is literally the best I've ever had in my entire life!!! I can't even describe it to you but this is one dish you need to ignore calories/health/weight for and simply enjoy to your hearts content because I highly doubt that you'll be able to replicate it at home (sorry to all the master chefs at home but trust me...this dish is on another level). The crispy pork belly with celery root purée is also something to write home about: perfectly cooked and super yummy... that celery root purée is one which I want to eat everyday of my life..... 10 stars out of 5 for the food here!!  Price: very fair for what you get although I've noticed that they've now increased the price of some of their dishes by up to $7 (I guess due to popularity)!  All in all, one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal! Can't wait to check out their new location!"}
{"text":"Visiting on a Thursday night around 8, we expected that there might be a wait- but not at all! The inside is low-key enough to not be pretentious, and definitely nice enough for a date. The staff is super friendly, including the member of the Robin family that we had the pleasure of meeting.   The menu is small, but because every single item sounded amazing, it wasn't an issue at all. (However, I don't recommend it for vegans.) The Mac & cheese with the pork was INCREDIBLE, and the portion size very generous with both pasta and meat. The sauce was cheesy and the meat added a savory, caramélised punch to the whole dish. The soup was so good that we nearly ordered another (we split one). For entrees, we picked the Beef Skirt  and the Ultimate Experience pork belly. Both dishes were amazing, right down the the braises, sauces, and even the pea purée. Wow. The beef skirt in particular was cooked perfectly sous vide, coming out extremely tender, and the red wine sauce was so good that we asked for more. Great local dinner spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place.   I had the pasta special: it was hands down the best pasta dish I've ever had anywhere ever.   Really great service, really friendly staff, and a nice, relaxed environment. Can't recommend highly enough. Stunning food. Will be coming back before heading off to London."}
{"text":"Makes you want to live a better life...because they will be serving the menu from Le Robin Square in heaven! The food was a delicate delivery of a sophisticated flavor pallet in a very hardy menu of Pork Belly and Mac & Cheese. The staff cares for their customers...this is a family restaurant that treats each guest like a member of the family. Get there fast and get a piece of heaven!!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is wonderful. We ordered the Mac N Cheese and the rib sandwich. Both were very tasty - and large portions, also. What a great meal. The service (all a family) was so much fun, also. I will return!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and homemade food make for a great combination. Staff does an excellent job managing its small restaurant and seating people quickly. My only suggestion would be that this is more of a $$$ restaurant than a $$ one, but the food is delicious and worth paying for."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Really nothing else to say. Small space and small menu (just 3 entrees), but everything from start to finish was excellent! We came in late on Saturday with no reservations and had seats within 10 minutes. Drinks and service were great as well!"}
{"text":"Family owned hole in the wall. Good food, good mixed drinks, responsive service.  Limited seated. Nice if you want to experience some local Montreal flavor."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here during a snowstorm, craving an intimate and cozy dinner, and they delivered. The space was inviting, and the staff was friendly - the friendliest I have experienced thus far while visiting Montreal. We had our 10-month-old son with us, and they were accommodating to his needs, providing a booster seat and even a piece of bread that he could nibble on. For our meals, we had our eye on the Mac and Cheese, and ended up getting that and splitting the Pork Belly. It didn't disappoint. The Mac and Cheese flavors were out of this world, and I love the black truffle top note. And the Pork Belly. Wow, it just melted in your mouth!  The server also recommended a wine pairing that suited the meal perfectly. We can't wait to go back when we return to Montreal. The staff and owners were kind, treated us like family, and the food was exceptional. You can't beat that combo!"}
{"text":"We read the reviews and decided to try it out. A quirky feel good atmosphere with the whole family working hard to deliver a great dining experience.  Silvia was our server and was very friendly, helpful,  and full of positive energy. We had the pork belly, (excellent) a side salad of arugula  (very nice), goat cheese tart, (sun dried tomatoes were homemade and amazing). Dessert was a fantastic piece of cake soaked in maple syrup accompanied with chocolate pieces. What a perfect end to a great meal.  A great family business with fabulous food crafted with care. Well worth trying out...We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not much bad to say about robins square. Every review is good. Family owned and we took a great pic with one of the owners. Speaks highly of a business where the owners take time to explain the food history, and their business ventures. Food was delicious, great creations by a tireless chef.  The wait outside is worth it, can be hours at times. The portions also wuite huge. Great local food. Charming delicious stop"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem strolling through the streets of old Montreal. Excellent meal from start to finish. Service was great. Food was delicious. Prices were reasonable. Le Robin Square was one of our best meals in Montreal. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"What an amazing meal!  We ordered four of the seven menu items & were overwhelmed with flavors, richness and the delicate complexity of the local foods. It is a small menu & we would have ordered everything if we were a larger group.  Fantastic service, well chosen wines - will definitely return for the warmer weather menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mac n cheese, great service! Also ordered pork belly. It was good but I liked the Mac n cheese with mild and medium hot sauce better.  Beer and wine selections good match for the food. Enjoyed the maple cake with warm syrup. Cozy."}
{"text":"New to Montreal, we turned to Yelp for neighborhood suggestions. The pork belly and mac 'n cheese dishes were so tasty. Despite the somewhat steep prices, we enjoyed our entrees very much.  To top it all off, their pistachio creme brûlée was yum, extreme caramelized crust.   The service was of course wonderful. The only reason why I can't give 5 stars was the small space."}
{"text":"Great food, not too long a wait on a Tuesday night. Friendly staff, small space.  Only complaint by one of our party who doesn't particularity like truffle oil, is that it is in almost every dish."}
{"text":"My friend was visiting Montreal and I took him to this place because I read the reviews on Yelp. I ordered the famous Mac n cheese and my friend ordered beef brisket. He loved the beef brisket very much and could not stop talking about it. I liked the Mac n cheese but after eating around half, I felt like it was too creamy/greasy so I did not finish all of it. It was still good I think. It is just that I could not eat a lot. After that, we ordered a cheesecake. It has a different flavor. I thought it was a little too sweet. I really like the ambience and the service. We met the owners, brother and sister. I can't believe they are only in their twenties. Overall it was a good dining experience!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was amazing! I've never had a dish that could surprise me so much. The sauce combination were ridiculous at first sight but then found a great balance."}
{"text":"Solid!!! I wish I had enough room for one or two more items... I had the calamari dish (seasonal) which was full of complex flavors. I really like that the meat and seafood entrees were done sous vide (which is a rare treat for an American). I also had the warm maple cake which tasted just like pancakes! Sylvia was wonderful and very attentive.  She lets you taste wine so you know which one you really want.  She was so pleasant that we chatted for a while.  The atmosphere was very nice. The restaurant is a bit small. I was able to get in for a Friday evening dinner."}
{"text":"I don't know if I should start raving on the food or the staff... The food was delicious. I'm not sure if I would classify it was \"French,\" but it was tasty nonetheless. I had the Mac and Cheese, which was amazing-- sweet and creamy and very filling. My husband had the pork belly, which was equally as delicious. The staff was the nicest we experienced our entire time in Montreal. Our server was very friendly and bubbly. After ordering the owner came back to check on our table. She was very welcoming as well. She went around to everyone saying hi and bragging on her kitchen and wait staff. The only down side is that it is a small place, so expect to wait, but it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"First off, we did not have a reservation (not a smart idea). We were seated anyway. They fit us in no problem. Service was impeccable. Atmosphere was amazing. Business casual was the attire of the patrons and employees. Drinks were great. Food was some of the best I've ever had. The brisket macaroni and cheese melted in your mouth like butter. The pork belly was tender flavorful and seasoned perfectly. The chocolate cake with citrus sauce was other worldly. Overall an absolutely unreal experience. A trip to Montréal with this restaurant is a trip wasted."}
{"text":"On the basis of other Yelp users I went for lunch at Robin Square. From the moment we walked in we felt welcomed. The restaurant is a family run affair (Robin being the last name). The wait staff was friendly and helpful. The menu is not large but all of the food is locally sourced and excellently executed.   I started with the Celery Root, Pear and Cauliflower soup. I wish the bowel was larger. Then I had their Redneck sandwich - a large portion of pulled pork in between to thick slices of freshly backed bread and a side salad. It was SO GOOD!   This is one of the better restaurants I've been to and it was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars, if ever... and I think it takes A LOT for a place to receive 5 stars. I'll start the food. The pork belly meal was absolutely incredible, scrumptious, impeccable, and the vegetable sauces they added on the side were bursting with amazing flavors. The mac n cheese was amazing too. This is by far the best meal I've ever had at a restaurant - my boyfriend said the same thing.   Now for the service... from the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm welcomes - especially nice since we walked all day long and were exhausted. Our server was so attentive, knowledgeable and very very sweet. I forget her name (sorry I remember faces!), but she was one of the best servers I had - more like treatment from a good friend.   The owner came over and greeted us at the end, really showing care about our meal. This is rare - she took the time to write down A TON of places we should visit. She asked specific questions and made a list based on our needs. So nice too.  If you come to Montreal and you don't go here, you're crazy! It's a MUST, if the ONLY place you go."}
{"text":"Hubs and I went to Le Robin Square for dinner, our first night in Montreal.  This meal was the highlight of our trip.  The restaurant was around the corner from our apartment, in a cute, intimate space.  We sat upstairs at the table that looks down on the kitchen, it is the best view in the house.  I love to eat and eat well.  My new friend Sylvie had me at \"my brother brines, smokes, then braises the pork belly\".   It was music to my ears.  I heard nothing else, and got that.  Hubs got the pizza with the ENORMOUS chunk of fresh burrata.  The huge serving of pork belly comes with an amazing sauce, and is accompanied by a very rich celery root puree that oozes truffles.  It is a rich dish, perfect for a cold Montreal evening, accompanied by some very nice red wine.    The service at Le Robin is spectacular, we were well attended to, and everyone was very cheerful, clearly enjoying their work at this amazing restaurant.  Sylvie, the owner, is incredibly charming, and will make sure that you have a most unforgettable experience.  I absolutely love, love, love Le Robin Square, and it will be my first destination, the next time I am in beautiful Montreal."}
{"text":"I completely enjoyed my experience at Robin Square.  I was met by a very kind and beautiful hostess who seated me at the bar and welcomed me to Montreal.  The bartender explained the menu and I was immediately sold on the Ultimate Experience which turned out to be just that, living up to the name.  I started with the cauliflower soup which was a perfect blend of richness, creaminess, and spice.  As I worked on my starter and chatted with the bartender, I couldn't help but notice his attention to detail on every cocktail produced.  Each was prepared as an individual work of art.  I'm not usually one for cocktails due to poor past experiences, but decided I could trust this gentleman to get it right.  I chose the Pearfection, made with cognac and bourbon.  It was just pearfect :).  Great meal, great ambiance, most excellent service.  If you find yourself in Montreal, you could not go wrong giving this fine family establishment a visit.  Thanks again for a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting from Austin, TX for 5 days, and this was the best restaurant experience we had. Their food is well prepared, the server was one of the daughters, and they explained everything on the menu so well. We had a cream of onion soup that was ridiculously good, along with some homemade bread. The pork belly is cooked over 5 days - and it is melt-in-your-mouth good. The items that go along with it pair so well. They also had a section of local microbrews, which was nice."}
{"text":"Friendly (ridiculously) nice people.  Great menu.  Cheery restaurant.  Great food.  Playful menu"}
{"text":"The best Mac and cheese I will ever have in my life.  Very cool small place, tasty dishes, smells amazing the second you walk in.  Should be on everyone's must go to list."}
{"text":"This food was delicious. The service was fantastic. This was a true home cooked meal in the middle of Old Montreal. I have been in Montreal for 3 nights and this was by far the best meal of the trip. Price was a little on the high side but definitely worth every penny. I highly recommend this restaurant. There is not a single bad thing to say."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Located in touristy old Montreal, it is tucked away as a sliver between buildings. There is not that much seating room so go at a good time because there may be a wait. The mac and cheese is unique and creamy. It is topped with extremely tender pork. My one note is that it was kind of not room temperature than hot. The burrata pizza is probably the best pizza I have ever eaten. Love it and love the staff!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, they also changed their menu from what is online and they didn't have anything we wanted when we went there."}
{"text":"This is the best experience i've ever had with mac and cheese!!! The texture was really good and the flavours of the truffle and maple syrup where absolutely insane ! The service was amazing very warm ! Its a family business and the team that have created is so strong that you can feel it in their hospitality ! Def coming back !"}
{"text":"Excellent Food & Friendly Services!! Beware the place is small and doesn't take reservation. There is only maybe 10 tables, and they are small & efficient. Thus, if you have a large group and/or with small children, be sure you go earlier because you maybe waiting for a while. By the way, there is no so-called \"waiting area\". Just a small vestibule or wait outside...(meaning it's going to be cold when you're there during the winter season.) Regardless, the food is wonderful & fresh, and the service is also wonderful. One other point to mention is that the menu is small, not a large selections. However, everything is great and come with love."}
{"text":"The pork belly is delicious! It just melts in your mouth. The 3 sauces that come with it, all tastes so different but all so good with the pork. Definitely recommend that! The mac and cheese was good, which my friends got, but I would much rather have the pork."}
{"text":"Came here late on a Monday night, it was pretty empty. We sat beside the window and our waitress, Romy was so nice! We had the pork belly, the mac n cheese with a side of foie gras. The foie gras was really good, and a very generous portion. The pork belly was amazing, but the mac n cheese was TO DIE FOR. Definitely a staple to go to in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Completely blown away by this place. I've heard Montreal has great food but never experienced it until now. The service is unbeatable and the food has the best flavour combinations I've experienced."}
{"text":"Went here on our trip to Montreal. The place is cozy and the owner is very friendly. We order fogra for appetizer and it was amazing. We also order pork belly and Mac and Cheese. The food is not bad. Maybe I'm not a big fan for sweet Mac N cheese. Overall we had a good experience there."}
{"text":"This place had an amazing review from the yelp elite before we went, and it still surpassed my expectations. Truffled pork Mac and cheese was amazing; as was the pork belly. The pork belly had all the fattiness and melt in your mouth goodness it usually does but they left it attached to a hunk of normal pork loin instead of shaving it to a half inch thickness (was about 2 inches of meat). This pork was also perfectly cooked and balanced the fattiness. On a bed of truffle celeriac puree and pear puree which added a nice contrast.  Also, arrived at 9 pm (closes at 10) on a Wednesday and for two we had no wait. So later at night mid week seems to be a good time. Finished with the Quebec bread pudding which was also delicious. Overall awesome food quality, with great value. About $90 for two mains, two beers, a dessert and a solid tip."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent environment, excellent service. Oh, and the dessert is amazing too. Poor man's pudding and creme brulee are delicious"}
{"text":"Its good comfort food at luxury food prices.  Not worth imho. Appeals to hipsters."}
{"text":"Went here based on reviews: the good: super friendly service, quality, well constructed dishes suitable for a foodie. The negatives: place really small, a little tight although some might find this more intimate. The menu was limited with only about 5 mains- from a foodie perspective, not necessarily bad as it is better to master a few dishes, but I felt constricted because I don't eat pork and really wanted to get the mac and cheese everyone raves about. The beef shoulder was very good, nicely presented. Drink menu limited but decent. Price was fair."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. The staff was super nice and friendly and the atmosphere was cozy yet modern. The Guinea Fowl was delish, and the Mac and cheese with ham was also good. Finally, the selection of local beer  was really cool. Great vibe; I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Le Robin Square is absolutely phenomenal and definitely one of the rare gems in Montreal. This place is really the best: from amazing service to the delicious food. I have been here twice and is definitely looking to go more in the future. This family-run restaurant has both the homey, cozy ambiance and the expertise of a refined bistro.   I love their melt-in-your mouth pork belly, the creative mac-and-cheese, and especially the tender beef brisket. Their selective menu really brings out the wonderful uniqueness of each dish, and we have of coursed tried it all (even that home-made hot sauce is a really great bonus as well). Also, don't forget to save some of the tummy for their delicious dessert! I especially love their apple pie and le pouding chômeur.   All in all, this has been the best restaurant discovery in Montreal. I have recommended this place to my friends and family. I absolutely adore the staff and the dishes, and it is definitely a restaurant worth frequenting."}
{"text":"The pork belly, macaroni and cheese, as well as the deserts were the best!  Definitely would recommend people to try these dishes.  The owners are in the restaurant working hard everyday to ensure that you get the best experience.  They recommended that we do family style with our meals, and that's what we did.  It worked out perfectly!  They also ensure that all of their food comes from local sources and are organic as well.  They are definitely worth every dollar spent here.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Wonderful wonderful pasta, Mac N cheese, grilled cheese, spinach salad - all the food was delicious. Go."}
{"text":"Wholly worth the wait, we had the mac and cheese and pizza. I would try to characterize the flavor but am at a loss for words. The owner was very engaging and made us feel like part of the Robin family. If were ever in Montreal again this will be at the top of our list to enjoy dinner."}
{"text":"Incredible food. The mac and cheese was completely out of this world. The asparagus soup and Pork belly were both delicious as well. We made sure to arrive around 530 to be one of the first people in line as the wait times between 6 and 10 look like they could be an hour or more since it's a relatively small restaurant. It looks like the staff really cares about their craft and the food reflects all of the love and care from this family run business. A must go to place in Montreal"}
{"text":"Really a nice find.  The food was exceptional and the service was superlative. For our visit, the wait staff and owner went out of their way to create a comfortable family atmosphere. They want you to feel at home. Mom makes the bread and desserts fresh every day.  The place is family run and it comes across well. I had the pork belly- fabulous. It is small and so big parties should call ahead."}
{"text":"Long wait but totally worth it! The family run business has great people who care about every dish they make and ensuring you are happy. The owner gave my family a description of every dish they make and how it is all family who work there. Every new dish that we received was phenomenal! Have never been to a restaurant where I liked everything that I got!"}
{"text":"Canadian (New) cuisine... now that's something you don't find everyday in NYC.   Signature dishes at Le Robin Square-- Incredible Mac & Cheese and The Ultimate Experience are must-try!  Blue Cheese & Celery soup of the day is good to share. It would too much for one person and likely overdose with cheese if you want to try Incredible Mac & Cheese too.   Foie Gras Mi-Cuit and Dried Duck Magret is very crisp, clean tasting with multiple layers of depth and flavor.  Incredible Mac & Cheese is different from typical flavor. It's slightly sweet and not overly cheesey and heavy. Plus the special hot sauce, it's super tasty!  Pork belly skin from the Ultimate Experience is packed with flavors. Could be a little more tender, but it's well balanced with everything else on the plate.  Light and satisfying desserts... wrapped it up with Pistachio Creme Brulee and Mango Cheesecake.  Super friendly staffs and host! Awesome music playlist!"}
{"text":"Great family eatablishment - get yummy food here. The portions are huge and the staff are so friendly - food is very shareable."}
{"text":"Waited two hours in line, definitely worth the wait.  You guys have to try the pork belly.  Being from Toronto,  I would have to say this has to be the best pork bellys I have ever tried.  The Mac and cheese is also very good too!!  Next time I come back to Montreal,  I will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"It was my last night of vacation in Montreal.  I wanted to go to a great restaurant.  I read about Le Robin Square on Yelp.  I also realized that there might be a wait and it was a 30 minute walk from my hotel.  I decided it to give it a try.  I did have a back up incase there was a line.  It has a non-descript front that one could pass easily, as I did.  But there was a live Latin duo performing and I realized that was the place.  No line on Wednesday night.  No waiting at all.  I was asked if I wanted to sit downstairs, but that was 3' from the music.  I opted to sit upstairs.  I was the only one upstairs.  I was quickly met by Robin, the namesake of the establishment.  She told me the story of the restaurant that has been mentioned in previous reviews.  No problem with English as the staff speaks better English at staff at a lot of American restaurants do.  Plus the menu is in English (French on the other side).  Robin recommended a local IPA and the Mac-n-Cheese.  I went with her recommendations.  The IPA was good, the mac-n-cheese was one of the best dishes I have had in recent memory.  They don't use cheese, but make the pasta in cream.  They then add braised pork belly on top.    I truly didn't want the dish to end.  I was still the only one sitting upstairs, but Robin kept checking on me.  So spirited she is.  For dessert, Robin recommended the apple and cheesecake tart.  It was great.  She told me to eat it from the crust to the tip.  When I was finished, she came up with another dessert.  She was all apologies as she said the crust of my dessert was not up to their restaurant's standards.  Pretty high standards!  She gave me a gratis serving of their cake that is soaked in maple syrup and other good things.  It was like the best bread pudding that you could imagine.  I didn't want my dinner to end, but I knew I wanted to get back to the hotel to watch Game 7 of the World Series.    The dinner was inexpensive compared to a lot of restaurants. This restaurant in itself would make me want to come back to Montreal.    Go during the week.  But it you are caught in line, the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and delightful waitstaff.  We started with the delicious potato leek soup, served piping hot, and then segued to the beef shoulder, cooked sous-vide, accompanied by the most amazing cheese polenta, pan seared mushrooms, and topped off with a small pitcher of exquisite red wine sauce.  We shamelessly licked the plate!  Dinner was not complete without the yummy creme brûlée.  Stay at the Hotel William Gray and do the easy walk to this hole-in-the-wall gem for a dinner to remember."}
{"text":"OK - this is THE restaurant to hit in Montreal!  Amazing wait staff that is extremely friendly, helpful and clearly enjoy their job.  A menu that is excellently put together - short but well thought out.  And finally the most important thing - amazing food that hits all the right notes.  A foodies haven!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came to Montreal for a vacation. We found the service top notch and very helpful. We ordered the Mac and cheese and cream of cauliflower soup. We found both very good and enjoyed them. They have special hot sauces to go with the Mac and cheese which were very good. The Mac and cheese is a very big portion and my wife and I found it more than adequate for both of us (we took the leftovers home). Great ambiance with a view of city hall, too."}
{"text":"This place is simply incredible. The menu is limited, but each item I had was delicious. The Mac and cheese is quite sweet, but you can order it without the ham to offset that (but why....). The service was phenomenal, and they speak perfect English to offset my cultural ignorance to the French language. The restaurant is quite small. Expect to wait if you don't plan out your visit!  My only complaint (if I'm going to nitpick) was the chairs are a little wobbly and I felt like I could fall out of it at any moment's notice.   But again, the food. Man."}
{"text":"Wow! My girlfriend and I were in Vieux Port, and we knew we had to come here. We came on a Friday evening, and we only waited about 10 minutes, despite them being one of the most highly regarded restaurants in the city. The moment we entered the first door, we noticed that the second had a sign that asked restaurant goers to wait between the doors as there isn't much space inside. However, a driver greeted us immediately and gave an estimate on how much longer we had to wait. She quoted us 30 minutes, but she gave us the option of taking bar seats if we wanted to be seated immediately. Because we were famished, we took the bar seats.   The inside of the restaurant is quite small, but feels homey. There is a TV that played a video of a beach view, and the music was instrumental and not too loud. The lighting in the restaurant was low, so there was an overall subdued atmosphere.   My girlfriend ordered their famous Mac and cheese, and I ordered their \"ultimate experience\" pork belly. I'm not kidding when I say that this was the best food I have ever eaten in my entire life. The pork belly just melted in my mouth and the purees were wonderful.   I had the best dining experience in my life and I will not forget it. A must-try if you live in Montreal!"}
{"text":"We highly recommend pork belly and Mac & Cheese. If you are a party of two, you have much better chance of being seated early.  My wife and I have two kids.  We had to be in line for more than two hours.  Most of their tables are for two and can be easily put next to each other to seat four.  However, the restaurant would not do so, possibly because they can make more money with adult, ordering drinks!"}
{"text":"Servers were great and food was awesome!!!! We ordered duck as an appetizer and pork belly as a main and creme brulee as a dessert and shared. I've got goosebumps at the first bite of pork belly!! Soooooooo delicious x)) I definitely wanna go back to this restaurant and try their mac and cheese someday!!!!"}
{"text":"This family run restaurant is intimate, romantic, and beautiful. The food is a cross between comfort food and trendy buzz food. We had a three course meal.  Each course was a new symphony of flavors. The fresh ingredients and skillful preparation were a winning combo. Five stars is hardly enough."}
{"text":"In a word....WOW! Come here hungry. Everything was really delicious. Everything was fresh and new. Service was amazing. Ambiance was lovely. Wish I had room for some pictures on my phone. I will make a visit here again for sure.  We had the soup, foie gras, pork belly and Cornish hen for two."}
{"text":"Was this place worth the two hour wait? Yes.   I think the truffle mac and cheese and the pork belly were one of the best dishes I've had. The taste of truffles compliments unnaturally well with the satisfaction of the cheesy macronis. The pork belly was a heavenly balance of juicy meat and crispy skin.  The icelandic cod and burrata cheese pizza dim in comparison to the above two dishes.   The service was okay and nothing out of the ordinary. They have a limited beer selection and no spirits or cocktails."}
{"text":"We had the soup, pizza, pork belly and maple cake. The food was good But we were expecting for better after the waiting and those 5 star reviews. the staff is super friendly tho."}
{"text":"This was by far the best food I had while visiting Montreal. It was worth every minute of the wait, which was a line outside and down the block. Be sure to get the truffle mac and cheese with the Christmas ham and the Pork belly! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic. The explosion of flavors in the mac and cheese was to die for. Also had there soup of the day which was a buttermilk squash which was probably the best soup I have ever had. I was ready to lick the bowl clean. Great place."}
{"text":"On a cold and hungry night during our trip in Montreal, my group and I were Yelping around for a delicious meal. We had no idea what we were in the mood for but thankfully came across Le Robin Square. After scrolling around through pictures of people's dishes, we were ready to be on our way in no time!   When we got to the restaurant, we were one of the few people in line but there was still an approx. 20-30 min wait. A sweet woman came to greet us and offered us a small cup of tea along with the menu to look at. She explained that the restaurant is entirely family owned! The mother makes the recipes, brother is the chef, etc.!   By the time we were seated, we already knew what we wanted. We ordered the French onion soup, pork belly dish, bread pudding, and their special mac & cheese! MY GOODNESS it was the most delicious meals of our entire trip- and undoubtedly the BEST mac and cheese dish we've ever had in our lives so far. Yeah I know- when I first thought of \"mac and cheese,\" I too imagined the typical microwavable frozen packs you buy at the market. Trust me- it is the furthest you can go from that. I'm sorry- I simply cannot describe how it tasted. If you're in the Montreal area, you just have to go and try it for yourself.   Okay clearly the Mac & cheese was the highlight of my meal. But let's not forgot the French onion soup we first had. Delicious delicious delicious. Best French onion I can possibly dream of.  The bread pudding was served warm, moist, and just the right amount of sweet!   Service was off the roof. A friendly, warm, and conversational family! All super attentive and prideful of the reputation they've built. Beautiful decor and very lively environment.   No doubt in mind we will eat here again when we go back to Montreal."}
{"text":"A la recherche d'un endroit \"pas touristique\" pour déjeuner dans le quartier, nous avons beaucoup tourné avant de nous résigner à rentrer dans le Robin Square, le \"seul truc\" qui nous paraissait potable... Et quelle belle surprise!  On a pu découvrir un petit resto familial où tout est fait maison: la maman et le fils aux fourneaux, la fille au service. Nous étions 4 à avoir pris des plats différents et tout était EXCELLENT: de la sélection de bière en passant par la soupe, la salade César ultra gourmande, les sandwiches avec pain maison, les pâtes, le cheesecake... Un sans faute, et qui plus est avec un accueil très chaleureux. Une chose est sûre, si on revient dans le coin, on ira manger au Robin Square !"}
{"text":"On my first visit to Montreal, I went to Le Robin Square, mostly based on their #1 rating on Yelp.  My family of five order the Mac and cheese, the ultimate experience, calamari and the steak.  The calamari and the steak were ok. The Mac and cheese was absolutely delicious.  It's served with a homemade hot sauce on the side that had a nice habanero kick. My kids could not stop eating the Mac. The ultimate experience was out of this world. It was the best dish I've ever eaten, period. The pork belly just melts in your mouth. It's served on three delectable purees and sautéed mushrooms. If you ever get a chance to dine here do not leave until you've tried the ultimate experience!"}
{"text":"My husband and I took our two year old here our first night in Montreal. We were seated upstairs in a small loft area. No high chairs, so beware! The restaurant locally sources their foods and is a family run business, so the menu is one page. We had the mac and cheese and the pork belly along with the local stout. We also had the pistachio creme brulee and the chocolate cake. Everything was delicious! Our picky son ate the some cheese and bread. The service was A+ though. Everyone was really understanding about our tired kid!"}
{"text":"Le Square Robin is a fantastic find.  If you are a foodie who wants local food, done fresh each day, to showcase the best tastes, visit Le Square Robin.  This family run business makes patrons feel both comfortable and appreciated.  The staff is very friendly.  It is a lively atmosphere with fairly loud background music that has a bass beat.  Save your quiet conversation for another time, and enjoy the goat cheese tart, butternut squash soup, and beef skirt with killer mashed potatoes.  I am sure that everything on the menu is equally rich and delicious."}
{"text":"The pork belly will make your heart sing and in years to come you will remember your first bite as one of the most blissful moments of your life. The food is pure joy - do not miss your chance of experiencing the love and passion of this warm and welcoming family business."}
{"text":"Le Robin Square was the best restaurant I tried while visiting Montreal last month. Every single item of food that was brought to our table was delicious. I was worried because they didn't seem to have a ton of vegetarian options, but they let us get the mac and cheese with the pork on the side. I also split a beet salad and the burrata flat bread. The flat bread was really good and the salad was one of the best beer salads I've ever had. This visit started my new food obsession with burrata and I'll be Forever grateful to Le Robin Square for introducing me to this wonderful cheese.   The restaurant is apparently family owned and it seemed like everyone working there was in a good mood. Our was very friendly (even after we spilt water all over the table) and great at her job. They also had a solid bottled beer selection."}
{"text":"Our server Rachael was extraordinary. She was attentive knowledgeable and pleasant. The food from the kitchen was superb. All 6 of us throughly enjoyed the chefs dishes from the beef to the pork. The chef happens to be her brother and he's young but quite talented with a mature pallet.  Thank you Rachael for serving my quests and I a wonderful meal from your brothers kitchen."}
{"text":"Thanks yelp for finding such a great place for lunch! Very cute interior with super friendly staff. The food took a little while but it was totally worth the wait! The Mac n Cheese is life changing, and it was a ton of food!"}
{"text":"Food- Me and my girlfriend had the porkbelly and mac and cheese. It was one of the two best dishes I ever had in my life.  Restaurant- Really small inside but modern looking.  Service- The service was excellent and was very attentive.  Value- Really good for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"The mac and cheese will change your life. The servers are all so nice and happy and accommodating. It's awesome to see a family run business that's thriving and people who love what they do. Well worth a stop, wonderfully located in downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. I don't think I have experienced such attentive and genuine service at a restaurant. Very Personable staff and the food was fantastic. Great evening out and very accommodating for kids."}
{"text":"Holy moly this place deserves 100 STARS. It's beyond amazing. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about this place because wow. I was so satisfied after eating here.   The week we went, the menu featured all their best sellers, so of course we ordered their \" Incredible Mac & Cheese\". I also wanted to order \"The Ultimate Experience\" (the pork belly), but our waitress warned us how big the portions would be which I was thankful for because the Mac & Cheese was certainly enough for two.   But if you're hungry, the mac & cheese is so worth it. I'd imagine that the pork belly is amazing as well, so if there's a few of you, I'd definitely order that as well if I was you.   We were some of the first people who went in for dinner service & by the time we finished, there was a line so definitely try to come early. If you can't, I'm telling you, this place is worth the wait.   If you are visiting Montreal, make this restaurant one of your stops. You will not regret it & it will be the best thing you have in this city."}
{"text":"Ah, one of the best Mac and Cheese!   The restaurant is very small and they don't take reservation. So if you want to try the restaurant, better make sure to go there early, or make you're patient that day!  It cost above average, but not too expensive... Worth a try!"}
{"text":"Saw all these great reviews and decided to see what the fuss was all about. To begin with this establishment is family owned and open only 4 days a week. They also have a seasonal menu apart from their favorites (mac n cheese and pizza) that don't fall off the menu. I started with the Pizza which had fresh dough and a blob of burrata cheese. It was fresh and not very heavy. We then went on to try the Mac and Cheese with Ham and the Beef Stew. I would rate the Beef Stew above the Mac and Cheese simply because of the flavor. The stew was delicious and the potatoes with the Brussels Sprouts clearly edged out the Mac & Cheese for me. Overall good food with pleasant staff makes this place a favorite among locals and tourists."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the best meal of my mini break in Montreal here on Saturday.  Thank you to the reviewers who recommended getting here 10-15 mins prior to opening.  We were first in line on Saturday for a table we had to wait an extra 30 mins as they opened at 6:30pm.  For starters we had a smoked jalapeño soup that was 10/10.  The soup was creamy and nicely seasoned with onion and a smoky hint of jalapeño.  We appreciated that the soup was served at the correct temperature. Our mains of pork belly and mac&cheese were equally as impressive. The pork belly was melt in your mouth tender and the portion size very generous.  Our server explained to us that the mac&cheese was different than the norm and she was right their take on mac & cheese is different in a good way, the sauce is cream based with a slight hint of cheese and heaps of a sweetish tasting ham loaded on top. Service was fantastic, it's a family run restaurant and they are extremely friendly and accommodating.  Prices are reasonable and well worth the quality of food and service provided."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal food, we did the Mac and cheese and the pork belly. There was a very long wait as this is a small place but it was undoubtedly worth it."}
{"text":"This is a cute place, looks like it's family run.  The beef loin was good, really enjoyed the pea puree.  I didn't like the polenta as much, I think I would've preferred a fluffy garlic mash.  The truffle mac and cheese was really good.  I think I'm a fan of truffle oil now.  Overall, I would recommend.  Friendly service, good location, fairly reasonable pricing doesn't hurt."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. I had the incredible mac and cheese (without the ham) with the homemade hot sauce.  It was absolutely delicious. The flavors exploded in my mouth - probably the best mac and cheese I ever had. As for the hot sauce, I wanted to buy a bottle and take it home. I wanted to try more dishes and order more food but I was stuffed.   The restaurant is family owned and everyone is super friendly. I dined alone and didn't feel out of place. Every waiter served me. Withevery sip of water someone was there to replenish my glass. (NOT in an annoying way but in an attentive we are here to serve you way).    I got to the restaurant at about 5pm on a Friday night and was seated immediately. However, by 5:30pm there was a line outside and every table was filled. The restaurant is small but perfect."}
{"text":"My fiance and I ate here on our trip to Montreal last week and had a reallly great meal. It's a small place, so it's easy to miss, but I am so glad that we didn't! The restaurant is a family owned place and the hostess/owner took such pride in telling us about how they all work together to craft the menu and bring it to life. The food was delicious. We had the beet salad with their homemade cheese, candied walnuts and sprouts. For our dinner, I had the Black Truffle Rigatoni with fresh cream and house made bacon and my fiance had their mac and cheese with ham. Both were so, so delicious. We left too full for dessert and I wish we would have been able to go there again before we left Montreal. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on sunday...fantastic food and fantastic family service!  The classic sandwich is a must!"}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal for a week and this is BY FAR the best food we've had here. We ordered all 3 of the main entrees and shared them and they surpassed my expectations. The staff was extremely helpful and informative about the menu and history of the restaurant. THIS IS A MUST GO TO if you want delicious food. Also it's a small place so try and make sure you go early to get a spot!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on New Years' Eve. The restaurant might looked closed at first, but that's simply because of the dim lighting. The waiters were attentive and very friendly. They took their time to explain their most popular dishes (the Mac & Cheese and the Ultimate experience). Overall, the ambiance was pleasant and welcoming.  For two people with a small appetite, sharing the soup of the day and the mac & cheese was more than enough. The soup of the day was an onion and cherry tomato soup; it had a kick to it which was perfect to warm us up from the cold that had numbed our faces while we were waiting outside. The homemade bread was nice and spongy, but it would have been nice if it were toasted instead. The mac & cheese has a very distinct flavour to it that is incomparable. It wasn't my cup of tea since the sweetness of it got overwhelming very quickly. The cheese cracker that was used as a topping made it taste much better; perhaps, maybe something that is saltier than the ham would've been better to compliment that sweetness. Regardless, it's something that you can't get anywhere else and that is worth trying at least once.   Will definitely come back to try the other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Omg..... the pork belly is the best I've ever had.. ever.. ever.. ever. Place is small and very cute.  Staff,  owner and chef are all fantastic people that know what they are doing."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! I love Montreal and their boutique restaurants! We visited as a Sunday morning cure after Halloween! The music was pumping and lively! The waitress greeted us and explained the family restaurant that everything was homemade even the bread! There is only a handful of things to order, but we visited for a late breakfast. Had the egg and pulled pork sandwich. Shortly after ordering they brought us a nicely plated mini muffin and skewer of fresh grapes and orange. Our sandwich came out shortly after (very attentive service by the staff) the sandwich was huge! Very fresh ingredients! Meat was spiced very well and the eggs was cooked perfectly. It was satisfying and half was good for one person!  I wish I could find a place like this locally! What a great experience before heading back home! 10/10 must visit! Limited seating! But worth it! A must visit for their very filling meal and excellent service :)"}
{"text":"Ate a Le Robin Square with my husband on a Tuesday night. We made a reservation, but the restaurant was not packed when we got there. Our waitress gave us a great introduction to the restaurants and gave us some excellent recommendations. My husband and I got the calamari, the Mac and cheese with pork cooked in duck fat, the ultimate experiment which is another pork dish, and two side. For our two sides we got roasted veggies and the foie gras.   The calamari is not fried like normal calamari I am used to. It is served with some veggies on top of a cauliflower mash. It was very good. The Mac and cheese comes with a huge piece of pork sitting in the center. The Mac and cheese alone is delicious because it is cooked in truffle the oil. The pork is super juicy and tender. The dish is HUGE and a good value. The ultimate experiment is good, but not as good as the Mac and cheese. The ultimate experiment is served with an apricot jam and a maple syrup sauce. The pork is very crispy on the top and becomes more tender as you eat through the layers. The sides we ordered were also very good. The roasted veggies comes with broccoli, beets and Brussel sprouts. The vegetables are so good and aren't drenched in garlic or sauces. The natural flavors of the vegetables are great by itself. The foie gras was extremely rich and decadent. I took a small bite and it was too much for me already. It was like eating butter and it just melts in your mouth. It was served with an orange jam.   The service at Le Robin Square is excellent. The restaurant is very clean and has great music. By the end of our new the restaurant definitely filled up. We had an extraordinary time at Le Robin Square and would definitely recommend people give it a shot. The price is not that bad either for the amount of food and service you get."}
{"text":"What can I say, Le Robin Square deserves all five stars for their services, quality of their foods, and the friendly atmosphere! Their pork belly was exquisite, and the Beef Poutine was out of this world! I will make my way back here again when I am back in Montreal in the future!!! Thank you Le Robin!"}
{"text":"Best meal of the trip! The food was fantastic! I had the Mac and Cheese (their most popular item). It was amazing. The Mac and Cheese alone without the pork it comes with was great. The pork which had a slightly sweet taste was great too. Combined, it was something else. Also Sylvia, our waitress, was a delight and informed us about the best places to check out in Montreal. I can't recommend this place enough! :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I have no words to describe the pork belly and Mac and cheese. Simply delicious."}
{"text":"We were skeptical about all the good reviews and actually tried to go to another restaurant before hitting on this one. (The other restaurant was full and wouldn't let us wait for a table.) So glad we came here!! They were SO nice! All of the staff was pleasant and acknowledged/talked to you - not just if you were \"their table.\"  It's a small restaurant with a little upstairs.  We sat upstairs and it was cozy.  Has a sort of upscale diner feel.  We split the burrata pizza and the mac and cheese and some sort of bread pudding dessert. Can't remember what it was called but it's made with maple syrup.  Burrata Pizza: so yummy. Lots of cheese on it and perfect size for an appetizer for 2 people  Mac and Cheese: SO YUMMY!  The meat is a little sweet but they give you hot sauce to go with the dish and it really brings all the flavors together well.  Thought the description on the menu didn't do this dish justice because it says something about the mac and cheese being topped with ham but it's really more like a brined pulled pork that has some nice maple glazing on it.  Not like Christmas ham slices or something.  We probably wouldn't have ordered this if we hadn't gotten a more accurate description from other people's reviews.    Dessert: heavenly  That's it.  A solid restaurant with a cute atmosphere, nice and attentive service and really good food.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This is a family run resto with a relaxed feel. The service is by family members which means that it is spot on and you get the attention you expect. The menu is small but what they do is very, very good! We expected way less when we walked in but our expectations were exceeded in all departments. The quality was fantastic. The portion sizes really surprised me - they were very generous. Double thumbs up! The only drawback is the pricing which we found was a little higher than expected."}
{"text":"The best food any of us has ever had!  Lick your plates good!!!   We had read the other reviews and I really wanted to try it out.  Took a little arm twisting to convince my family, but was so worth it!   From the start- we tried some local beers which were delicious.  The homemade breads made by the family owned restaurant's matriarch were delicious!    My daughter and I split the rigatoni and were fighting over the scraps and sauce drippings by the end of the meal.    My husband had the ultimate experience.  It truly was the ultimate experience!!! He drooled over every bite but did share little bits with each of us including our 15yr old son pickiest child on earth who just planned on eating bread and ended up asking for more of dad's food- truly a first as he seems allergic to real food!     We topped it off sharing a few desserts- the seasonal poor man's pudding: a concoction of vanilla white cake and maple syrup that had been made into a bubbly maple cream topped with a bit of chocolate and then an apple cinnamon-y cheesecake: tart and sweet at the same time... We did not leave any crumbs of food and rolled out of the restaurant talking about all the food and wanting more even though we were ready to burst.      The waitress was bilingual, extremely helpful and sweet and the price was refreshingly reasonable for all the incredible food we had.  We would consider driving back and revisiting Montreal just to eat here again!"}
{"text":"The food and experience was as advertised. It is a family run restaurant with a fun and courteous atmosphere. This was our best meal in Montreal. My wife picked and particularly enjoyed the vegetarian option. Her polenta was wonderful and the pickled egg was interesting. The espresso martini was smooth and delicious. The barbecue ribs was a large slab and falling off the bone delicious. Being from North Carolina and the south I know my barbecue and they hit the mark :-)"}
{"text":"Best Homecooked and Fine dining restaurant I have ever had in my life. It is a must eat in Montreal. Honestly it's perfect for an extremely out of this world experience. We came up from Boston and New York, and is honestly better than some of the top notch restaurants there.  Montreal for the Win!!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of the most thought out and memorable meal I have ever had.   I had the nagono pork belly which was brined, smoked and braised, with a truffle celery-root purée, pear and apricot jam, with shallot and maple sauce. My entree was the perfect portion and did not leave me feeling bloated afterward.   They don't take reservations, so your best bet is to arrive before they open and wait on line. They also don't make substitutions since each dish is crafted to have flavor combinations and textures that compliment each other."}
{"text":"Ranks among my top ten as a phenomenal 'gastro' (to use a much abused term) experiences having dinner in restaurants on vacation. Why you ask? Despite the other tempting caveats like 'locally sourced, seasonal, farm to table' the Robin family brings it to your table because they know only ONE way to do it: avec amour!  If the food, exuberant staff and pleasant vibe doesn't win you over you're not in the right place for dinner. Set in a touristy downtown Montreal neighborhood with minimal parking and busy traffic, you might pass the restaurant without even knowing you did. We found Robin Square via yelp, yep, you guessed right. Despite the eclectic interior and slightly cramped seating upstairs our dining experience was excellent! The staff was on point with every nuance. Also nice to find the chef's sister waiting tables and enthusiastically responding to our inquiries regarding their business.  Great things are ahead for Robin Square, especially if they expand and perhaps attract the Quebecois who may be reticent to venture near the inundated 'Anglais' downtown...if only they knew about the pride and passion that was going into the food just a few blocks away from their usual haunts! Je me souviens!"}
{"text":"So close. So close. I wanted to give them 4 stars. But it wasn't their fault for the long wait (1 1/2 hours). I blame you mother***** who couldn't wait to go home and write the fudging reviews. CMON! Food was legendary. Service was fantastic. What I ordered? Everything."}
{"text":"Le Robin Square will be one of my top places to go back to eat in Montreal. Family oriented and the menu is simple to perfection. We ordered the Ultimate Experience that is prep 5 days in advance was amazing. The slow cook of the Porto belly is out of this world and extremely flavorful. All the combination on the dish complimented each other. We also order the Incredible Mac&Cheese and it was hands down the best Mac&Cheese I have ever had. It was out of this world. Must try and taste for yourself."}
{"text":"This was the best meal I've had in recent memory. The staff was so friendly and when we arrived, there was a line out front. I ended up getting a table as a walk in but I recommend that you make a reservation beforehand. The pork belly melted in your mouth and the Mac and Cheese w truffle oil was unreal. I highly recommend and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"What a find! I was visiting from Boston and looking for a quaint place for a great meal before I left the city. WOW.   Small menu and not much variety - but this place is all quality vs. quantity. Think rich, flavorful and DELICIOUS. I had read other reviews before selecting Le Robin Square so I had an idea of what I wanted. I had a hard time choosing - so I got 2 different entrees. I ordered the Mac n Cheese with truffle oil and ham and I got the Pork Belly. Both are substantial and I brought some leftovers back with me. If you can take a friend or two and share plates, you win big.   Small wine list too but good selection and variety of simple red and whites. Service was super friendly and good. So genuine. You could put this food in an upscale setting with fancy settings and staff and pull it off. That's what's so great about this place - no pretense, lots of flavor and a pleasant atmosphere to soak it all in - one bite at a time."}
{"text":"Short version: amazing meal experience and unbelievably great staff!  Long version: first visit to Montreal. Found this gem on Yelp and decided to give it a go.  Richly rewarding! The food quality, presentation, and the personal attention given by the staff made this night complete.   The goat cheese tart with greens was brilliant.  The mac and cheese featured a delicious twist. If you can take the heat, pair it with the hottest hot sauce they offer. You won't regret it. Guinea fowl with gnocchi is brilliant. The dish was cooked perfectly and paired with two sauces that compliment the flavor.  Dessert was beautiful, sublime, and such fun.  A note about the staff: it is evident that they truly love to share their appreciation of food and genuine warmth with all who visit.  The pride they take in this intimate but very inviting place is remarkable.  The atmosphere is intimate as stated, but also promotes conversation with other guests which can be great fun.  Can't recommend this place enough!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My teenager and I were getting near the end of our mutual patience when we queued here. Food and ambiance contributed to quick turnaround of moods. We shared the Ultimate Experience and the mac and cheese. Both exquisite although we both preferred the pork belly in the end. Wonderful family restaurant- wait wasn't too long and they were very attentive to keep the queue moving. Definitely would go back next time in Montreal."}
{"text":"They are pairing breads with dishes and combining ingredients and preparation to make a meal that is truly divine.   Small and easy for the owner to talk to you, they are friendly and truly and excellent place to dine near old Montreal.  Pork Belly and mac and cheese are their stars but everything was good."}
{"text":"So the pork belly was amazing! It's a neat family run restaurant, so the waitresses look the same lol. I also had the chilly there but would not refund it."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding and the service was even better. I love that it is a family owned business, with the brother in the kitchen and the sister running the front of the house with her warm hospitality.  Burrata Pizza was perfection, and the mac & cheese was deliciously unique with truffle oil and shredded meat."}
{"text":"Food was very good with nice sized portions. The place is a bit small but the wait is worth it. I would definitely recommend and hope to visit again while in Montreal"}
{"text":"This place is very small and the wait for us was 30 minutes or second seating for the evening.  We had the salad, soup, burrata pizza, pork belly entree, beer and  and dessert so we tried everything to get a good sampling for the three of us.  The menu is limited but what they do do, they do it very well.  The line to wait is harsh since parking down there is about $3.75 per hour and difficult to estimate how long you have to wait and then eat.  The pricing was acceptable for the rating considering this area is a tourist trap and other highly rated restaurants were quite a bit more for French canadian food.  We were so sick of poutine that we really enjoyed this meal.  I'd give it a try but just be prepared to wait in a small area to eat in a small restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, probably my favorite in Montreal! It's a cute family owned restaurant with a friendly staff and phenomenal food. We had to wait a little bit for a table, but our waitress came and took our order as we were waiting so when we were seated, we didn't need to wait long for our food. My mom and I split the beef shoulder and the mac and cheese. The beef shoulder was perfectly tender and came with an amazingly creamy polenta. The mac and cheese was the real star for me though. It was topped with truffle salt and came with a hot sauce, it was so good. I'll probably never be able to eat mac and cheese again without comparing it to the one I ate here. The combination of awesome staff and amazing food makes this place a must go, you will be glad that you did!"}
{"text":"Come here, and do it now.  This place is arguably one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal.  It was so good, my girlfriend and I went two nights in a row.  Yeah, it's that good.  Let's begin.  The wait can be long, but be patient, it's worth it.  They have a nice microbrew beer selection as well as a wine list.  The food, is incredible.  An ever changing simple and small menu, everything we tried was delicious.  Their house favorites happened to be my favorites as well, their mac 'n cheese, pork belly, steak, and calamari.  I would be writing a novel describing the intracacies of each dish, so I won't.  You really just need to try it for yourself, you won't regret a single thing.  Oh and don't forget dessert, order the pouding chomeur.  Change your life.  The service may seem hectic, but they are seamless, efficient and hospitable.  Sylvia, is super friendly and bubbly, and makes you feel right at home.  Needless to say, I will be returning, and bringing everyone and anyone that will want to have a truly great dining experience."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best meals ever.  The hot sauce, the steak, the mac n cheese, polenta, celery soup, etc etc etc.   wow. Great people and great food."}
{"text":"Short menu selection, long wait and tight space..  and these things make all the sense in the world once you're inside. Opened 2 years ago, Family owned, locally sourced, all the attention to detail you could imagine, delicious eats, and such a natural, warm service.  - Waited around 30-40 mins (played pokemon go nearby and had great company so no biggie), the owner also came outside and showed us the food and drink menu, explained the concept, and gave us an estimate of waiting time. - Tried the first four things on the menu:    / Cream of Onion Soup w/Smoked Jalapeño   / Pizza with Fresh Burrata (Best cheese of my lifeeee)   / Caesar Salad   / Mac & Cheese w/ Pork Belly we were only 2 people so this was ambitious, but were sooo happy to eat the leftovers the next day.  Extremely happy to have found this gem during our vacation, Wish them the best and Merci for these incredible eats!!"}
{"text":"I knew when I saw the reviews here, I just had to stop in!  The restaurant itself is tiny, I'd try to come here before, or after the dinner rush so you don't have to wait too long.  We ended up waiting about 20 minutes before we got sat.    There is not a full bar here, just beer and wine.   My bf and I decided to split the mac and cheese, and the pizza (which has no meat.)  The mac and cheese was a home run and was the perfect combo of sweet and spicy.  The \"ham\" that comes on top of it is more like shredded pork.  We ordered their home made tobasco sauce to add to it for an additional spice, which I highly recommend doing.  The pizza was just okay, very underwhelmed.  It was really bland and similar to a bruchetta type pizza and came with a huge dallop of cheese on it.  Pass on this dish.  Dessert we shared a tiny mason jar \"cheesecake\" with a apricot type of sauce.  This didn't really had the texture of cheesecake, but still had a good flavor.  I think it would be better would some type of crust layer at the bottom.  We also shared their maple cake which was really yummy and had a strong maple flavor.  It would have been good with some vanilla ice cream.  Service was quick, attentive, and friendly.  If you decide to come here don't leave without trying the winner of the night, the mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"I visit Montreal a couple of times each year for business and I want to make my meals count. After reading all the rave reviews I've been meaning to try Le Robin Square since last year, but finally got my chance last night.  First of all, I'm not sure whether it's due to the weather or perhaps my dinnertime is earlier than most residents, but the restaurant was mostly empty on this Wednesday night at 6:30PM. I was immediately greeted and seated.  Looking at the menu, I was tempted to let everything but knew I no longer had the age nor  the stomach to over indulge as I loved to do. Eventually I picked the Cream of Cauliflower soup, the Mac and Cheese, and the baked bread/cake pudding, along with a bottle of locally brewed beer.  The food was excellent. I've always had a fondness for cream-based soups and bisques, and it didn't disappoint. The flavor was savory with a bit of kick as they added a bit of homemade Tabasco sauce to it.  The mac and cheese was wonderful, with mounds of pulled pork/spiced ham on top and plenty of the earthy flavor from the truffle oil. Occasionally I'll get a bit of crunch from the sea salt that cut through the richness of the dish. I couldn't finish it but made sure I had it packed for the next day's lunch.  I also decided to get dessert despite being unable to finish my entree, and I'm glad I did! The bread/cake pudding was just sweet enough from the maple syrup and came with a bit of creme fresh which I could douse on my own. I used it all up, of course. It was a perfect ending to a great meal.  The service was excellent throughout. Everyone made sure that I was taken care of and happy every step of the way, and the waitress (who wasn't responsible for me) poured my beer for me whenever she noticed my glass getting low. I could not have asked for more.  Anyone who enjoys meticulously made good with excellent service couldn't do better than Le Robin Square in Montreal, IMO."}
{"text":"I have never been a big fan of pork belly, but everyone said I had to try it. So we got it. It was amazing! It was perfectly cooked and seasoned. That part was good. We also ordered their Mac and Cheese, which, don't get me wrong, is not like regular Mac and cheese. It has bacon and a good sauce. Would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet - Robin Square is a must. You can tell the family staff cares about their restaurant and wants you to have an enjoyable experience. Small menu makes it easier to pick and ensures fresher ingredients. Tried the salmon, and Mac and cheese dishes. Both excellent, but there's a reason the Mac and Cheese stays on the menu all the time. Don't leave the place without at least trying it.   Bon Apetit!"}
{"text":"To say this place is 5 star still doesn't do it justice. AMAZING dinner! Pork belly & Mac and cheese, on point! Farm-to-table, family owned and is 100% a must-have if you're in Montreal! Absolutely phenomenal!"}
{"text":"It's not every day I give a establishment a 5/5. In fact it's never happened. Robin Square has set a new benchmark for the perfect restaurant. From the get go you see big smiles and happy faces both in the staff welcoming you and the patrons sitting at their tables. A family owned establishment promoting local produce and market. The menu is short but covers all the essentials (veg, meat and fish). Staff were attentive but not overly American style.  We ordered the soup to share, chicken Caesar salad and Beef shoulder as well as two local beers. What can I say? The soup was fantastic. I'm not big on soup but it was tasty and came with fresh bread. The chicken Caesar was HUGE. Enough for three people. Amazing taste and not over the top on sauce. And here we are to the most Amazing meal I have ever had. The Beef shoulder was cooked perfectly. It sat on a cheese polenta which was to die for.  I recommended this place 5 stars"}
{"text":"It is a small family owned restaurant. Yes there is an average 35-40 mins wait to get in the door even for a party of 3 and they don't take reservations. I would not suggest this place if you are coming with a large group. Spacing and tables are small but they did say that they are working on a new location.  Our waitress and hostess were great, they were attentive and courteous the entire time. Unfortunately I cannot say the same thing for the food. Coming to this restaurant I was expecting to see french dishes on the menu. Most items were some sort version of American food. I ordered Mac and Cheese which I think it should not be called Mac and Cheese if there is no cheese in it, they used cream instead with lots coarse salt, bread crumbs and shredded beef on top which tasted terrible. In my opinion, If you are going to change the recipe for a classic dish such as this one, you need to go above and beyond with it. Pork Belly was done well but it came with 2 sauces covering the entire plate, and literally mixing with each other. Less sauce on the plate please. And Salmon was plain old salmon, nothing special.   Overall I was very disappointed with the food. I would highly recommend changing your menu."}
{"text":"Le Robin Square's food was very delicious and made me happy on several levels. What I enjoyed the most was the friendly staff. Best service we received our entire time in Montreal.  We got the mac and cheese and pizza, both were fabulous. The flavors were amazing, it's as if the ingredients were making sweet, sweet love to each other to make for an out of this world experience."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I'm speechless. This place is amazing! If you come here try the pork belly. It is something unbelievable. In addition to that the service is incredible, the owners run the place and you can see the passion and love they put into it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! A small but very intimate environment. We came here visiting from Texas and were a bit worried about the portion sizes but left very satisfied. The pork belly from the ultimate experience was great! The beef skirt seems to not be reviewed as much but oh man, it was great! Very impressed and definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The Mac & Cheese was the BEST FUCKING MAC & CHEESE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY WHOLE FUCKING LIFE.   The place was small but super cozy. Great for parties of 2-3. All servers made a point to greet and welcome us. The head chef personally came to our table to offer us tastes of wine.   The wait was 2 hours long (starting around 7:30pm on Saturday night) but I highly recommend stopping here if you have the time and $$... there are 3 poke stops nearby to keep you occupied if you have a lure. 5/5 would come eat here again."}
{"text":"No words, pure feelings. Divine mac and cheese and pork belly and cake and IPA. I am speechless."}
{"text":"LOVED this place.  Embraced dairy on this trip (usually vegan) because I know it's just not that easy to get animal free protein in Montreal (or so I thought!  More on this in other reviews) ... ANYWAY ... this family run place is AWESOME ... just go, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Most outstanding mac and cheese dish and wonderful pork belly. Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviews, I can't say enough good things about Le Robin Square. From the kind way we were greeted and given a brief history of the restaurant, to delicious plate after plate, everything was perfect. The Mac and cheese, which I was worried would be heavy, was somehow light and one of the best pasta dishes I can recall. We then split the Guinea fowl and the pork belly, both of which were phenomenal. The pork belly was like taking all of the good parts of eating a spare rib into one dish. This restaurant is worth waiting for (although we luckily got a table right away at about 7!). The waitress and hostess were also very helpful in picking beers and checking in to make sure everything was great. Keep it up! I'll be sure to be back next time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"I will forever define my dining life as \"before\" and \"after\" my experience here. The Mac n Cheese and the Pork Belly are both among the top 10 meals of my life. Non stop umami!  On top of it all, service is great, beers are refreshing. The wait was WELL worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and great food. Try the mac and cheese and the ultimate experience!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Montréal. I searched on yelp and found this place. Went in and loved the place already. We ordered the Mac and cheese with brisket and pork belly dish. They both were amazing. When I had the pork belly skin, it was crispy and then it just exploded in my mouth. It was full of flavors. We loved both dishes. The desserts were good too. This place didn't disappoint us."}
{"text":"What a sensational place!  We arrived around 8:30pm on a Thursday night and miraculously there was no line.  There is a sign on the door asking you to wait at said door and someone would come out to see you.  After a couple of minutes a lovely girl came out to greet us; she went on to describe what the restaurant was.  It's a family business; her brother is the chef, her mom makes the bread and desserts and her cousins are the servers.  She was so enthusiastic and made us feel so welcomed and excited to be there.  It was hot that day and she offered us drinks while we were waiting; she also took our orders so that by the time we sat we wouldn't have to wait long for our food to be served; ingenious.  I wish all places did that.  She also mentioned that normally there is a line down the block, so we were lucky that night since there was no line. Looking at the menu we wanted it all, but decided on the mac & cheese and the pork belly.  The mac and cheese served with shredded Christmas ham.  It was unbelievable; super creamy and the ham on top was like nothing i have had before.  It was marvelous.  The pork belly we were told takes days to make and was stupendous.  It was served with a creamy celery root puree and an apple puree and a sauce.  It was all so delicious. The dishes sound super heavy and rich, but honestly they were so well balanced they didn't feel like that at all.  We were told to save room for dessert and we did.  Our server recommended a typical dessert of Quebec called pudding chomeur.  It's a yellow cake with maple syrup baked in and was served warm, broken up in pieces with some syrup drizzled over top and a piece of chocolate.  It was amazing, bite after bite we couldn't believe how good it was.  LRS is so impressive and delicious, that it's almost hard to describe until you experience it yourself."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Great atmosphere - completely family run.  Mom runs the kitchen at lunch and the brother runs the dinner service.  Cute and little - walking distance from the cobblestones of old Montreal.  It is a very tight and simple menu, but you pretty much can't go wrong with anything  on it.  We stopped by for lunch on a thursday at noon and although it was pretty empty when we got there - it filled up quickly!  Highly recommend checking it out - whether for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"There isn't a lot to be said that all of the others haven't mentioned. This place is fantastic, great food and great vibe. We had the Mac and cheese and their new plate of a beef brisket risotto. Oh.my.god. they were amazing. The pork on the Mac and cheese is sweet and tastes just like Christmas.   I cannot underscore enough: IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WAIT 1+ HOURS, GET THERE BEFORE THEY OPEN. The night we went they opened at 6 and we got there around 6:20 and had to wait about an hour. It's worth it, but be ready."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Montreal is Le Robin Square. Using their surname for the restaurant name, the the Robins make wonderful food and are incredibly warm and welcoming. I have tried the sous vide beef, the pork belly and the mac & cheese. All of them are worth recommending and arguably worth going out of your way to track down. Their website shows that they have completed a move that they were planning the last time i visited (November 2017). I look forward to checking out their new digs and confirming that the space to spread their wings has made them even better. The menu works to be particularly Quebecois from the beer selection to the desert offerings, featuring lots of local ingredients all used to highlight their best qualities. They have a local dessert made of white cake and maple syrup that does not sound appealing but is super tasty. Take your time and try everything you can because it is all worth it."}
{"text":"Went there with my boyfriend a couple weeks ago and it made me really disappointed. We read a lot reviews on yelp, so we went there with a very high expectation. However, the food was just average.   My boyfriend had the mac and cheese, which was not as good as the comments are saying.  I had the pork belly. It tasted great on the beginning, but after a couple of bites, it started to cloy.   We also tried the soup, it was a very normal soup which you can have anywhere."}
{"text":"This place is a must, a well deserved 5 stars. I believe it is family owned and ran. You may start with one waiter but will be served by another. Soon you will find out they all help each other, which makes the service more efficient. The place itself is a bit small, I found that going with a smaller group like 2 people will get you a sit faster than 4. That's just how good it is, but it's worth the wait if you have a group. I notice their service was amazing, even though there was a bigger group that was waiting longer than a 2 seater, they served them all bread while they continued to wait. The bread is amazing too, soft and chewy with a flaky crust.   On to the dishes. We ordered the soup of the day which was onion and jalapeño, boy it was amazing. I was a bit concerned how creamy it looked but it was nothing but tasteful flavors. It was not heavy at all and you got a nice hint of spicy.  I heard the Mac & cheese was very popular however, I do not each cheese. The pork belly was delicious, apparently it's been brined for 5 days. I swear, cut through it was like cutting through butter. It was so tender and fell apart. It was played with 3 other sauces, a celery like mash, sherry red sauce and this pear fruit like sauce which is chilled. Regardless the sauces were amazing, I was about the lick the plate clean!  The Guinea fowl is a type of omnivorous bird. Kind of like a chicken but it was served with gnocchi. I said I don't eat cheese so I was a. It afraid of the ricotta cheese but it had none of that cheese flavor. It was plated on a beautiful marble looking slab. It also had a homemade Tabasco sauce and butternut squash sauce. All amazing with the gnocchi.  Pretty much , you must go there to eat!! MUST."}
{"text":"Must visit restaurant in Montreal. Third time at Robin Square, very perfect experience. Love the cocktails, would recommend Un Español a Paris."}
{"text":"First off, the waitress is really lovely and great to talk to. The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and cozy with wood brick and an interesting zebra pattern wall.   We ordered a soup of the day, pasta of the day and a latte. That day, it was spinach cheese soup and fetticuni. The lattes are made in a cup as large as a soup cup. The soup was a little smaller than the latte but was still satisfying and delicious. The pasta was delicious and the portion is just enough.   I would definitely recommend this place for a nice lunch with friends as the music isn't too loud and the noise is decent."}
{"text":"We found our experience to be pretty consistent with many of the other reviews. Like others, we dined here on our first night in Montreal. Waited approximately 30 - 40 minutes in line. The place is small but not overly tight - have been in smaller, tighter restaurants. Service is with smile. All were friendly and personable. The food is incredible and the pork belly as many have attested is PHENOMENAL! Be forewarned, however, the food is incredibly rich -- it's pork belly afterall, with a good chunk of fat. As for the drawbacks -- the line and limited menu. Having been once, I wouldn't necessarily go back but it is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The restaurant was much smaller than I expected but the atmosphere was cozy. The waitress was friendly and told us the business was family owned, so the menu selection may be smaller but the ingredients are fresh.  We got the Redneck sandwich and Mac and cheese. I loved the mac and cheese!! They were generous in their use of truffle, and I could taste the maple cinnamon sweetness in the ham as well. The pork in the sandwich was tender and the bbq sauce was on the sweet side as well.  The portions were really big though, and I think next time I would do half portions."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and got the pork belly and mac&cheese. They were delicious!!! Service is really nice and helpful as well. The server took the time to explain the dishes and even advised us that the portions were large. It was definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Came here at 11:30am on a Tuesday and we were seated immediately. We got the Mac and cheese, grilled cheese sandwich, soup of the day (split pea and other veggies) and pasta of the day (spaghetti pomodoro). The highlights Are the Mac and cheese (very truffly), grilled cheese sandwich and the homemade breads that came with our soup and salad. The pasta was bland. Service was good and very friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food and prices! We highly recommend the gnocchi and the Mac and cheese.  Restaurant had a family feel to it, everyone was very nice and food was excellent!"}
{"text":"I've heard of this place half a year ago and keep recommending it to all friends and family visiting Montreal without having trying it (I know, its a big no no ...) but I've never sen a restaurant with a 5 star rating despite having 200+ reviews. I finally got to try it two weeks ago and it did not disappoint.   We got to the restaurant very early (1h before opening) just to ensure we would make the first serving and the line only really started forming 20 minutes before opening. However, it was raining that day and that might have changed the length of the line. We were seated next to the wall and a waitress came and explained how the whole business was family owned, the dad and the mom were working in the kitchen while their three daughters were working the dining room!! Furthermore, most of the ingredients are locally sourced and everything is homemade!!  Service was not the fastest (took roughly 20 mins to get our food) but OMG the food was so impressive. We got the Montreal experience and the Mac and Cheese as well as a pudding chomeur and came out both stuffed from our meal. The Montreal experience was a large slab of pork belly, roughly the size of an iPhone 5s. The meat as well as the fat was melt in your mouth, like literally you would put it in your mouth and can feel like just melt. The skin was very crispy and puffed, it had the texture of a thin cheese puff. The pork belly itself was quite heavy but the apply sauce that came with it greatly helped to cut the fat. The parsnip puree also made a nice and lighter alternative to a potato puree. Needless to say, we ate the whole plate very very clean.   The mac and cheese was a cream based mac and cheese, definitely less cheesy than a typical mac and cheese. The pasta was amazing, with a good amount of chew. The sauce not overly rich and the best pat was hands down the maple glazed ham (real ham! and not the ham you put in a sandwich) was nicely chewy with a hint of sweetness. Mixed with the Mac and cheese it was heavenly.  Overall for the price paid, it was definitely on of the best meals we've had in Montreal!"}
{"text":"After a first failed attempt to dine here, we were lucky that our second attempt was succesful :)  The bachelor Lawn and Trent definitely wanted to try some new Canadian french cuisine and this had been on his list since day one... special thanks to the entire staff for accommodating a party of 16 at a restaurant that sits at least only 30  With a menu that focuses on seasonal items, The options at Robin Square are not vastly extensive... but don't let that deter you from dining in because you would be doing yourself a huge disservice from some of montreal's finest food  I was able to try the mac and cheese, sirloin steak with foie, and the \"ultimate experience\" (pork belly)  Mac and Cheese - christmas ham, roasted garlic infused cream with swiss and cream cheese infused with truffle oil - nestled in with the upper echelon of mac and cheeses, this mac and cheese had the perfect combination of textures... velvety smooth cheese with al dente macaroni.. many of the patrons who ordered this was extremely satisfied  Sirloin Steak with foie - 300g of top sirloin sous vide to a perfect medium rare topped with a nice knob of foie gras torchon, accompanied with a green pea puree and buttery mashed taters... sous vide is obviously going to give you a perfect temperature with your steak.. add in creamy torchon and you got yourself a deadly combination  Ultimate experience - brined, smoked, and braised pork belly with truffle celery-root puree, pear and apricot jam, wine and maple sauce - The portion of the pork belly was extremely generous paired well with the sweet and salty combo of the puree and wine-maple sauce  Le Robin Square was a fantastic way to end our wonderful trip in Montreal"}
{"text":"Fabulous food. A small location, but they make up for it! We loved everything we had, a creamy jalapeño onion soup, Caesar salad, small pizza, Mac and cheese with ham, and pork belly. 4 of us ate family style and couldn't finish our food. The complexities of the flavors are impressive and each bite was perfect. Everything they serve is made in house and from scratch.   Not only is the food impressive, but I was blown away by their hospitality! Since they can't seat too many at a time one of the members of the Robin family came outside and explained the menu, told us about their restaurant (family owned and operated), and made us feel welcomed and wanted. It made it worth waiting for a table! She also offered us a beverage to enjoy while we waited.  We were lucky to get there toward the end of their evening, or we likely wouldn't have gotten a table in a reasonable amount of time. All told we waited about 20 minutes for a table, and it was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing lunch. Small, charming space, lovely staff, huge portions and spectacular food."}
{"text":"Okay Yelp, you guys hyped me up too much for this place! It unfortunately fell short of my expectations, this review is a 3.5 stars.  We came on a Friday night, there were a lot of open tables, surprisingly. No wait whatsoever, so I was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is nice and cozy; a small restaurant with a second floor seating area. Our server explained how the restaurant was family run and sources their ingredients locally, which definitely adds to the experience.  They have a small menu, so of course you'd expect them to perfect every dish.   Here's the scoop on the food: We got the toast cheese tartlette to share as a starter. (party of 3) The rich goat cheese was incredible with the caramelized onions and tomatoes! This dish was well balanced and was an exceptional start to the meal.  I got the famed mac n cheese, but I also got to try the pork belly and the steak. First off, the mac n cheese delivered an amazing first bite. The truffle flavour really kicks everything off, and goes really well with the sweet cream based sauce. The pulled ham was sweet and mild, with the perfect texture. It was all topped off with a cheese cracker and a few greens.The macaroni texture was definitely off though. Really dense and sticky, but not like al dente. The general heaviness of the dish made it rather hard to finish. I'm a little confused about the raving reviews on the mac. It was delicious, no doubt (I love truffle sooooo much), but there was definitely room for improvement and balance.  Here are the other things I got a few bites of: The sous vide steak was an amazing dish however. The meat was tender, a perfect medium rare, served on a bed of mushrooms and a pea purée sauce. The side of polenta also made the dish so much more comforting. I can see why this dish would be double the price of the mac n cheese.  The pork belly was cooked perfectly, tender but not falling apart. However, it was WAY TOO briny. Saltiness overcame the flavours, and my friend was unable to finish because it was too salty. The sweet maple wine sauce and the vegetable purée was able to save it, imo. This dish lacked balance as well.  Anyways, food was delicious and I would say it's worth a try. I think they over price their items because of their reputation, but then again it's a top restaurant in old Montreal."}
{"text":"A tight little spot. Came here during my last trip to Montreal, and I just could not pass up a restaurant with a ton of raving Yelp reviews!   It's on the pricey side and was packed when I visited. I had the Mac and Cheese and while it was good, I think the hot sauce was the star of this dish."}
{"text":"A must try if you are nearby. Delicious farm to table dishes and made from scratch - pretty much everything - breads, sauces, beverages, even wines. Friendly staff with excellent customer service in a great atmosphere. My husband and I had the cauliflower soup, poutin, and the braised bbq ribs; absolutely delicious.  UPDATE: The food and overall experience exceeded our expectation the first time around to the point that we decided to return two days later prior to heading back to the US and once again our visit did not disappoint. This time we had the Mac and cheese with brisket, chocolate dessert and the cauliflower cream soup (again because it's amazing). Delicious food and an awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Will never forget the taste of the mac and cheese! According to the waitress, almost all the ingredients are sourced from Montreal!  I love everything about this place, will return everytime I come to Montreal"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING and worth the wait! The pork belly melted in your mouth and the mac and cheese was so creamy! They have a great list of beers and we enjoyed the Saison and IPA beers! We'd like to come back again before the end of our trip!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food! If you stick to one thing, get the Mac and Cheese! Yeah sounds simple enough, but very complex and tasty! Not to sound like a snob, but coming from someone visiting from New Orleans...it's worth a taste or two."}
{"text":"I found this place purely due to it's rating on Yelp.  Almost turned around when I saw the place but I persevered and didn't regret a second of it.  Had one of my best meals EVER!  It was good enough for me to create an account on yelp just so that I can write a review.  This is a family run restaurant that prides itself on local food where available.  The menu is short but for good reason as it allows them to focus on doing a few items extremely well.  I'll definitely come back on my next trip through Montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing food, especially the melt-in-your-mouth Ultimate Experience pork belly. Small, unique selection of craft beers and good choice of wines to pick from. Cauliflower soup with homemade habanero had the perfect amount of spice. Desert was equally tasty with apples and maple.  Service is top notch with friendly and attentive servers. Restaurant is run and staffed by family and friends who make you feel right at home. Very courteous answering wild questions. Recommend reservations as this place is popular."}
{"text":"We loved this place. It is a family owned and run establishment. So welcoming, and the food is excellent. It is a limited menu, but every item is well thought out. We were visiting Montreal, and ended up there for dinner the first night, had almost everything on the menu, and came back again the next evening. The Mac and Cheese and French onion soup were stand out, but everything that we had was excellent."}
{"text":"There was a bit of a line when we arrived, and the wait turned out to be a bit longer than we were originally told, but they gave us a free drink and dessert because of the long wait.  We got two orders of the Mac n' Cheese and one order of the the Ultimate Experience for three people. Our favorite was the Mac n' Cheese, but both were great! Make sure you get the hot sauce that is 'hot' rather than 'medium' as the pepper flavor from the 'hot' one went so much better with the Mac n' Cheese than the pepper flavor from the 'medium' one."}
{"text":"What's not to love? The food, atmosphere, Silvia, and the entire Robin family! It was really a perfect meal. My husband and I decided to have a sampler. To start, we shared the Caesar salad (and let me tell you, this isn't your average Caesar salad - I'm talking chorizo, chipotle chicken, soft boiled egg), then the mac & cheese (it's divine - less cheesy and more creamy, it's hard to describe), and finally the gnocchi that had a Mexican twist. Sadly, we were far too full for dessert. Silvia was a complete sweetheart and we spent time talking about travel, baking, the future, etc. If you love intimate, family run restaurants...this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Totally cool family run joint! Family of four shared the mac  n cheese (creamy truffle goodness), the ultimate experience (skillfully prepared pork belly with a whirlwind of flavors), and the beat salad (fresh, simple, good). Definitely a place to check out when in Montreal (for tourists and locals alike).   My only constructive criticism would be that they play the music quite loud making dinnertime conversation hard... but the meal is well worth it."}
{"text":"Best food, Robin worked every table at lunch time she was super busy but food spoke volumes so delicious!  Family run business.  Everything was cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the giggly lady's service was top notch. It felt like I was eating at someone's house. But so warm and lovely"}
{"text":"Amazing food! We ordered the pork belly and the mac and cheese; both were amazing, especially the pork belly. Hands down the best meal I had in Montreal. Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the best meal I've ever had. Tried a bit of the big caesar salad, the special mac and cheese, and ate the entirety of my \"Ultimate Experience\" dish. Everyone here was extremely friendly, and this seems like the perfect spot for a date."}
{"text":"July 7 Well, we returned the next day for the creme brûlée cause they ran out the day before. While there we tried out the dinner menu...just as incredible as the lunch. We shared the burrata pizza and the pork belly; very impressed. These are two items that we rarely or don't get; margherita pizza is normally boring and pork belly sounds gross. We were wrong on both accounts. The pizza was super flavourful but delicate tasting; the homemade dough, homegrown tomatoes, and fresh burrata cheese truly make this the best margherita pizza you'll ever have. The pork belly simply melted in our mouths; the additional sauces and bread that accompanied it were devoured with it. We ended, of course, with the creme brûlée which was \"the best I've ever had\" according to my wife. Again, the service was excellent. If you're in Montreal do yourself a service and visit this fine establishment.   July 6 Wow, this place served us an exceptional lunch!  The microbrew beers were great; my wife had the stout and I had the IPA. We shared the spinach salad and the Mac and cheese with ham and a side of hot sauce (required to balance the sweetness of the ham).  It's all about the details and this place delivered; everything is house made and delicious.  The service was as good as the food: helpful, energetic, friendly, and knowledgable.  We recommend this place and will definitely return next time in town."}
{"text":"Please don't leave Montreal without coming here! What I would've give to have this in Toronto. Toronto.  Okay. So I saw 5 stars and thought come on no way. How is 5 stars possible? Elaine, lower your expectations or you will be disappointed. Let me tell you, expectations were not lowered and I was not disappointed. Le Robin Square is sooo deserving of 5 stars  You HAVE to try the mac and cheese. It's what dreams are made. We almost didn't order the mac and cheese because it was $18 and I could make KD for $2. How good can mac and cheese get I thought? Oh boy how I was wrong. Mac and Cheese can be freaking good. It had so many layers of multifaceted flavours.  The Christmas ham is roasted with maple syrup and cinnamon and gave the dish a sweetness that complemented the creamy, cheesy and garlicy sauce. The whole dish topped with truffle oil sealed the deal.  Cute crab dishes also came with the dish to allow for sharing and and made me squeal with excitement and subsequently took a bajillion pictures of for insta. I still can't stop thinking about this dish. I didn't want it to end and literally savored the pasta piece by piece near the end.   The pork belly was stellar. Tender, juicy and well-seasoned. Not only do the chefs here focus on the centerpiece of the meal, the puree are also top notch. This particular dish came with a sweet (apricot and pear) and savory (celery root) puree. The flavours were so concentrated and fabulous. I ended up scraping the plate clean.  While the guinea fowl with gnocchi and butternut squash puree would be an excellent standalone dish at any other restaurant, the previous two completely overshadows this one. It was a tad on the dry side for my liking and the flavours weren't as complex as the former two. This place opens at 6pm for dinner. We arrived a couple minute after 6 and there was already a line forming. To avoid having to wait for the second seating, do come here right when it opens.  To top off the experience, the service was so friendly and informative. We got a backstory of the restaurant (it's family owned and operated) and where they source their ingredients.  You can really taste the love the chefs put into the food here. I'll be dreaming about this place."}
{"text":"The food can be on the heavy and sweet side. But in general it is good. The line is not as long as it was described in Yelp. But the place is very small so a little bit of delay in arriving can make a big difference in when you will get your food. The service is super nice."}
{"text":"Apparently, as of today, this is the best restaurant in Montreal according to Yelp. Does it live up to that expectation? Personally, no, but that doesn't mean the food isn't by all means good; it just wasn't outstanding like I expected it to be.  The ambience of Le Robin Square definitely was grander than what I pictured yet simplistic at the same time. Its two floor dining area is very cozy with the high ceilings adding an extra touch of unexpected warmth. The place's location in Old Port definitely makes it tourist fodder (proven by the fact that I saw quite a few anglophone tourists there), but at least it's not all hype and no substance.  I ordered the mushroom soup and the mac and cheese with pulled ham. The mushroom soup was divine; it was perfectly creamy yet full-bodied with the meaty texture of - obviously, mushrooms. I finished it eagerly awaiting the main meal.   While the mac and cheese tasted good, the thing that bothered me the most was that the pasta and cream sauce seemed to be lacking some flavor, even with the addition of some spicy sauce on the side (which, like most \"spicy\" food in Montréal, wasn't spicy at all). It tasted more like pasta cooked in a very light cream sauce rather than the cheesy goodness that I'm used to. The bright spot of the dish was the pulled ham, and as someone who doesn't normally like ham at all, it was the perfect combination of light sweetness with a natural smoked and savory flavor of the pork.  Maybe I'll come here another time to try out their pork belly since I'm a huge fan of it when cooked properly. For mac and cheese, however, I might stick to less upscale yet more cheesy versions in the near future (for example, Dinette Triple Crown's)."}
{"text":"Found this place based on it's yelp reviews. It's a small family establishment and the menu is relatively limited.  I was a bit surprised at the set up of the place. It's smaller than I expected. The plastic seats made it look like a fast food place vs a restaurant. They do have an upstair seating area, and the live band places downstairs. If you seat downstairs it's a bit more snug fit vs upstairs. You can't see band upstairs but you hear them well.   Onion soup (with Jalapeño)-  This was a big bowl of soup. Definitely can be shared by 2 people. I am not the biggest fan of onion soup but the jalapeño gave it a nice kick.  The Ultimate Experience - I love pork belly so i couldn't wait to taste this. Not their fault but my palate did NOT like the Celery Root puree (I think that's what it was). I never had it before but eck, I realize now that I am not a fan. The other puree on the plate was on the sweeter side so I used that to offset the celery root flavor.  Pretty much the celery root taste made not enjoy the dish as much. I was pretty full off the soup so i did end up taking this dish home.   A friend of mine can't stand cilantro in ANY dish, now i guess I understand how she feels.   One other thing I didn't like,  the bread that was served with the soup and entree would have been good except it was HEAVILY slobbered in butter.   I couldn't enjoy it. I even tried scrapping some of the butter off...   Pistachio Creme Brûlée- Good combination. Light and not too sweet. Good portion.  The staff were very nice and even though if you seat upstairs you feel far away and you hope they didn't forget about you, they do come up to check on you often.  I didn't get to try the mac and cheese which also seem to be crown favorite, so maybe next time. If they had it in smaller portion I prob would have ordered it for take away vs an entree size portion."}
{"text":"When I saw 5 stars with almost fifty reviews I was curious.  Well ate there tonight and was surprised at how good the whole experience was. Our waitress/hostess was terrific and engaging despite the crowd. The food was outstanding from the soup to the beet salad to the pork  cheeks. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm glad we had a chance try this place. Its one of the yummiest food I'ved ever had.   As I look on some reviews, it takes them 1.5 hours of wait or longer just to dine in this restaurant. I felt good since we just walk in & got a table on the spot. When you're hungry thats the last thing you want to do, wait for too long. I'm not really that person. I hate waiting. Lol.   We got seated on the second floor. The restaurant is in good size if you compare it to nyc restaurants but I guess in montreal its small. The place is simple & elegant. While our waitress explains the food she also said its a family own restaurant that the owner is Robin thats also serving that time were there, her mom & brother works in the kitchen.   Food: Incredible mac & cheese- christmas ham, roasted garlic infused cream, swiss cheese, cream cheese & truffle oil. I'm not a fan of mac & cheese but I still choose to order this because its sounds interesting & I have my bf with me to eat the food incase I don't like it. Hahaha! But damn! The best of all mac & cheese I''ved ever had. Its not the usual mac & cheese. Its a little sweet, I think its because of the ham. Delicious!   The ultimate experience- brined, smoked pork belly, truffle celery puree, pear, apricot jam, wine & mapple sauce. This take up to 5 days to make. So the brother takes care of this process. Very soft, juicy & the sauce is awesome!   Definitely worth the visit. Food, vibe & the best service you'll ever experienced!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, fantastic food, and a phenomenal atmosphere. I'm trying to think if I have had a better meal, but nothing comes to mind. It was hands down one of the best, if not the best, meals of my life. Fantastic.   I came here by myself. After being encouraged by the couple next to me to try the beet salad,  I decided to dive in (I have never been a fan of beets). It was fabulous. My main course was the mac and cheese; It was probably the most unique and delicious dish I have ever tasted. To finish things off, I had a glass of the maple whiskey. A very mellow and slightly sweet drink.   I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"OK, Le Robin Square is now synonymous with Montreal for me.  My colleague and I returned after a year, and Sylvie remembered us and that I had written a review for them.  This is one of those rare places where quality trumps quantity, and you leave completely satisfied.  It is amazing what they do with little more than 1/2 dozen menu items.  My colleague and I shared one of their small pizzas as an appetizer.  Thin crispy crust and topped with a soft Italian cheese that they have flown in every week.  You spread it around with a knife on the vegetables and herbs and enjoy.  For the main course, I ordered The Ultimate Experience, pork belly accompanies by some amazing sauces and a slice of Mama's homemade bread.  I really didn't know what to expect, but it was so tender and the sauces mixed savory and sweet to perfection.  We were treated to two signature desserts: cheesecake in a jar and a little bread pudding with maple syrup.  I'll be back again and again.  I just might convince my daughter to apply to college here, so I'll have more excuses!"}
{"text":"It's very rare that I say this but Le Robin Square in Old Montreal is WORTH the 1.5 hour wait!  It's a small family-owned business with Robin's mom cooking in the kitchen and her brother braising the pork belly for 5 days.  Robin and her sister were very cheerful and accommodating as servers.    Keep in mind that it's a small restaurant.  Our group of 6 people had to let smaller groups of 2-3 people pass whenever a single table was available since we had to wait for the big table that seats 5-6 people.  We arrived at Le Robin Square a little before 8:30pm and were the last to get seated at 10pm.  They do close at 10pm but because it's a family business and they appreciate their customers waiting on line, we were welcomed to continue eating past 11pm.  The Mac n Cheese DID run out at around 9pm but Robin recommended their pork belly dish called \"The Ultimate Experience\" ($34).  I followed her suggestion and got the pork belly, which literally MELTS in your mouth (must be from the 5 days of braising!).  The dish comes with two different sauces for dipping: a creamy, thick celery-root puree and a sweet fruit jam made from apricots and pear.  I seriously should have asked her for the recipe!  The celery puree was my favorite but they were both incredible. (I licked... well, forked, my entire plate clean even after I was done with the pork belly).  This was honestly my best meal in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Food is extremely great!!! What a surprise. We ordered Mac and cheese, pork belly and skirt steak. All GREAT!"}
{"text":"You know you are going to love a place when one of the owners comes to your table & explains each and every dish (all family recipes) and gives you a BIG hug and a kiss when you leave! This is a MUST if you want some authentic Montreal cuisine, family recipes (including Christmas ham) that are an absolute sensation! I'm not too risky of an eater but went outside of my comfort zone tonight. I am now a fan of pork belly. Their recipe is out of this world! And I don't normally think of getting onion soup, but I'm SO GLAD we tried this!!! Even the drink I got (I wanted a rum & coke but she recommended ginger & rum) was unbelievably delicious!! If Yelp had a 10 star  rating..you guys would get a 10 al the way!! We WILL BE BACK, for sure!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars!! Greeted by owner Sylvia at the door. We just missed getting in for the first round, but we were able to have a drink near the door. Sylvia was engaging and so sweet! A great front of the house person!  Now the food!! I LOVE to eat and usually never get full! Always room for a little dessert. Here, be prepared!! You WILL be full. Rich flavored food leaves you satisfied! He had he mac n cheese and brisket stew. Amazing dishes!! Mac n cheese is rich and no cheese. A little sweet from ham and salty as well. So good!! The meat was perfect!! We were told it took 48 hours to make the beef! And the free cheesecake dessert at the end of our meal was amazing!! The staff are attentive and the place is clean and funky.  There will be a wait, but it's well worth it!! We missed this place  last visit as they were closed and made a special trip to Montreal from Boston en route to Quebec city just to come here! It was worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Oh man, this place did NOT disappoint.  They have very few things on the menu (only three main) but do they even make them well.   We each ordered a different dish (recommend and share!).  The Mac n cheese (which is technically more of a pasta than a Mac n cheese since it's made with cream and not cheese) with pulled ham (made with cloves and sweetness) was so unique and yummy. Mix it well and even add some hot sauce.  It all blends so well together.   Next, was the pork belly.  If you only get one dish, get this one.  The Mac n cheese is delicious but this is another kind of works. It melts in your mouth and pulls apart with ease.  Juicy and tender, every bite is delicious.   You know those meals where, with each bite you're thinking \"man, this is so good\"?  This is it. Every bite to the last bite.  Best pork I've had since Segovia, Spain.   Highly recommended.  And it's a family run joint."}
{"text":"I don't even know how to start. Everything is perfect!! Deciding to eat here was the best decision I made during my stay in Montreal. Location is easy to find, decor is absolutely beautiful, staff members are extremely friendly, and omg the food. Apparently everything is locally sourced and homemade. The portions are HUGE but my sister and I ate EVERYTHING. We got the spinach salad that had warm goat cheese on top and a grilled cheese with mango dipping sauce. So good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to this place for our brunch. We were surprise how simple the menu was, but also how good the food they serve. Is a family business with soul and passion. Food is really good, portion big enough to be full and atmosphere is just great. Thank you for very good time Robin. We will come back:)"}
{"text":"I'm giving a two star review for a few reasons, not based on the food alone. For the price range, it is about average, perhaps a 4 star review if you had an overall good experience,  1. OVERRATED. I do not understand where all these 5 star reviews are coming from! I came here based on Yelp alone, which is usually a sure bet, but perhaps there are a lot of tourists with little to compare rating 5 star; the old port is notoriously touristy, overpriced, and overrated.   2. My pork belly was gelatinous and frankly, made me nauseous! Avoid."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I have ever had.  The family staff were fantastic, the food incredible, and the ambience perfect.  We were a party of 9 in Montreal for my bachelor party and despite the number, we were quickly accommodated.  Between the 9 of us we tried several plates of the Beef Shoulder, Ultimate Experience (pork belly), and the mac and cheese.  All three meals were fantastic!  We immediately started thinking of excuses why we had to drive back to Montreal just to eat dinner here.  Thank you Robin family for such a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"It was our first wedding anniversary. My wife and I were visiting Montreal for the first time. On our last night in the city, we were exhausted from sightseeing all day and decided to have dinner in. We were staying at an Airbnb around the block from the restaurant. When I popped-in to place the order, I was met by the most charming hostess. While multitasking, she graciously took my order, making recommendations and engaging me in conversation. I returned within 20 minutes and the order was ready. (The restaurant was busy, so this was impressive.) She even surprised us by giving us a complimentary homemade dessert order to celebrate our anniversary. The food was to die for! The favors were complex and the presentation was beautiful. Don't miss out on this place!"}
{"text":"Very friendly.  Nice atmosphere.  Came here by myself and sat at the counter.  The angus sirloln was cooked to PERFECTION.  Was a sizeable piece and DELICIOUS, but after getting into it, learned that about 20% of it was FAT.  They should have cut that off.  Came with a small side of mashed potatoes, and some kind of green peppercorn sauce.  No vegetables?  Would have been nice to have some local asparagus or greened beans?  Meal was $45.  Seemed expensive to me."}
{"text":"Best meal in Montreal! Family owned, local food, meals prepared fresh and come in generous portions. I had the pork belly which took 5 days to prepare and came out to perfection. It came on top of Yukon mashed potatoes which tasted fresh and made ready to eat. Also, the service was beyond exceptional. Sylvia, the server and daughter of the Robin family was excellent. She talked about the family owned restaurant, explained the menu thoroughly and was very friendly. She even offered to take pictures of my boyfriend and I after watching us take our own photos. She gave us recommendations for things to do and places to go out for the rest of our stay in Montreal. The entire experience wasn't just a restaurant meal, it was as if we were welcomed into a family's home for the evening. Check it out, it's a must!"}
{"text":"OK, so the loong line.....first of all don't let that discourage you. If i had to wait 3 hours i would, because this place was AMAZING!!  Our table had the pork belly, Mac & Cheese and Cod fish. Then a delicious dessert to finish off.   EVERYTHING WAS SOOO GOOD!! Seriously, the Pork belly was the most delicious and tender i have EVER tried. Mac & Cheese??!..BOOOM, amazing..Cod fish...ummm, HELLOOO AWESOME!!  The portions are incredible, and trust me you WILL finish it all. Not because its small but because you don't want to stop eating!  The staff, well our hostess was incredibly cool and funny and very understanding. She made the night even better by just talking with our table and making sure her clients were pleased.  IF YOU ARE IN MONTREAL THIS IS A MUST STOP!!!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype.  Probably our best meal in Montreal.  Definitely the best Mac and cheese I've had in my life.  Ask for their housemade hot sauce.    They are a family owed and run spot near Notre Dame Basilica.  The waitress is very friendly.  Food is just right, not too heavy.  We also ordered the soup.  I would come again and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant, run by a talented family, all with culinary training, and very gracious. The food was exceptional, in a relaxed and friendly setting!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!!!!! We've been traveling for a week on the east coast and this here was the best dinner I've had all week and honestly the best I've had in a really long time. The Rigatoni was incredible!!!! The service was amazing and all the food was made by the same family that owned it, fresh and daily."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall near Notre-Dame is a mixed blessing. The wait was unpleasant at over 30 mins out in the cold but the food is phenomenal, everything we tried was fantastic!  Space is at a premium in this family-run place and they don't take reservations, hence the wait. Once inside, the ambiance is cozy and simple - very welcoming. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu - everything explained in detail, the fact that there are less than 10 items on the menu probably helps (desserts excluded).  We had the onion and jalapeño soup, smoked salmon, \"Ultimate Experience\" and the mac and cheese. The soup was creamy and nicely spiced. The Ultimate Experience was aptly named, I don't think I have ever eaten a better piece of pork in my life - excellent sauce, too. The meat literally melted on the tongue - an experience indeed. The mac and cheese was a little strange - with ham and cinnamon - but that was a very good combination as well.   After having the home made cheesecake, I can die happy. The little stick of dark chocolate takes away from the cheesecake flavor, might as well leave that alone.  All in all: it was worth the wait - would certainly go again.  Note: In spite of a photo of Poutine on Yelp - this place does not serve Poutine! That was a one time thing and it's not on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Friendly service, family run, delicious comfort food.   Food: For 2, we ordered the beet salad and the famed mac and cheese (it was a heavy day of walking and snacking)! The beet salad consisted of mainly beets, with some goat cheese and candied walnuts. The mac and cheese was divine - not overly heavy, but the macaroni had a great texture to it (if macaroni could be cooked al dente this would be it), and the sweet and tender Christmas ham and the hot sauce were perfect complements.   Tips: No reservations, come early (like before 6pm) if you don't want to wait long. Also it's fairly casual, just really good tasty comfort food.   The restaurant is almost completely family run and the vibe is so great. The kitchen is pretty open and our waitress (Ms. Robin) is so friendly and sweet!"}
{"text":"Was never a Mac and cheese fan. But after trying their version of it, I was hooked. The blend of ham, truffle oil and cream with the occasional kick of hot sauce was a delight to the taste buds. Their pork belly dish, called the ultimate experience was rightly so. 3 different sauces: sweet, savory and salty. You could dip each one, make your own combination or clean it off with \"mom's\" bread. This family run restaurant is as cozy, authentic and delicious as it gets."}
{"text":"Been to this place twice already and I love it every single time. Every item on the menu is flavorful and delicious and the waiters are very friendly. Great service and food overall!"}
{"text":"Everything  I ate was delicious. Mac and Cheese was amazing. The hospitality was inviting and I would visit again"}
{"text":"I really can't say enough about my fabulous my experience at Robin Square. I've used Yelp for months and have never felt so compelled to leave a review before.  The food here is fabulous. Local, fresh, all homemade in an unbelievably tiny kitchen by a local family. We had the pork belly and the gnocchi dish, and while both were five-star worthy, the pork belly was absolutely melt-in-your-mouth divine. For our party of four, we also ordered all four of their desserts to share for the table (chocolate strawberry tarts, cheesecake with raspberry jam, maple cream cake, and creme brûlée), and all four were executed perfectly. If you are a creme brûlée fan, this was one of the best I've had in a long time.  The only hesitation we had was the size of the restaurant, but my party of four went at about 7:45pm on Saturday evening and we only waited about 25 minutes. Silvia, our hostess and waitress, was kind and friendly, and even offered to pour is a glass of wine as we patiently waited for a table. The service and quality of food was by far worth the little bit of wait we had in the beginning of our visit.  I'm only in Montreal a few more days, and I already intend to return to Le Robin Square for another meal before I leave. You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Wow. 2 staples on the menu, pork belly and Mac and cheese, plus a seasonal rotating item.   The food is excellent, high quality, rich, delicious.  Family run restaurant, with mom and son in the kitchen and the daughters serving.    So friendly and welcoming, very casual atmosphere, a must.   Breaking news!  They are moving locations in February, new place will only be 2 blocks away.  Im told the same great food, service and family running the new place."}
{"text":"Wow, this place knows how to make food!  I had The Ultimate Experience and it was incredibly rich especially with the varieties of sauces that came with it.  They also had a Touriga National wine available which was also awesome since I love Portuguese wine.  The only bad thing was that I felt like I had a brick in my stomach after everything, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"I orderd the pork, it is a little expensive, the meat is a little sweat, and their cream is also a little sweat, i would like to try more."}
{"text":"Top 5 entree I've had in my life after traveling to 32 countries and eating at Michelin starred restaurants. The pork belly had two light and sweet purées, plus a maple sauce. I melted in my seat. Worth a trip only to eat this dish. Seasonal, so make sure it's on the menu.  dessert (good, not great) butternut squash soup (good, not great)  Service: friendly, family-owned environment"}
{"text":"The food was good. Solid. I would not say I was blown away. The restaurant informed us that it was family owned and the ingredients were fresh from the farm, and that was the reasoning for the small menu. I would say that I wished there was more to their menu, maybe just 1 or two options more.    The salmon was very fresh. The pork belly was good but I've had better. The mac and cheese was slightly disappointing as we were not expecting it to be more sweet than savory.  Wines available were a nice touch."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Came back to Montreal primarily to dine here again.  Loved the Mac and Cheese and the pork belly. They changed location, so be aware of that. The new spot is terrific. They went upmarket but didn't increase prices on their previous dishes."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, perfect for groups. Very busy at night so it took time to get the food."}
{"text":"This quaint size of this cool local has nothing in common with its service and dishes. As the Silvia said, \"keep it simple' keep it local and keep it fresh!\" What a winning formula. A definite must try! Thanks to all the Robin's for the great experience."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here on our last night in montreal based on the reviews. We had the pork belly and mac n cheese. Even though we weren't starving we finished all of the food. You could tell time was put into cooking the meals as the taste of the meat was superb. Loved the small family owned restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Number one for a reason on here - go now! Amazing food. Best ever MAC n cheese and the pork belly is the best I've eaten too!!!"}
{"text":"Vraiment une belle découverte. Un petit resto dirigé par une famille. J'ai pris le plat de porc qui était vraiment d'un autre monde, trop bon. Microbrasserie de Shawi, la bière est vraiment excellente. Très bonne sélection de bières IPA. Vraiment une belle adresse à découvrir en ami ou en amoureux."}
{"text":"Wow this place was beyond expectations. Couldn't have been happier with our choice for NYE dinner. As previously mentioned this place is very unassuming but the food!!!  OMG!  Had the crusted brie and goat cheese as 1st course and then the ultimate experience and macaroni with brisket. Everything was amazing but I have to talk about the mains. The macaroni and briskett with truffles was by far the best macaroni I've ever had. I was so full but I wanted more. The pork belly was smoked to perfection and had several delicious sauces that you could somehow all taste separately. The pork belly was so tender as it had been cured as well. One of the owners, Rachel, gave us tastings of all their home made hot sauces as well as some of the wines to help us decide which we liked the best. Rachel is also the artist of all the fabulous portraits. We will definitely be back when in Montreal. They will also be moving into a larger space in Feb and selling their hot sauces...which I will be buying!"}
{"text":"The mac and cheese and Robin Square is amazing and I have never seen service that was as nice as this one. The family who runs the restaurant goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"It was so good we had to come back twice. The cream of onion soup was fantastic, and the Mac and cheese was a work of art. Portions were very generous. Our kids (7&15) liked the food too, and the staff was really nice to our youngest."}
{"text":"This review is only related to the service of the establishment - I cannot comment on the food.  I called early in the afternoon for guidance on when to arrive for a 6 PM seating for two and I was told it shouldn't be a problem and was (Issue 1) given no warning whatsoever of still having to arrive early as a line forms outside the restaurant prior to opening (seemingly a regular occurrence).   Having arrived early anyway by about an hour, I waited at a nearby Starbucks until shortly before 6pm.  Upon approaching the restaurant, I noticed a line had already formed which I immediately got on. At about 6:05 or so they began letting people in and unfortunately my wife and I were the first people to not get seated and were told we could wait 1.5 to 2 hours for a table to open up for us.  At this point we noticed a party of 2 was taking up 6 seats as the rest of their party had not yet arrived (and did not arrive until 15 minutes later (the owner messaged this to me as I had already left in disgust) - Issue 2).  Had I either been told to arrive in advance of opening (Issue 1) and/or the restaurant had a policy of not seating incomplete parties (Issue 2) could I have actually had a meal here.  i.e., if you'd like to avoid an extended wait for dinner I suggest arriving no later than 30-40 minutes before dinner service begins though it's clearly acceptable for an incomplete party to be \"completed\" with a 15 minute delay"}
{"text":"Ate here with the whole family (5). Had to wait about 30 minutes, but it was worth it! Every dish was excellent! We had the Mac and cheese, beef shoulder, pizza and the butternut squash soup. Very fresh and full of flavor! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a very very busy place for dinner, but their food taste fantastic. The Mac and Cheese was really great, taste different than other places. The pork belly is another thumb's up. There's a long wait for this restaurant since it's not a big place. When I came here, there are people waiting in line outside this place."}
{"text":"The best food I have ever eaten. I was waiting out in the cold for 2 hours with my friend who was steaming mad that I made him wait with me. But when he tasted the onion soup he said \"that's the best soup I've ever had\".  We had the ultimate experience and  the mac and cheese (cream based). I put some homemade hot sauce on my mac and cheese and actually saw fireworks. It was that good. Kinda pricey but worth it. Also the food is very rich in cream and butter. The quantity might not look like much, but it's so rich that it feels you up."}
{"text":"Absolutely overrated, we ordered mac & cheese and pork belly. Mac & cheese was a bit on the sweet side, and pork belly was too salty without slathering it in another rather sweet sauce.  The queue to get a table outside is a total mess.  Mostly whoever is closest to the door got seated first, disregard how long others have waited in line. The front of the house desperately need a system to manage the queue - may be should consider pen and paper?"}
{"text":"We had the Mac and cheese and the ultimate experience. The pork wasn't as tender as I would have thought, but it was still immensely delicious. My partner loved his Mac and cheese, although I found it a bit too sweet for my personal taste. All in all, I would recommend!"}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday. So fantastic. The servers were super friendly and service was quick. The pork belly was cooked to perfection.  This place is SMALL. Think hole-in-the-wall NYC small, but decorated well and they make due. I brought my 20 month old and they welcomed him and even let him color on the paper table cover. It is loud, but we loved it. The craft beer is a pretty good cherry on top.   Do it!"}
{"text":"To start off the service was above and beyond and gave a little history on the restaurant and that it is a family run establishment. We sat at the bar because we didn't have a reservation so make sure to do so if you plan to eat here. There was no diminishment in service it was actually impressive as my wife couldn't decide which wine to have and he made sure she was satisfied with her choice even let her sample wines sold by the bottle. If we lived here this would be no doubt at least a once a week visit. I haven't even gotten in to the food. We had the The Ultimate (Pork Belly) and mac and cheese w/pulled pork and after the first bite started slicing off smaller portions to fully engage all the flavor and savor it. To say the least it was amazing, I am from the southern US in which we think we run things when it comes to BBQ and pork NOPE! Ill probably get in trouble for that but its the truth. A Must if near Old Montreal"}
{"text":"One of the best meals of my life. No exaggeration. The pork belly is insanely good. The service was great. It's a small family-owned establishment. They clearly take a lot of pride in their work and It shows."}
{"text":"One of my favorite parts of traveling to new cities is finding the cute little restaurants that deviate from the norm in both their demeanor and their menu, and Le Robin Square is just that and more. After researching probably over 20 restaurants, my boyfriend and I settled on Le Robin Square due to its unique and eclectic menu and I could not be more happy that we did, as this restaurant managed to completely exceed my expectations. Although it may be small, the menu is very diverse and offers an interesting array of Canadian/French-style eats and I'm sure that each dish is as good as the next. I had the Mac and Cheese, and, if you read any other Yelp reviewer's thoughts, I agree with each and every one of them. I am a huge proponent of all things black truffle and the inclusion of it in this dish is absolutely perfect, so I highly recommend it to anyone in the same boat. My date had the Guinea Fowl, which was also very good (it is also the most expensive thing on the menu, but when converted to US dollars, not terrible). We shared the pistachio crème brûlée that we were told the mother had decided to make on a whim, of which I am grateful for because it was excellent.  If you are impatient and are more on the uptight side when it comes to restaurants, save this one for those who aren't and will actually appreciate it for the gem that it is. They do not take reservations, which, in my opinion, works rather well for them. We arrived around standard dinner time and there was a small wait outside the door and we waited roughly an hour to be seated. Contrary to standard restaurants, the waitress took our order while we waited for our table and was extremely friendly and conversational. She said she was the sister of the Robin family and told us all about her brother, the Chef, and all of her close family friends working the restaurant. She was absolutely adorable; every time she walked past us, she would greet us in a sing-songy tone or even be singing along to whatever interesting music was playing over the stereo. Although there was a significant wait, one can only expect so much, as both the kitchen and the dining areas are tiny. The staff was impressively attentive for being so busy as well, each and every one of them made sure we had everything we needed on multiple occasions. Overall, this is a fantastic restaurant with food that you will eat way past your personal capacity because of how incredible it tastes and a very comfortable, pleasant atmosphere that makes you feel much at home (at home with much better food, in my case)."}
{"text":"They cultivate a local, chill vibe without being pretentious. Expect a rich, hearty entrée. Great staff."}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese ham is so good! My kids wanted more afterwards. The owner is super cute and nice. I wish I lived in Montreal so I can come back. If you are in town you do not want to miss!"}
{"text":"The success of Robin Square is awesome and delightful. This restaurant is family run and owned and there is passion in every little thing they do, ever since they started as a small sandwich shop open only for lunch hours in Old Montreal. The family recipes are true Quebecois comfort food. Cosy and delicious and welcoming and served with heart and love for their customers, it's hard to think what mor eyou might want (although I'm not going to lie, the decor both bugs me and I love it. C'est Quebec-style for sure.) They've earned their spot on Yelp. Folks will debate whether the top spot should go to this or that other more famous restaurant and chef instead, but when it comes down to it, the super affordable price point, the family vibe, and the wildly cozy delicious local eats make it totally understandable that regular people, real Yelpers, keep giving them their stars again and again.   Pro tip: yes there are lines, but go a little late like for 8:30 or 9 and the lines die down and you can have a totally memorable feast and friendly evening."}
{"text":"It was a good dining experience for me but not so much for my friends. We had the Mac and cheese to share, I got the chicken and they both got the pork belly. On the first couple of bites, the pork belly was phenomenal, perfectly tender, juicy and melted in your mouth. It was probably the best pork I've ever had in a long while. The sauce was a good balance to the fatty belly with some sweetness. However, as they kept eating, they said they felt the dish got more and more greasy and they could barely finish it.  I got the chicken with gnocchi and butternut squash sauce. It was really good, I liked the gnocchi's dense texture and chicken was well seasoned as well.  However, the wait was kind of long and the service wasn't the best. We stood in front of the cashier waiting to pay for at least 10 minutes..."}
{"text":"Love this place. Tonya and I enjoyed the food, vibe, aesthetics, and the host Sylvia! Easy 5 star!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous, terrific food, the chef is excellent, the front of house is unbelievable friendly. Very family friendly and family oriented, I recommend everything on the menu. It is a little hard to hear in there because it's quite loud but other than that awesome place"}
{"text":"We were browsing Yelp for places to go near us and this place popped up. We ate here and it may have been the best decision of my trip. We were greeted by the owner, robin, and she made us, as Americans, feel right at home. We had to wait, and she got us drinks as we waited. Eventually we got seated and had arguably the best meal I've ever eaten. Out waitress was so attentive and the food was second to none. Everyone was very friendly, fantastic atmosphere, and such nice people. A bit pricy, but for the first time at a higher priced restaurant, I believed it was worth every penny and wouldn't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Definitely check this place out if you're looking for a fresh atmosphere with great service in the old town of Montreal. They do not take reservations. My wife and I showed up around 7pm on a Wednesday night and had to wait outside for about ten minutes before a table was ready.  We started with the blue cheese and celery soup which tasted exactly like...blue cheese and celery, which doesn't sound exciting but actually worked for some weird reason. Then I had the foie gras with  ginger spiced bread and citrus marmalade for dinner. It was a delicious combination. But my wife ordered the mac and cheese and this was the highlight of the meal (as so many others have already stated). You get a really nice balance of creamy cheese and truffle oil flavors, with super tender meat throughout. I like spicy food, so we opted to throw in the entire side of house made hot sauce, which did not overpower the dish, but just added an additional element to enhance the overall flavor experience."}
{"text":"Took my visiting brother to this place. The owner couldn't be more friendly and took the time to explain to us about the menu! It made me feel proud to show my visiting family member what Montreal dinning experience is all about!  The sauces on \"full experience\" meal was heavenly!  Porkbelly was fantastic! And yes... absolutely interesting Mac and cheese flavor! The only thing is this restaurant should has $$$ sign instead of $$.  It's on the slightly expensive side. Worth it though!! :)"}
{"text":"So I know I'll sound like one of those people - someone who comes on to give a negative review of a restaurant that others have been raving about. But I was really disappointed...  I had read here on Yelp about how wonderful this place is, and made a special effort to get there. When I arrived I was impressed - quaint and pretty cosy, and a great welcome from the staff. Not to mention a glass of wine while I was waiting for a table. So far so good!  The server introduced herself as the owner, sister to the chef. She was charming, and described the menu, and the specials. She mentioned that one of the dishes took her brother five days to make, and I considered ordering that, although, when I asked her whether I should choose it or the special, a steak, she recommended the steak (aged 30 days) in a red wine and shallot reduction. So that's what I opted for.  The first course was an onion soup, with a hint of jalapeño. It was phenomenal!  When it came to the steak, though... She asked me how I liked it. I like medium well. My brother will refuse to go below medium, she said. My eyebrow was raised. Oh, I said. (Now I know some of you are thinking, well, if he says he prefers it cooked more than medium-rare then he knows nothing about food. Trust me - I know what I like; more to the point, however, the philosophical question is, who should be the arbiter of taste, the chef or the patron? And if it's the chef, then why offer a choice at all?). Still, I agreed to the medium...  When the steak came, it was fine. Tender, yes, and not too bloody for my taste. But how come there's nothing else on the plate? Yes, there's the red wine reduction. And there's a hint of pureed sweet potato. Liquified, really. But that's it. No vegetable, and definitely no potato - roasted, boiled, dauphinoise, french-fried, mashed, croquette, or fried. Is it possible to get some french fries, I asked? No, came the regretful reply, we have no fryer.  Okay, no fryer - but couldn't the chef have considered an alternative? Shouldn't the waitress have asked if I would, given that, prefer something else? No.  Meanwhile, the red-wine and shallot sauce was... bland. It's not hard to do a red wine sauce. EvenI can do it. I look for the salt. Where's the salt? Nope, none available. Sigh.  Maybe dessert will be better. Creme brûlée with a coffee. The coffee comes first. Watery. It's either instant, or an americano made with poor espresso.  My last resort, the creme brûlée? The custard was curdled.  Finally, I go to pay the bill, no concern evident on the part of the servers that I didn't drink the coffee, and that I took only two teaspoons (one to taste and one to confirm) of the creme brûlée. Sigh.  Don't get me wrong. I almost never complain here on Yelp. I love food. I know good food (Eleven Madison? Yep! Daniel? Okay. Per Se? Eh. Bouley? Yummy) but I also adore comfort food. Maybe it was an off day at Robin Square. But it was the day I chose to go there. And I was really, really disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. Walked over from my hotel late on a Saturday night. They found a spot for me and are INCREDIBLY gracious. The food is unbelievable. Probably the best Calamari and Risotto I've ever had."}
{"text":"Fresh, mind blowingly tasty food, and all the girls taking your order are friendly. The service was very quick and all the food tastes as if its made with love. Don't come here with a party bigger than 4, the dining room is small! So worth the wait though. Try the mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Make sure you make a reservation if you go on the weekend: wife and I went some minutes after 5pm for early dinner without reservation and it was already half full! As minutes went by the restaurant got packed and there was a line outside. We ordered the spicy cauliflower soup, creamy, flavourful and delicious, it came with homemade bread which was great. We ordered the \"ultimate experience pork belly\" very tender, the waiter mentioned the whole process takes about 4 days to prepare it! Also we got the Mac and cheese - it was great but we couldn't finish it so we took the leftovers to go - delicious ok the next day still :D !"}
{"text":"Guys...it's hard for me to express how much I've thought about my meal at Le Robin Square. Absolutely in the top 5 meals of my life (and I love to eat).   We read the Yelp reviews and wondered if a #1 Yelp spot restaurant could be worth it (as many times they are overhyped). This one definitely was. We ordered the mac and cheese with ham and the \"ultimate experience\" pork belly dish - both were equally delicious. A flavor journey from beginning to end - that sounds cheesy (no pun intended), but there's little no other words to describe how awesome this meal was.  Our service was great and drinks were fabulous as well. This will be my first stop next time I'm back in Montreal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect example of a great family restaurant. Intimate setting with warm and charming service. Simple menu with only 5 items. Everything we ordered was well done and uniquely prepared. The last item on the menu, the pork belly was my family's favorite. Can't ask for better experience! Totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"i give a four star because its a bit too pricy spent around seventy for pork belly , vegetarian pizza and a dessert"}
{"text":"I had one of the best dining experiences of my life. It's a small place, seats 32, and doesn't take reservations. We were seated promptly after a short wait. We were greeted by the owner who was extremely friendly and helpful, and she reviewed in detail the entire menu, and suggested things and offered half portions. She and her family own and run the restaurant. I have never felt so welcomed as I did here.  The food was also wonderful. I had the pork belly and my spouse had a steak and both were superb. We also shared macaroni and cheese, and salad.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This small little quaint, almost hard to miss spot was a hit! We absolutely loved the vibe and the food. Menu is small but worth it, those are the types of places that truly have the best food. Our server was super nice and each plate that was brought was fully described which was helpful. We ordered the beef sirloin with creamy polenta and sweet pea purée along with the mac and cheese with Christmas ham which was delicious. Do not pass this place up. A true Gem!"}
{"text":"At 5 pm, we got in the restaurant. At first, we wanted to sit near the window and the staffs politely asked us if we can give our seats to the familles with children. The staffs let us sit in the second floor and we got an amazing view of the restaurant upstairs.   When we ordered, we all got the macaroni and cheese with four cheeses and it was amazing. All my friends love it.   Quite filling and delicious... The customer service is on pair, the staffs keep checking on us to see if we are alright. The water keeps filling up on our cup.   Overall, one of the best family owned restaurant out there. They made us feel at home."}
{"text":"Intimate spot for date night. This restaurant serves up some delicious (new) French Canadian comfort food. The menu is simple and short.   Came here for the Incredible Mac & Cheese after a friend recommended it and it was amazing. The Mac & cheese has roasted garlic infused cream, Swiss cheese, cream cheese, a hint of truffle oil & topped with Christmas Ham! While it's a bit pricey at $23, it's totally worth it as it tastes so unique!   We also ordered the $34 \"Ultimate Experience\", which seems to be another popular dish. It's a brined, smoked & braised Pork belly with purée & maple syrup.  The top of the pork belly was a bit too burnt for my liking. It tasted good but we've had much better pork belly in NY."}
{"text":"As with any review.. take this with a grain of salt. We flew all the way from SALT lake city, just to come to Robin Sal...Square and it did not disappoint. This place is SOdium good! It would be an inSALT to the city of Montreal not to come and check out this restaurant.   InSALTlate yourself with a good group of good friends, and ask to sit at the bar, for laughs all night. Come here any SEASON, and you will be sure to enjoy this place.   The Mac n Cheese is an asSAuLT on your taste buds.  Ne SEL pas yourself short on this place.   For reservations, call Saul-T 514-775-7258  Carpe So-diem."}
{"text":"I was told the mac and cheese here is amazing. And I thought how can mac and cheese be that good....I was blown away.  I ordered a onion soup and famous mac. The onion soup comes with half a slice of home made bread. Bread was a tad hard. But onion soup had alotnog flavour.  Now the mac, depending on how you eat it. Tastes sweet and salty. Topped with Christmas ham in truffle oil and cream, cream cheese this was amazing. Not ordinary mac and cheese.  The only reason not 5 stars it's cause it's a bit salty for both dishes. Service was great and ambiance was also good. Would definitely come back.  Soup-$8 Mac-$21"}
{"text":"ordered the Cornish Hen for two and the fresh burrata- both very delicious! The service, quality of food , and friendly staff made our first visit to Montreal a memorable one. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The mac n cheese is the best I have ever had in my whole life! You cannot go there without ordering it. The Robin family has created a fantastic restaurant and the kitchen staff and servers are incredibly attentive. They will not steer you wrong on menu selections or even entertainment in the city! Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"We are on our first visit to Montreal and this was a great meal for us after a trying flight experience.  We love local restaurants and the menu was billed as \"Canadian food\".  Chef was very accommodating with my nut and pit fruit allergies, which was a HUGE relief.    I tried the Sortilege, a mixer with Canadian whiskey and maple syrup.  It was quite good for this whiskey novice.   We went with the two most popular dishes-the Mac & Cheese and The Ultimate Experience.  The Mac & Cheese was accompanied by either hot sauce or extra hot sauce.  It was an apricot jam with jalapeño pepper and amped up the creamy mac & cheese beautifully.  The dish was topped with Chef Red's Christmas Ham and the entire mix was outta this world.   The Ultimate Experience was a Brined, Smoked, and Braised Nakano pork belly on top of a truffle-celery root purée with a maple wine sauce.  I had to skip the contrasting peach & apricot jam due to my allergies but I can vouch that the pork belly was exquisite.  Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and melted on the fork.    We topped the meal off with the maple syrup cake.  My Mr. noted it tasted like a crumbly pancake! It was rich and mapley, which was good after the hot sauce!  I had the lemon-Matcha Creme brûlée.  What an unusual combo and it was a perfect blend.  We loved this first meal in Montreal...."}
{"text":"Que buen lugar! No solo comimos excelente. Y comimos calamari, foi gra y salmón. Y tomamos. Bueno, lo que recomendó el barman y un tequila \"corralejo 99000\" que estaba... . El lugar esta  atendido por sus dueños. Una familia genial que podes descubrir con solo estar ahí, con ganas de conversar. La experiencia fue como estar en casa, solo que a 11hs de avión. Amazing. Volveremos varias veces durante nuestra estadía."}
{"text":"We ordered the Mac and cheese and the 'Experience', followed by the mango cheese cake. Everything was delectable, but very filling, so bring a hearty appetite. The service was down to earth, friendly and approchable. Every table has different dishes and they are very cute. We came here for my birthday and I am very glad that we did!  It appears as though most tables order the Mac and cheese and the experience - the two most popular dishes. They do not take reservations, so come early! It's a small restaurant. It's a family run restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a mic drop kind of place.  One of the 5 best places I've eaten at period.  Where to begin?  This is a smaller establishment with probably about 10 tables that can accommodate about 40 guests at once.  It's entirely family run, the 2 chefs are brothers and their sister and friends run the front of the house.  Everything is made in house and sourced locally.  The food they put out of their tiny kitchen is nothing short of magical.  The menu I assume changes seasonally as some offerings that made the Yelp photo gallery were no longer being offered.  That's OK.  These guys know their stuff.  The day we went, they had about 10 items on the menu but had to scratch the cod dish off due to a late delivery.  As we were ordering the chef was examining the fish, which arrived 7 hours late.  C'est la vie.  Let's get on with what we got to eat.  1.) Cream of Onion Soup w/Smoked Jalapeño - This was a great starter.  We all got to try a bit from the bowl and it was creamy, chock full of onion flavor with a perfect amount of smoky heat to finish in the back of the throat.  It's rich and highly recommended.  2.) Caesar Salad - This came in a large bowl and is easily enough to feed one person as an entree or four people as an appetizer.  Fresh romaine, grilled chicken, bacon, homemade croutons tossed in just the right amount of homemade caesar dressing.  Perfectly light and a good way to whet the appetite.  3.) Mac N' Cheese - This was probably the most popular dish at the restaurant as there were at least 2 orders each table.   The noodles are cooked in a light béchamel sauce that is slightly cheesy.  What takes this to the next level is the inclusion of maple smoked pork that is heaped on top.  Eaten together, the bite is a combo of creamy, cheesy, smoke and maple.  It's hard to describe but it's mouthwateringly good. Do not pass this up.    4.) 40 Day Aged Sirloin - Cooked to perfection with a red wine reduction sauce on a bed of cheesy polenta and accompanied by steamed brussel sprouts.  The steak is cooked perfectly and all the items accompany the meat in perfect harmony.  Can't go wrong.  5.) The Ultimate Experience - This is a large piece of smoked pork belly, crisped and braised to the point that barely any fat is left set upon a duo of pear and apple jam and celery puree.  Everything here works together.  It is insane.  This was singularly the best thing I ate here.  No photos because it was that good and I was too focused on eating this.  The staff recommended this as it takes their chefs 5 days to prepare this.  I don't have the words to properly describe how good this was but I strongly suggest at least one person order it for the table and share it like we did so everyone can get a taste.  Desserts - 1.) creme brûlée - good, 2.) vanilla cake in maple sauce - good but too sweet for my taste, 3.) cheesecake in a mason jar topped with mango jam - didn't try but my kids liked it  Service here is fantastic.  They treat you as one of their own family and will stop by not only to check on you but to chat.  They are constantly checking with one another about making sure that each diner is having their needs met.  I heard more than once them coordinating to fill a guest's wine glass if it stayed empty for more than a minute.  Portions are generous.  You should not leave hungry.  Did I mention that the prices here are incredibly reasonable for the food they serve?  They are far better and cheaper than all the restaurants a few blocks down in Old Montreal (most dishes are between $15 and $22 and the most expensive item topped out at $38 for a 12 oz sirloin).  There is a reason why a line forms outside about 30 minutes before they open.  When we left the line had doubled, and this was on a Tuesday.  My only gripe is that they open only for dinner on some days and brunch on others.  Given what we know about how they prepare their food however, I can understand.  If you're in Montreal, this is a must."}
{"text":"Must try the mac and cheese!!! Friendly service. Cute decor. Like everyone else say dont leave montreal without stopping by."}
{"text":"Excellent exquisite selections. The calamari was one of the best calamari dishes that I have ever had.  Server was the chef's sister and was extremely helpful. The place is small so there could be a wait to get in. We waited about 40 minutes in line."}
{"text":"My two friends and I arrived around 8:30 on Friday night and there was about two or three parties ahead of us. They don't have a wait list so you just wait in line until they seat you. We waited for about 30 minutes. Food was not bad. I got the pork belly. My friends got the cod and the brisket. I would've liked the pork belly skin to be crispier but you get a pretty decent sized portion. The pork itself wasn't anything out of this world but the sauces that come with it really add a unique flavor. I had a bite of the brisket too and admittedly it was a little dry. Though I didn't eat it with any of the gravy so that may have helped. The cod was really good. It melted like soft butter in your mouth. Portion didn't look too impressive but quality was there.  All in all, I enjoyed my experience but was a little let down by the quality of the food considering it's currently rated 5 stars. I think it's a solid four."}
{"text":"Fabulous find! Delicious and truly homemade food. Wonderful service. Small and may require a short wait but absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"US California review here!  What a great little dinner spot! The waitress was very chatty. She told us the place will be relocated with an actual kitchen with w a deep fryer. It's amazing what they can do without one right now! I will definitely look forward to the new spot and expanded menu when I return to Montreal.   The place is a good size. They have space to seat a party of 10 so if you have a big party, no worries. I would be safe and call first to see how busy they are.   Their menu is simple. One pager. Several appetizers and three main entrees. My wife and I skipped the appetizer and ordered their signature Mac N Cheese and their pork belly. This was way more than enough food for the two of us.   Their Mac N Cheese was good but I wasn't a fan of the sweet ham. Your taste buds may differ. The pork belly is a must try. It was so tender and delicious. We were very satisfied."}
{"text":"Came here after reading somewhere that the food has a comfort food feel to it. When I arrived, I definitely understood that aspect since the restaurant is family owned! The server is part of that family and honestly made half the experience! She's so energetic, interactive, and welcoming!  I read about their mac and cheese and the pork belly and still didn't know which to order when I was sat down. Luckily, since I was dining alone, I was able to try half and half of each! I was also torn between a couple beers and the server helped me make a decision on that also!  The mac and cheese really hit the spot, especially with the amount of truffle flavor in it. The ham on top went really well with the cheesiness of the mac and cheese. The pork belly had a crispy skin, tender meat, but fat that melted in my mouth. It went really well with the apricot and truffle puree that surrounded it. Ended with the pouding chomeur which tasted like a really moist pancake but in actual cake form.  The location is really close to Old Montreal but they're going to move in a couple months, just a couple blocks away. Overall, would recommend coming to Le Robin Square when you're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would!  I looked for a restaurant that served Canadian food and was near the hotel because we had walked all day and I didn't want to go far.  Robin Square was highly rated but the thing that scared me was that it was Friday night and reading the other reviews, small dining room, long wait.  But we took a gamble, and when we walked up there were 4 girls waiting.  Me: Have you been waiting long? She: About five minutes, but tables of two don't wait as long so you might get a table now. Me: I'm sorry She: No you're not...(laughing)  I went in and was warmly greeted and told it would probably be 20 minutes.  She: How long did she say? Me: 20 minutes Other she: Do you still feel sorry? Me: Yes, cause I've read the food's good here and don't want to go in before you. Other she: No you don't! (more laughter)  The wait wasn't that long.  We were given a two top in the center of the restaurant.  Yes, the table are close together, but have you ever eaten at a restaurant in New York City?  Tables there are practically on top of each other, so this was nothing new.  Our server was excited that it was our first time and that we were from out of town, she asked questions about California and New York City.  The menu is small.  They tend to change a few items depending on availability of food.  We shared the caesar salad with chicken, which we probably could've shared with the table next to us...LOL!  The chicken was moist and tender and the light dressing was perfect.  Some restaurants tend to over dress their caesars.  We decided to share two of their popular dishes.  The grilled pork belly was well seasoned, tender with an excellent crispy top.  But it was the the mac n cheese that we both fell in love with.  I always compare mac n cheeses to Cafe Chloe's in San Diego, R square's is right there with them.  The most delicious cheese sauce topped with tender ham which has a maple sweetness and all the flavors work so well together.  Creme brulee to top of the evening and we were happy fatties!  We tried to come back for that mac n cheese, but they are closed on Sundays and Mondays....How dare they!!!!  Definitely worth coming to, and a place I can't wait to come back to on the next visit.  No reservations.  Waiting only.  For a place so small, it's not that noisy.  They even had a \"fire\" burning for ambiance...LOL! Two tops have a better chance than big parties."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. You should stop reading this review now and just head down to Le Robin Square right now...   ...Okay, if you're still reading I'm happy to share my experience - which is going to sounds like alot if the other reviews on here.   They've got the full package going on here, starting with their story and service.  Our incredibly friendly server let us know right off the bat that they were a family operation (her sister was waiting on another table, her brother in the kitchen, and her mother baked the bread we were about to enjoy), and that they sourced much of their ingredients locally.  It's a great bit of background that makes you feel instantly at home and look forward to enjoying an ethically sourced meal prepared with a lot of love by a family of restaurateurs.   Of course, without great food, a great restaurant story is just buildup that lets you down when the meal comes to the table.  When the plates came (and oh so quickly!) At Le Robin Square, it was immediately apparent that we would not be disappointed. This was one if the most delicious meals I have ever had from start to finish - the kind where you consciously overeat because you can't imagine letting any delicious scrap go to waste.   I won't go into detail about the dishes because they've been thoroughly described in many reviews on this site already(we got the Mac and Cheese and Ultimate Experience), but I will share an anecdote that assured me the chef knows exactly what he is doing and puts great care into the menu. I was asked if I wanted some house-made hot sauce for the Mac & Cheese, and of course said yes. It came to the table before the main course, so my girlfriend and I sampled it for flavor while we waited. Our first impression was that it was incredibly hot - I could not imagine applying much if it to the meal without it overpowering the dish. When I did get a chance to try them together, I was absolutely blown away - the sweet, maple-infused creaminess of the Mac & Cheese perfectly balanced the heat of the hot sauce, adding a bit of tang and fire while in no way compromising or detracting from the flavor.   I realized that when I was asked if I wanted hot sauce for the Mac & Cheese, it meant I would be receiving a sauce specially designed to accompany the dish. It's this sort of attention to detail in the flavors that elevates Le Robin Square from a good, adorable, locally sourced, family restaurant to a truly great restaurant - no additional qualifiers needed."}
{"text":"We had the Mac and cheese, pork belly and pizza. I am disappointed given the high rating at Yelp. The pork belly was underwhelming considering the server told us it took five days to prepare. I would expect it to be more tender and flavorful. The Mac and cheese - only thing I can say it's big portion. The pizza is the best out of the three. Overall it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. I got the burrata on pizza and my fiancé got the cod - both were delicious! And the dessert (cheese cake and apple tart) was so good and I don't usually like cheesecake. The waitstaff (which includes the owner) were so friendly and attentive. And seriously omg the food. So fresh and so filling but not overwhelming."}
{"text":"Such a cute and intimate spot. Small menu but every dish was amazing. The steak with polenta and pea puree was out of this world."}
{"text":"Wow.  This place is amazing.  We went last weekend while in Montreal for a road trip and I am so happy we did.  The staff, all family, are very kind and gracious.  We had a goat cheese tart starter that I still think about.  It was so yummy.  Then we both had mac & cheese, mine w/o ham while my friend had the full meal.  It was excellent.  I wish I had room for dessert.  Or that it wasn't a 5 1/2 hour drive so I could go again."}
{"text":"Small menue, quaint decor in this family run resto....but oh my goodness....the food.....absolutely  everything was top notch. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"This was the best meal we had in Montreal.  The mac and cheese with ham was phenomenal.  It's served with their house made hot sauce and I wish they bottled and sold that.  We also loved the burrata pizza.  They have a limited menu but my sense is what they do serve, they serve very well.  They also have local beers available via bottle."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing! Delicious cocktails and food paired with great service!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem while looking for an authentic lunch near the Basilica. Our waitress is the chefs daughter and told us how it was a family run shop and all vegetables are from their garden. You could tell the place and heart and soul. The food did not disappoint. I had their quiche of the day which had melted Brie on top while my fiancé had their Cesar salad. The microbrewery they stock was also great. If you ask for what to do around Montreal you can get a special list!"}
{"text":"Arrived in Old Montreal and checked Yelp for a place to eat lunch.  The 5 star reviews of Robin Square are right on target.  Family run by sisters.  Mom bakes the bread at 4 in the morning! This is true Canadian farm to table, comfort food type of place. Quirky and quaint. The Mac and Cheeze with glazed ham was decadent and the Grilled Cheese on homemade sourdough was a delight.  Salad dressed perfectly.  Service was friendly and warm. Felt like you were guests at their home."}
{"text":"excellent place to try cuisine quebecoise while staying downtown for business!  very hospitable staff, especially considering this is in the business district.  recommend everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin. First, the operation is family owned and operated and they are the best people I have ever met. Service is fast and so friendly. They make you feel at home! It is a small restaurant but they got me in quickly and they offer wine or beer while you wait which I highly recommend. Great selection of both.  The food is AMAZING! Le Robin Square was recommended to me by a friend who came a few weeks earlier for a different conference. She told me to have the Mac and cheese (which is in this rich and sweet roasted garlic cream sauce) and has the most tender sweet spare rib meat piled on top. Then I also was told I had to have the pork belly. The portions huge here as well and is also sweet smoked and braised. It comes with an apricot purée and a celery root and truffle purée with a shallot and maple syrup sauce! Need I saw more. It was too much food for me and I can EAT BUT I had only this me night left and I had to do it.   If that wasn't enough I had to try a dessert of course! The one that caught my attention that my friend forgot to mention was this rich spongy cake with maple cream. A true way to end not only a Canadian visit but the best Montréal has to offer. Please come and pay a visit to Sylvia and her brother and sister working hard to make a fabulous food experience for locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've ever been to! It was super busy during lunch but the waitress was very friendly and welcoming and told us to come back in 20 minutes when a table cleared up. We did and she was very helpful with the menu. Ordered the mac and cheese with ham, spinach cream soup, and grilled cheese. Everything was incredible, one of the best meals I've had here and the staff is so kind and welcoming. Don't even think about missing this place!"}
{"text":"Whoa...french food, atmosphere, wine, comfort and the smell..ohhh the smell of the French cuisine..family owned too! It was all delicious and presentation was on point"}
{"text":"I came here around the end of August for dinner, and I've been putting off writing this review because I've had some mixed feelings about Le Robin Square.  =Location & Ambience Located in Old Town, it's close to many of the major tourist attractions in Montreal. The vibe inside is intimately kooky. There's a TV screen displaying a crackling fireplace, woven chandeliers, and funky zebra print wallpaper.  =Food My sister and I ordered the truffle mac and cheese and the pork belly to share. Unfortunately, both dishes left much to be desired.  The macaroni itself was cooked a bit firmer than to my likening, but the ham was tender, and I appreciated that the dish had a strong truffle flavor, as advertised. Somehow, though, the mac & cheese was too sweet.  The same could be said for the pork belly dish. While the celery root puree hit the spot, the pear & apricot jam, and maple syrup concoctions were also too sweet. The homemade bread made fresh by the chef's mother was rustic and yummy, but it felt like a random addition to the plate.  I get the whole concept of savory & sweet, but the sweetness was overpowering. There doesn't need to be 2 dishes that play the \"savory & sweet\" game on the menu. Coming from a place of respect, I truly believe the chef can be more creative than that, especially if the menu items come at a hefty price.  Perhaps Le Robin Square had just temporarily lost sight of its true strengths. I took a peek at their past menu offerings, and the guinea fowl and smoked salmon dishes seemed to be a better representation of cuisine that's quintessentially Quebecois. Food worth flying thousands of miles for!  =Service Service was great in that everyone seemed to truly enjoy working there. It's a family affair in there, and they treat you like welcomed guests.  =Other Notes They don't take reservations, and you can't put your name down. You just wait in line, first come first serve.  Overall, the food fell a bit short of our expectations but the service made up for it...a little. However, I feel Le Robin Square has a lot of potential and if they're able to further refine their dishes and overall menu offering, they will be exponentially successful.  3.75"}
{"text":"So if rating based solely on the food I would probably give this place 5 stars. However, other aspects of the experience were less than ideal. First of all the system for waiting for a table seems silly. The restaurant is very small and cramped and they don't take names so this results in a line beginning in the tiny vestibule of the entrance and coming out onto the sidewalk so you end up spending 30 minutes to an hour holding a door open. I imagine this is not a new issue and similarly busy/popular restaurants that don't take reservations have come up with better solutions. We were seated upstairs at a high top in the corner. My chair was broken  so that the bar for your feet to rest was broken and while my fiancé and I were noticing it, the waitress acknowledged it and laughed saying that she had noticed it earlier but did not offer another chair or even just an appropriate apology. It was uncomfortably warm likely due to heat rising from the kitchen in combination with a warm August day. We ordered the mac and cheese with ham and hot sauce and the pork belly. Both were delicious and large portions so I would say it was a good value. During dinner I noticed a fly in my nearly full glass of wine and when I alerted the waitress she seemed annoyed with me and returned nearly 10 minutes later with a new half glass of wine which was less than was in my glass originally. There was again no apology. The payment system is that you have to go downstairs and pay at the counter which seems like another strange policy for a place that is so tiny and cramped and seemingly trying to create a nice ambience. Probably would not return despite the delicious food due to a poor experience overall."}
{"text":"Pros: huge portions, reasonably priced tasty food, all local fare, family run business, great service, attentive waiter, clean.   Cons: tables are too close together, they ran out of ice while we were there, too warm inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"This was best restaurant we ate at in Montreal, I couldn't believe how good the mac and cheese is.  JUST ORDER IT!, I don't usually order mac and cheese anywhere but I swear to you this is different, there is real cheese in it that makes it 10 times better than any dish I had on my trip, if you haven't ordered it yet, what are you waiting for...."}
{"text":"Well...I figured 130+ 5 star reviews must mean something!  They do.  Just get here...and be prepared to wait....no reservations and it's packed the moment they open the door.  I was part of the morning's pre opening line up.  Everything is homemade and farm to table....place is family owned and it shows.  Food is ridiculous ...comfort food like you've never had.  The grilled cheese is outstanding and that tomato soup was spot on.  The mango jam for dipping would taste good on my shoe.  The pudding chameur i stuffed in for dessert was amazing too.  Get in line and just think about the meal you're about to have!"}
{"text":"This place is nuts !!! The food the people all awesome ...the Mac and cheese is a creation unlike any other Mac and cheese you've had ... We had 2 specials for dinner one cod with cream sauce and one pork belly with sauces all around it .. I can tell you this food was real real great .. The staff is so nice and polite from the wait staff to the cashier all very dedicated good workers.. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars was because of the comfort level .. We sat on a shaken table with folding chairs ...are you kidding me ? You guys have lines out the door making money hand over fist..GET SOME REAL CHAIRS !!!!!!!!!!!!! My meal 2 specials , 1 app and a glass of wine cost 100 dollars with tip ...worth the money 100% .. Go here but sit downstairs upstairs is very uncomfortable ..."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled. Bad reviews are only for those who are trying to avoid the long lines here by scaring people off. This place is worth a trip to Montreal! The Mac 'n Cheese and The Ultimate Experience (crispy pork belly) were so delicious, we didn't want it to end! The desserts and bread were to die for and the family kept coming around to make sure we were well cared for. It was like having dinner with friends. Such an amazing experience and well worth every penny and any wait.   Who doesn't love Home cooking when they travel. So good!"}
{"text":"What a great dining experience at Le Robin Square! We lucked out and was able to get a table for 7 as a walk in.  Attentive staff and great food! Mac and cheese was adelicious hit!  This restaurant was definitely the highlight of our trip and we wanted to go again the last night we were in Montréal but they're closed on Mondays! :(   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ate here on our first day. It is tiny but so worth the visit. Staff was very courteous and warm with just the right level of attentiveness.  My server let me taste the wine I was ordering first which was refreshing.  Our soup du jour was excellent. There was bread, I think, it was so good we gobbled it up!  We realized, after our food arrived that we preferred the others main course so we switched. I ended up with the delicious Mac and cheese with ham that was more like sweet pork tenderloin. My associate had the quiche and was very happy with it.  We were too full for dessert but wish we had room. They all sounded very tasty.  What shines here is the staff. Food can be average to excellent anywhere but it is the folks who are professional and friendly that make you want to return. We will!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to come to this place based on the amazing reviews on Yelp. Do not trust Yelp in Montreal! We came here with our 6 month old and the lady made us carry the stroller up the stairs to second floor because she couldn't have us seat at a table of 4 downstairs. After sitting down we realized that the AC upstairs wasn't working. They sat us in a tiny table for two against the wall and it was scorching hot. We ordered the Mac and cheese and pork belly recommended by the server. What a disappointment! The pork belly was very fatty, undercooked and hard. The Mac and cheese has truffle oil but was salty. Food was very mediocre, service was terrible and ambiance was not charming at all. Do not come here. You will be very disappointed."}
{"text":"On vacay, looking for family friendly place, with great food and found Robin Square on Yelp. This was the best meal of the trip!  Small menu, but don't be concerned - it's all good. Also, the service and family who runs the place are delightful. Go early, to avoid the wait.   Small - Quaint - Delicious!"}
{"text":"Added a star for the service.  Searching on Yelp and FB, I was really excited to try this restaurant as I would like to have some local food in Montreal and with all the good reviews.   The waitress was friendly and explained the dishes in details. I added an extra star to be fair because she did mention that the Mac and Cheese was on the sweet side. However, we didn't expect it to be SO sweet.  We ordered the buttersquash soup, the ultimate experience (pork belly), and the Mac and Cheese.  Buttersquash soup: 3.5/5 Nice and creamy, but the salt wasn't seasoned evenly. We had one spoon that has no taste and one spoon that's too salty before we stirred it.  Mac and Cheese: 2/5 Again, toooo creamy and sweet. I can see that a lot of people have this dish leftover on their table because it's too rich. I think it might be better at an appetizer size, especially when there's nothing refreshing on the menu to balance the flavor.   Pork Belly: 3/5 I like the crispiness of the pork. However, it doesn't taste up to the description of 5 day worth of work. It taste nice and special, but was not amazed. Again, all the sauces were on the sweet side and there was nothing to balance the taste  It's a nice experience, but probably wouldn't recommend to anyone or visit it again."}
{"text":"Nice, family owned business. They focused on hospitality when I was there. Very friendly and I felt welcome when I was there.  Wines and microbrews from the region got me hooked on this place. And their menu isn't that bad either. I had the Ultimate Experience, since it was my first time there and it was rich, fatty, and made my trek here from downtown Montreal worthwhile.  I'll be back to try their other popular menu items."}
{"text":"Despite the lack of seating and the ambiance of this place it is a very cozy privately owned restaurant with the sweetest staff and fantastic food. If your looking for a cute date place with nothing but good vibes this is the right place."}
{"text":"If you can, get here early. We left around noon and it was almost packed and was still packed when we walked by later that night. The food is excellent and as an added bonus, it's a family-owned restaurant, so you're also supporting small business.  This small café is located near the courthouse and you can almost miss it if you're walking down the street, but just look for the giant red R on the window and you're good to go.  The food was excellent. She had the quiche and I had the redneck grilled cheese, which was gigantic and made of BBQ pulled pork and cheese. It was served on a piece of wood, which was cool. It had an excellent flavor, just spicy enough, that could compete with the best BBQ places in the U.S. - a surprise find in French-speaking Montreal. The quiche was also good, just the right amount of seasonings. I think we both ate everything on our plates, or in my case, the log."}
{"text":"The onion soup was unreal. Very creamy, a beautiful mix of spice I was extremely impressed. Ordered the Ultimate Experience pork belly and I had no words to speak until I finished it all. Bravo Chef. Utterly the best tasting pork belly I have ever had. Extremely friendly staff, would absolutely go back again. Well done to all and thank you for such a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"This place is cool. It looks like what you're young chef friend would put together. There was a line when we got there, this seemed typical based on signage. I would say be patient, the waitstaff are in no hurry and are friendly. The food was interesting and everything we had was worth getting again. The pork belly was as nice as it looked. The risotto was surprisingly underdone but tasty if a little crunchy. The calamari was really different. The waitress indicated it was poached for 5 hours. The texture was something completely different from your average calamari; not at all tough or chewy. Definitely the best of that ingredient I've ever had. All in all a pretty unique place"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing.   From the minute you walk into the door you are immediately greeted with an awesome vibe, the smell of deliciousness, and a service that is unheard of.    I absolutely adore the quaint atmosphere where you absorb the positive energy.   The food is outstanding.  Everything we ordered, the flavors were technically mastered to have a hint of intensity and subtle to different areas of your palate.   And the service was like you wanted to be their best friend or family member.   Awesome awesome job!!!"}
{"text":"This elegant restaurant in Vieux-Montréal is an excellent, high-class (and pricey) choice for a fancy night out.  When I first saw Le Robin Square, I originally mistook it as some sort of luxury hotel. From the outside, the first thing I noticed through the windows were the huge chandeliers and the stylish furniture. When you walk inside, you'll instantly fall in love with the ambiance: it's sophisticated, bright, and comfortable. The staff is all extremely friendly and they treat you like royalty. Because it's quite popular, it's difficult to get a table without a reservation, but fortunately I came early enough in the evening.  The menu is relatively small, and it changes often, so you know the chef (who's also the owner) has carefully curated each option. I got \"The Ultimate Experience,\" which was a huge slab of braised pork belly. It was tender and delicious (and fatty!). I also ordered the seasonal vegetables, which turned out to be roasted beets, Brussels sprouts, and broccoli - these were also amazing.  Overall, I had a lovely time here. The food was good, but to be honest, you can get good food at a lot of places in Montréal - the true allure of Le Robin Square is the ambiance and the experience. Come here for a special occasion (or just to treat yo' self), and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was everything you could hope for! The ambience, the food, the service were all amazing and on point.  We ordered the mac and cheese and a dish called \"dead and alive\" which had salmon, potato, caviar and an egg and two side dishes (one of mushrooms, the other of veggies). All were absolutely decadent and everything I could have hoped for. My friends and I devoured anything and already want to go back.  The restaurant itself is super homey and rustic-feeling. The service was also amazing and our waiter was super nice."}
{"text":"The mac and cheese. That is all.  Came here about 15 minutes after opening for dinner on Canada Day. Ended up waiting about an hour or so. WORTH IT. Plus, the owner Sylvia Robin comes out to check on you and give the option to order drinks and pre-order while you wait. Only gripe is they don't necessarily go in order when they seat you, it's more about accommodating people to seats (which makes sense, but selfish me was sad when they took a party of four behind us before us).  Food: I can only write about the Mac n Cheese, as that is what we split. The macaroni is so creamy, cooked perfectly al dente. The christmas honey ham is so easy to tear with your fork, and the combination of the truffle oil, macaroni, cream, and honey ham is the most enjoyable combination of flavors. It's truly an experience and something that is difficult to put into words. Adding the house made hot sauce gives it an additional kick. This dish is $20 something and change but it is wholly, wholly worth trying. Trust me on this one. It is definitely a dish that is on my list of top ten most delicious things I have ever had.   Service: Quick, friendly, homely feel to it.  I will definitely come again and will order the mac and cheese for myself because no new friends."}
{"text":"We made a last minute trip to Montreal and didn't do much planning ahead. Our regular spot had closed for the season so we turned to Yelp for advice. Since we were staying in Old Montreal just a block away, Le Robin Square came up. Outside as we were looking over the menu, a local stopped to tell us that he had heard great things about the place and plans to try it himself soon.  Upon walking in, you get a good feel for the people who own the restaurant based on the fun decor and music. The staff was extremely friendly. It was Halloween weekend, so naturally the Chef had on a superman/girl-cape-hat- one that would flap in the wind as we watched him zig zag back and forth in the tiny-but-powerful-kitchen. The restaurant definitely felt young, eclectic and energetic- we had a *really* long, tiring day and we weren't sure we were up for it. But within seconds the hostess greeted us cheerfully and seated us right away.  The hostess turned out to be one half of the owners, Sylvia. She was very friendly and absolutely brightened up our day and our entire dinner experience. She started this venture with her younger brother, Chef Red, when they were barely adults (he was 21!). It's incredible to see where they are now- the talent, the passion, and the happiness. I really think it was kismet that day for us to walk into their restaurant, it was the boost of positivity that we both needed. (Side note: the awe-inspiring larger-than-life Prince and Bowie portraits were created by one of their other brilliant sisters)  The menu is limited to just a few appetizer and entree options, which shows that they know what they are selective and focused on perfecting what they are good at. I really appreciate a clean, precise menu because we both have trouble making decisions on food. Sylvia was extremely passionate as she explain to us our options, which helped us decide what we wanted. If the Chef can take 3 days to prepare for a dish, count us in! Also, the homemade hot sauce sold me.  We started with the soup of the day, which was a butternut squash cream soup. It was light and full at the same time with a beautiful creamy consistency. The bf damn near licked the bowl clean!  I ordered 'the ultimate experience'- brined, smoked, and braised Nagano pork belly (100% Quebec meat developed for Japanese cooks), truffle celery-root puree, pear and apricot jam, wine and maple syrup albufera sauce. I have to tip my hat to this dish - the pork belly literally melted in my mouth. The sauces were unique and you could really tasted each flavor. I couldn't finish the entire thing, so I took it home and ate the rest for breakfast, don't judge me. #noshame  The bf ordered the 'our incredible mac&cheese' - Chef Red's Christmas ham, Roasted garlic infused cream, swiss cheese, cream cheese, black truffle oil. This is apparently the ham that this awesome brother-sister duo ate growing up during the holidays. It's the details like this that show how much love these two put into this restaurant. The mac&cheese was perfectly cooked (I like it al dente or close to. Who likes soggy pasta?) and the sauce was the perfect blend of cheese as far as flavor and a lovely creamy consistency. We shared an order of their side for the day, scalloped potatoes (the bf's favorite).  The apple crumble (*drool*) with a chocolate shot in the middle (OMG) was the metaphorical cherry on top. It was a good size to share, with the perfect amount of sweetness to round off our dinner.  I really can't express how much passion and love shows through when you sit down here and pay attention. What was suppose to be a quick dinner to close off our very long and tiring day, ended up being a fantastic, delicious, and fun 3 (3.5?) hour experience (we basically stayed til closing I think). We will definitely be looking forward to coming back on our next trip. Excellent food and company, what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"A family owned institution! Staff and food here was outstanding. All meals are delicious here. Worth the wait which you will encounter. Come early or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"This is one of the best meals that I ever had. I am food snob that's hard to please so I don't make this statement lightly. I had the pork belly and Mac and Cheese. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Superb dinner. Mac and cheese with braised pork 5. Get the habanero hot sauce on the side. Mango me cocktails on point."}
{"text":"Got the Mac n' Cheese.  Ridged elbow macaroni topped with ham and light garnish.  This is a dish of intense truffle, cheese, and maple flavors. The flavor profile of this first hits with the floryness of the pasta, then you get notes of funky (in a good way) cheesiness, followed by a blend of maple and truffle aftertaste. These flavor are strong and do challenge pallettes unaccustomed to intensity, especially with truffles.  The plate is topped with ham. The best ham I've ever had. It's amazingly tender and hold it's smoky sweetness so well.  The sauce is smooth and strong.  My single qualm with this dish is with the doneness of the pasta. The elbow macaronis were slightly too chewy for me. The bite still felt like the pasta needed about 3-5 more minutes in boiling water. Execution of the pasta make a big difference in the overall quality of the dish. It's one of those things where I didn't want to be a snob and send the dish back, but the pasta was very clearly underdone.  This is a shame, too, because the rest of the dish was so good."}
{"text":"Great lunch or casual dinner spot! Huuuuge portions, great food!"}
{"text":"Christmas Eve dinner without reservations for 2  We arrived early (before the doors were open!) and waited in line to get in. Service was attentive and friendly - they took the time and effort to explain the reason behind the restaurants name and for each dish - things you'd need to look out for etc. (eg Mac and cheese has a sweetness to It because of the pork)   We shared :  Starter - foie gras  Great toasted gingerybread to complement the foie gras.   Mains - Mac and cheese and ultimate experience  I wouldn't order the Mac and cheese again because It was way too sweet for our liking. It was a great Quebecois take on the dish. The pasta was al dente enough but we prefer the dish traditional, cheesy, gooey, bechamel and all  Pork skin was a little dark (burnt) to the eyes but didn't taste that way. The 3 accompanying sauces were good complements. Since we shared, It wasn't too cloying like other reviews mentioned.  We overheard practically every table ordering these 2 dishes.  Tables filled up within 30 mins of their opening for the evening though It was freezing out!   Great job!"}
{"text":"Amazing meal.  Service was wonderful - everyone was helpful, friendly and explained all the food to us in detail.  We had the steak, the mac & cheese topped with brisket and the pork belly.  All were prepared perfectly.  Great ambiance, would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves food!"}
{"text":"No way to describe how great the overall experience was.    The waitress the sister of the chef was the prefect hostess friendly right of the bat.  always smiling and attentive.  now for the food.  mac and cheese not like any mac and cheese i have ever eaten, creamy  not cheesely with a little bit of salty pull pork and hot sauce.  prefect starter.  Pork belly, holy crap so many textures and tastes.  maple sauce, apple tasting sauce  and white cream sauce.  than you have the prefect crispy pork belly skin and melting pork belly.  the food sales itself but the friendly service made me want to go back the next day."}
{"text":"Due to a flight cancellation, it allowed us time to venture to this spot. It was on a Tuesday night, luckily there was no line. Just a short 2-3 minute wait. Came for the pork belly and left with a full one.  Service, food, vibe was all awesome. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Perfect food, location and waitress/owner.   Visited this place based on 5 star reviews and it did not disappoint. Went with the Mac and Cheese to start (and what meal can go wrong with that start). To be completely honest, it was too sweet for my taste. The Ham \"garnish\" was too Christmas-ey with cloves, honey, etc. I feared the meal was going to not live up to expectations. But, in comes the previously mentioned waitress/owner with a smoky Jalepeño chimichurri that saved the day. Completely transformed the sweetness into a smoky spicy masterpiece.   Dinner was the ricotta gnocchi (made by her mother) with chipotle chicken, and pineapple chutney. Hands down best dish I have had in a year.   No desert tonight, but would love to go back and tear into it. No doubt it would be amazing."}
{"text":"As per other reviews on yelp we decided to check this place out. The food was as fantastic as others have described. The mac and cheese was delicious, it had so many different elements to it and therefore it was not boring! The pork belly I only had one bite of as my husband did not want to share. He devoured it. According to him, pork belly is difficult to get right and they got it right. Our 8 month old daughter was with us and she is an extremely picky eater. Having noticed purees on the menu (as an accompaniment to menu entrees), we asked if they had any which would be suitable for a baby. The chef whipped up a sweet potato and carrot puree. My daughter is very picky, but she happily ate it! I tried some too, it was delicious! Staff was friendly and eager to share the family story behind the restaurant. We did not have dessert as we were pretty sugared out from the day in old Montreal (so many sweet dishes everywhere!). We sat on the main floor next to the window where it felt a little drafty. The restaurant was pretty empty looking for a friday evening. Perhaps we were just there for an early dinner or it was just the day of the week. Overall I would recommend this restaurant and would go back.  Stroller tip - the main floor of the restaurant is stroller friendly. It is a bit tight but the staff are very accommodating. There are no steps to get into the restaurant"}
{"text":"Wow... This funky, family-owned and run place is outstanding. The service is friendly and they really seem to care about their atmosphere and product. Small place with a great vibe and terrific food. We had everything from the foie-gras to asparagus soup to macaroni & cheese to pork belly... all was top notch. The light club music (a dance mix of \"Sexual Healing\"?!?), the portrait of David Bowie, and the wonderful service... Go."}
{"text":"This cute family business is perfect for dinner and desserts. Even some seemingly simple dishes are prepared with thoughtfulness. We ordered a foie gras appetizer that came with thin slices of ginger bread and marmalade. The richness was well balanced with the ginger and citrus flavors. The pork belly entree was perfect with the slightly sweet sauce. Dessert was also very special. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while visiting Old Montreal. They do not take reservations so go early if you can. The restaurant is small with long lines but definitely worth the wait. Simply delicious!!! We ordered the Mac-n-Cheese,the Ultimate Experience (pork belly), and Jalapeño Soup."}
{"text":"one of my rare 5 star reviews!  the food was amazing, my table all tried each others dishes, so I tried the pork belly, mac 'n cheese, and beet salad. the pork belly was AMAZING! very very fatty (which is good for pork belly), flavourful, and filling.  The mac 'n cheese was extremely filling as well, very creamy and tasted real. there seemed to be a hint of alcohol which was surprising but nice. the beet salad was also good but I'm not a fan of beets   The service was on point, there was one waitress the whole night (I'm guessing Robin, forget her name) who attended to everyone and was nice and cordial!   the atmosphere was super cute, it's a very small, quaint, and cosy place that's perfect for a date. someone in my group complained that the music was too loud, but I thought it was  actually at a perfect volume. it can be hard to get a spot if you're a large group or you go on a busy night, so plan accordingly!  Food was obviously expensive (roughly $25-$30 a person), but it was worth it!  food: 9.5 service: 10 atmosphere: 9.5"}
{"text":"Truly impressed with the entire experience here. We came here twice because we loved it so much! The food was truly unique. The ingredients, preparation, and menu are so well thought out. The menu changes from lunch to dinner, but the ever so popular Mac & Cheese with Ham is a constant. Its family-run business with a very welcoming feel. Every aspect of the dinning experience was given such great detail here. So pleased with everything we ate here. Sylvia, who also is one of the chefs/cooks,\" hosts\" the room throughout dinner. She is so honest, friendly, and inviting :)"}
{"text":"Food was good but not wow. Staff was friendly. Place is small. Feels like a lunch counter and not a resto. Menu is very limited (5 items). Was looking forward to coming here but disappointed to see that this is just another hyped up social media darling without substance."}
{"text":"This was our first food stop on our Montréal trip and we were not disappointed! The restaurant has a very elegant classy vibe and their decor is so cute!   Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu. We got the burrata to start, as we wanted something more refreshing since it was so hot out. What a beaut! I'm so used to having burrata served with tomato's and pesto that I was so in awe when this dish as served to us. And it was delicious too.   For the main course, we got the Ultimate Experience (pork belly) and the Mac n Cheese remix with brisket. The pork belly was so good and melt in your mouth. The Mac n Cheese was probably the best I've ever had, but in comparison, I liked it less than the pork belly. It wasn't too cheesy, so if you're someone who likes your Mac n cheese smothered in cheese, this dish will probably be disappointing to you. However, I liked that there wasn't that much cheese on it. One thing I disliked about the Mac n cheese is that there was big salt flakes on it and it felt strange every time I bit the salt- kinda like I had eaten sand. It definitely ruined the experience for me a little bit.   The portions are quite generous which is always good. I ended up not being able to finish the Mac n cheese because there was so much food.   Overall, good food, good service. It's location is also in a very touristy part of town so very convenient if you're visiting!"}
{"text":"This place deserves six stars. This was some of the best food I've ever had, anywhere. The smoked pork belly \"The Ultimate Experience\" is, as they say, to die for. Sorry we didn't try the Mac and Cheese. The only down note here was the Chicken Caesar salad was completely unremarkable - like what you'd get at a neighborhood diner.  A couple of items on the menu weren't available, which is what you'd expect if they are serving locally sourced food and being discriminating about what they buy and serve, so that fact actually gave me more confidence in them."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!! Everything is farm-fresh and homemade!!  Have the mango jam!!!!  Highly recommend here!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant.  The food was perfectly prepared and the service was excellent.  Also, the prices were quite reasonable for the amount and quality of food. This is now one of my favorite Montreal restaurants and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing family owned restaurant. You can tell everything is made with love. A bit pricey but great if you want to spoil yourself"}
{"text":"The Best Restaurant in Montreal!!!!   Sister (Owner and Beautiful) and Brother (Chef) team, who has it all figured out!!  They are full of life and their food shows it!!  Love, love , love   Pork Belly was the best I ever had and I'm a Pit Master from the Carolinas!!! (Traditions BBQ Inc. ) The steak and peppercorn sauce are delicious as well!!  Don't miss the beet salad and homemade desserts!  Robins family made us feel like family!! I Absolutely Love and understand the small family concept!!  If you have time for just one restaurant, GO HERE!!!                (Often imitated never duplicated)"}
{"text":"Delicious family run small restaurant by Old Montreal. We stopped in at around 830 pm on a Tuesday night, had to wait about 5 minutes. We had our baby with us and we found the restaurant family friendly (they provided plastic plate and cup for her -- we were running on Alberta time, she's normally not up that late! But I digress...)   Love the local craft beer selection.   We ordered the burrata pizza, Mac and cheese and the calamari with saffron risotto. The mac and cheese was our favorite and I will be craving it for months now! There is \"ham\" on top but it's more of a pulled pork texture in a sweet sauce that goes amazing with the Mac and cheese which is good enough to be served on its own. The burrata pizza was served with a generous portion of burrata (so much so I cut away about half per slice) and it was delicious. The calamari were perfectly cooked and the risotto was like if jambalaya and paella were to have an unique and delicious baby.   Service was quick, waitresses were friendly. Small but interesting and delicious menu and I hope we get to go back sometime!"}
{"text":"My first morning in Montreal didn't start too well due to certain circumstances, but come night time for dinner I have to say Sylvia absolutely made up for the bad start we had for my friends and I.We ordered the whole menu, and let me say there is no exaggeration when i say everything on the menu was fantastic. Not only is is the food super good and homey, It's like you're not even at a restaurant but at a friend's house enjoy a nice home cooked meal with Sylvia as the best Host ever. So Thank You Sylvia for making an unforgettable memory for us! If I am ever back in Montreal in the future I will be sure to stop by again!"}
{"text":"Great food with wonderful, playful twists. Amazingly nice, friendly staff. We had the Mac cheese and pork belly. Both delicious - just know that the pork is just the meat and puree. Interesting selection of local beers. Fun atmosphere. Our waitress was just the right amount of over the top bubbly quirky conversational. They take love of eating seriously."}
{"text":"I'm still thinking about the mac and cheese months after eating here. It's that good. I was very skeptical after hearing that it was sweet, which frankly sounded disgusting to me, but how could so many Yelpers be wrong? Well, the maple sweetness is actually offset quite nicely by the crunchy Himalayan salt and the smoky earthiness of the truffle oil. Truly a beautiful synthesis.   We also had the pork belly, which was delicious and enormous. I am no wilting flower but it was honestly too rich for me. Actually, it was the richest thing I've probably ever eaten, and that's saying a lot! I would have been happy to split the dish between, say, four or five people.   We got there 30 minutes before they opened and were first in line. The place is pretty unassuming so I thought we were at the wrong restaurant at first. I'm very glad we arrived early because a line developed that went all the way to the end of the block by the time we were allowed in. Folks who didn't make the first seating had to wait another hour. Almost everyone we overheard was a tourist.  Décor was nothing special and did not align with the price point. Dining chairs were metal patio furniture. The room itself was awkwardly laid out and a bit cramped.   Service was very friendly but very efficient. This is a well oiled machine and I would not say the overall dining experience was particularly relaxing, it was akin to being on a conveyor belt. After tasting the mac and cheese, I didn't care about any of these negative factors, though, and would have happily dined in a gas station to get my hands on it."}
{"text":"My husband wanted us to leave when he saw the small limited menu but I convinced him to stay and give it a shot. Boy are we ever happy we stayed. This had to be one of the best dinners we have had in a long long time. The quality of the food is insane. We ordered the pork belly dish and the guineafowl dish with homemade gnocchi. If I had to pick between the two I'd go with the pork belly, just melted in your mouth, but both dishes were fantastic. The homemade herbed gnocchi was also a hit with a firmer and more chewy texture. We had the creme brûlée and the maple cake desserts and both were amazing. I also enjoyed a full bodied Spanish wine, although I can't remember the name of it. Overall wonderful dining experience. You can tell the restaurant uses fresh, local ingredients and the chef knows what he's doing. Totally worth the price tag. If you are in Montreal, don't miss this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm waiting for the day i get to go back to Montreal and eat their Mac n Cheese. I came here with a group of people and we had such a tough time deciding what to get (from the menu of 5-6 options).   Most of us were deciding between the mac n cheese and pork belly but thankfully our waitress suggested to share the Mac n cheese as an appetizer.   The Mac n cheese had a cream based sauce with the perfect hint of truffle oil. There was also shredded pork (but gave a vegetarian option if requested). Wow, best mac n cheese I've ever had, I still dream of it. The pork belly fell apart easily and was so very delectable.   Small family restaurant that locally sources the ingredients every week. Incredibly cheery, laidback atmosphere. Love it."}
{"text":"Yelp, you steered me so wrong! I rarely leave 1 star reviews, but I need to leave a warning for this overhyped and overpriced tourist trap.  The food was 3 stars, but minus 1 star for the ambience and minus 1 star for the poor price value.  What we ate:  The mac and cheese was a mess. The cheese sauce was watery and cream based, not rich and cheesy like mac and cheese that I've enjoyed in the past. The dish came out lukewarm, and was overly sweet. As I was eating it, all I could taste was the sugar.  The pork belly itself was spectacular, but it just came with a measly side of home made bread that didn't complement the flavor of the pork belly at all. I wish the side was better thought out, and included something fresh or green to offset the rich pork belly flavor.   We were seated on the bottom floor, where there were 4 tables. It was cold outside, and there's no waiting area. As the wait to dine here became longer, people crowded into the first floor to wait for their tables. My partner and I were surrounded on all sides while we were eating, cramped, people kept bumping into us, and \"family friendly\" meant there were several loud screaming and crying kids in the lobby.   Additionally, in order to pay you have to wait in line at a counter. After we decided we were done with the cramped uncomfortable experience we had to wait in line for another 15 minutes before we could pay and leave.   Maybe I caught Robin Square on a bad night, but for the price (2 entrees, 1 glass of wine + tip = $90 CAD) I really expected much much more. I don't mind paying for a good meal, but this was not it.   For a few dollars an entree more, dine at Bouillion Bilk (see my review here: https://www.yelp.com/biz/bouillon-bilk-montréal-2?hrid=AMAz7hz_hJq16xVAsdCZrw) which is a 15 minute walk down St Laurent. For a marginal increase in price, you'll have an unforgettable dining experience prepared by a real chef in a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Put this restaurant at the top of your \"to do\" list while in Montreal. Small space but by far some of the best food I've ever had in my life. The Mac and cheese.... to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is incredibly cute, the wait staff is incredibly nice and the food is full of interesting flavors! If you're looking for a delicious and relaxed place for dinner we highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This Mac and Cheese almost made me cry it was so incredibly, amazingly, insanely, unbelievably, delectably, (you get the idea) good.  It literally is the best thing I have ever eaten.  I am being 100% honest with both of the above statements, zero exaggeration.  I'm not going to waste your time reiterating what all the other reviewers have said. You MUST eat here if you are in MTL or vicinity. These people know how to restaurant and are 100% deserving of the true \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" Yelp rating."}
{"text":"Maple syrup in savory dishes? Why would you... Oh... I now understand the meaning of life.  After a long queue to get in the restaurant I was offered the last plate of pork belly which I couldn't refuse. The fattiness of the tender pork blended perfectly with the sweet smokiness of the maple syrup which caught me by surprise. I didn't expect the Canadian nectar of life to be in this dish - a pleasant surprise. The infamous mac and cheese also had maple syrup which works perfectly with the truffle oil. The food was fantastic.  As a Canadian, I'm proud of this restaurant showcasing the iconic maple syrup in many of the dishes. Good job Robin Square. If you happen to be nearby the Old Port then I'd recommend looking for a restaurant with a huge team Rocket 'R' stamped on the window. It'll blast you off at the speed of light."}
{"text":"Five stars on Yelp with over 100 reviews can't be wrong. Sincere passion for food and warm owners means staying open an hour late to serve a party of eight the most amazing combination of mac, cheese, ham, truffle, and maple."}
{"text":"In retrospect, I'm bumping this up to 5 stars because I can't stop thinking about that mac & cheese and it's been a month. That truffle oil."}
{"text":"Waited in line Saturday for about an hour and something. It's a tiny restaurant with passionate crew. You see them rushing up and down with sweat on their face but they always talk to you nice with smile and energy. You can feel that the rules of their house is active as posted on the wall by kitchen. On the opposite, let's talk about what's in the plate. We ordered the soup, ultimate experience (pork belly) and THE mac & cheese. The soup was fairly good, I can picture it served anywhere else still popular but definitely not the baguette came with it though. The pork belly lived up to its fame I guess. Cooked to the spot and served with interesting sauce. Finally, the mac & cheese, wasn't quite French in my opinion. It's mac&cheese with truffle oil topped with a huge pile of pulled pork I guess. Pork was too freaking sweet that ruined the whole plate. Scent of truffle was there when I started digging, but all washed away and covered by the sweetness of pork soon. Feels like I was having Dallas BBQ. I can tell from reaction of tables around me that I wasn't the only one thought that way.  One additional detail Le Robin can improve right away is back to the baguette. It was so dry and tasteless. If that's the only one you have available, better not serve it. You're killing your dish."}
{"text":"Oh boy... YOU HAVE TO GO HERE!!!!  I am a big foodie, so let me tell you, when I was exploring Montreal and was disappointed with the places I've gone, this place turned it all around. It was literally magical and amazing!!!   Foodwise, so freaking good. You will not be disappointed with whatever you get here! I started with the onion smoked jalapeño soup, which was so flavorful. It's surprisingly not spicy. Every sip is smooth, warm, and just so delicious. It was a great balance of onion, butter, and jalapeño. I literally finished my soup less than a minute! And the bread that came with it... Oh my gosh. The bread is made fresh every day and it was so great and complimented the soup so well. It was a match made in heaven. For my entree, I ordered the pork belly. When I found out that it takes the brother 5 days to prepare, well duhhhh, it was a given I had to try it. And thank goodness I did. It was so tender, juicy, and packed with flavor. It was accompanied with 2 puréed sauces, one was sweet sweet with apricot and one was savory with celery root and truffle oil (and probably some other godly things) and then topped off with a maple syrup and shallot sauce. Everything just worked all together. It was like a symphony in my mouth, blending all the flavors together to make one great food masterpiece. The portion was huge and fantastic. I was so stuffed by the end of it that I didn't have enough room for dessert!   Everything in this restaurant is local and fresh. My other coworkers came here another night and they loved what they got. They had the Mac and cheese which was amazing and the pork belly as well. The service was so sweet, catering and friendly!   This was the best place I went to when I stayed in Montreal. You don't want to miss the jewel. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"We came here for our first dinner in Montreal during our first year wedding anniversary. Thank Yelp! I only chose this place since the reviews mentioned this place just earned best restaurant of Montreal a few weeks ago.   It is an unsuspecting place near Mcdonalds. Here's a tip to make your wait shorter - just wait outside the door and don't go in to ask the waiter. They just send you out the door to wait.   The menu is quite small and everyone pretty much orders the same thing - the mac and cheese, and the pork belly. For good reason too. The mac and cheese comes with beef brisket and is not too cheesy, a little sweet, just something like you've never tasted before or imagined Mac and cheese could be. The pork belly is even more of a winner - the fatty parts perfectly melt in your mouth - I had a mouth orgasm eating this. Sighhhhhh. Perfect.   The beers are cheap and they give you a lot. The total bill is very reasonable with each dish being around 23-30$. Love love love this place. Better than the Michelin's I have eaten in NYC."}
{"text":"Food has never tasted so good. I feel I need a bigger vocabulary to explain in detail the amazing tastes that are flowing through my body. My taste buds have exploded and been reborn, I'm not sure I'll ever eat the same again!   I'll start with the service, as I was near turned off by coming in; with a sign on the door that read please wait here. It is a very small place. Yet, I was greeted at the door with a extremely friendly face. Welcoming me in and seating me. She grabbed a vase of water and filled my cup as she described the restaurant and the cook. I was told by the person next to me the soup (celery and blue cheese) was amazing, so I grabbed a half order. Please, do yourself a favor and don't order more than that unless you don't plan on eating your full main meal! Yet, if you don't try it, you'll be missing out.   The host/waitress/owner recommended that I try either the Mac and cheese or \"the ultimate experience\". I picked the ladder. And this is the reason I wrote you the longest review I've ever written, because this place cannot be passed up! The ultimate experience was pork belly that melted when the knife touched it just right. A nice crispy top with the most tender, melt in your mouth, middle. They say it takes five days to prepare. I took my first bite...melted into nothing, then picked up my phone to write this.   Alcoholic beverage: sortilege (Canadian whisky and maple syrup) DELICIOUS!  So....I was chatting and stated I was from Texas and was sad I wouldn't be able to try the mac and cheese; they brought out a plate of the mac and cheese and told me, \"you have to try our signature dishes.\" I'm blown away!!   Whatever God you pray to, pray you live long enough to make your way to Le Robin Square; the best overall food establishment in all of Montreal, if not North America!"}
{"text":"This restaurant may be small in size, but it is HUGE in flavorful foods.  Family owned and operated all the way from Mama who bakes the breads to big brother who is a magnificent chef to little sister Sylvia Robin who is highly animated and filled with personality!  Go there early and try everything!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Two words:  Food love!  This place is a find!  It's kind of a hole in the wall--small storefront not a lot of ambiance.  But the food...like something out of the movie Burnt with Canadian portions.  I had the Foie Gras with brined duck breast and gingerbread, and a succulent Jacuzzi'd calamari with a chorizo risotto with fava beans.  Michelin star stuff without the white tablecloths.  And without the $$$$ prices.  Family owned and operated--they are there and they care.  Excellent service.  Only downside:  it's a bit noisy.  Get there early or prepare to wait a while."}
{"text":"The mac and cheese should be illegal. Doesn't even make sense how good it is. I'm sure the rest of the menu is great too. Awesome staff (it's family-run). Try to visit this place if you can."}
{"text":"The food was good and interesting,  the wait staff lovely BUT the noise level was ridiculous.  The base was so loud on the music that my chair was vibrating. The incredibly loud pulsating music blasted the whole time and made what would have been a very nice dinner, not very enjoyable.  Don't understand how people can enjoy a meal in these circumstances.  It's not a night club!"}
{"text":"Like everyone else has said- the Mac and cheese is phenomenal. We got the ham on the side but I'm sure it's just as good on top. The staff was friendly and welcoming even with 2 kids and a baby in tow."}
{"text":"Delicious pork belly and Mac&cheese with truffle oil. Will be back when I visit Montreal again"}
{"text":"Malheureusement très déçue par mon expérience chez Robin Square. Pour situer le contexte: nous nous rendons dans le vieux Montreal un samedi soir, et dans le coin il est difficile de trouver un resto abordable et bon, ou qui n'est pas trop touristique. Grâce à Yelp et aux nombreux avis positifs nous nous rendons chez Robin Square. Il y a la queue devant la porte, mais rien d'insurmontable à vue d'il. On se glisse dans la file, sans savoir ce sui nous attend car ce n'est qu'une bonne heure et demi plus tard que nous entrons dans le resto, affamés, et agacés par l'attente. Le service, très aimable, nous explique le principe du restaurant : de la cuisine familiale, généreuse, qui favorise les produits locaux: parfait comme description! On commade donc la pizza à la burrata (c'est la maman qui fait la pâte), le mac and cheese au jambon dont la recette est celle de Noël dans la famille Robin et la salade caesar géante. Nous avons été déçus de ce qui nous a été servi. Certes, on sent bien qu'on y mange comme à la maison mais la qualité n'y est pas par rapport au prix et à toute l'attente! 22 dollar pour une pizza minuscules avec une moitié de burrata, une pate est bien trop dure, et par contre une bonne sauce tomate. 18$ pour une salade caesar assez classique à la sauce pas très prononcée mais au bon poulet rôti. La surprise est surtout pour le mac and cheese, le jambon est bon mais trop sucré et on est écuré trop rapidement. Dommage."}
{"text":"My family and I tried the famous Mac and Cheese. Though I enjoyed it, nobody else in my party did. The dish gets balanced when you add the hot sauce that comes with it (and you're supposed to add it, but the waiter didn't explain it to us), but, if you don't, the ham is too sweet and, since the macaroni doesn't have a strong flavor, the whole dish gets dessert-like sweet. As I said, it gets better when you add the hot sauce, but we only figured that out after we had had half the dish."}
{"text":"We are out of towners visiting Montreal for only a few days. This restaurant is a MUST visit! The service is attentive and extremely friendly, and the food is delicious. We started off with the soup of the day (a creamy onion soup) and I have never had something so delicious! We continued with the Mac and cheese and the pizza. The cheese on the pizza was some of the freshest cheese I've ever had. Overall amazing. Would give more stars if I could!"}
{"text":"We arrived after 8:30PM mid-week, and they appeared to have closed early.  Sylvia spied us peeking in the window, and insisted on re-opening for us.  And we were glad she did!  Very limited menu, but well-chosen.  The four of us shared the pork belly, the Guinea fowl with gnocchi, the mac and cheese, and the beet salad (red and golden with Mom's homemade cheese).  Each dish was as delicious as the next.  Fresh, local ingredients.  The setting is simple storefront, but don't let this stop you.  This family-run (brother chef, sister hostess, mother) place is full of love and passion for cooking and making every customer feel like part of the family.  Absolutely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Small place, exceptional food, absolutely charming Robin Family members are responsible for all the food, the service, and the decor. Highly recommend. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite spot while visiting Montreal. This family owned restaurant was so warm and friendly. Sylvia was so accommodating of our large party and so patient for us out-of-towners. The truffle Mac and cheese was amazing. Get everything as designed by the chef. Don't change a thing! Great for lunch or dinner or dessert with a delicious glass of wine."}
{"text":"Just an amazing meal. Everything about this was fantastic. From the service, ambiance and the food was terrific."}
{"text":"I really want to eat at Le Robin Square but I just cannot make myself and my travel mate to wait for 2 hours?! Some advanced planning we ended up coming here just when the door opened and got seated right away.  The restaurant has a nice and homey feel. Just like eating at some one house. The menu is limited in selection which I love.   Foie Gras Mi-Cuit and Dried Duck Magret ($25) - White Port Wine Foie Gras from Rougie, Gin and Blueberry Magret, Citrus Marmelade, Ginger Spiced Bread  Beet Salad ($18) - Red and yellow beets, Peningouin Cheese, Oro Nobil White Balsamic, Abbae Olive Oil, White Truffle Oil, Caramelized Walnuts  Calamari Inspired by my Friend Jonathan Lanciault ($40) - Calamari Cooked Sous-Vide 5 hour, saffron and tarrragon risotto, lobster mushrooms, smoked chorizo, fava beans, fresh tomatoes, shredded parmesan, Pont Blanc Cheese Mousse, fried plantains and pumpernickel bread  The Ultimate Experience ($34) - Brined, smoked and braised Nagano Pork Belly, Truffle Celery-Root Puree, Pear and Apricot Jam and Wine and Maple Syrup Albufera    A lot of interesting elements in all the dish we ordered. Most of them was a hit. I am though so so with Sous-Vide Calamari when compared to the sides which were so good on the  same plate. And at $40?  At this price point, I do have my doubts for a repeat visit. But it is at least worth a try as I do understand a lot of attention and time and prep work was used to prepare every single dish."}
{"text":"Really good. Get the Cornish Hen for two. A very upscale and stylish placed, with a great view of old buildings and Museum"}
{"text":"My review here concerns only the cuisine as the service was courteous and attentive throughout my visit.  Le Robin Square is well-reviewed on Yelp, and perhaps this was a one-off bad experience or my family and I were simply the minority.  We ordered the Cream of Squash, Mac and Cheese along with the Pork belly as many on here recommended. The cream of squash was rich and smooth, but is better priced at a 4$/bowl as opposed to 8$/bowl with its array of ingredients.  While I fully understand and appreciate the deliberate nature of the sweetness in the Mac&Cheese, the dish itself had coarse salt distributed unevenly throughout which ruined it--my entire family had the unfortunate experience of chewing on these salt clusters and were sure (hopefully) that this wasn't the chef's intent. After searching through the low-star reviews on Yelp for this place, its clear we weren't the only ones that experienced the coarse salt pellets in the Mac&Cheese. I hope the chef can take this into heart during his next prep.  As for the pork belly, the entire dish itself with its two purees were sweet. The texture of the pork belly itself was nothing short of perfect, but while I am a fan of slow-cooked sweet meats this dish left me overwhelmed when combined with the Mac&Cheese. The waiter should probably strongly advise against the sharing of these two entrees.  Overall, I can't say this is sensational cuisine and most definitely can't say this is a reflection of fine French dining. The absence of flavour contrast in the entrees (we picked two of three that were available) along with the lack of finesse in the Mac&Cheese makes this place a hard-sell for its price point."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! That Mac & cheese and the pork belly were deeeelicous!!! The chicken Caesar salad was ok, not so special compared to the two other dishes I had but created a nice balance overall."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner with my boyfriend and it was lovely and so delicious! Our waitress was one of the owners and she was delightful. I had the Mac and cheese with ham and it was one of my best meals to date. Boyfriend had the pork belly which he also said was one of his top meals. The restaurant is very cool and we sat upstairs with a good view of the place. Beers were excellent as well, I recommend the amber/blonde tracteur. Overall amazing dinner and restaurant,  the food is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"The food was perfect, all courses.  One of those dining experiences that will be etched in memory.  The most impressive pry was when the bartender came out to our table and asked what we had ordered for entrees. He then suggested tailor-made cocktails specific to our liquor of choice to pit with our entree.   Straight off-menu, right down to the details of which bitters and mixers to select.  Incredible idea and definitely felt taken care of.  Waitstaff was great, explained the history of this family run restaurant.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This was our first meal in Montreal and it's going to be hard to top.  Chic and quaint ambience with excellent, friendly staff.  This restaurant is family owned and has a great vibe.  The food was out of this world!!!  Without a doubt the BEST mac & cheese I've ever had.  The macaroni was perfectly cooked, slightly al dente, and oh so creamy.  The ham that came with the mac & cheese dish was so tender and exquisitely flavored with perfect combination of sweet and subtle sweetness.  The beet salad was incredible, too.  I wish I were hungrier so that I could have ordered more food.  Definitely coming back to order the pork belly."}
{"text":"The best meal that I had during my two weeks in Canada! I would say that this restaurant served me one of the top 10 meals I've ever eaten. It's quite small inside, but if there is a line outside the door for a table, I suggest you get in it. The Ultimate Feast and the macaroni were absolutely amazing! Would recommend to any foodie traveling through Montreal!"}
{"text":"Beware this is a long review so TLDR- The food is meh and really nothing amazing/ out of this world so I don't really understand the rave yelp reviews/ people saying they came out of town just to eat here...and service is weird/ not good. I'm a huge foodie and am used to fine dining all over the world. My boyfriend works in the industry too and this was just one of the worst service experiences we had.   We'd been to MTL before and didn't get to eat here so I was pretty excited that they finally started taking reservations after the reopening.   Idk if they sold this restaurant after the revamp to new owners but I get absolutely no \"mom/pop vibe\" here...and the new menu seems to make the classic dishes worse. we ordered the burrata dish bc the old burrata pizza looked amazing- it was good but nothing I haven't had before at other places. Mac and cheese with brisket was average. It's not even really Mac and cheese...it's just rigatoni in reduced cream with a ton of truffle oil and a chunk of brisket on top. There is no cheese in this dish. The old pics seem to show more tangy bbq brisket but the new Mac and cheese is just a boring chunk on top. Very disappointed in the dish. Sure it's flavorful but you can make anything taste flavorful with that much truffle oil. And the pork belly was not ultimate. It was good but honestly not memorable ...tastes like any pork belly I've had at other fine dining places. And def not worth the price compared to other meat dishes we saw other tables eating...the size was so small. My bf is in the industry and we know pork belly is a super cheap cut. That dish is not worth more than 25 dollars even with restaurant markups.   Anyways this would have been a 3-4 star review based on the food bc it was average but rly nothing special. However the service was rly bad and rude here. Two other tables who sat after us got their orders taken before us. We were literally sitting at our tables waiting for someone to take our order. To make that worse, some waiter came up to me and asked if she could take my menu away. \"Um...ok. That's weird. Why?\" She goes \"oh it looks like you know what you want so I just need to borrow one for another table\". I reply \"ok...but no one has taken our order yet...\" she goes \"oh that person there will take your order shortly\". Ten minutes later he doesn't take our order and the woman who stole my menu goes up to him to tell him to serve us. He looks at our table and sees me staring at them. What the eff is this bizarre service?!?! And worst of all NO apology given to us. No \"sorry for your wait\" or anything. He just came over and said \"all right what would you like to order\". He also wasn't wearing an apron so I believe he was the manager of the restaurant covering some tables....  Anyways the meal here was just disappointing. I was hoping for some home made dishes with warm friendly mom/pop vibes and instead just got average food with horrible, weird service."}
{"text":"We were lucky to get a table when we walked in on a Saturday night at 7 pm without a reservation. We started with the calamari appetizer which was excellent. The flavors were amazing - coconut and olives- and the calamari was so tender. They soak it for hours in milk - so amazing! We came for the Mac and cheese (make sure you get it with brisket!!), which was really good. They have half portions, which I highly recommend; it's a super rich meal.  We also ordered a half portion of the gnocchi. It was good, yet also very rich. All of their dishes are heavy and rich, and there isn't a salad on the menu to help pace your meal.  We were full after the one calamari app and two half dinners which we didn't even finish.  We were there for awhile, the food came out slowly, so be prepared for a leisurely meal.  Our waitress is a Robin, her brother is the chef - it's a family affair. I definite recommend this fun, delicious restaurant in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"I was in town and visiting and found on it yelp. I'll keep it simple, the food was delicious and the service was even better. Must go!"}
{"text":"Customer service was awesome.  Food portions are kind of small maybe because we got no ham with our mac and cheese. They did not have a substitute for the ham, wish they did.  Mac and cheese was great but a little over hyped, very unique approach to it had salty and creamy fusion to it.  Ambiance was excellent.   Overall I would try it again."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the waitress and hostess very friendly.  However, the meal lacked luster. The Mac and cheese as other reviewers have said was ruined by coarse rock salt and lack of cheese but cream that tasted like cooked heavy cream that truffle oil was added to. The pork belly although larger than most portions elsewhere, nowhere near tasted like it took 5 days to prepare as stated. I have tasted better pork in my slow cooker for much less than a day. For all the ingredients noted in these recipes, the taste was not as expected."}
{"text":"Exceptional Service.. the food was amazing - true to all the reviews! The sauces were delicious.... I really like sweet & savory meals so this was right up my ally.."}
{"text":"Wow!  We had an amazing experience here. The soup of the day was perfection. Creamy and spicy; it doesn't get any better than that. We got the salmon and the pork belly. Everything was plated beautifully!  The salmon was cooked to perfection; crispy skin side down, all the delicate flavors of the pear and apricot really shone through. Loved the potatoes, so thin and delicate.  The pork belly dish was the star; melt in your mouth tenderness with the complimentary purees were delightful. We were only disappointed that our stomachs were not large enough for dessert."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff, excellent food, good wine, what else does one want. The Mac & cheese and goat Cheese dishes are fabulous.  Use the very spicy sauce, cautiously. Medium heat is more than enough."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had. The food is truly art.  The mac and cheese is like no other I've had before.  My husband got the ultimate and it was phenomenal. This place is truly a gem."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Get there before it opens because the lineup can be up to an hour long (or more!) As a group of five, we tried nearly everything on the supper menu and I have to say every item was fantastic! The pizza burrata had fresh cheese that was imported the night before (it's delivered every second Friday). The mac and cheese was a nice big sharing portion. The pork belly literally melts in your mouth and the guinea fowl came with a fantastic sauce. All the main courses  we tried had a sweet note to them, so if you have a mildly sweet tooth, you will be in love with them all. The one dish I enjoyed less was the beet salad, mainly because I am not a fan of truffle oil, but if you enjoy truffles, you will love this dish as well.   This place is definitely worth waiting in line for, but if it is your first time in Montreal and you don't want to waste your time, there are other great restaurants in the area worth trying out. If you are a Montrealer, you should just gather three or four of your closest friends and head over for a meal right now."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants I have ever been too. The staff was amazing, friendly, and welcoming.  We had the Mac and cheese and pork belly, both were superb.   I would highly recommend this restaurant to any one who comes to Montreal.  I plan on coming back and eating here again soon."}
{"text":"Great experience! Every plate on the menu is homemade from scratch with local ingredients. It's a family business and the service was personal and attentive. Potions are generous, Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant based on Yelp reviews, since everything else is closed on Boxing Day. But man! We did not regret this decision! The hostess/owner has contagious enthusiasm and pride of the food. She was making small talks with us and other customers the whole night. As someone in customer service industry, I have utmost respect to her for maintaining this level of professionalism and energy all day everyday. The Ultimate Experience is a must try. The pork belly literally melted in my mouth when I took a bite. The ham in the mac & cheese is equally DELICIOUS. The beef skirt is good but pales in comparison with the other two out-of-this-world dishes. All in all, a wonderful experience. Would definitely come back in the future."}
{"text":"So this was the pricey meal of my Montreal adventures!  We were informed by our waitress that the small menu allows them to source local and sustainable ingredients while making sure that consistency is achieved.  There are a few core menu items that are the most popular (and thus are permanent) but they rotate the other menu items out depending on the produce available.    The biggest sellers for the main courses are \"The Ultimate Experience\" and the Mac and cheese.  Naturally we went with what the waitress recommended and were not disappointed!  We started off with the soup of the day and crispy brie cheese as an appetizer and let me warn you to make sure you're hungry if you're getting these as the richness may rob you of your appetite before the main courses arrive!  The brie was extraordinarily creamy and paired with with the provided salad and bread.  The soup was a butternut squash with roasted orange peppers and was also delightfully creamy (and had a slight kick to it).  Fortunately we were still hungry when our main courses arrived.  My friend got the Ultimate Experience (pork belly that was \"Braised for 3 days\" according to our waitress) while the rest of us got the Mac and Cheese.    My friend enjoyed his braised pork belly and I thoroughly enjoyed the mac and cheese BUT be warned that the ham (which was fabulous) has a sweetness to it which permeates into the mac and cheese which to me was awesome, but not as awesome to my friend who wasn't expecting it so be warned!    Overall the experience was pleasant, the service was attentive and we left satisfied.  This place is upscale however and the prices reflect that (Mac and cheese was the \"cheapest\" at 23$ CAD while the Ultimate Experience was 35$+).  While I enjoyed my meal here, it's definitely not something I would have frequently."}
{"text":"Love that this is a family run place. Everything made with love. Attentive service, delicious food and drinks. Was a nice little find in Old Montreal. Will definitely be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Mom and pop shop; sisters are servers, brother is the chef and mom does the desserts. Everything is \"made with love\" and as corney as that sounds, appears to accurately describe the made from scratch and home cooked feel of this cosey eatery.  The place is pretty tiny, maybe holds 15-20 tables of average size. The sisters do a pretty good job of keeping an eye on everyone, and the older sisters bubbly personality made us feel at home.   Food: the menu is very limited. With that being said there is enough variety to cover different tastes and they have beer and wine to match the meal or your tastes.   The star or the menu is the Mac and cheese. I was skeptical at first but there is not another dish like this in my Mac and cheese adventures and deletions and fantastic seem like hollow descriptions in comparison.   The roast beast with mushrooms and huge slices of bacon was the most ordered and most popular. Almost a stew, the beef fell apart with a fork and each spoonful held a magical moment with bacon and mushrooms in some kind of magical sauce. The bread is fresh made every day and comes already buttered to help you sop up every tasty bite.   Honorable mention goes to the butternut squash soup and goat cheese with dried tomato tarte, both loved by those who ordered it, but not quite my style.  For dessert, momma Robin had cheesecake, Creme brûlée, and a bread pudding that disappeared despite grumbles of full bellies before they hit the table. The sauce on the pudding is fantastic, but a little dry for me. The cheesecake was more cheese like than sweet and made a perfect compliment after dinner. The Creme brûlée was good too and all came with a chunk of semisweet chocolate.   If my talent as a wordsmith has not impressed you, I will condense the above for you. I would go out of my way to visit again. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Dining at Le Robin Square was a wonderful experience. This cozy, family run restaurant is the perfect place for a memorable dinner. I was dining solo so my server offered half portions of the restaurant's two most popular dishes: Our Incredible Mac & Cheese and The Ultimate Experience. The Mac & Cheese was addictive! The soft noodles were covered in a garlic infused cream sauce with Swiss cheese and topped with tender flavorful Christmas Ham. The Ultimate Experience was also amazing. This is a cut of Nagano Pork Belly that is brined, smoked and braised over a three-day period. The pork was sublime and literally melts in your mouth. It is a perfect combination of tender meat, fattiness and crisp skin. The side sauces of Truffle Celery Root Puree, Pear and Apricot Jam, and Wine and Maple Syrup Albufera compliment the meat perfectly. The entrees were so good, I could not resist their Cheesecake dessert which is served in a mason jar, perfectly creamy and sweet, and served with crunchy granola chunks and a stick of dark chocolate. I intend to visit this restaurant again next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"I cannot stress enough how awesome the food is here! We had such a delicious meal (soupe du jour was cream of cauliflower, then did fried polenta, Mac and cheese, and foie gras, with pudding chômeur for dessert) and our server was so friendly and fast. We didn't take pictures of our food because we were too busy devouring it. Do yourself a favor and go here while in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Very unassuming little family-run place in Old Montréal. We almost walked right past it without realizing it, and very glad we didn't!  The food here is some of the best we've had in Montréal, and the service was so friendly and accommodating, in both French and English. It was obvious that the people there were there because they enjoy running a restaurant and creating a great experience for diners, and they did so very successfully!  The Mac and Cheese dish was an amazing and flavourful new take on an old classic, and everyone at our table had to have some. The highest praise from our party was reserved for the \"Ultimate Experience\" dish, which was an aptly named pork belly served with some miraculous sauces. So amazing, and so sad when the plate was finally empty!  We'll be back on our next trip to Montréal, without question."}
{"text":"Stop debating where you should go. Just go to Robin Square right now. The mac and cheese is a perfect blend of delicate flavors including two cheeses and truffle oil. It's topped with home made honey baked ham. Stop reading. Just go. Fine. Not convinced? The staff is helpful and friendly. The salad had home made croutons and succulent braised meat. Why are you reading this? Stop. Go there now!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a terrible dinner at La Maree. I got Mac n Cheese to go.  Lovely!!  The reviews are right.  Bring your bottle and eat here."}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this place enough. This was not just the best food I had in Montreal, but one of the best meals I've ever had! They had a very affordable 3 courses for 40CAD. The service was impeccable and the ambiance was casual but a nice dining experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very small. It's a family owned business and everything's local. Its food is really good: The chili con carne comes with rice. It's really hot at first, so be careful! I wanted to eat the whole chili, but I could not (Already full). My tablemates got a Redneck grilled cheese, which is HUGE. A normal grilled cheese would literally be half the size of this one.  The bathroom is one-person.  I would definitely go back here, but alas, I don't live in Montreal."}
{"text":"Outstanding first meal in Montreal. Thanks to yelp for the recommendation. No wait at 6pm. Staff was super friendly, some of them are family of the owner. Loved everything we ordered - three of us shared the creamy onion soup with jalapeños, Ultimate (perfect pork belly), and mac and cheese with Christmas ham.  Plenty of food considering we smacked at a Chinese bakery on the way over.  No room for desert (until we walked around town a bit)"}
{"text":"BEST. EXPERIENCE. EVER.    [situation] The boyfriend and I were planning a day in Old Port and we wanted to end the day with a nice restaurant. Obviously, I referred to yelp! Le Robin Square has often popped up when I search for restaurants, but it never really appealed too me. It seemed like every other restaurant. This time, after our initial plan fell through, we decided to look into it. And WOW! The reviews were incredible!! But a lot of people said that it's the best food they've ever had and I thought they were clearly exaggerating. Anyways, I've never seen such positive reviews before, so we went!   [experience] We arrived and had to wait outside, as there was not a lot of space inside. A waitress quickly came over and asked us how many we were and told us we'd have to wait about 30min.   We waited maybe 10min before a counter seat opened up and we took it. The waitresses that helped us were all so sweet and they told us a little bit about the restaurant's history.   I got the Mac and Cheese and my boyfriend got the ultimate experience.   The waitress made sure to tell me to mix my Mac and cheese before eating it, or it'll be too salty. I imagine some customers have complained before, because they didn't stir it.   [food review] The Mac and cheese was INCREDIBLE!! So creamy, so flavourful, cooked to perfection, just amazing!!! Each bite was a little piece of heaven! The pork belly (with the ultimate experience) was extraordinary! It melts in your mouth!! It's been 2 days and we still occasionally turn to each other and say \"remember that Mac and cheese? Omg! So good!!\" I was so sad when I reached my last few bites! I wanted it to never end! After we were done, we were extremely full though! Ah, the food was just too spectacular!   I've had a lot of good food, but this was actually, hands down the best meal I have ever had. The other reviews were not lying after all. I can't wait to go back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is amazing! Had the \"ultimate experience\" pork belly, which the waitress said was cooked over 5 days. I definitely believe it. The meat just melted in my mouth and was extremely flavorful, even before using the truffle oil celery puree or the apricot saucer, both of which were outstanding. The place is tiny and the lines last forever, so the best way is to go right before it opens and you should be good. Will definitely return again to try out the other stuff on the menu!"}
{"text":"This little lunch heaven deserves all of the praise it gets!   It's a tight squeeze, but they helped me riggle my stroller in and get seated. Immediately upon getting settled everyone who worked there popped by to squeeze our baby, and tell me they're a family run business and one of them is expecting and how they would all be serving us. Incredibly nice.   I couldn't resist ordering a plate of spaghetti in meat sauce and my darling date had their quiche. It was all incredible. You can taste the homemade love in everything they do. If I lived or worked around here, I would be here all. The. Time."}
{"text":"BEST MEAL EVER!!!!   The Mac and cheese with ham - it is to die for!!!!  The ultimate experience - it was just that!!!  The cheesecake - good.   Wait time- 15 mins Staff- absolutely lovely  The hostess/cashier was very perky and cheerful. She thanked us numerous times for waiting patiently upon calling us for our table and when we paid for our meal.   The Mac and cheese with Christmas ham was FULL of flavor!! We never had ham this good. Not at thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter or any holiday dinner! The Mac and cheese was light and creamy.   The pork belly was the best pork belly I've ever had! With the two purée spreads, one is savory and the other sweet. It was a perfect mix! Everything was fresh and delicious!!   You guys really lived up to all your reviews!!"}
{"text":"Le Robin Square is a family business and therefore a very welcoming place. The waiters were helpful, friendly and entertaining, chatting with customers from time to time. The menu is quite short, but the food was crazy good. We had the pork belly and the mac'n'cheese (the two most popular dishes we were told) and we definitely recommend trying both, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I have had French food in French cities including Paris, and in Montreal, this place is definitely among the top ones. What really differentiates the food here is the thoughts that were put into each plate. Also love the short menu that varies from season to season and The artisanal and local beers that I have never heard of despite been a native montrealer.t  My friend took the mac and cheese without the ham and I took the porc belly. Both were heavenly.   Really love the subtle truffle flavor and the discrete grains of salt in the mac and cheese. The crispy porc belly was amazing. The prune(?) sauce was a bit sweet to my taste though.  Finally poudine chômeur (poor man's puddine) was incredible.   The place is small and does not take reservations. Services are very good. Will definitely revisit"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp we found this place. Starters was awesome. Goat cheese tomato tartelette, Beet salad and Foie Gras Mi-Crit. The Buckthorn berry jam, was incredible and made me miss DK, never had this outside Denmark. The White wine we had with it was perfect. Starters alone was 5 stars. Had the recommended Mac&Cheese and The Ultimate Experience. Both was good but too sweet in the taste for us, some green beans with the pork would have been good. The local IPA was great to this food."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, probably one of the best in Montreal. Totally family-run, great atmosphere and great food. They were also very able to accommodate someone in our group with a gluten allergy."}
{"text":"Selected this restaurant based on wonderful Yelp reviews, walking distance from hotel and within my price range. Yes the menu is limited and yes you may feel a bit squeezed in but once you are welcomed by the wonderful caring staff and begin to delight your taste buds, nothing matters than the sensations you are putting in your mouth. The creamed red pepper soup was smooth with just the right amount of kick and a buttered piece of bread  served on the side is certainly no afterthought as it was just as good.  I have NEVER ordered Mac and cheese at a restaurant (too many bad memories of making it from the box as it was the only Mac and cheese my kids would eat) but this one was elevated to a whole new level with the truffle oil, salt and Christmas ham. Although pork belly got excellent reviews and we were ready to try it, seeing it come out convinced us to go with the calamari that had so many unusual and interesting ingredients that we were well rewarded by our choice. Excellent and friendly service, a culinary treat for your palette and all provided in a family run business."}
{"text":"Really great food at a great price. Like other reviews have said, a family owned restaurant with a funky ambiance and great staff. We had the mac and cheese and spinach salad, and both were amazing (especially the mac with truffle oil, do not miss this). A great find amongst more touristy options, we will be back!"}
