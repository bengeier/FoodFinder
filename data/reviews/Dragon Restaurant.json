{"text":"I order from here fairly frequently. I enjoy the food and the service is decent. Prices are from the high end of the low scale up to the mid level scale. It's pretty good food for the most part."}
{"text":"I ate here probably hundreds of times in the early 90's when this place opened in the River Square Plaza and was called simply \"Schezuan\". 

After a several year hiatus (due to geography) I was happy to see that they were still around and had changed the name to the snappier \"Dragon\".  

I don't know if there was a change of ownership along with the name change, but the service is a friendly as it ever was, which is to say VERY.  

This is really good greasy spoon Chinese, with some random Thai dishes thrown in.  The prices are really inexpensive, and usually orders are are ready in a very short amount of time (10-15 minutes). 

Despite being just a little bit farther away than three or four other Chinese take-out places, this has become our go to spot.  Check them out."}
{"text":"It has become an informal tradition to get take out on Valentine's Day. I have no idea why.
 
After entering the Dragon(ha,ha...groan), we ordered spring roll(very light and tasty), scallion pancakes(which we'd never tried before.They were chewy in a good way and also very tasty), veggie potstickers(bland city), and our current stand by- tofu general tso's and sweet and sour tofu. The last two dishes had good sauces, but the tofu seemed to evaporate inside of its fried outer coating. 

I waited with the dog in the parking lot while my wife waited for the food. We then headed to Giant Eagle for beverages, when all hell broke loose. Cruising down Clifton blvd, the dog chunked( or chundered if you will). Then we argued about turning the heat down in the car. I wear a coat and need little heat. The wife likes to make the car a blast furnace. We arrived at Giant Eagle to men leaving in droves with arms full of roses and chocolates. Place was packed. Picking up some pop,soymilk and beer took about 25 minutes. Food was promptly reheated at home. But it was rewarding to have all that grub after scrubbing out the backseat and nearly sweating to death.

It's not super great food, but the staff was very friendly and were open when a lot of restaurants would already be winding down on a Sunday. Happy Chinese Valentine's Day everyone."}
