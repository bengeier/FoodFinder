{"text":"Great place, friendly people, and good food. Today was my 3rd visit and got the fish sandwich which came highly recomended. it was a huge piece of cod with lettuce and tomatoes on a delicious bun. I also will recommend this to my family and friends when they are in the area."}
{"text":"Definitely great pizza! We ordered the Buffalo Blu Wings... delicious! We ordered them 3 times in the past week! If your looking for yummy wings, definitely try these!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in town. Great!  Affordable!  Quick!  I love it and would recommend to all!!"}
{"text":"We live within walking distance, and we really liked the previous place. For our first pizza, we ordered the Buffalo Chicken and it was VERY good! Loved the tomato slices and pickles! We will DEFINITELY try a more \"traditional\" pizza next! We will return :)"}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. We ordered pizza and wing special. Really good food. Very impressed."}
{"text":"We have ordered here a couple of times. The first, we ordered a taco pizza to be delivered.  It came in a very timely manner....nice & hot and not a bad price. It was tasty, but I didn't much like the sauce they used on the crust under all the toppings.   Decided tonight to give them another shot....and we were NOT disappointed!  My husband ordered a small seafood pizza. He said it was pretty good, except the seasonings on top were \"kind of strange\" and it was really greasy.......but yummy nonetheless. I got a small pepperoni with black olives.  Very good!! Mac & cheese bites were standard and good.   The staff was very friendly....from the initial call to order to the pickup. Decent prices. Great menu. We will certainly be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"really bad. ordered pizza and wings - were surprised at how quickly it arrived on a Friday evening, but the food was just not good. everything was clearly packaged, pre-made food. the wings seemed to be frozen and then fried and the sauce had little flavor.  pizza had little flavor and toppings were clearly not fresh - the sausage was uniform, frozen, flavorless balls of \"meat\" we're always happy to support a local business, but this just didn't do it for us.  2 stars for delivery speed."}
{"text":"Housed in a building that has been 3 pizza shops and a hotdog shop in the 7 years we've lived in Heidelberg, we ordered on 10/25 when I was responsible for watching my four kids for moms night out.  I was pleased to see there was an online order form... The button was right in the middle of the heading of the page.  My son and I browsed the fairly generic menu (all stock photos of cheese pizzas).  I was surprised to see that there were no listed specials... We opted for a buffalo chicken and a cheese lovers.  Total came to $34.    I waited for 15 minutes and called to see how I'd know when to pick up my order.  The gentleman I talked to said that the website wasn't working, and he'd have to put the order in then.  I asked him about specials, and they said they had two larges with one topping for $20. I ordered an extra cheese and a sausage. He told me 20 mins.   I went after 20 mins.  The pizza was ready and being held in a delivery bag.  The pizza was hot, total came to $20.83.  The lady behind the counter was friendly.  I took the pizza home and gave it to the real critics... My kids.  The pizza is par.  We prefer a little less sauce. It was slightly acidic, but not overbearing.  There were a couple of large chunks of stewed tomatoes, which didn't bother me.  The crust is doughy, but not soggy.  The cheese mix was adequate on the extra-cheese pizza, but it wasn't a lot.  The sausage pizza had an impressive amount of sausage, but was lacking in cheese. The center of the pizza was nearly bare, just sauce and sausage.   It is average Pittsburgh pizza.  Nothing amazing, and not bad.   I would avoid using the website, unless you need a menu overview... But again, Pittsburgh pizza shop with a typical pizza / calzone / salad / fried stuff menu.   In the store, which is carry out only, there was a menu with three coupons good until 12/31/15. One is for 2 XL 1 topping pizzas for $19.99.  One for four large 1 topping pizza's for $32.99. One for  Lunch special, $5.99 1 topping small pizza.  We'll likely order from here again, calling to order, simply because it is convenient.  If they follow the path of the previous shops and their quality is depleted as time goes on, it likely will not last long.  There are a lot of options in Heidelberg / Carnegie / Bridgeville for pizza... Pizza America is not Fiori's by a long shot, but it is better than Little Caesars."}
{"text":"Fantastic, this place delivers what you want. Extra crispy wings, a proper cheesesteak- Wiz is an option- and the pizza is phenomenal. Specialty, regular, they do it right. Plus the delivery is typically before time and always polite."}
{"text":"I called to order a pizza but I was asked if I'd be interested in the daily special. It was a HUGE cod sandwich! I want expecting much, but it was very good. Since I work nearby, I'll probably order more."}
{"text":"It's so........... decent?  Yeah... Ya know how some pizza places have a distinct \"ah yes, I get it!\"? Well, this one, in my opinion, gets nothing particularly wrong, and nothing (besides quick friendly delivery) particularly right.  It's serviceable pizza, better than Raya's, not as good as Tomato's 2, and unlike Fox's, it's open.  This review is very much based on the location, Carnegie.  I feel like we need  just one really great pizza place, ya know?  Well... back to the drawing board I guess."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch because I liked the place that use to be in this location.  This location has been a couple of pizza shops and a hot dog shop in between.   Anyway, there are specials going on for the opening.  We had a pizza with pepperoni.  The crust is medium in thickness and was well cooked and a little crunchy.  The sauce and cheese were good.  The people in the shop were very friendly."}
{"text":"This location had been several different restaurants, and I went in to try this latest iteration. There's nowhere to sit here, so it's strictly takeout (or delivery). The guy at the counter, possibly the owner, was very friendly, helping me through the menu and answering questions. I ordered the calzone, which was satisfying cheesy. As others have said, it could use a pass with the oregano shaker, and next time I'll ask him to cook it a little longer, but it was a good calzone. I swear, he must have started cooking it as I read the menu, because it only took about seven minutes from ordering to giving it to me. I'm a big eater, and this calzone made three meals for me. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Pizza Americana is fresh, quick, and always a delicious meal! They are also very reasonably priced, especially for the quality! Some favorites of mine are the buffalo chicken pizza (the pickles on top sound odd - but are the best part!), the new fried fish sandwhich (just in time for lent!) and the steak salad (they use real steak - and it has all the pgh fixins, but not too overloaded that you forget you ordered a salad!) YUM!!!!"}
