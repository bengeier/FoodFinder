{"text":"Decor and concept is great - I love freshly prepared food.  The service is very good, the staff are always very friendly.    The portions will initially look small on the plate but once you start eating it it fills you up quickly.  Everything tastes fresh. The only downside is that it can get quite pricey - Sandwich, soup/salad, drink will often cost about $17.    Usually I'm pretty full after a meal, but I've come back a few times just for the gelato.  Their hazelnut gelato is my favourite, but they usually have about 10-12 other varieties which you can try before making a choice."}
{"text":"I stopped by for the Gelato - it was excellent. Nice and smooth the way good Gelato should be.  They have about 10 choices which alternate regularly. I tried the double chocolate and loved it. They will offer you the opportunity to try all the flavours before you buy. Stick with the small, the portion size is huge.  Staff here are awesome! Incredibly polite and friendly. They offered lot's of samples to get people to try new things. They openly engaged in friendly banter and I enjoyed discussing the menu with them - rare in a fast food place.   Love the look of the restaurant and the big orange chairs are so comfortable. If only they served beer.... I may never leave.  Food menu is primarily sandwiches, soups and salads, kind of like Panera bread. Will try next time and update my review.  BK"}
{"text":"Ordered a Hazelnut ice-cream and a cookie and a broccoli cream soup. Came to about $10. Ice-cream and cookie was okay but nothing special worth noting. Soup was pretty good with semi melted cheese which gave the soup a nice taste and texture."}
{"text":"Maybe, just maybe I went to Fresh A Fare on a bad day?! Or was it my bad day?  It was Happy Schnitzel Day ($9.74), of course I want to give it a try. Schnitzel Sandwich topped with grilled Veggie and Mushroom Sauce was really really salty. My Signature Cheeseburger Soup though quite interesting but was super salty too! I ended up could not even finished half of my lunch, I just could not do it!  The staff though were super friendly and even offer everyone in the restaurant a taste of their carrot cake, which I enjoyed! Maybe I should just have that carrot cake for lunch?!  I might come back for some of their baked goods and sweet.. and even try their house made Gelato.   Maybe, just maybe Fresh A Fare can just take it easy on their use of salt during food preparation. It is healthier that way. Just have some table salt on the side if one prefers to have more sodium in their food...."}
{"text":"This review is based on a quick lunch that includes a breadless sandwich and a chocolate gelato.    I stumbled upon this place thinking I could get a soup and salad lunch.  The picture of a breadless sandwich looked so pretty, so I got one.  How it works is that the customer creates his/her own customized sandwich just like a regular order, except the bread becomes 2 slices of leaves.  The end product looked quite similar to the picture (great - honest advertisement).  The sandwich tasted fresh and delicious, really no complaint about the quality.  Trying to eat a sandwich that has no firm substance holding it together was a different matter.  I tried eating it like a regular sandwich by holding it up by hand; that didn't work out too well since things kept falling out.  I ended up eating it with fork and knife, but cutting a leaf with knife was harder than imagined.  So my verdict was that while the food quality was good, it took practice to master the mechanics to eating it.  I ordered a \"50 Shades of Chocolate\" gelato.  It was rich and smooth.  It was pricey ($7/cup), so I would probably order the classic flavour next time. ($3/scoop).  Service was efficient and polite.  Overall, 4 stars for fresh ingredients and innovative product ideas."}
