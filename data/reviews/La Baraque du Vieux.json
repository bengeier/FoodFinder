{"text":"Most people come to drink, there seems to be a lot regulars but families and tourists also come in. Great location and patio. Bacon Poutine was okay, very pricey because of the location. I think their burger tasted good."}
{"text":"This is the worst place in all of Montreal.  Our server spilled a beer on me and then tried to serve it to my friend at the other table.  She didn't get me anything to clean my table, chair or clothes and then asked if she should get us napkins?  The poutine took forever to come out and was just terrible at best.  She then spilled a glass of water all over my phone and said, \"accidents happen\" and did not even apologize.  If I could give it a 0 stars or less, I would.  Stay away from this place!!!"}
{"text":"Very happy I came across this place while exploring the old city.  It's just off the main drag so the outdoor seating is perfect for those avoiding the crush of the crowds and looking for some (relative) peace and quiet.  The poutine was very good and reasonably priced.    The owner of the place was very personable and made the lunch that much more enjoyable with this witty small talk.  Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this spot after a long day in Montreal. We sat ourselves because no one was paying attention and it took about 20 minutes for someone to finally acknowledge us. We had to ask for menus and then when the waitress finally came over to take our order she seemed very rushed. 3 tables got sat after us and they seemed to having ok service. When we saw one of the tables that got sat after us get their food first we were a little confused. 35 minutes go by and all of the tables that got sat after us are eating their food so we tried to call over our waitress and she kept ignoring us. We get a hold of her 20 minutes later and then ask her how much longer for our food and she says, \"what did you order again?\" She had no idea what we ordered and never placed it into the computer. So after an hour of waiting for 3 sandwiches she finally decides to enter the order into the computer. During this whole time she never came up to us or check on our order. We got up and decided to leave and just pay for our drinks. Her excuse for this was it got busy. She never apologized either. Will never be coming back and if I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Really amazing poutine! The owner was really nice, and food was amazing. In a really nice location, and a cute little hole in the wall!"}
{"text":"Good place for poutine-tried Montreal and Quebec- and both were very good and decently portioned. Cozy atmosphere with good music, only downside was they did not provide tap water. Strongly recommended for tourists looking for poutine!"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the unpretentious exterior. It is worth your time. I had a luscious vegetarian omelette here. It also came with very fresh fruit and potatoes. It was far superior to the cardboard-quality veggie omelet (and less-than-fresh fruit) that I had the day prior at a Maggie Oaks. My hub and I had been to La Baraque earlier in the week for a late pizza and wine. Again- very good. The wait staff are helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Missing the beat here. Our waiter had BO. The poutine Montreal was good but was scarce with the corned beef. Good section of local beer- 2 for $9 happy hour."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place for a quick bite to eat during my first visit to Montréal with my boyfriend. After realizing that most restaurants close early during the winter, meaning around 8:00 PM we settled for dinner in the tourist area and since I have never tried poutine we stepped into here. It was a cold and snowy night, Montréal by my impression must close early and so we were the only customers. Despite that, our server was attentive and I had a great poutine - it looked like a small portion at first but I soon realized I could barely finish it. I had the original poutine with gravy, cheese curds, and some ham and boyfriend had the chicken poutine - the food came out hot and we were in and out of there within an hour. We also had a great conversation with our server about life in Montréal and I could tell he was happy to have our company in the quiet restaurant that night. I would come back here."}
{"text":"Service is great here and it's tucked away from the bustle of the street, and the poutine was great the fries were hot and crispy and I had a burger and it was really good! My husband and I enjoyed our nice quiet lunch here today:) j would come back again their food is good and the server was very friendly!"}
