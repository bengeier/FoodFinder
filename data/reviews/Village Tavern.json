{"text":"First , I wish to thank Brian, (the manager ) he's awesome. We had a small issue when we first got there he took care of it immediately. The meal was great.  The next day we went back for dinner the rib eye was delicious and the desserts were to die for ! Next time we're in town we definitely will be back. Again thank you Brian."}
{"text":"Fantastic HappyHour in a cozy lounge. Incredible menu and reasonably priced for the area. Try the chilled sampler plate !  Can't wait to get back"}
{"text":"Salads today.  Caesar and Greek.  One with salmon and the other with grilled shrimp.  They've got a beautiful crisp Rose not on the menu which goes perfectly with the shrimp."}
{"text":"Nice enough place once inside but the two things I ordered were surprisingly weak. I ordered the Cobb salad and it was probably the worst example of this typical entreè salad I've ever had. It was literally soaked in average blue cheese dressing - think slop. Everything was chopped up and mixed together soaked in dressing.  Then I decided to order the \"spring rolls\" hoping it would be better and giving them a chance to redeem themselves in my opinion - oh well that didn't happen! Think American style egg rolls with 3 different incredibly average dipping sauces.  So lesson learned - pleasant walk to the restaurant but the food is badly executed. The service at the bar though was fine no complaints - friendly and complete. The kitchen and the implementing of dishes is where the failures lie."}
{"text":"I work in the Rotunda building so I go to Village Tavern for lunch occassionally.  The food is just okay - nothing spectacular but nothing awful; I guess I'd say it's average.  Last time I went I had the crab cake sandwich which was sort of bland and soggy; the time before that I ordered a salad which was also just average.    Their service is good and it always seems to be busy during lunchtime.  The patio IS nice if you're having a drink or just want to hang out with friends.     Village Tavern is not a terrible place but it wouldn't be my first choice for dining."}
{"text":"wow. brian reserved table #7 for us at 6:30 on a very busy friday night.   wow, wow...tiffany rocks!  tiffany treated us like visiting dignitaries or - say it with me: rock stars.... she recommended the super steak nachos. they were superb.  my prime rib, broccoli, spinach, and mashed 'taters were perfect.  my excellent rock star wife's chicken marsala, green beans, and mashed 'taters were perfect. she liked the generous pour of her chardonnay.   wow, wow, wow.... mom's shrimp scampi was perfect. mom was very happy - again. a very rare occurrence, but the norm when we take her to village tavern.   our chocolate torte and mom's \"world's smallest\" sundae were wonderful.   we had a great time, never felt rushed, and paid a reasonable fare for our fare: $110 for three meals, two desserts,  two glasses of wine, two root beers, and a huge appeazatizer. all of us had luscious leftovers today."}
{"text":"Update: my boyfriend and I have been to Village Tavern about 10x since our first visit which I initially reviewed. I'm obsessed with the Rainbow Trout and he loves the Meatloaf and Pork Chops (I'm Pescatarian so I didn't taste the meat items). He also had the steak and really enjoyed that. I think the vegetarian burger is great and better than the majority I've tried. I've had the crab cake entree a few times so I enjoyed that too. My boyfriend has gotten the wedge salad a couple times and he rarely gets salads."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! We were in Scottsdale for work last week and got a referral from a coworker to come here.  Very glad we took his advice.   I had prime rib and it was perfect.  Coworker had the rib eye and cooked to perfection. Salads and veggies were prepped and served well. Drinks were mixed well and my glass was always kept full. Their selection of beer and wine is very good."}
{"text":"My friend and I were hellbent on going to restaurant A. It's closed. After standing in their parking lot for 10 min we decided on the Village Tavern. She was more familiar with the place than I was. We walked in, sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by a friendly bartender. The woman sitting next to us, however, kept demanding his attention. Every time we started to ask a question or even order our first drink all we heard was \"Blah Blah Blah\" and our bartender was gone. A little frustrating. She quickly left and he was all ours! Our martini's were large and made perfectly. We order a couple appetizers (chilled sampler and the crab cake sliders, minus the bun). The chilled sampler was surprising. For the price there was quite a bit on there, and really good. The smoked salmon was definitely smoked! The sauces that came with the dish complimented the items perfectly, and I'm not a sauce person. The crab cakes were good, not incredible. They were served with a plain tartar sauce.   Next we order the chicken tacos off the regular app menu. Holy CRAP! These were the best chicken tacos I've ever had! What a perfect blend of seasoned (to perfection) chicken, guac, and lime crema with a tasty salsa. WOW! Three tacos come on the plate - it's more than a meal.   I was surprised at the reasonable prices, especially for the amount of food and the quality. Although our trip started out really crappy, it ended on a good note and we will be back."}
{"text":"We went after going to see holiday lights at McCormick Stillman on my son's birthday. Had a great waitress Sheena  food was really good too. Had the spinach dip appetizer which was excellent. My husband had the French onion soup which was recommended by other reviews said it good. I had the chicken Marsala very good and just the right portion. Kid menu is awesome. Kids can get a prime rib for a great price wish I could have ordered off the kid menu haha. My son had the cheese pizza from the kid menu it was huge could have been shared by my other kids. Sheena even brought my son a birthday sundae. The rest of us had the warm butter cake which if you go here is a must.  Totally to die for. I will for sure be back. Great service and food."}
{"text":"Top notch food. Very good service. Get the meatloaf-best I've ever had! Wasn't sure after reviewing a few mixed reviews but really glad we went!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Multiple male servers standing around, place is not very busy on a Saturday afternoon. Had to flag the server down for a refill after waiting 15 mins, it's been another 15 mins and have not seen the waiter yet. Check please!"}
{"text":"Great meal and excellent service. Michelle made us feel welcome and was always there at the perfect time. will go back:)"}
{"text":"I visited this place last month and it was great! I have been before they renovated it and would consider is average. Now that the menu and decorations have been updated, this place is great! I had 2 items from the appetizers- the calamari and the scallops. She had the veggie burger. We split the apple crumble with ice cream dessert. ALL WERE EXCELLENT! The scallops had a teriyaki sauce and there were 3 large scallops on the plate. The calamari came with some kind of sauce but I changed it to a marinara which was good. The dessert was huge, fresh, and the ratio of ice cream to cake was perfect. DEFINITELY COMING BACK!!"}
{"text":"Nella mia visita a Phoenix, i miei amici mi portano a cena al Village Tavern. Luci soffuse, arredi in legno tradizionali, ma un'ottima cucina. Ho assaggiato il filetto di manzo in salsa madera che è stato una meraviglia! Carne tenerissima che si tagliava con la forchetta. Ottimo l'antipasto: un quarto d'insalata Iceberg con salsa al blue cheese (gorgonzola). Per concludere una buona fetta di cheesecake al limone. Se passate di qui, è un ottimo posto per provare la moderna cucina Made in USA."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the food is top notch. One of my favorite places to go for a great steak. Their Filet Mignon is fantastic. I don't take advantage of it enough but the bar has a great, cheap happy hour as well."}
{"text":"It was a nice location and pretty good food.    Be sure to make a reservations for a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Reliably wonderful  We took my 80-something in-laws here on Friday and it was reliably wonderful.  We made a reservation on opentable.com, and didn't have to wait at all, even though we were a little early.  The staff was great at accommodating our request not to have the seniors walk too far.  We had a great table and wonderful service.  We started with a bruschetta, great tomatoes and unusual with capers, and moved on to our next courses:  meatloaf (excellent with a marsala gravy and al dente green beans--plenty for 2 people), a pizza, fish & chips and a soup/salad combo.  My mother-in-law ate more than I'd ever seen her eat before, which was great as she has a poor appetite.  We took our leftovers home and enjoyed them the next day.  We'll be back and it won't be so long between visits from now on!"}
{"text":"The best ribeye i ever eat! My wife and i appreciated this place. Good food and good service. A must try!"}
{"text":"Spinach salad with chicken is my favorite food here. Add in the crab dip as an appetizer and I am a happy girl. When I lived close the the Village Tavern, I went once a week. We also loved the trout and their hamburgers. The one is Scottsdale was filled with retirees and it made me sad. It may not be a place to be seen, but for a chain, its good."}
{"text":"Awful. Terrible. There is not one good thing to say about this place.  We had a party of four. All 4 of our meals were overlooked.  We had 3 orders of crispy chicken tacos and the chicken was so burned that we couldn't even cut into it.  My chicken Colorado was burned to a brick. Awful. The waiter never came back to check on the food after the food runner dropped it off. All of the orders were burned and cold. It took an hour to be served after placing our order. After dinner we moved to the bar to have a drink and the bartender was HORRIBLY rude.  Awful.  Dear owners....Please just give up and close.  They obviously don't care.  Do not waste money here.  We finally walked out."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today for the first time and it will be a one and done. The service was lack luster, the tablecloth had food smeared on it and the crab cake I had was tasteless. You have to work at it to make crab tasteless. My son's burger sounded great on the menu, but the huge glop of some kind of semi melted cheese on top rendered it so visually unappetizing he left half of it. It's a shame it was so bad because the atmosphere is really nice."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and am finally reviewing.  The food is consistent and great.  I can't remember ever having a bad meal here.  They update the menu enough and are adding new items, that I never get tired of going there.  We really enjoy the patio, weather permitting, to sit back, relax, have a few drinks and just enjoy ourselves.  It's a little oasis up there.  It's pretty amazing to me that they've been around as long as they have, and that they are not resting on there reputation (ie: getting lazy).  I've seen numerous restaurants that just get lazy after 8 years or so.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"We tried Village Tavern for lunch. The sweet potato fries were excellent, but the burger left much to be desired. I ordered my burgers Medium and it came out on the rare side of medium rare. Half price glasses of wine made up for it though."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences we have had in a long time.  The sever was more interested in clearing off empty tables then checking to see if we needed any thing.  When we asked for more salad dressing he was gone for so long we wondered if he had to make more by himself.  The chicken in the chicken Thai salad was dry and hard.  To top everything off we asked to speak to the manager to let her know off our disappointments all she could say was \" I am sorry\".  She never made any attempt to make the situation better.  Obviously poor training for management and for waitstaff."}
{"text":"I have been to the Village Tavern several times.  The environment is nice and offers a good location for a lunch or dinner business meeting with a moderate pricetag.  The food overall is great.  I have had a couple things on the menu that ended up being bland.  The Asian chicken salad had no flavor whatsoever.  I've heard that their pizzas are hit and miss.  Other items on the menu have had better reviews. The service has always been attentive."}
{"text":"disappointed that this is the second time, in 20 years that we've voiced a complaint to the manager, and he addressed it by avoiding the issue. as regulars at other establishments, the manager wants to make sure that the diners are happy. at village tavern, apparently business is so stellar, they don't care."}
{"text":"The staff here is top notch. They're friendly and very accommodating. I've never had a bad meal here. If you sign up, you'll get a free dessert or appetizer for your birthday AND anniversary. Love this place."}
{"text":"Servers very accommodating in preparing cocktail not on menu.  Very extensive menu.  My salad was perfect.  Partners was good.  Problem:  at least for us the music (noise).  I can handle most noise if it's low enough .  Theirs was loud enough to dance to.  And mostly ugly.  I tried to dance to it since I thought that was what it was for.  Frowns.  .  This not the only place that tries to outdo the attempted conversations with loud noise they call music.  We try to avoid them as we will do with VT from now on.    Upon entering we suggested to them that the noise could be turned down.  If they thought they did, well, they didn't.  When the music?  Makes me nervous it's time to depart.  When they can accommodate us with lower volume in the noise dept. they can call me at 602 570 4707 and let me know.  Otherwise, bye bye.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Impressed!  I was visiting from Las Vegas for a horse show and this restaurant was recommended to me.  A big thank you to my friends for that!  Amazing service.  Couldn't have asked for anything better!  The food came out in perfect order.  We had appetizers, salad, entrees.  Our drinks were never empty.  The Ahi Sashimi was delicious, my special order salmon done perfect and the prime rib and shrimp scampi my fellow diners ordered was raved about.  I will visit again next time I'm in town!  A+"}
{"text":"Village Tavern is one of my favorite places to go for lunch in Charlotte. They basically cater to all, so you can always find something for everyone here - and they've got a great selection of salads and sandwiches. It's a good place to meet friends for lunch and catch up, and getting a booth seat makes the experience more intimate."}
{"text":"I like this place atmosphere, location, and food options...the only problem I encounter is the wait staff. Every server I've had has had some sort of attitude or annoyed impatience. I try to give this place multiple chances and went back again after at least a year break because I do like it!- and still the same (even different server). It would take amazing great food to make me have to put up with someone's attitude-I'm also paying for the experience."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a couple of friends for happy hour at Village Tavern last night.  Located in the struggling Gainey Village Shopping center at Doubletree and Scottsdale Rd. Poor little high end dining and shopping center struggling along.  VT has always held it's own as a go to place for happy hour and dinner. The mini bar plates cover a range of food. We had Fillet Mignon  sliders (2 to a plate), pulled pork nachos, and Thai shrimp (4 per plate). Overall, everything was a little too oily. Oily tastes good for a minute. The flavors were good but the oil kept me from eating the whole plate. I think these items could be made a bit lighter and still be great.  I have had the cold sampler here before and it was very good. Sometimes we just can't resist the bad stuff.  Nice pour on the Grey Goose! I think Grey Goose should have a special of it's own since there was so much gray hair! A great place to take your parents for dinner. Seriously!  I am at the cross-over age group.  Lori was our server and she was terrific! The service in general was very friendly and attentive.   VT is pretty full by 6 every night. A true neighborhood bar with a friendly staff and a regular crowd. Always fun to get there early and mess up the \"regulars\" seats.  They had some smooth jazz on Tuesday which was nice. Performed by a local girl An Alum from Cocopah Middle School near by. Great style and sound.   VT is worth a stop! A very nice place to relax after work."}
{"text":"Don't be alarmed this place is attached to a hotel! The food and drinks was delicious (omg those little muffins they give you) the servers were all amazing although they tried to take my plate at least four times before I was finished eating... But all in all a wonderful place!"}
{"text":"The GREATEST menu on earth... I've tried many menu items and they have all been exceedingly good. Try the warm butter cake for dessert!!!! Amazing."}
{"text":"Very run-of-the-mill, solid, nothing-exciting-or-surprising type of place. It's the kind of restaurant that's not your first choice, but when all your other options are closed, or too far, or too crowded, you come to Village Tavern and you end up not being disappointed.  I was there today and had the $3 mimosas with the crab-cakes benedict. The potatoes that accompany the eggs are way too mealy, but the eggs themselves and the sauce are spot-on. Wished the crab-cake had a bit more flavor.  Bread service is by request only, which I really like.  Our hostess and our server were polite and efficient.   Overall, a good place to bring mom and dad to on a lazy Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food!  We had the spinach dip for an appetizer. It was nothing special and very oily. I had the crab cakes for my entree. They were the consistency of tuna salad with a little crust on the outside from pan-frying. A very bad excuse for crab cakes. My husband had a burger, which was decent. He ordered the Mac & Cheese for his side and it was terrible. Really soupy and had a strange flavor. Almost like there was mayonnaise in it. He didn't even eat it, and he will usually eat any Mac & cheese. We ordered gluten free pasta with butter and Parmesan for my son and the pasta was crunchy and stuck together. The only good thing we had was the broccoli side for him. We left the meal feeling gross.  Had some cocktails which were fine. On a positive note, our server was good.  On the drive home, we joked, \"At least it was only $100!\"  Yes, $100 for a bad meal.   Will never go back and do not recommend."}
{"text":"I recently visited The Village Tavern in Charlotte. We dined outside on the terrace and listened to great entertainment while supping on absolutley delicious food!   I had the steak which was perfect! My daughter had some wonderfully prepared fish. Our wait-person, Latisha, was a stellar server! Prices were reasonable.  This is a great place to remember when you are waiting in line to get in at the latest 'trendy' restaurant in South Park... it's half the wait for twice the experience!"}
{"text":"So I've been at the Village Tavern restaurant a few times.  For some reason today we did not have the best service.  Our food was delicious and the outside dining was excellent,  but we had to wait over 30 minutes just for our appetizers.  Our first waitress was not very pleasant so they sent us a new,  friendlier waiter.  I'm hoping our next dining experience here will be better."}
{"text":"Went later afternoon on a Saturday.  We happen to hit happy hour and it was awesome.  I had the Sangria ($7.00) and the BBQ ribs ($8.95).  Husband had a Guinness and pulled pork tacos.  For small plates, they were still decent portions.  The Sangria was some of the best I've ever had.  If a restaurant has sangria, I will try it so I've drank my fair share.  What I really liked about this place was the staff. No matter who walked by they filled a water glass, took dirty plates away, etc. it actually seemed liked they enjoyed working there.  Amy was our main gal and she was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, I am giving this place 2 stars. As I arrived the place looked nice and inviting. Unfortunately our service was not. The establishment is uneducated on the liquor laws and identification cards. When my daughter went to hand the waitress her ID for a glass of wine the waitress without reading it was extremely rude. Stating she could not accept old IDs. This is true but my daughter had only turned 21 one week prior and according to law she has to use the old ID for up to 30 days and receive a new one asap. She has been accepted everywhere including old town Scottsdale bars and clubs. Even visited the DMV to confirm. Rolled her eyes at my family and claimed to get a manager and never did. It is not the case that my daughter could not receive her drink even if they were wrong, it was the way the waitress went about it. Very unfortunate and we are not likely to return. Food was just okay."}
{"text":"Really good place great food and drinks at bar and really nice hostess- I would look for Brittany to assist you"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had a wonderful late lunch today and everything was perfect! From the service to the food, everything was top notch. I haven't been there for many years. I pretty much forgot about it. It's so out of sight. We will definitely have to make it a regular destination from now on. Next time we'll have to sit outside, weather permitting."}
{"text":"I went here for a business lunch. Was able to get seated right away and the food was delicious.  The server, Amber, was as cute as a button and very attentative. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch this past Sunday and although it was fairly slow, it was worth the wait. Amazing bacon and brie omelet... the bacon is still on my mind! And toour surprise, the prices were less than similar places in the area... Would recommend for a Sunday brunch even though most people think of this place as a lunch/dinner spot. Only complaint was that the coffee was a little weak... but its definitely on our regular brunch spot list now."}
{"text":"Great food Great Service Great Atmosphere As a person who travels often I dine out a lot. It was refreshing to got to a place that is casual with great food. Our server was attentive and it was a great experience.  Thank you"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time at Village Tavern.  I was in for a treat.  The calamari was good.  My friends who had been there several times ordered a burger with sweet potato fries and a mixed salad with the salmon.  Although I thought I would go for the crab cakes I settled for the Thai chicken nachos.  That was not a small plate although listed in the small plate and appetizer section. Definitely can be shared.    Now the best part was the dessert.  The warm butter cake!!!!!  I would go back just to eat that cake.  Oh, I will be back.  We shared it and no one bothered with the ice cream.  We moved it to the side and focused on the cake and berries.  Simply delicious!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and wine selection.  The spicy Shanghai Calamari was incredible.  The prime rib was cooked to perfection and the warm butter cake a great end to the evening!"}
{"text":"Brunch at the Village Tavern was recommended to us as we just moved here from Cali. The French Toast had a delicious vanilla taste to it that I really enjoyed. I didn't care for the \"hash browns\" that it was served with. They definitely weren't hash browns, they were more like dinner potatoes. The side of Applewood Smoked Bacon was pretty good. My hubby had Southern Shrimp and Grits, which were good but very buttery. He devoured it.   We enjoyed our mimosas on the patio under the bright yellow umbrellas on a Sunday afternoon. I deducted a star because of our server. We had to constantly call for her attention since she never checked on our table and she was short when talking to us.  Overall nice atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here after our favorite happy hour spot had a 45 minute wait. The environment was nice, clean and there were tables at the bar open. They did not have the drink that I asked for but offered another one, which was actually good. The food was good but my main issue was that my credit card was charged for my meal and my neighbors table placing a significant amount of money on hold in my bank account after I let the waitress know of her giant mistake, which as it was my first night ever trying this place did not impress me."}
{"text":"I've been to this chain in Miami and my family loves it. This location served good drinks but the food was just okay."}
{"text":"Just wanted to say we tried out Village tavern again since my last review and the service defiantly has improved. Looks like they had a turn over in servers and have a bunch of attentive and nice workers! We even saw the manager out on the floor.  The food was good, still slow for the salads we ordered this time- but the food was good so it didn't matter, glad we have them another chance thanks Village Tavern!"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of Scott waiting on me three times now. I've decided he is better than your food. The food, by the way, is great. Just thought you should know how much I enjoy the food and service at your restaurant."}
{"text":"I have always found the food here to be decent, but nothing too exciting.  They have a large menu containing items, from soups and salads to steak and pizza.  I have had many of the items and usually like what I have, but it is never anything crave worthy.  The best two things on the menu in my opinion are the meatloaf (weird I know, but it is good) and the Steak Au Poivre.  This is not a place that I usually would choose to go to, but if I end up there, the meal is always decent.  The service is spotty depending on who your server is, sometimes we great bread, sometimes we don't, those sorts of things.  But if you are looking for a menu that would appeal to a wide variety of tastes, this would work."}
{"text":"For the 2nd year in a row we decided to go to Village Tavern for our annual BellSouth/AT&T Christmas luncheon. We reserve the heated tent on the patio.  It's so festive, plenty of room for seating and mingling.  We had an option to have a set menu or order from the menu.  We had close to 60 people so we were informed it may take a little longer to get our food if we didn't do the set menu since everything is done from scratch.  Well that didn't happen, we took our chances and ordered from the menu!  The wait staff - Melissa, Brittany, Kevin and another gentleman that I'm sorry I didn't get his name were excellent!!  We needed for nothing!  We all ordered from the menu and it took no time for us to get our food and everything was hot and absolutely delicious!  I heard not one bad comment about anything.  Jenn stayed in constant contact with me about our reservation because the numbers kept going up on attendance.  I had the pleasure of meeting her when I first got there.  James Ragin/General Manager came out and introduced himself as well.  Everyone was constantly checking on us to make sure everything was up to our standards - the space, room temperature, food, beverage.  You couldn't ask for a more professional staff.  Everything was EXCELLENT!!  I highly recommend Village Tavern either for a small lunch or dinner and a large group like we had.  We'll be back next year for sure! GREAT job Village Tavern!  Thank you for everything, including your staff for taking such good care of us.  You made us feel so special!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good experience eating at the village tavern. The hot crab dip was amazing. I am from Maryland and it is probably one of the best I've tried! The pita bread that was included was hot and paired great with the dip. My entree came out and it was not hot so I sent it back with no problem. The second time it was better. I ordered the kids salmon for my toddler and it taste good! It was a very large portion that I could eat myself. The location is a little hard to find, but besides that it was a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"The Village Tavern is a beautiful restaurant in the heart of Scottsdale, not too far from Old Town.  The menu has many very attractive offerings and a large elegant bar area for waiting.   I've dined at the Tavern twice, once with poor results and thought I would try it again, any restaurant can have an off night, right?  Well, two off nights months apart note a trend that is typically an accurate reflection of the restaurant.   On both occasions, a member of my party ordered a steak, first time it was a New York with bearnaise sauce and the second time, a filet mignon with a horseradish sauce. Both times the steaks were ordered medium well done, not my style, but one in my dining party.  On both occasions the steaks were initially served rare to medium rare, extremely red (not pink) in the middle. A steak is something that is fairly straight forward to cook and if a line chef cannot accurately gauge the doneness of meat, then what other mistakes are being made in the kitchen and more so, what is so difficult about cooking a steak?  I mean, if your a professional chef this should be cooking school 101, right?    So, for the price of a NY at $30 bucks plus sides and the sauce, which puts a plate price around $40 bucks, your much better off at one of the myriad of other \"fine\" dining establishments in Scottsdale.  To think of a few, Cowboy Ciao, Roaring Fork, Citizen's Public House and the list goes on and on...think twice before dropping some coins in this deposit box."}
{"text":"Love the Village Tavern.. great Scottsdale location, not too far from Old Town. The fettuccine alfredo is a great size for lunch, and the sweet potato fries are better than I have had at many restaurants. Outside seating available.. very clean property, and the staff is friendly. Will return."}
{"text":"New Favorite = Crispy Chicken Sandwich!! Our first visit to the Village Tavern was fantastic. The menu offers different flavors on old favorites. The food is delicous, fast and the service was great. Exactly what I expect when I go out to eat. The restaurant is also clean and beautiful, the type of place I like spending time in. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"GF and I went here for happy hour in the bar, the food and drink and fellow patrons were great, but the service really sucked. 10 minute wait for everything. Manager took empty beer bottle without offering a refill. Staff stands around chatting among themselves, when customers are trying in vain ti get their attention.  You literally have to beg to be served here. We won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, good crafted cocktails, and nice atmosphere.  Several vegetarian and vegan options. (Could always have more: hint)."}
{"text":"Food is good and the service is prompt. The servers could use more personality though. Kinda dry and formal."}
{"text":"Food was average, very surprised that they did not give a military discount for veterans. One of the waiters rolled his eyes at us and did not make us feel welcomed."}
{"text":"I had lunch here the other day after having not been here in years... it certainly hasn't changed.  On a cold day, it was nice to retreat into the woody warmth of Village Tavern, and although it was pleasantly bustling with the business lunch crowd, we still scored a nice table.  I really do like the atmosphere, and in nice weather, the patio is where it's at.  They have a number of vegetarian dishes, all of which are helpfully marked.  I had the house-made veggie burger, which wasn't memorable but was certainly better than a frozen patty from a box.  In my view, they tried to make it a little too much like a burger burger and forgot that veggie burgers should be developed and enjoyed on their own merits.  Next time, I'll order sans lettuce, tomato, and mayo.  Still, it was a nice place for a work lunch, and since they have several veg. options, I imagine I'll be back for lunch in the future."}
{"text":"The food, service, and ambience was great. I highly recommend the warm butter cake.  Absolutely delicious!  We had the large prime rib and asked for an extra plate.  They split it for us and it was the best and perfect size.  The meat was perfectly cooled and the au jus was very flavorful.   HIGHLY recommend this place.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food with lots of choices. Can even bring the grandkids. Fast and friendly service with lots of attention from the wait staff.  From date night, small gathering to family friendly. Atmosphere has you wanting to come back soon...and we do!"}
{"text":"Had a nice atmosphere, quick service, great steaks, and prime rib. Staff was great! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"On my way home from a late golf session at McCormick Ranch, I decided to stop at the Village Tavern. I had driven by it for years, but never stopped in to see what they offered. I wanted to try some place different, so decided to give it a go.  Since I was by myself, I immediately went to the bar for liquid refreshment. Not a great selection of beer, but they did have several choices, so all was not lost.  I did decide to try something to eat, but since I wasn't overly hungry, I opted for a pizza. I was surprised - it was quite good for a \"bar\" pizza, and something I would order again. On a subsequent visit I had the fish tacos, which were also quite good.  I'm not a meat and potatoes person, but there were a number of choices on the menu that I am waiting to try.  However, it always seems that when I stop by, I'm more in a snacking mood than looking for a full dinner. But their menu is solid, and I will try a full meal when the mood hits.  A nice place, and I wouldn't hesitate to bring out of town visitors here."}
{"text":"First time there.  It was fabulous! We sat at the bar and Maddie was our server and she is wonderful.  The food was incredible!  Definitely 5+stars!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for the first time.  Have to say the place was just alright and nothing spectacular. The hot crab dip was awesome. We literally scraped the bowl! I had the shrimp and grits....it's was ok. Not the best I have ever had and this was due to the thick grits....just wasn't all that great. I had a side of asparagus which was seasoned well. My boyfriend had the ribeye with sautéed spinach and mashed potatoes. He said the ribeye was ok and not the best he has had. But the sides were great.  The ambience was not really my style....but it was decent. I think I would probably come back....maybe....no guarantees"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our recent visit here.  We decided to do a last minute road trip for Memorial Day Weekend from OC, CA to Scottsdale, AZ.  My husband has been to the Village Tavern before but many years ago, telling me that the prime rib is really good.  We went around lunch time and were quickly seated at a booth, we were warmly greeted, the restaurant is large but homely and warm feeling.  Everything seemed clean and well maintained.  Our server John was great, very friendly and attentive.   We ordered the clam chowder and french onion soup to start, both were great but the clam chowder was really good.  We both ordered the prime rib, I had the smaller one with mash potatoes and sauteed spinach, my husband ordered the larger portion with fries and green beans.  Both we asked for medium rare.  Food came out promptly but immediately we could see the steaks were more medium well than medium rare but we know that it is difficult to cook perfectly.  The steaks were seasoned well but did taste more cooked than we would normally like it to be.  The mash potatoes and fries were great.  The spinach and green beans were both over salted but more so the spinach - they were inedible.   We very casually explained to John when he asked us how our food was that the spinach was too salty, he apologized, spoke to the kitchen manager and they gave us my orange juice on the house.  We felt that was a nice gesture and were happy with that.  For dessert we ordered the warm butter cake....oh boy, simply to die for! It was so good, if we weren't so full we would have ordered another!  Overall we really enjoyed our dining experience and would definitely recommend it to others and go back ourselves if we are ever in the area again"}
{"text":"Outstanding first experience. Had company in town and this was recommended by a friend! Surpassed my expectations by a mile! Food was phenomenal, service was customer-centric! Totally WOW'ed!"}
{"text":"I did end up returning at the request of a friend and was treated very differently upon making my second request for a reservation. Thank you for being beyond gracious, kind and helpful the second time around! Sincerely appreciated!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here yesterday and when you walk in, it feels like you've left Scottsdale and are in a cabin. The menu was mostly breakfast and a shortened lunch however they accommodated to my sweet mother-in-law the fish and chips even though it wasnt listed. The service was friendly and professional. I ordered something I never do, the Monte Cristo with a salad and every bite was better than the last. Tried my husbands mac n cheese and almost died of happiness.  All in all, it was thw best meal I've had in awhile. I thoroughly enjoyed the setting, the beautiful bustling open kitchen and the fantastic service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Do you remember the old Seinfeld episode...\"they are good at taking reservations, but not keeping reservations\"...well that is the story here.  After waiting almost two hours beyond our scheduled time, they sat us.  The food was no better than average.  We did not leave the place saying, \"wow that food was great, I can't wait to try it again.  This was my first time here and likely my last.  As I read some of the other reviews I can see that my service was not out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Though this restaurant can be a little hard to find, it is well worth it. My wife and I literally just had one of the best meals we've had since we can't remember when. Dip Duo, mixed salad, Colorado Chicken, Filet, vegetables ... Wine ... All were excellent! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Have been eating lunch here on Wednesdays for years.  (Wednesday being half price wine day).  Excellent salads, especially the Tavern House salad.  The burgers are out of this world.  Try the bacon cheddar burger and you won't be disappointed.  No overcooked, dried out burgers here.  I order mine medium rare and it's always cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Was there for MOther's Day last night and still great food! I ordered the filet medallions with marsala sauce and mushrooms - yummy! Consistently good food and good service! Having been in the restaurant industry for years, I know how hard it is to get it right!"}
{"text":"Pretty OK.  Visited several times.   Been for lunch (roast beef really good).   Bar scene is nice, rustic-type atmosphere.  Had office group & several plates of all the different appies to nosh on, was good.   Martinis are 'ok', same goes for glasses of wine.   Good for an after work sorta thing."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice restaurant with good food that has an American Tavern feel, this is your place. When I sat down I was greeted quickly, and when I had questions about a wine I was looking for, they sent over a very knowledgeable gentleman who helped find two excellent wines. My party had everything ranging from salad, scallops, clam chowder, ribs, pizza and prime rib.  Everything was very good, the only thing that really stood out as being exceptional was the prime rib.  Very nice thick cut, served with a warm au jus and some creamy horse radish, cooked perfectly, YUM.  Their menu is large enough that there is always something for everyone."}
{"text":"We had dinner at this place twice. The service was exceptional both times. Dinner portions are very big and well prepared. We loved their kale salad, burger, and potato leak soup."}
{"text":"Funniest dinner service ever!  I know that sounds odd but it's true.  5 of us dined here on a Saturday for dinner, drinks and food was ordered.  15 minutes pass by and still no food while an adjacent table is seeing proper timing on food and drink delivery.  Our food finally comes a along with one salad instead of three.  A little off putting so far.  Our waiter apologizes and we are all offered free dessert from the manager.  Dinner continues and drinks are frequently low with little sight of  our server.  The manager is roaming however and like clockwork 60-90 seconds after she walks by, BAM, table service.  Anyway, dessert time, two of us pass and the rest order 2 double decker cheesecakes and a chocolate torte.  Upon presentation we recieve 2 key like pies and 1 torte.  Poor server must be having a nightmare of a day with his manager right now.  So at this point we all five now have dessert and are laughing hysterically at how many times one guy keeps messing up.  Conclusion here was that he must be new so we let all this slide and just enjoy a good laugh at his expense.  I give this a 4 because I couldn't give it a 5 after all the debacles but all 5 entrees were amazing and the dessert was fantastic."}
{"text":"We went there during the sleepy Scottsdale summer, so we were able to get right in.  The food we had was excellent- blackened salmon sandwich w/ homemade chips, kids food was great, margarita pizza was amazing- the crust could be the best I've ever had.  Do yourself a favor and order the crab cake appetizer.... SO GOOD!  The calamari was also excellent, but the Thai chili sauce is what elevates the rather ordinary app to something memorable.  Just get a side of the sauce if you don't want to order of calamari!!  Key Lime Pie was great (better than I've ever made it) and the nutella & chunky monkey stuffed crepes were delicious, not my favorite but devoured non- the- less.  The best dish was the Shrimp & Grits.  Being from California, I don't see this on menus very often, and I like to order new things.  So glad I did.  It was unbelievable.  Shrimp, bacon, Gruyere, grits.... AMAZING!!  Bottom line- obviously we enjoyed the food... but the service and the staff were all very nice, informative & friendly."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal here! Prime Rib was juicy, tender, and perfectly seasoned. We were a party of four who was on the last night of an eight day touring vacation and we all agreed that our dinner here was the best of the week, and we had eaten some excellent meals along the way!"}
{"text":"This place has has always been my favorite place for a long time.  chip n ranch app is great! my favorite filet in town and yes ive had filets at other places high end. ive had plenty of items on the menu to say its all good.  Recently my wife and i would go in on sundays to grab brunch. noticed a lot of the staff there complain more and more. (kinda like im watching the movie Waiting) if your gonna complain go into the kitchen not at the service station for customers to hear.     if the staff stays snotty ill find another sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. From seafood to steak, they always get my order right. Every time I've been here service has been amazing as well. It has become my favorite place for tilapia or steak. Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing patio. Good food and drinks. Great spot to go with a group to enjoy the patio setting"}
{"text":"You're bound to have a great experience once you step foot into the deep woody tones inside of the village tavern. The food is fantastic, rich and well portioned. Their chef, Paul, even comes to Gainey village to do cooking classes. It's a great place to come and celebrate - don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Environment and food ok.  Service was lacking,  Rebecca was server and we asked for some bread when ordering.  Meals arrived and we again asked about bread and was told it was in the oven.  Finishing our meal and asked if bread was out of oven yet ( I noticed another table had gotten bread) and we were asked if we wanted some.  Really?  No, we just wanted to know if it was out of the oven.  Of course we wanted some.  She cleared my friends and wife's plate and left mine sitting.  Finally cleared it when she the brought bread.  Also, did not mention happy hour when we were seated."}
{"text":"Have eaten there many times recently.  Even got a peak at Diane Keaton eating there last Saturday night. The food is generally excellent. The Cowboy Hamburger is fabulous!  Service can be very good but also lacking in attitude and customer service from the younger generation.  I called to make a reservation for lunch with a party of 5, and was told they only take lunch reservations for parties of 6.  I was assured by the girl I spoke with we would have no trouble getting in with our group.  It was good that one person got there early... by the time I arrived (on time at 11:30 a.m.), there was already a wait.  Maybe they should consider taking lunch reservations, too, for everyone.  Prices are fair for the area and Scottsdale.  Wish there was more mid-price range places with excellent food. It seems like Scottsdale is loaded with bar food and high end restaurants.  This one fits the budget and has excellent food.  A reservation is essential for dinner."}
{"text":"Usually we have a good experience here. On this latest occasion I was disappointed with the service. Food was fine but the lack of attentiveness and overall demeanor of the server will prevent me from coming here for quite awhile. What really fries me is when the bussing of the tables is slow. And that was the case here. Also, instead of letting us relax and order drinks the server took our drink and dinner orders at same time. Take the drink order first and let us look at the menus, please. It was a Saturday night (early) and perhaps the staffing was not sufficient."}
{"text":"Always a great meal and terrific service.  Beautiful restaurant and bar with a fantastic outdoor patio.  By far my favorite go to place as it is consistently great."}
{"text":"Upscale but friendly  Unlike some other upscale establishments that seek to differentiate their offerings via some exotic (read:  bizarre) ingredients in their dishes, VT sticks mostly to the classics and focuses on prep and presentation.  Appetizer, salad and entree choices are varied and quality is consistent.  Service usually strikes good balance between attentiveness and letting you relax with your drink or meal.  It's a popular place and the surface parking lot frankly inadequate.  One local access road is currently closed due to a massive construction project nearby.  Certainly not the cheapest but with the maddening similarity between far too many restaurants in the area it's a relief to find a place where the food doesn't taste like another rush job from a microwave, fryer or bain marie.  One might not expect a posh restaurant to draw families with kids but VT's proximity to the mall and residential areas means that the little darlings visit in their droves. The waiting area occasionally resembles a McDonald's PlayPlace with outside voices freely exercised.  For a bit of peace be clever about your time of visit, early or late, and/or sit at the expansive bar."}
{"text":"Busy happy hour, however you wouldn't know it from the great service from Sabrina.  $5 liquor discounted small plates. Enjoyed the atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Village Tavern.  I went on a business lunch with a colleague and client.  The place was pretty busy, which I took to be a good sign.  Not so much.  I ordered the margherita pizza and it was absolutely terrible!  The crust was so hard I couldn't even cut it with my serrated knife.  There was a ton of oil/grease on the pizza and the taste was bland at best.  Definitely the worst margherita pizza I've ever had.  How do you mess up pizza?!  If I didn't have a client with me, I would have complained and ordered something else.  My colleague's food was cold and our client said her lunch was \"so-so\".  Maybe the kitchen was having an \"off day\"?  With all the other choices in the SouthPark area, I don't see me going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Great Sunday brunch. Drinks were lovely as was the meal itself. Our waitress Mary Catherine was the sweetest, most attentive waitress ever. Highly recommend a visit"}
{"text":"Had a great meal.  Service was very good, they have a good happy hour with large selection of beers on tap.  I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed this neighborhood restaurant for many years.  Lately, however, the service and food have become very inconsistent.  In ordering a dish and specifically mentioning no spice and for sure not the spicy sauce.  Well it came with the sauce and when I mentioned to the server, they took it back, wiped off, but still there and unable to eat.  One of the others at the table ordered a wedge salad which never was served. This was not a particularly busy time, so hard to excuse.  The service is very dependent on the server, some are outstanding and some not so much.  We will try again and hope to have a better experience."}
{"text":"I came based on the reviews but was severely disappointed.   We both ordered the prime rib sandwich $12.95, well like they say you get what you pay for.  The meat had ally of fat and had chewy uncomfortable parts in my mouth :(. The person I was with told me they were also disappointed.   We also ordered the bruschetta :(. The tomatoes were freezing cold and he bread blah; I'll defiantly wait for Italy.  Shocked at how many people eat here when Charleston's is so much higher quality and taste.   I know where l'll stick to."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in my last visit here. My family and I have been coming here for brunch and we have seen the quality deteriorate. We gave it another shot, but it reinforced it is time to move on to other places. I ordered the BLT with a fried egg, which has been my favorite in the past. I specifically asked for the bread to be well toasted and crispy because my mom said during her last two visits it was soggy. Despite my request, the bottom piece of bread was mushy and wet. I ended up having to ask for a new piece of toast and had to reassemble it myself. The bacon was not nearly as good as it used to be. Service overall was spotty. It took a long time to get our drinks, and even longer for my fresh piece of toast. Disappointing."}
{"text":"The food and service are usually terrific as long as you don't order asparagus. It is totally unedalble! Every time!"}
{"text":"I ordered the entree spinach salad which is great - and I'd had many times before. It comes with chicken and is again, an entree. After 25 mins, an empty sparkling water bottle and my husbands empty beer - the server brings me a side salad and my husbands sandwich.   I was like hmmm this is tiny and there's no chicken. I'm pregnant and starving (hence the long wait) so I was like leave me the side salad.   He said it doesn't come with chicken but I can get you some - gee thanks!  So kindly, he brings me a plain chicken breast after I've finished my tiny salad. The server is totally oblivious, I'm finished and all of our drinks are still empty due to the ridiculous wait. The person at the table behind us ordered the same salad I ordered, (I had entree envy) so clearly I'm not imagining the salad I've had in the past. So the additional chicken was added to the bill and we paid more than the actual salad I ordered. We would have ordered more beer and pellegrino but that was too much effort to deal with this server any more who is not mindful of the situation. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Tried this place out after moving to the Southwark area and had a craving for prime rib. Placed a pick up order and got there within the 15 minute time frame they gave me. Food was ready, and hostess and bartender taking my order were very nice. Ambiance of the place looks very nice and quiet, so I'd like to return for a sit down dinner one evening. Got my food home and was pretty good. Rib was cooked just the way I like it, medium. You could cut it with a fork! The mac and cheese was good, and the sautéed spinach was good, but a little salty for my taste. Bottom line-you get a good meal for a decent price so I'll go back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice b4 (reminds me due 4 another go~round when out that way again)! My 1st time was more dressed up 4 a business luncheon & my 2nd visit was after work so was dressed far more casually + not feeling well due 2 battling a migraine). Both occasions was treated w/ the same polite, helpful & professionally accomod8ing service!      Both Xs were during the evening tho the 1st trip was earlier & the 2nd was l8r. Had a reserv8ion trip 1 & just showed up the 2nd time (spontaneous decision after a walking out of the Melting pot around the way ~ a l8er review). Regardless, got us seated rather promptly @ a nice comfy booth (which I really needed @ the time cuz I was contending w/ some back issues as well then) + near the cozy fireplace was a nice added bonus!     The ambiance has an inviting homey cabin/cottage~type feel w/ a combin8ion of cobblestone & wooden beam paneling somewhat similar 2 Le Chalet & some Claim Jumper's interior. Romantic, intim8, upscale & @ the same time casual enough 2 not feel out of place if dressed down like I was on my 2nd visit. Luv these kind of atmospheres where anything goes!     I've had the Spinach salad both Xs & I have 2 say as long as they still have it on their menu, I'd make a trip just 4 this alone! It is THAT AWESOME & is the most unexpectedly complimentary combin8ion of flavors, that it is the Absolute BEST salad I've EVER had & I've seriously partaken of countless kinds that couldn't hope 2 even b a contender by comparison!! Spinach salad has grape tom8toes, green apples, dried cranberries, spiced pecans, sliced egg, crumbled blue cheese & bacon w/ poppyseed dressing (Of course there were a couple ingredients I didn't have on mine) but would gladly pay double the price!!      French onion soup is Superb & I can't get enough of their sweet potato fries!! (which I attribute 2 assist in ridding the migraine as I felt much better after having them). Also can't go wrong w/ the bruschetta & the spaghetti squash/zucchini is another gr8 dish 4 Veg~heads as well as their margherita pizza & the fresh or blackened salmon or hot crab dip if ur a pescetarian. They also have a veggie burger which I have yet 2 try & I can't account 4 their other desserts yet, but the Creme Brulee is a savory 4bidden treat! Would come here more often if it were closer 4 me, but I have nothing but glowing remarks 4 this place!!"}
{"text":"Stopped after work Friday evening to meet a buddy of mine.  He is from Greensboro, but had a business meeting in South Park. So I suggested we meet at Village Tavern...a staple in my mind for the great food, drinks and atmosphere.  I moved from South Park in 2012 and was really looking forward to hitting Village Tavern again. Yikes! What a disappointment :(  At 5:30 the patio was practically empty.  But actually, that was great for us to sit down, have a drink and chat.  We chose a table with the umbrella closed on purpose...the weather that evening was awesome.  Unfortunately, no less than three employees, one of which appeared to be a supervisor/manager, came to our table, reached over us WITHOUT ASKING, and opened the umbrella. When we made it clear we did not want it opened, one employee even said something like, \"All of the umbrellas will be opened\".  Basically meaning, \"Regardless that you are a patron who out of all the establishments in South Park, chose Village Tavern after work as your place to unwind, we are going to decide for you whether the umbrella on your table is opened.\"  The last employee who tried this left our table with an attitude...all because we did not want our umbrella opened...really?  It's not as if the patio was clamoring with patrons...there was literally just four other tables with customers when we arrived at 5:30.  We left at 7:00 and still the patio was half empty. Wonder why...this place used to be slammed during happy hour.  I left feeling embarrassed that I chose Village Tavern to \"showcase\" the South Park area.  Thank god for our sever, Laura, who really saved the day with her energetic smile and willingness to please.  She smoothed over the ridiculous actions of her fellow staff members with ease.  A true gem :)  Go Laura!"}
{"text":"Very busy place, so get here early if you want to enjoy the HH specials!  But wow, not many places can beat their house $5 you-call-its!   The happy hour menu changes regularly, I believe, but I ended up getting the house fish and chips from the regular menu which were absolutely amazing! 3 huge pieces of fish were more than I could ever eat, and even their tartar sauce is home made and out of this world!!   Definitely want to go back and try the crab cakes..."}
{"text":"I have no idea why I keep giving this place a chance, food is ok, service is always below average, way too many better options in South Park   Very professional reaching out and trying to correct issues, will give them another shot at some point"}
{"text":"Great filet! Service was great too. My friend ordered the ribeye and was not happy with it. The waiter happily sent it back and the manager even stopped by to make sure we were happy when they brought us another. The cocktails were pretty standard. Not an amazing place, but I would have no problem returning here. It was a good meal."}
{"text":"Awesome burger!    The place looks so great since the renovation!  Great dessert that's new!  Macadamia brownie with gooey Carmel.   And ice cream!   Meatloaf is a great entree as well!  Great staff and awesome head chef!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many, many times in the past 10 years.  Never have I been so disappointed in my experience.   The hostess, a chunky brunette, who smelled like marijuana, was so rude we left and went to Brick Top's!"}
{"text":"One of my 5 favorite restaurants in the state. THE  BEST hamburger and you can actually get it cooked \"Rare\" and it's all pink and not raw! The only place in Arizona where you can get REAL French Onion Soup! Not cheap, but not overpriced, either. Friendly, quiet sports bar type atmosphere, but more upscale crowd and no loud television sets. Comprehensive wine and spirits collection. Where else can you go in blue jeans at 8pm at night and get a prime rib dinner in 10 minutes without the slightest hassle?! And yeah, the bacon wrapped scallops are the bomb! This place is the coolest!"}
{"text":"Village Tavern is a great place to go when you're in the mood for American food. They have a broad variety of appetizers and entrees, and a yummy selection of sandwiches too. The restaurant is insanely cozy, with bubbled glass window panes and a giant fireplace at the head of the main dining room.  Their french onion soup and New York Strip steak are my two favorites. Great place to go when you aren't sure what you're in the mood to eat -- there's so many options at Village Tavern. Naomi Garnice gives it four stars."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I was staying at the Gainey Suites in AZ which is literally right around the corner from this place.  The place is huge...slightly impersonal. but our waitress made up for that vibe. she was very attentive and gave great recommendations. I had the sea bass with sticky rice drizzles with soy sauce and wilted garlic spinach with ginger.  the meal was pretty great....but the stay of it as far as i'm concerned was the spinach. the ginger addition was such a surprise and i LOVED it. so much so that i have been looking up different recipes and takes on this so I can recreate at home. the rice was the perfect consistency and the bass was flaky and flavorful. overall i liked this restaurant a lot!  if you're in the area...definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I was so inspired by my latest visit to VIllage Taven that  I am writing my first Yelp review!  I have been going to VIllage Tavern for years.  My family has always used it for a special place for graduation, birthday, etc dinners.  We went when my sister graduated from law school in August. We made a reservation since we were a large party, and since the table was not ready, we had to sit in the hallway and wait, as many of the older people in our party were uncomfortable sitting at the bar.  Then, they were out of most things on the menu, and the food that we did get was only average.  Not what I had come to expect.  Fast foward to this past Friday night.  We went again to celebrate a friend's graduation from law school.  His family had come from PA, so we wanted to take them somewhere we knew was nice.  We again made a reservation since we were a party of 16.  We got there, the table was not ready, and after some back and forth with the hostess, they wanted us to sit outside in a tent (maybe nice in the summer, but not in December), with plastic chairs and at seperate tables, where there was a loud party going on in the tent already.  We told them we wanted to sit inside and together, so they shuffled us back inside, where we continued to wait on a table.  We were repeatedly told that they were sorry, the party that came before us didn't want to get up, but never once did we see a manager.  The poor hostess was trying her best to accomodate, but we really should have spoken to the manager at this point.  We were finally sat inside (around 10pm, an hour after our reservation) and we were 4 seats short at the table.  They told us that we would have to wait until the table next to us got up, which seemed to be no time in the near future.  So, at this point, most of us are sat, some are standing, and we have been there an hour.    I have to admit, we were given four free appetizers (for the party of 16), and that just didn't make up for the experience.  I think after years of coming to Village Tavern, these two experiences have been my last."}
{"text":"Great service.  Interesting cocktails.  The French onion soup was wonderful.  The Gastropub burger was HUGE and very tasty.  The painkiller cocktail was worth the visit by itself.  We will be back"}
{"text":"I felt so accomplished today to go to a restaurant I bookmarked on Yelp!  I was definitely a happy gal.  The atmosphere is modern contemporary and the bar was happy hour packed.  Kristen the bartender is a doll and pours the perfect amount of wine... enough to make you come back again and again and again.  The happy hour prices were freaking amazing.  Half off glasses of wine!?  Small plates on special!? YES PLEASE!!  We had the hummus which stands out from any you will ever try.  The chipotle tacos were so spicey that I learned today that the only way to off set that burn is by asking Kristen for a pack of sugar to quench the pain.  I highly recommend and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We're not regulars but more accurately described as \"occasional(s)\" to this Scottsdale heirloom. However, every time we come we're happy we did. Zachary gave excellent service, the filet was medium rare as ordered and tender tender tender. The new \"bricked chicken\" was excellent, almost had that \"confit\" texture and taste, along with excellent mashed potatoes and green beans that were cooked but with enough of a snap left in them to retain the best flavor. The sauteed spinach was just barely cooked and was equally excellent.   The only fault I found was the bread, the rolls were too \"doughy\" and while they may have been \"made and baked on the premises\" they didn't live up to expectations....should have a better bread offering.   No appetizer, 2 glasses of wine, two entrees, one shared dessert (complimentary for a birthday!) and we couldn't have eaten another item. Total was $75 plus tax and tip....very reasonable for a steak house offering this quality. Ratings below expect a \"cheap\" or \"mid range\" or \"fine dining\" and while some wouldn't consider $75 a mid range - I believe it is based on ambiance and value rather than $$ alone."}
{"text":"Village Tavern is my go to when dining in the South Park area. I've been going there for years and have always had a good experiences. Their hot crab dip never disappoints but most recently I tried their Miami Burger and spring rolls which were both flavorful and satiating. Service has always been good and you can't beat sitting back on their patio area and having some cold ones."}
{"text":"I grew up going to the village tavern in winston salem on the old reynolds property. My mother would order me a shirley temple while she had her manhattan. I am really happy that they have a village tavern in southpark. The food is always consistent and the ambiance is nice. I LOVE their outdoor patio, especially during the warmer months. I feel the prices are fair for the quality of food. The wait staff are friendly and knowledgeable and I  have always had a really good experience at this location."}
{"text":"So, my friend & I have been here twice. The first time was much better than this last occasion.   LUNCH: ·Tuna Salad - over cooked! Appalling that they even served it to my friend.   ·Fettuccini Alfredo- tasted worse than a frozen meal.    They offered to bring us something else, but we both look at each other and decided to leave after the disappointment in quality."}
{"text":"I am a well traveled thirteen year old boy. Village tavern is a nice little place that now has become one of my favs in Phoenix metro area.   There seem to be no starters so I am just gonna get right to the meal. I ordered from the kids menu since I did not want something big. My final decision was a classic burger. The burger was very well cooked and had some sort of cheese that was the best I have ever had and believe me, I know cheese, it's all I eat. My dad's got a BLT and a taco. The BLT was huge but good and my dad could not eat it all. He ate most of it, trust me, after that if he does not go to the gym he is Gonna have be fat. My grandma got the salad but she was very clear on how she wanted it so much so it technically was not a salad anymore.   I The service and the building  itself was nice. Our waiters name I think was Dylan so I give kudos to him and I like the interesting  conversations me and my family got engaged in with him. They have some amaze artwork in here. The lights over the table are equipped so you can pull them down if per say you could not read the menu.   Village tavern is a amazing place and I hope next Time I visit Phoenix I will come by here. I hope we get Dylan to wait on  us again"}
{"text":"I went here while on a business trip. I was not expecting to have the AMAZINGing large medium-rare  Prime Rib I had. I was not also expecting to have the wonderful Dirty Martini with the huge blue cheese stuffed olives. Another thing I didn't expect was the great service from the bartender.   I did expect bar food, weak drinks, and a lousy bar tender. Boy was I wrong."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Village Tavern.  We were having a pre-mother's day dinner on Saturday to avoid the usual Sunday crowds. Village Tavern was selected based on Yelp reviews and what appeared to be a very diverse menu.   We started off with a Guiness and a Fonseca Port Wine which was delicious.  A little pricey at $10.50 for about 4 oz of Port.  I enjoyed it though.  I ordered the French onion soup which was a little on the salty side but I love salt so I ate every last drop of it.  I selected a crab cake (appetizer) which came with tartar sauce along with an order of  french fries, The crab cakes were amazing.  Real crab meat almost no breading.  Excellent.   Hubby had the trout which was a really nice portion of filets with a teriyaki type glaze. He selected the sweet potato fries which had a hint of cinnamon and possibly a light sprinkling of sugar.  He really, really enjoyed his meal.  The true test of whether he likes a dish is to ask if he would order it again.  His answer was absolutely!   We topped off the dinner with apple cobbler with a scoop of Hagaan Daz.  We held off on the caramel sauce because we thought it would make it too sweet- and we were right.  The cobbler was really delicious and large enough that two of us couldn't finish it. This review would not be complete without commenting on the service.  Jared was our server and he was very informative and attentive.  Thanks to Jared now I know that seafood is flown in every day to Village Tavern.  That means I will go to Village Tavern for my seafood dishes.  Our waters were filled and he checked on us often.   Thanks Jared. And thanks   to Village Tavern for running such a great kitchen and a smooth operation."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say that VT has the worst service in town.  To the contrary, it's actually fairly standard.  What I like about VT; homemade chips, patio seating (when the weather cooperates), subtle ambiance, regularity of the quality.  While VT isn't the most unique and fabulous place in Charlotte, it is good.  I've found a few favorites on the menu and they're always tasty.  I tend to get a modified burger at lunch and, for the price, it's totally worth it.  VT has been around a long time and has a good following considering its weird location."}
{"text":"To say I just had the best meal I've had in a long Time would be an understatement.  I've been here for dinner and brunch a few times and it's always been good, but tonight was phenomenal.  For appetizers, we had shrimp cocktail (giant shrimp, great cocktail sauce w lots of horseradish in it!), and smoked salmon (which was absolutely delicious, the smoke flavor was great).  For dinner we had the BBQ baby back ribs which came w fries and coleslaw but we subbed asparagus for the fries.  It was a massive portion but really tender, fall off the bone meat!  And lastly...the star of the show...their newly featured grouper Hemingway which was pan seared, perfectly cooked grouper served on a bed of spinach in a white wine, lemon butter sauce and topped w tomatoes, capers, and Parmesan cheese.  I cannot say enough how absolutely delicious this was...if you're debating what to order, DEFINITELY give this a shot.  Service was also good, very prompt.  The ambience is pretty dark and quiet, typical of your classic steakhouse.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Village Tavern is a wonderful place with amazing food! The outdoor patio area is beautiful, relaxing, and great for events. They have THE BEST spinach dip of any restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"Ask for Kelly........best waitress........great hangout, fun place for casual drinks!!"}
{"text":"Their food is very good...their Cobb Salad is wonderful. Loaded with roasted chicken, crisp Romaine lettuce, bacon, and mild blue cheese. It is by far one of the best I have had. They have an extensive menu, from steaks and burgers to a large selection of fresh fish. They have a full bar with a large selection of finger foods. The atmosphere is a little dated, but, attractive, with a lodge feeling. Their serve is friendly and professional. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The service is always wonderful here!  They're sincere and truly friendly. The food has always been exceptional as well. It's one of my favorite places in Charlotte I can't wait until it's warm to enjoy the patio!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this restaurant and chose it based on reviews. Overall, it was a disappointment. Although the restaurant was not busy our server rushed us the whole evening. The size of the menu was overwhelming which makes me believe with a menu this size they could not possibly have the freshest food nor a prepare quality food, which is what our experience was. All of our entrees were server lukewarm instead of hot and really were not that good. Service was mediocre and the restrooms had not been checked for quite a while with trash overflowing. I now understand why on a Saturday night there were not many dining guests in the restaurant but then I wonder who is writing the glowing reviews."}
{"text":"Ordinarily really happy with this place and the service but this afternoon was a bit on the poor side for both food and service.    It was not crowded and we were seated right away, which was nice however our waiter came over about 5 or 6 minutes later to ask what we wanted to drink and eat.  We place our drink and app order and while we were telling him about our entree, he walked away.  I don't know if another patron got his attention or he was bored with us but just plain walked away.  He came back a few minutes later with our drinks and a cold appetizer.  We placed our entree order and our food was just...bad.  One order was undercooked, the other overcooked.  We tried to get his attention but he didn't come back from about 5 or 6 minutes again and we just figured \"f this\" ate and when he came back he just left the check and left again.  I have to say, I expect more and have always experienced better.  I would hate to think I have to take this place out of our rotation of places."}
{"text":"Sat in the bar for a late lunch...Had the crab cakes with mac & Cheese as my side. Everything was very good....lots of crab in the crab cakes and the Mac & Cheese was gourmet style and a surprisingly large portion for a side. I left very full and satisfied. Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"This place is a great spot! Very cozy with tons of food options. We've sat in the dining room and bar. Both are great! The tavern flatbread was actually really, really good! The deviled eggs app is great! 6 halves with a bunch of bacon on the side too."}
{"text":"I had meant to post this review sooner but I'm glad I waited. This is our favorite restaurant in Charlotte. This is the first restaurant we dined after after moving the Charlotte based on a recommendation and I am so glad we did. We have been to Village several times and it never disappoints. The food is wonderful, my favorite is the crab cakes, but it is also the atmosphere. It a great place to sit and relax and enjoy your meal being taken care of by incredibly friendly staff. We will continue to visit Village whenever we can. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It was delicious. The waitress gave the best service as well. The food came out fast as well. If you are a big dessert fan, get the cheesecake. It's HUGE but it tastes so good."}
{"text":"I love Village Tavern - it's a Charlotte legacy. But, it seems to have been frozen in time with a predictable menu, a stale atmosphere, and a medicore overall experience in the first floor of the dated office building. What VT needs is a facelift - to redefine itself in the offering of Southpark cuisine. If the beat up wooden tables and furniture aren't enough, then treck down the long hallway to the mens or ladies room to get a sense of life in the 90s. I am cheering for you VT, show us what you're made of!"}
{"text":"While meeting friends for lunch we decided to give this restaurant a try.  I thoroughly enjoyed my vegetarian Spaghetti Squash with broccoli, cauliflower, pine nuts etc. Hubby was disappointed with his Colorado chicken. Too much skin and fat. His choice of green beans as a side were undercooked. Too hard and crunchy for his taste. Lunch guest 1 liked her salmon while her companion gave his soup a thumbs up and just an average rating for his turkey reuben. Our waiter Cody was great.   We will probably give this another try in the future."}
{"text":"Had the Tavern Eggs Benedict and the Brie and Bacon omelette, both dishes very good with good flavor and right size portions! The muffins are to die for! The service was a little slow, so that is the reason I gave four instead of five! Pricing is good for Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Normal pub, not too pricy.  OK beer selections.  Service is quite friendly.  Food is ok, but not great.  I had the Thai Chicken Skewers and Tavern Pizza (with Sausage, Hamburger, Tomato Sauce and Jalopeno).  The Thai Chicken Skewers were quite good.  Dipping sauce was a little spicy, but just right.  The Tavern Pizza was thin curst, but for some reason, it wasn't particular tasty ever with all the strong flavored toppings, and it was quite oily."}
{"text":"I have been to the VT many times and it's always a good experience. Last night inspired me to write this review. I made a reservation through open table and arrived with my party of 7 for dinner. I goofed up and only made the res for 2 (totally my fault). Even though it was crowded, they found us a table and said they didn't need it for 90 minutes, asked if that would be ok. That's great!!  Food was great, I had the kale salad and added salmon, husband had sea bass. Both cooked perfectly. Son had shrimp and grits, others had steak, pork chops, a little of everything. I appreciate so much that the staff squeezed us in after my mistake. Great night!"}
{"text":"The cheap looking awning as you approach the place made me a bit skeptical of the place (located on the side of the Rotunda Bldg)... but once we entered I was pleasantly surprised.  At this point I can't think of anything negative to say about Village Tavern.  I've been twice... once for dinner with a HUGE group (Fall of 2013) and once for lunch (December 2015)... service was good both times... everyone enjoyed their meals.  Everything I've ordered has been DELICIOUS... pizza, kale salad, deviled eggs, crab dip, etc etc (see pics).   Parking was a little tight when we went as a big group back in 2013 (but it was a Friday night and we went a few hours after they'd opened).  The view was gorgeous... we could see light snowfall and city lights - ambience = 100! :)  Diners were in all sorts of attire... dressy, business, casual, panthers jerseys... so come as you are! :)   There's indoor and outdoor seating and the bar is a pretty decent size.    Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The crab cake is the best in town. If you order the Caesar salad with salmon, request it to be blackened. Game changer. If you are into beef, go for the marinated flank steak. Heaven on a fork.   The bar is very good sized and has full service for food and lots of TV's.   Bon apatite."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Chose this restaurant out of hundreds to have lunch with friends from Minnesota. Food and service was lousy. We have eaten there for years and it has really gone downhill. We told the waitress that 3 out of 4 of us were not happy. The Chicken Club sandwich is Lunch Meat and Cheese on toast. We're Done!!! Prices are high for the quality!"}
{"text":"Ran in right as they opened at 11, as I was in training nearby and needed a quick lunch. Sat in the bar, explained my time constraint, and ordered the shrimp and grits, but with peppers instead of mushrooms. WOW  Really great flavor, maybe a bit heavy on the garlic, but the  was cooked just right, nice and tender, and the grits were super creamy, not at all gritty. Just enough bacon too without being overloaded. I was in and out in about 20 minutes (including getting a to go box and water), and back to my class in plenty of time."}
{"text":"Food is really 2-3 stars, but its a good value and pricing is pretty cheap for the area. I gave them four stars because the service is excellent. Lorenzo was friendly, attentive, and accurate. Parking is easy. Get there early for happy hour as it gets pretty busy."}
{"text":"I had the turkey Ruben here and I reviewed it, but somehow the review is not here anymore. Now, I am annoyed and I recall the sandwich was suffering from poor quality turkey and was quite small and was Scottsdale priced for lunch at 11 bucks. Skip that sandwich, but stay for the white tableclothes and lovely hostess. Remember, this is a chain and has 11 locations, including one in the Phillipines...WTF?"}
{"text":"The Village Tavern is part of a somewhat upscale chain and a long-time Charlotte tradition - they have been here at least 20 years in the same location (we used to hang out here back in my college days.)   The service here has always been hit or miss... sometimes it's been really good and at other times it's been pretty dreadfful.  Over the years, I have had some really good meals here and other times, not so memorable.   However, I do find the Tavern to be a nice option when you have a group of people because generally everyone can find something on the menu...everything from salads, burgers, pasta, pizza, fish entrees, meat, etc.  They do have one of the best patios in town for when the weather is nice.  From time to time, they will have a band out on the patio which is cool.   As for appetizers, some of my favs here are the house-made fries, crab dip and Ahi Tuna Sashimi."}
{"text":"I was taking a friend out for his birthday and of course left it up to him to choose and he chose Village Tavern. This place was so great it felt like my birthday!  The restaurant may be a chain, but it certainly doesn't carry itself that way. I was completely surprised about that fact. I even told a friend of mine that the decor was reminiscent of Capital Grill in DC. The lighting was soft and inviting and the decor was really warm and rich. I felt so comfortable there.   Lisa was our waitress. I can only explain Lisa by saying that she surely must have been a server at the finest restaurants. I have NEVER had the kind of service she gave outside of Nobu/The London (Gordon Ramsay NYC), etc. It's the kind of service that is unobtrusive yet so attentive. As soon as we needed something it was as though we waved a magic wand and Lisa appeared. She was phenomenal. I highly recommend you ask for her to elevate your already incredible dining experience.   At her suggestion we started with the caprese and it was perfect. I love a really fresh, salty mozzarella and this was as though they made it on premises. It was a really nice starter and good for two people.  We then moved on to my very, very favorite thing almost ever. Mmmm! The southern shrimp and grits. Being from Texas you get a grit (ha ha) that is generally made in whatever way they boil it. There's generally no finessing it like VT does it. These were the creamiest, most flavorful grits I've ever tasted in my life, bar none. The shrimp. Oh wow. You can really mess up shrimp if you're not careful. It doesn't take much to push them over the edge to dried out which is no good for anyone. No problem here. They were large and tender and quite possibly I will want this dish to be the last thing I ever taste.   My friend got the prime rib and I'm positive he enjoyed it. My favorite part of his meal (he he)? The baked potato. I know that sounds silly, but have you ever had a potato with the outside coated in chunky salt? I have never (considering I've eaten at many a great restaurant). This was a revelation and I ate the whole thing. Sorry, I had to. It's a compulsion when I taste something that good I rarely care whose plate it's on. Delicious.   I say stop here, ask for Lisa, bypass the nachos and burgers and head straight to the gourmet. It's one of the best meals I've ever had."}
{"text":"The food at Village Tavern is consistently delicious, the service is quick, and the prices are reasonable.  It's a gorgeous steakhouse, (I suggest the Flank Steak) the wine selections are varied, and you can get a great Sauvignon Blanc or a Pino at a good price.   Overall, I love this restaurant and will continue to go there until I have a bad experience, which I haven't had yet. LOVE IT."}
{"text":"Visited during a business trip, didn't make reservations, but figured hey that's ok I'll wait and have a drink or two from the bar...Umm no service unless your seated there as the staff can not see past the counter...Atmosphere was nice not over the top but nice. Food was good had the Spaghetti squash and veggies, nicely prepared and presented well. Service was friendly...overall 3 stars gave an upscale look/feel, but lacked in real overall service for the look"}
{"text":"The service is terrible. I don't remember the last time I've been ignored by a waitress. It took over 30 minutes to order our food, then the food came and I was brought the wrong entree, and then it took a full 20 minutes before anybody came over to our table to ask if we wanted boxes or dessert. Lucky for us they brought us the wrong check and extended the meal that much longer. The food is good, don't get me wrong, but it is not enough to bring me back here.  *Quick amendment. The bill was comped."}
{"text":"Very comfortable yummy restaurant.   The bar is super comfortable with a outdoor patio and indoor bar with some nice almost too comfortable couches! The happy hour is great, my boyfriend loves the chilled sampler plate!  I lovvvvvvve their prime rib dinner. The seasoning and temperate is making me drool just thinking about it!  The the staff are very nice and seem pretty organized on the busiest nights. I love taking my family here to relax , enjoy each other's company and eat some really good food .   Been a fan for years and I'm sure more years to come !"}
{"text":"I ate here after the Penn State Football Game 12/30/17   They have a lot of seating and a ton of young nice waiters and waitresses!!   There was a ton of options to choose from!!   They had a GREAT kids menu with a lot of options!!   When the food came out (quicker than usual) it was very good so good we also ordered some dessert!!   When the dessert came out we only had one problem it had NUTS on it my son is allergic to NUTS so we asked them for a new one !!! They got us one with no issues!!!   If In area YOU MUST COME HERE!!!   9.75/10 - 0.25 because of the nuts on ice cream"}
{"text":"My wife and I are regulars here because the food and outstanding service never disappoint. We will continue to be regulars and highly recommend Village Tavern to our family and friends."}
{"text":"We love this place. We went in and it was packed with a hour and a half wait. We walked over to the bar area which is first come first serve and scored a high top table. We looked at the bar specials and they were great! I ordered the bar only special ribs which were a half rack with fries for 7.95 - double score!!!! They were great! For dessert,  we had the butter cake which is very rich. 5 of us split it. No complaints. We are going back tonight!"}
{"text":"So last night, Wednesday, my typical routine involves dragging my a$$ to a gym class. My friend calls me as I'm driving home from work and suggests the opposite of a workout -- Happy Hour. The week I've been having... there was just one answer-- YESSSSSSS!!!!   I suggested Village Tavern, having seen good reviews and remember eating there a year ago, wanting to revisit.  The experience last year wasn't really memorable -- it was the type of situation where I was hungry and the place is a mile from my house, so it more just fit the bill.  Last night however was a different story.  We go to the bar section, it is packed but still has a table or two available inside. We sit down, and are greeted by the waitress. We start with the happy hour $5 Grey Goose cocktails -- they are Strong. Just what the doctor ordered. We split the prime rib sliders, and brie plate. Each are around $8. Both are delish!!!! The prime rib sliders are so good, come with au jus and have a ton of melted cheese on them. The brie platter is very good as well. Dried cranberries, apricots, and almonds are plenty on the plate, as well as great italian bread and our own little brie wheel. For girls skipping gym class, this is what its all about -- happy indulgences.  We were debating a third cocktail before happy hour ended, when the waitress informed us that Wednesdays are half off all wine glasses -- ALL NIGHT!!! WOOHOO!!!  So we switched to a glass of wine each and nibbled on some toast triangles and the worries from earlier in the week just turned into good laughs with a good friend.  We also agreed next Wednesday, we WOULD go to gym class -- but come back to Village Tavern afterwards for a little wine indulgence.  ;)  The scene should be mentioned -- almost exclusively Gainey Ranch retirees. Looks like they get all the good seats by 5pm.  Its a scene where you can pay attention to your friends and your food because there just isnt much eye candy to distract you....unless you're over 50. The inside decor is upscale tavern-y, very warm and inviting."}
{"text":"brunch: really great food. not sure how they can charge $5.40 for two black coffees, and keep a straight face. service is good too."}
{"text":"Fabulous! The blackened bayou shrimp and shrimp & grits were both amazing. Good selection of local craft brews. The service was great and the staff was knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I have come here for quite some time.  My Prime rib is always so good.  The other offerings are great too.  I have never had a bad meal here, and always great service.  I highly recommend this place.  I would recommend this place to any out of town guest or family member.  Nice warm atmosphere and a table you can talk to someone without having to shout at them.  They have great sliders too!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service.  The dessert of warm butter cake was more than expected and very decadent."}
{"text":"The food is always excellent, my espresso martini was delish. My only complaint is that it seems like the restaurant is always a little on the warm side."}
{"text":"From hostess to wait staff , everyone is professional and cordial.  Consistently well prepared lunches and dinners.   Fresh salads and wonderful desserts.   Steaks are superb.  Always a good choice."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Chilean Sea Bass was so good. The prime rib was delicious too. The service was great. We will go back."}
{"text":"I've been a customer here for a while now, probably since 2012 or so. I found this place when my roommate's dad was visiting at the time and we wanted to have dinner and a few drinks. We drove past and found this place. Since then, I have a go to which is their amazing prime rib with mashed potatoes. Flavor is great, (especially if you're hungover haha), but I've always had fast, efficient and friendly service as well.   Bar is open seated, dining room is huge so there's always room. My recommendation? Try the prime rib with a nice cold beer and you won't be disappointed. Don't go to late though, because they will run out!"}
{"text":"Went while on vacation in South Park. I would have to say meh, at best. Wife and I ordered two old fashions, server didn't ask what kind of bourbon but I ran with it anyway. These we not old fashions, they were bad bourbon with water, no bitters, orange slice maraschino cherries stirred together. This is one of the only drinks I have ever returned. I ordered the clam chowder and received a 3/4 full cup of descent soup with no crackers or bread even offered. My wife had a Cesar salad that was a large portion that was just okay. I ordered shrimp and grits, they were again he just okay. I was not happy with the large pools or red oil or grease that was on top of the grits. This was the first time I've ever had S and G so I was a bit disappointed. My wife got the blackened tilapia with crab cream sauce. It was pretty tasty, but the sides looked and tasted uninspired, average rice pilaf and some soggy yet well buttered green beans. The 3.50 craft beers were a nice treat. Our service was rather poor, the server was new and not in tune with the customers needs. I was chuckling because the table had a now hiring ad in the specials placard. I also laughed when I looked around to see random bread baskets placed about the restaurant. I guess it's my fault for not asking. We were told all the food was scratch made, but I'm a bite skeptical myself. Not my favorite place while in Charlotte, but seeing how busy they were many must like it."}
{"text":"What a perfect local restaurant! Great variety of food offerings. Just appetizers and a glass of wine is terrific. Attentive staff. Noise level is kind of loud because of the hard floors and surfaces, but it is a fun and delicious place."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I loved everything about Village Tavern....  Food - Village Tavern has one of those menus, that has you wanting to try every single thing on the damn menu!  There's many different options to choose from, they all sound amazing.  Here's the three items I've tried...   -Hot crab dip is an awesome appetizer option, pita bread comes served warm and soft. -Chicken Club is one of the better \"clubs\" I've had in recent memory.  Its pretty much a chicken sandwich served with plenty of chicken, ham and bacon served on warm, toasted bread (see pics). -Chicken Colorado was awesome!  All of the different foods - the chicken, black beans, rice, cheese, tomatoes worked perfectly together.  I am not sure if it was worth $18.50, but then again maybe it was.  I can't say one bad thing about the food here at Village tavern.    Service - Sat at the bar.  The lady bartender/server was awesome.  No complaints at all.   Ambiance - As others have stated, Village Tavern has a very unassuming quality to it.  It's kind of hidden in the back of some office/retail park.  The only way to identify Village Tavern is by the janky, blue awning that marks the entrance.  But once you're inside, its quite a different feel.  Elegant, open, classy, quaint, are all adjectives that come to mind.    The only thing I regret is that I am just recently discovering this hidden jewel in the heart of South Park.  There's about 20 other items on the menu I want to try. The service and ambiance are above and beyond my wildest expectations. No doubt I'll dine at Village Tavern again and hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"We had a pretty good experience on our last visit.  I had a Thai chicken salad that was pretty good...not the best in the area but a decent lunch. I also had a couple of glasses of decent Chardonnay. My wife had a chicken salad with sweet potato fries and thought it great.  I had key lime pie: not the best but still a nice dessert.  Service was excellent considering it was the height of the lunch hour.  This is a good place for lunch, at least."}
{"text":"Summary: Okay food, but beware of raw food.  Went with my mom on Sunday at 1pm. They were severely understaffed as even the hostess, server and manager said it. That makes you wonder if everyone internal thinks the business is run bad, what should I think?  Onwards to service, we got water right when we sat down and then we ordered food (breakfast burrito and French toast). Burrito was good the French toast on the other hand was served raw, and wrong. It's so wrong that Gordon Ramsey would have a field day. It was so bad, the manager looked at it, and knew it was raw. The server was nice but could tell the difference between a good French toast and what we served.  We sent it back and got Belgium waffles, and another mush. They weren't cooked all the way, not even golden brown. Good food but badly run business. I doubt I'd stop in for breakfast and I wouldnt  order anything complex. Jay the manager didn't stop by after the second time."}
{"text":"Very dirty glasses... real turnoff. Food was just average. And in Scottsdale options for excellent food are abundant.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Perfect for a date night or family gathering. They have everything from fantastic dinner specials to the horse races. They don't have as many vegetarian options as one would like, but for the carnivorous folk the ribs are OFF THE HOOK!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The service and food were excellent! It was Mother's Day and birthday dinner so thought it would be busy and we would have to wait but we were seated right away. Our waiter was very friendly and on top of everything. The bread was warm and tasted like a sweet roll - amazing! The meatballs are a newer menu item and were cooked excellent. The Hemingway Florentine was great and just the right amount of food to be filling. The steak was cooked perfectly as well as the burger. We subbed a side for Mac and cheese, which was another great dish. Finally, we ended with one of their amazing desserts with the butter cake which was to die for!!! I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here. I had filet mignon and it was awesome! Very good steak. But my husband had the ribeye and wasn't too impressed with it. But all together we were satisfied!"}
{"text":"Solid, high-end restaurant/bar but with the aptly named \"tavern\" ambience."}
{"text":"I went back to Arizona on vacation and visited this restaurant again. Again i was very happy with the food and the service and the 'sticky butter cake' dessert was amazing 5 stars."}
{"text":"Standard charlotte tavern/fare. Above average sandwiches and burgers.  Don't miss out on the thai chicken nachos and the relaxing patio on one of those nice charlotte evenings."}
{"text":"After an awful dinner at pomo pizza, which happens to be in the same plaza, my group decided to stop here for a nightcap, which ended up saving the evening. The bartender was super cool, the drinks were very well made, and the food we ordered to share was fantastic. We had some small plates off the happy hour menu that all hit the spot after abandonding our meals at pomo."}
{"text":"been going there for years, but this one was pretty bad.  ordered fish and chips, 3 pieces of burned fish, chips not hot, and no vinegar.  4 of us spent $160, not well spent.  going elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Friday Happy Hour. The end to a dramatic week, eh? Well we've got good drinks, good friends and good food. It doesn't get any better.  FYI. This place serves top quality drinks and great happy hour foof"}
{"text":"Village Tavern is one of our families go-to restaurants. My parents were visiting so we came for brunch. We requested  for some bread, which was very fresh and warm. It was good, nothing special. The service was adequate. The dishes that we everybody got were, Chicken Teriyaki, 2 Belgian Waffles, a Breakfast Burrito, Make Your Own Omelette, And a BLT. Everybody enjoyed their food. Nothing was bad, but it wasn't the best place ever. The breakfast burrito, BLT, and omelette were just typical meals of their type, but they were still definitely good. Everybody that got the waffles loved them. The chicken teriyaki is one of my wife's favorite dishes, and she loved it of course. We will be planning on coming back to Village Tavern."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar at 5:15 on a Monday (the only place Happy Hour is valid) at the restaurant and were amazed at how busy it already was. The website shows no Happy Hour food offerings and frankly that's a good thing because there was nothing of interest on the happy hour food menu. We did partake in the $5 cocktails and $4 wine.  We decided not to order from the less than interesting happy hour food menu and ordered the Shanghai crispy calamari from the regular menu. It was a very large plate of thin and crispy calamari rings literally doused in a sweet and spicy Thai chili sauce with crisp and spicy pickled jalapeños, scallions, and peanuts. It could've been a tiny bit hotter but it was delicious.  For dinner my better half got the cowboy chicken sandwich with black beans. He loved the sandwich, the crispy onion rings, the bacon, cheese and barbecue sauce. The black bean side dish was not warm enough but the server quickly returned it with a new plate, fully hot.  My dish was the Idaho trout - highly recommended by the server, who was right once again. It was perfectly cooked, juicy and not dry with just enough of this sweet soy teriyaki glaze to give it flavor but not overpower it. The green beans were tender but still green and the rice pilaf was a good base for both of those items.  Manhattans made with Jack Daniels were five dollars during happy hour and they were delicious with a Luxardo cherry but make sure you tell the server not to shake if you like a clear, see-through Manhattan!  We will return!"}
{"text":"Very nice experience. Laura, our server, was very friendly and capable, patiently handling our talkative, distracted party of eight. The dining area was a bit smaller than I expected - basically just one decent sized room. The big outside patio was closed due to rain.  I had the fresh fish tacos with blackened tilapia. They were tasty, but messy to pick up and eat. We appreciated the gluten-free menu and lots of options for my wife. She got the grilled salmon and said it was wonderful.  We would gladly return to Village Tavern!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for late night dining when you want to amble down the road from the Hyatt at Gainey Ranch... The bar seating was just the right setting to revel on a Sunday night and since the Kitchen closed at 10pm (but the bar is open til 12am) we took our time w the Menu... We enjoyed the Quinoa & Kale Salad which sounds a little too healthy by the description but was made less so by the fried crunchy onions piled on top which were delicious!  Then had a side of sautéed spinach & the Chicken Tacos to split... Portions were massive and just what we needed after a long day of hiking Camelback mountain! Great wine selection too! The Service was top notch and almost too friendly (in a pleasant way!) but this is what happens when the server mentions he's a bow hunter and gets my Man all excited to talk about things I find boring!  Oh well, at least I got an extra glass of Pinot Grigio out of the deal!"}
{"text":"We are new to Charlotte (less then a year) and try one different restaurant ever week, and this was a great choice. We happened to pick up their brochure at the visitors center so we thought we'd try it.   I had the chicken Marsala and it was as good or better then Olive Gardens. It came topped with a very tasty grave with bacon and mushrooms. It was absolutely delicious and was a nice portion size.   My husband had the grilled meatloaf which was an unusual choice for him eating meatloaf at a restaurant. It turned out to be very good! He also had the spinach as the side it was yummy with a hit a salt for flavor very good. It to was a nice size portion.  We will definitely be going back. It was so much to choose from on the menu we both had a hard time making up our minds, So will be returning to try all the other yummy sounding menu items"}
{"text":"We have frequented village tavern in their Greensboro location for years. When we moved to Charlotte we were excited to try their Charlotte location. We took my mother and a father in law to eat on a Friday night while they were in town visiting, along with our two children. It was a short wait to be seated, however, once we were seated it took forever to receive our drinks and even to place our drink order. Once we were able to place our drink orders and received them they were awful, both of our kids drinks tasted like watered down juice. Our bar drinks were horrible and had to be sent back to the bar. Once we then placed our food order it took over an hour to receive our food. We watched as other tables that were sat after us received their food ahead of us. Long story short, our experience was very sub par as was our service. The waitress was over worked and the bar and restaurant were understaffed. When we spoke with the manager she only offered us an excuse of it being a busy night (as if Friday's aren't always busy) and then she offered us a free dessert. No thanks! After such a long wait for food our kids were tired and we were ready to leave. Again, not what we would have expected from Village Tavern."}
{"text":"Rarely do I ever give a 5 star, but here we are. We ended up here after finding our original go to Scottsdale location was closed. I hopped on yelp in a hurry to find something around us that wasnt pretentious, full of hipsters, or overly \"new\". Don't get me wrong, I like unique, I love creative, i don't love trendy. Anyway. We liked into this place on a good yelp review. And I so glad we did. Not only did we go one night, but we went two. The first night was filled with spicy calamari, shrimp and grits, and shrimp tacos. The calamari... To die for. Not chewy, not soggy, just amazing. Fried pickled jalapeños? Umm yes please. Actually that was the only complaint... More of those would be good in there. My shrimp and gross was heaven, and the shrimp tacos surpassed expectation. And the bill? Not bad. Not bad at all. Night 2 was pimento cheese deviled eggs, delicious but not as magical as the calamari. I had flank steak and my husband had fish and chips. And then we had dessert (butter cake, which to me is just splendid) I just wanted to nap there. I had so much flank steak I had to feed half of it to my husband. And his fish was fabulous. Even the sides both nights were awesome. Black beans were tasty and not bland at all. So honestly, the food is awesome, the service was impeccable, and the bill was nothing to complain about. We both ate more than any person should have and it was good and it was under 100 bucks. (drinks, apps  dessert, entree) I know we will be back here again and again!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant in Charlotte. They have a huge menu that has something everyone can enjoy (and I have been enough times to almost try everything on the menu.) None of their food disappoints. My favorites are the salmon sandwich and their chicken marsala.   The restaurant it self is beautiful and never too noisy which is great, I tend to bring my family here often and that is a big deal for them. Service tends to be pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Our family visits the Scottsdale area 2-3 times a year, and we always try and make it to this restaurant.  The Village Tavern has a wonderful mix of comfortable and welcoming atmosphere, and the calmness and sophistication of Scottsdale.    The staff is well trained and attentive, and the menu is diverse.  The food is excellent.  Pizzas, salads, sandwiches and their entrees all offer high quality and with enough variety for the whole family.  The flank steak is my favorite."}
{"text":"If you want to see how to ruin a steak,  this is the place to go.   THE GOOD, BAD and UGLY.  Good - the wine, beet salad and calamari.  Bad - cocktails in a water glass with 90% ice AND serving a steak raw on the inside burnt on the outside.  If you don't know how to cook a steak don't put it on the menu, if you can't tell it is raw when you pick it up and put it on a cold plate don't serve it up. Ugly - after sending it back you bring back the same steak cut in half put on TWO COLD PLATES with the same mash potatoes and wilted asparagus then tell me their is a fine line between rare and medium rare.   I walked out, after looking at the attached pictures you would too.  Steak tasted like blood, see the red mash potatoes."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food waitress serving us was very nice and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I ordered the blackened salmon sandwich soo juicy and the fries were fresh and crisp."}
{"text":"One of THE best happy hours in town!!! Go early or you won't get a seat!  Great prime rib sliders! Great ribs!! Shrimp tacos are great too!!! $5 Grey goose drinks!!"}
{"text":"My family and I are always thinking \"where should we go to dinner tonight?\" - and we always end up at the Village Tavern for several reasons: 1. Consistently amazing food and service, 2. Diverse menu (and we have a lot of picky eaters in my familiy!, 3. Happy Hour specials, 4. Fun bar atmosphere (great to just grab a glass of wine and a snack), 5. Fun monthly wine specials  Some of my favorites: Smoked salmon appetizer (I usually do this as my dinner it's so good), Turkey Burger, Pork Loin"}
{"text":"Village Tavern is a family favorite. It is located in the same parking lot as Hash Kitchen and I am always wonder why more people don't brunch here, especially when there is a wait at Hash Kitchen.   Things to get: Brunch - Eggs Benedict.  Lunch - Beet Salad  They have a huge selection on the menu and there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"If we could rate 10 stars, we would. The food,  and all of our interactions with every staff member have always been outstanding. Always a great time !!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot We had an unexpected overnight layover in Charlotte, read some reviews on Yelp and TA. We are a very picky family and I have Celiac (gluten free) Great fish and chips, kids chicken tenders. Awesome shrimp and grits.  Gluten free menu was great. Very good burger. Would highly recommend. Don't order the guac. Good service and atmosphere. I would give 4 and a half if possible"}
{"text":"I was invited here for a birthday dinner and had a wonderful meal along with pristine service. We both had salads to start. Perfect size for an appetizer salad. Not too small and had lots of fresh veggies. I had the filet mignon and my friend had the prime rib. We both had sides (potato and asparagus. The meat was a perfect medium rare as ordered and the sides were simple and tasty. The atmosphere was dark wood and reminded me of Houston's. The service was terrific. Friendly, refills, and we didn't have to remind her of anything. All dressings were on the side as asked. Will definitely go here again and will highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place can be easy to miss and forget about, due to its nondescript location but the food really is good.  I've actually been pleasantly surprised by the food. I expected it to be on par with say Applebees but it's more on par with Firebirds.    The macaroni and cheese is to die for... although the past two times we've gone it's been really overly greasy. The mashed potatoes and green beans are probably my favorite sides as I think they are very well done. The prime rib I had was delicious and I've had a regular steak there too that was awesome.  My friend really likes the Cowboy chicken!!    So basically I've never eaten anything bad here. The ambiance is kind of like a chain trying to be classier which is perfectly okay. The booths are comfortable and the lighting is fairly dark but not so dark you can't see anything (because they have windows for natural light). Their outside patio is great on summer nights as well. All in all I give it 3.5 stars but I'll give them the bump up as I know I'll be back again :-)"}
{"text":"Went here to eat, and it wasn't the first time.  It's a nice place, and usually has consistent food.  I had a quarter wedge salad and a margherita pizza.  The wedge was good, even though I ordered the dressing on the side and it didn't come that way.  The pizza was also good, and I would recommend it.  My biggest complaint is that a pizza isn't considered an \"entree\".  The wedge salad would've been $2 cheaper had I ordered an entree.  When we asked our waitress about it she said the sandwiches, pizzas, and burgers aren't considered entrees.  That's quite misleading.  Now $2 isn't enough to not convince me to go back, but the principle of it is a little ridiculous.  We knew it wasn't the waitresses fault, and left it at that.  All in all, I will go back, but I don't think I'll get a salad unless I make sure I order an \"entree\"."}
{"text":"A friend and I tried to go to Alma today for lunch, but realized it is closed on Monday when we arrived.  We quickly came up with plan B and headed down to Village Tavern to save the day.  I had not been here in such a long time and I am regretting this decision as my lunch was amazing.  We both enjoyed the spaghetti squash and zucchini entree and it was absolutely delicious!  Great atmosphere (although a little old school), great service and great food too!"}
{"text":"I really can't give this place 4 of my stars yet.  I've been here about a dozen times over the years and it has always been...well...just ok.  It is a pretty solid place that spits out a pretty good array of food such as burgers, salads, steaks, fish, sandwiches etc. etc. etc.  I don't think they specialize in anything.  I've probably tried just about every type of thing they offer and it is always good but not spectacular or memorable.  The one thing I do love about this place is the service.  Everyone is very very helpful and friendly every time I've been here.  I'm not sure why but I think it is because a much older demographic frequents this place who they tend love overly friendly service.  Also, this place tends to get pretty busy around dinner time so you may have to wait 15-25 mins to be seated so make reservations if you are able."}
{"text":"This is our solid GO TO place for special occasions or just a simple dinner out!!   From a burger with great fries - to steak or prime rib with everything - and lots of options in between!  Village never disappoints!!   Incredible service, outstanding food quality - a dining experience that you are looking for!!  Cannot recommend Village enough!!!   Try it once, and you will look for reasons to go back and go back and go back!!!!    TIP  -  make reservations!  Even just for 2.  They get very busy (indicative of what a great dining experience it is) and a walk in wait could be very long."}
{"text":"Village Tavern has been a regular staple and a place where I go for comfort food....they have meatloaf on the menu - how can you fo wrong with that?! They have everything on the menu from all the soups and salads, to burgers, pizza, sandwiches, steaks, chicken, pastas.....kids menu as well! Anything that you are looking for .....is on this menu. Serving lunch, brunch and dinner....always a great place to meet up for happy hour (this place always seems to be the 'meet in the middle' place between alot of my friends). So it works! The bar area is a great place to just chill and have a cocktail -dark wood interior with a fireplace....good ambience."}
{"text":"Food great, service not so much. I went about a month ago. I had a Caesar salad with steak. The dressing was very good and you could tell it was made in-house which is key to making a good Caesar salad. My friends liked their salads as well which had fried chicken in them. We sat outside on the patio which is nice. The service was not good though. The wait stuff was rude and acted like we were such a burden. At the end, they overcharged each of my friends by $30. That was the icing on the cake. We talked to a manager who fixed the overcharging on the cards but all he really had to offer besides that was a \"sorry you feel that way.\"  Needless to say, I will be back sometime because I haven't found a better Caesar anywhere."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with a couple coworkers. I was skeptical since it looks like a strip mall brewey style restaurant (think Rock Bottom or BJ's) and I wasn't in the mood for pub food. Pleasantly suprised though with what we had - chicken skewers, french onion soup, prime rib, chicken marsala, and a pasta dish. All was very good and fresh. They also had a nice selection of beer and wine @ very reasonable prices. Bottle of wine as cheap as $30 and they also had Opus One for $210...and many choices in between. Our waitress was very friendly and attentative."}
{"text":"Shame on restaurant manager, Chris, at Scottsdale Village Tavern. He basically called me a liar when I told him that I had been instructed an hour earlier by a young woman at his restaurant to call in when enroute and they will put our name on the wait list because this restaurant doesn't accommodate diners of small parties requests otherwise. When I called back to say we're on the way, another staff member kept me on hold for several minutes- by then we had just arrived into the parking lot- and then Chris picked up the phone identified himself as the manager. He insisted that if he were to believe me that his staff would actually tell me that they they would take my name, then I must prove it by stating the woman's name who had instructed me to call back in. OUTRAGEOUS!!!!!   As a local Scottsdale resident who has previously dined at Village Tavern, my business should be far more important than the flash-in-the-pan snowbirds who might happen by, because we support our Scottsdale restaurants all year round - even in the dead of summer. DONE WITH VILLAGE TAVERN."}
{"text":"The food, the service, the ambiance, everything was amazing! For my appetizer I had the crab dip which was creamy and didn't taste too fishy. There were so many options on the menu that all sounded delicious so it was a hard choice. I ended up going with the Cajun Seafood Fettuccine with the Tavern salad and I'm glad I did! That had to be the best starter salad I've ever had. The veggies were fresh and the bacon was crispy like I like it. The seafood in the pasta was fresh and plentiful and the sauce had the perfect amount of spice.   I can not wait to go back and try some of the other menu options!"}
{"text":"My four gal pals and I pick a new place every couple of months to do a happy hour plus dinner. Since we are all former coworkers, it's a great way to socialize and get caught up with one another. Two of the group loves going to the Village Tavern since they live near it in Scottsdale.  First tip: make sure you make a reservation! We did and I'm glad. This place is a definite favorite with the snowbirds and retirees. There is a lot of seating around the bar, a separate dining room, and the patio but it fills up quickly. It was packed.  It's American style food. But you have a great selection. You can have so many different appetizers and flat breads, street tacos, burgers and sandwiches, well-known salads and soups. They have seafood, steaks. The Kitchen will even have prime rib specials some days. Their beverage list is long and well-rounded. Our server Colin, was very knowledgeable. He even steered us towards the triple berry martini and it was spot on. Without alcoholic drinks, your bill will probably come to about $25 pp If you stay away from the higher end items ie:surf and turf.Specialty drinks are about $10 plus each.  Creme Brûlée was delicious. My friend had the very best, carrot cake which they are known for and she gave it 2 thumbs up.  The diners all looked happy and it was very nice to see that most were conversing without their dreaded cell phones out.  Everyone looked like they were having a great time.  I have already recommended this place to one of my friends who is out visiting with her family over spring break. They enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"When I first started in the construction industry 15 years ago, before SouthPark was packed with every kind of restaurant imaginable, the place to see and be seen after work for my crowd was the Village Tavern patio.  Good times!  Flash forward to 2014...  I have been maybe 3 or 4 times in the past 10 years.  With my visit in June 2014, I noticed that they have remodeled extensively (my waiter said Labor Day 2013).  Gone is the heavy wood paneled wall that separated the bar and the dining area, the area is now very open and quite lovely.  As another review stated, the parking lot was deficient to begin with and now that construction barriers are blocking off one street, it is even worse.  Luckily,  I was early, so I was able to find a spot.  Had I needed to search for a spot, I would have crossed the street to SouthPark.  My waiter was pleasant enough, I recognized him from a previous visit, so it would seem he has been there for quite a while.  My drink was kept filled, food was brought promptly and smoking hot.  The food: Spinach Dip ($8.75) - Just as I remembered it - this is not your typical spinach dip.  While creamy and loaded with spinach, there are chunks of tomatoes and a definite jalapeno *zing* under the melted cheese topping.  I would like the tomatoes to be a little smaller, but that is a personal preference.  Served bubbling hot with tri-colored tortilla chips, this made a decent starter.  3.5/5 Gastropub Burger ($11) - Well, I didn't love it.  The caramelized onions were kind of tasteless.  The flavors didn't do it for me, it just tasted rather mushy and off.  With that said though, the burger itself was very juicy, cooked to medium perfection, though maybe someone was a little heavy handed with a peppery seasoning.  The bun also held up pretty well to the messy toppings and juicy beef. The potato salad that I got as a side (they also have fries or sweet potato fries), tasted exactly like the red skinned potato salad that Harris Teeter has, but it was sprinkled with bacon - it was good, and not overly mayo'ed.  2/5 (I would not order this burger again, but I would try another of their burgers, those coming out of the kitchen looked quite good).  Overall it was a nice visit.  With all of the food choices in the area, I don't know that I would rush to return, but it was a nice enough meal with good service."}
{"text":"Called ahead of time to ask if dogs were permitted on the outdoor patio. We were told it was okay to bring our dog. Drove 30 minutes to eat here only to be told at the door that dogs weren't allowed due to state code (further research indicates this is false). We informed the manager that we called ahead of time to specifically ask. She blamed it on a misinformed employee. No offer to give us a gift certificate for our trouble or anything. Clearly a very poorly managed restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, food and great atmosphere. Had the spaghetti squash and corn on the con was amazing. Grilled meatloaf mashed potatoes green beans hubby said was awesome .warning large portions  Will be back with friends!!!"}
{"text":"Went back to VT last night to meet a friend, and the food, service and atmosphere was just as good if not better than my first trip here!   First important tip: Wednesday is HALF OFF WINE night! Ya HOO! There are some exceptions on their \"higher end\" stash, but I can live with the other choices. So I ordered a Meomi Pinot Noir, and for half off, the bottle only came to like $20 or so! GREAT Deal since that's about what it is in the stores (yes I know, but I've come to grips with the dreaded price doubling of wine in restaurants).   So to start, my friend recommended the freshly made chips with ranch sauce. Perfectly crispy, a little salt, and yummy ranch dressing. Spot on. Personally I would have liked a TAD more salt on them, but no major complaints.  So I've seen their steak menu and after a LONG, HARD workout, I convinced my body that I need PROTEIN to feed those muscles of mine.......my brain fought back but the muscles won! So I ordered the 10oz Filet, cooked medium rare (of course - I'm not a fan of shoe leather), and opted for their cognac cream sauce. I make a killer Au Poivre with Congna Cream sauce at home, so I admit to being a little snobby when it comes to this sauce. Quite frankly mine IS better, but this one was pretty good. I'd recommend the Bernaise Butter over the Filet though.....that will be my next choice.   For my side I chose the Gourmet Mac and Cheese and the Spinach. Both were excellent! The Mac & Cheese was very good as the outside was crispy (i.e., slightly burned) and I LOVE THAT! My only addition would be to add a dash of Truffle Oil. But that's just me......I'm a Truffle Oil fool. The spinach was cooked perfectly as it was sauteed in olive oil and garlic, with the requisite amount of wilting yet maintained a good firm texture.   OK so I've talked about the sauce, but have been remiss to describe the FILET! One word: PERFECTION! The quality of the beef was excellent (Prime???) but it's the way it was prepared that was awesome. The outside was crispy due to the apparent high heat oven yet the inside was literally MELT IN YOUR MOUTH tender! And as you can see in the photos, it WAS cooked perfectly to Medium Rare. All this really needed was a little butter on top (again recommend the Bernaise Butter) and it was truly superb! Coming from a Beef town like Chicago, I am singing this restaurants high and well-deserved praise!  All in all this was a GREAT meal! Very reasonably priced for the quality of food served, and the service is always very, very good.   Kudos to the Management Team at VT! Don't know if that's recently changed or what given some of the pooer reviews from the past. But this is my thrid time here and all three times, each has been FIVE STAR EXPERIENCE!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Best Shrimp and Grits EVER!!!  Quick service  Large variety on menu  Recommended by many"}
{"text":"Very good experience! Great ambiance, awesome food and very tasty desserts! The service was outstanding and the people very friendly!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious from start to finish!  Garden Tonic is fabulous, Cubano Sandwich delicious!  Great staff, food quick, hot and tasty!  Great vibe, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite drop in for Happy Hour bites & beverages. Wednesday's 1/2 off any wines that they serve by the glass is definitely the best deal in all of Scottsdale & their bar food menu deals are a hit as well. Top shelf $5 martini's as well are sure to leave you very Happy."}
{"text":"We came from Staten Island, NY to visit some friends. They had never been to this restaurant before, but other friends of theirs recommended it so we thought we would give it a try. We went for lunch  today, Monday, November 6, before they took us to the airport. Our waitress Julianna, was courteous and very professional. I ordered a sangria, she brought a glass with some liquid in the bottom of the glass and some fruit, I thought to myself what a small glass of sangria. She then proceeded to pour a small bottle of prosecco into the glass.  It was a very tasty glass of sangria, very different. I ordered the crab cake sandwich, which I thought was one of the better crab cakes I ever had. This is a great place to try, and the prices were reasonable. Nice atmosphere! Great all around!"}
{"text":"stoped by monday nite around 930 pm after work after not eating all day i was glad to see they were open when i walked in i headed straight for the bar.......of course ,there i was greated by a very friendly bar server she says are u here to eat ...i said o yeah she quickly fired me up my drink order and begain to explain the food options they do have a reverse happy hour which offered a few good options i ended up with the calamari which could have been served hotter served with a sweet chili sauce ...not 5 dollars and the chicken egg rolls which were pleanty hot also w/sweet chili sauce and a aioli as well. the total bill was around 40 bucks 2/3 of that was booze of course but i was very happy when i left"}
{"text":"We had a very good dinner here on Sunday afternoon.  Service was excellent and my dinner pals' meals were excellent.  Mine was a little less because the flank steak was tough even though I requested medium rare.  The sauce, potatoes, and spinach that came with it were excellent.  I just wasn't able to eat the steak.  My friend's trout was fantastic and the filet mignon my other dinner companion had was also great.  Wish mine had been that good."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal with husband visiting relatives from out of state. Great service and food. But did make a reservation because it's always packed. Good Friday was a wonderful evening. The manager couldn't have been better and Kristin our waitress was awesome. Great ambiance and food."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a lovely lunch there today.  I had the crispy chicken sandwich, which was excellent.  My roommate had the meatloaf which was wonderful.  We also had the calamari for our appetizer and it was very tasty.  Our server Andrew, was outstanding!  He had an excellent and engaging personality, offered clear and measured advice about the menu, and resolved a dessert issue with both humor and diligence.  I would very much recommend this place as a family friendly establishment (both kids enjoyed their food) with traditional fare done very well at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The Village Tavern is a straight up American Restaurant. You can get anything from sandwiches (Blackened Salmon Sandwich is great) to a nice big salad (Greek Salad + Chicken...very nice) to a nice piece of fish (Grouper Hemingway = amazing dish) or a steak (Prime Rib is where it's at). The prices are fair and you can go in and have a really good meal for anywhere between $20-$100 for two. Their bar is a really nice set-up with some flat screens and their happy hour is like half off booze and they have a nice little bar menu with some little snacks like these Prime Rib Sliders that kick some serious butt. The service is friendly and the staff is really good about helping everyone out even if they aren't our server. All in all they do things pretty well at the Village Tavern and for what they are trying to offer, they hit the nail right on the head."}
{"text":"Ate here again the other night - always delicious food and decent service.  My only complaint is that the dessert selection isn't the greatest, although the other food is always outstanding, especially the potato chips.  Will return again with friends and family."}
{"text":"I love their burgers and Moscow mules! Gorgeous outdoor space overlooking South Park! I love that I live within walking distance. Great service!"}
{"text":"Prime rib is the best in town....happy hour menu has very good options....the spaghetti squash as a healthy option with the basil and tomatoes is very tasty....always  consistent....inside needs updating..sit in the bar or patio"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place on a Friday night. We didn't have a reservation and it was a bit crowded but we were seated in just a couple of minutes. Server was very prompt; got our drink orders and returned with them quickly. He took our food order and was very nice. I got the Grilled Meatloaf that came with mashed potatoes and string beans and I got the Spinach salad too. I really enjoyed my meal; in truth I felt full after the salad but I powered through and ate 1/2 my meal. The meatloaf was very good; 2 thick charred slices with the dish; sort of a smokey flavor to it. The salad was really good too. My husband got a chicken sandwich but he said the chicken was dry and it was way to difficult to eat as a sandwich so he used a fork and knife to eat it instead... he had a taste of my meatloaf and agreed it was good - better then his; I shared :) Our bill was around $50; that included 2 entrees, one side dish (mac & cheese) that was good, my salad and 1 glass of wine and 1 beer. Not inexpensive but also not too bad considered we each took 1/2 the entrees home and had them for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Such a shame that I came here during an awful heatwave, their outdoor patio looked spacious and nice. The place looks pretty nice inside with dark wood, warm colors, and dim lighting all around.  I went for the restaurant week menu while my date just wanted something light and ordered off the menu. Starting off with the crab cake app. it was flavorful and the crab tasted fresh and slightly sweet. My only complaint would be that it is freaking tiny! I ate it in 2 bites, and I take tiny bites so I hope this is not representative of their regular size crab cake app. If it is I recommend ordering the crab cake sandwich as an app which was more sizable for only $2 more. Next came the salad which I really liked, not too much dressing and a nice flavor combination. I wanted their maple cured pork chop initially as an entree but they had run out of it by 6:30 apparently. So I settled for the server's recommendation of bayou shrimp. The sauce on the shrimp was a bit too salty, the rice it was served on helped a little bit with that though, and the seasoned green beans served alongside it were probably the most awful I've ever had. There were stems and very tough fibers on them that were extremely hard to overlook. This was quite a shame since they were seasoned nicely and I liked the flavors but they were quite inedible. Dessert however was just awesome, I opted for some warm apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce drizzled everywhere. Delicious!  Service was surprisingly attentive even though we visited during crw. The food was overall enjoyable even if I feel like portions here are a bit on the small side."}
{"text":"Just a really chill bar with a good crowd.  Last time we were there we had some legit pizza and some type of appetizer sampler.  All good!  Pours are also generous here and every once in a while some local celebs wonder in for a drink as well.   All makes for a great time any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Great place while visiting AZ. Excellent atmosphere for lunch. Excellent service and Prime Rib was best I've ever had.  Well done!"}
{"text":"The service from Ashley B. was great..... They only get 3 stars because my husband's poor luck.... His burger was WAY too salty, then paper in his refilled drink.... But  the manager took his food off our bill and my salad was delicious and the atmosphere very inviting.... We will go back and try again"}
{"text":"It was Father's Day today we made reservations no wait called at 10:30 got the time I needed...the waitress was great very attentive!!!!! Love love this place been going for over 15 years now....took a break though when they had changed the recipe for the homemade veggie burger to scared to get now but the turkey burger is good too!!! My dad really enjoyed everything we had the spring rolls and pimento deviled eggs and he got the trout as well as I and also the warm butter cake!!! He enjoyed everything!!! Good Job Village Tavern"}
{"text":"We had a business dinner here and it was excellent.  The restaurant has a great selection of local and regional beers, standard beers and mixed drinks, so everyone was able to get what they wanted. The ahi tuna appetizer (we shared) was excellent, as were the spring rolls and the bacon wrapped scallops.  I had the rib eye steak and it was wonderful.  I asked for it charred on the outside and mooing on the inside and that is exactly how it was delivered.  Marvelously flavored and exceptionally tender.  My sides were equally exceptional and I don;t think anyone left a single thing on their plate. The service was prompt, friendly and fun.  We were looked after without feeling that someone was constantly hovering over us. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Sometimes everything does not go as planned and such was the case in dining at the Village Tavern. This is a meat and potatoes spot and I really wanted something light.   The ahi was just not good. Neither was the wine list. The shrimp taco's were marginal. So, you ask: Why did you order seafood? Sorry, my bad!  Service was nice, but am thinking with as many excellent restaurants as there are in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, I can skip this spot."}
{"text":"Excellent food especially the homemade potato chips with dip. The happy hour is a great bargain."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week excited to try a few things and once I compared the restaurant week selection to their actual menu realized there was less than a 10% savings (less than $3) they were offering. Seems a little shady for the false pretense of getting a good deal for restaurant week.  Due to this I ordered off the regular menu and got their prime rib which was quite tasteful."}
{"text":"Always been a nice little place and never let down with my order. I have had a variety of items on the menu and always pleased. The outside is nice when weather is permitting! Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered santa fe burger with no onions and sweet potato fries! One of the better burgers here in charlotte and the sweet potato fries were awesome!! Village tavern is def a hidden gem in south park. The guacamole on the burger was perfect! Will def be back"}
{"text":"I usually end up coming here when I'm going out to dinner with the padres, but I don't mind always coming here, their menu is extensive and its hard to get bored. I enjoy the ambiance because its dark, soothing, and warm, even when I am here at lunch time. Their booths are very spacious and there are tons of them that I don't think I have ever been at a regular table, hmm, interesting.   Service is alway great and because my parents come here so often they all know them so I always benefit when I roll VIP with them. The food is consistently good and the things that I order the most are: french onion soup, bacon wrapped scallops, ahi tuna sashimi, or their spinach salad. I haven't had much experience with their dessert but have had their warm butter cake which is the bomb.com and the chocolate torte which I have no opinion on because I am not a fan of chocolate.   The bar and patio are popular places to lounge especially during Happy Hour - its always hopin' and in general its an older crowd, but the food and service are great so I will continue to roll in here with my parents - or without them. I like this place, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this gem while shopping in the area. Doesn't look like much on the outside but charming on the inside, great food and wine selection! Next to a cute wine shop. So glad I found this! We had a salad and taco and it was so fresh!"}
{"text":"Make a reservation for lunch with my coworkers. Our server, John, immediately came to take our drink orders and see if we had questions. To my delight, I saw that they had an additional gluten-free menu (you must ask for it). I'm used to have to just pick and choose through restaurants menus for what I believe would be gluten-free so it's nice that they had this option. Their kitchen is not gluten-free from my understanding, however I am not Celiac so it did not alter my decision. I ordered the Gluten-Free Margarita pizza and mango tea. Both delicious! Gluten-free breads tend to have a bit of an issue with texture, but this one was pretty spot on. Thin crust and about 9\" around, it was definitely large enough to share if you ordered an appetizer as well. My coworkers ordered dishes ranging from Spinach Salad, Grilled Salmon, Prime Rib, and Grouper. All had nothing but amazing things to say about their orders. Desert time and we went all out - again. Raspberry Sorbet, Double Decker Cheesecake, Warm Apple Pie, and Butter Cake. HOLY MOLY. I could only eat the sorbet and some bites of the cheesecake, but the reviews from the crowd were all outstanding on every item. But, all in all, the best part about the entire experience was John. He was very attentive to us throughout the entire meal - even balancing another very large group, plus his other tables. He was great with recommendations and answering any questions we had. Others in my group have been going to Village Tavern for years and said that he is the best server they've had there. He genuinely brought this rating to a 5 star. As a group, we all decided that the next time we go back, we will request to be sat in his section. Thanks, John!"}
{"text":"Great place for the patio in summer. There can be a wait for a table but no rushing once you're there."}
{"text":"As new Scottsdale residents we have been trying a number of places near our house and while my parents were visiting we decided to give Village Tavern a try after a neighbor talked about it.  Well, I wish we hadn't.  The food was tasteless and bland.  I should have known right away we were in trouble when I saw how large the menu was.  It is all over the board with fried fish and flat bread pizza to street tacos.    My wife had the spaghetti squash & zucchini.  She said it was terrible.  I had the cowboy burger and was not impressed at all.  The onion ribbons were cold and the bun was not very fresh.  Overall, just not very good at all.    There are much better places to eat right in the same retail center."}
{"text":"Wow this place is a hidden (to me) gem. Probably the best burger in Charlotte (pimento & bacon). Great ambiance (relaxed but nice). Huge patio. Reasonably priced. Absolutely great. Will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Three words: spinach artichoke dip.  When we first walked in here we sat in the bar area to try and watch a basketball game. So it was a more casual section. Not many TV's in the bar area though so I would not go back specifically to watch sports. I would go back for the food though.  We felt a little out of place since we were the youngest ones there....but I really didn't care because it was worth it.  We started with the dip and were sold. It was SO good. Addicting almost. Best dip I have ever had. Very cheesy which I love.  Then I had a salad which was superb as well."}
{"text":"I have been dining at Village Tavern at Gainey Ranch in Scottsdale for several years. I have never had a bad meal or poor service. They have expanded their menu recently. Twice now, I've had the prime rib sandwich. The portion is generous (an actual cut of prime rib, not sliced), cooked to perfection and it comes with one side. The best part- it is reasonably priced! If you have never been, treat yourself to the best lunch or dinner. The only drawback- it gets busy so be prepared to wait but it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"A classic, reliable favorite....the bar is great, just too small! Even in the summer with the snowbirds gone, it is a challenge to squeeze in.....great for them!"}
{"text":"Navigating walking aids like obstacle course contestants, we serpentined our way through the main dining hall until finally arriving at our booth. Everyone in here has got to be at least three-hundred years old.  Some are in the advanced stages of petrification - fossilizing before your very eyes!  I don't care. I like old people. If there's one think I know about old people, it's this; they didn't get to be old eating at Jack in the Box. No sir. Most have enjoyed a fairly healthy diet which is just what The Village serves up.  Try the brick chicken.  A half chicken deboned and cooked under the weight of a brick so it's crispy, flat and more important, tastefully delicious to an extreme. It's so tasty and delicious, you won't even chew it, you'll take the first few bites then eat it like you're a starving varmint; gulping it down insanely fast. I did anyway.  It came with a side of perfectly cooked fresh green beans and a solid pile of buttery good mashed potatoes. The dish was so extraordinary, it was all I could think about this morning as I sipped my coffee, which is normally the time I spend reflecting on how I'm going to traverse four Phoenix freeways on my morning commute without getting shot, killed or maimed."}
{"text":"Great for happy hour!  Food is pretty good, not fab.  Nice looking location with indoor and outdoor seating.  Staff are friendly and responsive.  I have been here 3 or 4 times and each experience was good."}
{"text":"One of the benefits of the culinary golden age that we've experienced over the past 15 or so years is that we are no longer beholden to the corporate chains that push out predictable yet profitable fare.  As it stands this place is a bit of an enigma in that it fits the description above yet still draws pretty impressive crowds.  Maybe it is the area.  Maybe it is because the bulk of the crowd (business types and Paradise Valley retirees) prefer comfort and predictability.  Overall, decent service and solid American fare.  It serves a certain crowd well."}
{"text":"The staff is very attentive and the atmosphere is welcoming. We also enjoy bringing out of town guest here because the menu has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  Came here with a colleague for lunch on a weekday.  Food and service were outstanding (deviled eggs and burgers).  Both the manager and our server Kevin were friendly, gracious and very professional!!!  Can't wait to visit Charlotte again so I can go back!!!!"}
{"text":"The patio matched the food & service; lovely! I enjoyed the bacon wrapped scallops while my fiancé's dish was the Bacon Jam Burger. Mine was delicious and recommend for a plate or to share. The burger was tasty, but I felt it could have used a bit more flavor; maybe grilled on open flame or smoke? The fried on the other hand were excellent: perfect diameter, texture and seasoning."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to find something different to eat. I will admit I was hesitant due to the outside  of the building. We made a great choice. This place is a hidden gem.  His steak was cooked to perfection. It was delicious and no steak sauce needed. I went with the blackened chicken Alfredo. It was absolutely wonderful. It was served with lots of chicken and seasoned perfectly.   We also had the drink specials. My margarita was great and not watered down at all.  This place is beautiful inside and our service was great.   We will visit again soon."}
{"text":"We ate here last Friday night and loved it!  We had a reservation and were seated immediately.  The place has a great atmosphere.  Everything was delicious- from the bread they brought out before our meal to our BBQ chicken flatbread appetizer to our two entrees.  I loved the grilled meatloaf with mashed potatoes and my husband said his ribeye steak was great too.  Our server was very attentive to us as well.  We didn't have to wait long at all for our food to come out to the table.  It was a great dining experience and I'd recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Here on Yelp this restaurant only has two dollar signs and the description says burgers, bar. It had some pretty great review so we thought why not try it out?   From the description we think it's a casual restaurant. My boyfriend and his friend are wearing nice t-shirts, should have worn at least a polo.. From the start of the dinner our waitress Katie treated us like we A. Shouldn't be there and B. Like we couldn't afford to be there. It was actually quite insulting.   We started with drinks, some Moscow mules, they were pretty good but did taste like they were made with ginger ale instead of ginger beer. Our waitress said she would bring us water, but didn't until we asked her again.   She did not come back for at least 15 minutes and when she did she skipped asking us about appetizers and asked if we were ready to order dinner. Which we weren't, but did order the hot crab dip. It was delicious.   After another 10 - 15 minutes she came back to take our order. We asked her what she suggested and she offered several of her favorites from the menu.   I had read that the Mac and cheese was really good so I just had to order that, and the Pimento Bacon Cheeseburger. I was actually disgusted by how much grease was on both the burger and in the mac and cheese. The bottom bun of the burger was soaked in grease, I did not eat it.   My boyfriend ordered the firecracker shrimp tacos and absolutely loved them! Our friend had the shrimp and grits and said they were good, but very greasy also. The three of us are currently suffering from some stomach issues.. If you know what I mean.   Overall I felt like this restaurant was overrated and the service was personally insulting because of what the guys were wearing. Or maybe I'm thinking too much into it and the server just didn't care about making our experience great."}
{"text":"The Village Tavern...the name alone reminds me of some hole in the wall bar. I had a friend that swore by this place, because she use to live by it, and we were actually going to go to Houston's but went the wrong way on Scottsdale ,so we ended up here.   It was the middle of the afternoon and after walking in I felt like i had entered a geriatrics ward, we were the only two people in the place besides the staff that was under 40.  My friend got the wraps which were so bad she could not even eat them, so our server removed them from our bill, I got the chicken club sandwich with pasta salad and iced tea.   Our service for the most part was pretty bad, we had like 5 different people come to our table when we were there, not a 100 percent on who our server actually was, but we would ask one person for a refill and they would say sure then someone else would come back with no drink refill.  Our table was a bit dirty when we sat down. in general this placed sucked, service was poor, the food was garbage, and in general even though this place is huge it truly is like a hole in the wall shit bar restaurant."}
{"text":"Pros: Delicious food, great service, awesome patio seating, good drink specials.  Cons: Sometimes uncomfortable inside (too hot or too cold on multiple occasions).   Overall: Would recommend, can get a little pricey but it's worth it."}
{"text":"For office workday lunches, this is one of my top choices. Great soups, good salads, good sandwiches, and great service by friendly waitstaff and bartenders. (I often eat at the bar to save time). The food is always delicious, especially the soups since I am a soup lover. It's a chain, so my expectations are not especially high and yours shouldn't be either. But if you want the basic fundamentals of tasty food and good service in a comfortable, clean environment, this has them."}
{"text":"The village tavern was awful when I went with family last Sunday.  We opted to sit in the bar as it would save us a 20 minute wait time. I checked the time it was 12:50 when my four top sat down. The service was extremely slow and we had to ask for our glasses to be refilled. I then checked the time to see how long we had been waiting for entrees and it was 1:40. I was so upset I asked for the GM and the assistant GM came out to speak with me. I told him about the awful service and wait time.  He apologized and said the servers had been slammed. I told him that did not excuse poor service. The food arrived as I ended my conversation. If that was not enough someone in our party that ordered a hamburger could not believe his burger was brown on the outside however you could see the meat was raw. The blood was on his bun. I insisted that he speak up and send back as he could get sick consuming raw meat. I think at this point he was disgusted with the restaurant he just wanted to leave.  This used to be my favorite restaurant and my husband and I used to be regulars. I think this will no longer be the case."}
{"text":"Mikey likes it! Yes, after years of passing by the Village Tavern and years of never going in, I've finally visited this local neighborhood tavern and what do I have to say about it? It's A-OK in my book!   When I walked in, it reminded me of other restaurants in the valley in the sense that it's cozy, warm and full of *gasp* snowbirds! The restaurant was hopping with visitors which is a great sign in this economy. They told us the wait would be about 20 minutes, but we weren't even half way done with our beers when they called our name, actually our beeper started buzzing.   The dining room is warm and welcoming. It's crowded in there but once you sit in your seat, you easily forget about those surrounding you. The booths are high and comfortable. The staffers are friendly and attentive but not overbearing.   For food, we began with the crab dip. It came out fresh, hearty and inviting us to dig into it. I liked to see how they gave us small bread slices instead of chips or a large chunk of bread to break off. The crab dip was tasty and savory enough that I could have a little and was still satisfied. Now the menu here is pretty overwhelming because you can pretty much choose anything in any food group to eat based on this menu. But, I ended up going for the fish tacos. I don't quite know what kind of fish was in the tacos but they were filling and satisfying. I didn't try the ribs but caught a glimpse of them and if they tasted anything like they looked, then those are some delicious ribs!   So to end my tale about my introduction to the Village Tavern, this is a great neighborhood restaurant that I'd happily visit again."}
{"text":"Oh man. Not so much. Perhaps it was all the coffee I was sipping throughout the morning that curbed my appetite but I just wasn't able to get through my meal.  First, this tavern gets super busy. The place was packed when we had lunch yesterday. It's a mixed crowd of folks but I was particularly fond of the older ladies playing cards after eating their lunch.  We started lunch off with a quesadilla appetizer. Huge chunks of chicken, cheesy, delicious. I then ordered their onion-mushroom burger for lunch. The burger was cooked just how I wanted it but it was seriously lacking in flavor. Perhaps the salt gods are getting to me from the home cooking. Kudos for keeping it fresh (so I think) but I just didn't find the burger to be too tasty. It's not like me just eating a little over half of my meal but that's where I left it. And it really wasn't a hunger thing either because I hate to leave food on the plate.  I wouldn't mind going back as I'm sure there are plenty of good options but I don't think I'll be choosing a burger."}
{"text":"We went here for a work lunch.  It was a little pricy for lunch.  Calamari appetizer had decent flavor but texture was a bit rubbery.  I had the chicken broccoli pasta which I would have enjoyed more if it hadn't been covered in some kind of spice (paprika maybe?  It was red.)  I wish places didn't think alfredo pasta needs color.  It doesn't.  When people order alfredo, we understand it's going to be white.  You don't need to put spices or herbs on top.    Atmosphere here is great.  Service was slightly slow.  It took a long time to get our drinks, but our waiter was certainly friendly.  A couple coworkers had salads and said they were delicious.  They are also known for their seafood.  My boss had a salad with salmon on it and said it was the best salmon she'd ever tasted."}
{"text":"Went back for the bacon!!!!  Since I was hungrier this time, ordered the Chilean sea bass with sticky rice.  It was cooked and seasoned perfectly, melted in your mouth delicious.    Would order this again and again with of course a side of the bacon."}
{"text":"The food is good, but nothing super amazing that I have to go there all the time. We tried the pimento cheese deviled eggs which were disappointing to me because I really love both of those foods separately. The consistency was not to my liking and it basically tasted only like cheese.  I ordered the ahi tuna salad, which I have had before, but this time I felt like my tuna should have been colder considering its almost raw. It don't want to eat room temperature tuna. We ordered a few sides for my child to eat and I loved how thin the apples were sliced. It was easy for him to eat by hand and they were so fresh.  I do enjoy the vibe of the restaurant though. The dining area is dimmed and not to noisy.  Plus you can pretty much wear anything in there, which I find a pleasant change from many Scottsdale restaurants because I don't always want to get dressed up to eat."}
{"text":"Tried the Village Tavern after reading good things about it. When we arrived the place was packed. So obviously, this place is doing something right. We sat in the huge dining room and were quickly greeted by our server. We ordered a bottle of wine and started to look at the menu. There were so many different options including meat, seafood and different comfort food. We opted for the filets and they were nicely chared crisped on the outside and a warm pink inside. Perfect done for Medium Rare. We will be back"}
{"text":"Do you need a great happy our near Gainey Ranch? Well this is it, top shelf booze and great apps for cheap. Great service too!"}
{"text":"WHAT A SHAME!!!!!   Our neighborhood restaurant of choice,  since the day it opened,  must have some sort of NEW management.  Tonight was our third and final attempt to continue choosing it for a quick, delicious, full service, enjoyable evening out.  We have been seeing changes in recipes...smaller portions, the amount of blue cheese on salads, changes in service, and general attention to detail.  All somewhat subtle changes, but nevertheless changes.  Our bread tonight was SO stale we could not tear the roll apart.   It took a serrated steak knife.  We ordered salad and filet (our usual) and received all items at the same time. Usually salad is served first.  Our steak was cold - meaning it had probably been sitting out for a while.  We are so disappointed.  As one of the previous negative reviews stated....the customer was told when she asked what was going on, was that they were trying to save money.  All these money saving techniques may not be in your best interest.    We are not alone in our feelings.  Goodbye!"}
{"text":"This place was good! The only thing I didn't enjoy was a mule called \"blackberry buck\" but the waitress Had no problem switching it out for a different drink. I had the baby back ribs which were AMAZING but needed a little extra BBQ! GET THE BUTTER CAKE!!!!! It was seriously one of the best desserts I've ever had. So delicious."}
{"text":"We walked to The Village Tavern from the hotel and it was worth the walk. We ordered the pimento burger and tavern burger as take out. Both burgers were very juicy and cooked to perfection. You know it's good when the juice is all over your face and fingers. The bread had the perfect soft toast texture to add to the deliciousness.  The ambiance was light and friendly. There were people dressed up and people with t shirts Nd shorts. Everyone who worked there from the hostess to the bar tender were friendly and appeared happy to seems. The secret sauce on the tavern burger is quite spicy but the heat goes away quickly. The onions on the pimento cheese burger make it sweet I would definitely order food from there again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, nice wine list, good service. Classy place"}
{"text":"Great place and super friendly ... I love that from outside it doesn't look like it would be a nice restaurant ...but I was very surprised. It's a cute date night/ business dinner kinda space also I did expect more from the food but it wasn't horrible..."}
{"text":"The crowd here tends towards older classier types.  (Think business men or the ladies who lunch crowd).  The drink are divine but the menu tends towards the safe/traditional.  Two drinks, an appetizer and two entrees ran about $90.00  Not super economical but tasty.  My bigger complaint is about the interior, for that kind of money, I don't want to be seated at vinyl booths and be reminded of the buffet at Paris.   The menu is heavy on the steaks and seafood.  Had the prime rib which was super tasty but could have been a little warmer.  The trout was delicious with teriyaki sauce.  The teriyaki sauce is the same used on the bacon-wrapped scallops which was strange as scallops usually need very little adornment.  The scallops were delicious but seemed a little pricey at 10.00 for three pieces.  Skipped dessert at my Pear Martini did the trick.   Overall, I might come back for HH during the week (when drinks are half off) otherwise this place is a little out of the way for my taste.  (It's in the Gainey Village Shops just outside of the Hyatt Gainey Ranch)"}
{"text":"They are back in my good graces. It seems like Brian took care of the \"don't forget about your year around locals). The food and service is excellent. A great neighborhood spot with a menu for everyone."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio to enjoy a refreshing beverage. Shared the spinach dip with my spouse -- it wasn't bad, but the cilantro, which was prominently listed on the menu as an ingredient, was undetectable. I suspect it was omitted from our batch of dip. Service was spot-on, so I won't deduct a star for the missing cilantro. I would probably enjoy that lovely patio on a beautiful day with a solitary piece of toast."}
{"text":"This place is solid.  Happy hour, lunch or dinner are all good.  Had dinner here tonight.  The marinated flank steak was delicious with the sweet soy garlic dipping sauce."}
{"text":"We go here regularly. Without reservations the wait would be very long. They are on Open Table which is very convenient. The food is consistently well prepared and the service is excellent. We visit weekly as it is down the street from our home. Based on many visits, I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot near the office.  Decent beer selection and tasty food choices."}
{"text":"I could not decide if my recent experiences are a 3 or 4. I eat here a lot but recently I have noticed something. The Prime Rib sandwich was very fatty, thin and had little meat on it. The Chicken Mexican salad had almost all beans but little lettuce. When I asked my server what was going on, she told me that they are trying to save money. I will try going again in a few days and see if it is the same story. Today I ate my prime rib sandwich without the bread because there was very little mat to put on it. Come on Village Tavern, I have never had a negative experience here, your servers are great, I love the ambiance but once you start cutting corners, that spells the end."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch after deciding a 45 minute wait at Terrace Cafe was not worth our time. They let us sit ouside on their giant patio on a gorgeous windy Charlotte spring day. With the tree tops in full bloom, it almost felt like we were in another country. Really great location.  The staff was really great and friendly and did a good job checking on us.  The only real reason I am giving this a three star is because for the price, I was not really impressed with the food. And above all else that matters. Please don't misread me. The food was not bad at all. There was nothing wrong with it. I just think for what it was, it could have been much less in cost. That is just my personal opinion and I'm sure that is not true for everyone or perhaps even across their menu board."}
{"text":"First visit to Village Tavern tonight.  Less than auspicious start --- seated ourselves in lounge area, which is open seating, first come/first serve -- and after 10+ min. of not being waited on and greeted, got up and were walking out.  Mentioned to mgr., Jesus, who happened to be on patio talking w some customers a few ft. away, that we would have loved to have dined with them tonight, but were leaving due to no one serving us.  Without hesitation, and very apologetic, Jesus offered to take care of our meals if we decided to stay, which after some coaxing, we did.  And I am happy to report what a good decision that really was.    Meals were excellent --- filet mignon for myself, and ribeye for my son, w sides of asparagus and Mac n cheese, which was flavorful, one of the best we've ever tasted.  Service also excellent.  Our server, Jonathan was outstanding, extremely knowledgeable and not afraid to pass along his recommendations, from wine, to appetizer salad, to meals, which I very much appreciate in a server, especially when dining somewhere for the first time.    Full menu with many possibilities.  Whatever you're in the mood for --- steak/prime rib, seafood, burgers, wonderful salads (highly recommend the Tavern Salad), diverse selection of appetizers, great wine/beer selections, and all of these, surprisingly reasonable, considering the quality, and amt. of food you get.  You are warned!  Portions are aplenty!  Ambiance is also excellent in the Village Tavern.  Lively atmosphere, but person sitting across from you easily heard.  We will be back to the Village Tavern, and very soon.  Thank you, Jesus, and Jonathan, for a wonderful first experience, outstanding meals, outstanding service."}
{"text":"(Update) What I can say is the only issue is the service. Sit at the bar or try to get anyone that has hair or has an American accent to count on your service being great or better than great.  I Love their food and their management staff when something goes wrong, they go out of their way to fix it.  Use caution they have so much on their menu all the ingredients are not listed on all items at this time, so if you  order something like a contract make sure you read the fine print that not everything is listed.  Please check it out and keep your expectations reasonable and I do not think you will be disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"I am surprised at all the good service reviews for VT.  I have given this place a few tries and have not once had good service.  Usually when I experience \"bad\" service, I look for ways for the bartender/waiter to redeem themselves during the process.  Unfortunately, I have never had that here.  I checked the reviews here because this place is one of the few that I have dined at in Arizona that, for lack of a better phrase, left a bad taste in my mouth. As far as the food, I was never too impressed with that either, but the reviews say otherwise from my fellow Yelpers.    I will say that my last experience was so bad it prompted me to write the corporate office and they were responsive and sent me a $25 gift card.  Maybe I will give them a 3rd chance based on everyone's feedback."}
{"text":"After I posted my 2 star review, I was surprised and happy to get a message from the management. They ask if I would like a call to discuss the issue and I accepted their offer. Unfortunately, I never got the call. The customer service continues to be lacking with poor follow through."}
{"text":"We decided to try out Village Tavern for the first time this past Saturday.  We went for a late lunch/early dinner in mid-afternoon.  Unfortunately we never had a chance to try the food or experience the service. Our hostess was cold and uninspired and after sitting for over 10 minutes, without even a greeting, we decided to leave.  Lots of process breakdowns and unacceptable customer service lead to this rating and with the volumes of great restaurants in the area with focus on customer service, this is one that can be missed.  The management apologized and attempted to remedy the situation as we got into our car, but by that time it was too late as there seemed to be a lack of focus on a basic greeting and we will be with you shortly or let me ask my fellow teammates to help me while I am busy.  Not the kind of place that makes you feel welcome.  Maybe it was a bad time of day, or bad set of circumstances, but you need to be prepared for operating hours."}
{"text":"The first time I've really felt compelled to write a review.  Food was excellent.  The ribs were fall off the bone and all 4 at the table agreed that my father in law's steak was one of the best we'd ever eaten.     Special comment goes out to our waitress Laura.  She was excellent.  If I was still in sales management, I would have offered her a job on the spot.  She was both friendly and profressional and I really look forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today Ordered caprice salad and 5oz fllet with ff and green beans Everything was great and seasoned very well Beans were ok but I like them a little more crisp Dessert was carrot cake very good and very sweet and served warm different also had expresso was ok but they need to make foam   however was served with a lemon which is the correct way Norwood my server was good Place very busy Will return"}
{"text":"Couldn't be more horrible.  Cold food. Loud. The manager is a putz. Do they know how far down hill they have become?  A year ago great.  New ownership? Did I say horrible food?  Warning: avoid the calamari.  Horrible."}
{"text":"I should have known when we tried three or four other restaurants within a mile of this place and they all had 1-2 hour waits, and this one had no wait, that should have been an indicator! This is a place for people to go, when they want a really nice atmosphere, with decent service, but don't really care about  quality food. For the prices, $100 to feed my family (2 adult meals, 1 app, 4 kids meals and 6 soft drinks, no alcohol, no dessert), the food should have been much, much better. Every thing taste pre-made, like out of a can or jar, not pre-made at the restaurant. It wasn't bad food, just way over priced for low end average. I could have gone to Chili's and had better food for less than half the price. Or I could have gone right around the corner to Rooster's or Bricktops and for the same amount of cash, had excellent food. If the Village Tavern wants to see me again, I hope they took a picture, because I will never go back."}
{"text":"The 3 of us were visiting Scottsdale for a few days. I looked around on Yelp for a restaurant that had a menu that suited all of our tastes and with great ratings.  We had the deviled eggs, pork chop, filet mignon and chicken Marsala . For desert we tried the warm butter cake.  The food was over the top and the service exceptional. Kristen was our amazing server and was the most professional and attentive.  Great ambiance, great food and great service.  Thank you, Kristen!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a sophisticated and casual atmosphere with a lot of different menu choices and great service, this is the place. Located in the Gainey Center Shopping area, the Tavern is always fulll of locals and in season, snow birds congregate here. The food ranges from wonderful, creative salads (always fresh) to well prepared fish and meat dishes. The best part of the restaurant is the lodge like atmosphere (the owners are from Colorado), the two sided fireplace that backs to the bar and dining room, and the big, comfy wooden booths that hold 6-8 people. The service is great, too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I joined another couple for Sunday brunch a couple of weeks ago.  There was a ton of nice outdoor seating and the menu looked very promising.  I ordered an omelet, which I couldn't wait to try.  Well, let me rephrase that...I could, and I did wait.  It took around 35-40 minutes to get the food for our table.  Most disappointing was the fact that we never even got an apology for the food taking so long.    With that being said, once we got the food it was actually pretty good.  Although I was so hungry that it didn't have to be that great to scarf it down.  Another positive was that the prices were very reasonable.  I will probably try it again and hope to have a better experience, but it will have to be on a day that I can eat a snack before I go..."}
{"text":"Decent spot....nothing special though.  We went at 3:30 pm on a Sunday and the place was pretty dead, and the people that were there were mostly retirees.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was prompt and friendly.  My margarita was pretty good as was the spaghetti squash entree I ordered.  The BF had the cowboy burger and fries which he loved!  Since we live in Chandler we probably wouldn't make a special trip, but if we found ourselves in the area needing a quick bite, we might stop in again."}
{"text":"Mmm... 4 stars for half priced cocktail Thursdays. Breaking my longest running New Years Resolution of no-hard-liquor here was worth it. Had a pama-tini and it was girly and delicious.   Crab dip was great (LOTS of crab meat), bruschetta was a-ok (bread could've been more flavorful), home made potato chips probably tasted better when they first came out, and calamari was a tad too crispy. Flowing drinks, fantastic patio, Sinatra impersonator = pretty cool place to chill after work.   Although, note that if you don't meet the visual requirements of the hostesses, they'll give you the up and down (and not in a good way)."}
{"text":"Pricey, high class, good quality food! Not too pricey though. You get what you pay for. I tried the Small Plate Sampler appetizer and Filet Mignon for my lunch. The food is rich in taste, very delicious. Service is quick and very friendly. The place is crowded for a reason. Interior is very clean, cozy, warm, and a bit dim. Easy to find. There's absolutely nothing to complain about but lots to remember as you leave the place."}
{"text":"Been here many times! Great food, great service. Amazing happy hour. Hosts have always been welcoming, servers always friendly. Robert at the bar will make your drinks just right!"}
{"text":"Always great service and fantastic food.  Consistently top notch.  Appetizer and happy hour specials great value for early dinner.  Locals love it and snowbirds keep the place jumping."}
{"text":"So last night we were here for dinner, one of my favorite places for prime rib, the food has always been good however....I  got up to use the bathroom and both were out of order,( these things can happen) so I  asked the manager where I could use the bathroom hoping he would say you can use our employee bathroom; he said your welcome to go over to the Hyatt ( mind you, not next door but the Hyatt which is several blocks away and way more inconvenient !) Needless to say I was shocked so I asked the hostess if he was for real ? She was very nice and led me to the employees bathroom, no problem!! But seriously the manager on duty on Friday Oct. 13th needs to be a little nicer especially those that continue to dine there. I've not seen this type of customer service before, just hope he learns a little ettiquite."}
{"text":"Great lunch special!!!! 8oz Prime Rib with two sides for $15.50!!! Can't beat it. One weekends it's $3 mimosas and although the crowd is older they have a little patio and the games are on in the bar."}
{"text":"Nice place!  The Cobb salad is great and they have some real good happy hour deals.  The staff is friendly and overall a good vibe."}
{"text":"Have been here twice on business trips and both meals were very pleasant experiences.  Great wedge salad really hit the spot on the latest visit."}
{"text":"Wife and I went here one night to try it out. It is down the road from our house. We went in and we were the youngest people in there by about 30 years. This place caters to an older crowd. We sat at the bar and the service was good. The bartenders were very attentive and helpful. The food was meh. I probably will not go back, just not my thing."}
{"text":"GREAT Patio! Fantastic atmosphere!  Daily specials... my favorite? Thursday's 1/2 priced liquor drinks AND appetizers! Heck to the yes!  I enjoy sitting outside on the vast patio in the comfy furniture or hanging out at the cozy bar. The food is good-all I've ever eaten were the appetizers, and they're fantastic!"}
{"text":"Nice lunch stop. Had the crab cakes. It was good and service was friendly and prompt.  Maybe my rating would be even higher if I was there for dinner and cocktails. Will stop again when in the area."}
{"text":"I came here to meet a group for happy hour.  Everyone wanted to go here, saying \"yeah!  Let's meet at Village Tavern!  I love that place\"  I had no idea what to expect.  When I first looked up Village Tavern on the map, I thought \"Ok, that's interesting...it looks like it's in an office building.  I'm not sure how fun this place is going to be.\"  It took about five minutes of being there to fall in love.  The food was great (except they left a label on the lettuce, which was weird, but I pushed it off to the side).  I had a salad, although I really wanted to order a burger.  Ranch dressing was really good and I would come back just to find more things to dip in the ranch!  Wine selection was pretty strong.  Great bottle and by-the-glass selection.  I opted for a glass on the Slingshot...you definitely can't go wrong!  It's a delicious red.  Village Tavern has some great weekly specials, too.  Overall, a great place to come on a date or to meet a group.  The bar area is pretty big and they have several communal tables.  When it gets warmer, I definitely want to check out the patio!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and was not impressed. I ordered the clam chowder and the barbecue chicken flatbread. Both were meh. Our waiter was really friendly though. I am not sure I will be back especially for the price. For both items, it was around $20. Definitely not worth $20."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've dined at Village Tavern.  When we asked our Mom where she wanted to go for her birthday, she said Village Tavern for some Ribs...ok!  We ordered:  Onion Ribbons, $6.75 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/village-tavern-scottsdale?select=uaKWlf-gzyoiSXaPYbQevw#uaKWlf-gzyoiSXaPYbQevw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/village-tavern-scottsdale?select=JbZTcZDE_MsKEIDqpgSIPA#JbZTcZDE_MsKEIDqpgSIPA  BBQ Baby Back Ribs w/Fries & Slaw, $19.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/village-tavern-scottsdale?select=PAMMNKUE9Ve70qT4-OrW9A#PAMMNKUE9Ve70qT4-OrW9A http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/village-tavern-scottsdale?select=yHys__UE-eiDCkZzKR_UGQ#yHys__UE-eiDCkZzKR_UGQ  The Onion Ribbons are very good and addicting.  The Ribs were cooked just right with the meat falling off the bone and the BBQ Sauce adding the right amount of sweet, tangy goodness.  It's what we were all craving.  At the end of the meal, the server surprised Mom with a Chocolate Cake and Vanilla Ice Cream.  She enjoyed it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/village-tavern-scottsdale?select=Ua5o47AjXqSjcmg5HJrZjw#Ua5o47AjXqSjcmg5HJrZjw  Overall, it was a nice family dinner.  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"I didn't know the room service from the gainey suites hotel came from here but it was just decent.  I don't know if its fair to really judge this plae since I came here for a work dinner and the menu was already preset.  I had the pork chops which were a bit too dry for my liking but the mashed potatoes were fantastic.  They an out of baked potatoes so I can only imagined the mashed ones were from a box or some kind of random mixture....  the desserts were very hearty huge american desserts."}
{"text":"Not sure why I forget about this restaurant, but I do.  It has been in the Rotunda Building for as long as I remember.   Today, I met my friend, John L, for a long overdue catch up session/lunch.  Could not find a salad that I wanted, mainly due to bacon bacon and more bacon, as well as other items that are not my favorites.  So, I got the grilled salmon with green beans and sweet potato fries.  They nailed it.  The salmon was cooked exactly as I requested.  The beans were delicious and the fries tasted like they were coated with cinnamon sugar.  What gets better than that?  The fries were served with a honey mustard sauce for dipping.  Yum yum yum!    This restaurant has a certain classy style.  It is not stuffy, but not too casual.  Service was efficient, however the server could have been a bit more engaging.  While I wish there were some different salad options, there are many other good dishes on the menu.  Plus, I realize that most people are huge bacon fans.  The bar area is elegant and I think it would be fun to just go sit there sometime.  I need to return here more often."}
{"text":"Let me preface this with We Love Village Tavern!   We've been going there nearly monthly for over 4 years. This last time, our service was just terrible! If this had been our 1st visit we'd never go back. It was interesting to note that all the tables around us that ordered alcohol received stellar service. MMMMMM It started with ordering drinks, sorry only Arnold Palmer's for the table. Then appetizer, which was great. We had the Colorado Chips. Homemade potato chips with bacon, cheese and BBQ sauce. How bad can that be??? Then we ordered our entrees. But NO ONE ever removed the dirty dishes from or appetizers. MMM... So we flagged down someone to fill our water glasses, all the while staring at dirty dishes on our table. Finally we did find our server to refill our drinks, thinking he'd take the plates with him, but NO, there they sat. Finally when our entrees were served we asked that the dirty plates be removed. Got a roll of they eyes, almost like saying, \"that's not my job\". But she took the plates non the less. Not 1 single time during our dinner did our server or anyone else ask how our meal was or how we were doing. We did everything but fill our own water glasses. BUT, the tables on both sides and across from us were attended to like royalty! My partner even ran into the manage in the men's room, and discussed our 'lack' of service. Did he stop by the table after that??? NO, or at least not until we'd paid the tab. He then stopped by and gave us 2 cards. 1 for a free appetizer and 1 for a free dessert on our next visit. So, let me get this right....you are asking me to come spend more money with you in order for you to make up for the terrible service I received this time? Well as I started this tirade with, if this was the 1st visit with Village Tavern, I'd NEVER go back.  But, I've been going there for years and years and years. Even before moving to AZ we'd dined with them. Starting back in 2003 when we were on a vacation here from Chicago.  Will I go back? Yes with trepidation, but I will go back."}
{"text":"Best place in Scottsdale for Prime Rib Period!!  Decently priced menu, and very cool bar and drink menu.  We have been coming here for a long time and only once had a bad experience (which was totally due to the crappy server).  I would recommend this place all day long, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent!   Food, service, ambiance outstanding. Quiet inside with a large patio away from traffic.  Well done!"}
{"text":"I had the prime rib which was very salty. The butter cake is to die for. Service was great."}
{"text":"If you are from Maryland, DO NOT get the crab cake sandwich. You will be disappointed. Think of McDonalds Fish sandwich. The bread was not toasted. The bun was like a blue ribbon cookout burger bun. The crab cake, wasn't a cake, it was a patty. Smh... it was terrible. Granted it was not called \"Maryland\" crab cake sandwich... but still should have had more flavor and better presentation. Bottom line---Do Not get the crab cake!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in about 3pm yesterday and sat in the bar (this was our first time here). It wasn't busy by any means. There were probably 5 guys sitting at the end of the bar top and a group of about 8 to 10 guys sitting at some bar tables pushed together. My husband and I sat at a table close to the larger group of guys; I guess that was our first mistake because then we just sat there, and sat there, and sat there. The busser walked right passed our table to go close the patio shades, NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, red haired bartender makes direct eye contact with me and proceeds to leave the bar, again NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT!!! Brown haired bartender makes eye contact and... NO FLIPPEN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT!!! Are you serious? I guess our money is not as good as that coming from the 50 something year old men acting like fools over a stupid college football game! We peaced out and went to Scottsdale Beer Company!!! That place was awesome!! We'll unfortunately never come back to this place. Scottsdale Beer Company here we come!"}
{"text":"I'm a little torn on this review because the food was excellent and the happy hour wine special was absolute perfection!  I had family coming into town so before they came, my husband and I decided to stop in for a quick bite. The waitress we first had was PHENOMENAL. She told us about the specials and frequently returned to make sure everything was going well. The food was delicious and everything was hot and well prepared.  Then, my family got in early and decided to meet us there. We moved to a larger table where Colin took over. That's when things took a turn for the worse. He tried to impress us with wine selections and menu choices and was a bit pushy. The service was awful. Waited for drinks for a good 10-15 minutes which was insane because it was dead on a Wednesday night at 8:30. We constantly had to remind him to bring us drinks and frequently ran out and had to wait for him to show up.   I would like to come back because the food really was great. Everyone in my family was impressed however, the service needs a bit of an upgrade. At least for this individual anyway."}
{"text":"I've been coming to The Village Tavern now for quite some time and it's SOLID every time. Service is prompt and the food is awesome. Never had anything that wasn't. Some of my favorites - Prime Rib of course (and if you order the sandwich at lunch time, it's a full thick slice of prime rib on bread and about a buck cheaper than the lunch prime rib, and it's the same thing!), the taco salad is delish (and you don't even need the dressing). It's a must if you're looking for someplace great. AND for upcoming Mother's Day, they're having an extremely reasonable brunch, about $20 less than the resorts and I bet the food will be superb!  Oh yeah, one more thing, private parties, they're great at. Hosted a party there and they're very accommodating!   Can go casual or have a nice romantic dinner. Atmosphere is nice!"}
{"text":"In the few years I have been visiting Charlotte this ranks as one of the tops. We went for dinner and I liked the atmosphere right away. The menu is large with good options to please all palettes. I ordered the prime rib and there are 2 options 12 and 16 ounces with 2 sides and bear aisle or creamy horseradish. A man we assumed was the owner walked around and asked diners about their meal. Really everything was excellent. Will definitely repeat!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  They have a great food selection so there is something for everybody and everything we've had has been delicious. The apple cobbler is the best thing I have ever had. They also have a great large outside patio"}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed the service people were very friendly. The lemon drop I ordered was delicious. My hubby loved his chicken quesadilla. I had street corn and crab cakes over salad and the crab cakes were delicious. Fresh food and great service. I would give 5 star but they do not do military discount and the salad under my crab cakes left much to be desired. A Must go"}
{"text":"We were staying next door in the Gainey Suites, and decided to try this place. We ordered beer, baked brie, and BBQ pork sliders. Salvador was the waiter for our group of 7, and we were not disappointed with the service or the food."}
{"text":"It's just too crowded & way outside the South Park Piedmont circle area. Food is mediocre & drinks aren't strong. It's the place you regret going to because you're completely isolated. I know crowded normally means place to be, but that's not the case here. Plus the staff isn't very helpful- from the gals at the door to wait staff. Sure if you work next door it's probably great, but don't waste your time making it a destination."}
{"text":"I didn't set any high expectations after reading through the previous reviews and the name really doesn't do the restaurant and favors either.   However I was pleasantly surprised.  The interior was dark and homey like some kind of hunting lodge with large booths and a Fireplace separating the two side of the restaurant and bar.   The menu had a lot of items to choose from. I decided on the Blackened Salmon Sandwich per the waiters recommendation and the fact that he told me that they fly in fresh seafood daily. (see pics)   My Sandwich was nothing less than Amazing! Really that was the most Delicious Salmon I think I have ever tasted, it was so fresh and juicy and perfectly grilled, WOW!  Not to mention the Sesame encrusted bun from heaven that it lay upon and the most beautifully fresh sliced tomato I have EVER seen on a sandwich ANYWHERE!  I chose pasta salad as my side instead of fries, this pasta salad was really fresh and tasty with sliced carrots, olives and peppers, dressed in a basil vinaigrette.   My daughter chose the Cheeseburger, as usual.(see pics) Even though I don't eat red meat I could see how juicy and flavorful her burger was. It was cooked to a perfect medium and came served on the same heavenly bun that I had, she was oohing and aahing over every bite.   Lucky for me I had a gift card to the VT or I may have never even bothered to try it.   I will be back for sure and if they keep up with this experience they may just get another star!"}
{"text":"We walked in on a Thursday evening for dinner without a reservation. No problem. We were greeted warmly and seated immediately. Our waitress (I think her name is Melissa) was very helpful with descriptions of items on the menu and recommendations. My husband ordered a local craft beer (25oz/great value) and we got a bottle of wine for the table. The wine was a great Malbec (Argentinian I believe). We both ordered the steak au poivre. IT WAS DIVINE!!!!!!  The sautéed spinach was the best we have ever had. For dessert we ordered the carrot cake. It was super moist with delicious cream cheese icing. Fabulous dinner!!!  We absolutely recommend Village Tavern, and we will certainly be going back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant.  Flank steak sandwich, spinach dip, potato chips, and the tort.  I always want all of them and can never decide.  A must try.  And definitely sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"The appetizers were better than my entrée.  I had the ribeye. It definitely was not a prime steak. It was cooked properly, but a bit tough. The service is attentive.   I like the wine list."}
{"text":"I tried Village Tavern for the first time  last week. We were promptly and politely greeted when entering .  Our waitress was very nice and offered up suggestions since it was our first time . She also was very attentive with our drinks.  The nachos were good . A lot of food though and our waitress warned us of that. Our entrees were really great as well.   The environment was nice and quiet . The building itself pretty cool too because it has the wood beams showing on the ceiling . I would definitely go back here."}
{"text":"I met my cousin from San Diego here cause it's was close to her hotel.  This was my first time here too and we were not disappointed.  It was 5 o'clock on a Thursday evening and we were warmly greeted by the hostess.  We were told it would probably be a 30 min wait which actually was only a 10 min wait and after getting drinks at the bar, we were called that our table was ready.  I had the crab cake entrée which was totally the best crab cakes I've ever had!  My cousin loved her two appetizers that she had and we even enjoyed the happy hour house wine that they had on special for $4.00.  Service was great too!  Overall, it was a great pick and I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I went here for a wedding!!! There food was so good that i had to put them on my bookmark list for the next time I'm in charlotte"}
{"text":"This was my first time at the village tavern.  It was just ok.   The Asian chicken salad was awful.  It had a weird dressing. Thank goodness my husband was willing to switch with the crab sandwich.  That was ok.   He didn't even finish the salad.  The best thing there was the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Came across this place while walking from the hotel to get a bite to eat after checking in.   What a cute place!!   Very nicely decorated and our server was very friendly.  Went at about 10PM and were charged $4 for 2 bottles of Miller Lite.  Can't beat that!!  The beef nachos were good but the prime rib sliders were super yummy!!!!    Happy hour here looks like a great deal as well. $5 premium drinks and $2 bottles of domestics.  A person could have a great time here! We sat in the bar area which had a bunch of TVs for anyone wanting to watch a sporting event.   But they also have a dining area that's a little more intimate."}
{"text":"August 2016 - this restaurant is usually very good.  We were there at 5pm on a Sunday with 8 people.  The round table they gave us was way too small for us - when our entrees arrived, we had to consolidate plates so we could all eat.  Service was terrible!  The server was very nice and friendly to us, but either she or the kitchen needs a lot of work if they expect to have us come back.  Entrees came very late - one entrée didn't come until 15 minutes after all the rest were served. Food was generally good, burgers were warm, not hot.  We did complain to the manager on duty - about the service and the size of the table.  He offered and we accepted free desserts for our inconveniences.  What a mistake that was! It took 20 minutes for them to arrive, and those of us who ordered the mini sundaes had a cup of milk instead of ice cream.  We have all been there before, many times, and don't know what happened this time.  Perhaps Sunday is too busy a day for them to handle .... although there were many empty tables.  We did ask for 5 separate checks up front, and we know that is inconvenient, but should not create these kinds of issues.  We love this restaurant, but they need to work these things out!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the great ambience of VT last night & had a wonderful time. Kevin, our waiter made the evening even more enjoyable. My wife had Chicken Marsala & I had one of the best blue cheeseburgers in years. Hand cut, hot, salted chips added another layer of taste. Great selection of wines by the glass & Kevin advised us that Wednesday in 1/2 off all wines all day Wednesday!  Caution: the two desserts we had could have been shared, HUGE! Freshly baked butter cake w/raspberry sauce & ice cream & hot apple cobbler w/ice cream could have fed four people."}
{"text":"Last night I was craving steak after a long day at work and looked on Yelp for some reviews. I was not disappointed! ! The prime rib was out of this world . I haven't had a steak like this since Kansas City. The wine was 1/2 off Wednesdays so a bottle of their Italian blend matched perfectly. I was craving chocolate and ordered the chocolate cake as dessert. Wow!! The combination of fudge and brownie melted in my mouth.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"We came on Fathers Day to this establishment and was nothing but impressed the wait time was a little long but that was only because it was Fathers Day so it wasn't to long, and they always kept us updated about the table. I had the salmon with green beans and Mac N cheese. I asked for well done Salmon and it was cooked to perfection the sauce was good. We had the spring rolls as a appetizer and that was good. The best of the meal was the Warm Butter Cake...When I come back I have to get that it was so good. I would be definitely coming back"}
{"text":"We came here for date night with some other couples. The menu was great with a large variety. We had pimento burgers and they exceeded our expectations with flavor! The sweet po fries were great, nice and crispy. The people who ordered steaks and sides enjoyed the flavor and cook of the meat. This place was great for our large group. Next time we'll try the desserts. I forgot to mention, the server was a hoot! So nice, funny, and polite"}
{"text":"Ok, this is our go-to place to eat. The menu has something for everyone. We usually eat here once a week. The spring rolls appetizer are great. Shrimp and grits, excellent. The green beans are very good. For desert, get the butter cake.  Let me say that again butter cake!! How in the world can you go wrong with butter cake? You'll be glad you went here."}
{"text":"My wife and I and another coupled enjoyed lunch at the Village Tavern yesterday.  The service was great and the food was even better. I don't think anyone left a thing on their plate.  I had the shrimp and grits.  I'm a huge fan of this dish (I tend to think of it as a poor man's risotto).  The grits were perfect.  Creamy with just enough 'grittiness' to give them the perfect mouth feel.   They were generous with the shrimp and they were cooked well.  My only gripe, and it's a small one, is that the shrimp were a bit on the salty side (this seems to be a trend lately in several restaurants I've visited).    My wife had the Forentine Omlette.  It's a simple dish with spinach, gruyere cheese and some tomatoes.  The omlette was cooked perfectly and the ingredients were fresh.  Since she's vegan, and without her even having to mention it, they substituted a fresh and generous fruit cup for the hash browns.  The other couple also thoroughly enjoyed their meals.  The grilled meatloaf (yes, this is really a thing) was delicious as were the sides.  The Eggs Benedict looked beautiful but I'm just not a fan of Hollandaise sauce so I didn't try it.  The prices were what I call 'Scottsdale' reasonable.  Less expensive than the hotel restaurants but a little more than a Fridays or Cheesecake Factory.  That said, the food was far better than at either of those restaurants so I consider it a good value.  Overall, it was an absolutely lovely lunch experience and it will be a go to place for us."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to Stake house but they have repeatedly ignored my request to store and serve their wine at the proper temperature. Funny thing is that the Butter for the bread is colder then the wine.  saying that the food is great and the service and atmosphere is good for a date night I would not write this place off just for the wine but come on a $100 wine fridge would bump this place up to 4 stars for me.  Not a bad review but the management needs to pull their head out and Serve their wine at the proper temperature."}
{"text":"Having dined from the Mark Hopkins to the Windows  on  the World in Manhattan I must say this was the most horrendous culinary experience of a lifetime. The worst part of the 80min wait was the obnoxious, pretentious indifference of the \"manager\" Jay Horton. Not only did he not care for the concerns of the patrons but had the nerve to belittle his customer. Absolutely unacceptable.  Will Never be back here again! If you don't take care of your customers, somebody else will! My friend raved, but you've Lost some regulars. Too much competition for this kind of Nonsense! I can generally excuse slow (2+hrs)and even poor service but the flippant indifference and condescending attitude of the individual who's supposed to \"make it right\". No."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love this place! Their baked Brie and prime rib sliders are amazing! Had a filet mignon salad which was also amazing. Happy hour deals are decent and they have a great variety of beer, wine and cocktails. Servers have been great every time too."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently visited the Village Tavern for drinks and small plates. We loved sitting on outside patio enjoying the beautiful weather. We shared an order of spring rolls and Cuban sliders. They were both delicious and we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Donald S. just reminded me I had not reviewed the Village Tavern yet.  Eat at your own risk, I can only tell you my experience and you do with it what you like.   I la la la loved the food here, used to dine in regularly and happy hour often until.   Dun dun dun dun, one evening my girlfriends and I rendezvous at the Tavern for a little happy hour. It was not happy and we left in well under an hour. Just after being sat in the bar area we saw the biggest freakin rat. It would have made NY proud!   We packed it in and disappeared into the night never to return. :( Sad tale for a place I loved so much. It's like breaking up with someone you still have feelings for but you know it's the right thing to do."}
{"text":"Village Tavern isn't terrible, but it was oh-so-forgetable!   The first time I went here I got the French Onion soup and although it was more cheese than I'd normally like, it was pretty good. The main dish I got, the Shrimp Risotto, was far from impressive. I've had better in a frozen microwave meal.   The second time I went, which was last weekend, I got the Marinated Flank Steak with a side of potatoes Au gratin. The steak was cut very thick for flank steak and was pretty chewy. The potatoes in the Au gratin weren't cooked all the way through and were just lacking any flavor. The vegetables on the side aren't worth mentioning.   The service both times I went was fine. Nothing too exciting, nothing to entice me to come back. As for the restaurant itself,  it's a nice looking place, but the food just doesn't live up to it. Maybe myself and those I've gone with have been ordering the wrong menu items, but I continue to not be wowed."}
{"text":"Seems to be more of a bar crowd. one hour wait for salad and Salmon. Salmon was very dry, over cooked and was loaded with butter. Not prepared with good health in mind! Salad was small for the price and again, loaded with salad dressing! might be a great place for a drink or burger. Probably wont be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The desserts are a must ! I wish I would have started out our meal with dessert 1st  We split the double decker cheesecake , and the warm butter cake 6 ways and let me tell you there is no way anyone could eat anymore than that. Both deserts were so rich and buttery I could could Have passed away into a food coma . I did have the Brie & bacon omelet with potatoes , fruit and a banana nut muffin . All of which were so good !! However , next time I come it will be strictly for another round of dessert paradise"}
{"text":"Sitting on the huge patio with a glass of wine and live music on a nice night is what makes this place for me. The food is above average but not the most unique menu around. Also, don't be fooled by the humble entrance....I almost didn't go in my first time there. give this place a chance and you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. I have tried quite a few items but always come back to the Fish and Chips. They do not over batter the fish and it is never greasy. By far the best Fish and Chips I have ever had. Staff is always friendly and attentive. They keep the place very clean. I would recommend Village Tavern to anyone."}
{"text":"My steak was great.   My service was beyond fabulous.  Thank you Molly    Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"One star only because of the ' red headed and young hostess '. She is rude , unfriendly , and shouldn't be working as the first person a customer sees and deals with.  All the other people have been pretty good"}
{"text":"What a great place for s number of ressons.   First ...libations ...great variety of wine at a very reasonable price  Second ...service ...very capable guy who knew the menu and always smiling.   Third ...atmosphere ...comfortable and cozy... Even though packed...many seating options (bar area, outside , inside)   Fourth...and most importantly ... Food. I had the trout in a lemon butter sauce with capers and my mom had the Colorado Chicken. Both dishes were well prepared, perfectly dressed and hardy portion for a reasonable price.   So for good food and a little relaxation ... Hit the Tavern!"}
{"text":"Most excellent breakfast/brunch spot. The quiche was near perfect for me because they use a milder cheese. The apple walnut muffins are superb!"}
{"text":"Visited here for lunch the other day. Was surprised at how big the place is on the inside.   The food was pretty good as was the service.  I had the soup of the day which was Potato Leek soup which was excellent.  Also had the grilled meatloaf for lunch was  also great.  Prices here also seemed pretty reasonable for as nice of a restaurant it is.  I will be back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Ok, in a restaurant things are going to happen, its how you take care of it that matters most.  The manager on this day handled my cold food issue with professionalism and courtesy. The tavern is a very nice place, more of a lodge feel instead of a the tavern I was visualizing.  Prices were a tad high but its in Scottsdale and one expects to pay more.  Food was not that great just ordered appetizers and like I mentioned earlier were cold and tasteless.  The clam chowder was great.  I should have gotten the Brunch that day which looked yummy on the table next to us.  I will not be back I'm afraid, TOO many restaurants to choose from to give another shot."}
{"text":"Take a pass on the Marinated Flank Steak if it catches your eye, and go with something you know know you like, or that they can't screw up.  The slices were very thick, and my jaw still hurts from chewing.  I tried each of the 4 slices they dealt me, and couldn't get through a one.  Worse yet, the waiter didn't say a thing about it, which at that price, should've been a red flag for him.  I devoured the black beans and fries that were served alongside because I arrived hungry, built up by its rave reviews.  Everyone else in my party seemed satisfied, although my wife hardly touched her rice.  My parents like the place, and I would probably try it again, but I'll stay away from trying to treat myself to anything I think should be worth what they're charging, and have something that won't leave me disappointed.  Fine decor, fine folks, but not the fine dining they lead you to believe.  Typical Phoenix Phony."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a nice, relaxing atmosphere. However, it's kind of hard to find using the GPS because it's connected to a corporate area. Nevertheless, I came here for the first time for a team work dinner. The dip duo was ordered as an appetizer (for 4) and the serving size was really small. The tortilla chips tasted as if it was cooked in old oil so we ordered a new batch.  The dip was not work almost $14. We all ordered steaks (i ordered the ribeye). The steak was good - nothing amazing. I will say that the sweet potato fries were phenomenal. Service was good as well. Still recommend this place."}
{"text":"Family went there to celebrate parents' anniversary.  Food was great and they have a top shelf happy hour which is awesome. Be sure to get there early for happy hour or you won't be able to find a seat."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in over two years! (We lived out of state!) Now we're back living here FULL-TIME and thought we'd come back since our last visit was so great! They did not disappoint!! Came in and were greeted by a very friendly hostess! Sat in the same booth we were in last time, good sign!!   Our server, Lisa couldn't have been nicer!! We like to share. We ordered the fish tacos and a spinach/chicken salad with a yummy poppy seed dressing! They served it exactly as we like it split for us already! Food was delicious!   We are going to make this one of our go to places, especially when we have out-of-town company!! Great place to celebrate Sweetest Day!"}
{"text":"The food is generally very good at this Village Tavern. However there could be an improvement on their brunch items. I had the Eggs Benedict. It had one very, very small and thin slice of Canadian bacon on each English muffin. The eggs were under cooked and the hollandaise  was very bland. The potatoes were too crispy and the portion has been reduced from previous times we have eaten here. Overall we did not feel we received our value today."}
{"text":"Joined some family members for dinner there last night. The experience started off with a very poor server. Without offering drinks he went straight to wanting to take a food order. We corrected him and it continued downhill when I asked for a Newcastle and after 15 minutes asked where it was and he said they were out. He recommended something else which I tried and it was a poor suggestion. The bar manager stopped by and said yes we have Newcastle and brought me one. The problem took so long to solve the table ordered their second round and I hadn't received my first.  I ordered the sea bass skip it. It came out as a portion controlled slice. Never seen it served that way before. Couple very poor service and portion control food led to a poor experience."}
{"text":"I left the village tavern last night feeling like I had been cheated out of a decent dinner. I have dined there in the past several times and always had a positive experience. Sadly last night was not at all how I had remembered it.  Service was great, as we waited we were offered a beverage and our waitress was good and a kind gentleman who was leaving the bar area was kind enough to give us his table. But that unfortunately can't make up for the terribly over cooked food we received which frankly should have never been allowed to leave the kitchen like that.   I ordered their salmon entree which was served with coscous which was mushed together so much it resembled the pan it had been it and it was cold when served. The salmon was so over cooked that it was beyond dry and was almost more like eating chicken than a delicious filet of salmon. My boyfriend ordered the chicken Marsala and his was like sandpaper. He did enjoy the spinach salad and the other plus was wine was half off on Wednesdays!  I was just really disappointed in the quality of the food I received."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great!  Incredible happy hour and the food for casual dining is well prepared and an excellent value. The staff goes out of their way to help customers and are very knowledgeable about the menu.. A once a week restaurant for us. And we always end up meeting nice people at the bar."}
{"text":"VT has several locations, I used to frequent one in Winston-Salem, NC. They have a good menu but the Charlotte restaurant is poorly designed making seating problematic. They have booths on the perimeter of the space along the windows, and a sizable bar area on the other side of the restaurant. In the middle section there are about six four tops tables situated very close to one another and very close to the bar. The bar has long high top tables and IMHO is too large. They could remove some of the bar space since they aren't really a sports bar and extend the regular dining area.  I will also point out that the restaurant is located in area with hotels and office buildings and has a small parking lot. There is no street parking. You sometimes have to wait for a diner to exit the lot to get a spot.  The first time we went to this location, we were seated at one of the four tops and we were right on top of a group for whom they have moved tables together. We were able to move to an available booth. The last time we were seated in the same are and a group with several kids were seated a  long high top table very close to us. As is often the case, the parents were not attending them and the kids were running everywhere- as a side note this is NOT a  good restaurant for small children; they do not appear to have areas to accommodate families. We asked to be moved to a booth or another four top away from the kids and were told those were reserved for reservations who had not shown up yet. The fact that we also had a reservation didn't seem to matter. After our server spoke to the manager, the best he could do was put at a high top in what looked like a hallway off from the bar which would have been like not being in the restaurant at all. We decided to leave and went to another restaurant.   We will not return. It's too much hassle to dine here and there are numerous other restaurants in Charlotte that have  comparable menus and offer a better dining experience."}
{"text":"We love this place--which truly has that Tavern feel, as you'll see--and usually eat here before going to the move theater at the mall nearby. It kinda has a weird location--you can't really walk to it from anywhere or anything, but it has a huge parking lot so it's easy to get to via car.   And get there you should. There's a great bar there if you're up for a drink and a huge outdoor area if the weather's nice; you can have drinks back there as well food. One time we were this summer a guy was performing while we dined, which was nice.   The menu is pretty extensive and American-y, as you'd expect at a big ol' tavern that pumps the food out, but it's surprisingly good (though not the healthiest place now that I think about it) and high-quality.   I love their salads--all of them (and they have a lot). Try the Greek with the grilled salmon if you want a proven (and healthier) option. Pair with some wine, and you're all set for a great meal. And that's worth mentioning: tons of wine options, all very good."}
{"text":"Oh my, this place is yummy.   If you're into squid you must try the calamari. Possibly the best calamari I've ever eaten. Nice little hint of spice. The bread basket with muffins are really good too.  I was surrounded by the meatloaf and mashed potatoes which smelled so good and tasted even better.  My lunch was good but I have to admit that three days later I don't remember what I ordered. You can tell I like the meatloaf lol.   I did try the cream brûlée for dessert and it was great but the apple cobbler was phenomenal. Once again not my food.   I'd recommend trying this place and on Wednesday they have half price wine. I hear you need a reservation for that night."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for dinner and I knew she was curious about this place since we always wonder what the food was like.  The server was okay.  We started off with the crab cake appetizer which was okay. The crab cake was not as firm as I would have liked, but it was good enough to enjoy. It was placed on top of a garden green salad.  My wife ordered the medium rare Filet Mignon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fCJrZIzz85_8Uhf072QVnA?select=R1hK7SL71GbWVDCju15H2A and I had the medium rare prime rib. We both had the wedge salad which was the perfect size, not to large.     Asked her how she liked it, said it was burnt on the outside and a tad bit over cooked. As you can see, my was cooked perfectly.  We topped the meal off with a Banana Crepes. It was more like ice cream crepes because the two crepes were wrapped around vanilla ice cream. The bananas were on the bottom split in half and made into a tic tac toe design, topped with the ice cream crepes then a scope of vanilla ice cream was place on top. It was drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauces. I should have taken a picture of it, but I was so amazed at the dessert that I grabbed my spoon and started digging in.  The place was a bit loud and the table and booth arrangment reminded us of Houston's Restaurant."}
{"text":"FOOD: The best prime rib I've ever had. I always enjoy the wine, too. Appetizers are pretty good, especially calamari. Can't say much more about the food because I only get the prime rib whenever I go. \"Stick to what you know,\" the saying goes. Try it!  PRICE: For the prime rib meal, an appetizer, and a drink it'll be over $30 for sure.   ATMOSPHERE: For a dirty, uncultured college student like me, this place is more upscale than the vast majority of places I eat. It's a nice restaurant with nice seating. Don't go in with flip flops, Scottsdale brosefs.   SERVICE: For the most part, good servers and very helpful.   SKINNY: I always go here with family and I always get the prime rib and I'm always happy as can be and I'm stopping this run-on sentence."}
{"text":"this place is good. kinda like your Houlihan's type restaurant. you know, like that restaurant in Office Space, but without the wait staff flair'd up.  I had a blackened tuna sandwich which was pretty good with sweet potato fries. the sweet potato fries taste like they're lightly dusted with a cinnamon sugar maybe, can't be mad at that. it kind of enabled me to skip dessert. my doctor thanks you. sort of."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but service is super slow. Maybe they were short staffed?? I got the Chicken Marsalla, chocolate torte for dessert, and a blueberry mojito.. Drinks took about 20 minutes to come out. Also when I ordered a decaf coffee to go with my torte, it came out cold.. Overall not impressed, unless they can speed up service, then this place could be awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am definitely a repeat customer. I usually go with the family. It has a quiet environment, great servers, and amazing steaks. Definitely ask for the bread and butter too. This is a great place to celebrate birthdays!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised! I thought it would be bar food and instead it was a full menu with many healthy choices, including gluten free entrees. Our meal started out with complimentary bread (upon request). I had the mango iced tea to drink.  I chose the Pulled Pork Street Tacos-they were on soft flour corn tortillas seasoned with Mexican spices, shredded lettuce, and pico de Gallo.They came with black beans and rice.It was so fresh and delicious. My friends had the southern shrimp and grits-it had applewood smoked bacon, mushrooms, green onions, garlic, anson mills organic stone ground grits with gruyere cheese. They loved it!   All of their entrees looked really good-burgers, sandwiches, fish, vegetarian choices too.  We sat in the bar but didn't have much time as we had to get to the airport but it looked like a really fun place. Their desserts sounded delicious too! The service was great, I want to go back next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent is the best way to describe the Village Tavern. I have frequent business lunches there and the salmon has always been fairly good, not exceptional. But I was told that the burgers were great so I tried one a few months ago. It was indeed great. And the fries were scolding hot (I like them that way!), crisp  and a great portion. Absolutely delicious.  I had a day to myself last week so took myself to lunch and decided to go for an awesome burger. WOW. I thought I was in a different restaurant. I asked for my burger without mayo. It came with mayo and to my horror, the waitress took the top bun off my plate with her hands and then came back with a new top.  There were about 10 fries, wilted and lukewarm. I guess at 1:00pm I got the leftovers from the crowd.  The burger was simply not good and the server was worse. I don't enjoy being made to feel like an intrusion on one's time.   I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The Clam Chowder is delicious. It was the first time that I've had that type of soup with a bit of a kick."}
{"text":"I was looking for something in the area that wasn't too pricey, yet not too cheap either in hopes to receive a nice meal. Hit the jackpot! This place was great! The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. There was almost an hour wait so we decided to sit outside to have dinner. They had the heat lamps on so it made it very comfortable to sit outside. Our waitress was great and the food was even better.  Scallops wrapped on bacon...to die for.....hot crab dip...good, but was a little runny..Ive had better, but still very good. The salmon burger was very yummy. I do not usually like salmon burgers but this was one probably one of the best I've had. The wine selection seemed great too. I got the fat cat pino noir...nice and smooth!  Overall I am very happy to have found this place while on vacation. One day if I come back to the area I will have to eat here again."}
{"text":"I love the Village Tavern & over time it has become my go to place. Between my sister & me, we have probably eaten there some 200+ times, especially if you include take out. The service varies from good to excellent, but where they really shine is in their willingness to accommodate requests. They have managed every request we have ever thrown at them, & some of the people we have taken are really difficult (allergies, intolerances, etc.) Another thing I really like about the Village Tavern is the menu variety. I can get a burger & fries, or a Mexican salad (excellent, BTW), or Thai nachos (also excellent, but only order if you have a friend to share), or shrimp scampi. For someone who eats there all the time, variety is important.   The only thing I don't like about the Village Tavern is that in the Winter/Spring it seems to be full of snowbirds & it can be hard to get a table. (& they seem to crowd the lobby area with the intent of making sure that no one can get through.) So I make a reservation or get take out, no big deal, but something to note."}
{"text":"Wine down Wednesday!!! Great specials and apps. The crowd was a bit of a surprise but all in all a great visit."}
{"text":"I ordered ribeye steak. It was a little bland just like the mashed potatoes I ordered as one of my sides. The spinach was good. My kids seemed to have enjoyed what they ordered. The service was very good. Next time I might order something else."}
{"text":"Me, my husband, my mother and my step father ate here on a Sunday around lunch time. We called to make a reservation and the hostess said we could not because it was 30 minutes before the reservation. She said they needed 2 hours notice. A little ridiculous. We showed up and didn't have to wait though so that was fortunate because my husband and I had a flight to catch. Service was good. My husband and I are gluten free. We asked for the gluten free menu. There were quite a few options, which was nice. My burger came out cooked perfectly medium, which is difficult for some restaurants to do. The food was ok. I wasn't impress but I wasn't underwhelmed. On the regular menu there were many option and they looked adn sounded excellent. I would go back again, I know this is one of my mom and step dads go to places. I am not dying to go back though."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and have found it inconsistent; e.g., trout thick and juicy top thin and almost burnt.  Last time, I ordered something different - the teriyaki chicken.  It was terrible!  Tough old bird that I could hardly cut, surrounded by a (nice!) pile of veggies absolutely inedible because of swimming in a pool of teriyaki sauce (and husband's trout was really thin and burnt). It will be a long time before we try it again. (and waiter could not tell me where their salmon was sourced (i.e., Pacific or Atlantic) -- said it was \"farmed\".  Really?? I doubt it.)  He really did not know anything about the food."}
{"text":"My father adores their meatloaf. However, having just seen \"Forks Over Knives,\" he has been trying to adhere to a more plant-based diet. So he wolfed down the spaghetti squash with equal, if somewhat wistful, aplomb.  I got the new Thai chicken salad, without chicken (good little vegan I am now). Wow. It was stellar, even without its central ingredient. And huge - it's enough for two meals!  Definitely coming back for this again. Like tomorrow."}
{"text":"Not really sure why some people like this place so much.   First off, where the heckers is this place located? It's like in some weird building...is it in a hotel? Business center? Mafia front? Who really knows?  We sat outside, and we were the only people there who were under 50 years old for quite a long time.   The pimento cheese dip was average. Pretty greasy. Cocktails weren't great. My chicken salad sandwich was unimpressive. I mean, it's just chicken salad, but I could taste the mediocrity.  Our server had all of the social charm of an ex-con. He was brusque and inattentive. Never refilled our waters, so we were pretty thirsty from the humidity.   I mean, it's going to taste better than fast food, but I'm not clamoring to return. It's definitely not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Ordered out from here twice when I stayed at the Gainey Ranch Suites next door. Great calamari appetizer! The thai chili sauce ti dip with is amazing!"}
{"text":"Holy cow. I thought I had seen it all, but this restaurant managed to put it \"all\" in one awful basket. First, they served me a $15/glass Quilt Cab in a run-of-the-mill wine glass. Ok. Picky? Maybe, but \"they did not have a bigger glass. Then the waitress then asked me how I wanted my Ahi Tuna starter \"cooked\", I should have known. When I nearly hit my head on the plastic take out box left on the banquette behind me, I should have known. When I heard the waitress, who had just pitched the \"5$ Friday night margaritas, mojitos and Moscow mules\", explain that \"mojitos are the ones with mint\", I should have known. When they filled a to go box at another table, at the table, I should have known...But, I stayed anyway, and ate a mediocre, Chili's would have been better and less expensive, dinner. Shame on me."}
{"text":"We really like the Village Tavern in Greensboro, NC, so we decided to try the one in Scottsdale when we were surprised to see one there. Like the one in Greensboro, it was terrific. Good service and food and handsome dining area. My wife had the the Grouper Hemingway--the Greensboro location does it with snapper--and I had the spinach salad with grilled salmon. Both were superb! Beyond that, service was excellent for both drinks and entrees, and the dining area was very pleasant, well maintained, and clean. We were very pleased."}
{"text":"This is my go to place in Scottsdale. The food is consistently delicious here. I have ordered a wedge salad with grilled salmon more times then I can remember and I've enjoyed it every time. The shrimp and grits is also a favorite dish and very flavorful. Try their key lime pie for dessert, it's fabulous!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times. Great for large parties or just you and your spouse. The food is great and so are the drinks. Love the margarita with house-made mix. Also tried the butter cake and the carrot cake. Both were huge shareable portions but very good. Walking distance from the Renaissance Hotel which is why we love to stay there."}
{"text":"THE HOURS ON THIS YELP PAGE ARE WRONG! DO NOT SHOW UP AFTER 10 PM AND EXPECT TO ORDER OFF THEIR MENU!  THEIR KITCHEN CLOSES AT 10 PM AND ONLY THEIR BAR IS OPEN UNTIL MIDNIGHT WITH A LIMITED BAR FOOD MENU STARTING AT 10P! We arrived at 9:50 on a Wednesday night and the hostess said the kitchen was closed and only bar menu was available, and since it was late, we stayed anyway.  Food was good and cocktail sauce served with shrimp cocktail was excellent with lots of kick.  Waiter was very friendly and helpful & I nearly gave 4 stars as the service was excellent.  But - this is NOT a late night restaurant."}
{"text":"Arrived for Sunday brunch about 11:15.  Thirty minute wait for a private table.  Open seating at bar and high tops. Chose the latter.  Fast attention from staff.  Excellent menu selection.  Reasonable pricing.  Reservation suggested, but not mandatory."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years,  always 5 stars. Today was different. French toast was mush sent back and again came back mushy. So the manager said what else can we make you. They made waffle. It had LIQUID center. The manager apologized but never offered to get me any cooked food. So I left the restaurant hungry. I wasn't looking for anything for free but for the manager to send away a customer hungry and not offer to fix his kitchen quality control issue with a cooked dish that I wanted to pay for is unacceptable. Manager Jay didn't seem to care!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with good food and a nice variety. The ambiance is great, with a very nice patio too. The menu has a range of very decent priced items like burgers and sandwiches to more expensive items as well. This is a great spot and I'm glad I gave it a try."}
{"text":"Village Tavern is a great restaurant, good good, good prices and good service.  A fun place to go and enjoy a meal.  The selection is large and I especially enjoy their steaks and prime rib.  The food is prepared just as ordered,.  I make a point of going when I am down in the Scottsdale aresa."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Food and service were both great. We ordered flatbreads for appetizers and they were delicious! I ordered the chicken teriyaki entree and it was great. Vegetables were perfectly cooked and the amount of teriyaki sauce was just right. Chicken was juicy and tender."}
{"text":"This is my all around favorite restaurant.   Always good solid food, and a nice bar when wanted."}
{"text":"We visited recently and have just given up.  We've been 3 times and it never gets better.  I would have assumed a Thursday evening would have had a great environment but we were a group of 6 and there couldn't have been more than 20 others.  Bar menu was good, appetizers we only okay.  We specifically asked if the turkey burgers were fresh ground and fresh patties or frozen.  We were assured they were great fresh burgers but it came out in a flat circle, not a juicy fresh patty.  I ordered a 'very rare' 16oz Prime Rib and it came out most certainly medium well, very grey and no juices.  Quite a disappointment from what I had seen photographed.  It was an hour from closing so I didn't send it back.  To have purchased the Prime Rib, and app for the table, a bottle of wine, and a Turkey Burger, the total with 20% was $130.  I could certainly find better places in SouthPark and the Midtown for that price."}
{"text":"I would give the Village Tavern 10 stars if I could. This is just one of those places that gets everything right. The food is outstanding and there is a lot of variety to choose from on the menu. You can literally get anything from appetizers to filet mignon. The decor is nice and comfortable and it was a fun and lively place to hang out. The service was excellent. Very friendly staff that we found ourselves chatting with often. Management comes by the table and asks if all is good. Prices are really affordable, especially for such great food. Wednesday was 1/2 price wine day and we were drinking really good glasses of wine for $4-5 each. The homemade flatbread pizza was amazing. It was more like a small east coast Sicilian pie. The pulled pork sliders were among the best I've had. Their burger was excellent. And the seared Ahi tuna appetizer was off the charts and almost enough to eat for lunch on its own. Just can't say enough good things about Village Tavern. I wish they had one near my home town. But for sure, I'll be back next time I'm in Scottsdale or should I visit one of their other locations."}
{"text":"The bun was amazing and the burgers were very juicy & fantastic. Great French fries, crisp and delicious. The staff are always super friendly and welcoming. Good prices too! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Came to celebrate my teen son's great report card. He's a straight  up carnivore so liked some of frheir steak options. Ultimately everything was meh, profoundly unremarkable. I think there are much better options around here in the same price range."}
{"text":"This is where I wish we had .5 stars because I really thought this place was not quite a 4 but more than a 3. We were here for a Thursday night for a birthday dinner. We had a large party with one waiter and he handled the group well. So the service is good. The menu is pretty big with many selections at different price ranges. I wouldn't say the menu had anything particular that stood out. I ordered the blackened salmon sandwich with sweet potato fries. I liked how they gave you an option of what side you wanted and the sweet potato fries were not extra. The sweet potato fries were very good actually and seasoned with cinnamon sugar. I also ordered an appetizer salad and it was a general salad. The salmon was decent and fresh. In addition to dinner I got the organic Malbec wine and it was very smooth and a good price. I thought this was different because usually restaurants have more than one Malbec but this one had several to choose from so I appreciated that. This isn't a place I would go out of my way to go to but it is a good option if you are hungry and in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh & delicious food! Exceptional quality of food! Service was terrific as well. One & only drawback is dated decor/atmosphere, otherwise a great place to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Not always on the ball though and the bar has WAY too many chairs crammed up to it."}
{"text":"The food is excellent but the service from waiters and management is lacking.   Last night, my father and I dinned at th Scottsdale location. While dinning we noticed that on the table was a promotion for signing up with the Village Taverns email list. On the sign it says sign up and receive 25% off. Before dinner was over I quickly signed up to join and showed the wait staff that I joined. The server told me sorry that 25% off would be for your next visit and he would be glad to have the manager come speak to me regarding the restrictions. The manger on duty last night came over and asked if I had any question. I stated that according to the promotional flyer on the table it says \"Connect with Us! Get 25% off. Just for joining!\" No where on the flyer is a restriction regarding when you can take advantage of this 25% off. He argued that if he was to give the 25% off tonight, that I would still be receiving the 25% off coupon that could be used at a later date and how was that fair. A patron of an establishment should not have to argue about restrictions that are not published anywhere not even on the website. In addition, a patron should not be belittled and be give a guilt trip from manager on duty when questioning the lack of publish restrictions of a promotional off.   Finally the manager agreed to honor the 25% off but only applied it to one item instead of the whole bill like the promotion leads one to believe. It's almost like they are using a bait and switch to increase their email following."}
{"text":"There for a get together in the bar on Friday.  Was a little late, so could no longer have the private room even though we called.  Orderd the shrimp scampi for myself they should have described it as a plate of not tasty pasta with a few shrimp.  Complained to the manager and all he could say was well let me take it away for you.  Did not offer to take it off the bill.  Other party had fish and chips and told me it was just so/so.  This was not the first time that I had been there for an office event and but for sure it is the last time.  Would go somewhere else where the services is better and the food at least has some taste."}
{"text":"Great burger. Such a wide variety of items on the menu. Service was great. Super easy lunch time spot. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Village Tavern has been our \"go to\" place for years.  We have always enjoyed taking friends there and celebrating special events.  Following that tradition, we recently planned a dinner to celebrate a birthday.  As normal for high season, the place was packed with people waiting for tables.  We had reservations and were seated promptly.  That was a highlight of the evening.  Upon being seated, we immediately noticed a big change in the lighting with brightly shining spotlights over most of the tables with large chandeliers in several places in the dining room.  In the past, it has always been somewhat dim with small lights over the tables, giving a nice intimate atmosphere.  Now it's feeling like a big cafeteria.  I asked our server about the change and he said they had recently remodeled, including the lighting.  Strike one.  Timing of service was off as well.  While we're just 2 bites into our salad, a server appears with our entrees, ready to dump and run, seemingly surprised that we weren't willing to be rushed into accepting the plates.  We sent her and the entrees away.  Eventually we finished salads and the entrees reappeared, fresh from the warmer.  The entrees were generally good as we've come to know but the veggies did not fare well due to the wait.  Strike two.  I'm hoping the management will remedy the new improved lighting.  While seemingly trivial, it's amazing what a difference it makes in the overall ambiance.  The service issue can be passed off as a minor glitch although if it had been my first visit, it might well have been my last.  Please Village Tavern, please don't make a Strike three."}
{"text":"Great bar food ; cheap price. Try chilled sampler; salmon; 3 big shrimp, big slice of Brie, grapes and toast points. Restaurant side good too Happy hour has good beer and well drink prices"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. For coming from out of town and looking for good tasting food, this fit the bill just fine."}
{"text":"Too expensive for what I ordered. Bacon wrapped scallops. I could not even eat them with the steak knife on the skewer. Tough. French Onion soup was good. One glass of wine. Bill over $30!!!  Not worth it.   Also false advertising. The scallop appetizer on yelp shows more than three which is what I was served. Not happy."}
{"text":"I would describe my girlfriend and my visit to Village Tavern as the quintessential 4 star experience in my opinion - everything was good, but nothing really blew us away.  I ordered the pimento bacon cheeseburger and she got the crispy chicken tacos. Her crispy chicken tacos were probably the best part of both meals; the crispy, spicy chicken went perfectly with the sweetness of the slaw. The sides of rice and black beans were just average, however. My pimento bacon cheeseburger was good, but the bacon was overwhelming. It had 4 huge strips of bacon, which normally I wouldn't mind but the bacon was simply too sweet. I know that sounds odd, but it was almost candied bacon with strong maple/sugar taste. My comment after my first bite was \"wow that was really... sweet\", which is almost never something you say eating a burger. I took 2 of the 4 strips off and finished the burger, and it was better. The burger was cooked medium as I asked, but it lacked a great char or any meaty flavor that you look for. The caramelized onions were excellent but the pimento cheese was average. It was a decent burger overall, and I enjoyed the sweet potato fries on the side too.  Our server was pretty friendly but somehow just seemed a bit odd in his actions. Also I got mayo on my burger after asking for them to leave it off, but that was no big deal to me since it took 5 seconds to scrape most of it off. We were also pretty set on trying the brownie dessert after an initial glance at the menu, but he actually talked us out of it when he described all the desserts and said the brownie and another choice weren't very good. The food was solid, but nothing really wowed us and made us strongly want to come back. I'd say Village Tavern is a good, safe option for quality food but nothing that you must try."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant several times when visiting Scottsdale, predominantly due to its proximity to the hotel I stay at.  First and foremost -- the wait-staff and bartenders are some of the friendliest and attentive I've seen.  They take no blame here.  Probably the best fare here is the burgers -- they are hard to mess up, and you can always add more condiments.  This week I was there twice -- first with a group where we had appetizers and dinner.  I had some form of a spring-roll, a Caesar salad, and a salmon entree the first night, and another Caesar and a sandwich made from short-ribs.  I realized that it is highly probable that the kitchen must consist of a row of deep-fat fryers and microwaves since most of the fare is either fried or re-heated.  Having eaten the fare here, and noted others' plates, it seems that they must be purchasing pre-cooked items from Costco or an equivalent warehouse store and just reheating.  Certainly the appetizers are frozen-fare -- that seemed obvious (and not unusual for this type of venue.  But clearly the perfectly rectangular pieces of fish soaked in tangy sauce is also from the deep-freeze, as is the meat which purpotedly is a short-rib (it appeared more like my great-grandmothers pot-roast, except for the gooey, somewhat coagulated, fat).  Now, I actually kind of like that kind of food -- but not so much when the frozen salmon filet, easily purchased at about $3/filet, was served for nearly $24, and a sandwich made of short-ribs contained more bread, filler, and grease than meat (again, with a deference to frozen concoction) for $12.95 -- and the \"caesar\" salad for $6.95 which was just a regular old chopped iceberg lettuce salad with a squirt of cheap pseudo-caesar dressing, no croutons, no cheese, no bread, no nothin'  The problem here is value -- it's just far to highly priced for the quality of the product which is served.  On a side note -- they apparently have live entertainment on certain nights -- from what I experienced, I would suggest a better vetting process -- old-guy with guitar who fries the PA system first, then has no volume at all later, doesn't help.  Amateur night is best left for other venues which cater to cheap karaoke."}
{"text":"We came here as a family for Sunday afternoon meal.  I do not understand why some of the wait staff do not know the food they are serving.  The steak I ordered was suppose to come with two sides, I ordered my filet medium and received the meal with just a well done steak and no sides on the plate.  It took them more than three times to get the order correct.  It might have been the day or the business of the restaurant as they were swamped.  I might try again on a weekday. After receiving my meal, the food was okay, not amazing and nothing to write home about just okay.  But I liked the lay out of the restaurant and the decorations."}
{"text":"Highly recommend for lunch. Sit on the patio if weather permits. Lots of selections on the menu Wonderful crab cake,real lump crabmeat. Tuna melt was hot and fresh served on good rye bread. Server was prompt and helpful I will definitely go again"}
{"text":"Service was poor. When I arrived the hostess looked at me like a had 2 horns sticking out of my head. Waiter was missing for 20 minutes. Food was great"}
{"text":"Every time I visit Village Tavern I expect more than I receive, but I'm always hopeful! The food is good, the atmosphere was a little lacking but over all it's a nice quiet place for a date. Village Tavern's reputation far exceeds the real life experience. Even with the lacking service I would return for a quiet date, with little distractions and pretty good food."}
{"text":"Another of my favorites in Charlotte!!! Great food and ambience. Their bartender is super in mixing and you'll want more than seconds cocktail drinks. Surprisingly for the quality, great food, higher end service and decor this place is very well priced. As a vegan/vegetarian and sometimes even pescatarian (I always choose balance over perfección), they are friendly, helpful and always accommodate to all my dietary restrictions and choices (which of course if you follow my reviews aside from great food you'll notice, flexibility and service are rank within highest in my ratings). In addition, they are family friendly, their bar gets super busy for those looking for conversation, and a good time. I highly recommend making reservations ahead of time as it kind get busy. You must order the grits and shrimp or scallops dish (it can be very greasy but they will accommodate to no bacon which makes it super greasy). Their Moscow mules drink is amazing I think because of the ginger beer they may use. If you live in Charlotte or you're just passing by, this is a stop you must plan to make. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour! They have indoor and outdoor seating. We arrived at 4:10 and the patio was full. We sat at a pub table right next to the patio so it was just like being outside. Not sure when you have to get there to get a table outside. HH is from 4-6:30 M-Fri.  The bar menu has some great deals on it. You can order off that menu all day, it's just not at HH.  We had the Chilled sampler which had a nice piece of smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail (4 nice size shrimp), Brie, some fruit and garlic toast points. The sauce for the salmon was delicious. And for $7.95 it's a great deal. We also had the prime rib sliders and the the shrimp tacos. I just loved the shrimp tacos, they had a mango slaw which was really tasty. Drinks were the best deal of all. $5 Grey goose, Johnnie Walker Black,  Tangueray, Jack Daniels, Patron??? And they were really nice pours. Martini straight up they give you the shaker. It's no wonder they pack them in here.  Service was outstanding too. We had a great waitress. Kept our drinks full and our tummy. :)"}
{"text":"Food was pretty terrible and overpriced. We had Cobb salad and BLT both were not worth $12-15 price range. The service was pretty OK but my wine glass was very visibly spotty and the water glass had remnants from the dishwasher."}
{"text":"good place to meet friends for dinner. many choices from salad to seafood to burgers to steak.  service was good and we could all talk with each other."}
{"text":"Along with freinds we were visiting Scottsdale for an overnite getaway from Tucson. When we checked into our accomidations the innkeeper recomended the Village Tavern. The four of us are always looking for the next great eatery, and this time we found it!  We had the choice of the bar or the dinning room. It was Happy Hour and they offered 1/2 priced drinks in the bar only. We chose a booth in the dinning room. The ambiance was warm and enviting and made you feel at home.  Our server (Colby) was very knowlageable on the food items but not as much on the adult beverages. We jokingly told him he should try each one on a day off or after work and he thought that was a great idea. Colby told us that this is a scratch kitchen so feel free to order what you wanted for sides regardless of what the menue satted.  None of us were unsatisfied with our meals or the expeiance, we all came away feeling like we had just found our new goto reasturant in the greater Pheoinx area. We will be planning future get aways around their hours."}
{"text":"My post is mostly about the staff attire. My adult beverages were tasty, my Flatbread pizza was yummy and the outdoor patio was awesome. Our server was great and intelligent.  Here's my gripe and it doesn't apply just to this business.  I'm not old or crotchety, not even 40 yet but I absolutely hate seeing restaurant staff in black yoga or spandex pants. There's no class in yoga, pants and slacks is more appropriate.  Please no more yoga pants."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Rueben I've had anywhere - and I eat the Rueben almost every time it's on anyone's menu.  Nice array of draught beers.  The place is also very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised!! Started with calamari and margaritas both were really good. I ordered the Dubliner burger for dinner and my husband got the turkey burger. Both were great! They have a GREAT wines by the glass list!"}
{"text":"Came for Happy Hour while having a staycation and stayed past happy hour. Very good service (thank you to the very awesome Dillon) honest menu, great drinks. I would come back again. The French Onion soup is legit."}
{"text":"Village Tavern brings back so many memories to me.  As a Charlotte native, my high school friends and I would dine here before cotillion dances and always felt like super cool adults.  The restaurant has not changed much (it still offers outdoor seating which is stellar in warmer months, or under the tent with heaters in cold months).    To be honest, VT is the type of restaurant I want to give three stars tops, but I just can't.  I am a big ambiance person, and it is just very chainy looking on the inside.  All that aside, the food, in my opinion, has gotten better over the last couple of years.  I have found myself requesting to go here over some of the newer trendier restaurants.  The new bacon wrapped scallop appetizer was outstanding, as well as the crab dip (hard to mess up in my book).  I have to agree with Giannabrie, the zucchini squash with marinara dish is freaking fantastic. So much flavor. You don't miss the noodles at all. It's a full feeling that you can feel good about!  VT also always has good drink specials.  I am a fan of the half-priced wines by the glass on Wednesdays.    The food is consistent, good prices, and nice portions for your money."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Dan, the bartender, makes the best cocktails. He's enthusiastic and wants you to enjoy his drinks. Appetizers favorites- potato chips w ranch is a huge order, great for sharing. I also like the spring rolls and the crab dip. I'm a creature of habit and always get the flat breads, but the salmon and trout are always good. Finally, I think this place has the BEST desserts in town...the double decker cheesecake is TDF, butter cake w vanilla ice cream and key lime pie are my other favorites. Oh and don't forget the chocolate torte. Never had the carrot cake or apple dessert. Go and enjoy the patio when it's cool out. You won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Great food, if you like French Onion Soup, you must try it here. Beware the dinner salads are big enough to feed two. The service is excellent and the kids menu is large."}
{"text":"Love this place!   I came here with my family and we had a fantastic meal. We had French onion soup, spinach salad, wedge salad, meatloaf, burgers, and the prime rib. The prime rib was the best I have ever had! Every single bite melted in my mouth...absolutely glorious. Jack was our waiter and he couldn't have been more friendly and attentive; we got everything we needed in a timely fashion, and our orders were all correct. The only thing that wasn't top notch were the desserts. We ordered the key lime pie and apple cobbler; the pie was too sweet and more cheesecakey than like key lime pie, and the apple cobbler was not sweet enough. Other than that the food was spectacular.   The atmosphere is so warm and inviting, you don't want to leave. The restaurant in huge and always packed, so that right there tells you how good it is. The prices are reasonable, and at happy hour you can score great deals!   We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Good location for Scottsdale.  Restaurant is very nice on the inside.  The bar was packed (hey . . . it was on a Friday afternoon).  Sat in the dining room.  Dining room was pretty crowded already.  Lots of folks with small children but the children were behaving fine as it was still early in the evening.  Tourists in tee shirts and shorts.  It was Scottsdale after all and I suppose folks were on vacation.  I had the prime rib because of the earlier reviews I'd read here.  Prime rib was very good.  Just came on a plate with a side of mashed potatoes.  Pretty boring but I was hungry.  I loved the wedge salad.  It was full of blu cheese and bacon.  I'd get that again.  Husband had the crab cakes.  He said it was just OK.  All in all, I'd go back.  But I'd sit in the bar and order off the bar food menu.  One thing I didn't like.  Good service but she brought out our meal about 5 minutes after ordering.  I felt like I was at In n Out instead of having a relaxing meal on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I met my mother here for lunch. Inside looks very familiar - typical dark restaurant/bar that reminds you of Houstons or a dozen other places in a 10 mile radius. Given that it's so generic, I'll spare you the review of the ambiance and the service since it's typical and average as well.   My mother raved about the potato chips which were okay... they were basically deep fried potato slices with salt... some were crispy and some were soggy. It looked too greasy for me at that moment in time, so I only had a few. I'm wondering if the excessive grease and apparent overcooking contributed to the gut rot my girlfriend experienced.  We all ordered salads after discussing burgers and other rich foods. I opted for the Chicken Caesar. It was pretty mediocre and I didn't finish it. They brought us bread after we asked and then reminded a few times and it was just as average as everything else about this place.   Nothing sticks out here as being special in any way. The place seems to be aiming for semi-upscale, but is failing or just barely putting in the minimum required effort."}
{"text":"This spot is definitely one of m y favorite places in Charlotte. Food and service is always great. They've definitely stepped up their game since remodeling the inside. Very stylish and up to date."}
{"text":"Came here for a holiday party, and it was A-OK.    SERVICE:  On-point.  From entrance to exit, they did a great job of emphasizing good service.  Was greeted by hostess and GM or assistant GM was nearby and walked me over to the party locale which was set up in a nice area outside the actual restaurant, but well-heated.  Service at the holiday party was great.  Cleared plates for us, took drink orders, and had the right attitude.  Dunno the chick's name, but she did a good job.  Even when I was leaving, the hostess dude caught up to me and asked how I liked the event and bid farewell.  It seems minor, but the restaurant service was hospitable.  FOOD:  Pretty average.  I'm not sure if its our fault (do we select entrees?) or theirs, but the spread was eclectic.  Chicken skewers, boneless chicken wings, egg rolls, veggie mix, meat balls, some broccoli-cheese casserole-looking thing, and flat soda.  Please check your soda before serving it - probably left over from the previous holiday party or something.  Egg rolls were soggy upon service and meatballs were cold.  It was a hellishly random collection of dishes that didn't really go well together.  If it's the holiday planning party committee's fault, then sorry Village Tavern!  I'm not particularly interested in trying the restaurant itself based on the food.    dmo out."}
{"text":"This place is the best of all worlds. Outstanding service, great atmosphere - which is slightly upscale but not pretentious, and a diverse menu which offers the gamut - comfort food to healthy offerings. My husband and I have been 3 times, twice at the bar for drinks and apps, once in the dining room. Ordered different things each time, extremely happy on all visits. Will be our \"go to\" from now on."}
{"text":"Great casual vibe with upscale tavern food and a decent wine list.   Happy hour offers decent prices and food discounts,  but Wednesday is the best as they have all wines by the glass half off.   Live music on Thurs eves is a plus"}
{"text":"We are year round residents and visit Village Tavern on a regular basis. There has never been a time that we were not delighted with not only the quality of the menu items but the service as well. This past Monday we stopped in again and as usual our meal exceeded our expectations. In addition our server was very helpful with describing some of the menu items for our guest who was a first time guest there. She not only knew how each item was prepared bur also knew details of the special ingredients and how carefully they are selected by the management for high quality to ensure a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Love the renovations. Bar is great and all the beer selection is good. My favorite dish is the pork chop. Simply amazing! Dry rubbed steak is tasty too. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Our food was delicious! Huge menu with lots of variety. Service was great - attentive, kind, and timely. Prices were reasonable and half price wine on Wednesdays! I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"In town for business, so I'm a great big party of o-n-e.  After looking at reviews for places within walking distance of my hotel, I decide on Village Tavern (figuring the food looks good and I should be able to get a seat at the bar because according to reviews, this is off the beaten path).  Not only was the place packed - but there was no room at the bar.  After looking around (discouraged) I went outside to head to my backup choice.  It was then that, I assume, the manager comes out asking if I'm looking for seating for one and would I like to come back in he has a table for me in the back.  My server, Amanda, was friendly and wonderful.  New Yorkers can be plenty nice but we hate the phrase \"the big apple\".  Not sure how folks from Charlotte feel about \"southern hospitality\" but this was true southern hospitality.    Ordered a cab to drink and the ahi tuna entree salad - both delicious.  Then splurged and ordered sweet potato fries - which are as great as other Yelpers say.  Thanks, Village Tavern, for making this New Yorker right at home in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I was out to lunch with two very old friends and I have to say my focus was not entirely on the food as we caught up. The crab cake sandwich, while not particularly memorable, was good as was the potato salad. The butter cake was decadent and delusions. This is a must have dessert, if you save room. I look forward to coming back and having more from the menu."}
{"text":"Best pimento cheese burger on the planet. Great outside seating and a nice place to go for Sunday brunch.   Definitely recommend reservations for high traffic times and getting there early to find parking since the parking lot is super tight and still under construction.   Still a great place and a wonderful place to go have lunch on a beautiful day."}
{"text":"Outstanding! We decided to eat here, based on the positive reviews. So glad we did. I had the Pimento Cheese Bacon Burger with fries. The patty was a perfect medium and it was slathered with pimento cheese and sautéed onions, all held together by a brioche bun. Great, great burger. Dillon was our waiter, and his service was excellent. He was very attentive and helpful with selections.   I didn't want to pass up on dessert, but was full. I took a nice slice of the Double-Decker Cheesecake for later. My wife opted for the Butter Cake. Both were fabulous. I wholeheartedly recommend Village Tavern and Dillon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have gone to the Village Tavern several times because of its convenient location, good food, and the fact that there's usually not much of a wait time to be seated (it's a large space).   The salads are good, but the mac & cheese side dish is PHENOMENAL. Ask your server to substitute it for fries if you choose to get a burger or a sandwich. Our server recommended it the first time we went and it is addictive!"}
{"text":"Great food, especially the salads and burgers.  Like sitting out on the patio.  Service has been consistently good."}
{"text":"Lots of seating (love booths), delicious New England Clam chowder, and they gave us a free ice cream sundae after a minor mix up with the order.     Friendly service and would visit again."}
{"text":"Loved their Happy Hour. The pulled pork street tacos are outstanding. We plan to come back before we end our vacation in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The Service and the staff were great. The food on the other hand was bland. If this place had better food would of been four stars for sure."}
{"text":"Called tonight to make a reservation for 10 people outside to celebrate a very special event.  When we arrived, I was told by the hostess to put together my own table if I wanted to sit in the patio.  I was surprised so I asked her again if she wanted me to pull the tables together and she said yes unless she finds a busboy to do it.  We were sat at a table for 8 outside and given 4 menus.  The waitress then came over and told me that they really didn't want to add more tables unless I knew for sure other guests were coming as very often customers say that there will be more guests but they never show up.  I looked at her and thought to myself, is she for real!  I confirmed with her that in fact 4 more people were joining.  She never added the table, and 15 minutes had passed.  My friend and I moved over a round table to add more seating.  I asked the waitress for a tablecloth for the table and she gave me a very unhappy look.  I also requested more menus.  We soon placed our orders.  My husband's pork chops came 30 minutes after everyone had finished their food and half the table of guests had left (we were still charged for it). Waitress excuse was that when the cooks brought out the pork chops they were way too over cooked that she asked them to remake them.  My thought is that she forgot to put the order in.  At the end of our dinner, before presenting the check, the waitress became exceptionally sweet as if she was a different person.  She and the hostess had such a unwelcoming attitude towards us from the beginning, which was really too bad as we were all there to celebrate an occasion.  By putting up an act for the last few minutes before giving us a check was not going to make me want to give her a 20% tip.  I live very close to Village Tavern but will not return again.  I'm not sure if these people working today here were racist, but we sure felt like that. Just to add, my Dad asked for bread during dinner and the waitress told him that since it's closing time that she only had a few pieces left.  I looked at my watch and it was 9:20, the restaurant closes at 10.  It was a very disturbing experience, will never return!!! The whole group felt insulted by the end of the night!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had the salmon blackened and it was seasoned and cooked perfect. The mac & cheese is amazing. Will definitely return again. The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for dinner and I wasn't sure what to expect. I associate Tavern with Hickory Tavern. This is nothing close to it. Tavern is all they have in common. The restaurant is very nice although, we opted to sit outside. It was the best choice. They have such a pleasant outdoor seating area. The staff was very quick to help with getting our table set up. There was a light breeze that evening, music was playing and they have strung lights that come on. I enjoyed seeing the green grass and the trees swaying in the wind. We ordered the crab cake dip and we were worried it wouldn't come with enough bread. We asked for the bread basket but it turned out that the bread that comes with the dish was more than enough. I ordered coffee and it was perfect. The crab cake dip was so good. I ordered the crab cakes and they were very meaty and accompanied by the tarter sauce, they are the best crab cakes I've ever had. The drinks, the food, the service and atmosphere are perfect."}
{"text":"Love the Village Tavern!  Their late night happy hour is wonderful and sitting at the bar just feels like home.  The bartenders are great and always make you feel special.  I've met some great people there too.    Try the flatbread or the app with smoked salmon, shrimp and cheese.  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I had a business lunch here this week and it's the first time I've been here in many years. This place has really changed for the better. It still brought back many fond memories of my college days when we would show up on a Friday evening and party on the huge patio! Good times! Ok, back to the review...this place was packed for a Tuesday at 11:45am. That's always a good sign. I ordered the blackened chicken alfredo and it was on point. The price wasn't bad either, $12.95. You have to expect that when in the SouthPark area. The service was fast and friendly. I will be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise!  Absolutely the best prime rib in Scottsdale!  DH had the pork chops and they were great too!  Great service and reasonably priced.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Village Tavern and I would happily return to this well established restaurant. Our group ordered a wide variety of entrees and each one was delicious. I had the blackened chicken Alfredo. The \"blackened\" was tastefully seasoned. It did not burn your mouth with spices. It was very good.  We tried the Very Best Carrot cake and the Warm Butter cake for dessert. Both are LEGENDARY!   They were ridiculously delicious. The service could have been more attentive but they were friendly enough. It is a large restaurant and a bit noisy. There is a nice outside seating area. Good place for large groups and gatherings."}
{"text":"Village Tavern is okay. The food is good, the wine list is okay, but as usual it's really just another chain restaurant. We received 100 pts. for booking on Open Table and we did that on a Sunday night 45 min before we got there. Lucky we did because the wait was 45-50 minutes. Not really worth it for a chain restaurant.  Overall I'm glad we tried it. It just won't be at the top of my list to go back to anytime soon. It's a great place for Scottsdale tourists."}
{"text":"Royalty - that's how I felt when I arrived with my group of 16.  Our table was ready and we were immediately escorted to our table in a move so smooth it felt like I was floating.  Not only did our server get drinks out quickly but with no hesitation he let us know how many would be served by an appetizer mixed tray.   Most of the table enjoyed the red meat - and I consistently heard raves - especially from those who were eating the prime rib.  I ordered the spaghetti squash.  I was totally thrilled to find something so healthy and brimming with zuchinni, tomatos and fresh parmesan."}
{"text":"This place is really nice. My first visit but not my last. My wife had salmon which she said was excellent and I had meatloaf which was the best I have ever eaten. Better than even home made. Out server was very efficient, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, nice open kitchen, big booths.  This place was really nice (and really packed at lunch time).  I took some suggestions from other yelpers and went with the prime rib and it was really good.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  I would recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"To start the food here is awesome. And here comes the but.. The service is mediocre at best, but tonight was terrible. I came here with two people, and I believe they were very dismissive to us. I do not know if it was because of our age, gender, or what but what we received was unacceptable. Were told three different things about where to sit and the wait time before we were then told they weren't sitting anyone. I just felt disrespected.."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better in food and service.  Should there EVER be a time when the food is not right,  they act on it like 'white on rice' to bring  you another meal as quickly as possible. Become a regular there, and it's like being treated like family. I befriended Paul, the General Manager there and was surprised and  impressed that he suggested that I go and try other restaurants out. He apparently views life as being abundant and knows that what goes around, comes back... and he's right! Thank you folks at Village Tavern for making my years of dining with you memorable and pleasurable... And also for remembering that I like a certain table and a certain dish... You far exceeded my expectations!  Hugs to your heart, Ron B"}
{"text":"Just came back from opening day of Spring Training for the S.F. Giants....while in Scottsdale needed to find a nice place to eat.....remembered eating at Village Tavern a few years ago and decided to return.  It's the busy season, so we did have to wait 30 minutes, BUT well worth the wait.  We were seated in Patrick B.'s section....and what a treat.  He has a great sense of humor and an excellent memory...and we tested him when we kept changing our order.  Everything came out exactly as ordered and tasted great.  Thanks for the great food and the outstanding service!!!"}
{"text":"Brunch here is a nice kept secret and be prepared for a good wait if you don't have reservations after 11 am for brunch.   The food was cooked to a degree of near perfection. I tried about three different plates considering we had a large group of about 14 people.   I ordered the Brie and bacon omelette and the Brie was cooked just right ! I have to say the best omelette still goes to pancake house on cherry street!   I tried the crab cakes and they were lightly seasoned and delicious with a light brown flaky crust.   This place can be difficult to find because of construction but more difficult because you don't think a restaurant belongs here. Be sure to google or yahoo map it here as parking is in the front.   Nevertheless, I think terrace cafe is better and Nolen's on Sewlyn , but I would say this place is better than about 80% of brunch paces out there and worth the try!"}
{"text":"Sunday breakfast on the patio was great. Our server Stephanie was wonderfull. Will be back  for sure."}
{"text":"yummy ! Tasty new England Clam Chowder with the appetizer wedge salad ! great taste and value . good , friendly service ."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Village Tavern. The food isn't knock your socks off amazing but it's solid and it happens to be near work. We end up going there a lot.  I often get the mustard pepper burger. It's good. I dig it. No matter what I get though, I ALWAYS order the home made chips. I've been a fan of home made chips since I first had them at Goldie's a million years ago. I'll get these wherever they have them. Village Tavern does a good rendition.   Yesterday I got the crab cake sandwich which was also quite good. I also had a bowl of clam chowder. It wasn't awesome but it did the job.  I will say that for some reason I like the crazy lemonade they do & can't get enough of it. It's got like a tiny bit of carbonation to it. While I wasn't sure if I even liked it at first, it's grown on me & I'll go at least 3 or 4 deep at a minimum.  The other thing I do dig there is the crab dip appetizer. Again, it's nothing unbelievable but I've just come to like it.  So while I wouldn't offer the Village Tavern up if people were asking about great food, it kind of has a weird place in my heart and we go there quite a lot for work meetings."}
{"text":"Party of five on a very busy Christmas eve eve night.  The staff is always friendly though the greeter/seaters are more efficient than friendly.  Our server was over the top personable and helpful.  She was so genuine and friendly and really one of the top ten best in my experience.    BBQ ribs, tender fall off the bone and tasty without being cloying. The bruschetta was a hit with the whole table and the portion was huge, one order could be easily shared by two.  Pork chop was cooked to perfection and lightly seasoned paired with the mashed potatoes, just like mom makes, maybe a little better!  Overall, we visit Village Tavern every couple months and are always impressed, how do they do it!"}
{"text":"An extremely warm feel from the instant you walk through the doors.  I've eaten here for lunch and dinner, with guests, clients and family.  Its consistent - good food,  service and atmosphere.  Whether you choose to sit in the bar area or in the dining room Its always been a good experience.  I've NEVER been disappointed.  If you are a fan of meatloaf - you have to get it at lunch.  Try the Warm Butter Cake for desert.  They have a fairly diverse menu.   Recently had the Shrimp Scampi and Caesar Salmon - both good."}
{"text":"Third time is a charm. Went here against this time ordered the Cobb with dressing on the side and my salad was delicious. Good wine and charming young lady who served us. Good non-payment to redeem yourself."}
{"text":"Recently went here Sunday for a birthday brunch - there was only 12 of us, 2 seep rate tables, 2 separate servers. We sat down and it was over 20 mins before I got fed up and had to flag down a server for drinks. Another 20 minutes went by before the server came back to take a food order, god knows what was taking so long, it wasn't busy and I'm pretty sure we were her only table. The servers were all aware it's a birthday brunch yet made little or no effort to accommodate this. We had to wait over 20 minutes again for our food to start trickling in. 3 people got their food - 5 minutes went past, another two, another 5 minutes and 2 plates Came out. By his time some food had been sat there 10 minutes going cold and some hadn't even been served including the birthday girl! One order came out wrong so had to be sent back, finally the remaking food came out so we could eat. Mine was now cold as were others but we ate as were hungry. Once we had all finished the remaining plate came out to eat when everyone was finished.  There was no apology. No explanation as to what happens and why it all took so Long. The food was ok - slightly over priced for what it was but ok. If I had the option, I wouldn't choose to go here again and I feel sorry for the birthday girl here as no one really had a good time.  Of you go, make sure you have nothing to do for the rest of the day and take an iPad of book to keep you entertained"}
{"text":"This is a lovely irish-style-pub-restaurant with a beautiful outside patio. I've always received good service here and have never even had to wait to be seated, despite being mostly full each time. They have a good variety of wine & beer with a full bar and their menu is varied enough to suit most. This place is great for everything...a quick drink after work, small dinner with friends, even just for dessert! As others have said, the patio is huge with a lovely view and definitely the best place to be, as it is elevated and has fountains built into the walls beneath. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went to VT for brunch last Sunday. They say it's hard to mess breakfast up but trust me, I've seen it happen. Village Tavern's serves up a very nice & tasty brunch..  Loved the.... 1. Coffee + creamer that they bring out individually  2. Ham & Cheddar Omelet - excellent 3. Waiter let me sub the awesome blue & blackberries instead of the potatoes (thank you!) 4. the Muffin  Also loved the décor inside. We sat at the newer community tables because there was a little wait for our own. Everything was great and I will soon be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Love meat and potatoes? This might be the place for you.   I met some girlfriends here for lunch. Turns out, it's really not one of those \"ladies who lunch\" places. It's dark and clubby, reminiscent of old-fashioned men's clubs that you see in movies. There are lots of private booths, mostly filled with men in suits talking business and / or sports. If only this were the 1960's, Don Draper and the other Mad Men guys would be smoking cigarettes and drinking martinis in the corner booth.   The food is primarily meat and potatoes. Yes, they do have other things on the menu, but it's the steak, prime rib, and hamburgers that really shine. When ordering, I attempted to strike a compromise between beef and veggie healthy. So I ordered the tenderloin teriyaki stir fry. The aroma and presentation were good, but the meat was definitely not tenderloin filet. It was chewy and grisly, perhaps the castoffs of the high quality steaks served to others? One of my friends ordered the double bacon cheeseburger with sweet potato fries; a bold choice among the \"ladies who lunch\" group. But her burger was big and juicy, and she said it tasted great. She loved her sweet potato fries, crisp and a hint of cinnamon.   Village Tavern is all about the meat and potatoes; just don't go there expecting a nice light lunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting Scottsdale and wanted something more like home (Kansas City) and found this place online.  Steaks and prime rib sounded like the ticket, so we went on a Friday evening.  Large, nice place, and our server was a delight.  But the food (and relatively low prices) stole the show.  We started out with a Caprese salad that was very good - the tomatoes were every bit as tasty as heirlooms.  For our entrees,  my wife had grilled meatloaf, which was two large slices of meatloaf, grilled, topped with a mushroom Madeira sauce and served over smashed potatoes along with string beans.  I got the larger cut prime rib with smashed potatoes and spinach.  We both loved our dishes and washed it down with a decent inexpensive bottle of Shiraz.  We finished by sharing the carrot cake.  But despite the excellent food and service, everything was very reasonably priced.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to say that I went to the Village Tavern when I was told that they had homemade potato chips with some type of ranch dipping sauce, now although that sounds like a heart attack in a meal, I was game.   Well we were hesitant so they actually let us taste them for free. Now that's good service.   The food was good although not particularly memorable. I mean literally I can't remember what I ordered but the memory of the chips remain!  Oh that's right it was the scallops over fresh succatash which were  really good although not too filling.   Village Tavern, most random location ever, but the chips are good!"}
{"text":"What can I say -- this is one of my favorite places in  Charlotte.  I love the ambience, bar, noise level good, food and service are great. I was in town for only a couple of days, and this place was on my mind.  We typically bring our own bottle of wine, and their cork fee is minimal. We had a late reservation, so got their early, sat at the bar--great cocktails and had the crab dip.  Once we sat down for dinner, my dining companion and I both had the steak au poivre - can't beat it!!! Overall, always a wonderful experience, the wait staff are always personable, and the ma get makes his way around the dining room."}
{"text":"I admit it...I like potato chips:)  Back when there was about 60 pounds more of me to love, you could say I really liked potato chips:)  But still, if you are looking at the classic \"nutrition pyramid\"...potato chips are stuffed in there at the tippy top, along with perfectly grilled bone-in rib eye's, single malt scotch whiskey and Dungeness crab legs...all good things and good for you, too:)  At the Village Tavern, they have an appetizer called Colorado Potato Chips...freshly fried potato chips...with a bunch of junk on them.  But, if you ask them nicely, they will bring you just a plate of the chips, all fresh and warm and salty, right out of the fryer...without all the rest of the toppings:)  Now that's an accompaniment:)  A grace note, if you will:)  The Beautiful Carin and I stopped by the other evening... we hadn't been there in several months, and Sarah G's review reminded me that I have missed the good old Village Tavern.  They pour a nice drink at the VT and have a \" 1/2 price on any and every drink\" Happy Hour, so we had a couple of inexpensive KetelOne marti's and decided to have an early dinner:)  I had the Maple Cured Pork Chop and Carin had their Teriyaki Chicken...both were very good!  At VT, they also make a decent prime rib, some very serviceable burgers, a crab cake sandwich that really uses real crab and tastes like a crab cake should (no, it won't transport you to Newport News, but it's good:), and a Chinese Chicken Salad that always seems to draw me in:)  I've had all of these menu items before (and several other items as well) and never had a bad meal:)  In other words...good, solid tavern/road house fare...except for the chips:)  They transcend the genre and make VT a place worth returning to from time to time (not too often...got to watch the cholesterol:)  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service has always been very pleasant and friendly:)  I never feel that the staff is trying to \"optimize\" me or turn the table quickly.  And finally, in a rare \"double\", I need to give a five star shout out to the Village Clubs...by showing my membership card for the Village Clubs at VT, I get a 15% discount on the entire bill:)  I know...it's a chain and I do like to buy local, but come on...Village Tavern has those potato chips...Fresh, Warm, Perfect Potato Chips!  Potato Chips...Just when I thought I was out...they pulled me back in:)"}
{"text":"Warm potato chips. OMG. They are the best. I have been going to this restaurant for years and have never had a bad meal. It's a place I take out of town friends too because it's not a place they have in their state. Service is always great too."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour and had a couple drinks and a few appetizers . The flat bread was delicious , the nachos had a lot of potential but when it came out there was only a few good bites and the rest were just plain empty chips . The French fries were really good , thin and crispy . The margaritas were good . Im just gonna go with that the service was a little off at my visit , we didn't get asked about anything or checked on at all . We had to flag someone down in order to get new drinks and waters ..... it was a pretty busy place so I'll be back to give a second chance ."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch/lunch spots.. the mexican omlete is amazing, I sub the black olives for black beans (theirs are super good!), the seasoned potatoes are good, fruit fresh and the muffin hot and tasty. They have an excellent patio to dine on when its nice). I have eaten a few lunch dishes but their breakfast menu is the way to go."}
{"text":"This place redeemed itself with the excellent customer service provided by the manager, Paul. We had a bad experience with an amateur waitress but Paul made it right and we gave it another try. Everything was excellent the second time around. I wish all managers would pride themselves on customer service. It goes a long way."}
{"text":"Went to the Village Tavern yesterday for Sunday brunch with a friend. It was a great experience! We asked for bread to start, which has to be requested. We partially needed the bread just so we would have more time to look over the large selection of food. I ordered the fried calamari as a starter and it was seriously the best calamari I have ever had. The sauce was very flavorful with a little bit of heat. For my main dish, I ordered the Tavern Flatbread. I had asked for no peppers, but when it came the peppers were there and pepperoni was missing. I was not going to say anything but the server remembered that I asked for the peppers off. I told the server it was okay and I would just pick them off. However, the manager came over, took that item off the bill and then assured me that another flatbread would be made. They put that in a to go box for me and I was all set. The food was good and the customer service was excellent. I really enjoyed the trip and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Another solid choice if you're staying (or living) in the area. We were at the Hyatt Regency nearby and came here for dinner. It was nice, but not too nice. Casual, but not too casual. One of those goldilocks choices. We thoroughly enjoyed our chicken and our daughter devoured her children's prime rib. That's right, children's prime rib. I'd recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Not too good!  both my husbands and my meals were well below average. I had the Asian tuna salad and he had the fish and chips. The fish tasted like freezer burn. The flavors in the salad did not go well together and the tuna was very fatty.  The 'bread upon request' was actually delicious as was my sangria. This is why I assigned 2 stars.  Service was average.  Would not return."}
{"text":"Small place with good ambience.  The food was good.  I would go back again.  The service was good.  Nice selection on the menu."}
{"text":"You know what, I like this place.  It is easy to forget about good ol' Village Tav!   They are tucked away and removed from the mainstream \"southpark area\" so it is easy to forget they are there!  But, I am glad that we stopped in this past weekend.  It was a good reminder that this staple, south Charlotte location has every right to still be alive and well.  I ordered their spaghetti zucchini/squash dish.  It was incredible.  It had fresh broccoli and cauliflower mixed in with the garlic/olive oil and tomato sauce.  It had great texture and flavor and was just the right portion!  I left feeling healthy and satisfied!    Hubs ordered a \"gourmet burger\" but the only red flag is that he was not asked how he would like it cooked.  That can sometimes mean frozen patty or that it isn't made to order in some way.  It ended up being decent but not amazing.    They have so many  great options on the menu to choose from, such as pizza, fish, sandwiches, their homemade potato chips, dips, nachos, pastas, etc.  There is certainly something for everyone.  I had their crabcake meal a few months back and I have to say it was the best crabcake I have had in Charlotte.....hands down.  It had huge pieces of crab that were juicy and very fresh pouring out of the patty.  It was not stuffed with breadcrumbs or some other filler...it was really 95% crab.  It was a while ago that I had it so I need to get an update on the crab situation soon .    The atmosphere appears to be a bit pretentious when you first walk in.  It is lined with dark wood, a pretty vibrant bar scene, candles and dim lighting.  The outdoor patio is huge and they have a ton of specials going on throughout the week, including live music.  The prices and the menu itself let's you know that they are down to earth and you are welcomed even if you didn't just wrap up your 18th hole.   Are you going to see some loafers and khaki's?  Sure.  But were we perfectly comfortable in our jeans, beaters and t-shirts?  Sure were.    Overall it is a diversified spot that has many benefits and is worth keeping on your radar for a decent night out."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed to only give this place 2 stars I've been coming here for years and it's slowly declined over time as far as servers and food quality. Today went with my husband and was really disappointed I ordered the shrimp Scampi and subbed the pasta for a salad , they brought out my 5 lonely shrimp on a bed of lettuce. I would have liked to have my shrimp marinate in the garlic butter sauce for flavor because I don't think the cook even used anything to flavor them , my husband ordered his usual burger and fries , The fries were completely old and hard as well as the flavor and temp of burger tasted like it had been sitting back there for a long time. Server never brought salad dressing and water that were requested $50 later we had to stop off at hr grocery store to go grab some food to fill us up after such a disappointing meal :( hopefully management will step up and make some changes because I use to love this place but for awhile I won't be back"}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I finished our salon appointments at the same time and had a free hour for lunch so we chose Village Tavern. I used to go in Winston-Salem all the time as an undergrad at Wake so every time I go here, it's nostalgic.   Parking was \"extra special\" today for some reason and it took some time to find one. We ended up walking quite a bit. Parking has been an issue every time I have gone to this location in Charlotte. But, it was worth the hassle.  Despite the lunchtime rush, we were warmly greeted and seated quickly. Our server was gracious and honored my tight time commitment; I had a waxing appointment to get to!  We decided to do quick appetizers and wine. Our glasses were brought to us immediately. Never make me wait for wine! And appetizers followed shortly after.  We split hot crab dip (what I always got while at Wake) and ahi tuna. Both were delicious!  I had to rush out early but enjoyed the brief visit to an old-time favorite."}
{"text":"After evacuating Florida and S. Carolina due to hurricane Irma, we arrived in Charlotte, NC. Our hotel recommended this restaurant and we were  so pleasantly surprised!   The food, the atmosphere and the staff were fabulous! The welcoming staff, especially Nash, the mgr. ,was so helpful. The food was delicious..... great menu and large portions! The restaurant just underwent a $500k renovation and it looks great!  When in Charlotte stop here for brunch, lunch or dinner and enjoy the outside firepit! Yum!!"}
{"text":"There is such a thing as \"Grilled Meatloaf\". And everyone should experience this wonder.  It's not my mother's meatloaf. (Shh! Sorry Mom. This is better. I'm really very sorry.)  Tucked on a corner of the The Shops at Gainey Village is a quaint little restaurant, complete with an outdoor patio.   Alas, the patio and I were not properly introduced as the super comfortable looking loungers and tables were already scooped up. Instead, my friends and I were greeted like friends at the bar and found three (count 'em, three) stools right in a row waiting for us.  I don't know if the patio is always this super busy, as this was the 1st Thursday of the month. There's music 1st Thursdays (until March of 2014) in the center area of the shopping area with different live bands.  I do know that reservations are not taken for the patio area. It's first come, first serve! So hurry kids, hurry! Those seats look mahhvelous.  Given how delish the food was I can understand why. Hoh Boy.  Our group took the hearty advice of Rick, a super bomb diggity bartender, and went with the \"hot crab dip\". The serving size is large and plenty for a group of three. If I were to attempt this at home I'd perhaps throw in a hint more spice. (Maybe a touch of celery.) But really, this gal was sassy pants happy scooping away at the dip. The provided copious amounts of toast to enjoy the dip which was rather nice.  My friends shared a Cobb Salad. I had to laugh at them. The serving size was gigantic. HUGE. I turned away the opportunity to sample what looked like a wonderful salad.   I was being single minded in my determination to eat AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE of my meat loaf. (My friends said the Cobb was very much to their liking. They eat out quite a bit, so I take their word for it.)  Grilling meatloaf put a new spin on it for me. Ok, fine. The menu does say \"Family Specialty\". I was majorly bummed this morning when I remembered my left-overs where not, in fact, in my apartment. They were sacrificed in the name of car pooling.  Yes, that happened. My heavenly grilled meat loaf was sent off to a better life. And I did not get to enjoy left-overs today.  I will go back to the Village Tavern and eat this again.  Thank you Rick the Bartender for a *great* recommendation!  (Also, you were a wonderful server!)  Oh! And the house red is a new friend of mine. (Five bucks!)   Can't go wrong here.  UPDATE! UPDATE! I sat on the patio! No wonder this spot is hard to come by. Very large area with super fine seating. Comfy. So comfy no one wants to get up :)   This time my visit was during a Sunday brunch slot. Boy! No joke. 11:30 is a popular time. We were super lucky and scored the last table. On a Saturday, I doubt this would ever happen. (I heard men dragging their families inside with, \"NO. We have to sit inside so I can watch \"the\" game.\" Yay for me! I mean, us. There was a group of us :)"}
{"text":"Kaitlyn was absolutely delightful. She was so personable and made our night that much better. Such a breath of fresh air to get such amazing service and such great food. My boyfriend loved his steak and for the money you get two large sides. We're going home in a food coma right now."}
{"text":"Outstanding Ribs, Great Shrimp Scampi, wonderful beer selection, and a truly outstanding Server, Dominica who maid our meal Fun."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day brunch. Four in our party, cousins came from out of town. Was excited because of the reviews. Ordered Spinach dip, spring rolls and crab cake for starters. Spinach dip was tasteless with hard stale tasting chips. Sent back and got another spring roll which took too long but we enjoyed. Our food was served to three of us as we were informed as the food was arriving that they were out of waffle/French toast batter.  Completely unacceptable.  We should have been notified before the meals were served. It was Mother's Day Sunday Brunch and it was not busy. Not sure how they ran out of such an important ingredient. The person's food that was left out had a four hour drive back to Atlanta following brunch so her meal was ruined because her reorder did not come until we were just about ready to go. The others meals were less than desirable as well. My daughters crab benedict came with well done boiled eggs on top, my cousins blacked chicken alfredo  was bland with runny alfredo sauce, and my nuevos rancharos was just blah with canned black beans. The manager was very kind and understood our frustration and took care of the bill. He sent us their famous butter cake which was fine; however it did not make up for a ruined Mother's Day dining experience.  I felt doubly bad since I suggested the Village Tavern and it was terrible."}
{"text":"This is a long overude update since my last review in April 2013.  In late 2014, Paul C, a great Yelper informed me about the renovations and menu changes Village Tavern made. He swore it was worth giving it another try. So, I took him up on grabbing some dinner and have since been back several times.    The interior of the restaurant has been updated, more open and modern and not so dark as it was years ago.  The menu has kept some great staples, added some new additions, and I heard there is a new chef, which may explain the happiness we have had in the food. I have been for brunch and dinner and enjoyed a variety of items, but the crab cake dinner/sandwich and fries stands out. The fries are cooked just the way I like them. A little thicker and with the perfect amount of salt. And, one funny note. I don't typically mention a house salad, but they could have served one of the freshest house salads I have ever had, and it was huge. Served with lettuce, cucumbers, tomato, croutons and egg, it was great. And, try the Village Vinegerette, loved it!  I will forever thank Paul for making me give Village Tavern another try and think of him everytime I am there. Check it out.. Oh, and don't forget to try and enjoy the patio on a nice night."}
{"text":"For family of 28, all ages who gathered for a reunion, the wait staff from Kevin on were delightful and patient. Very very patient.   Food good, a plate went a long way. Our 3 separate checks perfect.   So go there whether two of you or a boisterous family. You'll be very welcome."}
{"text":"Fabulous Lunch Specials!  My hubby had the Prime Rib with Garlic Mashed and Asparagus for under $17.  A great piece of meat and oh so tender. I had their Grilled Salmon- my go to!  Great service from Teri. Packed at lunch so make reservations."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Amanda behind the bar being one of the main reasons we keep coming back!  Food is consistently good and the drink specials are solid!  Hidden gem in the south park area...that is unless you live here!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I came here for lunch (now that I don't work in SouthPark). It's less packed than I remember, which is good, because parking is always a nightmare here. My friend and I sat outside on the patio, which was nice and quiet (only 1 or 2 other tables out there). Waitress did well in general, given the fact that we're her only table outside.   We were able to get in and out in an hour, more or less, which is a key for any lunch spots on a work day. My half and half (half chicken club and soup) was solid for $8.95. My friend's roast beef rueben (whole sandwich with a side of fries) was pretty big portion for $11.95 (and a big sloppy mess to eat). The fried calamari $9.95 was good, but not sure if it's worth the price.  Crazy thing is I really wanted the trout, that was my favorite lunch dish there for the longest time, but I just cannot see myself spending $18.95 for lunch! The salmon entree was cheaper.    Village Tavern has always been a solid spot in South Park. They still have happy hours specials (4-6). And it's one of the nicest patio space to enjoy a nice day out."}
{"text":"Went here during lunch for my birthday last Monday with my girls. I thought that it was pretty good. It was a bit hard to find for me and for all of my friends but thankfully we found the restaurant. Our server was nice. I think that maybe he was annoyed by my cousin's vegan questions which honestly I would've been annoyed also but he did a good job at helping her out with it. He recommended some drinks for us and then ended up buying mine since it was my birthday which I thought was sweet. Hope to come here again with my boyfriend some time.  Appetizer: Flash fried calamari - loved it entree: chicken colorado - pretty good drink: (forgot what it was called but it had the word 'cuban' in it) - pretty good, i also tried the painkiller which i thought was good also"}
{"text":"Amazing ahi tuna sashimi. Wasnt dry and was seared perfectly. The prime rib was juicy and tender. Server was fantastic! Never had to ask for more tea, he even brought ice when it got warm from sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"Great comfort food, large menu. The Godiva dessert was delicious too. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We have been at this Village Tavern MANY times.  Their prime rib is absolutely amazing but so is the rest of their menu.  I am in a prime rib rut but I love it every time.  The other plates on the table look wonderful also.  My wife generally orders fish, others might order a flat bread or salad, but everyone thoroughly enjoys their meal.  Like many others, we always order the butter cake which has an amazing flavor.   We always share it because it's too much by the time we are done eating but everyone dives in hard when it arrives at the table.  Great service, great environment, has a separate pub area.  Great place to try."}
{"text":"A little on the expensive side, the Village Tavern is in the South Park area and is appropriately priced for that neighborhood. It's across the street from my office, so we're in here often.  Don't miss their own made chips with ranch dressing. Excellent on the side with one of their burgers instead of fries, they are just as good as a shared appetizer if you're just having drinks.  Speaking of burgers, don't miss 'em. Good quality meat with the right toppings, or get one of their pizzas. I like the margretira which has sliced tomatoes and fresh basil.  I've been here a bunch of times and I'll be back again a bunch more!"}
{"text":"New to the area and checking out local places to eat. Found them on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Seating in the dining room was a 55min wait, for one person, but the bar area was open seating. Anna was my waitress and she couldn't have been friendlier! She chatted with me a bit and helped me make a decision on my meal. Anna checked on me frequently to ensure my drink was filled and that my meal was to my liking. I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Where do we head on special occasions? You are right if you said Village Tavern. Paul And Brain made it so special for our friends who were celebrating their wedding anniversary. As the host they made me look good and I love looking good. The filet mignon, ribs, and burgers were great. Thanks to VT!!!"}
{"text":"Worse service in town.  Food is average at best.  Prepare to be ignored."}
{"text":"Nice place. More upscale than a \"pub\" ...menu wise that is. I had a newer item..chicken tacos. each one had a alrge deep fried/crusty chicken finger in it ( I was expecting more shredded chicken)  They were pretty tasty and had a nice spice. Harder to each with one large chunk of chicken though. The table we were at was a little warn and slightly sticky. They could use to take a step up on cleanliness. take everything off the table when you clean it so its done right."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need some regular, American food with reasonable prices without having to go to a Fridays or the like.  This place definitely fits the bill.  I had a burger and the boyfriend had the grilled chix sandwich.  Service has quick and friendly.  Paris got thrown back in jail while we were in the restaurant and the whole bar area was all in conversation about it - too funny!!!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! They are very busy but the staff is polite and always trying to make it the best experience."}
{"text":"We are regulars here and the food is always consistently good, as is the service.  It's exactly what you expect from a neighborhood restaurant with a large bar, welcoming staff and high quality food.  I especially like that the kitchen is open and visible to the dining room.  Their ribs are outstanding, as is most of the fish I've tried.  I would give it 5 stars except that I've had times where I'm there late into the evening, and the staff start to get a little 'slack' and aren't responsive to getting your check, change, etc...  I know they're eager to go home, but they still need to finish up their tables and make sure customers have what they need.  Other than that - we love this place and will keep going back."}
{"text":"Great happy hour during the week all drinks are half price and some food specials. Saturdays from 2-5 have $2 menu and drinks."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after seeing the chef on Sonora Living. Went to the website and saw it had a pretty appealing menu and high ratings. Well I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong...the selection and prices were right but the seasoning was off. We had the scallops wrapped in bacon which was too salty even with the maple on it. Our chicken entree with a side of beans and rice was even saltier. Disappointing. Maybe I just got the wrong dishes? Nevertheless, won't be coming back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Had great prime rib with my wife last night. We sat outside at the fire pit, server was great! Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Looks much fancier on the inside than the outside. However be sure to dress-up, casual doesn't really cut it here.   Service was slooooow - food was alright, but nothing too exciting.   Best Tip about this place: If you're under the age of 40 you'll be treated like you're 15 and your mom just dropped you off at the mall."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since they 1st opened forever ago! I'm so glad my friend suggested it because it was by far, the best lunch I've had in a while. 1st off, our servers name was Lori and she was outstanding! She was so incredibly accommodating with all my special requests. I loved it! She made a few recommendations for us and Nick went with the BLT with pimento cheese spread. Bacon was a bit sweet, cheese spread was delicious and the tomato and lettuce were crisp and fresh. We started with the amazing french onion soup. Nice broth, creamy cheese and great flavor. I had this pimento,bacon burger but got a blackened chicken breast instead of a burger. I asked for sweet potato and regular fries mixed and Lori got my order all correct. We got some creme brulee to top off this fantastic meal and it was a tad boozy...we couldn't pin point the flavor but maybe it was rum? Awesome nonetheless. Our mango ice-t was kept full, our bill came in a timely manner and Lori was super pleasant. Nick pointed out that we could eat here all the time and not order the same thing twice! Challenge accepted."}
{"text":"Ate here last night very nice atmosphere but I got the ribeye which came with a salad option.  I ordered the tavern salad, it had no blue cheese, bacon or salad dressing......ok it was a salad  The ribeye was decent cooked to medium, I wasn't eating it thinking wow this is a great ribeye that being said it's a nice place.  Adding another star because the manager goes out of the way to make sure customer is satisfied"}
{"text":"Went for the first time on a business lunch around 12 and was very impressed.  It was already packed so we had to drive around for a parking space but luckily it didn't take long.    Dining: Seating was full at the regular tables with a 30 minute wait so we decided to sit at the family style high top tables, which was pretty neat! Since it was first come first serve seating and there was only 2 of us, we found a spot quickly.   Service: Awesome! I hate I forgot our waitresses name because she was the best. I tend to yelp everything when trying new places so I already had an idea of what I wanted from the lunch menu. I happened to mention to my lunch partner that I read how good the cajun seafood pasta was but it is only served at dinner so I would have to come back...he asked the waitress if it was possible to get it for lunch, she was so sweet and went to ask if it could be made...I was so excited when she said the chef would make it for me!   Food: Order the hot crab dip and thank me later.  Delish! My seafood pasta was so good and full of shrimp and scallops (I asked for no sausage). It has a spicy kick just like I wanted.  I was too stuffed to try dessert but will definitely be back to taste the warm butter cake I read about!"}
{"text":"Nice place, interior ambiance is great! Food options and prices are reasonable. Fairly large menu with lots of alcohol options. Our server was quick, polite and kept our drinks topped off. We came during the dinner rush and the kitchen was ready to crank out meals, ordered our food and had it on the table within 15-20 minutes.   I got the grilled meatloaf - it was delicious, most definitely grilled, not heavy or greasy feeling, could taste the seasoning, yummmm...perfect meatloaf."}
{"text":"Hate to downgrade, this used to be a favorite. Quality of food just isn't what it used to be a year or two ago. 4 of us, long time customers all feel the same. Fish and chips, mediocre at best. Fries tasted bagged, not fresh. Come on, at these prices , can't get a decent fried potato? Wedge salad came out with browned , refrigerator stale iceberg lettuce. No excuse, the chef had to have seen it, served it anyway. This place once served quality meals.  Did they hire one of those 21 year old MBA's to figure out how to cut costs? Well, I guess less customers means less expense! Won't be returning unless we hear of management change."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful meal with my wife. Our server Kristen was superb.  Ribs, Mexican corn, loaded baked potato all excellent. Wife had deviled egg appetizer, margarita flatbread and dinner salad.  Very reasonably priced!  Thanks Kristen and Village Tavern for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"First time here.  Tried the Hong-Kong-Style Chilean Sea Bass, Shrimp Scampi (plenty of Shrimp), French Onion Soup, and Key Lime Pie.  All were very good!!!  Especially the Key Lime Pie.  Homemade crust."}
{"text":"A long time ago I vowed never to come here again after a terrible experience when I first moved here.  For years you heard this advertised on a popular radio show so you assume if so and so promote it all the time it has to be good.  Well my first experience was horrible but again that was over 15 years ago.  So tonight I was in the southpark area and decided to give VT another shot.  After all, everyone deserves a second chance, even if it is 15 years later.  Apparently this was group night as I was seated next to one large group and there was another one at the the other end of the dining room.  The place was loud!! -- a little louder than I'd consider comfortable.  I mean I couldn't even hear my waiter tell me the dinner specials.  Service-wise it was average.  It took a while to take my drink order only to be told that their beer menu changed and what I wanted was no longer available.  Then it took a while for the drink to come out.  The menu was too broad.  There was a little bit of everything and not one real specialty which made it difficult to decide and not one thing really stood out to me so I went with Chicken Colorado which I've had before at various places under various names...Chicken breast with bacon topped with cheese, barbecue sauce, scallions and tomatoes.  It really didn't differ from anyone else's interpretation of it.   The food was decent but again it didn't really stand out.  Service was slightly better than the food but still not worthy of more than a 20% tip.  All an all, this is average.  The place reminded me of an upscale Applebee's and both points are not enough for me to make a 3rd trip."}
{"text":"Excellent service and a fantastic selection of food. We went for lunch and had the quiche lorraine which was fluffy and flavorful and the BLT egg sandwich which was equally delicious (I stole a bite).  It does seem to be a bit of an older crowd but the ambiance is nice because it feels quite private.I think the prices fit the quantity of food you get."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I showed up late to a team dinner here and after squeezing into spots at a big round table, I had limited time to peruse the menu and order.  Keeping it simple was the plan so, Wedge Salad, 10 oz. Filet and Baked Potato seemed like a good way to go.  The salad was an appropriate amount of fresh lettuce vs. the quarter of a huge head of iceberg some places serve.  It came with bacon and diced tomatoes and some very good blue cheese dressing.  The steak was cut somewhat thin and seemed small for a 10 oz. portion and was closer to medium than the medium rare I ordered.  This helped lead to a less than juicy piece of meat.  The baked potato was just fine as it's pretty hard to mess that up and came with butter and sour cream which was OK but it would have been nice to have been asked if I wanted that on top.  All in all, I give Village Tavern a high 3 stars and would be ok going back.  Not a destination place for me however in a town with the dining options Scottsdale has to offer."}
{"text":"Went in Sunday night for a quick bite and a coffee. Sat at the bar. The bartender, Jordan told us the espresso machine was broken, but we could order a drink....I have taken clients here in the past and it WAS a nice place.  I would think that an upscale establishment would have two machines capable of making coffee drinks....or maybe even offer to make a cup of damn coffee for a customer.  He did offer an Irish Coffee, so there must have been brew available.  I won't be back anytime soon. I really hate being lied to and getting shitty service."}
{"text":"You'll be blown away by the fab interior once you step inside from under the unassuming awning. This is my second visit, even though I've been wanting to come for months. The few times I could have visited, I didn't feel dressed enough to have a sit down. There were patrons dressed casually, but mostly everyone was a dressy casual.  I planned to have some calamari as an appetizer since I didn't try it last time, but my date chose the hot crab dip, and it sounded great to me. It tasted even better. I think he was saying it wasn't lump crab, but I couldn't hear much over my internal humming- the dish was great anyway. We even split the last chip! LOL   While I waited for my Cajun pasta, he had a salad and soup, both to his liking. He also chose the special Chilean Sea Bass with asparagus. We were taken aback by the small portion. At first, I thought it was a side, but that was his meal. Thankfully he ate those other dishes before. He said it was splendid, but felt that for the price a bigger piece would have been the right thing to do. I on the other hand, had more pasta than I could handle. The scallops were big and juicy! Perfect bites.  I still haven't made it out onto the huge patio yet, maybe next time."}
