{"text":"This is the best pizza delivery in the area for the price. I think my pizza was like $14 but was massive and they didn't skimp on the toppings. The cheese bread was absolutely delicious too. I'd compare this pizza to Rosati's quality but for an absolute fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"The best pizza in cottage grove. Delicious! Never stopped in there so im not sure how service is, my husband has and said it was great!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it three stars because the host was friendly and welcoming. The pizza was below average for a pizza buffet and the selection was not great. 

The establishment was acceptable and the service was very friendly. If they stepped up their game on the pizza quality then this could be a pretty hot place!

With any luck growth in Waunakee will force a number of these sleepy establishments to be more competitive."}
{"text":"Great pizza. But too expensive. I usually like breaded pizza like deep dish, but this thin crust pizza ranks as some of the best I've ever had. I just wish it didn't cost an arm and a leg or I'd order more often"}
{"text":"This is my third review of this place. We are over this place-NEVER AGAIN. Our last shot was ordering pizzas to pick up. We ordered 3 pizzas well in advance and were very specific on our pick up time-we didn't want to risk delivery time. We had 8 people at our house and needed the pizzas as expected. My husband and son went to pick up the pizzas. They arrived at the pick up time. They paid for the pizzas and then were told \"there was a problem with one of the pizzas and it would be a few minutes\". They waited 30 minutes! NO other explanation, no offers of a drink at the bar while they waited, no discount-NOTHING. My husband's take on it was the pizzas were not made until they arrived. The 3 pizzas were $80! Drive to Madison and get some delicious pizza at Roman Candle or Salvatores."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza - we were passing through town and tried this place out.  Thin cracker like crust (they do have other options).   Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Been to Doughboys four times. First two times were great no complaints, pizza and service were both very good! (Roughly two years ago.) The third time our order was incorrect twice. Recently decided to try again and was very let down. The place was dead, the wait for food was excessive. Hand tossed pizza lacked flavor, almost tasteless. Not impressed with the service. Two young girls working, had to ask for silverware and refills. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I called in an order for pick up. Picked it up and while walking out the door with the giant pizza box I thought \"hmmmm this seems light\". Well as soon as I got home I found out why. There was barely any cheese on the entire pizza! What the heck? Not at all like it used to be when they first opened. Disappointing. Good thing I had a $5 coupon."}
{"text":"One of our favorites.  The chicken bbq pizza is great as is the Hunter, which true to it's name is loaded with meat.  Service is friendly and fast.  

With a bar area and a separate restaurant area it is great for those with and without kids.  

Our only complaint is that they close kind of early and the lighting is too bright.  In a bar, I want to relax, not perform surgery."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza but it doesn't make up for the service.  The staff is rude especially if you don't tip them for carry out. I'm a very good tipper but I don't think it's called for when I'm picking up a pizza.  Delivering or serving it to me absolutely.  They will not look at you or say a single word to you as you leave, if you don't leave a tip.  Had enough of this and we won't be visiting them again."}
{"text":"The service was not all that great. We got the buffet, which was pretty good just not a lot of options. The cinnamon sticks were delicious."}
{"text":"This is a review of the lunch buffet.

First off, the pizza is great. So is the staff.  However , don't expect to get \"all you can eat\" at this buffet.  

The lineup usually features a whopping 3 to 4 pizzas at a time on the buffet.  Each time I've been there, the pizzas are picked over.  When they finally put out a fresh pie on the line, watch out.  The lunch patrons attack it like sharks to a sinking cruise ship.  I'm serious.  I've had some burly dude shove me out of the way to get a fresh slice.  I can't blame them when fresh slices are rare at this buffet.  Top tip- Doughboy's needs to be more on the ball with the freshness and number of choices here. 

 Today's lunch buffet consisted of 2 slices of cold cheese, a fresh cheeseburger pizza (it seemed that nobody wanted) and some BBQ chicken pizza.  What about the usual standby's?  Pepperoni, supreme....????   

There is a salad bar, usually featuring brown, wilted lettuce and a small variety of not so fresh vegetables and 1.5 croutons.  if you get a bread stick, consider your self lucky.  Maybe a trip to DeJope is in order.

If you want good pizza, Doughboy's will fill the bill.  If you want to leave full, skip the lunch buffet and order a pie for yourself.  The all you can eat lunch buffet will set you back 9 bones, and you'll leave hungry and angry.  I'd go elsewhere for a buffet that has plenty of choices and a pile of food."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Awesome family-friendly atmosphere with a great beer selection. Great place to entertain a group of people- kids can play in the game room and adults can grab a cold one. By far the best pizza in Waunakee! Try the chicken bacon ranch or mac and cheese pizza!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times. #1 there were 3 tables of people. My pizza took 45 minutes and was served burned to a crisp.  #2 there were 4 or 5 tables and the service was almost as slow as the firs time. #3 I went for the lunch buffet. It was ok at best. I won't be going again unless someone else is paying."}
{"text":"We went here on a whim because it was close to our friends house. We picked up two pizzas and two bread sticks. Everything was excellent. This is some of the best pizza in the Madison area. The crust is thin and crispy and they don't short you on toppings. The bread sticks are buttery, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The dipping sauce for the bread sticks is great as well. I am sure we will be back whenever we're in the Cottage Grove area."}
{"text":"The Greek Pizza is really delicious! It is so flavorful, with the feta and Kalamata olives, and the crust is perfect and crackery."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time. Won't do that again. It didn't taste fresh. It was hard. Had burnt pieces on it. Really disappointing..."}
{"text":"Terrible. The wings were soggy and had no flavor. The ranch dressing that came with it tasted like old mayonnaise. I've never seen anything like it. The pizza was flavorless. I rarely write reviews, it was that bad."}
{"text":"Doughboys has THE best pizza around. Their angry rooster pizza is to die for, and their breadsticks are unbelievable. At lunch they will make slices any way you want, I love that."}
{"text":"I was in town over lunch for work and thought i'd try this out.  It's a simple place in a strip mall but from my one trip I can say they have awesome pizza!  I ordered a 10\" chicken bacon ranch and a soda for $11.  The pizza was on very thin crust, perfectly done and delicious and cut into small squares, one of the best chicken bacon ranch pizza's i've had.  They also had free wifi and they were friendly but nobody bothered me  while I got a little work done over lunch too.  If i'm ever through Cottage Grove again it's a sure stop!"}
{"text":"I was going to eat lunch in the chain sub shop next door and looked up at a patron eating amazing looking breadsticks. I went in on a whim and ordered a slice and a breadstick for a very reasonable price. I asked what kind of pizza they had and they said \"what kind do you want?\".   I went with the buffalo chicken. The service was great, the food was excellent, and they minimize garbage with actual plates and cups. I will definitely return. You should check it out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Delivery person was rude and a liar!  We ordered a pizza for delivery and when I started wondering why it was taking so long I called.   The young girl that answered was rather rude and stated she was at our house and knocked and rang the doorbell... lies.  I was sitting at the table not 3 feet from the door from the time I ordered the pizza until the time I called back.  She then snottily said she would redeliver it.... cold.  Totally rude when she arrived and not a single apology.  NEVER ORDERING ANOTHER PIZZA FROM HERE!!!  Too bad really... I love their pizza.  Please hire decent staff and train them how to treat customers."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and calzones here.  Although it is a little pricy, it is very good.  I ordered takeout a few weeks ago and when I arrived to pick it up my order wasn't quite ready.  The staff was very professional and courteous.  Additionally, they threw in an order of breadsticks due to the time I had to wait which was a complete surprise, but much appreciated."}
{"text":"There is good pizza and there is amazing pizza. Then there is Dougboys which takes both categories and combines them into something that is beyond explanation. 

The cheese pizza is to die for. Gooey and cheese and melt in your mouth amazingness. If you decide to add toppings be prepared for an avalanche of toppings that will leave you stuffed after only two slices.

The breadsticks are equal in glory to the pizza in terms of deliciousness and crispness. I can't say enough wonderful things about Doughboy's. It's definitely worth trying out and then becoming a regular customer."}
{"text":"Truly one of the worst pizza deliveries I've had in a while. After spending $45, a frozen Tombstone pizza would have been a the same quality. The food was cold, the fish pieces actually dropped with grease, the cheese on the pizza wasn't even melted, not to mention food was missing from the delivery. 

Do yourself a favor and skip Doughboys Pizza."}
{"text":"As the title states it's all about the dough. Came on a weekend when slices weren't available, but hostrecommended a chicken bacon ranch pizza that was to die for. Served in squares like a childhood favorite, good size portions of chicken and bacon to boot. Came from Madison and will definitely be back. Prices are great service is extremely friendly and food is delicious."}
{"text":"I have been to Doughboy's a number of times over the last few years.  It's a great place to go with friends to have a drink and watch some of the game or to sit down and have a nice meal.  The layout works well with the bar and seating on one side and then the sit-down dining tables on the other side.

Friendly service and awesome pizza.  Whoever is cooking those pizzas in the back is definitely putting in the effort to make sure everything that comes out of the kitchen is cooked to perfection.

My favorite pizza is the Angry Rooster that comes with chicken, jalapenos, hot sauce, and ranch.  Definitely a solid combination.

I would recommend this locally owned establishment to anyone!"}
{"text":"We had doughboys for The first time tonight. And I sincerely hope that they thrive in Cottage grove. The sausage and pepperoni cheese pizza we had for dinner was amazing.  I ate way too much-especially when coupled with the delicious bread sticks.  The dipping sauce was just ok-but believe me you won't need it. Looking forward to the next pizza night!"}
{"text":"Doughboys recently upgraded their online presence by using Eat Street to manage online orders.  Great enhancement for this terrific local restaurant.  Awesome pizza and appetizers."}
{"text":"I have always given this place five stars but can't this time. Twice now our pizzas have been sub par. The sauce was salty and one of the pizzas had all of the ingredient sort of thrown in the middle with no love on how it was made. The crust was thicker on the last one and did not taste at all like the usual pizzas we have been getting here since it opened. One of the owners told me nothing had changed on the making of them but we disagree. They were average at best and not at all like the previous thirty or forty pizzas we have ordered here in the past. I will give them a return visit at some point in the future but not anytime soon. There are lots of other choices out there and we need to try some of them."}
{"text":"We had a few coupons to use for this pizza joint. I had heard great things and others have had really good pizza. I ordered online for a 20 inch pizza with a few different toppings for my family and I. It said it would be ready in about 30 minutes so we went and picked it up. We had a coupon for a free 2 liter soda as well as a discount of the pizza. The restaurant was very big and it wasn't too packed. We were helped right away and the pizza was ready to go. It was really good pizza and all the correct toppings were on it which was great. Everyone loved it and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's a shame that this place isn't as popular as it should. I got two individual slices. The pizza is awesome, thin wide slices, super-crispy/light crust, great sauce, good toppings. The breadsticks are mind-blowing, crisp and light without being dry, like their pizza crust. Prices are on par and staff is highly customer-oriented."}
{"text":"I am updating my original review as I stopped in for lunch today and ordered two slices of the Deluxe  (pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, mushrooms, and onions) for a sweet, 2-slice Lunch Special of $5.65...and I've gotta say, this pizza was FABULOUS!! Again, the thin, crispy crust is amazing and the slices arrived piping hot and the flavor was spot-on, baked to perfection! I spoke with the awesome owner, Alex, and he confirmed that his ingredients are fresh weekly, not canned, and the meat toppings are locally sourced! BOOYAH! As noted in other reivews, these folks also deliver, YAY for the far East Side of Madison!! I'm thrilled to have made it back to this little gem and look forward to stopping in again soon to try the Angry Rooster!!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy the food at Doughboys. The pizza is very good as are the fish, tenders, and wings. The spicy cheese bread is also very good. It is one of the few delivery places in town, and delivery is fast. It be nice if they would offer some salads on their menu for delivery, but no complaints with the food they do offer."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. However not a lot of options for the buffet. Service was just ok."}
{"text":"Doughboys is really good. The pizza is a cracker thin crust. The salad bar is nice. They also have a bar section with TVs."}
{"text":"I went for their lunch buffet. Thin crust pizza cut into squares with a solid salad bar. The pizza was fresh and tasty; there were plenty of options. Definitely a local operation, if that's important to you. I'm easy to please with pizza, all I need is a nice cheese thin crust pizza and an unsweetened ice tea and I am the happiest man-rabbit hybrid on the planet."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed last night (9/20/16 at 8:00pm).  Normally DB has good service and excellent pizza, which is why our experience last night was so frustrating and unexpected. Server was good, but uninformed...didn't get the order right and had to come back multiple times to clarify information she had written down. Took 1hr to get first appetizer, then our pizzas (3 total) came every 10-15 minutes after that. Totally spaced out way too far to make for a reasonable dinner. Gluten free pizza was burned, so it was returned to kitchen to be remade. Upon waiting another 20 minutes, the sever came and said \"sorry, the cook just got a huge to-go order and we're not able to make your replacement pizza.\"  What?!  I attempted to go talk to the cook, thinking it would be a manager type person...found him speaking with the bartender at the bar (so much for being busy with that to-go order)...when I asked him \"what's up tonight? Service speed and accuracy is lacking\" he murmured something and scurried back into the kitchen while laughing. What?!

Tuesday night. Three employees total. Maybe 10 people (three groups) in the restaurant. Not that busy. 

Unacceptable. Must do better DB. Will go elsewhere next time for sure. :("}
{"text":"Great place to have a drink and go out with his friends. unexpensive, quiet, lots of TVs. It took about 20 minutes to get pizza but it was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday to eat with my family. Not much for seating, but there is the option to eat in even though it is obviously more of a takeout/delivery place. My father and I shared a 16 inch deluxe along with a spicy cheesy bread app. The cheesy bread was phenomenal: lots of gooey cheese along with thick, crispy bread. The deluxe was pretty good as well: very thin crust with lots of flavorful toppings. Perfect place to get pizza if you like lighter,thinner pizza. Definitely recommend the cheesy bread though."}
{"text":"A welcomed pizza place to Cottage Grove!   Love the thin crust; not a fan of the hand tossed.  The pizza sauce is the best!"}
{"text":"Ordered a 14\" pizza for delivery and got a smaller pizza that measured only 13\" ... hmmmm - when i opened the box thought maybe they sent a 12\" by mistake but apparently not.  Felt we didn't get what we ordered. Ate in the restaurant once and service was very slow and inattentive taking well over half an hour to get a medium pizza tho not particularly busy night. Salad bar was iceberg lettuce with a selection of raw pizza toppings."}
{"text":"A better local option than Pizza Hut to feed the kids, but not a culinary destination.

I struggled a little with the star rating.  I ended up giving it two stars since the \"Meh, I've experienced better\" is a closer representation of my opinion than the three star \"A-OK\".  If my kids were rating the pizza, it probably be closer to a 3 star rating.   I primarily use Doughboys as a cost-effective option to feed the kids on those nights where I don't have the time to prepare a home cooked meal.  

There are not multiple crust options to choose from when ordering.  On a 1 to 10 scale where 1 is crispy and 10 is bubble gum chewy, I'd give Doughboys a 6.  The crust does not detract from the pizza, but is nothing memorable either.

Doughboys does offer a number of sauce options (marinara, alfredo, olive oil, ranch and BBQ).  The marinara sauce tastes like you standard out of the can red sauce - OK for the kids, but not destination dining.

There are 22 different options for toppings.  The feta cheese option is appreciated and often utilized.  Topping quantities are adequate.  There are not any gourmet options for toppings, but the standards they offer are adequate for the kids.

The appetizer menu offers 16 options, primarily the deep fried options you would see at your local drinking estabishment (fries, cheese curds, onion rings, jalapeno poppers).  The breadsticks are popular with the kids and are reasonably priced.

I can not comment on the dinner menu (primarily chicken and fried shrimp options) since I have not ordered any of them.

Service for my takeout orders has always been prompt and friendly.  For carryout orders, the food is always ready on time.

In summary, I'm glad to have a locally owned pizza option to feed the kids.  It's kind of like the pizza version of McDonald's.  Not much in the way of creativity, but they offer a consistent product.  Until they step up their game, I'll continue to head into Madison (Greenbush Bar, Ian's) to get my pizza fix."}
{"text":"I've had Doughboys on several occasions and they have not disappointed.  They have a great combination of cheese, sauce and toppings that just taste right.  

We noticed they were going to be open Christmas Eve and booked our family get-together there.  Sometimes it's easier to do that than prepare something at home.  Nine of us rolled in - it was pretty quiet outside of us.  In fact, we were able to request pizzas for the buffet they had.  It worked out well.  Good breadsticks - tasty and fresh.  The pizzas were good as usual.  There were a few of us that really wanted to try the Mac N' Cheese pizza, so we went for it.  That was very good as well.  The salad bar had a nice array of toppings - I like to go with some ham cubes and boiled eggs - that could be a meal itself.  

The kids (and some of adults - I'll admit it) went to the back to play some video games.  It's a nice distraction if you have to wait for food.

The service was excellent - I'm sure in part because we were fairly alone.  But, service with a smile was standard.

The Waunakee location is nice for meeting up with family (consisting of west and east side locations).  The place is clean and, like I said, the food tastes good."}
{"text":"I go here often for lunch because their buffet is outstanding for the price.  The pizza is good (some of the better pizza in the area), and for less than $10 you get all-you-can-eat and a drink.  Can't complain.

That being said, the downside is that they bring out four large pizzas to their buffet at a time and don't replace them as often as they should unless it's really busy.  I've shown up before and had to pick my meal from the four that were under the lamps for my whole visit.  

Occasionally, I've been there when it's busy and the pizza got completely decimated.  I ended up sitting around for 5 or 10 minutes until they bring out another and during a lunch buffet on a weekday, that's downright unacceptable.  I always bring a book when I come here.  You might need it.

The service is great, though.  It's a really nice location and store."}
{"text":"For an independent, this is a pretty solid lunch buffet overall. I am a big thin crust person, and their thin crust on the buffet is excellent - fairly light but with enough carbon on the bottom for that cracker like flavor. Their sausage is good, so my usual supreme/deluxe is excellent here. Their sauce is relatively sweet, which I prefer.

They take requests for the buffet if you ask when you arrive, and the only reason they don't get five stars is that the selection can be limited if you get there after 1230pm.

The salad bar is very good, and they have at least one soup available most of the time. The breadsticks are tasty as well, even if they are just a standard food distributor stick you can find at Dahmen's and other indie pizza places."}
{"text":"Good pizza and appetizers. No complaints about the food or service.

Only complaint is that they are a bit pricey, and have been stingy on giving out coupons on top of the pizza boxes lately. Sorry guys, but the \"buy 10 pizzas, get a 12 inch 2 topping free\" slips are a lame coupon. I'm not going to bother dedicating a slip storage space somewhere in my house just for your business.

If they had a decent deal like 2 14\"pizzas for $20 or something, I'd order a lot more often. Right now a 20 inch with only a few toppings will set you back almost $30."}
