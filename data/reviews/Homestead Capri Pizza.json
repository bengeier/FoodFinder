{"text":"I never even made it inside! After pulling into the parking lot and getting out of my car I was \"greeted\" by a HUGE bouncer who wanted to search me. If a pizza place needs a bouncer then it is NOT the kind of place I want to eat at. Must draw a dangerous crowd or something."}
{"text":"A vehicle with the doors, truck opened, music playing, backed up to the front door was my first indication that I was is in the wrong place.  The bouncer was pleasant, however he wanted to search me prior to entering.  I said no and turned around and left.  You may want to consider having the pizza delivered."}
{"text":"I called on Saturday around 6:30pm to order hot wings & an appetizer. I gave my address & they said it would take about 40 minutes. An hour and a half passed and I called back to find out where my order was. The girl on the phone said that the delivery guys were all out and that if I didn't get anything in 10 minutes to call back. After about 20 minutes I called back now about 2 hours since I ordered and still no food. The girl on the phone transferred me to someone else to figure it out. They said they called me to say that the appetizer I ordered was out and the person that answered the phone said they didn't order anything. After trying to explain that I had never received a call we realized that because I live in an apartment the phone number with my address was someone that previously lived there. I would assume that if when they called and the person said they didn't order they would've realized this and tried to get back in contact with me. 

So I gave them my correct phone number and the employee was going to call me back about what to do. When I received a call back they were going to give me another appetizer instead.. at this point it had been over 2 hours and 3 phone calls later and they weren't even offering to comp my meal. At this point I just told them to cancel the order completely. The employees and management were not accommodating at all and overall I was extremely disappointed with the customer service."}
{"text":"I have lived in Homestead and been a patron of this business for many years and I am so disappointed. I ordered on a Friday night 04/21/2017 at 7:20 pm a small cheese pizza, 20 wings, and fries. By 8:45 pm we had still not gotten the order so I called again at which time they stated \"It's leaving now.\" By 9:45 pm it had still not come so I called again it sounded like the same person I spoke to before and he then stated \"The pizza is coming out now.\" I then cancelled the order. I called back and asked to speak to a manager and the same person who answered before told me he was a manager and his name was Dre Johnson. I asked why it was acceptable to have an order take that long and his response was \"We only have one driver.\" I asked why that was on a Friday night and he stated \"Exactly it's Friday and it's busy and we only have one driver!\" as if I am to blame for you being short staffed and having poor planning? I asked him for the owner's name and who was his boss and he said Chris and hung up on me, but I'm guessing Chris must be his actual manager because I did not see his name listed as an owner. In my 25 years of experience with customers it is never okay to be combative when you are in the wrong. The appropriate response should have been to apologize first and even try and make amends by offering a discount or a freebie. The freebies and discounts are not the point here either, I just felt totally disrespected by his actions and feel they need to retrain their staff. I will tell anyone who will listen not to patronize this establishment anymore, it was so much better when Mario owned it. 

Terribly Disappointed"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the staff is wonderful! Once I had to send a dish back because the new person taking my order got it wrong and the manager was so great about correcting the situation! I'll order here above any place else in my area!"}
{"text":"I've never posted a yelp review before.  This meal was so horrible that I downloaded the yelp app just so I could warn others to stay away!  We ordered food from Capri since we were going to voodoo brewery.  We ordered a cheesesteak with no mayo and an Italian calzone since the person working there talked up the calzones.  We ended up with a cheesesteak heavy on the mayo and an Italian wedgie, which was just a folded up pizza full of mayo and onions.  No sign of Italian meat to be found.  No marinara sauce.  It was inedible.  We ended up walking to kfc instead.  

I want to leave a zero star rating, but yelp won't let me.  So they get an undeserved star."}
{"text":"I judge a pizza joint by their cheese pizza and their pepperoni.  While grabbing a brew at Voodoo, my friends and I were feeling a bit hungry.  Thankfully a menu was available and Capri pizza was just across the street. 

We ordered a small cheese pizza to pick up.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The cheese was not greasy, the sauce was flavorful, and the dough was chewy yet crunchy... what more could you ask for?  We were really impressed with the quality cheesy pizza from Capri.

Next time we'll try the pepperoni and post an update.  I see yummy pizza in our future.  If you're grabbing a pint a Voodoo and feel a rumbly in your tumbly, order something cheesy at Capri Pizza in Homestead."}
