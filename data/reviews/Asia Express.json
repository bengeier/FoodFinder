{"text":"I have been here several times for take out. I always have had a good meal. Always hot and just the way I order it. The staff is really nice. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place. Whether dining in, grabbing take out or having it delivered, every experience I've had at Asia Express has always been a gut bustingly positive one! 

Friendly, exuberant staff and a deliciously wide variety of dishes that makes every visit intensely flavorful and unique. Service is always quick, and the food is just fantastic. Fresh and generous portions, you definitely get what you pay for! I've been to a lot of AYCE restaurants, but having discovered this place, I will happily return again and again."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Asian restaurant in the Madison area. The restaurant is small but don't let that fool you. The food is GREAT!!! We have gone three times and each time we try different things. We have loved it each and every time. I'm picky, but at Asia Express I'm confident that the food I order is going to be great. From garlic chicken to beef and broccoli. I can't say enough good things about this place. Now go and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"This AYCE sushi joint is a hidden gem! Some of our local favourites haven't been up to par lately with their quality and service, so we decided to try this place out again since the last time we went when they were fairly new. 

We went for the weekend dinner which is $21.99 and includes soft drinks. There is a large selection to choose from which includes not only the regular AYCE sushi options, but also Thai and Chinese dishes. You could easily bring a sushi hater here and they would find a ton of food to eat. 

The food was fresh and full of flavour. No fishy fish here. All of the spicy roll options actually had a decent kick to them unlike most places. Short ribs were tender and not chewy. The crab and cheese wontons were rich, but delicious! 

The service was friendly and attentive. The decor is modern without feeling cold.

We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"great take-out--inside has no atmosphere, very clean, for loners who don't want table service and don't mind eating with plastic utensils on styrofoam-ick.  Owners are friendly--and give efficient service.  Be careful with hours.  Weekday afternoon \"break\" from 2-4 PM often extends until 4:15--have not always waited--just gone elsewhere. Vietnamese specials also made by request only."}
{"text":"We used to come here frequently, less so recently, but still once every couple of months. The service is declining rapidly. The food is still okay, not stellar. Best thing on the menu is the garlic steak! 
They seem to have gotten militant with the plate removal, to the point where they hover, and a couple of times have asked us, mid bite, to remove something from another plate so they can take it away. We weren't expecting any more food, so it was not for our convenience, it was for theirs. Maybe they have a plate shortage? They also tried multiple times to clear plates that still had food on them.  When I said we weren't finished, they laughed! 
They also told us at the beginning of the meal, as we were making our selections, not to order to much.
It seems almost everything is extra. Cost extra for bubbles (tapioca) in bubble tea! With the recent price increases, this is becoming a very expensive option, well beyond its worth. 
The service here used to be great, and the prices reasonable, both have shifted in the wrong direction."}
{"text":"WORSE GENERAL TSO CHICKEN AND CRAB RAGOONS EVER!!!!

Not being a Madison native, I was relying on yelp to find a good Chinese fast food to pick up.  With 4 1/2 stars, I figured this was a safe bet, but for the first time ever, I was blindsided by other yelp reviewers.  

Thinking that general tso chicken and crab ragoons were the safe choices for ANY chinese take out, I was wrong. 

The general tso chicken was SO salty I couldn't even swallow it.  I honestly didn't taste ANY general tso, tangy flavoring... it was pure SALT.  The crab ragoons had less than a teaspoon of filling in it and were cooked so crisp, I couldn't even break it. For ~4$, I expected a little more than that. 

 Don't get me wrong... I understand this is a chinese take out and I dont expect 5 star quality food, but it was so bad I had to return it and went to ANOTHER chinese restaurant for food. 

I honestly would have given this a 0 star but they were willing to give me back a refund, which entitled it a 1 star.  The funny thing is when I called back to complain about how salty the food was, she told me that I should have told her not to put as much salt in my food.  Explaining to her how I've never been at the take out, I didn't know I had to specify \"not so much salt\" when ordering a tangy dish... and she continued to argue with me saying that all of her customers like it that way...and those who dont, they know better and would order \"not so much salt\" next time they come back,, so next time, I should order correctly.  

No thanks, I won't be coming back. 

So save your money...save your time..."}
{"text":"Chicken was dry. Sushi wasn't the greatest. Only had deep fried chicken dumplings . No pork. I've had better. Will not return."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking, but it's not just sushi! They have fantastic Thai and Chinese food too. Good food and unbelievable prices? Sign me up! 

This gem was my mom's discovery. She stopped in for some take out and fell in love. Their combos are an amazing value. For around $10, you get more than enough food to fill that tummy.  

Greeting you as you walk in is a big, beautiful fish tank. It brightens up the whole place. The staff are friendly and attentive. You have the option of a la carte or AYCE. I found that other AYCE restaurants didn't openly give you the option of ordering a la carte, you have to ask for that menu. Here, all of the menus are already on the table. 

The sushi is flavourful and fresh. The tempura is light and crispy. The teriyaki dishes are tangy and tender. Calamari and Sweet & Sour Fish are awesome. You need to eat here. I'm not a huge fan of fusion, but they actually do all three very well.  Going to a fusion restaurant where you can safely and happily order anything off the menu is refreshing!  

I've been there more than once since taking these pictures and I will be back for more! 

Their take out menu even has coupons! 

Go and indulge; your wallet will thank you."}
{"text":"We went for lunch, and there were maybe 8 tables occupied, but they seemed completely disorganized and understaffed. The server was very dismissive and snotty. 

We waited almost 15 minutes for drinks and then only after asking how long our order would be after over 30 minutes, we were informed our order was never placed.  We left, but were offered a discount.  When we first asked how long it would be she was dismissive.

We've been many times and the service is consistently sliding.  The food is good, but you have to have hours to spend waiting.  and not mind being snapped at for not leaving your filled out form on the table.

I really hope they turn things around, but am not hopeful."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Never anyone in there and the owner charged me more money for request no onions !!! Wtf!!!! Any didn't even tell me and charged me !!!! Never going back!!!!!!!!! So much  worst lo mein , shrimp is super hard and so much sprouts barely any noodles !"}
{"text":"I little out of the way, but located right by a library, so that's a good thing.  Small, dinerish eating area.  I got the asian mixed greens to go.  I have this weird chinese food curse where everytime I get takeout, the sauce escapes from the container and ends up in the bottom of the bag, but the sauce I had left was delicious, creamy, buttery and garlicky.  The veggies were wonderful and varied, a little bit of tomato and a few pieces of shitake added to the usual vegetables to make a nice treat."}
{"text":"This is now awesome Korean food. It's called New Seoul Korean Restaurant. Yelp needs to update this since there is no mention of Korean restaurant listings in this area when doing a search. 

Very extensive menu. Authentic, delicious and healthy Korean dishes that rank up there with any good Korean food I've come across. Very reasonable prices too. 

I was traveling for business and my hotel was just west of the hwy. I had gone to a nearby coffee shop (also very good) in the morning and just glanced at the sign, putting it on my radar for the evening. Did a nice 8 mile run along the south end of Lake Mendota so was pretty hungry. 

After showering up, got to the restaurant about 8:30, 15 mins before they were scheduled to close. They still attended me no problem. Got the pork bimbimbop and was happy I did. All the ingredients were very fresh and perfectly spiced, without being too spicy. Came with a couple extra side dishes and miso soup. All for under $11. Walked out completely satisfied. If I lived locally, I would definitely frequent this new establishment. You should as well. 

Till next time New Seoul Korean Restaurant. You guys rocked it!"}
{"text":"Honestly, we got sat at one of the crappiest tables in the entire restaurant, and then the entire dining experience just made me progressively more angry. 

The Chinese food quality is pretty decent - better than most restaurants, but is reigned back by the sushi which is pretty crappy quality and selection throughout. 

My party of 3 made one single order from the all you can eat lunch - a pretty reasonable amount of food, nothing excessive by any means (considering one of us was a 4 years old). However, the restaurant felt it was necessary to bring all the Chinese food first, leave all the sushi till last, and then omit half of the sushi from the order. considering the amount of time we had been there, and the crappy experience we were having, we decided to just pay the bill and leave. Maybe its better now, maybe it was a very anal cook or a bad day, but based on my experience, I cannot confidently recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is by far mine and my girlfriends favorite place for sushi and Asian cuisine.  The sushi is so fresh and tasty it tastes like you're eating by sea.  We've tried our fair share of sushi from at least 5 other restaurants in the area and we still feel this is our favorite place to go. The staff have come to recognize us as regulars and are always friendly. There was only once, maybe twice, that the service was slow and the staff seemed a little irritated but the place was packed and understaffed.  Fair prices and tons of Asian cuisine choices! You won't be disappointed with the food, I swear!"}
{"text":"I wanted to rate a 3.5, but since I can't decided to round up. We got take out on a Saturday night. We called at 7:30pm, and were told that they were really busy so it would be about 40minutes. Kinda felt like the girl on the phone was irritated that I was bothering her while she was busy. When we got there, the place was deserted, and our order was waiting for us (The only one on the counter). The cook smiled & waved to us as we entered, and eventually two young girls came out to help us. We had ordered 1 egg roll, but the girl said \"Oh, really? I heard 2\". Nope, just 1. We just looked at each other, as I waited for her to say, ok I will charge you for 1. Never happened. My hubby looked at me and said, well you want 2 anyway, don't you? So finally, I said sure. We paid and got out of there. 

Everything was nice and hot when we got home. Unfortunately, everything is served in styrofoam, even the soups. Boo. Can't recycle styrofoam around here.

The veggie egg rolls were good (BOTH of them. :)). The sweet and sour was a bit too runny and vinegary for my tastes. The hubby enjoyed his hot and sour soup quite a bit. I got the wonton soup - chicken & pork wontons. Really nice, light broth. The noodles are nice and thin, unlike the thick, gummy ones that you usually get at fast food Chinese joints. There was not too much filling in the wontons, which was perfect for me since I'm not much of a meat eater.

I had the shrimp in lobster sauce - I had asked the girl on the phone if there was any pork in it, since that is traditional of lobster sauce. She said, \"Pork?\". Yes, pork. In the lobster sauce. \"Ummm, I don't believe so\". I was skeptical that she knew what she was talking about, but she was right. No pork. Also, no black beans, and no garlic. Not a very traditional dish. Diced carrots, chopped up pea pods and mushrooms with a white sauce with egg mixed in (the only part that was reminiscent of lobster sauce). Tons and tons of shrimp! It was cooked well, the shrimp were perfect, though the sauce was a bit bland for my taste. I added ginger and soy sauce to kick it up a notch.

The hubs got the SIngapore chicken. Another big order with lots of chicken. Good amount of spiciness. Broccoli, carrots, bamboo, mushroom - all were cooked well, nice and crispy. He is undecided if he would recommend it to a friend. 

So in summary, some things were pretty darn good, and some were AOK. The service leaves something to be desired, so I think we'll stick with take out."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience with them,. I ordered LoMein noodles and asked them to make it spicy. When I went to pick the food, I was charged $12, It sounded pretty expensive. I was hesitant to ask what was the normal price. I though I can check that in their menu and also I wanted one menu for my future ordering. I could not find any to-go menu on their counter. I could find few on the other side out of my reach. I requested her if I can have a menu. She rudely said that they don't have as much and can't give one to me. I told her, I will review and return it back t her. She rudely refused and said she can't give it me. I have never experienced anything like this. It was really frustrating. I felt very much discriminating. I am not a citizen of this country and have different country origin which is visibility seen. I assume, if it was someone else, she could have definitely given the  menu. Very upsetting. I ended paying $12+ for one order of noodle. Please be aware to check the price of your order over the phone before heading there. Otherwise you will surprised and end up paying more. This place does not know what customer service is."}
{"text":"Three of us dined.  We had garlic steak,white rice,Cantonese chow mein,spring rolls,gyoza
Garlic steak had a lot of garlic. Beware

There was lots left over and we were all stuffed for 42.00"}
{"text":"Don't do it. Don't go here. My mom and I just got home from lunch when the food poisoning hit. My mom is fine as she didn't eat the sushi. I on the other hand had 4 pieces before I stopped."}
{"text":"The owner is almost always there - if you haven't enjoyed your time - speak with her. As for the food poisoning review on here. That's ridiculous! It takes between 24 and 36 hours depending on the bacteria for food poisoning to occur! So right after lunch and blame then highly unlikely. Be fore you did a business like that have your facts straight."}
{"text":"I can't figure out exactly why all these amazing reviews have been posted for this place. Those reviews are exactly what compelled me to try this place when I was feeling like sushi in Whitby this afternoon. It's not easy to find good sushi and I was looking forward to finding a gem in a city that hasn't lived up to my sushi expectations.

Lunch is well priced, $12.95 per person for AYCE with a good sized menu. Note that any items with flowers are only available for the dinner menu. We ordered a good selection of stuff, including spicy salmon rolls, dynamite rolls, beef pad thai, vegetarian rice paper rolls, spring rolls, wontons, dumplings, sushi and tempura (broccoli and shrimp). 

I ordered a seaweed salad which came first, the portion was too large for me for a starter salad with lunch so I wasn't able to finish it but it was as good as you would get at any other sushi restaurant. Rolls came next with the sushi - sushi was good. The rice paper rolls really piqued my interest but the vegetarian ones were boring. Just vermicelli noodles, cucumber and another veggie, not carrot. Nothing really going on there - disappointing. They could have thrown in some veggies of different colours or something to kick it up a notch. The salmon rolls weren't very good - they did that thing where they chop up all the ends of the sushi and use them in rolls mixed with spicy sauce. Not only do I hate this style of preparation, they weren't very good. Too much rice and no additional sauces on the outside. So these became the type of rolls that, if you don't like sticky rice,  you'll want to gag on. Boring.

The dynamite rolls were much the same, uninspired rolls as the salmon ones and I couldn't finish them. No extra sauce drizzled on top, as is customary with these rolls, very dry and very boring. Tempura shrimp and avocado in a roll need some extra help, more so than soy sauce can give them. The spring rolls were full sized but there  was too much of one particular spice in them. The wontons were great, but you can't go wrong with deep fried wonton wrappers. Almost no filling in them though... don't know why they bothered to fill a teeny tiny portion of whatever it was. May as well just fry them plain,they're good like that. The tempura was okay but nothing special. I didn't eat the beef pad thai but my boyfriend said there was barely any beef in it, but he did eat the entire portion.

Service were was very good - prompt and friendly, our waitress explained the menu to us when we indicated we hadn't been before. Lunch included a soft drink or green tea, which is nice because it helps keep costs down.The restaurant itself is very modern and clean and has a nice atmosphere. But those things can't bring this restaurant back from the boring uninspired food we had today.

Something super important to me in a sushi restaurant is being able to execute sushi well. If you don't eat sushi then sure, you don't care about the quality or taste of it because you get chinese and thai dishes. But you can't offer sushi and have it be boring or poor quality. The sushi here - don't order it. If you like chinese, this may be a place for you but definitely not a place for a sushi eater.

Overall, not worth a second look. Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere for sushi in Whitby. I won't be back, only because so many dishes were so very boring and lacking the extras that you would find elsewhere that everything fell flat."}
{"text":"Came yesterday on a Thursday night hoping I would try some nice tasting food at the Casino Ajax but it was too busy so my friend and I would try here. Drove by a couple of times when we would go to port perry as it was a hidden beside the Sobey's Supermarket.

It was very good and tasting I said I wouldnt order any rice food as those can easily fill you up. It wasn't as busy as I hoped it would be and it was decently priced. They do charge you for pop as it was not included with the AYCE menu. I will try this place once again."}
{"text":"The food was good. Very clean, Comfortable. The only thing that was a real negative was the service was VERY slow, and a little unorganized because of their ordering system. Had to tell the waitress numerous times we were missing things from our order(s). 

The fusion between Japanese's, Thai and Chinese allowed all in the party to order things they like from an Asia menu.. what ever it might be."}
{"text":"This is our favorite take out place.  The food is always fresh, flavorful and plentiful.  The owners are very nice also.  We drive out of the way for take out from them."}
