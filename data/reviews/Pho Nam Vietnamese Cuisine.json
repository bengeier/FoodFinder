{"text":"This is your standard Vietnamese restaurant - which is one of the reasons I like Vietnamese cuisine so much, I have only been to a couple restaurants and been surprised at what I ordered. Which is usually grilled or lemongrass chicken with spring rolls on vermicelli. I've eaten here many times and I am pleased with both the food and service."}
{"text":"On my 3rd and last visit service was so bad I do not think I will return for a long time if ever.  Prices were a little bit expensive and portions smaller compared to other Vietnamese places been to, however location is across the street from my place.  Quality seemed to be a bit better then average, however the service was lacking to say the least on my last 2 visits.  I was going to order desert on my last visit however after waiting over 20 minutes with plates obviously ready to be bused, I decided to pay and get something from the bakery across the street and support that local business.  I consider myself to be a generous tipper, giving something even when really disappointed, however only reason tipped even a dime was one of the cooks took my money and I didn't have any issue with the food (or feel like waiting for my 3.50$ from 20$ as wasted enough of my time).  This review is my only recourse."}
{"text":"The best Pho in town! The place is super clean and very friendly staff. The prices are very reasonable and there is a variety of items to choose from."}
{"text":"The best beef stew in town! The food is always great and the people are amazing!! The beef salad rolls are to die for too!! Make sure you come hungry"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Pho Nam once or twice a month since it opened. We had previously gone to Saigon Gourmet in Lynnwood, which was great until it changed hands in late 2013 and the food and service went down a couple of notches . 
We tried a few other spots until Pho Nam opened a year ago, and have been fans of this restaurant ever since. 
My wife almost always orders the Bun (#43), although she once tried the Wor Wonton, which is not one of their strong points when you compare it to Wonton King just a few minutes away.
I alternate between the Pho (#29, their 'Special' soup) and the #43 Bun, and have always been totally satisfied with the food quality, even though the Pho varies slightly from time to time (IMHO, that's a good thing).
We've never had an issue with service, including one instance when we did take out. Service is extremely prompt, both for order taking and for food serving, and we're not big spenders since we usually have one item each, drink only water, and ask for forks (for the life of me, I'm not great with chopsticks). We dropped in for lunch today, right at noon, and left Pho Nam 30 minutes later (great service!) after two delicious and generous bowls of the #43 Bun.
Pho Nam is highly recommended......let's hope it never changes ownership."}
{"text":"Probably the worst viet I have ever had. Burnt spring rolls. Soggy noodles and the broath in the 21 was grosse. New to the area but will drive out of my way to avoid this place. Yuck. I neglected to mention when I was finished paying the lady who took my order was clipping her finger nails at the till."}
{"text":"Food is OK but the cleanliness of the place is brutal. Tables, floors, chairs and windows in dire need of attention...definitely a \"turn off\"."}
{"text":"First time here and was very impressed by the food and service. 

Portions are large and service is great. 

Ordered the spring rolls and chicken on egg nest for kids and wife and I ordered pork and spring rolls on vermicelli. 

Yummy! Decor is a little dated but overall very clean restaurant. 

Very authentic PHO for south Calgary!"}
{"text":"Love the sate pho here. Friendly service and great CONSISTENT pho."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, desultory service.

Bun Bo Hue had a bland tomatoey broth and was filled with what I could swear were overcooked spagetti noodles. A fair bit of meat to the serving, but most of it had been cooked to the point of flavorless - the beef balls being the exception.

Deep-fried prawns were the frozen kind, served with bottled chinese plum sauce  (not the creamy dip shown in the menu)."}
{"text":"Moving into the neighborhood from Bankview, we were intially skeptical about our nearby food options. 
Having a reliable Vietnamese joint is something we had come to depend on and we are so happy Pho Nam has become our go to.

They make our favourite spicy chicken sate soup, the spring rolls are crispy and the interior of the restaurant is clean and pleasant. 
They also do subs for takeout (and they are great) plus you get a free pop all for 8 bucks!
For the vegetarians out there, they make a delicious rice noodle pho.

The only tricky bit is they close at 9, so if we want after sport eating we have to be creative with calling for pick-up."}
