{"text":"Salads and sandwiches are made to order, fresh and very good.  Service can be a bit slow for a \"fast food\" because of all the choices they have, but for me it's worth the wait. 

I feel it's an healthier and fresher alternative to sandwich/subs chains."}

{"text":"Pros

- It's nice to have a place that focuses on gourmet salads, particularly one where you can have a wide variety of options to choose from to make your own ideal salad.

- I like how the place looks, it's very modern with a huge counter to order from. Plenty of fresh selections and the line runs pretty quickly. Seating is nice.

Cons 

- I've eaten here twice and both times the salads were only \"OK\". First time I went with a Caesar's salad and the dressing was a bit sparse and more importantly, the vinaigrette just didn't do justice! Very weak. The 2nd time I went with a custom Asian salad and the lady who seemed to be having a bad day prepared my salad by simply bathed it with dressing to the point ALL I TASTED WAS DRESSING.

- A big custom salad can set you back about $13-15. That's a hard sell if the salad isn't awesome.

All in all, very average experience. I'll go back and try out something else and hope for the best."}
{"text":"Salad sensations is a place some people from the office like coming here because it's fresh and healthy. I've eaten here a bunch of times and honestly I'm not a fan of the place. I'm all for healthy food however I find their sandwiches uninspiring and bland. Sure they have lots of options but I don't really find them very flavorful.  Maybe because they are too damm healthy they don't taste as good to me. The last time I was here I ended up using copious amounts of sriracha just to give some more flavour. The last time I was here I had their le frais sandwich. I've also had their l'hyperactive soup. Again it was okay but I find the flavour lacking zest. Maybe because we use lots of bold seasoning in our household. When friends from the office mention to come here I cringe like taking a bite into a sour lemon. You may enjoy this place but I concur it's bland rabbit food for me!"}
{"text":"The food is great but the customer service is horrible. After having brought price errors on their menu to their attention, I was basically told to live with the service that I had received.  The manager is rude and arrogant and did not admit to her mistakes or choose to correct them in a professional manner. Because she was too busy to deal with me over the phone she hung up on my face. 

The Franchise owner Yvon Coupal was made aware of this issue and he was no better. Again I was told that I should live with the service that I had received and told to understand that the manager's attitude was caused by a surplus of customers. 

There are many other restaurants that offer healthy meals at more affordable prices with much better customer service. Spend your money where the employees respect you instead!"}
