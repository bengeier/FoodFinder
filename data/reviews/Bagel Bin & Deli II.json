{"text":"I love this place!!! I am from NY and my fav food is a bagel. I have taken a drive to try  a couple of bagel places but this one is my spot. It happens to be close for me too. I mainly get a bagel but I have also tried lunch items. i am always satisfied with the food. Service is slow at times but that's cause there is only one toaster. I do agree with the guy who said get a pan and stove. I actually love how the eggs are in the micro but i know i'm alone in that.lol"}
{"text":"Best bagels in south charlotte by far. Taylor ham egg and cheese on everything bagel with salt pepper ketchup is fantastic. Can be a little busy / long wait at times but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Guys. Need better service. Great food but it takes way too long. Need to get organized, everyone is standing around the dang toaster and microwave waiting. And please brew some decaf once in a while. Thanks"}
{"text":"I've gotten bagels here a few times being that it is close to my house and there aren't any other non-chain bagel shops around.  Unfortunately, I haven't been impressed.  The bagels themselves are so-so, and only slightly better than most chains, but nothing like I expect from guys from the NY area.  The real thing that put me over the top was the last time I went.  I asked for a sandwich that included a fried egg on my bagel.  I was told that they only have scrambled or they microwave the egg.  To say I was extremely disappointed in a bagel shop that uses a microwave and advertises itself as being from the NY area is an understatement.  Get a flat top and fry up some bacon and eggs.  Too bad the NY Bagel Shoppe that opened in Blakeney could not get its act together.  The food was actually good there."}
{"text":"Amazing bagels but egg sandwiches are weak. I was so happy to find this place. I'm a newly transplant from Long Island. If you're from LI you know we have the best bagels... Better than NYC! So when I heard this family was from LI I knew I had to go. The bagels here were great they were 5 stars FOR THIS AREA. Still nothing like a bagel from back home but definitely the best you can get in NC! I swear it's something in NY water that just makes the bagels. 

The egg sandwiches on the other hand was disappointing. Why why why microwave eggs when it takes two minutes to fry an egg on a griddle! I will never understand why places do this! I've never seen a place do this before moving here. 

Overall, this is our go to bagel place! Highly suggest!"}
{"text":"If you want a good fresh bagel and a made to order sandwich this is the place. Always fresh and a pleasant staff. Just wished they had made to order eggs - not scrambled and microwaved."}
{"text":"Best bagels out there. I'm from NJ, and bagels have always been a big part of my food life. The bagels here are at least as good as the places I used to eat at back home in NY and NJ."}
{"text":"The Taylor ham egg and cheese salt pepper ketchup is a must try bagel sandwich.  Very close to the original from up north. The best I've had in over 6 years."}
{"text":"As a NY transplant, I can definitely say that this place is the real deal!  The bagels tasted just like home and were served with very friendly service (from Long Island natives!) at very fair prices.  My everything bagel with regular cream cheese for $1.99 was absolutely fantastic and was exactly what my homesick taste buds were craving.  Giving it just 4 stars instead of 5 since the bagels were a bit on the dense side (where I prefer them a bit doughy-ier) and I'd like to hold out on the 5th star until I've tasted more of their extensive menu (Boar's Head cold cuts!  Breakfast sandwiches!).  So incredibly relieved I don't have to rely on Panera to get my Charlotte bagel fixes anymore

The 'restaurant' itself is rather small with very basic seating accommodations and no real ambiance to speak of...which didn't matter to me since I got my food to go.  But everything seemed clean and well stocked.  You could also tell that this place has a bit of a local following since I was there during very bad weather at a very off time of the day and yet many tables were taken.

I will definitely be back for more.  Bagel Bin also offers catering options which I might pursue for future events.  Definitely give it a shot!"}
{"text":"We had a party and wanted a six foot hero to add as another option for my guests to eat. I was searching everywhere all that week and couldn't find a place that could make one. Not even a three foot. I just happened To drive past this bagel bin and decided, let me try one more spot. Now this was Friday and my party was the next day. The owner was happy to help and could make me two three footers. The sandwiches were great. (Boarshead) The presentation and condiments were above and beyond. And the customer service was absolutely outstanding. Thank you so much for working so hard. considering the short time frame you had to put it all together, I was very impressed. Continued customer after that."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their bagels and sandwiches remind me of the places I used to go to in NY. The owner is from Long Island so he knows what he's doing. 

All the sandwiches I've had are great. There's a ton of meat and toppings on them so it's worth the price IMO. The bagels are excellent and they have lox too. 

My only complaint is sometimes the line takes forever to go through. Sometimes you barely move for 5 or more minutes. I've seen people get so frustrated that they walk out the door."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! By far the best bagels I've tried so far in the Charlotte area!! Staff is super friendly and the owners are from Long Island!! From around the block where I grew up!!! I will definitely be back!! The honey wheat bagels are my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Excellent bagels!!  Service is always great.  Anytime I go I leave with a dozen bagels, half of which are the Hawaiian (they're delicious).  My kids love the chocolate chip bagels."}
{"text":"It was really busy, but the customer service and attention to detail is lacking. I ordered the featured wrap, ichiban chicken wrap, and the employee wasn't sure which one it was or which meat to use. I also ordered to-go and then she brought it on a tray. I informed her that it was to-go. She sighed as went to wrap it up. She returned, I said thank you, she replied with \"yep\".  I know they were busy, but no need for attitude and all employees should know what the featured meal is. I have been here a few times and the customer service is always hit or miss."}
{"text":"Legit NY ....Long Island to be exact...Bagel shop! The fact that you have in my opinion the best NY style pizza in Lorenzo's in the same strip as this place makes me never want to move. Great fresh bagels, veggie cream cheese, lox, capers....they have it all. Egg bagels are amazing...this place is by far better than Brooklyn water bagel which are more expensive and mass produced. If it miss a good old LI bagel shop come here for a little taste of home"}
{"text":"Bagels taste day-old.  Service is slow and disorganized.  They seem annoyed when you place your order.  I have been craving bagels so I kept trying and trying Bagel Bin.  I'm so over this place that I'd rather drive out of the neighborhood for a decent bagel.  Giving it 2 stars though because it's not inedible.  There's just much better out there."}
{"text":"Easily the best bagel place in south charlotte. The bagels are delicious. My favorite is the everything. They have a great variety of different spreads and bagels for you to choose from. They also have a great selection of delicious lunch sandwiches. My favorite two are the blt or the Italian. They are generous on the amount of meat they put on their sandwiches. Definitely worth a stop by for a quick lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is great. Best bagels I've come across in S. Charlotte. We come here for breakfast all the time. Service is fast."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and I was hoping to find a good bagel shop in the area. Well, I am glad I took a shot here. I didnt try any sandwiches or stuff like that, I just tried the bagel. I had a bagel toasted with butter. I have to say that the bagel had a nice crust along with a soft inside. I had a salt bagel....... and it didnt skimp on the salt. Maybe even a little too much. I brought some back to the office too, and everyone was happy. It will be my go to bagel spot here in town."}
{"text":"Owner is 22 years removed from Long Island. Bagels are good. But I got an egg sandwich, eggs were microwaved. No thanks. I'd go again for just the bagels tho."}
{"text":"The best bagels in NC hands down! I love this place!!! There everything bagels are my favorite! They put a massive amount of cream cheese on your bagel and it's warm and fresh!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best bagels I've ever had!! The egg everything bagel...is EVERYTHING. So good. Staff is incredibly friendly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best bagels I've ever had in my life EVER and the cream cheese is amazing! I haven't enjoyed bagels from anywhere else since trying Bagel Bin over 3 years ago."}
{"text":"I'm from CT and have tried many bagel places in the area and these are the best. We have been going to bagel bin for years and love their bagels."}
{"text":"It's ok. Shocked at a bagel with close to an inch of ham and two slices of cheese cost over $7. Bagels were bland. They need a bit of flavor.  Best NY bagels are elsewhere. These are better than grocery store though."}
{"text":"This place is alright.  The staff is okay, they get their job done, so that's fine with me.  But it's just that each time I get a bagel it's been on and off.  I'd like to try a new sandwich but I always find myself retreating back to the sausage and cheese on an egg bagel.  That's what seems to have the most flavor to me, but maybe that's my preference. And the microwavable egg, I tried it once and then never again.  However, it's still a good place to just grab a quick bite and maybe chat a bit with friends or colleagues."}
{"text":"I love their bagels and we visit here often for breakfast specially after brooklyn water bagels closed. I am taking away two stars due to some hygeine concerns I noticed while waiting for our bagel orders. I noticed that a staff member was bagging some bagels for pickup orders, slicing bagels on a table that didn't look clean. The table had a bunch of papers, miscellaneous items and a big container that had uncovered bagels sitting on top. Also, the staff was putting bagels on top of a microwave before throwing them in the toaster. We love the bagels here but would like the setup to be cleaner and organized."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Bagel Bin & Deli for as long as I can remember!!!! Definitely the NUMBER ONE bagel place around Charlotte!!! The employees are extremely sweet and I've become close to them! They are very quick but persistent when it comes to getting orders ready... The bagels are huge and delicious!!! The cream cheese has to be the best part along with their bacon egg and cheese bagels... They also have lunch specials and sandwiches!!! All of their deli meat is fresh always!!! YOU MUST TRY IT to believe it!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Bagels, good sandwiches, good deal.  They have a great lunch special for a sandwich bagel, chips and a drink for like $5.99.  They take time to run the bagel through the toaster enough so that it is actually toasted rather than just warm.  They pile on the correct amount of meat in proportion to the amount of bread, which is a delicate line.

Not always the fastest place in the world depending on who's working, but the food ends up making up for it."}
{"text":"It's too bad that the food is decent because the customer service is wretched. We have been going here on and off for the last two years and seems that this place cannot hire competent people. We started calling in our orders because the wait time was so long and the only thing to watch was the lazy staff make jokes with each other. But here is the kicker that sealed the Bagel Bin's fate with us. Today I called in my order. I arrived to pick it up just as it was being finished. A young tall eye-glassed employee maybe with ADD unfolded a paper bag and attempted to catch a fly. He was bored with that so he moved behind the register to play with styrofoam cups. The girl that made my bagels grabbed the bag that this dim-witt was using as a fly-swatter. I spoke up and requested another bag since Harry Pot-stick was catching flies with that one. She apologized but the idiot kid laughed and continued laughing while I walked out. WTF. Done with this joint."}
{"text":"I wanted Bagel Bin to be good--I really did. I live right down the road, and a good bagel place would have been awesome here. Alas, this is not that good bagel place. The bagels are okay, not great, but not bad either. Prices are somewhat expensive, but understandable for this area. Staff is below average, it seems like they just want to get the order done as opposed to interacting with the guests. 
Now that Harris Teeter carries Poppy's Bagels (local and delicious), I will not be returning to Bagel Bin. Oh well..."}
{"text":"Happy to be the first review on Bagel Bin since I've turned a lot of people on to this place.  Its kind of hidden but if you're in Ballantyne its worth the minute or two extra drive to get away from the chains.  

Great bagels that are being baked fresh throughout the day in small batches to keep them fresh.  

The sandwhiches are HUGE they really pile on the meat. They use Boar's Head meat which is delicious if you haven't heard of that brand.  I get the roast beef with the horse radish sauce on an everything bagel everytime I go.  

The people there are great and really take care of you.  Definitely go to this place!"}
{"text":"I do enjoy their coffee and their bagels for breakfast. Went there recently for lunch and decided to try to Reuben. I was a little scared after I saw that it was put in the microwave (the rye bread was nicely toasted though). The sandwich was delicious, but if I got it again, I would ask that the whole thing be toasted and not put in the microwave. I was a little put-off that they even had one! Owner was standoff-ish but the girl who made my sandwich could not have been nicer."}
{"text":"Need a Taylor Ham Egg and Cheese with spk!  Just like you had up North.  Look no further !  Also a great group of people working here."}
{"text":"Best bagels in the south. Period."}
{"text":"Please let the record show that I really wanted to give this place a 5 star rating. Walking distance from my office in a small shopping center, I was encouraged by the snug seating area and smiling face behind the counter. 

They've got a $5.99 lunch deal, so I ordered the Reuben (it was good, but a little thin on the ingredients) but it turned out that was the 1 sandwich not included on the lunch deal (my fault for not looking at the fine print!). The sandwich did come with a pickle spear and it was nice and crunchy! They have a fountain drink area, as well as bottled drinks and a decent chip selection for sides.

The real negative to this place was that the smiling face behind the counter who took my order, made my sandwich and checked me out told some highly inappropriate jokes along the way. :( Nothing like feeling uncomfortable while you're on your lunch break. I understand that with little places people's personalities shine through and it should be part of the appeal, but sexual innuendos and creepy jokes just don't fly with a customer who you've never met and who let you know this was her first time in. 

I'll admit that it really grossed me out so much that I won't ever go back and that's a serious shame since I'm so close to it at least 4 days a week!"}
{"text":"Best egg bagel in town! Service was great, for a moment I felt like I was in NY! NY personality with down south service."}
{"text":"Moved to South Charlotte and missed the Bagel Bin in Huntersville.  Luckily I stumbled upon this one.
Best NY bagels around.  Skip the egg sandwiches as the microwave the eggs.  Everything else is great!"}
{"text":"Still my favorite bagel place. People are nice and funny. Makes me feel like home (NJ). My fav are the salt bagels while the kids like the chocolate chip. The honey wheat are good too. Give the crumb cake a try."}
{"text":"Amazing! Best bagels in town! Great for their breakfast menu whether you're craving and egg and sausage or something sweet, can't go wrong! Only the best for lunch with Boars Head meats and by all means, get the lox and cream cheese with tomatoes, onions, and capers! Then follow it with some of their homemade pastries!"}
{"text":"The bagels here a super duper! I go back & forth between the salmon bagel, & the sausage, egg and cheese bagel. Both are amazing!!!

The people here are so sweet. Us North Carolinians tend to think all \"Yankees\" are grumpy, and rude... This family is proof that, that's not the case. 
Support small businesses, and enjoy your awesome breakfast!"}
{"text":"Just ok .my order of sandwich the bread is little old.their are busy and  maybe not enough people working. Good menu with Boars head deli meat and seat area.  Inside and out"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast spot in ballantyne. Haven't had their lunch but if it's anything like their bagels and morning sandwiches then it must be amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Breakfast bagel sandwiches are a great choice.  I get the Hawaiian bagel with egg, cheese, sliced pastrami turkey, & tomatoes.  My husband loves that Hawaiian bagel too...we can't find it anywhere else.  You can't go wrong with any sandwich combo.  It is a weekly trip for us here on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Love the bagels and I have never had problems with the service.  Worth the money!"}
{"text":"It's our go to Sunday treat - everything bagels with jalapeño cream cheese. They are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in charlotte. Bar none. The coffee is fantastic (except the pumpkin spice). The service was slow but a year ago they turned that around. You can get in and out pretty quickly now. I recommend the bacon egg and cheese on an egg everything."}
{"text":"After a few recent visits, Bagel Bin has allowed me to enjoy a nice sandwich, with Boars's Head deli meat, but has not met my New York Bagel craving. Although the bagels are good, they are not great. The service is spotty, due to a young crew working behind the counter. However, today it appeared the Manager/Owner was working the counter and everything seemed to run a little smoother than my past visits. The interior is pretty simple and only offers about five tables, however, does have a lot of tables outside, when the weather finally warms up.
Overall, I've enjoyed my sandwiches, but they can up the service and consistency."}
{"text":"I've had the bagels, some BH meats & their chicken salad.  So far so good.  Another time just a few bagels to go & was in & out of the place in a few minutes like it should be.  This place is a bit out of the way, but it's faster to go here than the other place since they are quicker here."}
{"text":"Delicious bagels!!!!!  We get bagels every Sunday morning. ...a tradition in our house!  Bagel bin is yummy!   Owners and workers are friendly and welcoming.   Their sandwiches are delicious too!  If you want a great east coast bagel give it a try."}
{"text":"Great ny style bagel and feel. Great Hawaiian! If you are looking for an authentic fresh made bagel, this is your place. Fresh cut meats and daily made bagels"}
