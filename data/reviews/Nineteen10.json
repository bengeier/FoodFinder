{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place as it is just about the only restuarant in Kent that we haven't yet been to. The salmon that i had was way overcooked, the ravioli dish my wife had was tasty, but smothered in an over abundance of sauce. Salads were fresh, cocktails seem reasonable, but overall very sub-par. Also just not much of an inviting atmosphere or uniqueness to the place . Just too many other MUCH nicer places in Kent to eat at. Skip this one unless maybe you're actually staying at the hotel & don't feel like venturing out."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant hoping for the best. We were very disappointed. Even though it was Friday evening, we were the only ones in the dining area. There were a few people at the bar. I ordered an $8.00 glass of red wine. It came in a cheap, white wine glass. A lady at the bar had white wine in a nice, (typical) red wine glass so I asked why mine wasn't. Apparently, the lady at the bar had the only one available. They did, however, find another, brought me a new glass of wine, and took away the other one (that I had had a few sips from). We ordered tenderloin medallions (cooked medium) for dinner. Mine was more like medium-well and my husband's well done. I'm not even sure they were tenderloins. They seemed more like sirloin. The sauteed mushrooms were from a jar. My asparagus was good. My husband's potatoes were fine. Our waitress was nice and I can't complain about the service. However, I doubt we will ever go back."}
{"text":"Very nice location inside the Kent State Hotel and Conference Center.
Good service and attentive staff.
I was pleasantly surprised at the menu offerings. The quality, portions and presentation of the meals were excellent.
Very nice meal without breaking the bank.
Loved their wings with garlic sauce, great flavor, cooked just how I like them!
Their version of a club sandwich was very tasty indeed."}
{"text":"Stopped into the restaurant 1910, part of the Kent State conference hotel, on a Tuesday evening, we had great meal and affordable, tasty wine. Appetizers were half off! Glasses of house wine were four dollars. Chicken breast entree was moist and flavorful! We will return."}
{"text":"Great dinner here.  I ordered the tenderloin medallions.  They came with a Caesar salad, seasonal vegetable, and twice-baked au gratin potatoes.  Everything was very tasty and was very plentiful.  I couldn't believe the amount of food I got for the price.  I was very happy with it.  Plus, there was a HUGE nine-TV setup made into one large TV.  What a great place this would be for watching a sporting event.  Charlie, the bar tender, was very nice and attentive to my needs.  I'm happy with my selection and I want to return again soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go out to dinner in Kent every Friday night.  Tonight we tried Nineteen10 for the first time. The food was absolutely delicious. I was so impressed!  It was the best meal I have had in a while. We will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"This is a college town. It's quiet now as school is out. Great ambiance this season. Not crazy like other college towns lol!!! We are staying in the Kent State hotel and this lovely restaurant is in the lobby. Nice people. Good food. They provide the room service too!!"}
{"text":"Ordered room service. The Food was mediocre and sent up in styrofoam and tin foil. No plates, no condiments. No salt and pepper shakers. In a word, lame."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for lunch and we were surprised at how empty the place was.

For being a restaurant that's in the lobby of a hotel/conference center I thought it looked very chic. The food was excellent, fair prices, and the service was superb. My only complaint is that their lunch menu is rather small.

I will definitely be back to try their dinner menu."}
