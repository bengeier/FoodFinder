{"text":"The service was awful when they first opened up but now it is much better. Quality of the food is as good as their other location. Kababs are so good and the price is ok."}
{"text":"I really loved the food and convenience of their location. However, despite the servings being generous, the price seems pretty high...the price is the reason why I took 1 star away. For a skewer, rice, and tomato...the cheapest being 9.99 and it contains lamb which I don't eat. I found the options not very customizable. I also wished they had daily specials or something. They mention you get bread with your meal I think...which I never got (which I can see you can get even with rice from the pics here)   Love the food and will definitely be back. The service could also be a bit more welcoming. Overall, very delicious food but def not a place I can eat often at since the price point seems higher than what I'm used to from similar restaurants."}
{"text":"The best takeout in the neighborhood. The burger is awesome. Never seen such a big burger anywhere, with best quality. The Persian kebab is awesome too. It is a large portion which is more than enough for two.  Quality is great. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Conditional Pass as of March 2.2017  operator failed to provide hand washing supplies."}
{"text":"Went here because I didn't want to go to ikea hungry  and what an amazing idea the meat was juicy tender and tasted amazing great local find. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating there.  Went in on a Tuesday afternoon at 12:40pm, didn't get my meal until 1:28!!  This is supposed to be an express place, ridiculous!  They had a bunch of telephone orders before mine, and some guy who ordered a burger after me got his meal done within minutes and left 15 mins before I saw my meal.  Meanwhile I sat there like a ass waiting for my meal and ended up late for work.  Not even a simple sorry from the lady owner, even after I showed my displeasure.    The chicken leg kebab was partially undercooked on the inside as well (thicker pieces).  Plus the sweaty owner is wiping his head and neck with a towel while cooking over the grill and then right back to the grill without washing his hands.    Food wise, it is just ok but prices are a bit steep.  Seems like the only way you get decent service is if you call ahead and pre-order.  Otherwise if you're in a bit of a rush and plan to drop in for a quick bite to eat, forget about it."}
{"text":"I love this place. Anytime we are in Toronto we come here at least a few times over the length of our stay. The food quality, freshness and quantity is great. We always have enough left over for another big meal. When a food business over exceeds a New Yorker's expectation it must be a great place. :)"}
{"text":"Go here, get koobideh and barg kabobs. Koobideh is ground, spiced beef and barg is like steak / carne asada. The best koobideh and barg consistently I've ever had in my entire life as Persian person and food lover, especially at their low price points. I would recommend washing down with fresh, not carbonated, yogurt drink with mint. They also have good yogurt + cucumber side and eggplant side. If you like rice, get rice with your kabobs.  The staff is also very nice!"}
{"text":"Kabab quality is much lower comparing to the Shater Abbas on yonge. Same business, but very different qualities."}
{"text":"Good food huge quantities and very affordable prices.  The place itself is small with few seats but then again it's an express take out store. All of their items on the meny are delicious and the quantities are in matched, whether you get the plates or the pita raps, very few places provide these quantities.  Even the fries are delicious, almost like their grilled so they have a different flavour.  Very solid place."}
{"text":"This is the most horrendus...ridiculously managed take out ever. They are a disgrace to Iranian community! Time has bo meaning for them...it happened ten times that they have forgot out order and gave us such an attitude that no sotuner sevice approves...if it wasnt about the distance ww would have atopped foing there lobg time ago...it will happen either way"}
{"text":"Tried this through a takeout that my friend ordered and we split the cost. I would say the portions are quite generous and filling. For the price point charged, it's pretty worth the cost. In terms of the quality of food, it was just OK. A bit oily/bland for my liking, but not bad. Good as a grab and go!"}
{"text":"Kabobs are decent but sandwiches are not...recently had their pulled chicken sandwich and was really disappointed...the bun was stale and dressing was disastrous...so if in there, stick to their Persian dishes"}
{"text":"They've increased all prices by almost 30%.  Comparable proper Iranian restaurants charge the exact price for a proper sit down experience.  This place charges the same price for a restaurant that's freezing cold due to door constantly opening/closing resulting in cold food. People behind you constantly bump into you.  Terrible experience; please refer to photos for recent price increases.  It used to be a decent place, but like every other Iranian restaurant, they became greedy."}
{"text":"The location, seating, price and quality of the food was good for an express Iranian restaurant. The food took a little bit longer but it was a fresh batch of food and was delicious. Khalie khosmase"}
{"text":"Surprisingly one of the best persian restaurants  in the area. The food is great and fresh. Generous  portions. They use good quality meat."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the Bayview and Sheppard area. This store replaced Burger Hut, which had been there as long as I can remember.  Shatter Abbas Express serves Persian style BBQ skewers, as well as various stews and dips. They also have a few burgers/hot dogs/sandwiches for those who want that kind of thing.  It's very clean inside, and there are a few tables that seat about four people each. You go up to the counter and order, and then they make your food. Skewers are made to order. It's kinda cool. You can stand at the counter and watch them cook the skewers. One very unique thing I've never seen at any other Persian restaurant is that where they have their takeout forks and napkins and stuff, they have little packets of sumac (a reddish spice powder with a smokey sour taste?) Very cool.  Their cheapest skewer meal at $9.99, the koobideh (a mix of ground lamb and beef), comes with two fairly large skewers, a roasted tomato, and rice (or half rice and half salad). I got half rice, half salad. My skewers, rice, and tomato were put into a big square takeout box, and it was full. It was quite amusing, because my full box of rice was only \"half\" of the regular portion of rice. They put my salad in another takeout box. This takeout box is the typical rectangular takeout box (or large size takeout box). The salad was lettuce based and then cucumber slices, cherry tomatoes, red onions, red cabbage and lemon slices were placed on top. Thousand Island served on the side (This was the tiniest portion of salad dressing for the largest \"half\" salad I've ever seen). Everything was very fresh and very flavorful. A very good meal for a very good price. Oh. I saw a guy ask for some kind of flatbread and I asked how I could get one as well. They just added it to my box for free! Nice. Not fresh (came out of a bag), but still very tasty.   Sometimes, the people behind the counter can't hear (or don't respond), but the man who was grilling the skewers was really friendly, and he answered all our questions. It is possible that some of the people behind the counter don't speak much English, but they definitely have fluent English speakers to serve you. Huzzah.  Seeing as that meal was very easily split up into three meals, at $9.99+tax, a surprisingly cheap eat in a not very cheap area."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been open about 6 months. I walked in on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised. This may very well be the best Persian food I've ever had. Super fresh, high quality ingredients, great flavour. Meat was grilled perfectly.  Not much space to sit down. Definitely a \"to go\" restaurant. A tad pricey, two or three dollars off my meal would've done the trick."}
{"text":"Beef kebabs were very delicious!!! $9.99 for 2 long kebabs, basmati rice with safran, salad and barbeque tomato was a great deal, we bought it as take outs, it is amazing quality and quantity for the price!!! will definitely go there often when i crave this type of food."}
{"text":"We've only done take out here and its great for it.  We've had the burger (very good), the chicken kabob sandwich (I really enjoyed it), and the kababs (I've had better but for take out and the cost, its just right).  I would recommend this place for take out Persian food if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My first experience with Persian food and it's a great start! I ordered the koobideh kebab and it was tasty! Well seasoned mix of beef and lamb skewers. For beginners, imagine the texture of a meat ball spread out on a skewer. Then chared over a flame. Served with basmati rice. I want to try the jojeh kebab for my next visit and will report back. Also expect to wait for a bit since the meat is made to order! Be patient, the chef is working his magic and cooking your meat to perfection."}
{"text":"Same great place but the prices have been increased by about 12%. Why - I'm not sure. Lunch for 3 costs about $40 plus taxes.   Makes me a bit upset seeing as it used to cost about $10 per head before the renovations. P.S - washrooms no more."}
{"text":"Very generous portions.  Food was great and people there are friendly.  Not too much seatings. Parking can also suck from time to time.  Took take out for our leftovers and left them in the car when we went to return something from Ikea. When we return the car smelled like gas lol Don't recommend eating the food in the car or getting take out unless you want your car to smell after."}
{"text":"One of the best Persian food I've ever had in Toronto. Big portions and reasonable price. We tried their baghali polo, Ash gusht and kubideh kebab, and they were all good and tasty."}
{"text":"If I could give -5 stars to the quality of the food here and the hygiene and cleanliness I would!  Tried them twice after as I happened to be in the area and needed some quick beef & chicken kebab.   Friendly staff and the positive ends right here.   The quality is terrible and while I was waiting for my food there was flies flying all left the place   Next time if I'm starving I wouldn't set food in this low quality place."}
{"text":"Been 2nd time visit this joint. They have good good. If you not big eater, better if you have friend to share the food. The koobideh dinner good for 2 people. They employees and the owner is friendly."}
{"text":"The food is good but costumer service is annoyingly poor!!! I got my appetizer after mian dish and she took my plate when I was working on it!!!"}
