{"text":"When I want to eat Italian cuisine, Paisano's is my choice. I really like their pasta (not much of their pizza though) and I try to experiment by ordering different pasta dish from time to time and they were all very tasty. Here are three dishes that my friends and I order the most:

- Chicken Parmigiano: This is my favorite and it is what I always get when I come to Paisano's. The chicken is tender and thick, topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella, & parmesan cheese. It also comes with linguine pasta. Really awesome and very filling. (I like my tomato sauce to be a little spicy to add some taste)

- Shrimp Marinara: Black tiger shrimp sautéed in a white wine, garlic tomato sauce. Also comes with linguine pasta. This is also one of my favorites. Making the tomato sauce spicy really works well with the shrimp and the overall seafood-pasta feel.

- Lasagna: To me, it tastes like every other lasagna but I found it better than average. My friends found it to be very tasty so if you're lasagna fan, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Simply awful!

The chicken dish that I ordered was awful. There were chunks of fat attached to chicken that were well masqueraded by the sauce but that I could taste. I just wonder why they could not cut the fat out before cooking the chicken. In addition, the sauce very much resembled a can sauce that I used on one of the dishes I cooked at home."}
{"text":"Great Italian food with Italian-sized portions! I had the vegetarian risotto and shared one the meat pizzas as an appetizer. Everything was delicious and best of all, affordable! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"A considerable disappointment.  I found this place while going to the Rona's hardware store nearby and was excited to try a high-class Italian place near where I live, but unfortunately, this restaurant was something of a let-down.

First of all, service was very, very, very slow.  While the staff seemed young and pleasant, it took them 10 minutes after I sat down before finally coming by to ask what I wanted to drink or what my order was.  I ordered a cheese garlic bread and a honey-garlic salmon, and then it was nearly another half hour before I finally got the food.

The garlic bread was good, though not cheap ($6) for just four pieces.  But there's plenty of cheese and butter and the flavour was good.  Unfortunately, the salmon was a huge letdown.  It's $20, not that cheap, but they failed to get any flavour inside of the fish and most of the fish was tasteless and oily, and even quite fishy.  They did do a good job pan-searing the thin portion so it's crispy, but it tasted like it wasnt marinated or flavoured.  The only flavour came from the sauce, which was definitely not what I'd call honey garlic; it tastes more like some kind of fruit-based sweet sauce, apple or peach, and it jarred painfully with the fish.  There was also so little of it that it didn't come close to adding flavour to the fish.

It may be 40 minutes farther away, but I'm sticking with La Veranda Osteria."}
{"text":"Friendly and welcoming staff but the food has gone downhill since the new management took over .  Portions are smaller and prices higher ."}
{"text":"i've my 2nd visit and i was not disappointment!... i had the salmon on the 1st visit a nd ordered it again.   the service was spectacular... and that's the reason why Mike our waiter should be employee of the month!!! And i only want to sit at the table that he is hosting."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this 3.5 stars. I would say It's good but not spectacular.  Since moving to yonge/shep area have not had much luck with local spots. Ordered from here last night expecting something just OK but it was actually pretty good. Not exactly gourmet or 100% authentic but tasty. We got a sausage pizza, penne vodka and bruschetta.  As for delivery it was fantastic. We ordered online on their very easy to use website at 8:40 and it came at 9;08 which is amazing! It also came piping hot. The prices as far as delivery are very reasonable, especially when compared to other delivery in the area. (hero burger has the nerve to charge 38$ for a burger and a veggie burger ALONE no fries or drinks) I'm going tout on a limb and saying its the best Italian in the area.  We will definitely order again 

EDIT: ordered again.... this place is so fast like 20 min from order to door. and food is scalding  and I mean scalding hot which for us is amazing. Got pesto primavera which was delicious fresh green homemade pesto and the meat lovers pizza  got garlic bread which was soft and delicious made with real butter and garlic"}
{"text":"Good food, like the service in restaurant, but will never order pickup or delivery again. They always get it wrong, never apologize and never make it up to you."}
{"text":"The pizzas are nice! I liked the \"Meat Lovers\" the best!
The antipasto was also  a great choice.
Good service too!!"}
{"text":"Hearty Italian food, duck confit serves two legs and two sides. Pasta was good as well. Great place to go when you don't wanna cook."}
{"text":"I have had take-out from here before that had been pretty good, so we went to Paisano's for dinner. The food is as I anticipated, pretty good, especially the lasagna, worth going back there for that. 

The blackened salmon was also enjoyable and was accompanied by standard steamed veg and rice. The service was also notably prompt, efficient and friendly. 

However, the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired. The decor is very dated, the lighting is unpleasant, and the crowd largely 70+. Not exactly where I want to spend a Saturday night. But I will be getting take-out from there again undoubtedly."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant when I'm living uptown.
The chicken parmigiano is amazing.  I order it every time.  It costs $16.99. The portion is quite large and I always leave feeling stuffed and/or with a doggie bag of chicken to add to tomorrow's lunch.  The chicken is still amazing the next day.  It comes with linguine and tomato sauce on the side, and some carrots/broccoli/cauliflower with garlic and oil.  Linguine is my favourite type of pasta.  I can't even comprehend how they got this dish so perfectly.  

I used to also order a great seafood pasta dish with linguine in a tomato sauce, but I haven't been able to find it on the menu lately.  It might've been the 'seafood creole' but I swear I would have never ordered any dish that contained the word 'creole'.  Perhaps the menu changed, but other than this one thing, I don't notice any other differences.  

This is the one restaurant that I've ever liked enough to recommend to friends, and said friends have always seemed to genuinely like it too.  
The parking isn't great though, and it gets a little busy on weekend evenings, although in recent years it seems as though there is usually always an empty table for 4 available.  I don't think they take weekend reservations, which is annoying.
I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"My gf and friends decided to come here on a special evening to enjoy this rare long lasting thriving business. Yes, its been open for 50 years! Are they serving real 'Italian' food? I'm not sure, but its safe to say they're doing something good.

Seating capacity is able to fit quite a bit. We ordered the deluxe pizza as app, which I thought was alright. My gf got the eggplant entree which is not bad, I thought 'Antica Pizzeria' in Niagara Falls is better. I got the lasagna, which is not bad, I can eat it. Its more sauce than the noodles though. They say that if your pasta is drowned with sauce, it may not be that great. But I'd say this place is good, and I'd come back and enjoy their other dishes.

If you order the chicken parm, its pretty BIG!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the lasagna that others have recommended and love it! The mussels in white wine was also delicious and inexpensive too so definitely give it a try. While it may be a little hard to find parking on the weekends, this place has become one of my favourite Italian places due to inexpensive yet delicious food and decent service."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years.  It has switched hands a couple of times during that period but the food and service has always been awesome.  Try the Chicken Parmesan or the pizza."}
{"text":"Was there last week and had a great meal (Tuscan pizza). Service was great and everyone else loved their meals!"}
{"text":"service decent
food quite good
décor-forget it
is this an Italian restaurant with the worst non-Italian bread (non crusty and non tasty ever in an Italian restaurant
pizza above average.
I would not rush back but if in the neighborhood would return"}
{"text":"Italian sausage pizza was delicious.  Service was good. This restaurant feels like a neighborhood place for a casual lunch hang out.
Deco is too plain & dark, tho."}
{"text":"One of the few Italian restaurants I like. You can randomly order anything on the menu and it will be good. The parking lot is very small, though."}
{"text":"Absolutely recommend this Italian restaurant 
Food is delicious and service is perfect"}
{"text":"We take my parents here a lot.  Our last dining experience was disappointing!  I ordered my usual linguini and white clam sauce, not on the menu but they always accommodate me, it was delicious as always.  The service however was below par.  Maybe it was an off night for our server.  But we had to keep asking for napkins, cheese, bread and water.  We asked several times, until  we finally asked another server, who was very  pleasant and obliging!  The food is always great!!  We will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Our favourite Italian place by far in North York. We bring my parents and in-laws here anytime they visit from out of town... in fact they always request we go to Paisanos when they come to the city. Amazing portion sizes and quality for the price! It provides that casual dining experience but with fine dining quality if you ask me! And without the snobby menu prices  Go here!"}
{"text":"Always fresh, Especially good for takeout - try the spaghetti bolognaise.  Always made fresh to order.  Nice, friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Such an awesome service, no wonder they are so many years in business. Their pizzas and pasta carbonara are delicious"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant
Good place to satisfy your italian food cravings!"}
{"text":"I have attended this restaurant with my boyfriend a number of times and have always left satisfied. The staff is extremely friendly and always made sure we were taken care of throughout our stay.

They have a good menu with a lot of options. The Chicken Parmesan is unbelievably delicious!! Try it, you will not go wrong. It is definitely their best dish and the staff will tell you that themselves. Their prices are fair especially considering the quality and amount that you get. 

They recently renovated,  and the atmosphere is nice and fairly quiet, good for couples and families. Since the renovations the lighting is a bit weird but nothing major."}
{"text":"The place isn't half bad...

- My family and I are big eaters so we ordered a dish each.

- We ordered the following:
+ (the fatass) APPETIZER PLATTER; which included Garlic Shrimp, Grilled Calamari , Bruschetta , Garlic Bread... yeah definitely fatass. I was already full from here.
+CLAM CHOWDER (oooou how Authentic Italian lolol), my dad ordered it.
+MEAT LOVERS PIZZA (a large one, of course since my mom was like on \"going all out\" mode), I've tasted better, it was good but like a few steps above Delissio, lol.
+SHRIMP CREOLE PASTA (lol Creole? I thought we're having Italian), my mom ordered it and it wasn't bad
+SHRIMP ARRABBIATTA, sister ordered it and it wasn't bad either
+VEAL PARMESAN, because I wanted something covered in tomato sauce and it was good too...but I've tasted better.
+broski had the LASAGNA, and it was alright too.
+daddyo had the GRILLED VEAL TENDERLOIN, yeah this one was actually really good.

- Overall, the food was definitely good. Not mind-blowing or memorable though.
- My sister's boyfriend being Italian himself makes better food IMHO.
- Server was nice and knew his stuff, but having to look for him just to get the bill was kind of... annoying. But that didn't really ruin the experience.

I don't think I would eat here again simply because I've tasted better food elsewhere and it wouldn't even cost me a penny (my sister's bf's house lololol). The experience was not memorable. 

I however would not mind recommending this to someone who would like to have some okay Italian food. Their portions are as big as your ass (if you have a big ass), so definitely you will not leave hungry. My family is such a fatty that it is definite that we did not leave this place hungry, even though I can recall that we did go to Dairy Queen after for dessert, which has become a ritual for us............lol such fatties."}
{"text":"Years ago, this place was a small, mostly take out pizza place at Bayview Village Mall.  They expanded there and became an Italian hot table that was very popular and very good.

They closed down a number of years ago, and after a short interlude, opened in this out-of-the-way location on Willowdale Ave., N of Sheppard in North York.

It is very popular and very busy, and doesn't take reservations on Saturday night, but our group of 8 got lucky, arriving just before 6:30.

Our server was fast and friendly.

The menu is large and varied, and the portions are very generous.  They have 3 vegetarian dishes (2 eggplant and one risotto) and many vegetarian pasta options.

I had the Eggplant Bocconcini, which comes with linguine and veggies, and it was pretty good, if not a bit too tomato saucy (but some would like that).  The bruschetta was very tasty, but their choice of bread is a bit weird.  It was like sliced sourdough bread, and it is the same as the regular bread they bring to the table, and is also used for garlic bread.

Others were happy with their meals, but no one raved.  No one had it, but the pizza would probably be a good choice.  It was excellent back at Bayview Village.  My wife and I plan to go back to give it a try."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the place has changed since the owners split up and you can really feel that in the food quality. The real paisano's food is now served at the york mills location.

Went there to get my all time favourite fettuccine salmon, was not the same creamy sauce as always 65% of the sauce was GREASE. When I (somehow) finished my plate I saw a significant amount of oil on my plate! See pictures. Orange oily grease. Both my boyfriend and I got sick I had nausea and sick stomach for a full day after. Never again sorry. Service however was amazing as always, especially the blonde slim gentleman who is there quite often - made our experience a little better!"}
{"text":"You know those Italian restaurants that are better than you could have made at home, but don't absolutely blow your mind? That's sort of how I felt about Paisano's. One step up from average, in the most endearing way possible. I would give it 3 and a half stars if I could!

They have a fairly lengthy menu (all the usual salad/app/main suspects) and really friendly and prompt service. Recommend Melissa H. if you're in there, she's especially fantastic. I ordered the manicotti, which was tasty but SUPER filling. As you would assume with a pasta shell stuffed with ricotta...
The pizzas also looked delicious, so maybe next time. 

The decor is typical older Italian restaurant, but it seems to always be busy! Like I said, it's pretty good. Not QUITE 4 stars, but I'd go again!"}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant is definitely a huge hit in the Willowdale area. Upon approaching the restaurant, you can smell the wonderful garlic scent. You can make reservations for any day except on Fridays and Saturdays on their website or call in. This place is always busy during the dinner hours so it's better to put a reservation down or you can order takeout online on their website.

As for the food, my party usually orders the large caesar salad, deluxe pizza, and choice of pasta as an entree. The large caesar salad is solid option to share with your table. It's simple as they add the right amount of dressing. The deluxe pizza always comes piping hot and fresh and the size is perfect to share or ordered as a single entree. 

If you like saucy pastas, this place is definitely the place you want to visit. I've tried their chicken carbonara, chicken penne, chicken mushroom, and chicken al pesto. Out of all these pastas, I enjoy the chicken carbonara and chicken penne. Both have their unique differences as the chicken carbonara comes with grilled chicken and bacon while the chicken penne comes with fried chicken and mushrooms. Good pasta overall. 

The ambience of the restaurant is alright. Although it is very casual, it can get very loud at times from everybody chattering in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great new location , food still fantastic, service excellent ,  their bread is the only downside, which they wold give nice Italian bread and not the supermarket cheap sliced white bread"}
{"text":"Yes, they opened, under new ownership...same Willowdale location.......same menu, same lovely ambiance, but the food, oh the food......  Portions were considerably smaller, Cesar salad was completely different with an oil based dressing, not the creamy kind, as we have known to love!!  My pasta dish was ok, seafood was minimal......said was just ok.  Sorry to see the food has changed so drastically......this was our go too place when in the city......."}
{"text":"One word...amazing. It was their last night before moving to a new location and they went above and beyond to please us under challenging conditions. Service was fantastic.  Solid five star performance."}
{"text":"A friend was raving about this place. Went in and the place looks cozy and has ambiance. Good for a date or romantic dinner. We were told they had the 3rd best lasagna in the city and the waiter recommended the Parmesan Chicken.

We ordered the Parmesan chicken, lasagna, and meat ball spaghetti. While it was decent and the portions were large it didn't blow me away. The Parmesan chicken was fried in heavy oil, more so than what I would like. Might consider going back if I'm in the area. 

The price was very reasonable $20 per person."}
{"text":"Nice casual restaurant with great italian food. I love their beef and veal dishes. Pasta with lemon sauce is delicious as well. Best to go during off peak hours as they do get busy. I definitely will be back when I'm in the mood for italian food.  Nice patio in the summer and lots of free parking."}
{"text":"I ordered a Penne Sausage pasta and it was absolutely delicious. My parents ordered a lasagna and fish dish, resepctively. The pasta and lasagna dishes were swimming in sauce which we loved. Portion sizes were filling. Service was quick and amazing."}
{"text":"A gorgeous experience in these Italian fooood!!This is the 1st Italian restaurant I ate in Toronto that did't let me down. Price is fair and the service is very kind too."}
{"text":"I had salmon and it was very delicious. The price is fair for italian resturant. But i had hard time finding parking ,although they have their own private parking lot. It was full and it took time for me to find parking nearby."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for my birthday dinner and I must say, we were impressed. The portions were huge so our hunger was satisfied with just one pasta or pizza dish each. The food is cooked to perfection, always served fresh and hot. Our waiter was super friendly and he even got us an extra bread basket when we asked for it at no extra charge. The food is flavourful, of excellent quality, and worth every penny. Almost all the vegetarian items listed are actually vegetarian (i.e. eggless, without meat, chicken, or fish) with the exception of the eggplant parmesan. One of the first things I look for when researching a new restaurant is the availability of vegetarian food and Paisanos exceeded my expectations. I will definitely be coming back and recommending this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Authentic family owned italian resto...Has amazing pasta! I especially love the rose sauce. Stay away from their desserts though, I tried the cheesecake and creme brulee, and was not impressed."}
{"text":"All things considered, being who else around within a 40 minute walk, will essentially make this the default diner. Great service, but their food is just average. Nothing to write home about, so I'll stop here."}
{"text":"The server was very nice, attentive and accommodating.  The food was tasty and well priced.  The decor was pleasing.  And free parking is always appreciated.

Minor areas for improvement:
- stop using non-recyclable styrofoam containers for leftovers
- assume a table of single women want separate bills or ask rather than handing the bill for the whole table to one of us"}
{"text":"Nice place for a date
Service here is awesome every time!! One of the best places to go for Italian in north York 
Their eggplant parmigiana is to die for"}
{"text":"Ok. So we visited this place after meeting up with friends. 

We started with the antipasto.  The portions were small especially since there was 5 of us.  Better for two people. The glaring issue was the lack of bread or something to eat with the food. 

Next I had the pizza and the daughter had the chicken parmigiana.  The pizza was tasty but the crust didn't taste like it preprocessed.  Think McCain pizza.  The toppings and cheese was tasty 

The chicken parm was Hoo hum.  What drove my daughter batty was the service.  Quick to follow up about the food - hot and tasty but refills or drinks or water felt like she was no where near by.  We had to ask for a pitcher to serve ourselves.  When my daughter and others were offered ground pepper or grated parmigian cheese the server would reach across my daughter.  Even when she cleared the appetisers plates.  Once was ok but 3-4 times became annoying. 

Was disappointed.  Too bad as the desserts looked worth giving it a try but we decided to leave instead."}
{"text":"Zero customer service skills , food was okey nothing special . Not a welcoming atmosphere our waiter was not helpful at all . Basically not a good experience ."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. The brucshetta was really good. We had carbarnera and bolognese pasta which were both quite nice. The decor was quaint and inviting. I would go again."}
{"text":"Live this place. Atmosphere 4/5. Reminds me of a old school Italian joint. Parking is tough sometimes. Always busy on the weekends. Expect to wait a bit during dinner time. Food 5/5. Really really really good. Pizza and calamari are excellent. Go with the veal or chicken parm. You won't regret it ."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend for lunch we ordered a bruschetta appetizer which was not very tasty. We both had the veal sandwich which was very tasty and loaded with good cheddar cheese and was a good size and good prize . We also had the cream cheese cake for desert which was impeccable. Overall the service was very good and the food was decent would recommend to try it out"}
{"text":"My sister and I used to go to their Bayview Village location fifteen or so years ago. Their pizzas and bruschetta were very, very tasty. Fast forward fifteen or so years and we decided to check out Paisano's at their 'new' location.

Pros
- There is a parking lot so no need to worry about paying for parking.
- Spacious restaurant with a lot of seating.
- Menu is extensive enough that you can bring a picky eater here.

Cons
- The food here is very mediocre; my sister and I ordered pizzas (the Deluxe and Pepperoni) and realized that they were not the same from so many years ago.
- Service was almost non-existent; our server barely came to our table.
- Outdated decor when this place hasn't been around t h a t long.

I'm a-okay if I don't come back here as my experience was a-okay."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago with my aunt - we were craving Italian food and she knew of Paisano's - a delicious Italian restaurant with all kinds of items to choose from.  The service was always helpful and friendly and we didn't have to wait long despite the number of customers already seated. 

They start you off with bread and butter but unfortunately, the bread looked just like slices of plain white bread from the grocery store. 

We started off with the Soup of the Day ($5) - I forget what the soup was called  (the soup of the day isn't written on the menu but the server will tell you about it) but it was a sort of creamy corn soup. I think it was the best thing I had that night - creamy and sweet it was a yummy way to start our dinner. 

I ordered off their chicken pasta section of the menu - the Raffaella ($16) - chicken breast, roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, snowpeas, penne pasta, and a rose sauce. It was okay - I'd never had snowpeas in pasta before but it adds a bit of a bitter taste to it. I don't known if I'd order it again - it was, overall, more on the bitter side of pastas and it felt like it could use more sauce. 

My aunt ordered the Seafood Creole ($16) - shrimp, calamari, clams, salmon, mussels, linguine pasta, and a marinara sauce. My aunt was really satisfied with it.  I had the chance to try it and while I liked it more than my dish, I thought its seafood components overpowered the dish - I know it's a seafood pasta, and there's a lot of ingredients from the sea in it to prove it, but they didn't blend too well with the marinara sauce and with each other. 

For dessert, we ordered the Homemade Tiramisu ($5) - layers of espresso & liquor-soaked sponge cake alternating with mascarpone cheese, and topped with grated chocolate. At first bite, it tasted a bit too cold - like it had been in the fridge for the day (not the freshest, but I didn't expect it to be) but it was an overall yummy dessert - had notes of the coffee with remnants of liquor and it was presented beautifully. 

Overall, Paisano's was a good experience - ambient, cozy, great service, and, for the most part, good food - not amazing, but good enough. While I don't think I'd order the pastas we got this time again,  I would come here again for that creamy corn soup, to try more of their desserts, or to try more on their menu - Paisano's has a lot to offer and I'm always down to try more Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"They have really cut back on food and quality. You used to get three nice pieces of the Lemon Veal which is now two small pieces. The Veal Parmigiana was all breading and hardly any veal, vegetables were ice cold.  If it were free, we would not go back, that is how bad the food was.  I felt badly for our server for she tried very hard, but could not compensate for the poor quality of what the kitchen is turning out."}
{"text":"We went there at the behest of family for a small belated post municipal election celebration. There were 5 of us in the party, and we had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. This is one busy and popular place, and that, at least for me is a good indicator. Our dinner companions had been there numerous times and they said they really liked the place.

The menu is laid out in a slightly quirky fashion for the entrees, with a bit of repetition. But its all there except for one of my favorites Putanesca Sauce, which is absent.

I chose as an entree the Veal Aliolio, which was tender and well prepared. I also tasted my wife's Veal Marsala which was also well prepared. The meat used did not need to be tenderized (as many establishments do), and the preparation was good.

Our table was dominated by a large screen TV which enabled two of our dinners to follow a hockey game.

This a good local place, well attended and well liked. They have something here. We will return from time to time."}
{"text":"OK is sort of the perfect description of this place. It's fine...it's not great!

We went here on a Saturday night. It's literally a block away from where we live and we have somehow never been. We finally decided to go for it!

The atmosphere is fine. It's nice and clean and much larger than you would realize from the outside. The decor it a bit cheesy with faux Roman sculptures. 

Service was very good. The waiter was quick with our drinks and food and was helpful with suggestions. 

Now to the food. My husband ordered the veal parm and I ordered a pasta with chicken. We ordered brushetta as a starter. I noticed from the menu that, while a lot of selection, many of the pasta dishes were a bit uninspired. A lot of very basic dishes. Pasta with mushrooms and red sauce, or pasta with shrimp and pesto, etc. I really enjoy creative combinations and flavours when I go to an Italian restaurant, because quite honestly, I can make the basic stuff at home...for a hell of a lot cheaper.

That said, the pasta dishes were solid, if nothing special. My pasta was well cooked, but the chicken tasted like something you would find in a McDonald's salad and the mushrooms were good, but that was the basis of the dish. My husband's was basic, but veal parms usually are. He did note that there was a LOT of sauce on his. There was, but I like that personally, if there is bread to dip into it...but no bread was served to our table, other than the bread from our brushetta. 

The brushetta wasn't great. The tomato mixture on top was good, but the bread wasn't properly toasted, so it got soggy and couldn't hold its shape. It kept falling apart when you picked it up. 

The desserts really brought this place back for me. I had their homemade creme brule and it was really excellent. On the menu it tells you which are made in-house and I would highly recommend getting one of those. 

Overall, it was quite expensive for pretty basic Italian food, so it didn't stun me. I'm not opposed to going back, but it's not my first choice. My major reason for going back will be for convenience, because it is so close to us."}
{"text":"Compared to other Italian restaurants I've been to, I would have to rate this one a 3 star... maybe a 3.5.

I used to work relatively close to this restaurant and would come here often with friends after work to have a nice relaxing meal and a catch-up.  Unfortunately, since our office moved a few years ago, I haven't been back that often... actually, not at all.

To my surprise, someone brought it up as a suggestion for lunch the other day and I was excited to come back and have my favourite meal at this restaurant; Chicken Carbonara!

As soon as I walked in the door, the aromas took me back to those earlier days; enjoying good food with great friends. Unfortunately, my memory seems to have failed me when it comes to the ambiance of this place. There's plenty of seating in this restaurant but the little added touches (or rather, lack there of) don't do them any favours.

I guess to give you the 'Italian' feel, you are surrounded with plaster reliefs and busts... oh and they've also thrown in a couple of TV's for good measure, one of which was displaying pictures of menu items along with their descriptions. And with that, the ambiance was destroyed.

Also, having gained a little experience over the years, I don't consider machine sliced bread with little packages of butter to be very 'Italian' at all! An Artisan loaf with a little olive oil and perhaps some balsamic vinegar would have been a nicer touch... and in my opinon, not too much to ask for. But I digress.

The menu selection hasn't change much (if at all) with items ranging between $10 - $15.  There's plenty to choose from but I, of course, stuck with my Chicken Carbonara. Chicken breast, bacon, green onion and  parmesan cheese served on spaghetti and tossed in a cream sauce. This dish was exactly how I remembered it and I was happy to have it again.

The service was... generic. Quick and pleasent enough but somewhat non-descript.

Maybe it's true what they say... you can never go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend grew up in North York and this restaurant has been a family favourite. We moved out of the area and hadn't been there in a couple of years so we tried it again last night. I remember liking this spot but last night left a lot to be desired. We both thought something had changed. Based on other reviews I'm wondering if pizza is their strength and perhaps we should have gone with that instead. 

We were seated quickly and staff was friendly. Our meals came out at the same time as our drinks, so surprisingly fast. Normally that is not something to complain about but it kind of made me wonder why and we didn't really have a chance to get settled before the meal. It almost felt rushed. Usually a bread basket is pretty standard at an Italian restaurant but we had to request this after the meals came; it wasn't automatically brought to us. The bread was just sliced white Italian, like what you can pick up in a grocery store. No authenticity to it at all really.

My boyfriend wanted shrimp fettuccine Alfredo, which they don't offer so you have to order the vegetarian option and add shrimp to it. The additional charge was $5 and he got exactly 5 pieces of shrimp, so $1 per shrimp. I ordered Chicken Al Pesto which was $16. I think these two meals are comparable with the pasta, sauce and protein yet one was $19 and the other $16, a price differentiation that didn't seem right. Actually they offer a Shrimp Al Pesto which is $16 so does cream sauce really cost $3 more than pesto sauce? I have costed menus in the past for work and it just seemed like a big difference to me. We don't mind the $5 but give us more shrimp. The sauces were bland. I didn't really taste any garlic in my dish. Although the colour was green, the basil flavour was non-existent. When I make pesto at home, I usually blend the pine nuts into the sauce, but these were mixed in whole, so you could only taste them when you bit into one but there weren't enough in the dish to have one in every bite. Overall it was more like a cream sauce than pesto, so if you're looking for an olive oil based pesto sauce, this is not it. 

We haven't written them off completely but if we go back we will probably try pizza instead."}
{"text":"Another business lunch spot!

WOW was it ever goooooood!

Ordered:
1. Garlic Cheese Bread ($6 for four huge pieces)
2. Raffaella Pasta ($12)
3. Margherita Pizza ($11)
4. Take out: To take back to my assistant - Chicken Club Sandwich ($12)

Everything was divine! And obviously the prices are amazing! 

Staff was friendly and helpful, knew the menu inside out and made me feel confident that my tree nut allergy was being taken seriously. LOVE THAT!

We were there at noon on an April Friday and it was very busy. Even the parking lot at the back was almost full! I got the last spot!

Highly recommended! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We went there for a family dinner about a week ago and we were not that impressed. About half of us ordered pasta dishes and the other half ordered stuff like sole and eggplant parm. All of the dishes though were steaming hot when they came out, which is usually an indicator of microwaved food.
The pasta dishes were okay but nothing special. The eggplant parm and sole type dishes on the other hand were not good. The potatoes were hard and the vegetables were not tasty. Considering there were a handful of vegetarian dishes, this was a disappoint.
The service was okay, and I'm not going to knock the waiter who was fairly new to the job, but we would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very tasty Italian dinner! Food was delicious n our server was v attentive and pleasant! He even put in extra effort to make our dessert plates look extra pretty! =) Ordered the escargots which was cooked in a tomato sauce n had the veal with mushroom sauce. Portions were generous and def save room for dessert. The tiramisu was v creamy n tasty and not too sweet. Will def go back!"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant - was busy on a weekday evening, which is always a good sign. Our server was very attentive, and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I went here for the second time and I was extremely disappointed.  The service was decent and the portions of their dishes are massive.  Too bad the food is ALL bland.  Their escargot was tasteless and chewy.  The calamari was soggy and again had no seasoning.  The chicken parmesan needed a LOT of help and their complimentary bread is like eating cardboard with their packaged butter.  This place needs to hire a new chef or get new owners that have a palate.  I make better italian and I suck at cooking.  Sorry for such a bad review but I went on my 5 years wedding anniversary because the original restaurant we wanted to go to was too far.  Should have sucked it up and driven an extra 20 minutes."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Italian restaurants in the city, although I was a bit disappointed with the service. My waiter seemed to rush a bit even though it was a Wednesday night and there was no line up. He didn't come back to refill our drinks without being asked.

I have been here many times before, and some of my favourite pastas are the following,
- linguine clams pasta
- shrimp Portabello pasta

I wish their waiters would smile a little."}
{"text":"My parents live in the area & we were looking for quality take out food that was available for delivery.  
We found it,  
The food was delivered so fast & it was hot....and I mean HOT.  The meat sauce on the spaghetti was delicious (not oily or too tomatoey) and one portion was large enough for 2 people.  A large Caesar salad was enough to split between the three of us.  The salad was fresh & the salad dressing was amazing.
If you're in the mood for good Italian food but don't feel like going out, Paisano's is the perfect choice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had the spaghetti Bolognese , he said it was just ok and could not taste the meat. My Penne Arrabiatta  was also just ok, they need to work on the perfecting the sauce. I would not order this dish again. The bruschetta was Excellent!! Our waitress was great, very attentive, don't remember her name but she was blond short hair, pulled back in a ponytail. Great service. I'm a vegetarian and they have so many options for me that I will  be back and give this place a chance.

JULY 21 2013 came back... My boyfriend and I both had the Minestrone soup= Excellent!!! (Recommend) He has the small Hawaiian Pizza He loved it. I had the large Italian Salad= just ok hated that the tomatoes wedges were extremely large and, didn't like the huge onions, would nor order again. Service was fast. Indian Gentleman :)

July 22 2013

Had the veggie Lasagna = surpassed my expectation. The tomato sauce was out of this world ( unlike the Arrabiatta from the other day. Weird!) Will come back for this dish!! My boyfriend had the tiramisu, tried it = good taste but a bit on the soggy side."}
{"text":"We went to that wonderful gem of a restaurant a few weeks ago. Beautiful and delicious food, tasty drinks, and oh so wonderful service. It was a perfect date at a perfect place."}
{"text":"I went there several times. Nice tasty pasta and pizza.  friendly staff. But no parking around! Everytime there is a issue where to put your car!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch! Staff were friendly and helpful and the portions are large and filling. I got the Dijon mustard chicken dish and it was quite tasty and economical as well :)"}
{"text":"I live five minutes from here and never knew about Paisano's. We came here on Family Day with a group of seven. The restaurant is quite spacious, and was moderately full throughout the evening. I was able to find a parking spot in their back parking lot, but it was quite full around dinnertime. A few of our friends were able to find parking on side streets and other lots. Our waiter was very amicable, but service was a tad slow, likely because there were a number of large groups. 

I ordered the rosemary duck - a simple protein dish with potatoes and veggies, but the flavours were fantastic. It was one of the higher-priced items at $25, but worth trying. The pizzas are much better value at $15 - $17. I'd say that Paisano's is quite on par with other Italian restaurants in Toronto, but nothing was especially worth noting."}
{"text":"Easily one of our favourite restaurants - eat here usually once a week.

I've never been disappointed by the quality of food or service. A North York staple :)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and delicious pizza, I'll definitely be coming back for more. The pesto chicken pizza is delicious, fresh and filling."}
{"text":"I just like the location because it's close to my place & patio. The only issue is when you order a veal sandwich do not expect a proper bun,  you will receive a hamburger bun. I was so turned off with a veal sandwich and will never order it again. At least have the proper bun for veal if you're going to be an Italian restaurant. I also ordered the mussels in white wine sauce which wasn't that great. I think they can do better and up their flavor."}
{"text":"My comments have nothing to do with the food.  This is strictly a customer service issue.  I called from NY to try and order dinner for a friend.  Their child had surgery and I knew they were pretty wiped out, so I wanted to send them a dinner.  They said we don't currently deliver, but we will again in March.  I get it, it's a business, you're not set up for a delivery business, but I'm asking for a one time delivery under abnormal circumstances.I offered to pay any delivery fee they wanted, or if they could just call an UBER, I'd pay double the UBER fee or whatever.  They wouldn't even consider it, just flat no can't help.  I figured ok, I'll call my own taxi or carservice.  Signed up to their website, placed a big order, went to pay by credit card, it says call.  I call back, and they don't take credit cards unless it's in person.  I explained, look I'm in NY can you make an exception?  Guy couldn't care less, too bad so sad, we only take credit cards in person.  Shocked at the callous attitude."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice but I really enjoyed both times! I ordered a pizza the first time and the salmon pasta the second time, and both were great.  I think I prefer this restaurant to Terroni, which has a similar Italian energy.  I sampled my family's dishes as well and they all tasted great.  The servers were very attractive and polite and it is a wonderful dining environment.  The only downside is the fact that parking is very tricky as the parking lot is tiny, but I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I am a recent regular at Paisano's. I keep coming back for the quality, quantity and reasonable price of the food. The staff are very friendly. They are celebrating 50 years in business! This August they will be closed for renovations; so check before you go."}
{"text":"I went to paisanos couple of weeks ago with my husband for his birthday. The ambiance was really good and the waiter was good at suggesting us dishes. We got the grilled chicken pizza and chicken parmigiano, the breaded chicken cutlet was simply delicious. As we wanted it spicy he offered us chili flakes and  hot chilli oil.  I would recommend this place to my family and friends, and definitely visit again. It's worth the money."}
{"text":"This is Italian food for hosers, with not even an attempt at authenticity or hominess.  I'd give it one star but the service was reasonably polite.

As for the rest:  Atmosphere is nondescript and boring.  The bread was pasty and machine-cut and served cold with little packaged butter containers rather than olive oil.  Bruschetta was on the same icky bread and had way too much onion.  A Caesar salad had lettuce that was reasonably fresh but appeared to be sliced with a knife rather than torn and cheap tasting dressing that seemed like the kind that comes out of those little plastic packages at fast food restaurants.  An order of penne arrabiata was not spicy enough and was seriously overcooked.  Eggplant parmesan was not bad tasting, but in no way authentic  It came with a side of mushy looking frozen veggies and nondescript linguine.  Manicotti was rubbery and tasted like they has heated up some packaged frozen stuff and bathed it in sauce.  And speaking of sauce, it tasted like sour and cheap bottled pasta sauce without the slightest attempt to dress it up.

Better leave this place to the existing patrons who seem to crowd it.  My Italian housemate noted that there was not one face, either among the staff of the patrons, that actually looked Italian.

This place might get by in some small town where the word Italian is pronounced eye-talian but I think in Toronto one can find much better offerings.

Laura T., you CAN do better at home."}
{"text":"Had the pizza and it was wonderful. The place was packed, but the service was quick and friendly. Would certainly eat there again."}
{"text":"I really like this Italian restaurant in North York. I just recently discovered it thanks to a friend and we really enjoyed our meal here. You know a restaurant is good when it is Wednesday evening at 6 pm and that place is bustling AND it's not even in a high traffic place. In fact, if my friend didn't take me, I would probably never notice this place. But inside it is very nice and has a cozy and warm ambience. Great for a family dinner out or a semi casual date. 

We tried the following: 
Chicken carbonara  - tasty and creamy and good sized portion
Escargot in herb n tomato sauce - really good, multile pieces of escargot with bread for dipping the remaining sauce
Veal mushroom - tasty as well
Shirley Temple - refreshing drink

Service was also friendly and efficient and prices were reasonable. Check out their website for more info!"}
{"text":"After hearing good reviews from this place, my boyfriend and I decided to try it. We ordered takeout as we couldn't sit in due to time constraints, but we live in the area, so the food was still hot when we returned home. Unfortunately, we were quite disappointed with the food.

This restaurant feels like a family-style restaurant that has been around for a very long time (which it has, 50 years at least i think).  When I went to pick up my order from the guy at the bar, I took a good look around. The decor was a bit dated, though spacious, and the clientele was primarily an older crowd with a couple of families and couples. They also have a patio.

We ordered the chicken parmigiana and medium deluxe pizza which came to ~$40. When we got home to eat our food, my food was packed in a tray with three divisions, one for a few pieces of carrot and broccoli, one for linguine with tomato sauce, and in the middle was the breaded chicken. 

Quality and taste? Unfortunately, poor. The sauce was very bland and I actually had to add salt to it, which is not something I normally do.  The chicken was seasoned well enough, and the portion was large, but the pasta was nothing special as it was dried pasta, and the vegetables seemed like it was from frozen. The pizza? The bottom was slightly burned and although they called it \"gourmet pizza\" on their menu, it was far from it. The menu itself seems quite dated (particularly the photos) and lacked creativity.

All in all, I was quite disappointed. I thought that maybe getting takeout would taint my experience but I'm sure the sauce wouldn't have been more flavourful even if I had dined in. Unfortunately, there aren't too many good Italian restaurants around the area, but I think that next time I'd rather drive out a bit further south on Yonge for something better."}
{"text":"Pros:
Pretty good service
Prices are fair

Cons:
Pasta is precooked

I've heard some good things about this place so I decided to come out here for my GF's birthday.  Paisano's doesn't look to large from the outside, but there are plenty of tables available.  There are some semi private areas where you could hold a small function like parties are corporate dinners.

The service here on a whole was very good.  There was a tiny blip where our waitress forgot about us right after we were seated.  Luckily, one of the hostesses saw my looking around and came right up to help us.  Other than that, it was a great all around experience in terms of service.

We ordered two pastas and personal pizza to share with our little one.  The pastas were a chicken and mushroom cream sauce and a breaded chicken pesto.  The pizza was a simple mushroom pizza.  The pasta came out really quickly which sounded alarm bells in my head.  One taste and I knew the pasta was precooked.  As someone who loves pasta al dente, serving precooked pasta is a big no no for me.  The dish itself was still OK, but I couldn't fully enjoy it.  The pizza was pretty well done.  There was a good amount of cheese used which pleased my little one. 

If I hadn't heard of Paisano's before, I think I would of enjoyed this place a little more.  I came in with high expectations so a let down was definitely in the cards.  It's still an OK Italian restaurant, just not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Been about 10 years since i've been here. Had totally forgotten about it.

 Definitely a nice looking place since the expansion and the latest renovation. Service is good but seems a little rushed. Waiter wanted our order and we still were waiting for the rest of the guests at our table. I hate to say it but Service here has never been a strong point. Handing plates of food through people is just not what i consider quality restaurant etiquette. It's ok for a bar but if you renovate your pizzarea into a trying to be classy digs then you need to brief your staff on etiquette.

But overall the food was a plenty, my guests bot had pasta and seem quite happy with it. I chose to be a glutton and ordered their chicken Parmesan. If you want to be stuffed get this. Always a good choice. Was quite satisfied with the meal.
Overall the food came hot and was filling. Can't say they went off the fence on seasoning but i guess that's how they satisfy a broad range of aging customers."}
{"text":"Very bad service and ordinary food. The server did not even come once to ask how we were doing. Will not be going back"}
{"text":"We come here often as it is my hubby's favourite italian restaurant, but I honestly don't know why... The food here is incredibly mediocre and I cannot seem to find a single dish on the menu that I would want to get again. Don't get me wrong - it's not bad and there is nothing wrong with it, but I've had much much better Italian food elsewhere.
The service, however, is great and the waiters are very attentive. 4 stars because the hubby loves it, but personally, only 3 from me."}
{"text":"There wasn't much to complain about here but nothing to rave about either.
We tried pizza and pasta. Both were fine but not exceptional. The bread we were served was not made in house and we did not get olive oil and vinegar with it but butter which was unusual and disappointing at an Italian restaurant. 
The seating inside is plentiful, the atmosphere is nice, and our waiter was just lovely (he was very friendly and his service stood out), but as I consider food to be the star of the show, I won't be hurrying back here any time soon, though I won't say I'd never try it again."}
{"text":"A cute, authentic Italian restaurant quietly nestled in the North York neighborhood. 

Loved:
-The Meat Lover's Pizza
-The Seafood Linguine
-The affordable wine list
-The friendly, attentive and efficient service
-Ample seating, very family friendly.

Watch out for:
-There are limited spots in their parking lot located just behind the restaurant. There is street parking but you have to pay.
-If you enjoy a nice dining ambience, this is not the place to go. The decor is a bit dark and dingy but the food makes up for it.

I will definitely be back to try more items on their extensive menu."}
{"text":"Great place after a long hard day. Very good food and relax. The waiter Ryan  is awesome"}
{"text":"We always order from Paisanos because the pizza is easily one of my favourites in Toronto but every time we order our food is always hot!

I can always expect hot and yummy food whenever I order from the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this neighbourhood gem for Italian food. Tucked into the small street if Willowdale ave, this place has a non pretentious atmosphere, the food is delicious and fair prices. 
Our office has group gatherings here and we all love it!"}
{"text":"When it come to italian food i expect using lots of fresh ingrediants specially hand roll pastas but when i get dry one i'm not happy, the portions are so bigand the price is good for the quality, i tried the meat lasagna which comes with ricotta cheese instead of bechamel sauce and all the foods were bland:(
The servers wasnt around when you needed them"}
{"text":"Our family has been going to Paisano's for a long time now - they've been in our neighbourhood for longer than we have! Their food is consistently good (we get their garlic shrimp every time) and prices are reasonable. The service is very friendly and quick and the restaurant has a very homey and familiar feel. 

They're unfortunately moving from their long-time home on Willowdale because the property was sold to new developers, but I hope they have even more success at their new location. We'll definitely still make the trip over from time to time!"}
{"text":"Can't imagine Paisano's Italian Garden Cafe can be that busy on a Tuesday afternoon. We were here after having lunch at Inakaya and wanting to have some desserts and coffee. 

There were no dessert menu.. so basically they offer desserts of the day which were Creme Burlee and Tiramisu . The nice waiter said they were both home made and he likes Tiramisu  better... 

Cappuccino ($3) and Tiramisu  ($5) 
- Tiramisu  that served in a bowl like custard was quite good! Tons of firm non mushy lady fingers inside.. The cream is just rich and creamy enough mixed with the liquor! hmmm went so well with my Java! 

Services here is nice and friendly! But Paisano's is more like a casual Italian Family restaurant, don't come if you want a quiet, romantic dinner. BTW, the portions here looks huge! Maybe I have to come back here when I have any urges for pasta and be loaded with carbs! 

There is a small small parking lot at the back of the restaurant, but don't expect to find one! When you come in the afternoon there are some meter parkings along Willowdale.. but if you try parking on the residential streets you will get a ticket unless it is after 6 pm! 

They accepts all credit cards!"}
{"text":"Went there with my wife on a Saturday noon. Liked the atmosphere and service. Soup of the day was a bit too salty but tasty. Veggie lovers' pizza was excellent, with crispy bread. Loved the music...all helped us unwind from a busy week. 

Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the newly re-opened Paisano's Italian Garden Cafe around Willowdale and Sheppard. There was confusion as a few months ago this business advertised that they were going to move to the York Mills and Don Mills area. However, after going to this local Italian restaurant after they renovated and reopened, the owners notified us that they had split up. One team had decided to open up an Italian restaurant with the exact name \"Paisanos\" at York Mills/Don Mills and another team of owners decided to renovate and reopen at the Paisano's original location at 116 Willowdale Ave.

The owners explained to us that the concept of their newly re-opened restaurant was to incorporate fresher quality ingredients to their dishes. That way people would be able to tell the difference of their newly revamped restaurant. The decor also matches this vision they have for the restaurant as it looks much more modern and lively.

I have been to Paisanos many times before the renovation and I must say the ingredients used in the dishes is definitely of higher quality after they reopened. Service is often friendly and prices are reasonable for what you get. There is a reason why this local neighbourhood Italian restaurant often has many customers, even on weekdays."}
{"text":"I was there last night for dinner and one of the servers had long blonde hair and did not have it tied back, she was serving food to customers with one hand while flipping her long hair all over the place with the other hand, it was disgusting to watch and had she been serving food to my table I would have refused it.  I watched her several times running her hands through her long hair and then the next minute she was serving someone a plate of food.  What kind of restaurant owner would allow that? The other two female servers did have their long hair tied back.  The food was ok, not bad but also not great, just mediocre.  The latte was very watery, barely could taste any espresso at all."}
