{"text":"I am shocked, stunned, and extremely disappointed that Curry N a Hurry is closed. I am also disappointed beyond belief that the new company did not disclose this information when we called to place an order. The new restaurant Little India kept Curry n a Hurry's phone number and took our order as if nothing was different or changed. It was only when my husband went to pick up our food that he discovered the change. When we got home to eat the food, there was more disappointment. Nothing was the same. The receipes were all different, my butter chicken was definitely not the same. And one order of butter chicken didn't even feed myself and my son, there was so little chicken in the dish. With Curry n a Hurry the butter chicken would typically feed both of us for two meals. This is a deceiving, disappointing change and I will not go back to what is now called Little India. When you have had such amazing food from a favourite restaurant for such a long time, and then all of a sudden it's changed with no notice or acknowledgement, it's incredibly disappointing. And has left me still hungry. I will not be back and my husband and I are very sad for this change. Curry N a Hurry where did you go????? MINUS five stars for this new place."}
{"text":"The food at Curry N Hurry is AMAZING. Ever since my family moved to Hidden Valley, Curry N Hurry has become a legend in our home. Their coconut rice is awesome. If you are looking for something to brighten your day and satisfy your hunger, I sincerely recommend giving them a call."}
{"text":"I'm a huge indian food lover...and this is my second most favorite restaurant in Calgary (first being Moti Mahal).  What I enjoy about Curry N Hurry is that they are a small, family-run take out business who take pride in their product.  I can't tell you how many indian restaurants I have visited in this city where they use the cheapest, fattiest cuts of chicken in their butter chicken...Not curry n hurry!  They use only white meat!  I know it's more expensive...but the quality speaks for itself!  I hope they never change this in order to save a buck!  You can also control the spice level...so if you are someone who is always complaining that this food is bland...next time order hot...not white person hot...Indian HOT!!  haha...The spice level is CRAZY!!  Love this place!  And although they have raised their prices slightly over the past few years...I do find they have good value for the food they produce!"}
{"text":"When it first opened several years ago, food and service was great. since the new owners took over, the butter chicken is a little different, not really to my liking, however, everything else we tried was great. The naan, is amazing!"}
{"text":"I was recently introduced to Curry N Hurry and I gotta say, it's pretty damn good.

A couple weeks ago I stopped in and ordered some grub to take home. I noticed right away that the prices were reasonable and that the service was excellent.

I ordered the following (and before you judge, know that it wasn't all for me. I was with 4 friends - who happen to all be guys and they eat like it's going out of style). Here's what we got:
- Samosas
- Raita
- Mixed veggie curry
- Aloo Gobhi
- Malai Kofta
- Garlic Naan
- Aloo Naan

Every single dish we got was *awesome*. It was still hot by the time I brought it home and it was perfectly spiced (not too hot, not too mild).

Comin' from a brown person, you know I have a certain amount of clout on this: their food is *good*. Real good.

Order some and taste for yourself ;)"}
{"text":"I am shocked, SHOCKED, to see that Curry N Hurry does not have five stars. It is by far the best Indian food I have had on God's green earth. It's the tastiest food in the history of Hidden Valley. Possibly even the world. 

My dearest Yelp reader, let me give you the best advice you have ever received in your life: Pick up the phone right now. Call Curry N Hurry. Order coconut rice, chicken shahi korma, butter chicken, and naan. Go for pickup. You can see into the kitchen and it's evident just how much care they put into cooking it. It's clearly a family-run business and everything is homemade. 

If you have it in you to trust one random stranger on the internet today, let it be me. You will not regret it. 

P.S. -- The person who left the 1-star review must be deeply confused. My wife and I have ordered food from here probably a dozen times in the last year, and we have never, ever had anything but the best service."}
{"text":"So, Curry 'n' Hurry is exactly what it sounds like: fast, fine food of India!  That about sums it up.

Among their dine-in experience, you can also enjoy their fresh deli bar or take-out and delivery.  The food is reasonably priced and definitely worth every penny.  I was actually surprised at how yummy the food was.  

If Curry 'n' Hurry weren't so far away from my main area of the city I would definitely visit on a regular basis.  The people were nice, the service was fast, and it didn't take all the money from my piggy bank!

Good job, Curry 'n' Hurry!"}
