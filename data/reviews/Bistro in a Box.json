{"text":"I ordered from uber eats. Food was pretty gross. Burger was very thick and not properly cooked with no flavour. Philly cheese was inedible, had to throw it away."}
{"text":"The price is right and the quality is stellar. I work in the neighbourhood and have stopped bringing my lunch. Naheed is a sweetheart and he works his ass off - give him your business."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. Delicious food and very reasonably priced. Love the service too.  I've had a number of yummy dishes here. Most recently the butter chicken.  So far the best I've tasted. Pretty high praise since I've had it at fancier restaurants with way higher price points. I will keep going back for more."}
{"text":"Came here on a beautiful Saturday night with family.  This cozy eatery serves up friendly and fast service.  I ordered the Bistro burger which was delicious! You can customize the ingredients and the cool thing is you can pick the toppings and watch your food being grilled.  The bread on the bun was soft and buttery and this was also toasted.  Ah- finally the fries which was battered.  It was nothing I had in a long time! They also had a small picnic bench outside for extra seating.  If I am back in town- I have to try their own halal items on the menu which had a variety."}
{"text":"Great Butter Chicken... doesnt taste like the jarred stuff most restaurants make all homemade"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great.  Not bad - fries.  Not great - quinoa salad with house dressing. Need more olive oil. It was too acidic, I felt like I was sucking on a lemon. I may as well have because I found a lemon seed in it.  I'll give this place another chance because I want to try their burger. They're lucky their fries are crispy good."}
{"text":"I really like this place. They take the time with their food and have a ton of variety, literally anything you could feel like.  Itd be nice to see less fried foods but everything we got from burger to chicken wrap to fish wrap was really good.  Will def be back."}
{"text":"Friendly, reliable takeout! Great burgers,meat and veggie, and recently tried the butter chicken which was great."}
{"text":"Great quality food nd flavor. Great quality of meat . 16 years of restaurant line I find one of the great place. Halal burger and restaurant one of the best top in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great food and very well priced. Ive had a few meals there and every time Ive throughly enjoyed it.  Staff is always friendly and accomodating. A darkhorse worthy of trying"}
{"text":"The steak and cheese sandwich is so good! And the service was great. They welcome you with such kindness . We were fasting and one of the men went out of his way to serve us extra drinks and some snacks! I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I had the butter chicken with rice here and goodness, it was one of the tastiest dishes I had so far. So delicious. The gravy was excellent and went so well with the rice. The place has a nice ambiance. The quantity of the dish was very good and service was appreciable. This place boasts of a very good menu with prices that don't fall heavy on your wallet. A must visit for sure !!"}
{"text":"The fish wrap and the fish and chips are great deals (especially the $6.50 friday fish and chips special). The fish is very soft and although it looks very dark, it has a nice dill batter. Their best item is probably the salmon brochettes - 4 skewers of grilled salmon with 2 sides (go for the roasted potatoes and veggies). The tartar sauce and the fries are good though. The falafel (both the falafel balls and the tortilla itself) are fairly dry though so it kind of needs to have a lot of sauce on it and a drink. The owner is very friendly too.  However when the online orders pile up, expect some delays. I'd normally rate this a 4 but this place is a nice option in the area and worth more than the low ratings here."}
{"text":"Best guys with the best personalities.  These guys work so incredibly hard and are always there every day, trying to make it better. They care about everyone who comes in and makes sure they get to know everyone.  I work at a club down the street and all of us go there daily to talk and grab their amazing food! We recommend every band that comes through our venue to bistro and basically anyone we talk to, to go to bistro in a box.  Its a gem that I hope only gets more notice and that everyone knows how amazing the owners really are.   If you're reading this review, trust. They are wicked good and just go in and spark a conversation with them. Ask them about cricket and their dreams of fine dining.  Stay gold fellas.  See ya soon!"}
