{"text":"Super cool and chillax place if you are looking for something low key. We had some delicious tea and smoked some hookah and enjoyed the atmosphere. Not alot of main course items on the menus but it was still a good experience."}
{"text":"Really cool vibe.  Sort of a hippie version of snakes and lattes.  They already have a decent collection of games although it Just opened, so expect even more.  Keep an eye out for the Scottish chef! Food was great, i had a lentil soup and Pita with hummus.  Tea selection was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Heard about this place through my work. I was definitely not disappointed... This is simply the most adorable tea house ever, with very friendly staff. They have an incredible tea selection. I especially like their Fairies' Blood: the name picked my curiosity, and the drink did not let me down! They have great food, and very fair prices. It is all vegetarian, with GF and vegan options, and some items can be made GF and/or vegan as well. Game selection is great too. It's also a great place to read/knit/smoke shisha as well, and it's very cozy.

I think it's fair to say I'll be a regular here... And the owners can probably already tell! I'd give this place more than 5 stars if I could!!!"}
{"text":"I am really impressed by this new tea house! The building is so cute on the outside, but there is lots of space inside! 

The decor is really warm and inviting. You can go in find a place to settle and the owners are incredibly friendly and helpful.

I tried the faerie's blood tea and it was full of flavour! This is not your run of the mill tea shop. When you get tea here expect a well crafted tea with depth. There are lots of teas to choose from, I look forward to coming back and trying more!

I had the pita and hummus with a house salad and a decadent chocolate cake. They pay attention to detail even with their food! 

They are starting a Monday night craft circle. I was able to participate and learned some great knitting tips!

I didn't play any games this time, but they seemed to have a great selection. 

I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a Gem in Toronto. Walk in and teleport to a cafe in Morocco, surrounded by calming vibes and aromas. The teas are great here, and many even offer free refills. You also get a large variety of games to play with. It is extremely well priced and the staff is beyond nice. My server explained many of the teas and their origins. Great experience and a must go to for any traveler."}
{"text":"Bampot is awesome! They have a great tea selection and a great game selection. It's super laid back and welcoming."}
{"text":"What a fantastic new teahouse!  I was recently here for a birthday party and instantly fell in love with the place. The owners are young and run the shop themselves. I love the decorations. Especially the little reading nooks. I could spend days here. 

The specialty teas danced on my tongue. They're pricey, but they're delicious and unique. This is no starbucks."}
{"text":"This place is magical, a true hidden gem."}
{"text":"I did not actually go, as when I arrived the place was full. While it looked lovely, the waiter informed us that we should just leave. When we asked whether we had a chance of getting a table later, saying we were ready to wait, he was rude and just reiterated that that there was no table. I felt extremely unwelcome (maybe not bohemian enough) and was actually quite happy to leave the place."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, peaceful atmosphere, and delicious tea. I recommend the chai for two."}
{"text":"Service at Bampot has never been excellent, but when it takes 25 minutes to just get a cup to put water in, that sort of brings it down to a whole new level. 

My boyfriend and I went last night, because I had a craving for their pita and hummus (they put raisins and nuts of some sort in their pita, it's delicious). While we were waiting for our food, we decided that we would like a glass of water. 

Bampot has a tank of water at the front, and you serve yourself. Usually this works out great, but last night when we arrived, they were out of cups. So we asked our server if he could bring some out. He said sure thing... five minutes later, he still hadn't brought them out. We weren't asking for him to do anything particularly time-consuming, we just wanted a vessel to fill with water to drink. 

So we asked another employee (this took awhile, because employees are almost always at the back, not out where the customers are, so we had to wait for someone to come out). She said sure thing, she'd grab some right away... again, no cups. 

Finally, a third employee came out (she's actually one of the co-owners of the place) and we asked her for cups. She was able to provide, for which I was thankful. 

Nonetheless, getting a glass of water should not be a 25 minute process, and for that Bampot has lost a star."}
{"text":"What a gem! There is nothing else like it in the city. Easily my new favourite place.

ATMOSPHERE - Outstanding atmosphere! So cozy and colourful, the Morrocan-themed and earthy-inspired decor is so well selected, with great attention to detail. There are a variety of seating options - from seated platforms, to the standard table & chairs, to armchairs and couches. 

TEA - They have more than 50 teas of all kinds of varieties - including specialty blends with hand-blended herbs and seasonings - which come by the pot at reasonable prices (which vary depending on the tea). Give yourself some time with the tea menu! It will tempt you in all different directions.

FOOD - Plenty of options to nosh on. Daily main, usually a curry, and a daily soup. Nice selection of both savoury and sweet snacks. All at decent prices. I had the best chocolate cake I've ever had! Check out the much-loved Bampot original: poutine soup!

GAMES - Good selection of board games! Nicely organized and categorized in the board game library. 

* Bonuses * 
- HOOKAHS - Tobacco-free shisha in many flavours! 
- ACCESSIBILITY - Barrier-free entrance (ramp to doorway) and barrier-free washroom on main floor.
- Such a great place to bring DATES!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, relaxing atmosphere. The owners and servers are welcoming and very helpful if you're not sure what kind of tea you want.

LIFE DRAWING sessions in the back room on Sundays!!!!!"}
{"text":"This a truly wonderful addition to the Toronto cafe scene.  The decor is whimsical and warm, seating options are varied (they have raised platforms with cushions and rugs) board game selection is good and of course, the tea selection is outstanding and the owners are such sweet people.

Their lemongrass chai was magical on a cool night.  Will absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute place - was taken here on a date.  Cozy little areas to sit and the staff is really friendly.  They have an excellent selection of tea's and board games - could sit there for hours! Definitely recommend this place when you've got lots of time and good people around."}
{"text":"The food is consistently healthy, tasty, & well-made, the tea is always delicious, & the atmosphere is lovely. I've spent many afternoons & evenings here since it opened, & will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere, relaxing, good food, great tea. I really enjoyed my experience here. Some reviews on here mentioned slow/bad service but that wasn't the case for me at all. I will admit though that some of the charm for me relies on nostalgia. It reminds me of growing up in the early 90s and being carefree while playing board games. The bohemian decor certainly helped as well."}
{"text":"The place only opened a few weeks ago and is lovely, eclectic and low key. They have all sorts of tasty teas, adorable teapots and an intriguing menu (Poutine soup you say? why yes, it IS fantastic!).  The vibe is cozy and bohemian and everyone I've brought there so far has loved it!

This is not a place to grab and dash, but rather bring a notebook and/or friends and have a lovely afternoon/evening.  The owners are friendly, fun, and accommodating and just generally great people to hang out with.  See the other reviews for more detail on teas and food, I can't recommend strongly enough!"}
{"text":"The most zen place I've been to in Toronto - I could spend all day here!

Time has never felt so slow, nor have I ever felt so relaxed in a restaurant/cafe. Once you enter, you take your shoes off, grab a menu from the front table walk around barefoot to explore which seat to choose. You're open to choose any seating, from tables to outdoor benches to booths where you sit crosslegged. They encourage you to take your time in the tea room and to peruse the menu, which I love. They also offer boardgames, but we didn't play any during our visit.

The tea selection here is AMAZING; there are so many options and unique blends - the menu explains all of their teas in depth. Based on what we were feeling, we were recommended the Bam Bam Chai (a milkier, sweet chai) and the Sencha Kyoto Cherry Rose with lemongrass and lavender (a light green tea with hints of floral). Both teas were soooo good! The Bam Bam Chai was sweetened a bit too much for our liking, but still so smooth and deliciously rich. The Sencha Kyoto Cherry Rose was perfectly light and had delicious, subtle notes. 

As for food, I ordered the tuxedo cake (very good with light teas, but too sweet with the Bam Bam Chai) and the pita with hummus. The pita was a nice soft, chewy texture and was served warm, which was really nice. 

Tip: If you get tired or need a change of scenery from where you're seated, you can just move and sit anywhere else! Also, if you're unsure what to get, ask the servers and they'll ask you a series of what you're feeling and give you a recommendation (super knowledgable and a fun way to explore teas!) 

Note: The price list is at the back of the menu with all the items and their prices listed."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you could really love it or really hate it. I wasn't a fan of this place as I wasn't feeling the vibe of it. I pictured a games room, but it's more of a lounging tea room (albeit, there are tons of games you could actually play here). Oh and you have to leave your shoes by the door. If you're into teas and zen like places, this is definitely the place for you. If you're anything like me, and are just looking for a snakes and lattes kind of atmosphere to play games in, don't come here."}
{"text":"Bampot is a very unique Tea shop. It offers a HUGE range of different types of tea and amazing interior. You can also play board games if you wish to, and there are is usually a small selection of food. The main weakness is the service. I have been here twice and both times I had to either wait a long time to be served or go find a server myself. The problem is that you need to grab your own menu (which is fine) but then because of that they don't keep track of who comes in."}
{"text":"I came here the other night with a big group of people and we had a really nice time. When you first walk in, the restaurant asks you to please take off your shoes. Word of advice: It's a great idea to wear socks if you don't want to use the slippers provided by the restaurant and if you want to leave with clean feet.  I'm a bit of a germaphobe, so I wasn't too thrilled about taking off my shoes.

From afar, the restaurant looks small but once you are inside, you realize it is much bigger.  The venue has tons of seating and a bohemian-like ambiance. Bampot provides guests with little nooks where they can relax in a comfortable environment. The nooks have carpeting and pillows for you to just lounge. They also have some traditional table settings as well. The idea is to make you feel at home. 

The restaurant also has a room with shelving and tons of games available for play. We didn't play any games on this night but it was nice to know we had the option. 

The menu is also pretty awesome! Bampot can accommodate vegans and people who are gluten and/or lactose intolerant. Talk about a win!

I shared a vegan cheesecake with a friend and it was the best gluten and dairy free cheesecake I have ever had!  I would revisit Bampot just to have another slice of the blueberry cheesecake.  While there, I also tried the gluten and dairy free stew and falafels. Both dishes tasted amazing! I especially liked the falafels. 

Now onto the tea (the real reason we came here). Bampot has an extensive tea menu. They have tons of teas for you to choose from including some featured teas such as Unicorn Blood. It sounds disgusting but it is oh so amazing. My friend bought it and it was delicious. 

Later in the evening, I described the type of tea I was craving to the waitress and she created a tea blend that wasn't on the menu just for me. The tea tasted amazing and everyone in our group tried it and loved it as well. Of course, I had to ask the waitress what she did and she told me she blended strawberry kiwi and apple cider tea. This combination is so amazing, you'll have to try it!!

I highly recommend this restaurant café and believe you will love it too."}
{"text":"The vibe of the place was super chill. I went there tonight to have tea with a couple of friends. There was a good band playing and that was really nice. The tea was great. Especially now that it's getting hotter I highly recommend the iced tea. My friends and I had to keep getting it coming, I'm still craving more as I write this. 
The place was clean and the service was very fast despite the waiter attending so many tables and the room being so hectic. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I highly recommend every one check this cafe out!! it has bohemian atheistic inside, very comfortable, colorful, and transporting! WIDE assortment of teas to choose from which comes in a pot. Bampot has separate seating arrangements in the cafe where you can either sit in a table with chairs or on a tatami style arrangement with generous offer of cushions and pillows. These tatami has a air of seclusion which is ideal for personal conversations! Have vegan dishes (including dessert)."}
{"text":"Pink Floyd and David Bowie as music background in a mind-relaxing tea house is just unique. Close your eyes and relax."}
{"text":"A little gem in Toronto! Was surprised the second I stepped in bc you can take your shoes off and wear slippers (apparently you can also keep your shoes on if it's summer). 

Someone in an alcove was singing along to her guitar when we arrived. It was magical. 

We were told that we could explore the space and make ourselves comfortable wherever we liked. The owner came by and spent quite a while telling us about how he prepared his Bam Bam Chai, his ice teas, how he got the idea for Bampot. 

The curry we ordered was delicious. It tasted quite wholesome. I was surprised by how good the iced green tea was. It had a light lychee flavour (?) which made the tea perfect for summer.

Bampot also has a selection of boardgames which you can play at 1 boardgame for $3 (if you order a main). 

The only downside here is the wait for food. It's definitely not the place to go to if you're in a rush. 

Overall, it has a really special ambiance. Would definitely recommend checking it out if you're into teas and relaxing spaces with a Bohemian vibe."}
{"text":"This is my first review ever. Yes, I am being *that person*. Went there last night, the service was lacking, to say the least. The waiter was too busy to come to our table so the service was ridiculously slooooow as well he kept forgetting our order. Beyond that he told us they served fresh in-house felafel and hummus which is a lie. The felafels are warmed-up Yves felafels (I've bought them before) and the hummus was also store made, as well not a good hummus. For the price and wait it was not worth it. As well there was an earwig in the bathroom and terrible poetry about cats, porn, and suicide."}
{"text":"Incredible prices and awesome selection of tea, with a selection unlike anything you can find at stabucks or david's tea. I really enjoyed the Tibetan lavender tea. They also have hookah and board games. I love the sitting arrangement and the decor of this place and how intimate the place feels. I also love how the menu is entirely vegetarian and has vegan options. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. Location is close to Bathurst station. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I wish I heard about this place earlier! Great time especially in the winter seasons to stop by for a visit. It is heated inside with lots of cozy places for you to relax with a nice hot cup of tea. 

It looks pretty small from the outside, but once you're in, it is pretty spacey. You will need to take off your shoes and leave them near the door, so definitely remember to wear socks!! You are then to grab a menu and a server will find you later on and help you with anything. We sat in a corner with lots of pillows and a beautiful carpet. The area we were was also heated so it was very comfortable.

The service was really friendly and helpful as it was our first time visiting the tea house. We asked for suggestions and they recommended us a fruity tea which I absolutely already forgot the name of. However, it was delicious and had fresh fruit inside. We also got carrot cake, and it was surprisingly not sweet at all, it was delicious! They also got a lot of vegan options and they seem to be pretty accommodating with everything. The prices also seem pretty reasonable. 

We also played board games, it is $5 per person or $3 if you ordered something from their main menu. They got a lot of variety to choose from so that's pretty cool. 

It seems to get busy later in the day, so visit earlier! I definitely recommend this place to come with friends or even alone if you want to write or read a book."}
{"text":"Oh my god. This place is...just no.

Let's start off with approaching the place. I get that it's Harbord St. in Toronto, but really? It looks like a run down shack with a sign. Entering, you see some art; some is quite nice, and the idea to support young local artists is excellent, but do I REALLY need to see a FOUR ARMED WOMAN WITH HER ENTRAILS FALLING OUT OF HER while I eat and sip tea?! I think NOT! Absolutely TACKY décor from the 1950s, this place needs to be vacated and renovated with a nuclear weapon.

The tea: You would think that, being a teahouse and all, that they'd have a tea list on their website, but they don't. First strike. Second strike? The tea is frigid. The water is always lukewarm to ice cold. Third strike? It tastes gross. The fairy's blood tea (what a morbid name, gross!) tastes as though it was created by Paula Deen on psilocybins. It's like...liquid soap with some weeds from the garden, it's FOUL. And don't go \"teehee my tea is organic and has x, y, z as health benefits,\" because they do not. They're teas, not magic. They do not heal you or help anything but quench thirst, or scald a tongue. In this case, they ruin your day.

The food: while some of it does indeed appear nice, their menu is really all over the place! You don't go from \"poutine soup\" (Yes, it's as disgusting as it sounds. It's watery gravy with half-baked potatoes, and stringy white cheese), to baklava and sahlep! Speaking of which, REALLY? If you're going to serve food from another culture, it better be spot-on, otherwise this is just some wannabe crap that's insulting. Unfortunately, it falls into the latter category, and it's offensive. You sahlep should not be dirty dishwater, and your baklava should not be some frozen, store-bought nonsense! Unacceptable! And RESELLING CHEERIOS? CHEERIOS? GET OUT! OUT, OUT, OUT!

Removing shoes at the door sounds cute in retrospect, but quite frankly, I don't want to smell other people's nasty shoes! 

Service was rude, and the workers only talked to white people like myself. The Arab girls in the place were completely ignored, despite being paying customers. This place is honestly like a gentrification cafe, it's just disappointing.

The store's house should read \"MONDAY THROUGH SUNDAY: CLOSED!\""}
{"text":"TLDR; this place is a total hidden gem. Being at Bampot feels like spending an afternoon at your favourite Grandma's house. Order the sharing snack plate!

Came here on a rainy Saturday and this place could not be more perfect. It beats all the other board game cafes in the city. 

FOOD: We ordered the ballad salad, the shared snack plate and the homemade chai tea. I couldn't pick a favourite if you forced me. They have a huge, high quality tea menu and a good selection of foods and desserts.

Ballad Salad: garlicky, nutty, and fresh. It's a simple salad but the ginger garlic dressing is to die for. 

Sharing Plate: Nuts & Bolts, Cheese & Crackers, Hummus & Pita. All ingredients are high quality, fresh and simple. Very well done. 

Chai Tea: milky, spicy and sweet. Comes in a lovely clay pot and warms you up. 

ATMOSPHERE 
We sat on a raised platforms on pillows with our shoes off. Very unique, and great atmosphere for playing games. There are also regular tables if that's more your style. 

They have about 100+ board games and a large selection of books. We played Pandemic (the BEST 2 person game) & Mr. Jack."}
{"text":"Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe how I feel about my last visit to Bampot. When I walked in it was a lot dingier than I remember. We had initially sat on a table, and then moved to one of the cushioned alcoves by the window because it looked cozy. Unfortunately, they were very dusty and even had hair balls scattered around (one of them stuck onto my friend's shoe that she had taken off and placed off to the side). It looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in a long time. After noticing the hairballs we moved to a table nearby that looked like it hadn't even been wiped down. My friend asked the waitress if she'd be kind enough to bring a wet towel for her to clean it with (she didn't even ask her to do it) and she came back and brought us paper napkins. 

When the waitress came to get our order we asked whether ice teas were available. She told us that any tea could be made into \"iced tea\". Other than that she didn't have much knowledge about the teas since she was new. We ordered the dreamsicle iced tea, blueberry tea, and earl grey tea with a splash of milk. For food we got the savoury platter ($17.50) and a side salad. 

I'll start with the tea. It was all very watered down. I've ordered the dreamsicle every time I've been to Bampot and it's never tasted like that before. The teapot wasn't even filled to the top. The blueberry tea tasted like water. As an avid tea drinker, I'm aware that fruit teas usually have a lighter taste but this had very little taste to it. My friend's earl grey tea tasted like (her words) \"tim horton's tea that had been left to sit out cold\". We were so upset that we had contemplated leaving but unfortunately had to wait for the food. The tea cups and teapots were also all chipped and didn't look like they were in good shape. 

When the food finally came out, the platter was a sad imitation of a cheese/hummus plate. I looked at the pictures on yelp and mine didn't look anything like those ones, not to mention it didn't even have grapes. For something that's nearly $20 you'd think they'd be nice to include a bit more than a couple morning rounds cut up, hummus, crackers, cubes of cheese, and ¼ of a cucumber. 

The washroom also smelled strongly of urine and there was no paper towels. 

Sadly, I won't be coming back. I used to love Bampot but now it's just one those places that has been left to new employees who don't seem to care."}
{"text":"What a surprising, wonderful find. I had walked by this place so many times, vaguely curious but never venturing in. I'm so glad I did. It's like walking into Narnia, skylights and cozy nooks built out of pillows and lovely wood, plants everywhere. Huge tea menu, $5 + seems pricey for a cup of tea at first, but they're actually served in beautiful hand made pots that keep the tea at a perfect hot temperature with enough to sit and sip for a couple of hours. I never partook in the food or the board games while I was there ( though I appreciate that there isn't a cover for anyone who walks in like some games cafes. They only charge if you decide to play) but the food menu looked great and I'm excited to go back and sample it. Thanks for creating an oasis in the annex guys, I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We went to Bampot on a Friday to meet up, drink some tea, have some snacks and spend endless hours playing obscure board games. Of those things, they hit 2/3. Board games were a ton of fun and the selection was great. We spent about 5.5 hours there and actually made it within 15 minutes of closing at about 1:30am. The tea selection is also pretty extensive; some of the teas are also hand blended/mixed in-house and may take a bit longer to prepare. I had the Bazaar blend (hand mixed) and it was excellent. The right balance of a strong black tea with a unique mixture of spices including saffron that brought a nice twist. 

The downsides now. While the tea was good, the snacks were just okay. And we tried quite a few of them. Vegetarian curry, peppermint chocolate cake, boterkoek, hummus and salad and bowl of bits and bites (kind of like a trail mix). None of those were great and worth ordering again in my eyes. But it's good to have some snacks while indulging in the tea and games. 

Another downside was the service - VE-RY SLOW. It's a good thing the board games kept us distracted. Other than that, the seating is comfy and cafe is very Bohemian inspired. I thought it was a nice surprise to find out some of the art work on display can be purchased.

Overall, would recommend Bampot for a fun night of board games and great tea!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome. My new favorite place.  Cozy comfortable welcoming... Perfect place to work or write or for a date or  meeting someone. Love it. So many teas too!!!"}
{"text":"This place is heaven for the lover of tea, who is tired of going to cafes and ordering some bland unpalatable tea-bag beverage, while their friends gush about their blah-blah-something-latte. The atmosphere is relaxing and cozy and social, the tea selection is wonderful, and the owners are a great combination of laid-back, friendly, and yet serious about their business. They clearly view the place as a community-building hub. A couple of the staff are inconsistent and bring the cafe down, but please give Bampot another chance, if you happened to fall upon an aloof or surly employee.  
Finally, it's nice that their menu accommodates vegans and GF diets, but the food isn't good or diverse, so don't come here for dinner. Come for the fantastic tea and a chat, or a light board-game with old and new friend(s)."}
{"text":"This is a chilling haven! you know the times when you just want to sip on tea, sit crosslegged on a persian rug with a book or play board games with friends. The time when you don't want to eat but nibble on your favorite popcorn and hummus dip!! This is it, friends this is the place for you. The staff are fantastic too I want to steal their outfits and their accent ( you get the picture!) very bohemian is what I am trying to say. The hookha here is tobacco free yet full of flavour seriously the best I have had and I have had way too many from the Mid East to Mexico. I didn't feel sick after also the price is great $13. Popcorn was sadly soggy but the tea made up for it ...how is it possible to get one type of tea here?!!! Even after spending 15 minutes deciding!"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite place in Toronto. It isn't somewhere you go for dinner, although it has very good food. Go here to lounge with friends, play board games, enjoy the casual ambience, and drink amazing tea."}
{"text":"This place so gross. They make me take off shoes? I try for a bit and walk around but it smells so bad of feet and B.O everywhere. I needed to go back to the door and catch air. 

Whole thing feel like prostitution ring! Creepy, smelly and people lying around in beds everywhere. Slacked and droopy eyed. I was getting afraid. 

I ask hostess for a seat 3 times and she says \"you can sit of the floor or someones lap\". THATS NOT WHY I COME OUTSIDE TO SOCIALIZE AND CONNECT WITH HIM AND FRIENDS. 

Me and my man left. Sad night. 

I hope I didn't get bed bugs."}
{"text":"This is an update based on recent experiences with the service and food. I've been to Bampot 7 or 8 times now, and the service is consistently slow, aloof, and is dangerously bordering on bad. The most notable offences have been delivering tea with a TEN MINUTE delay to getting cups (with no staff to be found the entire time) and the incomprehensible water policy. Bampot staff won't get you water (in fact, they flat out refuse), and direct you instead to a water pitcher and glasses by the front desk. While this is okay in theory, it becomes a disaster in practice because the pitcher is always empty or there are no cups available. Mix this with the staff's propensity to disappear, and you're looking at long wait times to get water. If they want to continue this help yourself to water policy, they need a bigger pitcher or cooler and they need to be diligent about replacing cups. Aside from these two main problems, the staff do nothing to make you feel welcome and are actually quite rude. The food is also quite bad (e.g., poutine soup is waaaaay too salty), although the carrot cake and bits and bites are excellent. I wish they could get their service and food act together, because the potential here is high. Board games and tea selection are still great."}
{"text":"Let me be the devil's advocate and just say that this cafe blows. In all my years of reviewing, this takes the cake as one of the worst places I've been to. 

PROS:
+SEATING: Comfy, somewhat spacious. The have little seating areas with pillows that look really comfortable to play board games in.

CONS: 
- FOOD: My spicy peanut soup was neither spicy nor soup-y. It was basically rice with vegetables and some peanut sauce drenched on the rice. So disappointing. I also didn't order a salad, but was happy because I thought it came with my $9 meal. I learned afterwards that they made a mistake which I realized at the cashier. Reluctantly, the cashier took the salad charge off my bill but she made the most horrendous gestures. 

She slammed the interact machine in my face and ultimately did not look pleased. Even if she wasn't being the best cashier, there's something called BASIC HUMAN FUCKING DECENCY. So rude. 

The food selection is both limiting and ultimately disappointing. The pita bread was yummy though, and sweet, but not worth $9 as part of any entree set. Looking at my friends' meals all around, nothing truly appealed to me. 

Ultimately, I recommend Bampot if you're a tea connoisseur. If not, go somewhere else where your consumerism is more valued."}
{"text":"I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Bampot. It's amazing in so many different ways.

Bampot's selection of board games is like it's selection of teas: vast and awesome.

They have their board games split up into sections (strategy, casual, etc.), and in your menu will come a sheet with the board games listed into sections, with the average playtime per game listed, too. Since Bampot is brand new, the board games are too! I broke open seasons to find that the game hadn't been played yet since the cards were still in their packages! No ratty old board games here!

The cover fee to play board games is $5 if you don't eat, $3 if you do.

There are, I believe, over 70 different teas you can try here. I'm not a big tea person, but I sipped some of my friends teas (apple mint, and faerie's blood), and they were both delicious (especially the faerie's blood, which is steeped with not only the tea but fresh fruit also.) Many of the teas also have free refills :)

They have a non-tea menu for people like myself, with items like Maple Milk & Hot Chocolate. I paid about $3 for not just a cup but a POT of DELICIOUS hot chocolate - some pretty great value there.

The food kicks some serious butt too. I gorged on Poutine SOUP (yep, it IS as amazing as it sounds), Chocolate Strawberry Cake (chocolatety, decadent, delicious), and a yummy yummy \"posh\" cheese board.

The staff are extremely nice, they are happy to chat, help you wade through the giant tea menu, provide both tea and board game reccomendations, and more.

The decor is also cozy and adorable. It gives off the feeling of playing board games and/or enjoying some tea in a friend's living room.

There is also shisha available, a Monday Night Craft Circle, and other events in the works.

I can't wait to come back. I will definitely be returning. What a gem!"}
{"text":"I am really sad about having to write this review, but I feel like I have to since the latest reviews don't really seem to reflect what's happened to the place. I used to be this place's biggest fan, always raving about it my friends (and even strangers!) but today I was really disappointed and I don't think I'll be going again.

A friend and I came in today and we were surprised by a giant hanging shoe rack-- while fine in theory, people's feet smell, and having several stacked up right by the door was not a great idea considering the place is already narrow. I also noticed that there was a significant lack of lighting, and artwork.

We weren't even given any menus, but were told to grab a couple ourselves from a basket. That was really strange since normally you're given one as soon as you're seated, but I was willing to look past it. The new menus are very hard to go through, so I stuck to the old menu that's been around for years, and picked out a tea. One of the employees suggested something else, and after we agreed to try it, he went off to the back and sang while he made us our tea. It took him a long time to get back to us, passing back and forth while chatting to others, letting us know that he'd be \"several minutes.\" We didn't get our order taken til 15 minutes after sitting down, but we did get our tea quickly once he had a minute. The weird thing is, though, that one of the owners was there, and he was just lounging around.

The tables were sticky, but the employee who sat us down ran off to grab some napkins to clean up. After we got our drinks, we felt like we were unwelcome. The owner didn't even acknowledge us but literally took the time to greet everyone else who walked in. We were also ignored for the entire time we were there, so we ended up deciding to cut our visit short and just pay for the one pot of tea. We left without anyone acknowledging us (after paying), and both my friend and I felt really uncomfortable and like people were being hostile towards us.

We did notice the demographic changed a lot from when we would go in-- there didn't actually seem to be very many people in, but the people who were in were performers for the event happening later on that evening. I always went to Bampot for the atmosphere and the people, but now it seems like those have deteriorated as well. The food was never that great (though I've always loved their sahleb), the service is dangerously close to bad, there seems to be a newly developed hostility to people who don't fit the Bampot \"type,\" and the new seating is really uncomfortable and cramped in the back. The tea is very good, and it always has been, but it wouldn't be hard to find another place to pop in to.

I really hope they get their shit together, I loved this place in the past and it's just so sad seeing what it's become now."}
{"text":"Came here for games and tea with a friend. Super cozy and hippie feeling, which I loved. 

Their game selection is okay, with lots of well known games, but nothing too out of the ordinary. 

Tea selection is amazing! Not your weird new age tea flavours, more of a subtle spin on classic teas (which I like a lot better than your new cotton candy, or birthday cake type flavours). 

The owners and super friendly too."}
{"text":"I am all about ambience and vibes and Bampot really has that aspect down. It's very bohemian/hippie, with carpeted window seats, comfy cushions, and mismatched cups and teapots. Great for Instagram photos (though you don't get the impression they're super into the annoying white girl doin' it for the gram thing). 

It's very relaxed and they encourage you to do whatever you want there - art, read, chat with friends, play an instrument etc. They also have a selection of board games you can play for a fee. 

The tea selection is amazing, with so many different kinds of teas with interesting names like Unicorn's Blood. They also serve a few light snacks and a main of the day, which when I was there was a chickpea sweet potato curry. Food options tend to be healthy, gluten free, vegan etc."}
{"text":"Very cozy and eclectic place. Great customer service. The place is owned by a Scot man who wears his kilt proudly. When I came in the place on a Tuesday night, it was full. Understandable as it's a unique tea house. I can see why people come there just to read and hang. I'll probably not be returning though as the quality and tea making technique was not very high. Whether one chooses a Chinese, Indian or Russian tea etc, it's all brewed in a largish pot and served in a bowl cup. Blasphemy! I therefore await camellia sinensis to branch out from Montreal and show Toronto how to best showcase various teas. Till then I guess I won't be drinking tea out in Toronto"}
{"text":"This place tries to be comfy and homey but in reality it is gross. They make you take off your shoes and the whole place smells and looks like a mess."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer so I could hang out here - they're serious about their teas - I tried two and both were nice. I also really like the neo-Moroccan decor which divides the place into a variety of cozy nooks and the board games are a nice touch (though they could branch out into more \"hardcore\" board games) and the relaxed, friendly atmosphere. Wish I hadn't eaten lunch before arriving so I could tell you about the food..."}
{"text":"Wide selections of tea including caffeine-free teas. They also offer lots of vegan choices. 

The atmosphere is very relaxed and bohemian-like, great place to hang out with friends or read a book for an entire afternoon. People who work here are always patient and nice."}
{"text":"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Heartache of heartaches, THEY HAVE CHANGED THEIR FALAFEL recipe. Their old-school falafel patty, which was basically an angel sent from heaven in chickpea patty form is now a less flavorful, balled, ugly stepsister version of the original. Makes my soul cry :'( It's still alright, but I long for the days of yore when the Scottish owner chef-guy made them from scratch.

REST IN POWER FALAFEL PATTY.

Still love the place as always. They've got a rotation of new lovely servers and service has gone up just enough for me to not find any issues. Yes, it's still a little slow at times, but I was there for over 3 hours sipping away and studying and I was impressed that I was checked up on a few times (huge difference from before.) The one server who had given me a touch of attitude is now gone and it's softened the vibe visibly. 

It was really lively on the Sunday afternoon I visited, a huge ASL group took up the front space signing away with vigor, to the right of me, a nuclear family quietly enjoyed tea, while university students kept the back jumping.

I live down the road from here and basically use Bampot as my second home."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. They opened two weeks ago and I've already been a few times. Amazing tea selection, really wonderful and comfortable decor, and a huge selection of board games. The games are also sorted by type, and there's a detailed list included with the menu to help you choose (it lists the time to play and number of players). The service is friendly, the prices reasonable, and, again, the tea selection impressive. Highly recomend."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place in Toronto. I'm so happy that such a unique, comfortable tea place exists! They have something like 80 different teas on the menu, and the cutest little nooks with cushions to lounge on while you hang out and relax. Equally awesome place for a fun get-together or a comfy, quiet study session. Love it so much! :)"}
{"text":"Service is slow, but friendly staffs. Nice place that you should take your shoes off and great location for playing board games."}
{"text":"When I first heard about Bampot through social media, I knew I had to check it out and bring my boyfriend along. We both love tea and board games so it was the perfect combination. We went to check it out a couple of weeks after it opened. 

The environment of the cafe definitely suits the name. The cafe is decorated with yellow, orange, and dark red walls, reminding me of the Indian culture. There are some areas where you can sit in the nooks and crannies of the cafe with only pillows and drapes, giving off that bohemian vibe. The space gives a lot of intimacy compared to most places I have been to; which is nice and unique to Bampot. 

Bampot serves a vast selection of tea, some with free refills. Like most places, it has a $5 sitting fee if you would like to play the board games. However, it only costs $3 if you decide to order food. My boyfriend got the soup of the day, which was some sort of Thai curry soup the owners whipped up. He absolutely loved it and I enjoyed it as well. It had that spicy flavour that curry lovers would be familiar with. I had the Quangzhou Milk Oolong tea, which tasted exactly what you would expect a milk tea would taste like. It wasn't my favourite, but I didn't mind drinking it either. For each pot of tea you receive, you get a timer as well, so you know when the tea is perfectly steeped. Between my boyfriend and I, we pretty much drained all the hot water they had for our free refills haha.

There are currently about 160 games available and when I was there, many of them were unopened. My boyfriend was in heaven for a short period of time after I found a brand new Firefly board game towards the end of our stay. Unfortunately it was a two hour game and we were already there for about two to three hours. He sadly had to wave goodbye to it.

The cafe hosts different events here and now. They have Scrabble Night on Mondays and free knitting lessons often. They planned on having a Dungeons and Dragons game night as well. The owners said that they were looking for games to host events for. If you are a game enthusiast and would like to bring an event to Bampot, definitely reach out to them!

Overall, I highly recommend Bampot. It's so good that it's now my boyfriend's favourite board game place, knocking Snakes and Lattes to his second favourite. This is definitely a great date location to spend with your significant other. Also if you are a tea enthusiast, it is a must to visit! The cafe is very intimate and cozy with such a lovely staff. I don't recommend coming in with a large group of friends unless you are willing to break the group down. It's best to have no more than three (or at most four) other friends with you because of the space. The cafe also has hookah available as well."}
{"text":"FOOD: Bampot offers a good selection of vegan and non-vegan options to satisfy your sugar craving. I've yet to try their Baklava. Their vegan cheesecake is superb. However, you don't go to Bampot to eat. You go there to enjoy one of their myriad of teas.

TEAS: Bampot offers some of the best selection of teas in the GTA IMHO. My all-time favourite is the Desi Chai (Indian Masala Chai). It's creamy and flavourful. A pot for one person was enough for 3-4 cups. I was impressed. Whatever kind of tea you like, you will find it at Bampot.

SERVICE: The service was courteous and friendly. Your waiter will be happy to advise you on the best tea according to your preferences.

AMBIANCE: This place is not your typical cosmopolitan, hipster-ish tea house. It feels more hippy-ish, more relaxed, more communal, than commercial. It's a gathering spot for all kinds of people who come to Bampot to have a good time. Bampot is not for those seeking the next \"hot\" coffee / tea house in the neighbourhood. It's for those who want to enjoy a cup of good tea and have a relaxed conversation with their friend or partner.

I know I'll be back at Bampot soon for another teapot of Desi Chai."}
{"text":"My girlfriend really wanted to try this place out, so we finally did this week and I really enjoyed our time there! 

Admittedly, reading the reviews made me a little cautious and I'm really glad that they didn't reflect our experience. I don't understand at all what people mean when they say it smells bad in here. It smelled strongly like tea and incense (aka good). It didn't smell like feet or body odor at all. 

We tried their Creamed Earl Grey tea which was delicious with soy milk, but a bit too astringent for me on its own. We also had the posh cheese and crackers, a slice of carrot cake, and halva. All were delicious, if a bit on the pricey side, but nothing unexpected from any similar joint, really. I see from other reviews that the food presentation/quality isn't always consistent, so that's a bit disappointing--but for us, and for this visit, it was lovely.

Staff were very friendly and approachable, service was great. They have a sign that mentions taking off your shoes and using supplied slippers, but I chose to keep my shoes on and they didn't give me any trouble at all about it. We didn't have specific questions about teas/the menu, but other customers did and I overheard staff being very thorough about answering and providing suggestions, which is always nice. Very cozy, chill atmosphere. 

We did play a couple games, and if you're going to do that, I'd suggest probably staying away from the couches just because the way seating/tables are placed can make gameplay tricky since you're usually not sitting directly across from each other. 

There were only two cons for me. 
- Menu: great at giving lengthy and detailed descriptions of their tea, but also really insist on using \"ancient\" Chinese proverbs. It's okay! Something can just be a Chinese proverb! It doesn't have to be ancient because it's Chinese! Especially when they don't use the same descriptor for the other proverbs they put in. Also, price list is at the very back, instead of just beside the tea description, etc. It's quite a long menu, so that was a bit annoying. 

- Decor: some of the furniture (basically just the couches, the wooden sets seemed fine) did look a bit like they've been through some wear and tear, but that's not a dealbreaker for me. 

Overall, I'd come back!"}
{"text":"I've visited twice so far, and it's my favourite new haunt. The tea selection is astounding, and the \"posh crackers and cheese\" make a nice snack, too. There's a nice, diverse board game selection, and they're categorized by genre, difficulty, duration, and number of players, which is very helpful when choosing. Extremely cozy atmosphere, and the owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night for a date and scored a lovely nook where we got to play games and recline on pillows to chat. Very chill atmosphere and the moroccon mint tea I had was lovely. They have an extensive tea list so there is sure to be something for everyone. My date had a salad which he said was fine and I had the daily curry which was a lentil sweet potato curry. The curry was decent but the pita that it came with was the star for me, it was chewy with raisins that was a sweet contrast to the curry. Overall, I really liked the atmosphere and after 9ish it started getting quite packed. I would definitely come back for a visit!"}
{"text":"This place is so unique and unlike anywhere else I've ever been! The best word that comes to mind is cozy: this place is just so warm and cozy, and would be a great place to chill on a chilly fall or winter day. I came on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 4 other friends around 1 PM - it was pretty quiet when we first came in, but was a lot fuller when we left about 2 hours later. I love the decor in this place, there are so many colours and different pieces (carpets, curtains, tapestries, pillows) and it's so fun and eclectic, this place just has so much character. It is pretty accomodating for groups of various sizes, although I probably wouldn't come with a group larger than 5 or 6. We sat on some couches around a little coffee table, but it looked like most of the other seating areas were meant to fit groups of 2 or 3. I didn't actually look at the board game selection, but my group ended up playing one that I've never heard of before, so that was fun.

They have an extensive tea selection - I had the honey spice tea and it was kind of like a chai tea but a little bit sweeter and less cinnamon-y. I also had a salad and added a side of pita and hummus. The pita was so good, it was so thick and soft, and my only complaint here would be that there wasn't more. The salad was also pretty good, it had a lot of stuff in it like cashews and the vinagrette is house-made and very flavourful. Vegetarians will be happy to note that all the food options here are vegetarian and most are also vegan. My meal ended up being $18 after tax.

I can definitely see myself coming back here, even if it's just to chill and chat with some friends. I saw lots of small groups nestled in these little nooks all around the place, and some people had even brought knitting supplies with them. It looked so cozy!"}
{"text":"\"Interesting\" is definitely the word I would use to describe Bampot House of Tea & Board Games. If you know me, you would likely notice my clutch word or filler word is \"interesting\". I use the word to describe situations that are different, uncomfortable or fascinating. Often, I use the word when I do not know how to respond or to fill the gap (that may otherwise be a silent void). 

Bampot House of Tea & Board Games, I would say embodies the word \"interesting\". It is truly where people from different worlds collide. It feels like a mutli-verse - one corner of the room may have people jamming with guitar, the other  corner is filled with people enjoying board games, somewhere in a hidden corner is a person quietly working hard on their project. At times, you may overhear conversations related to overcoming limiting beliefs, provoking spiritual awakening or just waves after waves of laughter.

Even the password of the wifi is contemplative - \"maybe there is more to life, maybe not\".

The food at Bampot is earnest, poignant and hearty. There is something special about a bowl of hot soup, hearty stew or sincere curry to warm you up from the inside and out on a cold day. My soup of the day, Spicy beet with chickpea soup ($7.50) was full of warmth. It was accompanied by simple toast and coconut butter. Vegetarian rejoice.All the food served at Bampot are vegetarian friendly!

There are also endless selections of teas for every flavor profile. Different tea for different peeps! My favourite at Bampot is surprisingly not tea; it is the dark hot chocolate with housemade almond milk. It was the perfect soulful drink with a hint of sweetness. The white pot and cup with silver embossed lace even matches my OOTD (outfit of the day). It must mean we are meant to be! ;) 

Sitting in a small booth alone at Bampot, surrounded by rustic cushion with a warm bowl of soup and observing life is the wonderful way to spend a quiet evening."}
{"text":"I come here with friends all the time for board games! I love the Bam Bam Chai and all their desserts! (We once got the Sweet Treat platter and every single thing was DELICIOUS.) I also love the Ballad Salad, the falafels, and their delicious raisin pita! The specials are usually great, but the one time I didn't like it, they took it back and didn't charge me for it.

The board game selection is really great and often the management will come back and check out what we're playing and see how we like it. 

The only downside is the service can be pretty hit or miss. I'm not sure if this is because we normally sit in the back, but we often have to hunt someone down to make an order and sometimes the we'll get a dessert before our main! haha. 

If you have a lazy afternoon to play board games with your friends, this is the best place!"}
{"text":"Yep, bohemian? Is that the word to describe it? 
Was a bit taken back at the fact you have to take your shoes off at this place. 
Interesting atmosphere, people bringing their own instruments to play or maybe were they there from the place for people to use, Im not sure. Little cubby hole seatings, a seat for one or larger groups, places by the window that have no seating just a raised platform with rugs to sit on with low tables for your food. Note books for people to randomly leave their mark and for you to read or view the art left by others. The crowd I would describe was quite \"earthy\". Almost like walking into a different zone all together. 
However, once I got over that and had their healthy food. Oh it was pretty tasty. Looked and was pretty simple meals but surprisingly there was some goood flavor in it too! And to know you are eating healthy - well done Bampot! Had the hummus and salad. But the pitas almost tasted like they were home made (maybe they were I didnt ask) and the salad dressing?! I asked what was in it but really they should just bottle that up and sell it. 
The tea I chose was a miss sorry to say. I think it was a chai base and apple or something I forget (was a month ago). My friend's mango one apparently was very tasty!
Only thing, the tea did not seem too hot when it came out.
The waitress got some things off, as my friend had to wait exceptionally long for her poutine soup - which they got mixed up with another dish and only told us until we questioned the long wait (my other friends were hungry and already almost finished their meal before my other friend got hers) and by that time she just changed it to the carrot soup which was already available. 
You do have to be open minded about the eclectic earthy hippy atmosphere and who ever you bring should be like that too. 
Well I am not much of a bohemian, the service is questionable at times, but Im interested in teas and healthy food that tastes good!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The tea selection, the vibe, the games, the food, the help, the cozy spots in the front by the window, the activities they provide on certain days of the week...I really can hang here all day!"}
