{"text":"Awsome night on thursday, good dj in the mix of dubstep, one of the best upcoming cleveland clubs in my opinion."}
{"text":"This might hurt a bit.  If I could give a half a star, I would. And that would only be for the apology we received after an awful visit.   First, I'd like to preface this review with the fact that the only reason Myxx even got a chance from me was a Living Social coupon. After reading all of the reviews and passing this place on my jogging route, I knew it wasn't a hit, but I felt like it deserved a chance...  As soon as we sat down, we were greeted by a bartender whom we later learned was a \"fill in\" and had no idea what he was doing. (Sorry, but I'm about to be ruthless--this experience was REALLY disappointing.) When we didn't get cocktail menus, I was a little nervous, because normally martini bars have drink menus not just so people can see what they have, but also to show off what they can serve and what they're good at. We first heard the dreadful words \"Jolly Rancher\" when we asked for drink suggestions. This wasn't a certain Jolly Rancher, but all flavors mixed together for a fruit punch jolly rancher, which I've never heard of. My accomplice had the Jolly Rancher and, bless her heart, took a brave sip. And that was it. Luckily, I asked for details because fruit punch flavored anything always ends in regurgitation for me. So, in avoidance of a bad experience (heh...), I was recommended a raspberry martini. I'll refer to those drinks from now on as the \"Jolly Regurgitation\" and \"Rasp-butt Martini\" because those were absolutely UNdrinkable. What made it worse was that no one seemed to notice or care that we weren't touching our drinks at what is (as far as I can tell) aimed to be a cocktail and tapas bar.  When we finally received our food (in bits and pieces), it was thoroughly unimpressive. The beet salad was served with WAY too much arugula, a strong green that should be used in moderation, what we're pretty sure were 3 slices of canned beets, and some goat cheese water drizzled and hidden underneath the arugula. Boo. The stuffed pepper was actually pretty good, though at this point, nothing they could have done would have brought them back from this failure. Since we got our salads first, I expected our appetizers shortly afterward, but the pepper came mid-salad and when it did, we received a \"Sorry, I gave your fries to someone else; don't be mad.\" and didn't see fries for at least another 10-15 minutes. The fries were sparse. Small thin fries are good, but we left hungry--they were intended to be our starchy savior, but didn't deliver.   Luckily, we smelled the seafood on another passing plate before ordering some of the enticing seafood appetizers. Seafood should never smell like that...  As far as the space goes, we felt like we were in a school for a holiday party or something. It was strange. They really need to break it up somehow, but that's the least of the issues we encountered here. Also, like Brandon L. said, the bathroom doors being open was COMPLETELY disgusting and since we sat at the bar, we could see straight into the men's room.   Like I said, we got a nice apology when we were leaving, which was appreciated, but it seemed like it turned into groveling for customers really quickly. Needless to say, I'm not going to be back, no matter how great the coupon is. With great competition like The Fairmount right across the street, Myxx needs to try a completely different approach or up its game immensely."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to eating at Myxx for several weeks when I went last weekend. The space is huge and well decorated. We were a group of ten and the service was prompt and attentive. While there was nothing grossly wrong with the food, it just wasn't that special, especially for the price. I ordered the char-grilled chicken philly sandwich. It was cooked well and the flavor was fine, but I wouldn't order it again.   Because it is located so conveniently, I would try Myxx again but would order something different on the menu.   I hope that they put curtains on the massive windows, because our primary complaint was feeling like we were being watched while we ate. A set happy hour menu or something like \"Wednesday night $5 burgers\" would be a great addition to the menu."}
{"text":"If you've read my Wonder Bar review, you'll know that it's extremely rare for Kaitlin D. or me to not finish our drinks completely. Well, at Myxx, we couldn't stomach more than a sip or two of our drinks.  Also, their food is like the convenience store version of food from nice restaurants, and the space made me feel like I was in my elementary school cafeteria.  The End."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Myxx on a Wednesday evening around 5pm.  We found out they had a happy hour during this time (Monday-Friday 4-7pm which include $2 domestic beers & well drinks $3 specials on shots, and their appetizers are buy one and get the 2nd one 1/2 off).    We ordered the classic jumbo shrimp cocktail ($11), mussels provencal ($12), roasted pepper chorizo con queso dip ($7), and hand cut rosemary roasted garlic steak fries ($7).  Our food was also served with a basket of 4 small slices of bread (2 white, 2 cinnamon, raisin, and nut) with butter.  The shrimp cocktail was served on a small bed of shredded lettuce with too tiny slices of lemon and 3 pieces of shrimp.  We could not believe we only got THREE shrimp for 11 dollars, even if they were jumbo, and the cocktail sauce was nothing amazing.  The mussels were good, but again nothing amazing.  I did not want to drink the broth like I do at some other restaurants.  The dip was good and unique.  Finally, something worth ordering again.  The dip was served with soft pretzels.  My boyfriend liked the dip a lot.  The fries were good too and so were their dipping sauces (a homemade ketchup and a mayo-like sauce).  Both the dip and the fries were served as a good portion.  I enjoyed the fries the best.   When we were at Myxx there was only one other couple at the bar and no one at the tables.  The atmosphere seems pretentious as the bartender was not very friendly and the manager on duty (the only other staff member we saw besides 2 people that most likely work in the kitchen) did not approach us to see if we were enjoying ourselves.  You would think if you are one of the two parties in the restaurant he would want to make sure we were enjoying our time.  Although the manager did have time to change the music station several times.  The bartender also kept brushing her hair and putting on makeup in an area that looked like a server/ice station.  Although she was probably bored, this is not something I like to see by restaurant staff out of the bathroom.  Myxx is clean and newly renovated.  There is a big granite bar, stage, lots of interesting art work, and 5 flat screen tvs in the main area.  The decor is very modern.  Overall, Myxx might be good for a large party as the restaurant space is very large (used to be Jillian's), but the menu is overpriced with room for improvement."}
{"text":"I thought about it and the space could host functions such as weddings in good fashion."}
{"text":"To start off - The doors to the bathroom's are left opened which is fine.. what is not fine is that from sitting at the bar you can see staright into the Men's room and see the sinks.  This allowed us to see the Kitchen staff go into the bathroom, then walk out without washing their hands..  Need I say more??  And this happened a few times while the owners were there so clearly this place is dirty and does not enforce rules."}
{"text":"I would like to first start out with a few positives...   The space is absolutely unique and swanky! The staff was attentive. The drinks were delicious.   Now onto the full experience...  We were there on a Friday evening during what should have been a dinner rush, but we were one of only three seated tables, which would be fine if the space wasn't so vast. It was odd being in such a large space alone. It lacked intimacy.   We ordered cocktails and h'ordeuvres to start. The cocktails were all mixed very well, but our first round of food was less than ideal. The chorizo queso dip tasted store-bought and lacked any authentic flavors. The lamb shanks were prepared well, but lacked inspiration.   Our entrees were a mixed bag also, my partner's burger was phenomenal and prepared to the correct temperature and seasoned very well, but my filet was far beyond the point of \"rare\" and lacked in the taste category.   We opted out of dessert.    This place would be great for a quick cocktail with friends especially if you are seeking a different vibe than traditionally offered in Cleveland Heights."}
{"text":"Myxx - why do you look more like a roller rink than a restaurant?  We stopped in to the bar to grab a drink and check the space out.  Imagine this scene - a giant beautiful bar.  Three tables by the door. And a vast, open wood floor.  With no tables.  To the very right, behind some fancy white curtains - there are more tables for what appears to be a private party.  It was the craziest set-up I have seen for a \"restaurant\" in quite some time.  The bar staff were very friendly.  Our drinks were pretty expensive ($10 each) and very mediocre. There was only one other couple eating dinner at one of the weird tables by the door.  Eventually people started rolling in for the private party, but it didn't liven up the place at all since they were totally separated.  I guess Myxx has realized that they are not really cutting it in the normal restaurant business and are now devoting most of their space and energy to private functions.  Which honestly may be best, but at least make the \"store front\" part of your business look appealing!"}
