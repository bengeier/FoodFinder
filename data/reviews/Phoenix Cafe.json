{"text":"Tried the one uptown, and like others say, the menu is different. They don't have a Chinese menu so it takes some time to figure out what is what. Came here for lunch and it got busy at 11:45 so come early. Portions are huge. Price is also more expensive, but it is downtown core so it's understandable."}
{"text":"Limited choices compared to their uptown locations. Aside from that this is probably the best place in the area for HK style milk tea and foods."}
{"text":"Way worse than other Phoenix restaurants  Cash/debit only Cafeteria style no service (order up front, pick up own dish from counter, get own plastic utensils) Plastic utensils and bowls Limited menu At least 30% more expensive  Not coming back, felt like a rip off"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try out this place. I agree with the rest of the reviews that it's a bit different feeling from other uptown locations under the same brand name. It's a bit more modern, very comfortable ambience.   The price point caught me off guard a bit. I fully expect the downtown location would be pricier. In Markham, you are looking at $9-10 for a rice dish with cold drink, and it's $14-15 here. Let's just say at that price range, there are a lot of other choices at downtown for lunch.  The food is good. Not comparable to uptown locations, but is still quality. I ordered curry chicken, and the potatoes are obviously boiled and added in last minute, very bland.  Overall 3/5, -1 star for price point, -0.5 for food quality, and -0.5 for using all disposable plates/bowls/utensils, got to be environmentally aware!"}
{"text":"Small menu, but tasty.   -1 star for value and service  I've never been to the uptown locations, nor have I ever had Haianese chicken or cube toast before, so this was a novel experience for me.  This location is on the second level, above the BMV books.  When you enter, you place your order with two servers at the front desk.  They give you a pager and you pick your own seat.    The Haianese chicken was GREAT.  It comes with rice cooked in the oil from the chicken, and clear broth (presumably also from the chicken.)  The meat is tender, juicy, and sweet.  The flavour is subtle- it doesn't kick you in the face, but it does prompt you to savour every bite.  I was unable to finish my dish, and I'm happy to note that it warms up well.  The rice is even more flavourful the next day!   I was a little apprehensive about the cube toast.  I was not expecting it to be a literal cube, I was thinking more along the lines of HK french toast.  It comes with your choice of ice cream on top, strawberries, bananas, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce drizzled on top.  It is surprisingly awesome.  The exterior of the toast is thin but crunchy with a wheaty flavour.  The interior is like milk bread, soft with a bit of chew.    The service lacked responsiveness.  The people taking orders were obviously pretty bored.    The price point is a bit high for what you get- I also got a cold milk tea with my chicken (the cube toast was free, part of a grand opening special) and the total was $16!  I'd expect a chicken dish and tea to be more like $12 in this area."}
{"text":"I was really excited for the opening of a HK style cafe in this area and really wanted to like it but consistent with all of Phoenix's other locations, I was fairly disappointed. Is it just me or is the price point here more expensive than the uptown locations? It costs $5 for an egg and Luncheon meat sandwich. They did put a good about of meat though, even though it wasn't quite fried and was kind of mushy. Their baked rice/pastas cost about $12-14 before tax and based on other reviews, it looks like they skimp on the protein (e.g. Only one small chicken cutlet). Their hot HK milk tea costs $2.50 but is quite small too. Their menu is also quit  limited unlike the Phoenix caf√©s elsewhere in the GTA and full of DIY items (e.g. Pick your noodles and protein). Overall I think they're overcharging for what it is but if you are looking for a cha chan tang and HK milk tea in a pinch, this place will do for this area as I don't know of anywhere better nearby."}
{"text":"The hainanese chicken is my favourite! I used to go to the one in thornhill but this branch is equally good. It's cafeteria style so it's very affordable! I haven't tried the dessert but I think I'll come back for it!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try an HK style cafe in downtown Toronto. The fried chicken cutlet on fried rice was pretty good and the portions are huge. One baked chicken and rice dish lasted me two meals lol. One complaint though.. I  didn't like how they served everything in take out containers and only had plastic cutlery!? Reminds me of the cheaper take out hk style cafes at 2x the price. I'd rather go to uptown or mississauga. Buttttttttt if you're ever craving hk style yeen yeung or baked pork chop rice or whatever you fancy... you can get it here! Enjoy ~"}
{"text":"Interesting concept with the fast food style pay first, find your own seat kind of experience. The food was very mediocre. I ordered the thin steaks on top of fried rice with garlic sauce. The flavors were decent, but for 12 bucks I expected a little more than just meat and sauce on top of rice. There wasn't a single piece of vegetable to be found. Everything in the restaurant came in disposable containers which made it feel like I was eating a large airplane meal. At least the portions are generous, but that's about the only saving grace.   Disclaimer: I only tried their food, not the drinks or snacks so I can't comment on those."}
{"text":"Clean Hong Kong style cafe near Ryerson that serves typical HK cafe food + some fusion dishes. We ordered the Hainanese Chicken Rice and Malaysian Curry Beef with Rice. The Hainanese Chicken was very tender and the sauces were flavourful, better than what you'll find at most HK style cafes. The Malaysian Curry Beef was unique and had a coconut taste that wasn't too spicy. The beef itself wasn't as tender but it was good enough to mix with the curry for a flavourful dish. The rice for both dishes was slightly seasoned and tasted great. Overall a good experience, I would recommend the Hainanese Chicken with Rice, but the prices are definitely higher than other Hong Kong style cafes. If you're craving HK style comfort food and can't head uptown, this place is great."}
{"text":"Ordered a simple HK Milk tea and had a bad experience with the persian cashier girl with the high bun on her head. I wish mgmt hired cashiers that could at least count and know how to deal with change. My drink can up to $3.67 and I gave her $10.70 in cash ($10 bill, 2 quarters, 2 dimes) and she was so stumped by it and said \"wait, the drink is only 3 something, why did u give me so much cash?\". Cuz maybe I want get rid of my change and have less coins?? Duh! Bc she was all confused and baffled by the math, she lost one of the quarter I gave her and proceeded to accuse me that I short changed her. What a complete I'd*it! This place should hired at least experienced cashiers so they don't leave turn their customers off. Won't be returning to this place. Also, the drink was nothing special. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch to try it out. Had some trouble locating the place as it's on the second level and on the map it seemed like it was closer to panera but it's actually all the way to the end of the building and the entrance is located beside bmv. I had the Hainese chicken for lunch and it was a good portion and decent price at only 10.99. The chicken was tasty enough but definitely need the red dipping sauce they provide you. I had some trouble choosing drink options as I'm not familiar with hongkong style tea. I thought they had bubble tea but they have this concoction of black tea with coffee which was interesting but I probably wouldn't order it next time. Place was spacious tho and if you want a quick bite downtown this is a good option to the mall food court."}
{"text":"Self-service. Cash and debit only. I thought this would a sweet spot to have my HK food fix instead of going to Chinatown.   Shredded chicken fried rice: Average. Clumpy rice with cheap lettuce and little chicken mixed with soy sauce. The only pro is the fairly large portion/.   Malaysian beef with rice: Super spicy, generic sauce, Beef was tender. Potatos had no flavour.   Hainanese chicken with rice: Good, not great. Chicken could be more tender. Sauces were unconventional, missing the green onion ginger sauce. Rice is tasty but quite broken down, would have liked the rice structure to be more intact.   Wish that all the dishes came with a drink. Steep prices."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you are expecting a similar experience as the locations uptown or you will be disappointed.  The good: Portions are big No wait to get a table  Food comes out fast Clean   The bad: Food quality is significantly worse Food does not come as a set (no tea or soup) Prices are probably double the prices uptown Limited menu compared to other locations   There is one other hk style Chinese restaurant 5 mins away that is a better option. I don't like posting other restaurants for a review as I don't like advertising for competitors. But this place is pretty bad if you were expecting the same experience."}
{"text":"Been to other Phoenix cafes before, however not particularly a big fan of this one. Incomparable with the others.  They've cut down the menu by a lot, and the food was extremely bland. Had the baked pork chops with spaghetti and tomato sauce, literally taste like plain spaghetti with canned tomato soup. The pork chop wasn't great either, super hard and dry.  Would not come back"}
{"text":"The food here is very much on par with other Hong Kong cafes, but the the self-serviced dining detracts at least one star from this review."}
{"text":"We are no strangers to Phoenix.  We always get Hainan chicken with rice.  Always.  Hearing about this downtown location, I was excited to give it a try.    Grand opening special until June 16th, 2017.  Purchase a meal and get a fee drink or dessert.  Whaaaaaat?!?!  Amazing!!!    The style of this cafe is quick-serve.  Order at the counter, pay, get a buzzer, get a seat, and wait to be notified.  Pretty straightforward. They currently use bamboo plates which have less environmental impact than the regular disposable kind.  Nice.    We ordered the Hainan chicken with rice (obvi) and the Malaysian curry with rice.  Our free choices were brick toast with black sesame ice cream and pancake (which was actually two crepes) with green tea ice cream.  3 people shared this and couldn't even finish everything.  Sad, I know.   Unfortunately, our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs this evening.    I think everything would've been worth paying regular prices.  Now I don't have to eat this uptown anymore.  It's at a great downtown location!  Welcome to downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"The French toast with peanut butter filling is awesome  it's the same as always I have in Hongkong. Their milk tea is awesome too."}
{"text":"It pains me to have to write a bad review for such a beloved uptown chain, but between the food and the disorganized staff, there was little room for redemption at Phoenix this past weekend.   I was handed a flyer on yonge st so a group of friends and I decided to check it out for lunch. The first thing I noticed is that the menu at this location is significantly smaller than uptown locations, but also more expensive. We sampled a good portion of the menu with: -steak club sandwich -baked chicken steak -soup noodle with fish -Hainanese chicken  Our food came out pretty quickly but it was hard to hear them call out our numbers, so the waitstaff had to keep coming over to ask for our numbers. After taking our first bites, our table shared a moment of silence and then hesitantly concluded that despite the dishes looking pretty, the food was heavily under-seasoned and bland. Each of us ended up using 3-4 pepper / salt packets to flavour our food.  Other honourable mentions of the visit included: -extremely wobbly table. We had to fix it ourselves with 2 menus folded up.  -small washrooms. Legit feels like you have to sit on the toilet seat to get the door closed.  -security cameras everywhere! Why do they need to keep such a close eye on their patrons? -sticky hot sauce packets at the self-serve station -no credit card payment -no wifi! Very surprising for a cafe  Needless to say, our group left quite disappointed with Phoenix. I hope this store can improve upon their soft opening as I was super excited to see a Phoenix open downtown."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for yelp, I wouldn't have known about this place. It's on the second floor with just a small door next to BMV. Inside the space is nice and one could be comfortable staying for a while.  Got the baked pork chop in tomato sauce, with the HK milk tea. Both are classic and you can't really go wrong with them. The portion is huge! People say it's pricey but I've seen other places nearby charge more for less."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, pretty pricey, food quality isn't that good. The restaurant is quite empty when we arrive around 1pm. Wouldn't recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I was craving HK cafe food for a while after relocating downtown. I don't own a car so I rarely make the trek to Markham.   Prices are a bit higher compared to other locations and meals don't come with soup and drinks. For this prime real estate a few minutes from Dundas Square, it makes sense.   I did not notice a difference in quality from food here to what you can find in Markham. On this visit we ordered the hainanese chicken and baked chicken steak with black pepper sauce.   Hainanese chicken: chicken was really well cooked, had the a nice soft texture and rice was very flavourful. I really enjoyed the 2 sauces that came along with the dish.   Chicken steak: huge portions and very well cooked. Black pepper sauce was a bit on the peppery side and lacked some acidity.   I will definitely be making return visits to try out the other dishes with friends and coworkers.   Drink menu is also similarly prices with Markham locations. Yin yang( coffee and tea with milk ) was only 2.50 so I will be visiting here for take out drinks occasionally as well:)"}
{"text":"Walked up a flight of stairs to the second floor, brightly lit with beams of lights along the walls. You're not going to get much help in terms of accessibility.  First thing you see when you enter the cafe is the washrooms on the left and a line of people ordering at the front. Guess it's the kind of place where you line-up at the front, grab a number, and then wait till they call your number out. Reminds me of those chinese food courts.  Clean washrooms.  There are no servers here, but presumably they haven't been hired because just outside the store there's a big sign that says they're hiring people to fill in \"dining room server\" positions. So once you figure out what you want to order, go up to the front and put in your order.  When your order is placed, you will be given a device notifying you that your order is ready. It's quite a piece of technology: it buzzes and lights up in various colours when they call you. Definitely a step up from a piece of paper and someone yelling out your number in vain.  They do not have extra utensils available that you can pick up on your own. If you require extra utensils, you will have to request it from the counter.  I ordered the Hainanese chicken (with rice) along with a cube toast.  For $10.50, the chicken dish comes with a bowl of chicken oil rice, about half a dozen pieces of chicken, two pieces of cucumber, some sauces for the chicken, and a bowl of soup on the side. The soup itself had that familiar MSG flavour. Couldn't take more than one sip. The chicken tasted like what I expect hainanese chicken to taste, but it wasn't particularly memorable. The rice was ok.  The cube toast was pretty good. Bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside with butter. Comes with ice cream of your choice and slices of strawberry and banana. Couldn't really finish the bread itself though because it was too hard, but maybe that's how it works.  Overall, I'd give the food a 3-star, under the assumption that you do not have time to walk over to chinatown to get the same meal for half the price.  My issue with the restaurant is the service. I came during the grand opening promotion, so the toast was free as it qualified as a dessert. Someone ahead of me ordered a drink, but the person taking the order did not mention that there was a promotion and the drink was free.  For some others in the group, they decided to serve the dessert first before serving the meal item. They were also inconsistent in asking whether the dessert should be served with the meal, or after.  Also, the place closes at 9:45 PM (based on their menu where items are available from 11 AM to 9:45 PM), but they started asking people to leave at 9:20."}
{"text":"This place wastes resources! No recycling, no compost bin - even though they use biodegradable dishes. They don't degrade in landfill! Oh, also the food is terrible."}
{"text":"Love this place. The Hainanese chicken is spot on, the chicken is poached to perfection, sauce is sumptuous and it comes with chicken soup from the chicken. Huge portions, I forced myself to finish it because it was just so darn good, but it could easily be 1.5 - 2 meals.   We came as a big group and took over the plenty of seating, it's surprisingly quiet and almost a sanctuary within such close proximity to Yonge-Dundas square. A taste of comfort after a day of shopping or movie watching.   BONUS: My friend pierced through the plastic cup as he poked a hole in his milk tea, and we made a huge mess, the workers quickly cleaned it up plus offered to make him a brand new milk tea. A+ for service."}
{"text":"Downtown Toronto sorely lacks HK Style cafes, and Phoneix Cafe is like the Burger King of HK Style cafe.  And finally a little bit of Markham is now in the 6.  This may not be the best, but I'm glad to have an option to get my baked rice dish or hainese chicken.  I wouldn't be sending anyone who just arrived from HK there immediately, but if they're going to school nearby and maybe have been here for months looking for a bit of taste of home, this'll do.  This'll do laddy.. this'll do."}
{"text":"I ordered the hainanese chicken and it was delicious!!! My husband ordered a curry chicken.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great cheap eats in Yonge and Dundas area. You order at the counter and they buzz you when the food is ready. Though it's fast food in that sense, the seating is fairly modern and comfy, with a decent number of tables and some booths.  I got the hainanese chicken with rice and was not disappointed - the portions are pretty generous too. If you get a dessert I definitely recommend sharing with a friend.    As others mentioned the garbage situation is unfortunate, there isn't compost or recycling so everything just goes in the garbage. Incredibly wasteful hope they fix it soon!"}
{"text":"WOULD give zero stars if I could... came here three times and all three times the store was closed and not operating LITERALLY confused and annoyed I'm never going to come here again what a stupid waste of time."}
{"text":"HK style cafe meets a modern twist, fitting for the likes of Downtown Toronto. If you're looking for familiar HK cafe food, this is the place. Of all the Chinese restaurants in the core of Toronto, this is one of the few that solely serves this Chinese soul food.  4/5 - Food 3.5/5 - Overall Experience  Although the food at this place is just as you would remember at any other HK cafe, the one thing that sets this apart, in a not-so-good way is the menu structure. Your typical HK cafe usually serves a variety of meal combos that come with the signature HK milk tea. Phoenix however does not. Everything is ordered individually, and not at familiar HK cafe prices. If you were to get a meal and a drink, you're look at around $15. This can be pricey for lunch.  Apart from the menu, the service is similar to a self-serve counter. You can order at the front, and they will bring the food to your table, or can can pick it up. They offer a wide range of classics, such as pork chop with tomato sauce on rice, or Hainanese chicken.  If you're looking for good HK comfort food in downtown Toronto, this is the place. Just don't expect the same feeling or price point as an HK cafe uptown."}
{"text":"Phoenix Cafe serves Hong Kong style cafe food. The cafe is simple, modern and clean. It is not a fancy restaurant. There is no table service, but the prices are reasonable and the food is delicious.   I had the Hainanese Chicken with Chicken Oil Rice ($10.50). The dish was not bad, but the rice could have been more flavourful if they prepared the rice in chicken broth.  The signature Hong Kong style milk tea was delicious ($3.50) and pairs well with the Hainanese Chicken.  For dessert, the thick ice cream toast ($8.50) is probably the best thick ice cream toast I had in toronto. Banana, strawberry and black sesame ice cream served on thick golden toast."}
{"text":"Came here for their $2 pineapple bun promo. We tried the green tea icecream and sliced butter bun. It was my first time trying butter with pineapple bun and tbh the idea of eating a slab of butter was really off putting but it was actually quite interesting - in a good way. The slightly salty butter was a nice contrast to the sweet pineapple bun. However, after a couple of bites it got a little too much - definitely would not be able to eat more than half of it. The green tea icecream one was good but the icecream was overpowering so essentially it just tasted like any other mediocre green tea icecream with bread.   Overall, the dessert was okay however the buns itself were cold and didn't taste fresh. I'm glad I got to try it during the promo but I would not get the buns at regular price ($6)"}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting it to be the same as the Phoenix Restaurants uptown. This place does not come close when being compared to the uptown locations.  Unlike the uptown Phoenix Restaurants, Phoenix Cafe downtown is food court style where you order at the front and wait for your food before bringing it to your table, and when you're done, you dispose of your own garbage. There is no service. Also, everything is served in disposable containers, making it seem quite cheap.  Also, the serving sizes are considerably small and expensive for what you're getting. The food is mediocre at best. The value just isn't there.  There are definitely Chinese restaurants downtown with better food, better service, and better value."}
{"text":"Disappointed in this garbage creating throw away style restaurant. Like all the other reviews it fails to taste like the uptown Phoenixes, the taste is closer to the taste of cafeteria food. I can understand the price point as the rent must be 6 times more than the landmarks uptown but they are missing the quality which is a fail.   They can claim the bowls are biodegradable but like all compostable items if It's not going to a composite it is not being composted. A biodegradable item cannot biodegrade in a bag or in a landfill. It's a faulty claim as all they have is a garbage can. I used my chopstick to break a hole in my drink so I can save a straw and gave them back a spoon to try save on the resources. Even the Eaton's Centre food court has a system to try to save on creating garbage. Let's move forward....."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my wife...qas heading towards salad king but my wife wanted to try this.  I had the curry beef... thus did not taste hone made, more store bought bottle and the beef look very unappetizing.  My wife had the pork chop rice. ..first I don't know why my wife likes pork chops, sitting on rice with tomato sauce and then baked...must be a Hong Kong thing...t just seems gross. I think after eat this here she will change her mind ordering this in the future.  Good view.  Clean...  Won't be coming back...  Side note: this place or franchise is supposed to be famous for their chicken rice so maybe try that and skip the curry and pork chops."}
{"text":"There aren't many (if any) HK cafes in Toronto outside of Chinatown. As a fan of the Phoenix Cafes uptown, I was excited to discover that they have opened a location downtown, and in such an accessible area.   The layout of this cafe is cafeteria style: you place and purchase your order at the front and receive a buzzer that alerts you when your order is ready to be picked up. Orders are served in disposable dinnerware.    Although still lengthy, the menu here is much smaller than their other locations but carry the popular dishes, my favourite being the Malaysian curry with roti and Hainanese Chicken. Portions seems smaller here than uptown (or maybe I was just confused by the curry served in a paper-like bowl) and there doesnt appear to be the typical meal combos found at HK cafes.   Not a bad option given its convenient location but definitely not your typical HK cafe experience."}
{"text":"Price: 3/5  The baked chicken fried rice with tomato sauce cost $12 + tax.  Cash / debit only!  I'm fine especially how most other Asian restaurants would charge an additional fee for debit card transactions.  Given the location and atmosphere of the location, it's priced higher with less variety than York Regions HK-Western style restaurants.  Usually, a meal comes with a beverage as a \"combo\".  Service and Atmosphere: 3/5  It's cafeteria style so order at the desk and you'll get a beeper where you'll retrieve your food when it buzzes.  Staff spoke decent English and partially friendlier than other Asian restaurants in the proximity.  Food: 2/5  I ordered the baked chicken fried rice with tomato sauce.  It was made to order so took a while to make during lunch time.  I didn't mind since it'll be take out.  I was looking forward to this as the HK-\"Western\" style restaurants aren't too common in downtown Toronto.  Sadly, it was very disappointing.  There was a LOT OF MSG in the fried rice, within an hour of consuming it, my mouth got that bitter taste of msg-flavoring.  The tomato sauce was very bland and tasted like a thicker bland version of \"Ketchup\".  Chicken was cooked well and there were no bones in my dish.  I'll be going home to make a diy gok-fai-cha to rid of the toxins from my mouth.  I would avoid the fried rice.  I will probably re-visit the HK-thick toast and sesame ice cream.  There shouldn't be any msg in that, right?  I'm always craving sesame / green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"It's like a cafeteria style HK restaurant.  It has baked rice or noodles, sandwiches, noodle soup and desserts.   You order your food and have a seat.  You get a buzzer and when your order is ready it vibrates and you pick up your food."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite place to grab lunch in the Yonge and Dundas area. They make very traditional Hong Kong style food, especially their all-day breakfast menu. Their signature Hainanese chicken is also very good and filling. The exterior of the building doesn't do this place justice because the interior looks amazing. The atmosphere is also very nice inside although the washroom stalls are pretty small. The only downside is that the menu is pretty pricey. But if you are okay with spending $15~20 for lunch then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"A Malaysian friend told me about this place and how they had Hainanese chicken and roti so I decided to come check it out.   This place is amazing. The hainanese chicken is soft, juicy, boneless, and the oil rice smelled and tasted so good. It also comes with a bowl of soup. I got a platter of roti (2 pieces) and they were oh so good too. I will definitely get some curry next time. I wish they had more Malaysian food (like char kwey teow and satay) but they did have satay beef in Magee mee which I'll try next time.   The desserts looked great too and they have all day breakfast as well.    Everything was really cheap too! I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Good: convenient location, nice clean interior, great views with large windows  Meh: a little pricey for food that is average   Could improve: no wifi  Review based on: been here on multiple occasions (due to convenience) and have had the pork steak on rice, hainan chicken, lemon tea, HK milk tea, pannacotta dessert thing."}
{"text":"Portions are huge, but dont really expect great quality or taste.   This is an order at the restaurant, then sit down. Kitchen was pretty fast.    Service: 4/5 Food: 2/5 (was...cooked enough, i think?) Price: 3/5 (itll fill you up, big portions)"}
{"text":"Meh - that is how I really feel after coming to the downtown location. It's in a place that caters to university students and doesn't capture the Chinese diner feel I get when I visit Phoenix near my parents in Markham.  The interior is actually quite nice - it's on the second floor, but the exterior signage is very noticeable so kudos to them on that. The banquette seats are comfortable, and there is a TV to keep you up to date with what's happening on CP24.   You order from the counter and they give you a Buzz pad for pick up when your food is ready. Given that we ordered 5 items, it was quite a pain that we had to go up 5 times because nothing came out together. I would've much rather waited a little longer for one full run as I wasn't sure if I should start eating before my buzzer went off again.  I am not sure of the prices compared to uptown, but it felt more expensive - maybe because everything was served on bamboo / eco-friendly disposable plates. The portions felt small and everything was just subpar. While there was a drink special and a dessert promo happening for their grand opening, nothing was worth more than what we were paying for - red bean ice, was exactly that - full of ice; the crepe was tiny and overloads of whip cream to take over the plate.  The only plus was that the Hainese chicken was consistent with their uptown locations, so at least you can feel confident that the dish they are well known for did not disappoint.  Otherwise, this place is mediocre at best..."}
{"text":"Finally a Hong Kong style restaurant with milk tea from a brand well known from up north. Milk tea tastes fine. Had the instant noodles with luncheon meat and egg and it tasted okay. Come support this new restaurant steps from Yonge Dundas square."}
{"text":"The food I ordered from here was somewhat bland honestly. I ordered the chicken w/ buttered toast and eggs and the chicken was lacking. The drink I got was good though. I recommend the NaiCha Milk Tea if you're a fan of Hong Kong style milk tea.   As a plus, I went here with a few friends and the wait time for our food was quick. They also have a lot of menu options. Might return to try out the desserts and drinks, but if I'm really hungry for an actual meal I would probably visit another restaurant."}
{"text":"It's a Hong Kong style food place. Went to this place twice. First time I ordered their Malaysian Chicken Curry and their Nepolian black sesame ice cream dessert.  The were both good. The curry had a good texture and taste and Nepolian Ice Cream melts in your mouth. The second time I went, I ordered their vermicelli noodle soup with chicken steak. It was simple but delicious."}
{"text":"Please note my review is based on the grand opening promo where they offered a free dessert with any entree purchase.   Wasn't sure what to get so they recommended for me to order the baked porkchop dish.  So I got that with tomato sauce and fried rice.  Everything tasted good and portion size was decent.  Price was a bit high for what you get.  Would give this dish a 3.5 stars. For dessert I got the Napoleon ice cream dish.  Everything about it was good.   Wasn't too sweet, decent size, pastries were flaky.  Wouldn't mind getting this again at their normal price.  I would give this dish 4 stars."}
{"text":"This cafe had opened near my school and I was excited to try it since it was so near! Nevertheless, was not disappointed! The place was self-serve - wish I had known this before my friends and I waltzed in awkwardly, waiting to be seated. Once the workers, had told us this, we promptly sat down and gazed through the menu. The place is spacious with plenty of booths and tables, and not busy during our visit (3pm).   The food is really cheap! I had gotten the fried chicken (dark meat), which came with two fried eggs and a slice of buttered toast. It was $8.00! Hypothetically, it IS really cheap, but considering the meal, it was a fair trade - you're really just paying for the protein. It tastes really good, like top notch food you would be able to get prepackaged at an asian supermarket, only more fresh and homely. Also got iced coffee and iced milk tea, both hong kong style though I had enjoyed the milk tea more. Also got a toast ice cream as dessert and throughly enjoyed it - toast was warm and buttery and HUGE! Worth the $10!  Service is good as it can be when it comes to self-serve. Cashier was really friendly and chill. Only urk I had was when I was standing in front of two workers, waiting to ask for a fork and knife, while they chatted. They hadn't noticed me, and only did when a worker coming up behind them greeted me.   TLDR: worth the visit! would revisit for study breaks:)"}
{"text":"Very convenient location Order hainanese chicken rice,  environment is very nice and comfortable, good variety of drinks and  dessert, next time am going to order toast"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Phoenix Cafe frequently and have tried their pineapple buns, Malaysian curry with spaghetti, Hainan chicken with rice and milk tea.   I've tried their $2 pineapple buns special and its definitely worth that price.  I've tried the luncheon meat and egg, ham and egg, satay beef, bolognese and cheese and sesame seed ice cream.    The bolognese and cheese is saucy and messy (if you like that!).  I like the runny yolk in the ham and egg.  I did not know the sesame seed icecream came with whip cream!  I would say my favorite is the luncheon meat and egg (would like the luncheon meat much more if it was more well done/crispy).    The Hainan chicken dish is TO DIE FOR. It is honestly sooo good....the sauce...the flavorful rice....the chicken...sooo delicious!  I would come back just to get this dish!  BEST DISH ON THE MENU. Oh and a bonus, this dish comes with soup!  The Malaysian curry with spaghetti was also really good.  I like how they separate the spaghetti with the curry.  I got the curry chicken and it came with potatoes.  There's a nice kick to the curry.  Would also get this dish if I'm feeling saucy or curryful.   The HK tea tasted good. The tea taste a bit stronger compared to other places if you prefer that!"}
{"text":"i love this place! best HK cafe in the area for sure ... now i won't have to go uptown. the vibe is great too!"}
{"text":"Because of Grand Opening, dessert or a drink was for free if you order any meal. I ordered a bowl of vermicelli with ham and egg, then I got a cube toast with mango ice cream for free. Actually based on the price, nothing can be complained."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good. But this place is a lot different than other Phoenix restaurants. You must order in the front first. Then you go up to the front and grab your food. The price isn't cheap,so don't expect to get filled for bring less than $10. Overall it's a good place. But the reason why I gave it 3 stars because of the price. It's more expensive than other Phoenix restaurants."}
{"text":"Hong Kong style cafe.  Great place for traditional Hainan chicken and amazing cube toast dessert!"}
{"text":"It's really nice to have such a spacious and laid back spot in downtown. If you want a spot to chill with friends and for some dessert, this could be a good option, however, if you're looking for a quality meal, I would suggest going somewhere else.   Everything is self serve; you place your order over the counter and they give you a buzzer that flashes and vibrates when your food is ready.  The Hainese chicken is the one dish that I might order again just for the rice that comes in that set, that rice is my idea of really good comfort food. The chicken is cooked well, it surprised me that there were no bones, but it was a too greasy. The noodles and Malaysian beef curry was missing something in the flavor that I can't quite place. For the same price, you can get much better food elsewhere, and just as filling."}
{"text":"If you are used to the uptown locations turn back now. What makes Phoenix uptown good are not here, menu here is 1/10 the size, the memorable dishes not found here, a lot higher price point, drinks are extra, taste is just passable. If this wasn't named Phoenix, I would not have come in. Felt disappointed and cheated, will not return unless this is a real and full Phoenix. TLDR: name is dame but no substance, sad."}
{"text":"This is my type of cafe. No servers! You order your food at the counter, get a buzzer when your food is ready. The food is a typical Chinese fast food/comfort food. They sell things from Haiwanese Chicken, Baked chicken, fried rice, Malaysian style curry and even thick toast. Their food is simple and prices are good. You won't spend tons of money here! A great cheap eats cafe! :)"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good about 10-13 bucks a plate, good portions and quick service! Had the Hainese chicken and Malaysian beef curry with rice, super tasty. I'd go again!"}
{"text":"Had heir pork baked w udon in black pepper sauce. So good. Two giant pieces of pork. The 2$ difference was that my pork wasn't fried which is how I prefer it. Wild have liked some Veges though. Even if just some frozen peas or corn. Also more sauce to cover the udon. All in all a bit more pricey than Chinatown. Might come for the hainan chicken. The lai chai is well priced though and delicious. But next time I want HK style food I'll go to the HK diner upstairs on dundas."}
{"text":"I love Asian food, so when I found out about this \"Hong Kong style\" cafe, I had to check it out with my best friends.   When you come in, you can go choose where you'd like to sit and then when you're ready to order, go to the cashier and pay for your food right away. Cash and debit is only accepted so be prepared! They give a buzzer to let you know when your order is ready to be picked up.   We decided to each order a different dish and share them between the 3 of us--definitely shareable if you don't like to eat too much of the same food for a while (unless you're hangry, I take that back)  All of the dishes were from the Stir Fried/Fried section: Fried Spaghetti with Beef and Peppers, Seafood Fried Rice with Caviar, and Shrimp Pad Thai. Something different, something unique and a go to.   My favourite was the seafood fried rice with caviar. It was crispy, and it had a sweetness to it which made it addicting (or is there MSG? Just kidding). The shrimp pad thai met my expectations, and the fried spaghetti was a bit too oily for my liking.   My friends ordered panna cottas that were bigger than expected (the size of a specialty beverage) in ovaltine and black sesame, which they ended up not liking and the chocolate sauce was overwhelming.   I ordered the Napoleon with black sesame ice cream. It was maybe half the size of my face and surprisingly I finished it all. It wasn't the classic Napoleon that I had expected, but more of a flaky ice cream sandwich version of a \"strawberry shortcake\" with A LOT of ice cream. Who wouldn't want that?   I also ordered the cold Nai Cha which is a HK style milk tea. It wasn't too sweet but it had a good bitterness to it (I usually have a sweet tooth for sweet milk tea). My friend ordered a coke float with chocolate  ice cream and it was actually good.   We sat in a comfortable booth by the window, and the washrooms are individual and more private which is what I prefer. The staff was nothing but friendly, and I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu especially the bubble waffles because there is sweet and also savoury!"}
{"text":"The food here was slightly unimpressive to me. We ordered at the counter and they gave us a tray with our food. The cafe was very nicely decorated and gave off a warm and relaxed atmosphere.  I ordered the Hainanese Chicken which came with a side of soup and rice. The soup tasted like chicken broth with salt. They also gave us some sort of oil-based sauce and a fish-sauce based sauce. The chicken was slightly marinated so I dipped it into the fish sauce. I do commend their seasoned rice. I really enjoyed eating that. Overall, I wasn't a fan of the dish. It was simply rice and chicken to me."}
{"text":"I've been to Phoenix at other locations multiple times so I already had some expectations with this one and I gotta say everything is pretty good so far. I've had the hainanese chicken with rice, baked chicken steak on fried rice with cream corn sauce, pork chop cutlet with vermicelli noodle soup, chicken wings with potato salad snack and a green tea bubble waffle. They were really delicious with good portions. I love their cold nai cha but the red bean crush ice and sesame milkshake need some work. Overall, the staffs are nice and the place is clean. It's similar to a fast food joint where you order at the front and sit wherever there's space but so far it hasn't been busy."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Phoenix Cafe, it has a really nice modern atmosphere and the prices are not bad for the portions.    I tried the chicken cutlet with cream sauce on spaghetti. It was a large piece of chicken but it is dark meat, actually probably would have preferred a white meat version. However it was quite juicy and the cream sauce was not bad. Spaghetti was ok but might need more salt.   Also had the HK milk tea and I enjoyed it.  Overall a nice addition to the area, I will be back to try the curries."}
{"text":"Came here because someone was handing out menus of this restaurant so I decided to come here with a few of my ccoworkers, they were having a deal for buy one get one drink and half off for dessert. It's located upstairs on Edward Street, so on top of BMV books. The stairs itself is very nice, bright lighting. Right when you get step into the restaurant, that is where the cash register is and that is where you make your order. After ordering, they give you a tracker and you are free to choose whichever seat you like. When the food is read,y the machine will start vibrating and will light up, indicating that the food is ready.   I ordered a fruit punch crushed ice and my friend got the mint fruit punch crushed ice. The drink itself was not that special as I felt like it was not worth it for its original price. My other co-worker got the Napoleon ice cream dessert and she liked it. I would only come here if I was really up for trying other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Loved the uptown locations and glad the downtown location opened up. My friend and I both ordered the Hainanese chicken with cold lemon tea and the Hong Kong styled milk tea. Food was mediocre, in comparison to the uptown location. I was a little disappointed but maybe I'd try another item next time."}
{"text":"I definitely prefer the Hainanese chicken here over some of the restaurants in China Town ;) Generous portions. HK milk tea (hot) was flavourful and creamy as well."}
{"text":"Phoenix caf√© is a spacious spot on the second floor above the bookstore at the corner of Yonge and Edward. The interior is clean and modern with large tables making this a good lunch spot for groups. There's a large menu (almost too large!) with lots of options for breakfast and lunch with items and meals that you'd typically see at a Hong Kong caf√© or bakery. I came for lunch and ordered the club sandwich with a lai cha (Hong Kong style milk tea) which was tasty although the price was on the steeper end when you compare it to some of their other lunch items. The sandwich was stacked with pork chop, egg, lettuce and tomato and sandwiched between 3 nicely toasted pieces of bread, typical of what you'd expect from a club sandwich. In addition to the large amount of seating, Phoenix also has free WiFi which is a nice touch. I'll likely be back to try some of the other lunch items and the dessert items which also looked interesting!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Hainan Chicken Rice and it was absolutely delicious! The rice was warm and had the herbed flavour, and the sauces that accompanied the chicken were very yummy too. The spices definitely complemented one another. Although the meal is a bit on the pricey side for an HK style cafe, the portion sizes are relatively large. I was full after eating half.  What's really cool about this cafe in particular are the utensils used to serve the food. The food comes on large flakey wooden plates, and if you order to-go, they package it in a neat box (like a rice box). It's super unique and really fits in well with the hominess of the dish.  There's a few cool specials that come with adding on to your meal. Ie. 50% of dessert with purchase of meal, or BOGO drinnk with purchase of meal. Those can definitely be worth it when eating out with friends.  The place is also very quiet, clean, and spacious. Definitely a hard environment to find in the heart of downtown Toronto.  The employees were also very nice. I was incredibly parched after a long Toronto adventure and they just kept pouring me cups of water (albeit their cups were super small). Eventually they poured me two cups at a time :')  Phoenix Cafe never fails to disappoint, regardless of the location :)"}
{"text":"For a Sunday afternoon there were not thatamy people. Cannot really comment on the service since it is pretty much fast food style and self-serve. The food was pretty good but not the best Hainan chicken rice I have had. The environment was pleasant and comfortable. It is a very good place to meet up with friends. Overall there was nothing bad about the cafe. I will give it an 8/10."}
{"text":"Come hungry because all their dish portions are humongous :) I've been here a few times now and my favourites to get is their Malaysian curry with roti & their desserts!  //THE FOOD// Malaysian Curry (5/5)- Since I'm Malaysian, I had high standards, but man was I impressed. There were lots of tender beef slivers and potatos drenched with their seafood broth and coconut milk curry that's a medium-high spiciness. Definitely get the $5 roti add-on, super worth it since the dough was very fluffy and flavourful. I had absolutely no shame eating this dish with my hands :P  Cold Horlick Specialty Drink (5/5)- I was so excited to find this rarity on the drinks menu! Tasted very malty and had some wheatgerm chunks that I love. Ice cream Cube Toast (4/5) - I got it with green tea ice cream and it was SO GREAT. The scoop of icecream was humongous, and there was lots of banana & strawberry slices, and the entire toast was lined with whipped cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce. The bread was crisp on the outside and the inside was dense but still fluffy. I could taste the butter that was glazed over the bread which helped golden it up too! Panna Cotta (4/5) - ~$5 for a huge cup of panna cotta was surprising! I got the Ovaltine flavour and it was topped with chocolate sauce, lots of whipped cream, 2 lady finger pastries, and fresh strawberries. The panna cotta itself was a firm moussey texture packed with the Ovaltine flavour.  Sesame Panna Cotta (3/5)- strong sesame flavour but WAYYY too much chocolate sauce. Overwhelmingly sweet and drenched.  //THE ATMOSPHERE// You order your food and pay at the counter then you get a restaurant pager that vibrates & lights-up when your food is ready for you to get at the side of the counter. The place itself has plenty of sitting areas with windows lining the entire place. It's super modern and has a fireplace!  **Side-note: During one of the times I came, my friend & I's orders got misplaced so we waited for ~45minutes whereas they're normally really fast (~10min). So when they realized their mistake, they were nice enough to get our orders going and gave us a free drink on the house! Thumbs up for their great service.   I would definitely come back, it's an awesome place to get food to share with several people, while hanging out in a very neat space."}
{"text":"This is probably the closest thing you can find in downtown area (and not have to go to Chinatown) for Hong Kong style cafe.  The Hong Kong milk tea is absolutely legit and it is buy one get one until end of August (2017). The rice dishes are slightly over priced for what it is BUT it is right next to Dundas square so what can you do?! To be perfectly honest, it is still much better than anything else you can find around the block based on taste, presentation, portions in relations to price point. However snacks are quite reasonable!"}
{"text":"I did not realize there are multiple locations but this is the first downtown location for the Phoenix cafe. It is a Hong Kong style cafe and also serve pad Thai and Malaysian curry. It is on the second floor of  top of the BMV on Edward st, just off Yonge north of Dundas. It is very convenient. I have been there a few times now that I have tried several dishes.   Haienese chicken rice has nice tender chicken thigh meat and nice sauces. The chicken rice is a little less flavorful than I expected but still good.  Beef Malaysian curry has nice coconut flavor and is just spicy enough for me (but probably not spicy enough for my Malaysian friends).   The satay beef instant noodles is delicious! Just like Hong Kong.  The best is the fried chicken wings. It is exactly what I remember from Hong Kong. No batter chicken wings lightly seasoned. Crispy skins and nice juicy flesh. My favorite.   The cafe has nice and spacious seating. It's self serve. You order, pay, get a buzzer and get your food from the front when your buzzer goes off."}
{"text":"Hainanese chicken - Comes with rice cooked in the oil from the chicken (definitely better than plain rice!), chicken broth and a chili dipping sauce. It was more flavorful than other Hainanese chicken that I've had and I would recommend it!  I also got the bubble waffle w/black sesame ice cream for dessert since they were doing 50% off desserts w/purchase of an entree. The waffle was a bit too crispy but it was still pretty good. I felt the ice cream could have a lot more intense of a black sesame flavor (Kekou's black sesame ice cream is great!).  I really like the biodegradable palm plates that the food comes on since they supposedly decompose within 6-8 weeks."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! This place is tucked in the corner near Yonge/Dundas square and serves a wide variety of meals, desserts, and drinks. It's located up a set of modern lit stairs beside a book store. You'll see upon entering that there is a lot of seating space and a decent view of the outside.   I've been here a few times (usually before watching a movie at the theatre down the street) and tried something new every time. I've never had a problem with any of the food or drinks. As of today, I've tried the Hainanese chicken, the Malaysian curry, and various desserts and drinks. The curry meals are probably my favourite - they have a nice rich taste and a little kick from the spice that is quite bearable and not too spicy. Most of the meals come with a good portion of rice, some sliced veggies, and/or a serving of soup. I've always been quite full after finishing a meal here.   For drinks, I really like the classic Nai Cha (HK style milk tea). I found the 50% sweetness still to be a little sweet for my liking, but I overall really like the drink - probably my favourite here. Definitely give this place a try - it will be sure to satisfy a sweet tooth."}
