{"text":"I have been to Gin Mill many times over the years. Just a small dive bar. They usually have live music and the upstairs roof is an excellent spot to hang out.  There are drink specials every night. They have a ton of dart boards....Gin Mill is actually our go to place for darts as there are plenty of boards and rarely ever filled. They also have a table top shuffle board (I believe it costs $1).  Casual atmosphere with a large variety of people and ages as patrons.  Pro Tip- Free popcorn"}
{"text":"THE best Royal Flush in Charlotte: Steve Domenech makes them! AWESOME \"just make up some kinda shooter for us Panther fans...after a loss\": Holly or Chris!   This is a traditional, and very comfortable, neighborhood bar with great bartenders, darts, shuffleboard, table soccer, video golf, and free popcorn!    In warmer months, the rooftop bar is packed and rocking. Band schedules change by the week, but the live music on weekends is always good."}
{"text":"gotta agree w/Josh, got dragged there twice last yr as part of a group and the place is the bottom of the barrel as far as bars go....funny thing is when it first opened (probably 12 yrs ago) in its original incarnation it was a cool unique place to go and we went there often....now it seems like the help there are people who can't get a bar job anywhere else, most of the patrons are a little skeevy, or else guys who're looking for trouble, and the atmosphere is oppressive & dingy..WAY TOO many places to go in CLT to put up w/a bar like this"}
{"text":"Gin Mill is a solid place to grab a drink with friends in Southend. No food is served here, but they do have popcorn. For food, head next door to Tavern on Tracks. They do have a 2nd floor deck that used to have a great view of Uptown, but that is now obstructed. You'll find average service, the occasional karaoke and a plentiful amount of TV's and games like darts and Golden Tee."}
{"text":"Looking for a no prejudices bar where you can come as you are? Then the Gin Mill will be your happy place! I wouldn't go as far as calling it a dive bar, but if you're looking for frills and whistles, you may be disappointed. Cheap beer, fun bar games, and a beautiful rooftop terrace overlooking Southend. You won't find food here but there is free popcorn at your disposal. For most, I wouldn't call the Gin Mill a destination bar; more-so a great meeting point for you and your buddies, a place to pre-game before a concert or event, or place to stop by and have a few beers along your journey.   One thing to be very mindful of is parking... It's almost non-existent. If there is a concert at Amos' or a big event at the neighboring Tavern on the Tracks, famous for housing Buffalo fans of all sports, you'll struggle to find parking. Don't just pull in anywhere that you can; towing for neighboring has been prevalent."}
{"text":"This is the bar next to Amos' Southend.  It's actually nicer inside than you would expect and of course the perfect spot to grab a drink before a show.  It's a refreshingly sleazy, antsy crowd that hangs out and is always up to no good in the best possible way.  If I wasn't such an old fart I'd hang out here more often."}
{"text":"Echoing Becky's experience, I too have found myself sharing popcorn with total strangers after having a few adult beverages, but c'est la vie - it's all good!   The Gin Mill is a fun bar with lots of friendly staff.  I've seen some pretty good local musicians play here and definitely have played my share of shuffleboard and foosball.   They used to do trivia here during the week - can't remember which night though.   The cool little deck gets really crowded on game-days and sometimes on weekends as well. It can be tough to get a drink up there, but no matter, just grab one from the friendly bartenders downstairs before you head up.    If you are looking for a cool little unpretentious watering-hole, you should give it a try."}
{"text":"Gin Mill always has friendly bar staff, and it's almost never empty.  Their 24oz PBR tallboys are $2.00 or so, which is perfect for the economical drinkers out there.  They have darts, fooseball, shuffleboard, and a nice little rooftop lounge area with cornhole.    Weeknight events include trivia, live musicians, Wii Sports on their projector, Karaoke, as well as the occasional DJ!  The crowd is typically young and chipper, and prices are great.  I've even left my credit card here overnight once, and was delighted to see no surcharges were applied in penalty."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink with some friends. Cool people and nice bartenders. Hint hint if you are going to sing Karaoke be prepared for a very very small selection of songs. Come on who doesn't have Summer Lovin....its a Karaoke classic. Fortunately I didn't come in to sing Karaoke so I wasn't that disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Definitely not what I was expecting for a first visit, but its definitely a decent South End bar.  Plenty to do, plenty of places to chill, and TONS of booze/beer behind the bar. I really dig the giant tables with old church pews near where they put the bands.   Really dig that they have darts and some other video games, too.   The only part that freaks me out, like many other spots in town, is the parking situation. Just a little scary and not sure \"where\" to leave the car. Ya know?  It's a great spot and the beer is cold. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had never been to Gin Mill's previous location, so I can't compare the new to the old. With that being said, I ended up here on a Tuesday night and grabbed a seat at the bar with my friend. We shared the tempura chicken fingers and a make your own flatbread with chicken, bacon and mozzarella as our toppings. I liked the unique twist on the chicken tenders as these seemed lighter and crispier than your typical breaded tenders. The ranch and honey mustard that came on the side for dipping was delicious! The flatbread pizza was good, but not great. The chicken seemed to be slightly over cooked and cut into too large of chunks for the pizza.  I would suggest trying one of their already created flatbreads which are probably better thought out and taste tested. They are opening the rooftop bar in about two weeks, so that definitely sets them apart from most bars in southend. Also, there is an extensive amount of tvs with ample space to make this a perfect location for watching sports or grabbing a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I went here to check out the new location, it was definitely a step up in square footage. They had more and better games. The live band was very good. My only complaint is that there is no longer the roof top bar/area!"}
{"text":"Not a dive anymore. Great place with multiple TVs to watch whatever game is one. The food was delish as well."}
{"text":"The new Gin Mill was just alright today. The building and space is nice. It's not massive inside, but there was a decent amount of room with a small upstairs section. Food prices and drink prices were pretty reasonable. The food was what was lacking. I got buffalo wings. They were a little dry and overcooked. It's an extra charge if you want celery and carrots. They came served with ranch. The strange part was the wings were served with the wing tips still on. This is a totally useless part of the wing that is not worth the extra biting. They were not spicy at all. My girlfriend ordered a wrap, and was given the wrong one. The bar staff was friendly and attentive. Have to go 3 stars based on the quality of food and the mess up, but if going just for drinks it's a solid pick with tons of TVs."}
{"text":"Relaxed bar atmosphere! The rooftop deck is pretty amazing and can offer views of uptown. They run killer specials on Jameson!"}
{"text":"A bar near uptown Charlotte that is no frills, has no dress code, and no attitude?  It does exist and it's called the Gin Mill.  If you are a transplant from any blue collar city, the Gin Mill will make you feel at home as it is reminiscent of bars in those cities.  They have shuffleboard, darts, and a few other games.  They also have some killer beer specials every day.  There is a nice rooftop bar that used to have a great view of uptown until they built the condos across the street.  They don't serve food, but Tavern on the Tracks is in the same building and serves a full menu until 2.  Come here to escape the yuppies, botox, and cougars that are so prevalent in the QC."}
{"text":"Dart boards, shuffleboard table, and a Foosball table line the back of the place. A slew of video game machines to keep you mildly entertained for a good half hour. The dance area is elevated a foot from the main floor and the bar is behind it. Your standard selection of liquor and beers and decent daily specials.   This place is so-so in my books of bars. Very casual and during the summertime you can come here and head up to the roof and just relax. And that's what the place is. A relaxer. Seems more like boozed up coffee joint to me. The bartenders are helpful and the bouncers know when to kick \"that\" person out.   If you want a relaxing night out and not get dressed up for anywhere else, then come on over to the Gin Mill. Otherwise, you have plenty of other selection in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I came here when I was in Charlotte visiting some friends.  The bar was okay.  The bartenders were a little limited in their knowledge of drinks.  Nothing really stood out about this place.  The music seemed to be piped in over satellite radio and was pretty tame.  They had darts which were nice.  It's not like I have anything bad to really say about the place.  I just have nothing good to say about it either."}
{"text":"Went in there with my girl before a concert at Amos' last weekend. Two vodka cranberry (wells) and two Washington Apple shots (well liquor again)...$27. Are you f'n kidding me?!?! $7 a shot a $6.50 a drink is really steep, especially for such a chill place like this. Never again."}
{"text":"I've been in Charlotte 2 days, and have been to 3 bars, and they were about all the same.  However, this  place had a significantly better beer selection, and they also had a Woodchuck cider (gluten-free) that  I could drink!  I had 3 of them :P.  They had a great, bad 70s cover-band...nothing like a live band, cider, and women's curling!!"}
{"text":"I heart Gin Mill.  It is an unassuming we're not serving you food lets play darts kind of place.  They have a big screen for watching games and a pretty decent DJ on the weekends.  Drinks aren't too expensive and everyone there seems pretty friendly.  After a few too many drinks one night I realized they have a popcorn machine with free popcorn.  I may or may not have had multiple bowls and began randomly sharing with strangers.  There's good specials and an abundance of bar games (the only sports I excel at) including 3 dart boards, shuffleboard, some arcade games, and cornhole on the roof.    Check it out if you're in the South End!"}
{"text":"Saturday night, fourth stop of our light rail bar crawl. Friendly door man checking IDs at the door, pretty good crowd already going. Three dart boards, foos ball, and some other games as well as a DJ area with dance-able space made it a great stop for our ever growing group.    Warning, the step after the foosball table is treacherous. Also, you can find some genuinely shady characters sitting at the bar on a weeknight.   For future reference, at only 1.5 blocks from the Bland light rail stop, it's a good stop for a bar crawl."}
{"text":"The new Gin Mill is back open! For those of you who remember the good old Gin Mill, the new one is right next door. New & revised! They did a nice job with the looks of the place. Still has darts, shuffle board, and maybe 3 arcade games. No specials, went on a Friday evening. Paid $6.50 for draft beer. We had fun here, good crowd. The word is out, they are back open! Soft open happened on Wednesday January 10th!"}
{"text":"That's right as you've heard this is a bar where you can grab a drink before a concert.  The crowd here is boring.  I was going to see a Little Brother show next door on a Saturday and I arrived way too early.  There were several football games on in the bar, everyone watched the games, but no one had any real sports spirit to them.  They do have shuffle board and other games and it might be fun with a friend, but the people didn't have any life."}
{"text":"I can't really say I loved it but I certainly felt like it would be a great place for a lay-low kind of place to maybe watch a band (as I was there for) or catching a game.  The place is nice and wide open and also has a nice rooftop situation that was refreshing as a break from the dark dungeon style space below.  Dart boards and a spot for bands is basically what you'll notice most.  The bar is pretty large and the bar tenders seemed to handle demand decently.    I'd come back but honestly it's not on the top 5 places for me to hang out at."}
{"text":"When I was first introduced to The Gin Mill, it was over a year ago.  I had gotten the hype from a boy I had just started seeing and he was all like \"The Gin Mill is the best bar in the South End! There's never a cover, they always have a miller lite for $3, and the live music is always kick ass!\"  Well, he was right on...... While it conjures up verbal images of a bar bordering on \"dive bar\" standards, it has become one of my old favorites.  Comfortable, laid back, great rooftop patio, awesome drink specials, incredible bands every weekend, and a place where you can play darts, shuffleboard, corn hole, and bring your own dice! I am a convert and The Gin Mill is one of the places I introduce new folks to Charlotte to as \"one of the best bars in the South End!\""}
{"text":"I will probably not eat here again. I had such high hopes. My burger and everyone else's at my table was charred despite how we ordered it. The fries were also bland without ketchup. Great for BEERS but DO NOT GET A BURGER."}
{"text":"You may want to post that Sunday 4pm opening before 1pm on Sunday. There were people outside expecting Bar to be open with nfl playoffs starting at 1pm. Interesting..."}
{"text":"I went to the new Gin Mill today. I was so impressed by the service ... the bartender, Stephen was amazing and funny. The food was exceptional. The chef (Clayton) brought my food out for me and also suggested the \"boss sauce\" for my wings which I was super impressed with. Great place I recommend it to anyone looking for a clean atmosphere, food and great company."}
{"text":"Have to admit I havent' been here in several years but always had fun at this place.  The owner is a great guy.  They didn't serve food but would order for you next door @ Tavern on the Tracks. Heard they have a nice rooftop view."}
{"text":"Just wanted to do an update on my previous review.  Unfortunately the rooftop bar has been closed so it isn't as convenient to go up there... It requires lots of trips up and down, but it's still rather chill to be up there.  Corn hole, tables and chairs and a nice view still make it a nice hang out spot.  Good thing the downstairs has not changed much.  Plenty to do with darts, foosbal table, bar, complementary popcorn!, shuffle board table (actually one that works!).  There was a live band playing that Saturday night and they really rocked it.  Since I am getting older, I do appreciate less bar craziness and different types of entertainment (other than getting ridiculously drunk).  I guess i spent my 20somethings doing the majority of that and my liver always reminds me that i cannot do that anymore.  The Gin Mill offers a place with more substance and quality crowd (even tho we are older! There's totally nothing wrong with that)."}
{"text":"Perfect dive bar in the heart of south end. Does everything right that so many other places in Charlotte do wrong.   No cover Cheap drinks Great music Chill atmosphere Variety of games Rooftop deck  It's definitely a perfect place if you don't want a ridiculous club atmosphere but still want to party and have a good time."}
{"text":"A simple bar with affordable drinks- a great place to drink prior to a show at Amos.  Rooftop deck and occasionally local bands."}
{"text":"Located next to Amos' Southend, this bar is a nice little retreat if you're looking to get out of Amos' for a bit.  I was at Amos' for a concert one night & was tired of the opening act. So my friend & I headed over to the Gin Mill to check the scores of the game before the main act came on stage. From the moment we walked in, you could tell this place was a sports bar. This probably had to due with the fact that they are a Notre Dame friendly bar, & the Irish were playing, but it still was a very lively atmosphere. With plenty of tvs throughout the place, there wasn't a bad seat in the house to catch the game. I'm not sure if it's always as crazy when the Irish aren't playing, but it was great when they were.  While it was a short trip to the Gin Mill, I think it's a great little bar to check out if you're at Amos' and tired of that scene. You can pop into the Gin Mill pretty quickly & grab a drink. And if the Irish are playing, look out."}
{"text":"Mmmm inhale that smell of fresh popcorn! Not gunna lie a bar can totally buy my affection with free food, especially warm, salty, comforting popcorn. You don't even know you have the drunk munchies until you smell it and then it is game over. Munch away.  Let me put my imaginary popcorn down for a moment to talk about the rest of the bar. We walked over to this place after our whirlwind South End brewery tour.  We went to the bar and my companion ordered a whiskey and I ordered a beer. The bar had a really good selection and the interior was clean. Though the bar was crowded the bartender was quick and efficient. Prices weren't bad either.   After we got our drinks we headed to the rooftop. We passed patrons playing all sorts of games which gave the bar a nice laid back feel.  Not a bad view when we got to the top but not a lot of seating and it was definitely busy around 10pm on a weekend. While there was some variety the majority of the patrons looked about like what you would see at a college frat party.   It was a fun bar and I look forward to returning the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"This is a simple and low key neighborhood bar. They occasionally have local bands who are always very solid. It is a great bar for a low key night of a few beers and wanting to hang out with friends. They also have a ton of bar games which is always a fun time. Now that the weather is getting nicer i am going to have to check out the rooftop that i hear so much about."}
{"text":"I don't understand why Gin Mill gets a bad rap because honestly it's a great little dive. Small, friendly, and fun. I especially like it when they have some live music and they always have some tasty specials (they do some unique cider drinks in the fall). They have a few dart boards in the back providing some additional fun. I never understood why people do not utilize their rooftop bar, which is great in the summer."}
{"text":"I will have to be honest; this place would easily be a 2-star establishment if it wasn't for their awesome rooftop terrace! The rooftop allowed for a fun experience, and includes cornhole. The downstairs has a shuffleboard and darts, which also added to the night.  Gin Mill, I want to like you. However, I've had your local brews on two separate occasions, and on both occasions the beers tasted bitter and stale. I suppose the 'run of the [gin] mill' crowd doesn't dig local draughts, but that doesn't excuse you from checking on the kegs every once in a while!   All in all, 3 Stars."}
{"text":"Their new spot in south end is pretty awesome. Been there a few times for food/snacks, foods great! Also live music on the weekends, one Saturday night I was in it was a bunch of awesome '90s covers."}
{"text":"First off, this is the first review I've ever written on this site. I've never had an experience that I felt the need to write about, and I felt that everyone else covered everything in this city pretty well. After tonight, I felt the need to post my opinion about this place. I use this site plenty for checking out new restaurants and bars and I hope people read my review as a warning too.  I will start off by saying that I went to Gin Mill tonight specifically to play trivia with a group of friends who go there every week. Last week the team came in first and won a $20 gift certificate. Tonight, our team came in first again and we won an additional $20 gift certificate and even a \"free\" round of drinks. Nathan Richie runs trivia and he is a stand up guy who spent a good bit of time with us after the game chatting and just being really friendly. I think he's great and I love the game he ran.  The trouble came after he left, at the close of night when we closed our tab. We came with a group of five, 2 of which weren't even drinking. Our drinking was broken down pretty easily... We won a round of 5 Blue Moon beers (again, 3 of us were drinking, so 2 of the 5 freebie beers were redistributed between the 3 of us)... As for paid beers we had the following:  Me: 3 Miller High Lifes, 1 Blue Moon Person #2: 3 Blue Moons, 1 High Life Person #3: 2 Blue Moons, 2 High Lifes For a grand total of 5 Miller High Lifes and 7 Blue Moons to pay for.  We also had our 5 \"free\" Blue Moons, so we had a total of 17 beers between the group.  We went to pay our tab at the end of the night, and we had a $20 gift certificate for placing first in trivia the week before. We figured that would cover the bulk of our beers, so we didn't bring much money. We were presented with a tab for 12 Blue Moons and either 6 or 7 High Lifes (I don't remember which number it was as I was more focused on the extra Blue Moons, since High Life was only $2). We argued with the bartender that it was way wrong and that he was charging us for our free round of Blue Moon (since we DID drink 12 Blue Moons, but 5 were supposed to be free due to trivia that night) and he claimed that he already took 5 off the tab.   The bartender was accusing the three of us of drinking 22-23 beers between us, which wasn't correct in the least. We tried to argue with him. When we closed my girlfriend was with us and she was one of the 2 people who didn't have an ounce of alcohol to drink... She could even recount how many beers we had and knew that we were being accused over 5-6 beers more then we got.  What was great is that we asked if anyone else had ordered drinks on our tab and he said \"maybe when you first got here,\" which alarmed us. The entire night we only had 1 person order drinks for our table the whole night. No one else went to the bar to order a single drink for us.  He wouldn't listen to us and eventually we got him to take our freshly earned gift certificate from trivia that night (one that we planned to use next tuesday) towards the 5-6 extra beers he added to our tab.  I loved the trivia and the guy who ran it was great, but the bartender is either an idiot or decided that he didn't agree with how much money he was making that night and thought he could squeeze an extra $20-30 out of a group."}
{"text":"At first I wasn't sure why my friends always wanted to come here, but I quickly learned its one of the most hopping places in south end Charlotte. Lots of games to play in doors and out, free popcorn, live music, and a rooftop bar. It's a little divey and dress is definitely casual, but once you get past that it's a great time!!"}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite bars in CLT. The place always has energy flowing through it even on a weeknight. A nice beer selection on tap including Angry Orchard, Purple Haze and Greenman. It's good to see a small local joint that mixes up their taps and doesn't just have the standard Bud and Miller on draught. Good number of bottles as well so easy to find a favorite.   The place is a very laid back feel and the doorman who checks IDs (never a cover charge) has always been incredibly nice. Steven is usually behind the bar slinging drinks which is a very good thing. I've become a regular here and he's great at taking care of our group.   The rooftop is great to grab some air and is typically less crowded than the downstairs on Fridays and Saturdays. They have a rooftop bar but sometimes it's open and sometimes it's not. Cornhole on the roof and darts, foosball and shuffleboard downstairs for your entertainment. Seems they always have live tunes on Saturdays and occasionally on Fridays as well - never heard a bad band here and best part is the band is obviously loud but it doesn't overtake the entire bar - I can stand over by foosball and here what the person next to me is saying - feel like that's a rariety for a lot of bars!  Warning though the bar gets beyond packed after 11 or midnight on the weekends - can make it hard to get another drink or your tab at that point so you may wanna double fist and pay as you go. And if that's not your scene, just duck out early. Parking can sometimes be a pain and you'll drive around for 10 minutes looking for a space but just know that the Gin Mill is definitely worth the effort."}
{"text":"I am a little partial to this place due to fond memories.  So my review my be biased.  There is an upstairs patio outside and a downstairs near the bar.  I prefer the upstairs and the view.  It is really nice to sit outside and have a drink on a summer, spring, or fall evening.    The service is ok.  Some of the staff is a little rude at times.    There is an area to play games inside which is cool.  It doesn't get too crowded and you don't have to wait too long for your turn to play.   Drink specials on various nights.  Check them out!!"}
{"text":"I came to Gin Mill on a Saturday evening. I was so impressed by their new location! The new space has a sleek and inviting design, and they have an awesome outdoor space.   The layout of the Gin Mill is so well thought out - they have placed the bar, dance area, tables, and restrooms in a way that flows very well. The DJ was rocking, and they had the windows open to let the spring, air inside. Customers are mostly 22-30 range in age, and dressed casually (jeans to dresses are fine). This place is well located in South End, and is a great place to spend a fun night out. Bar prices are reasonable, and they don't have a cover!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Gin Mill South End a couple of times over the years and always had a decent time.  To me the place feels like a great local dive bar, which I like.  There are dart machines, Golden Tee, and even karaoke.  Based on my visits, there always seems to be a good vibe and the people I interact with are always friendly.  Parking can be a pain, but worrying about being underdressed is not.  There is no need to put on airs.  Atmosphere - Casual neighborhood bar, a dive bar without as much disrepair as the name would normally imply, the college crowd and older folk hangout in harmony       Service - Friendly and prompt  Overall - The Gin Mill South End is a great place to meet up with your friends to start off your night or in my case a great place to end the night before heading home."}
{"text":"Only been there once. Wasn't too impressed with the place. Was expecting more of a \"Gin Mill\" than a dive bar.  They had a band there, not bad, but the stage is the seating area. Didn't help that the sub was standing amongst the crowd, due to the minimal space.   They had a pretty good selection of beers on tap, but the whole time I was scurred because I haven't had my tetnis shot lately.   They could do more with the minimal space, was a little dissappointed.  LBD scale: 3."}
{"text":"I personally really like this place! I visit it often with coworkers and friends and it has a great view of the city. I love how it has a rooftop with ample seating and a small bar upstairs. The one downfall I have about this place is sometimes the music is so loud it's difficult to have a conversation. They lowered it once for us because it was the early evening and we were yelling in order to talk. So I'm glad they lowered it.  One thing to note, you have to have a $7.50 minimum for credit card purchases so if you want just one drink, remember to bring cash or you'll buy more then you want to reach the minimum."}
{"text":"One of the stops on the Light Rail Bar Crawl, I felt that the Gin Mill was the most \"dive-y\" with a lot of dented chrome and scarred wood a bathroom that needed a flamethrower and some seriously loud music. I sat at the bar with my beer and watched the young-uns dancing to the DJ's tunes on the \"stage\". This vantage point gave me a great opportunity to see the bartenders in operation. Fast, efficient and friendly. Picking up abandoned empties and serving out drinks quickly. Impressive.  Bouncer at the door checking ID's. Taxi stand outside ready to take the wobbly folks home, but I was good. It's a very short walk to the Light Rail station that gave me time to sober up (I only had four drinks over five hours) while riding back to my parked car."}
{"text":"Quite a pleasant surprise to the other bars in the surrounding area! In the summer check out the rooftop patio that includes an amazing view of the city during late night hours. When we initially went here we figured it would be a hole in the wall with decent prices. Fortunately after a few drinks at the apartment and venturing uptown to a couple of bars it was refreshing to hang out in such a quaint spot. The bartenders were both interested, friendly and helpful AND serve up some fantastic beverages. The late night Saturday DJ is a local, but really brings the best beats.  To reiterate I recommend coming to this bar on a weekend night to chill out and have a pleasant time."}
{"text":"Do you remember when bars were actually bars? Not \"sports\" bars or lounges or brew houses or any other such nonsense. I'm talking about real bars with dark interiors (especially during the middle of the day), games to amuse yourself while drinking (pool, darts, etc.), and a casual atmosphere where you could strike up a friendly chat or be left totally alone.  Gin Mill is one of those few places. It's not a seedy dive, so you don't have to bathe in Purell afterwards, but it's beautifully old school.  I've been there after a show at Amos' Southend or in the middle of an all day beer crawl and no matter what it's consistent and comfortable.  They even have popcorn as a free snack which is a million times more sanitary than beer nuts (just remember to use the scoop, you drunk bastards).  I'm happy that places like the Gin Mill are still around. Unpretentious, relaxed bars that let you enjoy a beer and forget about the outside world."}
