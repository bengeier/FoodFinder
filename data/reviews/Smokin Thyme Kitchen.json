{"text":"My wife and I love Smokin Thyme Kitchen! The owner, his wife, and staff are super-friendly, and they deliver delicious food.  We have had the brisket sandwich, the pulled turkey sandwich (three times), the burger (two times), the beignets, the Cajun fries, and their Nicaraguan coleslaw (two times).  All of the items are outstanding, but our favorites are the burger, the pulled turkey sandwich, and the coleslaw.  The burger comes with free bacon, lettuce, tomato, jalapenos, and some other toppings for one flat rate of only $3.50.  The toppings are large and very fresh.  The pulled turkey sandwich really melts in your mouth.  I would recommend adding the Carolina sauce to this sandwich for extra flavor, but you can still eat it without the sauce and still love it.  Lastly, we really enjoy the Nicaraguan coleslaw because it is so unique.  For example, it does not have a mayo base to it.   Also, it just has a very good homemade taste.  If you are looking for some really good food that is inexpensive and made with a lot of love, then you must check out Smokin Thyme Kitchen.  We will be back there again before the summer is over."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had. Service is awesome. Love the people there. Try the black bean balls."}
{"text":"We've been here twice since Father's Day 2017, but unfortunately won't be returning again. The burgers are really awesome and cheap, but mediocre service cancels them out. This place doesn't seem to have regular operating hours. To make sure they were open on Father's Day, we called the number on their Facebook page. It ends up being an out of service number. So we go to their website, where a different number is listed. No one answers. Ok so they're closed, nbd. But then we see they posted on Facebook saying they were opening at 1 pm that afternoon. We showed up about 30 minutes after they posted that  and it was closed. A woman came out and apologized profusely and said they were closed because they were out of food. Not sure why they'd post saying they were open when they didn't have food to serve. We decided to give them another shot and came back that evening and ordered burgers, fries, and fried pickles...everything was awesome!   So awesome that we decide to put in an order for takeout a few weeks later. First, according to their hours online (although their website and Facebook page both have different hours listed) they should've been open by 11 am. But we call around 4:50 pm and a guy picks up and says they won't be opening for another 10 minutes...then just hangs up. Annoyed, we call 10 minutes later and put in our order. Multiple sauces are out of stock, but that's it. Again no big deal. But when my fiance goes to pick it up. The phone is ringing non stop and the voicemail is playing out loud for everyone to hear. It keeps ringing and the woman helping customers says loudly \"Ugh I wish we could put the phone on mute!\". Clearly they don't care that customers are either trying to find out their hours OR put in orders. After he pays, the woman tells him they were both out of the sauce he ordered and weren't able to make the fried pickles so she took them off his order. He had just paid and was literally about to turn around to leave. So she charged him for food they didn't even have. To accept an order, not have the food to make it, and then not say anything until right when we're about to leave is UNACCEPTABLE.  What kind of service is that? She didn't even offer an apology. Additionally, we overheard another customer ask what their hours were. The woman who helped us said \"Ummm we hope to close by 11 tonight. We like to do 11 to 11.\" Clearly they don't stick to that. With a storefront in a great Lakewood location, how could you not take advantage of that and have set hours so people can frequent your business?! But fine, we get home and eat. My fiance's burger was great, as usual, but the fries and mac and cheese balls were inedible. Similar to what another reviewer said, and Cleveland Scene's review of this place, there is  something is really really off with the oil they use to fry food. It tasted rank, and kind of like greasy movie theater popcorn.   From our interactions with their staff it seems like these people have never run a restaurant. Which is fine! But they did not win us over as customers in the long run. With no consistent hours, ways to get in touch with them (different phone numbers listed online, different sets of hours listed), and poor customer service I just don't want to waste our time or money here again. I never leave reviews for things, let alone negative reviews, but I really had high hopes for Smokin Thyme."}
{"text":"Great burgers for super cheap! Wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to get them but if you're in the neighborhood it's a great place to stop and get quick cheap good food. Fries were good however the oil they were cooked in made them taste old...but actual fry was good. Very nice owners who don't know what they got themselves into but took a leap of faith and I think that's super cool and brave! Support local restaurants!"}
{"text":"Tried Smokin' Thyme for the first time this past weekend. My husband and I both had the smoked turkey sandwich and a side of Sweet Potatoes fries. Portions were perfect, not too big, not too small. I had the Original sauce which was a great first try, my husband had Carolina which he really liked. I would recommend a small side of your sauce if you want a bit more for dipping  It was fantastic. The price was great, it was quick from ordering to actually receiving food, and the customer service was fabulous. They seem like they are truly excited to be part of the neighborhood and we are really excited to support them!"}
{"text":"The $5 burger and fries might be the best value I've ever gotten from a restuarant. The burger was delicious. I can't wait to try out the different combination with their specialty sauces. The staff was very friendly, even though they were very busy."}
{"text":"Amazing! Prices are great and food is delicious! Southern fried chicken sandwich is definitely the way to go. We'll be back often."}
{"text":"Saw this place was new and hadn't tried it yet so Stopped in to grab food for dinner. Was not disappointed! The prices are great and the food is even better!"}
{"text":"Everyone there was nice but the food was just OK. Had a cheeseburger with assorted toppings, mac and cheese balls and cajun fries. The burger was good, albeit greasy but the price for the burger was awesome. The cajun fries were also really good BUT the mac and cheese balls were inedible. I don't know what it was fried in or rolled in but the taste was WRONG. So take my advice and avoid that at all cost. Would I come here again? Maybe for the fries after a night of drinking, otherwise, Lakewood has too many better options."}
{"text":"Food is great! First i was giving five stars because the food is good and was ready quick! I then was going to only give 3 because they forgot an order of fries and cole slaw, but then they proved that they deserved 5 stars by making everything right. My new favorite burger place for sure"}
{"text":"Tasty burgs. Really crispy fries. Delicious special sauces. The three pillars of a burger joint. Love these people. Husband and wife owner operators. Can't beat this place."}
{"text":"Whether you're longing for a pulled turkey sandwich (stuffed to the brim!) or a juicy burger, look no further. Incredible prices (please don't change this!), mouth-watering sides (hush puppies!), toppings for your sandwich (FREE BACON... WHAAAAT??), and friendly service. Dine local. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"The wife and I headed up to try the burgers as we had heard they were good and prices were cheap.   We ordered a Bacon mushroom jalape√±o cheeseburger, a Mayo mushroom cheeseburger, a smoked turkey sandwich, beer battered Cajun fries, and mac and cheese balls.   First thing I can say is the cheeseburgers are $3.50 flat with any toppings you want and whichever sauces you want. The cheeseburgers are descent. If I was in the area I would stop and get one, but I wouldn't drive very far to go there specifically for something to eat. The smoked turkey sandwich was very tender and moist, but had way too much seasoning ( salt and pepper, especially the pepper) and no real smoke flavor at all. The beer battered Cajun fries are really wedges with way too much batter that tasted like old fryer oil and the potato portion was gummy not flaky. The mac and cheese balls really tasted bad as still the old fryer oil flavor along with some processed flavor. The coating on these is similar to a hush puppy consistency not a normal batter or breadcrumb type, kind of weird.  The place is simple asthetically, but it works for what it is, and the people behind the counter seemed very nice. If you live in the area, it is fine for a descent cheap cheeseburger, but I wouldn't recommend the sides other than maybe french fries and hope the oil in the deep fryer is fresh."}
{"text":"Great, thoughtful service. Yummy, cheap eats. And vegetarian options. You can't go wrong with this burger joint. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great value. Burger is solid. Beignets were fantastic. Needs improved ventilation and the mac and cheese bites were bland. But a very solid bang for your buck! Will go back!"}
{"text":"We came out from Elyria to try the French Quarter Doughnuts after seeing a pop up  from Yelp on my phone. We ordered both the Cinnamon and the Powdered sugar. The presentation was spot on. They were perfectly coated with their toppings, freshly made and still very warm. However they were over cooked and chewy. If it weren't for the sugars dusted on the tops I would have thought they were just fried dough. Not sweet or \"doughnut-y\" at all. Disappointed we made the trip."}
{"text":"We gave Smokin Thyme two shots. Both times, good service and good burgers. BUT both times... the order has been messed up (even when it was written down on paper and given to them.) I can forgive that, but I can't believe the hush puppies and fries that we just got. The oil has to be beyond bad. The hush puppies were completely charred and black, and left an awful after taste. The fries had the same disgusting odor, and old burnt oil flavor. I've heard about old oil here before, from reviews and an article. I figured that after that, it would be something that they were very wary of and keeping an eye on. I'm very sad that I fed this to my parents. :( I just got done bragging about all the good food places around here... and now they think I'm a sham."}
{"text":"A fast, no frills place to grab a delicious burger with all the toppings you could want for around $5.00. Fresh ingredients, tasty sides, and several house-made sauces to choose from. We like to stop here before heading out of town on road trips."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last week.  The burgers are fantastic, love the simple menu.  Tried several different toppings and cheeses already.  All the different homemade sauces I've tried so far have been great.  The value is awesome too, I would recommend getting two patties though."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic! And the food was even more fantastic, definitely recommend for a quick eat"}
{"text":"Tried Smokin Thyme and had a good experience. Focused menu of a few items with very reasonable prices. I tried the pulled turkey sandwich which was a generous portion of very moist turkey on an egg bun. Had the bourbon BBQ sauce which was outstanding - not too sweet but a nice kick from what tasted like real bourbon added to the sauce. The sides were crispy outside and fluffy inside. They had a slightly different flavor due to being cooked in coconut oil. Service was prompt - you order at the counter and they'll bring out the food. The staff was eager to please. The place is new so there may be a few bumps along the way, but I hope they succeed."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the neighborhood.  My first visit was today and I tried a cheese burger, with an extra patty.  I also added bacon, and grilled onions which of course I expected to be charged for, but upon checking out I was told \"toppings are included\".  The burger on an extra soft bun was fantastic.  In addition to the standard ketchup, they also offer a number of flavored BBQ sauces.  I opted for the root beer version, that had just the right amount of sweet and spice to it. Service was exceptionally accommodating.  I called my order in and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  I asked if they could push that back a bit and was greeted with \"of course, just tell us when you would like it ready\".  My burger was just coming off the grill as I arrived.  Great food, wonderful, friendly service,, and an excellent bargain.  Run, don't walk to get there."}
{"text":"I'm being a little generous with the four star review. Cons: went to this place once and called twice and they were out of the pulled smoked turkey. When I went the first time it was around 12pm and they were also out of almost every food item except cheeseburgers and French fries;I called later that evening to order a sandwich for my husband and his friend who was helping us out, as they told me the turkey would be restocked, but they were sold out again. The other downer is that the french fries tastes a little weird...kinda like hotdogs? I appreciate them going the \"homemade vibe\" type of way, but their not quiet up to par...Pros:So...I went the blackbean burger route and it was actually very tasty;it's like I never knew a veggie option could be so good...it could have been better if they would have remembered to add the BBQ sauce. Tonight my husband ordered the hamburger, which he said was ReAllY GOod! His only complaint were the French fries;he said the oil they used on the fries were no good. I had the pulled turkey sandwich, finally and the meat was very good quality, however they forgot again to add the ingredients I asked for, but that may have been because I was disconnected and had to call back. Even without the condiments it was very delicious! I think the problem is the food is selling so fast they are learning they underestimated how much food they really need...but that could be a good sign bc they have a lot of business. The staff there are very friendly and truly want to make the customer happy, not to mention that have awesome prices. That goes a long way in my book. With a little more improvements I think I'd rewrite my review and give them 5 stars. They have potential!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and sides (fresh coke slaw, yummy thick fries) for a GREAT price. Awesome homemade sauces."}
{"text":"Lakewood's newest kitchen promises to be one of my new favorite burger joints.   The menu is mouth watering, uncomplicated and offers a vegan option. I came in the middle of a lunch rush and got to enjoy watching the calm and courteous line cook interact with the crew under pressure.  It's refreshing  to see the personality of their management.  Service was fast and friendly despite the pressure of the lunch rush with a line out the door. Some unique offerings are fried mac and cheese balls and sorbet.  I will be back to work through the rest of the menu soon!"}
{"text":"Wow this stuff is spot on! I went in for dinner tonight and got a burger and fries. I was able to put any toppings I wanted with no charge and they had a plethora of sauces to choose from! The fries were great and the burger was awesome! I was amazed when my bill was only $5.00? That's unheard of, so I had to go ahead and try the handmade sorbet! Absolutely GREAT! If your ever in the area, I suggest stopping in and trying them out!! The staff was also super friendly, they even gave my dog a \"to go\" container with some smoked turkey in it! Lastly I'll add..... the friend that I met there tonight is the biggest food critic I know of, and he's already called me raving about it, planning on grabbing lunch there often!"}
{"text":"Literally sitting in here now trying not to throw up. The food is well within its value range. The burger was unseasoned and less than appealing. The fries were under done and the Mac and cheese balls were the worst I've ever had. The food has the strangest aroma ever. I can't get past the smell to even eat this. I will not ever return. I want to throw up and reset my lunch."}
{"text":"Picked up up the following for dinner and few snacks to try...service was very friendly throughout the experience:  Burger w/Monterey jack, bacon, pickles and lettuce...decent, but definitely better with the OG sauce Cheese balls...different taste, almost like the oil had not been changed.  Fried pickles...ok but the oil they were fried in didn't taste right  All in all I will try again, but wouldn't be my 1st choice."}
{"text":"WOW!  One of the best burgers that I've ever had! Dave, his wife, and staff were so kind, personable, and welcoming. They allowed me to try any of his original recipe sauces before choosing which one I wanted to throw on my burger. Everything about the burgers, toppings, and sides scream fresh! Best of all, Dave believes in bacon as a topping for a burger and won't charge you extra for it!   A place this delicious and close to me in Lakewood is dangerous!"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad but in lakewood if it's not good there is 5 other place you can go and try. It was average at best but I have a friend that loved it! Met the owner and he was pretty nice, realistic its not a place I'd go back but it's worth a try if you can't find anything at the time."}
{"text":"Great simple burger joint. Tasty food and good prices. The French quarter donuts are a must have too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers and fries. Could be best fries on Madison and the burgers are delicious no frills burgers with perfect soft squishy buns. Love the whole bare bones vibe and the prices are outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Been there twice. Burgers are phenomenal. Great fries, slaw and onion rings. Excellent value."}
{"text":"We went on the grand opening day and were very pleased with the overall experience. We were sad when Chow Chow left, but this place is filling its shoes nicely :)  I had burger with mac n cheese balls and hubby had the smoked pulled turkey sandwich with fries. Prices are extremely affordable (our whole bill was $13).  Definitely an awesome local spot to check out. Food was super fast too so it's good if you're in a hurry but want something better than 'fast food.' YUM! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awsome Pulled grilled turkey burger and fresh cut veggie toppings Mac and cheese balls are pretty Smokey but thats in there name I can't wait to try more there"}
{"text":"Burgers are freakin' awesome and huge- especially for the price! We had the mac-n-cheese balls and the fried pickles, fries, and my youngest had a corndog (hand dipped and fried- looked delicious). You can't beat the prices here and for from-scratch food. Big plus: Bacon added to the burgers for FREE (ya know, like no charge?!?!?!). Crazy... Only complaint, and certainly wouldn't keep us from coming back, is that it was way hot in the place. We were very warm, but not enough to send us running to the door, we ate there. I would suggest just some portable fans in the dining area with the glass up on the screen door, it would move the air around and create a breeze. Super nice staff, the lady with the blond hair and Foo Fighters tee shirt was so nice. We will be back when we come up to Cleveland again, we need a place like this in Columbus (Hilliard area? Hint, hint?)."}
{"text":"All of these positive reviews HAVE to be fakes/friends of the owners.  Tried this place last week after the Lakewood Facebook page was inundated with positive reviews for the place day after day (looking back, that was probably a red flag). Burger was fine, a little small, but it was ok for the price and the fact that toppings are free are a plus. The sides though? GROSS. Beer battered Cajun fries were super oily (with old oil taste as other reviews have mentioned) and 100% flavorless. No salt at all, potatoes inside were gummy, ick. Mac and cheese balls also had old frier taste and were SO DRY.   I never leave reviews, but wanted to offer a truthful one on this place, since so many of the others here seem to offer nothing but unworthy praise.  Try at your own risk."}
{"text":"great burgers and very reasonable prices. i love little local shops like this! will be visiting them again soon!"}
{"text":"I don't get the appeal of this place.  The sauces are pretty good but the burgers are 80% bun with hardly any meat. Reminds me of the old Wendy's commercials. Where's the beef indeed.  At least they were open at least this time.  The kitchen seemed pretty slow and disorganized.  Everyone seemed to wait a really long time to get their order.  TJ butchers Deli next time for sure !!"}
{"text":"For the price the burger is in no way bad, but overall, I'd rather just spend my money at the nearest fast food joint. The hush puppies are chewy. The Cajun fries are not spicy in the least.   Just overall, incredibly mediocre."}
{"text":"First time visit last night. What a great little place. Really great food. Really nice people. Make sure you try it. Great Burger Great Pulled Turkey"}
{"text":"great burgers friendly staff i asked about the taste difference in the fries they where cooked in coconut oil.\  this is the office new go to spot for lunches"}
{"text":"Stopped here after a long day of helping move my daughter to CLE. It was hot, and I wrecked my car... The employees were so helpful and enthusiastic, and the food was delicious.  Our visit there was a great way to turn the day around!"}
{"text":"Super awesome place. Nice and small, friendly staff and the burgers are insane. Super cheap. However the mac n cheese balls are so bad they could really turn a good day bad quickly. They taste like gasoline. However I have a feeling we just got a bad batch because everything else was really great."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was delicious. The black bean burger with bacon, apricot and \"crack\" sauce was divine. Fantastic fries and great service as well. Will definitely be a new regular stop for us."}
{"text":"I'm always so excited to try new restaurants- especially when they're within walking distance from where I live. I had heard such great things about Smokin Thyme and finally decided to head there for dinner last week. I was definitely not disappointed.      First of all- the prices! I could not believe how cheap this good was. For a burger and fries with ANY TOPPINGS YOU WANT (including bacon!!!) it's only $5. Yep, that's a five. The sides were all about $3.       Now for the food. I thought my burger was extremely tasty. I would compare it to Five Guys burgers. For toppings, I got Swiss cheese, mushrooms, bacon, lettuce, and tomato. The fries were also very good. We tried the mac and cheese balls (fried mac and cheese) which I thought were good but would just call them \"mac balls\" because it didn't seem like there was much cheese in there. You can also choose whatever sauce you want for your burger. My boyfriend tried the original BBQ sauce which was good and I tried the crack sauce which I would say is exactly like Cane's sauce for my people who have tried the deliciousness there.       Things we didn't try but want to: they also have \"French quarter donuts\" that you can top with powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar, hush puppies, sweet potato fries, and coffee.       As for the employees, they seemed friendly. We only interacted with the one young guy who rung up our order, but he was polite and answered any questions we had. Our order took less than 10 minutes. We popped in, ordered, and waited but you can also call ahead!       I will definitely be back here. I'm hoping their prices stay low and people frequent this place enough to keep it open. It's definitely a gem!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend eating here. The fries, hush puppies and Fried chicken all tasted like the same thing, burnt grease which also was what it smelled like as you walk in. Other than the burnt grease the food didn't have any flavor at all."}
{"text":"Solid burger and fries for the price. It used to be much cheaper, but the owner must have either 1. Noticed prices were too low to be sustainable or 2. Had low prices initially to bring people in. Either way, it worked on me. Getting whatever toppings I want is nice. I hate seeing extra charges for a certain cheese, veggies, or bacon. The OG sauce is easily my favorite of the sauces. Get it on the side if you can. Getting it on the burger can leave you with less than you want.   Call ahead when you order. Fries and burger are freshly made, so it always comes out hot and ready to eat, but it can take a little extra time. The burgers are fairly thin, but I still thought it was a solid serving. Fries can be very salty. I have had the French quarter donuts but I was mostly unsatisfied with them. They look delicious, and I am a fanatic of the cinnamon sugar flavor, but they are basically hollow and have a very thin wall. I expected a little more \"meat\" to them, but that could just be because I didn't understand what a French quarter donut was when I ordered it. The mac n cheese balls were also a bit underwhelming. There is very little cheese flavor to them. I had these when they first opened, so they may have changed by now.   I'm going to keep going back. It's close to me, is relatively cheap for an entire meal, and I can't get the OG sauce off my mind."}
{"text":"No clue why this place has four stars. The guys working were nice enough, but they didn't say anything about the burger happy hour (we saw a sign on the window after we had ordered burgers and paid for them...I don't think they were discounted) and they didn't give us our drinks until after we had our food and asked for them. The 'cajun' beer battered fries were atrocious. No seasoning or flavor and tasted like soap and old oil. The regular fries were fine and the burger was ok but a little well done for my taste--they didn't ask us how we'd like them cooked. I definitely won't be back and you should go elsewhere if you want a restaurant experience. The place also seemed kind of dirty--the tables were sticky and the floor was slippery. Sad."}
{"text":"We ate lunch here and were very impressed with the quality and portions. A nice size pulled turkey sandwich that was moist for $6, and a burger with any of the available toppings and fries for $5. The staff were exceptionally friendly and you can tell they are excited and passionate about this new business"}
{"text":"Came by this place from the recommendation of a good friend.  Thanks Bill!!  Very small space.  There are 16 seats.  2 4 top tables and the rest are against the windows looking outside.  I went after the lunch hour and it wasn't a problem.  As I looked over the menu I asked what they were most known for and what was most unique.  I was told they are up for best burger and most unique was the pulled turkey sandwich.  I went with the burger since they are up for some award for it.  They have a variety of cheese to choose from with a variety of toppings and sauces.  I went with no cheese, lettuce, onion, pickle, saut√©ed mushrooms with a spicy mayo sauce.  Since I was getting a burger I ordered a small fry to go with the burger.  I was told that the fries are fried in coconut oil so they are healthier than other fries.  Once she said that I immediately smelled the coconut oil in the air.  The burger and fries were served in a brown paper bag.  Once opened the fries came in a cup and the burger was wrapped in paper in a small box.  The burger was tender and juicy and was dripping while I ate it.  The toppings were typical toppings.  If there was spicy mayo on the sandwich I couldn't tell.  Only way I knew it was there is because the drippings were white tinged in color.  The fries were good sized and were crunchy.  I couldn't tell they were cooked in coconut oil.  Overall, the burger and fries here are very good.  Actually, they reminded me of 5 Guys burger and fries.  Served in a brown paper bag with extra fries.  Burger wrapped up.  I'd say the quality is on par with 5 Guys as well.  That's not a knock as I really like 5 Guys burgers and fries as well and eat there all the time.  So I could easily eat here again if I wanted a good burger and fries next time I'm in the area.  Thanks for the recommendation Bill!!"}
{"text":"Really authentic menu! Great staff very friendly and nice! Come out and support them! You won't regret it I promise!"}
{"text":"Their black bean burger is better than many red meat burgers.  Fries and fried pickles were amazing.  I will be back many times."}
{"text":"When I arrived this place was much different than I expected. Just a small one room place with like two tables and a few chairs but with the food, the size is easily overlooked. The burgers have an old school diner feel to them ( but in a good way) just a very classic burger taste, and the sauce options make it fun to dress your burger to your liking. The fries may have been some of the best fries I have eaten. They were so crispy and have a table with vinegar to use on them. Who doesn't use malt vinegar sauce when it's available? But far and away my favorite part of the meal were the French quarter doughnuts. The box came with maybe like 30 of them, and they were gone in less than 5 minutes. They are warm, soft, and addicting. Overall just a unique place with some tasty options."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend for lunch. Very small dining area but it was perfect for what we are looking for. No problem bringing baby in stroller and a toddler.  We both had the puked turkey sandwich. I would recommend getting it with a sauce on it as one of us ordered with sauce on the side and it was hard to get the sauce all over the turkey. The portions are large and the turkey with the OG sauce was very flavorful. The bun didn't hold up well with the huge portion of turkey but they did provide a fork to eat it with.  We also had hush puppies-sick to the sandwich.  Sandwich was about $7 and I think it's hard to find a better sandwich for that price for lunch. If I find myself in the area again for lunch, I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good turkey sandwich with just the right amount of smoke flavor. Got the bang sauce and it was sweet and spicy but not too spicy. Very good portion size for the money. Friendly service. I would come back again to try the burger and French quarter doughnuts."}
{"text":"I had a pleasant experience during my first visit at Smokin Thyme. I'll start off by saying I was mildly confused when I came in and looked at the menu as I had assumed this was mostly a barbecue restaurant based on the name. However, their specialty is actually sandwiches, including burgers, smoked turkey, even some vegetarian options. The woman working at the front (who I later found out is the owner along with her husband who is the cook!) was very helpful and friendly and was able to provide recommendations on request. Based on her high praise for the burgers, I ordered one a la carte along with a side of coleslaw and fried pickles. The burgers are priced very reasonably at $5.50/each with all the toppings you want, or you can opt for the meal version which comes with fries for $8.50. In total my meal only cost $12, which I thought was a total steal for the amount of food I ordered.  The set up of the restaurant is much the same as the old Chow Chow, very fast casual (no restroom sadly!) with a few seats in the restaurant. They aren't set up for dine-in, so although you are welcome to eat in the restaurant, you'll still have your food packed in take out containers. One thing I noticed is that unlike Chow Chow which used almost exclusively styrofoam boxes, Smokin Thyme uses mostly eco-friendly options. My burger was packed with care in paper and a paper box, and my utensils were also made from recycled ingredients. The woman who brought me my order was kind enough to throw in some extra sauces since she knew it was my first time visiting. She included the Creole mayonnaise, the Florida white and the OG sauce.   The burger itself is not at all massive, but in my opinion it's generous for the price. It's more of a smash burger style, and the style almost reminds me of a Swenson's burger although not quite as sweet. The bun that it was served on was really soft, and while some might complain that it was too much bread in proportion to the burger, I personally thought it balanced well. The fried pickles were a bit disappointing for me; they were coated in a tempura like batter and are served as sandwich style pickle slices. All of their fried items are fried in coconut oil, which will certainly lend a distinct taste to the food that not everyone will enjoy. Personally, I didn't mind the coconut oil taste, but I found the batter to be too thick for the pickle slices and really missed that vinegary bite that you typically get with pickle chips. Speaking of vinegary bite, wowee the coleslaw is vinegary! It's definitely not a creamy coleslaw if that's what you were expecting. I didn't dislike it, but I did feel that because the cabbage bits were sliced so finely, the vinegary taste can hit your palate really intensely. I think this coleslaw is best paired with something really sweet such as barbecue to balance out the vinegar forward flavor. As far as sauces go, my favorite by far was the Creole mayonnaise. I wasn't a huge fan of the OG sauce which I found to be really syrupy.  All in all, I wasn't disappointed by Smokin Thyme, but I was definitely surprised by what I found. I would definitely return to try more of what they have, but would mostly return for the burgers over the sides.   TL'DR- go for the cheap burgers, but be aware that some of their sides are non traditionally prepared (fried items prepared in coconut oil, vinegar based coleslaw rather than creamy)"}
{"text":"Ordered tonight for delivery using DoorDash (by the way, they don't charge any delivery fee for the first month after you sign up with them!).   This was my first time trying Smokin Thyme and it was OMG so fantastic! The burger was perfectly cooked and the toppings plentiful. I recommend trying the original (OG) sauce on it, as it was almost like a sweet barbecue that complemented the burger so well! The fries are hand cut and delicious. For dessert, I ordered the French Quarter doughnuts with cinnamon and powdered sugar, and they were amazing! Give this place a try... you will NOT be disappointed!"}
