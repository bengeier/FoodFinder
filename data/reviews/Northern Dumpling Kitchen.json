{"text":"Thanks to all the amazing Yelp reviews, I went and tried this place out. Went there for an early lunch on a Sunday and was promptly seated. Service was fast and friendly. We ordered the soup dumplings, spicy wontons, and pork and leek dumplings. All were very tasty, although they put peanut butter in their spicy wontons which I wasn't a great fan of, but still good.  I do prefer the soup dumplings at Ding Tai Fung better, but overall Northern Dumpling Kitchen is amazing value and quality. We will be returning customers. Definitely go!"}
{"text":"I had beef dumplings I was not to sure about the beef.  My husband had the soup and lamb, which he did not like.  The lamb did not taste like lamb.  We did not like the flavour. We had difficulty communicating with the waitress.  However, the menu was very funny."}
{"text":"Their dumplings are great, service is fast, fairly clean. Their fish tofu hotpot is superb."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place and u was impressed with the food! I got the hot and sour soup which was delicious,  subtle with the spicy and sour flavours but it was there. The noodles were not too soft and complimented the rest of the ingredients in the soup very well; the size is considered big so two people can share it or if you're really hungry one person should be able to finish it as well. The spring onion (spiral) fried pancake was crispy while soft with fragrant spring onions on the inside; not too oily too. The Xiao lung bao (steamed pork buns = 6) were flavourful when served hot, vinegar wasn't needed while eating it; though when it cooled down completely it was really salty. Lastly, the steamed mushroom and pork dumplings were just as flavourful as the steamed buns and it paired well dipped in red vinegar. 

I went around 9:30 pm on a Saturday. During this visit it was very quiet with obly a few customers and the service was quick and polite. The decor was dated design but the area was spacious and the area was clean. The area did not have a lot of divided areas, so the restroom was between the entrance and the cash counter. However, the restrooms were clean and tidy. There is a noticeable sign at the cash front where it says cash only, which is common at most east asian restaurants around the hwy7 Markham area."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I have been there a number of times over the last year and love out special sunday morning trip out to Richmond hill for dumplings at this place.  I like the relaxed atmosphere and that they never kick us (non asians) out even though we literally spend 2+ hours eating. Their soup filled dumplings are the best but other dumplings are equally good. Spicy marinated pork is to die for and we always order two. The soups are good too. 
Post dim sum, there's a cute little cafe across the place for desert!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner because it was one of the few restaurants in the area that was still opened after 10pm. 

We ordered: 
- Steamed mushroom and chicken dumplings. The flavour was lacking a bit and the wrapping was little too thick/doughy 
- Beef onion wrap. This was delicious! It was flavourful and the pancake was crispy without being overdone. 
- Tomato and lamb stew. This was a little disappointing because it wasn't hot enough, taste was off and tomatoes were on the sour side. There was a generous amount of tomatoes and lamb though. 

Overall average. There are better options for dumplings in the area but a meal here is easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"Here for the good food not the ambiance. Comfort food from Northern China. Even my in-laws who make their own dumplings love this place. Coming back again

{"text":"Amazing xiao long bao (soup dumplings)! Very juicy and flavourful. The skin wrap was pretty thin. 

The hot and sour soup has lots of ingredients inside; however, the spiciness had overcome the soup taste.

The filling inside the leek and pork dumplings taste great but the skin wrap was too thick.

Also their spicy chili oil on the table wasn't that good.

Great service. They were fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Good prices, good food, good service. 

We went here on a Sunday night about 9:15 pm. The place was about 1/4 filled. The waitress came quickly within 5 minutes and got our drinks. We ordered the Dan Dan spicy noodle, Li mien, Ma po tofu, green bean, and salt/pepper shrimp. All the dishes were brought out within 110-15 minutes. The odd thing was that the shrimp was cheap (cheaper than the fried green bean). All the dishes were good. While eating, we also ordered some 3 dumplings and 1 beef pancake to take home. 
These were quickly made so the entire time from waking in to leaving was about 30 minutes. Impressive. The entire meal with the take home dumplings and beef pancake cost about $65, which was very good. 

FYI They only take cash."}
{"text":"This place is great.  We found it quite by accident.  The restaurant we wanted to go to was closed and while deciding what to do we walked by and saw people eating dumplings.  Sold! The dumplings were fresh and tasty.  The dumpling skin was just the right texture and the inside was full of broth.  Just be careful so it doesn't squirt all over you.  it was cheap too.  About $4-$5 for 10 dumplings.  We also tried some of the soups, $6-$7, and they were very tasty also.  Nice simple food.  Will definitely go back and try the other dumplings."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was thoroughly impressed. Tasty dumplings, yummy and spicy pork dish. Great place."}
{"text":"Quick hit: great tasting authentic food, bottom of the barrel service.

Atmosphere & service: very tired Chinese restaurant interior decor. Not clean but not dirty. Clearly designed and built to churn turnover in customers. Service is out right horrible. Had to ask for got water 3 times and still got ignored. Had to literally goto the front myself and stand there until I got it. Didn't return with my change, opting to just assume they could keep it as tip (it was over 15% there). I understand you don't goto a Chinese restaurant expecting service, but this was lower than that expectation.

Food: huge contrast to the above. Food came out relatively quickly and hot. The beef wraps tasted fresh and the meat was flavorful. My wife did comment that she would've preferred more sauce. The beef brisket with noodle was average. The beef was delicious but the noodles were bland. The dumplings were chock full of leek flavor which was what we wanted. P.s. I saw them microwave a cup of what looked like soya milk from t&t. So yea... Lower your exp there as well."}
{"text":"Great quality dumplings for a very affordable price. The place is small (10ish tables) but the service is superrr fast. Our first dish came in a minute and everything came in under 10 min. They are also very attentive and takes away empty dishes right away."}
{"text":"Environment -  not much to say on this front.  What you see is what you get. Only reason why this place got 4/5 stars

Service - okay, nothing to complain about

Food - Great dumplings!! And lots to choose from.  Noodles are always very good and very hot, my pet peeve is soup that gets cold after 5 mins of being served.  Must try their cold dishes too, spicy port or drunken chicken.

Pricing - great cheap food. I always want to over order because of how great the pricing is.  Your money goes a long way here!"}
{"text":"Got insulted by the waitress. Never going again!!!!!!!

I asked for a glass of hot water and a glass of cold water because i needed to mix formula for my baby. Right off the bat one of the waitress looked at me funny wondering why i need it and i didnt feel the need to give her a full explaination. By the time she hands me the glasses she said to me\" what kind of mother are you forgetting to bring water for your baby!!\" I told her we ran out if our bottles and there was no need to speak and insult me like that. Whether or not she finds this comment funny, i've never understand why women are not supportive of each other. Regardless of why or what i'm using the water for, this is really none of her business and customers should never be treated like this.

This restaurant is now on my blacklist. Will never step foot again even if its 5min away from home."}
{"text":"I don't know why I have not tried this resto until now as I am always eating in other restaurants in this plaza, but this is definitely on my list of to go to from now on. If you are a fan of any kind of dumplings, you will enjoy this place! 

My friend and I were here from dinner on Friday night. We got here around 6 and it was not packed, but it quickly filled up. We ordered veggie steamed dumplings, pan fried dumplings, soup dumplings and onion beef pancake (all around $5-7/ dish). All dumplings were very fresh and hot and the onion beef pancake was delicious as well. Service was typical, but overall great food, would recommend."}
{"text":"Overall:
4 stars

Parking:
Ample parking in the Times Square parking lot. Can get busy at times, so if necessary, I'll park a little farther. 

Service:
Hit or miss. If you come at a busy hour, expect to either wait or be seated beside strangers. One time I was seated and without even asking me, they sat two additional customers beside me on the same table. The seating and interior is not aesthetically pleasing, so just a forewarning to ignore these issues and focus on the food. Otherwise if it's not busy, you'll find the service to be fine. 

Food:
The food is why I think this place is worth the trip. 
I come often for fresh tasty dumplings, xiao long bao, pot stickers, noodles and veggies. Flavours are good and remind me of food in Asia. One important thing is I don't find the food to be too salty, which has been an issue for me at other comparable restaurants. All of the above comes at a fair price. Speaking of price, they only accept cash. 

Impressions:
I'm a regular here. I will continue to come, but either early evening or after the dinner rush hours."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best places for dumplings in the GTA.  So many different flavours to choose from though the pork and cabbage are my personal fave.  Don't expect fancy decor though.   Best thing is they also offer frozen dumplings you can take home as well!"}
{"text":"Regular custoner at this place? 
Pic personally really like dumplings, their leek, shrimp with chives eggs dumplings are real good! They have a pretty big piece of shrimp in there, but sometimes, they still have a tiny piece of shell, well I'm not that picky so I wouldn't say I'm never heading back just because of this. 
Another dish was the mushroom /beef hot pot? Something like that, it was great they has a lot of beef, but the soup was a bit too salty for my preference.
I'm not a fan of the noodles either, I guess cuz I'm always sticking to dumplings? 
But yeah , for 6.50 and you get 15 dumplings, hard not to be a regular here."}
{"text":"Okay can i say that i love this place? 
I came to this plaza and saw this place was the only place other than richmond court packed to the brim with patrons! this place even attracts foreigners! Thats how you know its good.. Both foreigners and local chinese people know this place is bomb. 

The washrooms werent the cleanest but the service is good! It took a bit of wait for our wooteep and sui long baos to come out, but the flavor was there and we suspect that they hand make them per order! Both the wooteep and the sui long baos were super flavorful and juicy! They also plan when they bring out the dishes perfectly so that they are at the perfect temperature to eat! 

The shanghai stir fried noodles were to die for! Literally so flavourful and a good mix of shrimp noodles choy and others. 

I would 100% recommend. Heck im making plans to come again to try their special menu written in chinese this weekend. Im hoping to try their other speciality other than various dumplings - stewed dishes served in its own hotplate of sorts"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend at work and decided to try it. Was hard to find because its hidden in a plaza but was definitely worth finding. The dumplings have an authentic taste and are obviously made fresh to serve. I ordered lamb, beef, and pork & leek dumplings pan fried. They were all hot and delicious. I can say for sure this place has the best dumplings ive ever had so far. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is too legit to quit!

So, I have a fave dumpling place in Scarborough, and after seeing pics that I posted on Instagram, my friend told me that I would like Northern Dumpling Kitchen better. And I did!

We started with Fried Tofu in Soy Sauce. Everything about this was perfect. I have had too many Tofu Casserole/Hot Pot dishes in the past to count, but there's always something missing flavour wise. 

This was totally on point. The Tofu to Sauce ratio was nice, and the addition of Auricularia (this super cool and weird Jelly Fungi) and Bok Choy made it a complete meal in and of itself.

But of course we got dumplings! Steamed ones with Shrimp and Leek, and Pork and Leek. 

I liked these better than my place in Scarborough because the wrapper and filling are a lot more delicate. Moreover, the Chili Sauce here is the bomb. It has a nice amount of heat to it, and mixed with Soy and Black Vinegar...NOM! 

It's a bit of a trek for this Scarberian, but well worth it for the quality."}
{"text":"Dumplings - Good, lot of flavors, lots of variation, tasted fresh
Cold Potato Thing - Good, this is real Chinese potato thing. Easily best side dish in menu
Beef Wrap Thing - Average, it's a beef wrap alright"}
{"text":"Excellent price for amazing northern Chinese cuisine. Highly recommend their lamb soup noodle."}
{"text":"I was feeling homesick and craving northern style dumplings. Came here on a Sunday night and it was relatively full. I was surprised by their portion size compared to their prices. We ordered two types of dumplings - pickled cabbage with pork and chives with egg and shrimp. Both were very authentic and they really pleased my homesick tongue! The smoked meat with pancakes is a must try! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for over two years now, and even though the service isn't five stars the food is!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, soups are verrrry salty, dumplings, onion pancakes were flavourless. Would not return."}
{"text":"Lamb steamed dumplings tasted more meaty than filler compared to other places."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, specifically because I wanted to try their onion pancake roll with beef. 
My opinion it was amazing. Very tasty and the best one I've tried so far in Toronto. My wife and I also had their lunch specials which wasn't too bad. Average price of 6.99 and comes with either hot and sour soup or soy bean drink. My wife had the kung pao chicken and her only complaint was it could have been spicier otherwise it was tasty and filling. I had the lamb dish which wasn't too bad either, lamb was tender and the sauce went well with it and the rice. Overall the service was good, they seem to have a lot of regulars who frequent the place so that tells you something. 
I will definitely come again to try other dishes on the menu"}
{"text":"Went here for a lazy Sunday lunch and was quite impressed.  The Boyfriend and I love dumplings and it's not too far from Newmarket, so we decided to check it out.  The restaurant was really clean and not crowded since it was close to 2PM.  The menu looks extensive but we ordered from the dim sum menu in the front.  There was tea on the table immediately and our orders were taken promptly.  The food came out fast, and it's really tasty.  We had shrimp soup, the green onion pancakes, Chinese donuts and the shrimp, leek and egg dumplings.  It's a lot of food for not a lot of cash, and that's great.  The only thing you should keep in mind is the shrimp wonton soup also has pork, which we found out quickly when my pescetarian S.O. bit into one.  It worked out all right, but the pork addition is not mentioned on the menu.  Also, service is prompt but after you get your food you need to ask for the bill or to-go boxes.  That said, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Intro'd to Northern Dumpling only recently - how could I not have tried it for so long?! Offering an extensive list of dumplings amongst the usual fare, the very reasonable prices must be a large part of their popularity.  The other part, of course, is that the dumplings are good as they're careful not to make the dumpling wrapping or skin too thick.  My personal favourite pick would be the pork with fennel, served piping hot out from a steamer basket...but at their low prices, why not try a whole bunch of different types?"}
{"text":"They made very good dumplings, great price too. I've tried quite a few different kinds of dumplings, fried/steam/boil and they all are great but that's it, other things on the menu are not as good compare to other Shanghai/Beijing restaurants."}
{"text":"We had the hot pot in summer and danng it was good! I've been here 3 or 4 times and each time we order steam dumplings and pan fried dumplings (oh and the scallion pancake!). My favourite is the leek and pork one. I've also tried the lamb and chicken/mushroom ones but hands down you MUST order the pork and leek. Recently, we tried the beef hot pot with tomato based soup and it was actually really good! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to think when I came here.  There were definitely a lot people but I think the food was only okay.  The noodle with mince pork did not seem fresh.  The minced garlic they sprinkled on top was not even cooked.  The dumpling seemed like they re-cooked it because the skin was definitely dried out."}
{"text":"A solid shanghainese restaurant. Their pastries dumplings are cooked perfectly and quite tasty. The XLB is probably one of the best ones in the area. I also ordered their beef wrap, the wrap is l perfect in texture - flaky and chewy. Service was fast and efficient, and it's probably important to note that this is cash only. I didn't know this prior to coming in so I had to run to the ATM. I would definitely come back to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"My new go-to place when I'm craving dumplings! Love the beef wrap and steamed dumplings. The shanghai noodles are good too and everything is extremely reasonably priced. One order of beef wraps, 12 steamed dumplings and shanghai noodles is enough for two people and under $20! This is not the greatest place for soup dumplings though, there are better places."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic Northern Chinese dumplings. 
The Chinese servers were helpful but didn't really pay attention."}
{"text":"Food was great, I found this place after reading and article on Toronto life about some guy on chowhound that goes around and eats his way around town. This was one of his top restaurants he recommends around the Richmond Hill area. The place is typically packed during the weekend and parking is hard to find within the time square plaza. I actually been here a couple of years back but didn't have a great experience since I ordered the wrong type of dishes. I believe the style is 
Szechuan style so some dishes for me are a bit too potent with a strong spicy and Pepper finish on them. I had the Pork with garlic and Szechuan peppercorn sauce. It in the cold dish section of the menu. I highly recommend it with some dumplings to serve along side of it."}
{"text":"First time here at this shanghai food restaurant. Green onion pancakes were very good.
Boiled Dumplings and fried dumplings were a bit bland. 

First 3 dishes came very fast. However waited another 20 minutes for Shanghai noodles. 

Comparable to ding tai fung and asian legend."}
{"text":"great food. one of the first long time family restaurants of northern China cuisine that's still been around for over 15 + years. food us authentic and good price. my ONLY Complain : the interior is ghetto old. needs renovations. Their 15 + years old neighbor Kim Po has done the renovations thank god"}
{"text":"YAAAAAS dumpliiiiiinnnnngggsssss! Just saying 'dumplings' alone gets me all giddy and excited cuz I LOVE them!!! And it's also a fun word to say LOL!

I came here a couple weeks ago and my friend and I ordered the jelly fish, hot and sour soup and some dumplings (pork and chives and pork and cabbage; both steamed). The jelly fish and hot and sour soup were not the greatest, I'll be honest. I've tasted 100x better than what we got here so if you are considering ordering it, perhaps think twice. It COULD have just been the one off but...to me, how could you go wrong with hot and sour soup, right??? The jelly fish was a bit too crunchy for my liking (I've always had them a bit squishier and chewier) and the soup was generally bland or watered down of a sort. Not even the slightest bit of spicy, maaaybe a bit sour but that's it. The kick just wasn't there... :(

The dumplings on the other hand were pretty awesome. Enough juice, not too thick-skinned and it tasted great! Mmmmmmmm yummyyyyyy!

So that's all! I gave this place a 4 star because it's pretty much more of a dumpling place than it is anything else (even the name says so!) so I will base this rating off of their forté :)"}
{"text":"Northen Dumpling Kitchen is my new fave dumpling place.  Been here 5 times in past 2 months.  Place is pretty small and they are cash only.  Price is very affordable here compare to Den Tai Feng.  10 dumpling for $3.99 !!  We also like the beef roll and onion pancake.  The Pork and Chives dumpling is the best I tried so far. The soup noodles were good as well and portion was decent. I only came here with 2 people each time and wasn't able to try a wide variety so next time I am going to invite my family along so we can get a loads of stuff."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weekday and it wasn't too busy.

Pros:

-Good service
- Well priced
- Food tastes good

Cons:

- Run down ambiance
-  CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"3.5

My boyfriend is from northern China so anytime we go here, it gives him a little memory of home. 
Prices are good and the portion is fair. I like their vermicelli noodles, soup dumplings, and their steamed pork and leek dumplings. 

Their lunch specials are nice because it includes either a hot and sour soup or a cold soy milk. Both are good picks. For lunch, I like the mapa tofu with rice. Ask for extra sauce cause they give you lots and lots of white rice."}
{"text":"In terms of the first impression, it isn't a place that I would frequent at all.  However, I did want to try out this place.  The place looks a little messy and the table was kind of sticky.  I felt that we were being ignored a little since the place was a little busy with only one server.  My friend wanted a cart seat, so we waited for around ten minutes before a table with dirty dishes was clear.  We ordered dumpling, drunken chicken, noodles with the spicy peanut sauce and green onion with beef tendons.  All the dishes were quite good with the exception of the dumpling, the dough was a little too thick for my taste.  The beef tendon dish was really good with aromatic green onions and little spices.  I really liked that dish.  The food did make up for the poor service, so I would come back to this place if I am looking for Northern China food."}
{"text":"This review should be 3 and a half stars.  I was hoping there would be at least 2 vegetarian dumpling options but there was only one - the steamed vegetable dumpling which had napa cabbage, mushroom, tofu and maybe egg.  There were 10 dumplings in each order.  There were okay and will satisfy a dumpling craving in a pinch but definitely not as good as my usual place.

Mr Leny had both the steamed and pan fried pork and chive dumplings, and declared them both excellent.

Each table had both black and red vinegar as well as soy sauce and a really great chili sauce.  Service was very efficient and quick and both servers spoke English."}
{"text":"Dumpling paradise - easily my new favourite dumpling restaurant in Markham. I timed my visit to arrive mid-day since this Chinese strip mall gets very busy (note - there is underground parking). The restaurant looks like most in the area and the service was incredibly fast.

We enjoyed the following:

A) Shanghai noodles - incredibly good and not overly oily. Just a small complaint - I would prefer more mushrooms added to the noodles.

B) Onion Pancake - Comparable to other \"Shanghai\" style restaurants. Not a real standout.

C) Leek & Pork dumplings - so %$#@!&* good I can't explain it. GO TRY THESE NOW!

D) Mushroom & Pork dumplings - Not quite in the same league as the the Leek dumplings but still very good . The dumplings are all made fresh and you can tell with the first bite.

E) Pork & Chive dumplings.... AKA soup dumplings. I love to add red vinegar to every bite. 

We enjoyed a large meal (with leftovers) and the bill was just $30. Great food, fast service and low prices - the perfect trifecta. I will be back for sure.

{"text":"Our favourite dumpling place in Toronto so far. Everything tasted great and was also great value. 

We shared a few things. Dumplings were tasty. Lamb noodles was really good. Also liked the beef soup and beef wrap. 

The place is on the small sIze and there was a wait by the time we had finished. Cash only"}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, fresh, and tasty. Unless you are looking for a posh dumpling experience, this is your choice!"}
{"text":"I would have to say this is my go to place for dumplings. My favourite is the soup filled dumplings and the stir fry green beans and many other items. I DO NOT recommend the general Taos chicken they have here, it is quite disappointing. But then they specialize in dumplings not Americanized Chinese food. Also sometimes they have seasonal menu items written on the white board in Chinese so do ask if not you might be missing out on something really yummy."}
{"text":"Deliciousness at a reasonable price! It's stiff competition in this neck of the woods, but this dumpling joint seems to be a favourite amongst my family (and many other families, judging by the wait at lunchtime). Decor wise it's plain, but the food is what you're here for: dumplings, northern noodles and some delicious hot pot dishes.

You can't go wrong with anything you order here - I've yet to hit something I don't like. All the dumplings were great including the XLBs, the fried dumplings disappeared quickly in our group, and their noodle variety kept us happily stuffed. Essentially, this place is pretty solid.

Make reservations if you can, and carry cash. Parking is also a pain in this mall so be patient!"}
{"text":"With prices and quality like this I would never cook again if I live near here! The price is really cheap here and they sell frozen dumplings you can have this EVERYDAY at home."}
{"text":"I honestly didn't even know this restaurant was here and when we came by, it was definitely as old as I remembered with the previous restaurant. 

They call themselves a dumpling kitchen, but the menu was kind of a fusion between a dumpling house and shanghai food. Two of my favourite kinds of Chinese cuisine in one place would make it a win right away, but the food quality and taste is also important, which I had some high standards and comparisons. 

First off, we ordered some dumplings. We got the Pork and Leek Dumplings that were pan-fried and boiled. Both were okay, but not as good as some other locations. The pan-fried dumplings could have definitely been more crispy.
They had the Pork Hock and Cucumber dish, but it was on the saltier side, with a little too much parsley that it overpowered the overall taste. 
The Xiao Long Boa were larger than other places and had 6 in one basket, which is a plus, and the taste was okay. 
The Shanghai Noodles were definitely non-traditional, as they had shrimp and the taste was definitely lacking. 

Service was about average for a small restaurant like this. I was also surprised to see that there was a lineup throughout the duration of our meal. Guess some people do like this restaurant. 

Some things were okay, but most subpar in my opinion. Comparing to a Shanghai restaurant, or a dumpling house, this restaurant may not be able to live up to either by trying to do both. Unless you want both those food options in one place, I would recommend another restaurants for one or the other."}
{"text":"Very authentic northern chinese dishes, best dumpling in the GTA region by far. I am from China and I can tell their dumpling and pot stickers are on par with local norther chinese restaurants. Besides dumplings, they also have other authentic dishes:"}
{"text":"This is definitely a no frills dumpling house. Food is good and the prices are right. We ordered the soup dumplings, steamed and fried  pork and cabbage  dumplings. Everything came out hot and fresh. Pretty good place if you want to get your dumpling fix. Parking can be an issue as the plaza can get busy on the weekend."}
{"text":"Great dumplings and very accommodating where possible with dietary restrictions. The spicy peanut sauce on wontons is key, would certainly check this out if on the fence"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  It's where we go anytime we crave dumplings.  It's not a fancy place but good food and well priced.  We love the beef brisket soup noodle, soup filled dumplings, steamed dumplings...heck everything is good.  Haven't had something and been disappointed yet.  

We recommended the place to friends of ours who frequent it often as well.  I think there was a bit of construction outside last year and our friends mistakingly thought it closed down.  I was so upset!  We went all over Markham and Scarborough in search of a replacement and nothing hit the spot like Northern Dumpling Kitchen for us.  We were in the plaza for a different reason and realized it was still open!  OMG we wasted 6 months of good eats from bad intel :( but we are BACK! Thanks goodness!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is great. It is delicious! The number one hit in that region. Nothing in Times Square beats this restaurant! Definitely worth a try. The texture and flavour is incredible. It is however, a smaller scale restaurant but who cares, as long as the food is exceptional, it doesn't even matter the size of the restaurant. One of my favourites!"}
{"text":"Don't know how his is a 4 star place.

Food is mediocre at best. In fact the smoked duck dish was so salty and nasty we each had one part and left the rest.

Service is ok, decor was ok, nothing fancy and  inline with this style of restaurant.

Overall I'm rating the place on the food and I most likely wouldn't return."}
{"text":"This place was just overall a great experience. The dumplings were delicious and very well priced, most dumpling dishes at only $3.99. And the service was also good, the waitresses were always alert and quick, but not the sloppy kind. The restaurant itself was fairly small, maybe only about 13 tables ranging from 2-8 people, but it was surprisingly quiet and calm for an asian restaurant. We could even hear the music playing in the background... 
For my table, we ordered 8 dishes, which totalled to around $46, which is a pretty decent dinner for 3. I would totally recommend this place; it's got good value and a good price"}
{"text":"This is my favourite dumpling place in the GTA. It's a small place with 15 or so tables but the food is right. Always get the onion pancake, preserved egg & Tofu dish, and soup dumplings. Everything else is bonus but can be expected to provide great taste. It's very affordable for what you're ordering and a family of 4 can eat a meal easily for $50. I've been coming to this place for years and I can only imagine it'll only continue, it's usually busy on weekends but not overly so that you have to wait a long time to get a seat."}
{"text":"Pros : inexpensive,  fair food, 
Cons: cramped seating,  
We decided to give this place a try as the Yelp ratings were higher than next door Richmond Court.  Not bad but we still prefer the food at RC.  Although always nice to try out new restaurants especially small family run eateries."}
{"text":"Location: 550 Hwy 7 E, Unit 52A, Richmond Hill, ON L4B 3Z4
Price: $-$$ 
Service: ehhhhhhh

This is my favourite dumpling house! It is location at Time Square on highway 7. The food is relatively cheap and the portions are enough to feed two to three people for main dish (ex: Shanghai noodles). 

Very time I visit I will always order the soup filled dumplings! Nothing beats this dumpling... The amazing thing about it, is when you bite into the dumpling there will be hot soup inside- so don't burn your tongue! The dumpling skin is just right not too chewy or mushy. There are other types of dumplings at this restaurant but I find that it's too salty. Other dishes that you should order is Shanghai noodles, general Tao chicken, pork wraps, and bread with onion. 

It only got 4 out of 5 stars because of the service. Sometimes it is really good other times they told care. However, I always want to come back for another visit is because of the soup filled dumplings. Every visit my friends and I always end up in a food coma, it's that amazing. 

Verdict: Go!"}
{"text":"Seems to be my only go to place for dumplings now as they are one of the only places I know where thier dumplings are juicy and not dry.

Onion Beef Pancake Roll
Cold Potato Shreds with Chili Oil n Garlic
***Pretty solid list for a homey feel

Although the food does have MSG, do consider it's a common practise amongst many oriental restaurants to achieve that Umami flavor sensation. Trust me the stuff they put in cheap fast food restaurants will have you downing more water than worrying about MSG.

Service is good as long as you are polite and patiently understand that they do try thier best to communicate in English. It is a mom and pop place so just give them a wave if you need anything, it's not a big deal.

Overall I come to eat here as a comfort meal and I usually head to Tracy after for dessert. Pretty good combination in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food : Average only with MSG making me drink quite a lot of water
Bad Service : Server with bad attitude, appetizer never came even we finish our noodle.  As we were in a hurry, asked the server to cancel the appetizer, and the server always said the chef is already made it. Finally we still needed to wait for at least 5 minutes, finally we had to have the appetizer to take away.  WILL NEVER COME AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this restaurant -- hidden away in the slew of Chinese restaurants in this area this is one of the better choices. All the dumplings I ordered (cabbage and pork & soup dumplings) were hot and fresh with great dumpling skin and flavour. The soup dumplings were half great and full of soup but the other half were only mediocre. I'd also recommend getting the beef and onion pancake wrap dish -- really great and tastes just like home. After ordering 16 dumplings and the wraps our total came out to $17 after tax and tip -- not bad for a dinner for two.

Tip: the restaurant only takes cash but there's a TD atm nearby if you forget"}
{"text":"We went to Northern Dumpling Kitchen specifically for their soup dumplings, but those turned out to be pretty average. We tried a variety of dishes, most of which were sub par, but the winners go to the sliced beef wrapped in scallion pancake (super delicious) and the string beans."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service, however I ordered the chicken dumplings and was not impressed. Will not return."}
{"text":"Decent. Dishes are hit and miss. Xiao long bao is not that good. Shanghai noodles and noodle soup are good tasty. Broccoli with egg has a thick consistency but tasted OK. Desert also (fried egg white with red bean) was not fluffy and very dense"}
{"text":"Greasy and tasteless. Had rice cake, pork dumplings, fried rice over cooked. Beef wraps so greasy and floppy"}
{"text":"My business travel in Toronto became more oriented to the Markham-Richmond Hill area, and I found myself staying in a hotel across the street from a Chinese strip mall center off Leslie Street.  Just returning from Beijing, I was happy to be in the middle of such an intensely Chinese area.  I drove over to this mall with my business associate and started walking around. Lots of shops, restaurants, banks, grocery, etc., and this Northern Dumpling Kitchen.  

I admit to a passion for these dough pockets, and figured this joint had the right name to pull us in for a taste.  First glance was of a quarter circular layout with plenty of tables with window views.  We took one.  Cleanliness wasn't a priority here, but I was used to that coming from BJ.  The menu was multiple pages of dumpling, noodle, and other options.  We were here for one thing, and we ordered (over ordered) 5 kinds of dumplings - steamed, pan fried, and in soup. Good vinegar, sesame oil, and chili sauce are all part of my preparation and we asked for a generous supply, which was provided in a lot of little condiment dishes.  Very cute.

Everything we tried was good to excellent.  The dough was not too thick, but able to hold its contents without leakage.  The pork, leek, veggie, and beef stuffings were all individually discernible, well made, without lumps or unwanted extras to bite on.  The broth was served very hot and steamy.  We were able to adjust the spiciness to our taste.

Bottom line - We totally enjoyed everything, and for a few moments I imagined I was in a Hutong dive eating freshly made little pockets of heaven."}
{"text":"Great variety of dumplings lamb, chicken and beef, bean sprouts and green onion pancakes are delicious!
Parking is a big problem though :("}
{"text":"I got here with a co-worker around 1pm.  The place was packed, but we got a spot that opened up almost right away.  Unfortunately it was right by the kitchen.  It was really humid, so adding that to the hot kitchen, steamed food and hot tea (plus quite a bit of hot sauce), I was sweating up a storm.  There's no air conditioning, just a few fans.  As great as this place is, I would avoid it on hot and humid days.

I followed some Yelp tips and ordered the steamed leek and pork dumplings.  Reviews are on point, these were thin noodled and well seasoned.  Also got the Beef noodles.  Broth was the best part of this, dark and flavourful.  Beef was tender as well, not really chewy like some places.

But the star of the show was the dumpling with soup.  This reminded me of restaurants in Shanghai that I had to line up for 30 mins to get into.  Use the spoon, because when you bite into these the contents will squirt everywhere and trust me, you don't want o lose any of it."}
{"text":"Some tasty Northern Chinese food. Relatively easy to find a seat for an early Sunday dinner, but come 7pm the place gets packed fast. 

Highly recommend the Beef Wrap!"}
{"text":"Typical cleanliness of a Chinese restaurant (not the cleanest) but that doesn't bother me because of this family run business and the prices are so good for the quality of food! 

The lamb dumplings were great the filling was seasoned well and not bland. 
The Shanghai noodles were very good too compared to most places, soft noodles and not too salty. 
The wrapped fried onion pancake thing was the stand out and it was just satisfying to eat that thing! 

All 3 items were $20 together. I love places like this and would recommend and return for sure!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good dumplings for a strip mall. Subtle flavours, equally good without sauce as with. Not instantly addicting like Mother's Dumplings down on Spadina near Dundas, but doubtless more representative of its region's cuisine. I definitely want to go back."}
{"text":"I would say this place is good if you want something more on the greasy side. 

The shanghai dumplings, leek and pork dumplings, and beef fried dumplings all tasted pretty similar. The pan fried dumplings were super oily, and the steamed ones fell flat in flavour. The pork had this distinctive taste that may come out as not fresh. 

Also had the shanghai style jya jang mein and that was decent. Good soy sauce flavour and the cucumbers balanced well with the heavy sauce. 

Their spring onion pancakes were also decent. Surprisingly less oily than the pan fried dumplings. Could use more spring onion taste.

A good place for hangover meals but other than that I wouldn't go back. Maybe it's the things I ordered but for the restaurant to have the word 'dumplings' in it I would've assumed that their dumplings would be the star. Sadly it wasn't.

Lastly, the customer service was sub par. Not much communication between customer and employees. Place was somewhat sticky too and felt dirty for my liking."}
{"text":"not enough air conditioning for a hot day, electric fans are there but unplugged.
the food quality wasn't as good as 1-2yrs ago,  too salty and MSG. we ordered a dan dan noodles, it came up with noodles in spicy soup broth!! oh my!! told the server...she replied that's their style...with new ownership. will not return"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was kid, it's been nearly 10 years. Unfortunately, they just don't make their green onion pancakes the same anymore. It's 95% dough and 5% green onions now.

Their dumplings are top notch though. If you're coming here, you have to try their Shanghai buns (xiao long bao). They have tender meat inside, overflowing with delicious soup.

Wait staff do not speak the greatest English so make sure you make use of the pictures on the menu."}
{"text":"I have been obsessed with soup dumplings ever since I watched Kung Fu Panda. If you haven't seen the movie before, you should - then you'll also love dumplings...

Anyway, I'm so happy I stumbled upon this place, as it was definitely able to satisfy my cravings. The pork soup dumplings were delicious! I also tried some of the steamed dumplings and they were equally great. The service here was also pretty good in comparison to most Chinese restaurants haha. I even overheard one of servers say \"have a great day!\" which I find rare. 

I would recommend this spot specifically for dumplings and only the dumplings."}
{"text":"WARNING?only cash! 
Came here about 3 times on our Toronto trip alone. The interior is very homey, you can tell its family run (mom/pop). 
Personally, go for the more authentic stuff because that's how they know what to make well. Some of the things on the menu, you can tell they tried to appeal to caucasian people, (aka americanizing their food? wait this place is in Canada...) but that stuff just isn't good.
     We had the sweet/sour chicken or something also one time and it was just weird.... 
We got the ???????????????????? (string beans, xiao long bao (lol uhm. soup dumplings? that sounds rly stupid), dumplings, soybean milk, .....beef scallion pancake roll? (wow these foods sound a lot better in Chinese)
Xiao Long Bao, and \"Beef scallion pancake roll\" = a lot more memorable
the soybean milk I liked, but my dad said that it came from a carton, not homemade (I love soymilk in general so I guess I'm a little bias lol)"}
{"text":"The best part of this restaurant is the selection. Yes, they have delicious dumplings but they also have a wide variey of enjoyable dishes. 

The dumplings are hand made which includes the wrapper!

We enjoyed the following item;

Steamed lamb dumpling
Soup filled dumpling
Leek and pork dumpling (steamed)
Steamed Kai lan with garlic (chinese broccoli)

If I had to recommend one dish it would be the soup filled dumplings, although I couldn't help but eye the beef brisket noodle dish on the table beside us."}
{"text":"I'm really torn on whether to give this a 3 or a 4!! It's between there, I'd say- I've read so many reviews on this spot, I had to give it a visit. I luuuuurve dumplings and am always in the mood for them. I happily third wheeled my friends last night to come here and was surprised our hefty meal only cost us $50 taxes in!!

Here was our order-
Xiao long bao aka soup dumplings aka GOODNESS. this is my favourite and fml they were so good, I felt a special kind of euphoria!! Cheap soup dumplings? I'm all about it!! They didn't squirt all over the place (lol stop your mind right now) and burn me so yess. 5/5
Steamed chicken dumplings - quite large but had an off taste to them. eh. 3/5
Steamed pork and leek dumplings - yummy! Tastes way better than most places that make this and overload on the leek. Really juicy too. 4/5
That tin foiled wrap beef roll thing - y'all already know what I'm talking about. This was a treat and my first time having this thing! Not too oily so yay! 4/5
Braised beef noodles - so good, beef was tender and taste was good overall however there's a lot of MSG in the soup. I was thirsty until the AM. 3.5/5

Service is standard Asian service. So it'll do as long as you don't need anything extra. 
(However my friend told me she found a tile in her dumpling once... and they tried to deny that it was theirs..? I don't know, man)

All in all, it was a solid cheap eats spot! I approve."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a quick dinner meal and I was not disappointed

We ordered the shanghai dumplings (chicken), shanghai dumplings (various meats), braised beef noodle soup, onion pancake roll & sliced beef.  The food was good and the wait time was short.  I was in a rush to get back to work so I really appreciated the quick service.  

If you ever do come here I highly recommend the oninon pancake roll & sliced beef."}
{"text":"Yummy vegetarian dumplings.
We also ordered green onion pancakes which had the right amount of crispiness.
The curry noodle dish was outstanding. 
The mapo-tofu spicy & soft.
The red bean pancake for dessert which we ordered with trepidation turned out to be delicious as well.
One waitress was nice but the other one had a continual frown & behaved as if she was doing us a favor when we ordered something! 
Don't need to go to Chinatown Toronto if you live in the suburbs of Markham or Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Really quite good as far as evening dim sum goes. Never had lamb in this fashion but my party found it tasty. Their technique could use some work as many of their offerings were waterlogged. The service could also be a little quicker and pleasent. Overall I plan to return and would suggest the place."}
{"text":"I felt like having some xiao long bao so I looked it up on yelp and quickly found this place! We ordered quite a lot for just two people *oink*

Xiao Long Bao $5.99 for 6
--------------------------
The skin at the top seems thick at the first look but it is actually very 'springy' and not too hard or soggy at all. The best way you can make the skin I would say. Have to eat it while is hot if not the skin will start to get try

Please be careful eating this as you could easily burn your tongue from the soup squirting out. The way I eat it- put the dumpling on your spoon, bite the top first, drink a bit of the soup first, then eat the rest

I read that there seem to be mixed reviews on yelp for this dish so I am going there again soon to see if their food quality is stable!

Pork&Leek Pan Fried Dumplings $5.99 for 5
------------------------------------------
Must order when you come here!
Bottom is crispy, skin is thin and the filling is juicy. Really enjoyed eating this

Salted Sticky Rice
------------------
Stuffing: dried shredded pork, deep fried donut stick & salted mustard

The sticky rice is soft and i like the ratio between the rice and the stuffing (some places give you mostly rice and not much stuffing inside)

The donut stick is still crispy and not over-fried when I ate it so I know everything was freshly prepared 
This would be a very nice quick breakfast if I live close by

Drunken Chicken
----------------
Fiancé have never tried this before so I decided to order it to see if he likes it. This is a cold dish and the chicken is being cooked first and then soak in the Chinese Wine at least overnight. It was pretty flavourful and the chicken was not dry. Pretty addictive dish i would say haha

Hot & Sour Soup (Small)
------------------------
It was a bit too spicy for me. I did not find that they had a good balance of sourness and spiciness

Minus one star because the table and seats were not clean"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch. This restuarant is quite small and can get crowded and heated quite quickly. I ordered a fried pork chop stir fry noodle ($7.50), green onion pancake
($3.50), and steamed beef and radish dumpling ($5.29). The steamed dumpling came in a order of 10. The skin was quite thin and fillings were quite tasty with amazing soup squirting out of the dumpling. The dumpling size is on the smaller end of the spectrum. The stir fry noodle was chewy and the pork chop was flavourful. I was really thankful they used lean meat and there weren't fat attached to it. The green onion pancake is good but alot smaller then chinese dumpling house. The portion sizes are alittle bit smaller but taste is good and prices are cheap. They have lunch specials from 11-3. Their spicy chili sauce goes well with the noodle and dumpling."}
{"text":"Its located within the Time Square Plaza. Please be sure to bring a Chinese (Cantonese Speaking) friend when coming here. English is not happening here. Show them pictures also helps. The service was good as i had a Chinese speaking friend who ordered everything. The food came out fast and piping hot good for dim sum. The place is very small like 25-30 people seating area. The main stuff we ordered is on the Dim Sum Menu. The pancake with Pork was delicious  about $6 and the steam (12 pcs) dumplings were good too. Pan Fried Dumplings were good but very oily. The noodles with Beef also good. They take CASH ONLY. Be sure to bring enough and tip your waiting staff. Overall had a good meal here. Would come again!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough freshly made dumplings in my life.  This place was recommended by a fellow food lover and i trust his taste.

Obviously the dumplings are good but you need to order the general tao chicken aka crack.

Check this place out."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. We go regularly to Northern Dumpling and it always delights. It's small, crowded, brusque but pleasant, fast, and reasonably priced. Their fried dumplings are superb, their steamed leek and pork dumplings excellent, and their soup dumplings have the thinnest wrapping in the city. But the highlight is the flash-fried green beans; yesterday they were particularly wonderful. This is a terrific restaurant."}
{"text":"I grew up eating northern style dumplings and I get the same homey, thick skinned, plump and juicy dumplings here. As always with northern dim sums, dishes tend to be on the oilier side but it's nostalgic for me so I don't mind.

The atmosphere is kinda noisy/cramped but it's kinda to be expected."}
{"text":"My experience at this restaurant was pretty mediocre. Most of the dishes seemed to be hit or miss for the most part. I really liked the onion pancake roll and sliced beef. The pancake was soft and slightly crunchy on the outside while the beef inside was bursting with flavor. Whatever sauce they decided to use for this was a great choice. I also really enjoyed the pork with garlic sauce. The meat was sliced pretty thin, and the pork had just the right amount of fat. The sauce was excellent, but I wish they gave a little bit more of it. The pan fried dumplings were pretty good. They were a little bit too oily for my taste, but I didn't mind eating them. The cucumbers with garlic were a huge letdown. The flavor was inconsistent within the dish itself.. The cucumbers at the bottom of the dish had a decent garlic-y flavor, but the rest (and majority) of the cucumbers were very bland and flavorless. It was a chore to finish the entire plate, and I really regretted even ordering it. The beef noodle soup could've been much better. I wasn't a fan of the broth, and I couldn't help but feel like the broth was missing a key ingredient or something. The noodles and beef used were about average. The minced meat noodle dish we ordered was very forgettable. I found the sauce they used to be plain and boring. I ended up adding a lot of hot sauce to it because I just wasn't satisfied with the flavor.

Overall, the prices were good (though I felt really ripped off with the cucumbers). The service was fine. I'm not sure if I would come back to this restaurant based on this experience alone, but part of me does feel like I would've really liked this place if we ordered different things. If I do eventually come back, I will probably order the soup dumplings and completely different noodle dishes. 2.5/5"}
{"text":"Ok this place was delicious!!!! Like legitimately was not expecting it to be good but it really was. 

We also ordered noodles which were a tad on the greasy side hence the 1 star docking but other wise we order dumplings upon dumplings and they were great! 

Now I will give them another try and update my review based on a more generalized tasting of more of their menu so stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Went there at 3pm. The restaurant wasn't busy. The food came very quickly.  We order pork, beef, lamb dumplings, onion fried pancakes... All was very delicious, very juicy and fresh. Big portions and very cheap.
Stuff was ok. Not too friendly. And restaurant was dirty. Floors and tables need a wash."}
{"text":"one of the more authentic dumpling houses - don't come here and expect service, it's very much a sit down, order, eat and go kind of establishment. their dumplings are great and will. satisfy your cravings! of course, get the xiao long baos and i always get the pan fried pork dumplings with chives, that alone is plenty to keep me stuffed for the day. prices are very affordable. they are slow sometimes, so a reminder may be needed if you find that some of your dumps are taking longer than others."}
{"text":"Originally we wanted to try Koi Ramen but it was closed for CNY so we ended up coming here. And it was a disappointment for me, I'm sorry. 

Rated at 4* by quite a few ppl gave me high expectations probably. So I had a very different view from the rest of the reviews here. 

We were all quite hungry, 3 of us,  we ordered steam dumplings, bean curd stir fry, fried chicken with spicy salt, fish with green beans, spicy beef noodles..the bill ended up to be $70+tip which is quite a bit considering only 3 of us. 

Our fried chicken came out bloody, they took it back and said will make a new one. Yes I know, it's a Chinese place and 99% of them don't do that. They re-fry the bloody one and send it back out but come on, at least make a quarter of an effort looking like you did. My friend had one bite from a piece and it was on the \"new\" plate... eww...minus 3 stars please... 

The yeah(s):

- prompt service (not all evening, part of the evening)
- price? 
-
-

The nah(s):

- Food was overly salty 
- not visually appetizing 
- our fried chicken came out with blood  they said they will make us a new one, but they didn't
- all servers only spoke mandarin...
- .we ordered the fish but it's basa fillet from frozen, how could it still taste fishy?

All in all, not a place I'm interested in coming back, at least for the next little while..."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place stayed under our radar all of this time. Our usual dumpling joints has gone down in quality over time and thus one day we were looking for a replacement and somehow came across this joint.

The dumplings here are delicious, I love their xiao long bao, or soup dumplings. Prepared fresh, these are to die for and a must order or two for me whenever we have been here, more and more recently!

The jellyfish, seasoned perfectly with the right amount of vinegar and cucumbers to garnish. Most places uses too much vinegar, overpowering the natural taste of the jellyfish, however, not here. They do it just right!

The regular dumplings are nice, fluffy and steaming hot. I love the leek and pork dumplings, and can more than eat a whole tray to myself!   

The restaurant is a little small compared to most Chinese restaurants, however, it makes it easier for the staff to manage the patrons and we've always had great service whenever I have dined here.  This is THE go to place for myself and friends now for dumplings in Richmond Hill/Markham.   

I look forward to trying their cumin lamb and the deep fried dumplings next time, I've seen it ordered by other patrons and they too look deliciously good! (The dumplings and lamb, not the other patrons! LoL!)

Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"This has got to be the hidden gem discovery of the year for me.

Food here is delicious and pretty inexpensive! I don't know how they manage to offer GOOD food, CHEAP prices, and FAST operation. Typically, you can only get 2 out of the 3 at any place.

We especially enjoyed their minced meat noodle, though every item we ordered was fantastic. We can't wait to try more and more dishes here. Check out my pics. They're all delicious if you want to try them.

This resto is in the Times Square plaza, so there are a fair number of parking spaces as well as underground parking.

I highly recommend this place. 

They're Cash only!"}
{"text":"This places takes RESERVATIONS!!!! Seriously.
I was looking for some good XLB and didn't want to go to 3,6,9 or A La Kitchen or Ding Tai Fung...so all you amazing yelpers steered me here! Why have I not been here before????

This place is your typical Asian hole in the wall with great XLB... the only thing I wish was there was more than one standard type of filling - pork. The pork is a mouthful, and the skin a tag thicker, but nothing I should be complaining about.

Got some Dan Dan noodles, Pork Wraps, spicy wontons (remember to mix in the peanut sauce)... and huge chicken dumplings.. they were the size of 2 in 1 - juicy, filling, and lightly pan fried to give it a bit of crisp.

For 5 dishes... it came to a bill total of $30... and tonnes of leftovers.

Done and Done.."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: typical Chinese, pretty pack during lunch hours, located at time square

Food: 
Beef brisket noodles: I didn't particularly like the noodle used, and found the beef to be quite tough 

Overall: won't be back, there's much better restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"Had the Lamb dumplings and the Pork and chive dumplings.  Definitely one of the better dumplings places around.  Both dumplings were filled well, they don't skimp on the meat.   The skin had a great chewy texture that's rarely achieved in Canada.  

Very few places do lamb dumplings right, and this is one of them."}
{"text":"The pork with garlic is baller. One of those dishes with the right combo of sweet salty and sour. The right combo of meat, fat and tendon to make each bite interesting. 

The beef roll was also great but a little on the top oil side. The dan dan mien was terrible  and watery but it might be a version I am not used to. The Xiao long bao were tasty in a rustic home made way. The restaurant is very small and it's best to come before the dinner rush."}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical to eat dumplings 'cause I imagine it to taste like frozen dumplings I can make at home (similar to how I thought ramen = instant noodles for the longest time, but I digress..) but this place is good! Dumplings in all forms - steamed, boiled, pan fried, soup-filled, wonton style. And not just dumplings either - tons of other Northern Chinese dim sum, noodles, meat & veggie dishes, and dessert. 

Xiao Long Bao - It's quite different from what you get at a Shanghai place. Tastes more meaty and the skin for their dumplings is definitely different here - I really like it. 

Fennel & Pork Dumpling - fennel tastes like dill!! Very strong & interesting taste for dumpling (can't decide if I'm a fan but they're really addictive..)

Wonton in Chili Oil - again, something unique about this here is that it has peanut butter at the bottom, but I kind of prefer it without

Potato Shreds - nice simple side dish, good with a dash of hot sauce

Drunken Chicken - ok 

I also like that this place has the black vinegar where most other restaurants only have the red one. 

*Cash Only*"}
{"text":"This is one of the most authentic dumpling place in GTA. I grew up in Northern part of China and this place tastes just like home!"}
{"text":"fave in the area, steamed lamb dumplings are a must every time i come here, the pancake roll with beef is great to, my family likes their red bean bun thingy!"}
{"text":"This is another place I recently read about. We came here specifically to try the Onion Pancake and Smoked Sliced Pork dish we saw mentioned in the article. We were not disappointed! We also tried the Pan Fried Pork Dumplings and the Onion Pancake Roll with Sliced Beef. All the dishes were very tasty and the portions very generous. And cheap! Each dish was only $5.25! I can imagine paying double that at other places.

My rating would have been higher if the decor and ambiance had matched the food and prices."}
{"text":"Dropped by here for lunch the other day. The soup filled dumpings and lamb dumplings were very tasty, I like how the dumpling skin is very thing. Good value as well, 12 lamb dumplings for $5"}
{"text":"The food was very typical northern Chinese food. Wouldn't come here for the atmosphere or if you wanted to try something extremely different. But would recommend coming here for the dumplings if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to echo some of my other fellow yelpers' opinions. The food was okay - we had the lamb dumplings, the potstickers, the garlic pork slices, some veggies and the lamb fried noodles. Greasy, but acceptable and not bad for the price.

But here's the kicker - I have to agree with others that the service is downright terrible. Look, I get it, it's a Chinese place, and we need to go in with a certain expectation of not being treated like royalty. But we were almost made to feel that the people working there went out of their way to make us feel unwanted. Firstly, the cap to the teapot was not capped on properly - when I poured the tea, the cap fell out and hot water poured into my hands. Instead of asking if I was okay, the lady yelled at me for not holding onto the lid while I was pouring. Come on. Then, she threw some napkins down for my to clean it up myself. Next, whenever we needed anything, people disappeared and were super reluctant to help us with other things we needed, like even an extra saucer for the vinegar.

People, we can do better than this."}
{"text":"This is a nice inexpensive Dumpling place. In addition to their excellent dumplings, they also make very nice green onion pancakes and noodles and fried rice. Each item on the menu is around 4-6 dollars so it's easy to eat out at 10 dollars a person. One warning - English literacy is close to zero. If you are vegetarian, be explicit. We ordered Shanghai noodles and said we were vegetarian and said no eggs z- it promptly came with no eggs but with shrimp. They did correct it for us but don't assume anything as we did that no eggs and veg means no shrimp too."}
{"text":"the Northern chinese food here is EXCELLENT!  I been to many in Scarborough Kennedy steels and nothing is as good as Norther DUmpling Kitchen! IT's well worth the visit. For non Mandarin speaking customers, NP they have many customers from western, filipino south asian and Asian! They are sooo good that everyone comes here."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to get soup dumplings. They've increased prices since I first went a few years ago, but the food is still the same great quality. The soup dumplings explode in your mouth and the broth is greatly balanced with the meat. We always order the cabbage and pork steamed dumplings as well."}
{"text":"A great little place for lunch. Very authentic Northern Chinese cooking. Didn't order their signature soup dumpling. But the three dishes that we order for lunch was delicious. My favorite was the sautéed string beans. Shredded pork and veggie and Ma Poa Tofu was equally good. Food is good enough to overlook the place not being tidy and service not being the best.
Will definitely want to come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This place was brought to my attention from the TV show \"Lets Eat.\"
I have been on a Shanghai dim sum feastathon as of late and this one is similar to the rest of them in terms of the food.

Came on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. At first glance you can tell this place has been around for a while. Everything looks old and run down. Then menu that was presented to us was in English and Chinese so that was a pleasant surprise since all of the other Shanghai dim sum places I have went to only gave a Chinese menu and you had to ask for an English menu. 

All the food was great. I find the the xiao long bao ($5.99 for 6) we ate here was a little different from the others I have tried. The outer layer was a bit more tough and the meat portion inside was a bit more filled with meat and less soup. Either way it still tasted good.

What I really enjoyed the most here though were the pancake beef wraps. The wrap was nice crispy but it was also soft at the same time. Great flavours in the beef meat made it a perfect dish.

We also had fried thick noodle with beef and shrimps or if you read it on the menu its called Shanghai fried noodles. I think this dish was around $7.49 - It was a bit small in terms of size but still large enough to share with others. They gave us the smalliest pieces of beef and shrimps and very little of it as well. The dish still tasted good though.

Overall, just as good as the other Shanghai dim sum places around with just a few minor setbacks.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"food was good, but the waiter (young tall Chinese guy) is super rude, threw the menu on our tables and opened the steam from the dumplings in our faces, attitude was horrible and he didn't only do this to our table, I noticed his behaviour was like this from the start. horrible service that made good food unenjoyable."}
{"text":"Gave two stars cos service is fast and friendly. But found hair in my food twice ! Two different visits and the bathrooms are a disgrace. Not going back."}
{"text":"Good place for northern Chinese food, including beef pancake roll, dumplings, and beef noodle soup. It's not the best I've had, but I'd definitely come back here when I'm in the area. The food was flavourful, and very affordable. The place is quite cramped though at times because it's small, but when we went at lunch time on a weekend, we didn't have to wait. I think people tend to eat quickly and then leave. It's not really a place to sit and chat for a long time. The only dish I didn't really enjoy and thought it was not worth it was the sliced pork belly with onion pancake. The pork belly pieces were so tiny."}
{"text":"The food used to be good here but not anymore. The steamed pork and leek dumplings were flavourless. The salty sticky rice was also flavourless. The panfried beef dumplings we had were drenched in gutter oil... it was just not good. The XLB's also were a big miss this time around as it was also flavourless. The only decent thing here is the onion pancake and the beef roll wrap. Not sure if I would come back here again. I am pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here last week for the first time to satisfy a dan dan craving....oh, man! thei noodles are so good and chewy, perfectly spicy and peanut. the sauce that comes with their fried tofu is outrages as well as the scallion pancakes. I'm not sure they make the dumplings in house, but i tried both the xiao long bao and the vegetarian ones, both steamed, and they were both delicious. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My go to for Shanghai food! I find their food less oily compared to other Shanghai food restaurants. It's perfect for a casual night. They have been around for quite some time. My favourites are their soup filled dumplings (xiao lung bao), the double cooked pork (which is also on the lunch menu Monday - Friday), and the stewed pickled cabbage and pork. Prices are very reasonable. Large selection of food. Come with more people if you want to try more items off their menu."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent customer of this restaurant for a while but have been disappointed as quality has declined over time. However, if you want some cheap homemade Shanghai food, this place isn't a bad choice. They offer a variety of menu choices and food comes quickly. My personal favourites are the Dan Dan noodles and the pork and chives steamed dumplings. Note: Servers here do not really speak English but the last time I went we just had to write our menu item #'s on paper to order."}
{"text":"Not a noisy or rundown  dumpling place at all.  Place is clean. Service is friendly and efficient.  He  Xiao long bag (siu lung bao) have extra thin dough,  which is very hard to make!!!  Their dumplings are  above average for the stuffing. Their fried egg white with  fish and  prawn is  very smooth, rich and filled with seafood. Their fried egg white with red bean filling is very  fluffy and  soft.  The server actually  came out to make sure the two of us had ordered the 8-piece version and not the 4-piece version.  Hubby decided to go big cos of the minimal price difference.  Reasonable price.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Northern Dumpling Kitchen is easily my favourite place for dumplings in the city.  I have recommended many friends to this place and they've yet to disappoint anyone.

Pros:
Very good dumplings
Prices are excellent

Cons:
Not too many seats

Growing up on dumplings as a child, I'm very picky about dumplings.  Having tried all sorts of places around the city, Northern Dumpling is easily my favourite.  This review will focus only on the dim sum part of the menu.  I have not tried anything else here because that's all you need to order when you come here!

Northern dumpling has about 15-20 different types of dumplings to choose from.  Let me tell you this, they're all very good.  My favourties are definitely the pork and fennel, pork and mushroom and soup filled dumplings.  Northern Dumpling seems to be one of the few places that uses fennel when it says fennel.  A lot of places seem to use dill hoping you will not know the difference.  You'll also notice right away the prices are excellent.  10 dumplings for $4-5??  Amazing.  You will rarely find value like this in the city 

Service is on par with many places.  There usually are 2 servers working at all times.  When it gets busy, it can get a little hectic for them.  They try real hard though to make sure everyone is content.  I can see some people will get irked by the wait, but it's not the servers fault there's only two of them.

Northern Dumpling is not a very big place.  There are about 6 tables and 6 booths if I remember correctly.  The place can fill out fast during certain parts of the day.  When it's full, it can be cramped, but nothing crazy.  

If you're looking for dumplings, give this place a try.  This place will teach you what a dumpling is really supposed to taste like.  I guarantee it!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch on a Sunday. Enjoyed the no frills service and food. The place is small but very comfortable. Our waiter came really quickly and each of the for orders came really quick. 

My favourite is the beef pancake. It's salty and with lots of sauce, just like how a beef pancake should be! 

The soup dumpling xiao long bao is awesome. In some places, there is no soup when I bite into my soup dumpling. But this xiao long bao has very thin dough skin and lots of soup inside!

The leek pancake was lukewarm when served, but our waiter agreed to heat in microwave for us. Thank you!

If you are ever looking for quick and filling lunch in the area, I would recommend here!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place a few times now and I can give a pretty accurate review.  Not sure why this gets good reviews but it's mediocre at best. 

The food is not bad but I can easily find better in the Markham area. So the dumplings, noodles, pancakes we're pretty good. They should be right? That's their namesake. But if you order something other than that your taking a risk.  We got a vegetable tofu stir fry. The tofu was fresh but the vegetables were old and mushy.  We waited so long for the food we ate it anyway.  As for the service.  The kitchen likes to make one dish for each table at a time. So everybody gets to eat right? But then nobody gets all of their food at the same time. So everybody waits.  Then when everybody finally gets all their food they all leave at the same time and it starts all over again.  The restaurant needs to manage the cycles better."}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp reviews and sadly I think I have different a view from the majority.

Service:
- prompt and typical of Asian places
- accommodated us when I called in advance to ensure a table (there were 6 of us)

Food:
- portions are small
- beef onion pancake and soup dumplings weren't great... I've definitely had better.  Beef was rather bland, and the dumpling skin was thin and wasn't as \"springy\"
- red bean meringue puffs were fairly good though the meringue was a bit heavy... not sure what they added to it
- hot and sour soup was decent
- their non-spicy version of szechuan green beans were really good

Glad I tried it but will probably continue my search for alternatives to Din Tai Fung."}
{"text":"A medium-sized shop in a large plaza, Northern Dumpling Kitchen offers  a full stomach at a modest price. Their other dishes are fine and aren't anything special, but their dumplings are incredible and come in many different varieties. Service is a touch slow, with only one person waiting the floor of the shop. If you're planning to stop by for dinner, come a bit earlier; the restaurant usually fills up between 6-6:30pm."}
{"text":"A hidden gem - but bring cash - this mom and pop feeling dumpling house was awesome, but doesn't have an interac machine.  There is a TD bank in the same mall so it isn't a big deal.  We went nuts on soup dumplings, green beans and general tsaos chicken - the service was super fast - we got there at 4:20, had 6 dishes made to order, ate, had enough leftovers for another meal boxed up, paid, and were back in the car by 5.  Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant for dumplings and obviously other northern Chinese cuisine i.e. more wheat-oriented items. I had not been here in several years and the food was as reliable and tasty as I rememberd it.
The leek dumplings were ordinary, not bad, but nothing outstanding. The pig intestines and pepper was very well done. The onion pancakes were above average and 'meaty.' The xiaolongbao was quite good and in fact different from everyone else's. There was a certain spice to it (like a more complex cinnamon) that nowhere else had used that I had tasted. It worked. When I asked the waiter if he knew what the spice was his response was 'I don't cook the food.' When I asked him if he would ask the cooks he shrugged and in fact never came back! 
All in all, the food was good to above average. The prices are inexpensive and the four items came to $30. The tea was workmanlike and free of course.
Belatedly and on the way out I noticed a plaque that proclaims the restaurant having won a Chinese restaurant ward in 013 for its Garlic Pork dish. That is something to consider.
I had to deduct a star for the waiter's indifference and then subsequently when we wanted to pay he was busy for many minutes playing on a customer's phone. Also, the soya sauce dispenser had vinegar in it and although they had labelled it as vinegar on top in small print I had just paid attention to the bottle's own label and misused it.
I feel Northern Dumpling is a nice alternative, but caught between the massive menu and cheap prices of Richmond Court and the higher end food, prices and atmosphere of Jody on the other side."}
{"text":"My fiance, his brother, his friend and I decided to meet up at Time Square Mall Center for lunch. We weren't craving anything specific and after walking by this restaurant on the way to the mall front and saw lots of Chinese families in there, we decided might as well get some soup dumplings! 

We were seated by the window and were given a paper to write down our order. The service wasn't the greatest. It took them a long time just to give us the menu. But we were just busy chatting away and catching up anyways so it didn't really bother us. Onto ordering! -  We often get soup dumplings from Joe's Shanghai in the city so we wanted to see how this place matches up. We ended up ordering 2 orders of soup dumplings, 1 order of shrimp/egg/chive dumplings, Shanghai stir fry noodle, soy whole fish, and garlic minced meat string beans. The string beans was out within 5 mins. I was a little worried at first since I requested less spicy for my fiance. Since it only took them 5 mins to bring this out, I thought perhaps it was pre-made or was made extra for another table. Surprisingly it wasn't too spicy,  it was oily but quite tasty! The noodle was next. It wasn't the same Shanghainese noodle we were expecting. It was more of the lo mein noodle and under seasoned. There were just a few pieces of meat/shrimp and not enough veggies. The soup dumplings came shortly after. These soup dumplings were as good as the ones from Joe's Shanghai - maybe even better! The skin was perfectly made, the soup was clear/not fatty at all.  I poured dark vinegar and ginger all over mine. Each of them stayed intacted and filled with piping hot soup. The dumplings were the let down of the meal however. My fiance bit into one and asked.. \"there's shrimp? where?\" The chives were a little overwhelming and the skin was too chewy. I ended up tearing open all the dumplings and just ate the fillings. The fish was the last to arrive. It wasn't anything we were expecting. Not quite sure if in fact we got the right order lol. We were expecting steamed fish with soy sauce + ginger + scallion? But we got this deep fried fish soaked in garlic sauce? Everyone really enjoyed this dish but i thought the sauce was a little too thick. I ended up dipping the fish into vinegar. 

Overall a satisfying lunch. The service could had been better - had to ask multiple times for water and napkins - they gave us 3 napkins for 4 ppl? $65 dollars including tax and tip. Not bad for a 4 people weekend lunch!"}
{"text":"I LOVE DUMPLINGS.

I went here late last night and I am a fan of the dumplings. I got the pan fried leek and pork dumplings. It was $4.99 for 5 pan fried dumplings but it was amazing! The skin of the dumpling was good and you can taste that it was made in the store and not frozen and store bought.  

Also got the Onion Beef Pancake Roll which was decent. I am more of a fan of Asian Legend's version more!

I would come back here for the dumplings. Chinese food always has a place in my heart.

P.S. Am I the only one who dips my dumplings in soya sauce? I was introduced to vinegar and it changed my dumpling game. Take a bite and keep a spoon underneath the dumpling. Pour a bit of vinegar in the dumpling and let it flow through. Take a bite and place all the goodness from your spoon into the dumpling again and be fast enough to catch the liquids again with the spoon! And just repeat! 

Trust me. It's so good!"}
{"text":"This will probably be one of my shorter reviews, but this place was cheap 'n cheerful!  

When I go to places that serve dim sum and dumplings, I'm always skeptical that they'll try to plate up something from the frozen aisle of T&T.  If that's what I want, I'll pop open my freezer and reheat that crap in the comforts of my own home.  However, what Northern Dumpling Kitchen offers is not steamed-from-frozen dumplings, but rather homemade - skin 'n innards - dumplings at affordable prices.  The majority of the dumplings were $4.99/10.

The Shrimp/Chives/Egg was really good if you don't feel like anything too heavy.  I also ordered the Sliced Beef Brisket wrapped in Chinese Pancake and although it was good, I found it a bit greasy.  Everything came to the table in a timely manner.

So if you're stopping by here, I'd suggest you stick to the dumplings UNLESS you have someone who reads Chinese in your party.  Perhaps they can order something else that's traditionally Northern!

What was sorta bummer was that the only 2 pan-fried dumplings were BOTH of the pork-variety.  You may be able to ask for the steamed ones to be pan-fried, but I didn't bother.

Very casual, divey atmosphere.  Nothing fancy!"}
{"text":"This place was great! 
Quite an extensive selection of food, and not limited to only dumplings! 
Everything we ordered was tasty. The beef pancake roll and the soup dumplings were my two favourite items on the menu. 
The pricing was also amazing. We ordered so much food between the two of us, and it only came to $20 each. 
I'll definitely be returning !"}
{"text":"I came here for an early Sunday dinner and the place was crowded  so with the positive yelp reviews I figured it would be a good bet. 

No frills Chinese dumplings -- not the best I've had but not the worst either. We tried the onion pancake with beef and agree with others -- tasty but greasy. Have it as soon as it hits the table as it will taste extra greasy in a few more minutes.  

Braised beef noodles were also ok. Beef was decent quality and it had just the right amount of spice. 

We ordered pea shoots but they had big leaves -- a sure sign that they were left \"on the vine\" for too long. Age makes them less sweet and tender. 

The pork meatballs (lion heads) were terrible. It didn't come in a hotpot and the sauce was way too starchy and congealed as it cooled. I've had much much better in many different places. 

Service was quick but food was mediocre. Not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"We love this place. Go for the soup dumplings, stay for the braised beef noodle soup and the beef pancake roll.

The steamed dumplings aren't anything too special but everything has a nice homemade feel to it. 

Cash only. Expect to pay about $30 for a fulsome meal for two."}
{"text":"One of these stars is exclusively for value,  food was good, the shrimp leek steamed dumpling was great, while the fried beef and chicken dumplings were as expected - one has got to try really hard to mess up fried foods .  Next we will try the pancakes and noodles as those seem to be the other popular dishes. Busy at 6pm, we were glad to be there at 5:30pm on a Saturday.  Service was good and fast, as we were out of there by 6:30pm.  Menu is available in English.  Good for groups as they put tables together.  Located outside the Times Square mall on highway 7, and I mention this as it took us 15mins to find the place, park the car within the complex.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The food is okay but the food portions are smaller than you expect.  For 2 people we had to order 6 items to be full.  Cost about $20 per person.  You would think dumplings and noodles would be cheaper than that.  Surprisingly small considering most items are made mainly of dough."}
{"text":"Cash only.

I got to know the owner of Northern Dumpling Kitchen through work recently and decided to pay them a visit for lunch with my girlfriend (I had a huge craving for dumplings today lol.)

They have a nice variety of dumpling fillings to choose from and you can have them steamed, boiled or pan-fried. The menu also features a lot of authentic Northern Asian styled and Shanghainese items... noodles are usually a staple in this type of cuisine.

My friend and I ordered a few items to share, but first things first, we both ordered a cold glass of soybean milk right when we sat down lol... somehow it was a no-brainer us lol. It quenches thirst and also helps cool you down if you're having spicy food! On the other hand, if you order the HOT soybean milk... WARNING: It is not what you think it is lol. It comes in a big bowl with added ingredients in it lol. If you feel adventurous, I say go for it ;)

The Leek & Pork is one of the classic dumpling fillings. The dumplings were tender and delicious. The Shanghainese fried noodles was not as oily and up to the standard *thumbs up*. The sticky rice roll (order the salty one!) seemed simpler compared to those restaurants where they jam pack it with all the ingredients. I enjoyed this lighter version... at least I can eat more! The red bean pancake was on the house (Thank you!); it was very light and I enjoyed it very much :)

Overall, food service was fast - great place to grab a quick lunch. Service was also fast and courteous. I'd come back again to try more items!

P.S. There are plenty of parking underground. Entrances on both North side and West side of Times Square."}
{"text":"Dumplings are one of my favorite aspects of Chinese cuisine and this place definitely delivers. This is a wonderful alternative to more expensive Northern Chinese restaurants like Asian Legend. The dumplings are amazing and offer great value. It's a no-nonsense type of establishment that offers up a very traditional menu of favorites. Keep it mind this place is cash only."}
{"text":"It was not good. We went on a Friday night at 6:30pm and it was not full. This should have been the first indication to \"leave now, its not what you think\", but we decided to give it a try. We ordered fried dumplings, a ga geng noodles, and xlbs. The soup in the xlbs tasted very different and gave off a bit more of a beef aroma? Maybe I wasn't used to it, but for all the places I have tried xlbs, this did not taste very fresh. The fillings in the dumplings were average at best and the best dish of the night was the ga geng noodles. Even that dish was average. The sauce was overpowering with garlic and noodles were a bit too soft. 

Overall, we were disappointed with the restaurant. This restaurant was not bad, but also not very good."}
{"text":"Not sure how this restaurant received good reviews. It was all awful! Dumplings were not flavourful. The skin was hard. Dandan noodles were soupy vs a spicy meat sauce. Veggies were definitely not fresh. Greasy as the others had said. I would stay away."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like soup dumplings? But beware, you'll get burned if you're not careful! 

They take reservations. Service is fast. Food is amazing and in line with comfort food. Deeeelicious."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
This place is located on Highway 7 and Leslie St at Times Square Richmond Hill. There were lots of parking spots at the plaza. 

[SERVICE] - 1/5
Not enough servers on a Friday night. Hostess did not even acknowledge us when we walked in. I noticed that somebody from the kitchen had to come out to help out. We had to flag down a server for tea and napkins, and the washroom was out of order. I felt really bad for the staff on that night because it was a disaster. 

[DÉCOR] - 2/5 
This restaurant was quite large, but still fully packed. Chairs were comfy, but the tables were dirty. The server did not wipe our table before she placed down our menus. 

[QUALITY] - 3/5
The pork in the dumplings was quite tender, and the dumpling wrapper was pretty high-quality and cooked perfectly. The other ingredients were just average. 

[ORDER] - 3/5
- Pork & Chive Dumplings - $4.99: really good! Meat was juicy and tasted like homemade dumplings, but I'm not 100% sure if they were actually homemade. 

- Minced Meat with Noodle in Peking Sauce $5.50: the sauce had too much garlic, and not enough of any other flavours. The noodles were okay, but just slightly overcooked. 

- Onion Pancake Roll & Sliced Beef - $5.29: flavourful and delicious, but quite small. I thought it would be bigger because of the pics on Yelp! 

[OVERALL] - 3/5
The dumplings were the best items at this place, and I would definitely recommend them! However, I wouldn't recommend anything else because the quality was average, and the portions were quite small."}
{"text":"An authentic Rhill gem! 

Whenever you do pay a visit to this little place in that packed plaza not only is finding parking an issue; the place is usually packed.

On occasion; they have younger working staff that can help with any language barriers but regardless the food is STELLAR and more than affordable! 

The soup dumplings are oh so good! and you have to use the Chili sauce, soya sauce and vinegar combo... to die for! Too good to pass up!"}
{"text":"The soup dumplings are good enough here, a bit underfilled. My biggest problem is how dirty and grungy it is - one of the most dirty restaurants I've been to. I can't believe people still come in and it functions in a plaza up here. I cannot with a clean conscience give this place more than 1 star, cleanliness is important. Dumplings are at 3 stars but general tao chicken was made from tiny scraps of chicken. Everything makes it obvious that they cut corners to keep it as cheap as possible so if it looks this dirty it must be much worse behind the scenes. They need to clean up this place. I've never been in a restaurant that I am scared to touch surfaces and then touch my food. I am afraid to drink the tea bc the cups are oily. Sorry won't return."}
{"text":"this place is not bad. after chinese dumpling house at midland and finch closed down, this is an acceptable replacement for me. 

the only issue i had was finding the pan fried dumplings that i like, which are just like the steamed ones, but just... pan fried.

the pan fried dumplings i did order, came with just 5 piecesand they were longer almost like japanese gyoza.

also ordered the 'xia long bao' which was quite good. comes with 6. 
had the green onion and beef pancake.

everything was pretty good, the only thing that i didn't like was the jelly fish. it tasted way different than what i'm accustomed to. wouldn't recommend it. but maybe that's what it's supposed to taste like to their people and im just ignorant

will come back to try and get myself some pan fried dumplings."}
{"text":"This is a authentic Asian dumpling house. I been here a couple times but this time, I had a party of 10 for lunch. You can only imagine the  different variety of food. The dumpling here are good and the dishes here are good. It's a nice Asian dinner/lunch place. Nothing more nothing less."}
{"text":"My go-to dumpling house. It serves delicious soup-filled dumplings; not many other dumping houses in the area serves this and made in-house. 

Very homey feel restaurant."}
{"text":"Great dumpling at a reasonable price. Ideal for a quick bite. Simple interior nothing fancy."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to restaurant for dumplings.  When this place first opened the service was chaotic, but they've since turned it around.  It can get busy for dinner, and as it gets busy the food can take a little longer to come out, but nothing too bad.  Now to the food, they have an extensive menu so it can take a while to try everything. 
 
- Dumplings: Delicious, they are plump, juicy and freshly made.  
- The cold/salad dishes are authentic and very good.  
- The beef noodle soup is very flavourful, although nothing life changing.  
- The stir fried lamb was a little over seasoned, but still tender.  Their other meat dishes were pretty good (like their deep fried pork dish).
- They have quite a few different steamed buns, and pancakes.  I've tried their green onion pancake and it was crispy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside.  
- The hot and sour soup was pretty standard, nothing too bad or good to talk about.

Overall, I would say this is one of the better northern chinese restaurants in the area, and worth a visit if you're looking for some good dumplings."}
{"text":"I love their dumplings!! Especially the pork and chives steamed dumplings! I think they make this dumplings 2nd best aside from Deng Tai Feng.

The price is really good too! a lot cheaper than Asian Legends and Deng Tai Feng..

The Pork and Chives Dumplings are $3.99 for 10! They are freshly made.. and the skin is so thin and soft. One bite and your mouth will be splashed with the great tasting soup! They are not oily or salty at all! 

The steamed twisted buns with condensed milk on the side are $2.50 for 2. Freshly made and steamed... really satisfied my carb needs!

The lunch specials mainly rice dishes.. startiing from $5.75 that comes with sweet and sour soup or soy bean drink.

Services are always  nice and friendly... A good place for me to practice my Mandarin! :)

Cash only!"}
{"text":"Good hand-made dumplings, tasty and juicy. The price for either lunch or  dinner is of good value.."}
{"text":"Yay! I like Northern Dumpling Kitchen.  A Lot.  I have been here a few times.  My favourite dishes are the jelly fish appetizer and the steamed leek and pork dumplings, but I have yet to find something that tastes less than good here.  When I do explore the rest of the menu, I find the tea duck very tasty and not too dry.  They also do the noodle dishes right.  They use the mid-width noodle instead of the thick northern noodle, so there are more sauce in each bite.  Last but not least, the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Had a mixed time. Would've had a better time eating brunch here due to its portion sizing. Too much for breakfast or lunch, too little for dinner. Some things were great, some things were  not. 

The Dan Dan noodles were good. Good portion. Good taste for a price under 7 dollars. 7/10

The steamed pork and leek dumplings were good for their price. Juicy. Good amount of filling and dumpling wrap is not overly thick. 7/10

Yeung chow fried rice was terrible. It was spam and egg fried rice with some shrimp. Seriously, what is this absurdity? Yeung chow fried rice is supposed to have at least charsiu or kailan. Nicer ones will have crab meat. For the price of 7.50 I didn't expect crab or kailan or even scallion. But using spam instead of a unprocessed protien is sad. I never heard of this dish EVER using spam. 3/10

Would have been at least three stars but the fried rice ruined it."}
{"text":"2/5

I am a sucker when it comes to lamb skewers, so when the hyped up Northern Dumpling Kitchen delivered me a platter of 6 skewers of which 2 were completely overdone and black, I was really upset. I requested for the staff to exchange the two overcooked skewers for two new skewers, but they denied to do so. Our plate looked so so sad compared to the fresh batch given the party sitting next to us :( 

Aside from the lamb skewers, we also ordered a variety of other dishes.

Lamb Noodle Soup - noodles were cooked nice, broth wasn't too salty, and the taste of lamb was definitely present. The meat chunks were overdone, and some parts were unfortunately super fatty. There aren't any vegetables that come with the noodles either.

Soup Dumplings - standard. Nothing that really blows me out of the water. Didn't taste great, but it didn't taste bad. Would not order again by virtue that there are simply a lot of better alternatives out there.

Steamed Chicken Dumplings - best thing we ordered. The soup interior was refreshing and flavour. The dumplings had the right balance of moisture - not too wet but not too sticky.

Pork Chive Dumplings - also very standard.

Juliened Potato Appetizer - this was pretty good too. Appropriate amount of dressing, and the potatoes were the right texture.

Five Color Appetizer - good portion size for the price. Came with lots of fresh vegetables, vermicelli noodles, and peanut dressing. If you are lacking leafy greens in your order, definitely go for this dish.

When it comes to Northern Chinese Cuisine, although Northern Dumpling Kitchen delivers on quality appetizers at a competitive price, I do not plan on coming back often."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Shanghai dumplings so decided to give this place a try. The soup dumplings (xiao long bao) were delicious as previous yelpers have mentioned. Be careful not to burn you tongue when biting into the XLB. We also got the beef rice noodles.
Overall, happy with the food quality. The only down side is that it may be hard to get parking here during dinner hours"}
{"text":"XLB is pretty good but there are better nearby options. One negative is they only take cash but not a huge deal."}
{"text":"Have a craving for dumplings? Well you can't go wrong with a place with \"dumpling\" in their name! 

Came here for lunch on a Sunday, and with a 4 star review, we were definitely expecting big tingz for this bad boy here. We ordered the steamed pork and mushroom dumplings which comes in 10 for 4.99, soup dumplings that come in 6 for 6.00, and pan fried beef dumplings with 5 for $5.50-6.00. Hands down, our favorite was the pan fried dumplings which of course had to be the lowest quantity. The biggest bang for your buck would definitely be the steamed dumplings which were pretty good. We really craved for the soup dumplings, and unfortunately it was our least favorite. It didn't come out piping hot like we were used to, and it was quite salty on the inside. Quite disappointed in that. We also ordered a noodle on the side which was a decent price of 6.99. Between the both of us for a nice meal, it was about $13 each. 

Service was very Chinese lol. Bring your meal and never come back. If you're of a different ethnicity, the menu is in English and are able to understand you, so no worries there. 

I think I'd like to visit other dumpling places first to see if this is the best. It's good, but still more to be desired. 3.5/5."}
{"text":"One of my favourite dumpling spots. My go to order are the lamb dumplings and the chives and pork dumplings"}
{"text":"Agree with the other two reviewers so far :) This place rocks! They have a long dim sum menu full of dumplings for around $5/plate (10pcs) but their other offerings are just as good too. 

Now, I have to warn you that if you're gonna order something with \"chili\" in the name, it just might seriously kill your tastebuds for the rest of the meal.  Order it, expecting that to happen. They use sichuan peppercorns... even eating one was enough to make the left side of my tongue go numb for a few minutes! That's in addition to using those small red chilis... If you've got a friend who brags about loving hot stuff, I'd suggest you get them to finish a bowl  of the szechuan fish soup :D 

We always order some dishes like the garlic pea shoots and the eggplant dish to balance it out.  Also, the first time I came here, I found the dishes tasty, but way too salty for my liking. This time, I asked for half salt and it was perfect."}
