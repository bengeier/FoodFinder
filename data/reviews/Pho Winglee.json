{"text":"Winglee is a big step up in quality compared to other Vietnamese places I have been to in the valley.  The calamari appetizer is awesome. Deliciously spiced, so fresh, so crispy, no fishy taste at all.  The pork patty roll is awesome. You get three in an order! Lots of other places put lots of rice noodles as filler but not here.  The owner/manager guy is super friendly too and makes you feel welcome. I will come back!"}
{"text":"Originally from Ca & came to visit my fam and was craving Pho. I'm a big foodie and besides everyone knows Pho is all about the broth. So after checking out the reviews, decided to try this place out and Yasss, the broth was layered with delicious flavors! Absolutely loved it!! A definite must try!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is new but very kind and organized. Food proportions are great! Owners are extremely kind. I had the Pho special and I have to say it's the best in the area. Both proportion and flavor.  (Long time Pho lover)"}
{"text":"I loved the broth, one of the best pho places in town. Great customer service, definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"It is a really good Vietnamese Restaurant, the Pho in here is little different than other restaurants. I recommend the Bun bo Hue, if you love spicy! It taste sooooo good and kind surprised me! This is the greatest Pho I ever had."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place. The food was all very good. The only things I would change would be having the fat cooked off a bit more and the iced coffee was a bit to strong for my taste. I will be back for sure!   I tried the bun with beef. Not sure what the meat was marinated in but it was super delicious"}
{"text":"We waited for 40 minutes for the food to get here and the chicken pho was bad, $9 for 5 pieces of chicken and some gross organs, not worth going."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef pho and shrimp spring roll. I particularly like the soup in beef pho which is flavorful. But the noodle is too thin and soft to me. It is my first time to try Vietnam spring roll, which is a bit chewy, but tastes good with the sauce."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch today because of the positive Yelp reviews.  We had shopped at the poultry shop before but didn't know they opened up a pho place right next to it.  The owner greeted us personally upon our arrival.  Very friendly waiting staff.    We ordered spring rolls as appetizer, the XL pho special, and shaking beef w/ rice for entrees.  The owner told us that they cook their soup broth for over 12 hrs, so we were really looking forward to eating our noodle soup.    The spring rolls came shortly after we ordered.  I don't know what they put in the peanut sauce, but it was so yummy!  We were fighting for the last piece LOL.  Then the XL pho special came, It was so big!  I quickly took a sip of the soup, so good!  A lot more flavorful than the average pho place.  There were a variety of meat in the soup, but I also saw a huge piece of ox tail.  One warning though, you have to have a huge appetite to finish this big bowl of noodle.  The shaking beef came on a sizzling hot plate, the aroma quickly filled the room.  It smell and tasted great.    All in all, everything tasted great, we'll definitely come back for more.  As my son puts it, this is our new favorite pho place now!"}
{"text":"Great place for a good sit down meal/takeout.  We came in on Sat afternoon to an empty restaurant and regardless of our urge to leave we decided to trust the yelp reviews and try the food. We ordered the fresh spring rolls, the shaking beef and the pho tai. The spring rolls were fuller than other places as another yelper mentioned and was flavorful due to the extra herbs, but we found the rice paper to be a bit too dry/firm. The shaking beef on the other hand was really tender and the slightly spicy dipping sauce really enhanced the dish. Lastly, the pho broth had nice clean flavors and was on the sweeter side, but I prefer that so it was definitely one of the better pho places I have tried.   Overall, I would give a 4 out of 5 for good sevice, food and good portions. I knocked 1 star bc I found the spring rolls to be a little dry and because our table was dirty. We always wipe down the table before we eat since we have a small child, but contrary to the look/feel, it was really dirty."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Very delicious pho, the rare steak is so lean and their pho soup broth has so much more flavor than other pho Ive tried. The workers are super nice and its nice to walk around the mini market after you eat. So many foreign treats its fun like a mini visit to another country."}
{"text":"This is as mom and pop - hole in the wall restaurant as it gets. Don't let the decor (or lack of)  deceive you. Food is super good, very easy on your wallet."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  Fantastic pho and the chicken wings are to die for, possibly the best I've ever had!  Friendly service and yummy food!  My favorite place for pho!"}
{"text":"Terrific place! Great food, service, and price..."}
{"text":"It's like my Vietnamese mom's home-cooking...but better. Sorry mom! Came here a couple of times and each time, I was not disappointed. I haven't tried everything off the menu, but so far I've ordered the Bun Bo Hue, Ca Kho, and Nem Nuong Cuon. The Nem Nuong wasn't that amazing, but a nice appetizer to start off the meal. However, the entrees were delicious. The bun bo hue is just the right amount of spicy and the BEST part? Pho Winglee does not skimp out on the meats!!! I ran out of noodles before I finished the meats which is rare to say at a Vietnamese restaurant. The Ca Kho is so flavorful, and is topped off with bacon bits...truly an authentic Vietnamese dish, pairs with white rice to balance out the strong flavor. They make their sugar cane drink fresh on their grocery side of the store, so if you have time to stop by...its across the street from Mekong Plaza!"}
{"text":"Pretty amazing place for beef or chicken Pho, bun, grilled meats etc. it has a certain level of amazing layers of flavors, quantity and just variety of menu. The chicken is great range and attached to the adjacent their market."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon the mini market a couple of weeks ago and bought some fresh and delicious mangos and jackfruit. I finally was able to try the restaurant. The pho was tasty and you can tell they used fresh ingredients. The menu may seem a little pricey but it's definitely worth it. The owner and staff were friendly as well! I'll definitely be back to try the bahn mi!"}
{"text":"My go-to pho in the valley. I recommend the bun bo hue, just to make sure they put pork blood in it. They don't put as much as noodles in bun bo hue though. Also the chicken wings are good. Coffee is a little bit strong. Final Tip: Make sure you call them before actually go."}
{"text":"I guess this is the place where the chickens are great. My parents buy chickens at this place in bulk and the price is reasonable. I am not quite sure what \"cheap\" or \"better deal\" is in the Asian language. :D   The also have very yummy \"Ngoc Mia\" or fresh squeeze sugar cane juice. YUMMY. It is worth it for the amount they give you (half juice, the rest ice) but I guess every place is like this. Haha. Best way is to let the ice melt and you have more to drink. :D  This place is like a mini super market with fresh jackfruit (which my mom buys because the whole jack fruit is too much to eat so she buy the hand peeled and packaged ones). They also sell little water ceramic things; it was kinda cool. It is a very asian-y place. :D"}
{"text":"Horrible. I'd come here to buy fruit, sugarcane juice, and maybe chicken from the store. Aside from that, I'll probably never step foot into their restaurant again.   Service and food were horrid. Mind you, this was at 12pm on a saturday, and there was only one other table here besides us.  I counted over 10 different times where we had to remind them to bring out our food/refill water/anything we actually needed.   When we finally got our food it was greasy, completely and utterly bland, and just unappealing visually.   Now I'm hoping that today was an off day and the food/service and general experience here is much better normally, but I lost any interest in wanting to give his place a second chance ever again after this initial experience.   TL;DR: do yiurself a huge favor and go across the street to com tam thaun kieu or any other establishment in the Mekong Plaza."}
{"text":"Chicken pho was okay. Thought it needed more seasoning and touch of salt. If Unphogettable wasn't across the street, I probably would have given this place another shot.   Got the #1, #7 & #13."}
{"text":"This place is a keeper! A friend brought me to Wing Lee for the first time. My review is for the stir fried rice stick with seafood and vegetables #22. The seafood included shrimp, calamari and the best cooked scallops I have had in a while. Both seafood and vegetables were very fresh. The sugarcane juice is freshly pressed when you order it. My next visit I will try the pho."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to this store to get my asian fruits, chicken, and authentic Vietnamese food. The asian fruits are always new and fresh. My favorite are the mangosteens and jackfruits. However, the price can be a little high but it's worth it for the great quality. They recently opened a restaurant that is attached to the store which has a lot of variety for your food option. I have tried the bun mang vit, bun bo hue, mi xao don, and pho, all of which is really good. The price is fair for the quality of the food ($8-12). Be cautious since this is not a fancy restaurant, just a place with chairs and tables for you to enjoy your food.   I would recommend this place if you want to try authentic Vietnamese food and fresh asian fruits."}
{"text":"I never had pho before and i must addmitt this restaurant was good and nice atmosphere very clean if asked if I would go back yes I would very friendly the servers were very helpful since I had never been there good parking easy access into the restaurant I definitely a must try for anyone that has never ate there"}
{"text":"Entrance leads to a small market that sells Asian goods and another door to the right is the actual restaurant. Food here is really good and portions are actually quite big. Servers are friendly and service is fairly fast. Ambiance is casual, but this place just feels really clean and neat to me, unlike other pho places that I've been to that's small and feels cramped. If you're in the area and craving Vietnamese food, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming here! The broth for the vegetable pho is so flavorful and no matter what I order, I am never disappointed. So glad I found this place! Beats the other pho places in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho spot in town. There other menu items are great as well. The place is clean, service is fast, and prices are reasonable. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  A 4.5-star Vietnamese place that I haven't been to?  We had to go.  Overall, place was clean, but service was not adequate.  The waitress spoke no English; I'm all for authentic food and don't expect a lot of English, but it was bad enough that I couldn't modify part of an order, then ended up getting the wrong thing (don't eat pork).  Tried to convince them to get me a normal pho instead, even offered to pay, but they thought I wanted to exchange it for free and refused, so I gave up and ate leftovers from my family.  Next time we will go to one of the spots at Makong across the street - both have better service and broth, so this place didn't offer anything better when it comes to Pho - didn't try the other dishes.  Was a disappointing Sunday lunch overall."}
{"text":"The best bún I've  had in town. Love the fruit smoothie with fresh mango. Very friendly service ."}
{"text":"Definitely need to check this place out if your in the area you'll be a customer for life"}
{"text":"First time here and I'm glad we chose this place. My wife and I have eaten Pho throughout California and Arizona and I am impressed with Winglee. The Pho did not need much additional flavor (I'm a lime freak so I always put a lot of limes in my soup). I will need to hit this place up a few more times to make any recommendations other than the Pho. The Tai Tea is amazing! It's prepared perfectly."}
{"text":"Being a Bay Area native that has eaten at countless pho restaurants in highly competitive markets such as San Jose, Oakland, and throughout the East Bay, Pho Winglee is BY FAR the best pho restaurant I have found in the greater Phoenix area.  The broth of their pho tastes just as \"Asian authentic,\" if not more so than the broth I've tasted at any of the pho restaurants in the Bay Area.  The restaurant is clean and tidy, and their service is impeccable.    In moving to Phoenix from the Bay Area almost 3 years ago, one of my bigger challenges is finding good quality Asian food to satisfy my Asian-native pallet.  I'm very elated to have found Pho Winglee!  The taste of their pho broth truly brings me back home."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it a 0 if I could. The quality of food and service has immensely gone down since it got more popular and expanded. Sad way to \"improve\" business.  The level of professionalism and service is unacceptable to any consumer. You lie to our face about not any having MSG in your food and product (you do)- or is it because you are oblivious and don't care what you carry or advertise?!!  I hate to even write this but I would never come back to this crappy place. It used to be my favorite place to go and tell my friends about... I would NOT recommend this place to my worst enemy. Sorry but it's true.   For example: they would serve you old stuff - they did that with my husband's Vietnamese drip coffee. They made it fresh, turn around put it in the fridge and gave my husband the old one that's been sitting in the fridge.  A huge turn off.  I love to support local business (which I have in the last 6 years) but in this case, they have consistently been giving poor service with their bad attitude and crappy food.  Sad, sad and very sad... pathetic."}
{"text":"This was my second visit.  I brought along some family and friends for a quick dish.  The service is really attentive and they are very nice here.  I have to say, I know they care.  The broth is SO important in a good Pho.  Both of my visits left me and the others in my party wanting. The food comes out fast and everything else is pretty great.  I'll add, that they are perceptive in the fact that they will ask you if you are sure if you want something that may be a little weird for newbies.  This wasn't that..."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! The food is so flavorful, not too greasy, it feels very authentic. I was able to try multiple dishes here and not a single one disappointed me. In addition to that the portions are generous and prices are affordable. The broth of the pho was the best I have tasted, it is so flavorful but not too overwhelming. The sugar cane drink is so refreshing, I loved it, not too sweet not too bland. On top of the amazing dishes and entrees here, the service was amazing. Everyone was quick and friendly. Overall, flawless experience, would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Awww some place, great fruit and good customer service with specially love their coffee, no where can compare to it. If ya stop by, ya gotta try it :))"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, and service! Ordered the #13 bowl with passion fruit and sugar cane drinks. Everything tasted very fresh.  One of the nicest and polite employees I've have ever experienced! Definitely would recommend trying out this place.   10/10"}
{"text":"WINGS tho. Perfect.   First time, I asked him if a sauce comes with them, he said \"No sauce, you'll see\". He was right. Best wing I've ever had."}
{"text":"Absolutely a horror show. Filthy from the front door to the back room. Nasty dirty empty, and with good reason.  Horrible service and food. There is a reason this particular place is deserted.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing broth, noodle, and fresh ingredients.  I wanted to try the chicken pho because of all the great reviews, but since I was craving for beef pho, I had to go with it.  It surely didn't disappoint me. I usually go to Pho Da Vang, and I thought their pho was one of the best in town. However, after trying the pho here, I'm not sure anymore. The price is little higher for sure, but the fresh ingredients and deep flavor of the broth makes up all for it. Plus, they give you a lot of noodle, which I wasn't able to finish it.  Also, their beef is the most render meat I ever had especially for pho meats (other places are little hard). Plus, they put an ox tail meat which is super healthy and a rare ingredient to put it in a soup. They only opened it for more than a year, and they're already killing it. The owner also have a small Vietnamese grocery store right next to it for several years, which make sense for their fresh ingredients. The recipe was developed by his wife at home, and it really shines through their food.  I thoroughly enjoyed every soup and bite of the beef pho. I'm planning to come here more to try other awesome stuff. I would highly recommend this place, and this is by far the best pho place in the valley for now."}
{"text":"One of those sparse, no frills places with outstandingly fresh & flavorful food. From the somehow simultaneously luxurious and light pho (served in bowls bigger than your head), to the addictive, jerky-like char beef coated in a fine dice of peanuts and scallions and served on a soft bed of vermicelli noodle... you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Vietnamese food has always been a big favorite of mine and not all places are the same. These guys definitely have their game face on and are serving some of the tastiest treats that I've had in a long time.  There is nothing like a great Mom and Pop restaurant that serves delicious food and also offers excellent customer service. This is not a high end restaurant and the decor is very simple with basic table and chair dining. No fancy booths or expensive statues or Picasso paintings. Just high quality fresh food for a very affordable price. Nice!  Update 5/2017:  Freshly remodeled with very comfortable booths and a very elegant and cozy atmosphere. So relaxing and a big improvement from before. Come over and check it out.   Ordered the XL Combo Special Pho on my first visit. It has all the typical Beef cuts that you would see in similar restaurants including Oxtail, Brisket, Rare slices of Eye of the Round, yummy Tendons (my favorite), Tripe and the famous Viet Metaballs. What makes their Pho so good here is the broth. It has so much more flavor than other places and it made my eating experience so much better.  On my second visit I had to try the Shaking Beef Dish. It comes out on a sizzling plate and the sounds and aroma of the dish gave me goose bumps. \"So good\" I kept repeated to myself over and over. They actually use Filet Mignon and the texture is so tender and buttery that it practically melts in your mouth.  Got a chance to meet the very friendly owner while eating and he was very concerned that my meal and my level of satisfaction were on point. We talked a little and he told me about how they cook their broth for 12 hours so the flavors have more depth. He said a lot of other restaurants only cook their broth for a short period of time or use the instant Pho powder. What!?  Looking forward to coming back and trying out their whole menu. There are a couple of Catfish dishes that I'm already dreaming about. One of them shows up in a clay pot. There are also several Noodle dishes that are on my list to try as well. They even have fresh Chicken and several other cool ingredients next door at their store.  See ya there around 11:00 for lunch during the weekdays. I'm so lucky to work only a couple of miles away. TOUCHDOWN FOR THE TEAM!  4.75 STARS"}
{"text":"I really enjoy a good bowl of pho. unfortunately I wondered into this place. I should have known when it was completely empty that it wasn't going to be a good experience. I never complain about the service in aVietnamese restaurant but the guy in this place was beyond rude and was completely a miserable person . in a good pho restaurant you can smelt the pho but in here there was no smell except a slight sewar type smell . To make a long story short the pho sucked and the bun bo hue my wife had was truly horrible.  This place has now officially taken over the mantle of worst pho in Az from unphogettable. If you are in the area please do your self a favor and avoid this place. Try going down the street to pho thuan Thanh or to Khai hoan restaurant."}
{"text":"Good Pho... would come back... I wish they included more than a single packets of plum sauce n sriracha, but it was still great considering it wasnt dark or spicy as I like it from the plum sauce. IJS... noodles were great, fresh basil, fresh bean sprouts, fresh jalapeno, fresh lime. The decor was a lil sterile, like a cafeteria, and it had an odd odor, but the service was pleasant. Its kinda lumped in with a store.  Thai iced tea wasnt the best, but still good."}
{"text":"I really wish I could get my hands on those chicken wings right about now. The sweet glaze was made with fish sauce so it definitely had an Asian flair. I enjoyed it; my fiancé - not so much. He tried a bite but he couldn't get past the fish sauce.  We also got an order of egg rolls because I usually enjoy them at Vietnamese restaurants. I didn't enjoy them much here. It may be that the egg roll skin was too thick and the egg rolls were skinnier than other places that I've had them. Instead of a fish sauce, they came with a sweet & spicy dipping sauce.   For my main entree, I went with the catfish in clay pot. It came to the table bubbling hot and I thought it was yummy. I would get it again.   My sister went with the shaken beef dish. She has been here before and said she liked it. I took a bite of the beef and the meat was a bit too tough for me.   My fiancé enjoyed his big bowl of pho and my parents enjoyed theirs as well. I would be interested in coming back to grub on some wings and maybe try something else on their menu."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place for lunch or dinner . Everything is just awesome here. We got the spring rolls and the egg rolls to start. Best I have ever had in Phoenix. And then the beef plate on hot plate!!! You guys got to try it. They r not known much in the valley but definitely a must try for all in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Three stars for the food. The dishes taste like it was pre-made already and it was not fresh. I feel like the cutting restaurant is cutting corners with the food. I would not dine here again."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a month now and each week they update the restaurant!   Their food is consistent and amazing. I love it! Try the \"Asian\" style chicken wings, they're tasty.   The waiters are funny and very attentive."}
{"text":"Stumbled this restaurant while shopping at their WingLee market right next door and I'm glad I gave this place a try. The waiter greeted us and sat us down.  First off, please bring your own water if you decide to come here. Their water is not filtered and it taste so horrible!  Second, the waiter was very nice and polite. We ordered their special bun vermicelli and I am so glad to order it. It was so good! Everything about that dish is good! My wife and I also order their spring rolls (goi cuon) and nem cuon and it was also good. We both prefer their nem cuon more because the meat was very savory and juicy. I love their dipping sauce.   I would definitely be back again to try their Pho! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"A Vietnamese place that delivers!?? Hallelujah! This place was so good it's making me rethink my other 5 star reviews.  5 out of 5 stars for their seafood in crispy fried noodles bowl (it's amazing and looks like a delicious little birds nest.  So crispy and tasty! SIX out of 5 stars for their wings, yum yum!  Had the bun bo hue as well which was very good.  Maybe a 3.5 to 4 out of 5 but I'm still giving them 5 stars and am excited to try everything on their menu!"}
{"text":"My fellow yelpers have succeded in guiding me toward yet another winner! The com bo luc lac (Vietnamese Shaking Beef) is the best beef dish I've had in a super long time. It arrives sizzling hot, the meat is so tender and very juicy and the entire dish just bursts with umami - my taste buds were in utter ecstacy! It comes with either steamed or fried rice, and I opted for the latter. The rice was a perfect complement - delicious in its own right with bits of crunchy crackling, but mildly seasoned enough so as not to distract from the shaking beef's amazing flavor; it comes with some cucumber slices and pickled julienned carrots which serve as an excellent palate cleanser in between luscious bites of the entrée. The restaurant is bare-bones plain but clean and spacious, the service is very courteous, and the prices are great. I so look forward to coming back and trying the other dishes the other reviewers have suggested."}
{"text":"Very good Vietnamese food, the Pho is some of the best I've had in town. Also the selection of exotic fruit from around the world is amazing. You must try it."}
{"text":"When I lived in Philly, my apartment was one block away from a very good Vietnamese restaurant. I loved their pho and have been trying to find something comparable since I moved to Phoenix. And now I can say this is the best pho in the Phoenix area. Very delicious and reasonably priced. Love it."}
{"text":"Decided to drive out and get a fresh bowl! If you are looking for fresh pho or bun... Check them out. Staff is very friendly and the owner has an eagle eye for detail!"}
{"text":"Love this place food is great love the pho workers are very nice and friendly I would come here again very clean"}
{"text":"Wing Lee is a restaurant/grocery store. If you like mom and pop type places where the ambiance may be lacking but the quality and taste are on point then you have to try the food here. For now, the place may be a well kept secret since the sign on the building doesn't indicate that there's a restaurant inside, but I predict that the word will spread soon enough because the food here really is delicious. The prices might seem a tad high, but the portions are perfectly filling. We ordered the chicken pho (their speciality) and Bo LuC Lac and chicken wings with fish sauce. Everything was well seasoned, fresh and tasty! It's definitely the best tasting pho I've had at a restaurant around here. For the pho, they use fresh chopped chicken that's bone-in and not just shredded chicken. It comes with a spicy ginger dipping sauce which is a wonderful compliment to the chicken, but it's spicy! The Bo LuC Lac with tender pieces of beef comes out sizzling hot with a side of fried rice. Overall, the food here is authentically delicious and satisfying. I'm hoping everyone will give this place a try because you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I can find almost everything I crave for here. They start to have more authentic goodies, and the customer service is great. They have fresh poultry, and baby quail baluts (which I love). Jackfruits and Rambutans are always in stock. The only complaint I have is I have to drive way too far to get here, but with all the exotic food I can get at this store? it shouldn't matter much."}
{"text":"Wonderful, unassuming little restaurant with great charm. The market is attached to the dining area and let's you know that this is an authentic Vietnamese spot. The service was wonderful with everyone being very polite and attentive. The owner clearly cares about his business and customers. The food was terrific. We had the grilled pork spring rolls which had wonderful texture and flavors. The Pho special was great. Large, generous portions with plenty of meat and noodles.   Looking forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"This was a great joint to satisfy your Vietnamese food cravings.  Everything is fresh and super tasty. I loved the pho with oxtail.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered the bun with pork and egg roll. The pork was seasoned perfectly and the egg rolls are delicious. Service and cleanliness are on point. Nice Vietnamese restaurant :)"}
{"text":"First time here was soon after their grand opening and service was painfully slow.  Pho was extremely flavorful which always leads me to think there is massive amounts of MSG (though I hope I'm very wrong).  Despite the ingredients, I love flavor-packed pho's with a nice coat of oil floating atop.  They also have pho ga with fresh chicken still on the bone chopped from the fresh(?) whole chickens they sell next door at their market.  You can even pick between dark and white meat pieces.    Came back today and they've remodeled and it looks nice and clean!  The service is now MUCH faster!  Pho still good but broth maybe a little less concentrated. The Buon bo hue was very good but oily and no pork blood or pigs feet if that's what you go for (not me). The nem nuong cuon was decent.  I liked that they were packed full of veggies instead of a ton of vermicelli.  The dipping sauce was too hoisin-y for my taste.  Overall, a great place for pho on the east side."}
{"text":"Both beef and chicken based Pho have excellent meat/spice favors.  Easily best in Phoenix metro area. Shaken beef is also excellent.  (hot plate beef slices).      My wife and I were spoiled by Pho in San Jose for many years.  This comes pretty damned close.  Friendly wait staff.  My family come here about once every two weeks.  Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't go to get take out! They serve the people at the tables 1st & not in the order they came in & ordered. When I got there & ordered the tables were all full. 3 tables cleared & refilled. 2 tables cleared & refilled. All the 5 tables that had filled after I ordered had all eaten & left & I still didn't get my food to go. 4 more tables came & went by the time I got my order.  All I ordered was vegetarian spring rolls, a side of white rice & a side of vegetables. (Which he looked at me like I was crazy to ask for sides of rice & veggies. when it was clearly listed under \"sides\" in the big menu he gave me)  Im going to go out on a limb & guess that in a Vietnamese pho restautant that turns out tons of soup & rice dishes that the rice & vegetables are cooked well in advance so will only need to be placed into containers. Spring rolls are appetizers & quickly made...so I am not sure why I was there for an hour waiting for food.  The food when I got it was mediocre at best. The spring rolls were dried & rubbery at the ends. The veggies & rice were what you would expect they were fresh & not over cooked.   I was hoping the food would be phenomenal due to my wait but sadly it was not worth a 10 minute wait & so certainly not worth the hour I wasted waiting for it. I will never go back.   Just before I left I started talking with the other \"forgotten to go man\"  who came in about 15mins after I got there. He had been there for over about 45mins still waiting. I bid him good bye & hoped he didn't have yet another 20 mins of waiting.  The trick is they get you to pay before you get your food. I would have left if he didn't already have my money.  The other to go man & I should have been given our money back for the wait & gotten free drinks or given coupons for free meals next time.  I understand it was lunch rush but you take orders as they come in the order they come in. You do t give special treatment to in house diners & leave your to go peep standing in a corner. The reason I get to go food is because I don't have ti.e to dine in.  If you own a restaurant you shoud understand busy times & get the help you need for those times. If you are short staffed explain there might be a wait time before you take an order.   With about 8-10 Vietnamese restaurants in a 2 mile radius it isn't like I don't have other options. I'm sure the other to go man will also go to one of the other choices too."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a suggestion because they have oxtail and although Pho isn't my favorite Vietnamese dish I do love it when you get that fall off the bone beef along with it. I started with the chicken wings because I noticed they made it with a nuoc mam glaze which was actually very good. Although the wings were good they were a mistake because I ordered the Pho Xe Lua(Train aka XL size) and could not finish the main event. The pho was flavorful and smelt strongly of the pho spices (Anise, Cloves) and was pretty good overall. While the food was good I can't award the fift star because the service was lacking because it looked like there was only one server/cashier and what appeared to be the owner running out to help sometimes so service was unfortunately slower. While I was leaving a buddy of mine was outside because inside is a market known for their chicken and he told me I should try their chicken pho which is my favorite kind so I will be making a trip back to try it out."}
{"text":"Just reading the reviews I totally expected this place to be amazing and it was anything but that.. I get their spring rolls as an appetizer and plain pho like I usually get from other places.. to start they brought my appetizer about 7 min after the brought out the pho ..  the pho itself was not very good.. noodles deff over cooked and flavor was okay.. but the rolls!! So gross.. gross flavor , lettuce tasted dirty and the meat was nasty I had to send it back ...  I have never sent anything back but I couldn't stomach eating it... way better spot across the street.."}
{"text":"The egg rolls were on point. It was so hot and crispy. It was seasoned to perfection. The Vietnamese Iced Coffee will surely wake you up. It's super strong and I liked it. The pho da biet broth was light. It was so comforting."}
{"text":"Absolutely exquisite Chicken Pho.  Many places uses beef broth for all of the Pho, although the chicken broth and flavor shines on this dish.  We also got the #13 which was a variety of meats, shrimp cake wrapped in tofu skin, shrimp, and noodles.  Everything was very delicious and we will go back.  Stopped in market on way out and got the sugar cane drink, banana drink, and some fresh Jackfruit.  Awesome!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! They gave me a ton of food my money, very detail oriented and my Thai tea was amazing! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Wow.  Decided to try this place due to a friends review.   Khai showed outstanding service from our initial greet to the very end.  He helped with questions we had, keeping our water topped off and just always having a smile on his face.  The manager also came to greet us with a smile.  Great team!   The food was just as great as the service.  I had the sizzling shaken beef, didn't get a picture because I was too excited to eat it!  Flavors were on point, and the fried rice that came with it was awesome!   We will be back to try the wing lee chicken"}
{"text":"The pho was delicious. Nice, rich flavor with a bit of grease. In Arizona, most pho broths lack flavor. I really enjoyed it here. The meat proportion was good. I did notice the prices are kind of high but as long as the food is fresh and clean!!! The rice dish with chicken was delicious. The fried rice had a yummy subtle flavor. My only complaint of the chicken rice dish is it was just breast, I would've love some dark meat!!"}
{"text":"First time here and enjoyed the Pho. The staff were very pleasant and friendly. It was busy when we arrived but food came up quickly. A nice fresh vegetable accompanied the pho."}
{"text":"Some Of the best Vietnamese food I've had in Phoenix ... recommend the pho, the rice with grilled pork chops, and the fried chicken wings...  passion fruit juice was also made of real fruit and not concentrate! Enjoyed the dinner thoroughly..."}
{"text":"Servers were rude.  If you're just coming here for the chicken not worth the visit.  You can get better pho from other places."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Arizona. Big bowl of special soup noodles not expensive and Staff are friendly. I recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Vietnamese food I've had in Phoenix. There are others that are great also. But I gotta say this is exceptional! The passion fruit drink mixed with honey is quite remarkable. The bitter and sourness from the seeds combined with the sweetness from the juices of the passion fruit and honey make it exotic and something of a kind. Also, there is a store next door as well were I bought 2lb of passion fruit. The pho is good (I got mine and replaced the beef with more tendon and tripe). Spring rolls were fresh and great tasting. Customer service was just as good as the food. Warm and inviting place. A perfect example of simple food at a simple price done legendary."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I ordered the pho ga XL. The soup was lukewarm and barely any noodles.. The chicken was pretty soft but too much chicken pieces w/bone for my liking... only thing I enjoyed was the ginger fish sauce. 13 bucks for a bowl btw... pricy to me especially when they are stingy w/noodles."}
{"text":"You will never get wrong with this place.  My husband and i order the same things every time we came in(braised catfish and Bun bo Hue).  The best in the State.  None of the resturans in LA beat the taste or price.   Too bad my stomach can't add more in. Want to try other dishes before we leave AZ.  The food are much better than any restaurants in LA.  2 thumbs up for this place."}
{"text":"I've been to so many pho restaurants in phoenix and a lot of them are pretty much similar in taste and food choices. Winglee when you walk in has this nice smell which was a plus because I knew right away the food would taste amazing.  Their spring rolls are to die for. Has shrimp and pork in it and the peanut dressing on the side made everything so good.   The pho was just amazing.. the broth was great and they even have ox tail in it making the price totally worth it.   This place has to be my favorite pho place so far. will come back"}
{"text":"Good reviews of this place got us interested in this place.   The common entrance with the grocery section of the store is not a good idea, in my opinion.  Somehow the view of produce and other items decreases my appetite. The restaurant side is bright & clean though, with its minimalist decoration.   The waitress was polite. She gave us the menu promptly, and brought water to us quickly.   The spring rolls (goi cuon) were made with very fresh ingredients. They were shorter than those of other restaurants, but they were \"fatter\", full of tasty herbs.  The dipping sauce was very thick and concentrated.  We had to dilute it with water.   The Pho Dac Biet (house special beef noodle soup) was typical.  Nothing outstanding.  The Bun Mang Vit (duck & bamboo shoot noodle soup) was fair.  Its broth could be more savory.  The rice noodle was overcooked and too soft.  The duck meat was fresh and tasty though, as well as the side dipping sauce.    Obviously, the chef or chefs of this restaurant has / have access to the fresh poultry & other produce from the grocery side of this business.  But I am unsure the chef / chefs know(s) how to take advantage of this freshness.    The main appeal of the grocery side of the business is the fresh poultry.  They only slaughter so many chicken, duck, etc. for the day.  So it is possible they may run out of certain type of meat at the end of the day.    The items on sale could be better organized and displayed for better appeal.  The items on sale have the feel of just being \"dumped\" there.  I understand this business is small and probably has very limited resources; but the owner(s) could pose quite a challenge to the bigger stores (Mekong Market, etc.) if he / they would try to figure out how."}
{"text":"Great food and the service was good also! Servers were very attentive and nice! Pho was good along with the riceplates!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service was great. And the environment is clean and new looking. Very impressed with the service and follow up during our visits there. Can't beat the price for the quality of food served."}
{"text":"Can't get enough pho lately as it's been very cold in the morning.   When I walked in, I became confused. I thought I came to a restaurant but it looked like a small grocery store. Restaurant entrance was to my right after I walked in.  Service was excellent. Staff was very friendly and attentive. My glass of water was filled all the time.  Pho dac biet, portion seemed smaller, meat didn't seem that generous compared to some other places I visited, but soup was very tasty. They do have an option to pay extra for large size if you are hungry."}
{"text":"One of my favorite parts about the restaurant was the menu had pictures for every single food item. Very helpful if your some what clue less like I am. The Pho soup was one of the best I have tried! Everything from the noodles, meat and large ratio of shrimp! Definitely get more then what you pay for! We will be regulars going forward."}
{"text":"You know it's good pho when there's real chicken or beef fat in it! Lots of places use just seasoning mixes for pho broth, and don't simmer their broth with bones and meat like they are suppose to.  This place does it right! The Bo Luc Lac  or \"Shaking Beef\" is very good, and one order can serve two quite easily. They use real filet mignon so it's super tender.   Can't wait to come back.   The owners are friendly, as well as the wait staff. Sure their English isn't perfect and they aren't seasoned servers, but you can communicate just fine by pointing to photos, numbers, and being friendly!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you! Great food, good portion size, super casual.  Did I mention the food was great? Looks like they hand make their Spring Rolls too; better quality and taste than most others."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time yesterday and ordered a Pho Tai, Thit Bo Luc Lac & Com Chien, and a large sugar cane drink. The Pho Tai wasn't as hot when it came out as I'd hope and the broth is very fatty. The thit bo came out sizzling hot which was really appetizing. And the sugar cane drink was not too sweet (which I don't mind) but at the end of the drink there was a lot of precipitates that irritated my throat quite a bit. Overall the food was 3.5 -- the service was good..they're nice people (they came to refill my water even when I didn't even take a sip of it yet which I thought was funny). Overall food was 3.5 and service was good."}
{"text":"The food here is honestly the best! The price is extremely affordable, because the food here is beyond flavorful! If you go, you NEED to get their com bo luc lac. It's basically cubed beef with rice. I've had this dish multiple of times because I'm Viet, and I've never tasted something that is this good! Honestly you NEED to get this dish!!"}
{"text":"How pretty was my lunch today? I love that this restaurant is attached to a little market and drink shop. I got fresh passion fruit juice and my mom got fresh pressed sugar cane juice. Both were amazing! The thing that kind of looks like a hot dog is actually shrimp paste and tofu. First time trying that (wasn't bad btw)!! I could not get over their seasoning, so good. However, the meat was a little fatty. The service was amazing though. Everyone we interacted with was so kind and helpful. A+ on the customer service and decor."}
{"text":"Too much star anise in the broth. I prefer sweeter. Will stick to the phone on the other side of the street."}
{"text":"Some of the best pho in town.  recommend the chicken and beef special. Across from the Asian market so you have some adventuring after as well."}
{"text":"It wasn't clear how to enter the restaurant until you get to their locked door.  You enter through the grocery store.  Pleasant staff who greeted and seated us quickly.  We sat with the menus barely open when they came for our order.  I noticed this action for other customers as well.   I like bún but none with chicken.  Even though they have pho with sliced chicken, the server said they don't make that dish with chicken.  Seems it could have been substituted.   I ordered 26, combination seafood with rice stick soup and hubby had number 14, vermicelli with char grilled pork.  They brought the orders separately.   Both dishes were flavorful and tasty.  Water was refilled. Prices are reasonable. Plenty of parking in the lot directly across from Mekong Market."}
{"text":"We know our PHO and Winglee is now the best in the Phoenix metro. The broth is hearty not a product of powdered seasonings. The fresh Asian chicken will surpass anything on the organic market today. The service at the restaurant and market is friendly and helpful and they even carry many specialty items you cannot find at Mekong or Lee Lee."}
{"text":"There food was really very good! I know..i know.. its expensive but its worth it :) I think this is the best vietnamese food I ever had. The place was clean as well because its still new.. The owner was pretty awesome."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese restaurant in-town. Very authentic. Been here couple of times and have been trying many different dishes and i love them all. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Yes.  This is authentic, delicious Vietnamese food.  Pho and egg rolls were the real deal.  They need to post their menu online, but go anyways and order once you are there.  Great service too."}
{"text":"This place had the best Pho ever! The Chicken Pho was amazing. They also had tasty,strong Vietnamese coffee. The prices were very reasonable as well. I would recommend Pho winglee to everyone!!"}
{"text":"egg roll - very good spring roll - pretty good fried calamari - very good chicken wing - pretty good pork and shrimp cake with rice - pretty good shaken beef - extremely good. best i've had from a vietnamese place. the natural juices from the steak gives it the best flavor passion fruit drink - pretty good coconut milk - pretty good service - pretty good"}
{"text":"Two words get the 4th star. Open Sundays! I've tried pho tai, bun, egg rolls and fresh spring rolls. It's probably not award winning food but it's good and consistent. I liked the pho a lot and the bun was good too. The broth isn't fatty, flavorful enough with lots of yummy add ins. I wasn't thrilled they wouldn't give me a half order of spring rolls so that was a lot for one person and they don't keep well, and I wasn't too keen on the peanut sauce. I usually fix it up great but it did not work as well this time. Liked the egg rolls with the fish sauce quite a lot. Inside a little market, not much on ambience but they are great with service. I want to try the shaking beef, it smells great and seems to be popular. Strong, sweet, delicious iced Vietnamese coffee to go after a pho breakfast is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! And freaking delicious. Very very clean place, cleanest one we've been to, and we've gone to almost every Vietnamese place out there. Pho was a big portion and the spring rolls on point. Service was extremely friendly and very helpful, especially since we had a baby. It's a mess, but they are so kind and helpful with the baby and mindful! We live in Laveen and have continued to go here because of his beautiful and yummy this place is."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing. The owner gave us great recommendations for what dishes to order. Great environment and priced very fair. We will be visiting often!"}
{"text":"Best pho in the valley this place is where I'll be dinning from now"}
{"text":"I've been to a fair share of pho places and I was quite surprised here! I got the pho with shrimp, and the broth was very yummy. I also really liked the noodles in particular; they were soft but not too soft and they didn't clump in the middle like other pho places (kind of like packaged noodles are just plopped into the bowl). Our serve was really friendly and super attentive to me and my boyfriend. He engaged in a lot of conversation and was quite funny :)   The only down part which isn't too serious was the location. It's kind of in an area with a lot of traffic/accidents. It's also inside of a grocery store, but I don't mind too much honestly.   I'll be coming back to try some more things ok the menu!!"}
{"text":"1st time here. Great service. Pho was very tasty! Spring rolls are wrapped really tightly, I like that. Large portions. Would definitely come back when I'm in this area."}
{"text":"If you guys are looking for quality, this is the place to go to. I ordered the Pho Xe Lua. The instant you taste the broth, you can already tell that it isn't your typical Vietnamese place. I talked to the owner and they make their broth by soaking bone which takes more time than the typical restaurant. The broth itself is something that can either make or break your experience at a Vietnamese restaurant. It was lighter and not as heavy, making it an easier meal to enjoy.  Aside from the broth being wonderful, they provide oxtail which was extremely soft as it tears from the bone easily. They were generous in their meat and provide a variety of greens if you ask for more. Again, this isn't your typical Vietnamese restaurant. The owner cares for your well being :)"}
{"text":"The food here is quite tasty! I ordered Com Bo Luc Lac. This place was just opened recently. At first walk in it a mini market with newly fresh veggies and live chicken for sale! I was told they are using the live one to cook whatever food they serve that have chicken in it.   1. Com Bo Luc Lac was delicious! The meat is amazing the not chew at all! The smell will wake you up! The look is quite enjoyable! Over all it a really nice place for a new place! I left the place with a big belly! A lot of food and very good recommended for everyone to try at least one!   I would give the place more stars if i could this was an amazing experience!!!"}
{"text":"We had the chicken Pho, the sliced beef Pho, egg rolls, spring rolls and the sugar cane drink. The service was great, I love the fact that they serve free range chicken. Pho flavor was good, very good! Fried rice was good too. The only reason why I'm not giving them a 4 or a 5 star is that the price is a little too high compared to a lot of other good Vietnamese restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"The best pho. I have tried many and I love this place You can tell they spend a lot of time making their broth it's super yummy."}
{"text":"these guys have a small restaurant area in the back:  1) fresh passion fruit juice and fresh pressed sugar cane juice is delicious 2) their chicken is very fresh 3) the pho is fantastic.  service is very friendly though not all the servers speak fluent english.  deep dive review on the pho. the broth is light yet very flavorful. brighter tasting than many and not too rich while maintaining good umami. they often times will throw in a piece of the broth meat/bones like oxtail in the bowl. only complaint is that the noodles are a touch (and i mean very slightly overcooked). if the noodles were springy, i would have no reason to drive to da vang on the west side."}
{"text":"Review 6/10 for the 10 bookmarked businesses to review before the end of 2016! From Meagan B.'s thread: https://www.yelp.com/topic/phoenix-yelp-phoenixs-10-firsts-of-2016  There's nothing I like better than to have Asian comfort food when it starts getting chilly in AZ. Pho Winglee has a wide selection of noodle soups, rice dishes, and rice noodle dishes that will satisfy any craving for Vietnamese food you might have.  The restaurant shares space with a small grocery store that sells goods catering to the Southeast Asian palate. The restaurant area itself is no frills, with minimal decor and your standard setup of tables and chairs. The menu though is filled with a lovely selection of mouth watering food. We ordered some spring roll and egg roll appetizers, and I had the #28 shaking beef with fried rice.   The shrimp spring roll was filled with vegetables, shrimp and rice noodles. It was refreshing and delicious. The pork spring rolls were decent but the meat inside had more of a chewy texture so I liked the shrimp version more. I didn't try the egg rolls but they looked very good, fried until perfectly golden brown.  The shaking beef was AMAZING. It came out on a sizzling platter, blistering hot with steam rising from the meat and vegetables. It was made with onion, red and green bell pepper, and beef chunks. Once it had cooled down enough to eat it, I was in heaven. The beef was so meltingly tender and buttery (Due to the texture and also because they add melted butter to the dish). I had to give everyone we were eating with a piece and they all agreed the beef was out of this world. The vegetables were well cooked. The bell peppers were crisp and sweet, and the onions were soft, caramelized and browned.   My friends ordered pho dishes which were huuuge. You could dunk your face in one of these bowls and go bobbing for noodles and meat if it weren't for the 2nd degree burns from the hot soup ;). I will definitely have to get their pho next time!  I also indulged in a passion fruit drink, made with fresh passion fruit. I loved it. It was tangy sweet, and so refreshing. It was a perfect compliment to go with my beef dish.  Service was friendly and the owner? (Or manager?) stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our meals. He also helped us with explaining some of the selections they had in the mini market. You can tell he puts a lot of pride and effort in his business and I love supporting small businesses that are like his.  So if you are craving a taste of Vietnamese cuisine this is a superb choice!"}
{"text":"Struggled between a 3.5-4 for food. DO NOT ORDER THE BO LUC LAC. It doesn't have the flavor that this vietnamese dish is supposed to. The beef is chewy and soft and gross. It's also technically supposed to be on top of lettuce. There's supposed to be a give to it when you chew it. It just tastes like normal beef with a hoisin sauce. I'm extremely disappointed considering so many people have posted about this dish.. I'm surprised that NONE you have had real bo luc lac and chose to not note this, otherwise I wouldn't have paid $13.50, which is on the expensive side compared to the other restaurants. The beef isn't supposed to be doused in sauce either.. AT ALL. It's supposed to be tough and chewy. That's the specialty of it. This was like soft mushy beef- just basic beef with bell peppers. That's the only thing I'm extremely pjssed off about.   My mom, born in Vietnam, said that Nem Nuong isn't that great either. She makes great dishes and knows when one isn't good. Service is nice, food is average. Spring rolls are thick but short and small. Not worth the price, but you do get 3. On the bright side, you do get 2 egg rolls in your dishes when you order a vermicelli dish. My father who's also from Vietnam said the vermicelli was too thin, these complaints made it a 3 star.   Bo Luc Lac is SHAKING BEEF. Should not be sizzling-- That's SIZZLING BEEF. There's a difference. Don't advertise something else. If you love sizzling beef, get it. If you're expecting shaking beef like it said, don't get it."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, easy, quick and the food is fabulous.  Very casual, no hassle.  Spring Rolls, noodle soups, everything is excellent.  Have ordered the soup for take out and is just as good at home or even a bit better if i am in my pajamas."}
{"text":"Fantastic Pho! Best broth I've ever had in Az! Wonderful pork chop and rice, too! Check it out  sometime, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wing Lee has the best Vietnamese coffee hands down. It's the best quality of ingredients that makes the difference. When we learned of the newly added restaurant section we wanted to try based on their high standards. We were not disappointed! The pho is the best I've ever had anywhere period. The broth and quality of beef are superb. There is even a big piece of oxtail. We will come back and try other items soon."}
{"text":"I frequent Wing Lee for Asian fruits, fresh free range chicken, and other specialty items, and was glad they opened a restaurant. The banh mi sandwiches were good, but a tad skimpy in the protein. The nuoc mia (fresh pressed sugar cane juice) is a perfect refresher for the Arizona heat. If you're feeling adventurous, try the doi huyet (blood sausage with Vietnamese coriander and lemongrass)."}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: I am not the type of person to be rude to employees. I respect their hard work even when the food is not as good as I was expecting and it takes a lot for me to give a one-star review.  My mom went there for lunch and the place and our experience was horrible to say the least. Everything was bad except for our waiter who was very nice and pleasant. I didn't get his name. I'll try to keep this brief.  I ordered the chicken pho and my mom ordered the flat rice noodle dish. My mom's dish looked good but the fish smell from the seafood was unbearable. Keep in mind that she has eaten here many times and enjoyed the food and we have had this dish at many other places and it never smelled this bad. My mom very kindly asked the server to take it back and send her the spicy beef noodle soup instead. He comes back and says the cook says that they're out. It's barely 3:30 on a Monday, they close at 9:00 PM and they're out? I don't think so. My mom then proceeded to request another dish and then this time the server comes back and tells my mom that the cook said if she doesn't like how they cook here then don't eat here. Wow. Talk about an arrogant sense of self-entitlement. Try working at an American ran restaurant and see if that flies with management. The chicken pho was also sub-par, bland and not very flavorful.  As if that wasn't enough, my mom returned a few minutes later because she forgot something and then one of the owners proceed to ask her outside to harass her for about 15 min. about the last time she was here and how she kindly requested to return a chicken she bought that was bad. She bought a chicken along w/ a bunch of other groceries and put it in the fridge, when she got it out to cook, it was damaged, she brought it back to exchange and was rudely yelled at about how he wasn't gonna exchange it and how she should have called the day she bought it. Disgusting. This guy and the cook need to grow up and learn some manners, this isn't Vietnam where you can treat your customers however you want.  On top of that, the place did not look very clean, the dining area looked like it was under renovations and the little store connected to it looked the same and rather dirty. The dining area had poor lighting.  Obviously, I will never be going here again and highly advise everyone else to do the same."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled pork vermicelli...the pork was so flavorful, veggies were fresh.  I read another review where someone mentioned the water was nasty, and it is...I've never had the drinks they had listed before, and wasn't feeling very adventurous.  After ordering i saw they had a cooler w/ can sodas.  Service was prompt, and they came and checked on me after receiving my order.  Will definitely be back to try the Pho."}
{"text":"My rating is 4 stars only because when I got there almost ever table wasn't cleared yet, but that's because they seemed to be short staffed. Other than that it was an awesome experience. Food was good, portion was good and service was good. My server noticed that I coughing really bad so he came over with a halls. Sweet gesture"}
{"text":"Always in search of Pho restaurants, I came here with a  friend of mine for a weekday lunch. The restaurant is attached to a grocery store, very clean, atmosphere simple and does the trick. The service was excellent and the people that work there are extremely nice and friendly.  Of course we ordered Pho, I ordered the #9 Pho Tai with rare slices of steak, I opted to add the extra Tripe to my order. We also tried the fresh Spring Rolls filled with Shrimp and Pork. The Spring Roll were OK, filling perfect, skin/wrapper a little tough.The Pho was EXCELLENT, the broth had a wonderful taste, my bowl was filled with meat, tripe and noodles. The extra add-ons were fresh and we were given a good amount.  Atmosphere standard, Service excellent, Pho excellent!"}
{"text":"Service sucked , water tasted like sour tap water , and it took forever to get only 4 egg rolls."}
{"text":"I've been eating Pho for 15 years in CA and Az, but this place is definatley Top 3 on my list. Very, very good Steak Pho and very inexpensive at $7.95. If you are in the area, please stop and you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"So happy to have discovered this place! Came here about a month ago and loved the food so decided to come back again :) it's connected to a tiny market but the restaurant is off to the right. They recently remodeled and it looks amazing! Total transformation. The owner is very friendly and welcoming, as well as the waiter. We are a huge fan of Pho Thanh in Phoenix, but since they are far from us.. this place will be our go-to here on the East side :)   Very generous with their portions. They give you 3 egg rolls/ 3 spring rolls versus the normal 2 that most Vietnamese restaurants give. The size of their bowls are much bigger as well ! The broth is very flavorful and not oily. The \"birds nest\" was the best I've had in AZ. It had full sized scallops, which I've never had in my dish before. That sold me because I'm a sucker for scallops :)   We will definitely be coming back whenever we have a Pho craving which seems to be about every week :) love love love this place. Try it!"}
{"text":"First time eating here.   This place is delicious . My vegetable Pho was so flavorful and had lots of vegetables in it.  The place is inviting and clean.   Our waitress was awesome. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I would like to start out by saying that this place is amazing. The employees are extremely friendly and the servers are even better. They attend to your needs above and beyond and I have never had such a good experience at a Asian restaurant. The pho there is amazing and the chicken wings were the best chicken wings I have ever had in a long time. I will for sure attend this cuisine again."}
{"text":"Bomb Pho. The broth is wonderful. I wish their meet was a bit more tender though. 4 stars because their water is DISGUSTING, like straight up from the sink I felt like. Other than that, pho and coffee and chicken rice were on point ."}
{"text":"To be honest, we were going to the hand draw noodle place in the same shopping center but they were closed for summer vacation. Too bad so we decided to go to Winglee. My son was excited cause Winglee is on of his favorite Vietnamese.   Anyways, you walk in to this Vietnamese grocery store and to the right is glass double doors for Winglee. Just seat yourself. It seemed very clean and somewhat modern Asian to a point. Has a bunch of booths with tables in the middle for larger groups.   We started out with the Grilled Pork patties and the Spring rolls. The grilled pork patties looked almost like spring rolls but had thin slices of marinated pork. Boy was this good. Really fresh, tender, very tasty. Very different. Never had this before. Really loved this plus put in the dripping sauce and bam. The spring rolls had shrimp and pork. This was really good. I could tell the difference between these spring rolls and other places. Seems like these are made to order and really fresh. Again same dipping sauce which was outstanding. Loved this so much.   I ordered the pork chops with broken rice, some bean curd wrapped with grounded shrimp and a salad. You get two marinated pork chops that were very generous. These were really good. Cooked perfectly and so tasty. The weird thing that I never had was the bean curd wrapped in ground shrimp. Very different but not bad. It also came with a  small Vietnamese salad which was very good and fresh. This was a really good meal. Fresh, tasty and filling.   My wife had the seafood fried rice. I didn't really get to grab a taste but it had shrimp and other seafood. Very nice portion. She was very happy with this meal too.   The service was okay. Not great. I would say their service was inconsistent because of the kitchen. We had a table of 6 and they  would bring two dishes at a time then wait for awhile for the next two and so on.   So I would have to say that this is probably one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants because of the food. Really fresh, real tasty, really good, and I love their selection. The service could be better but it's doable as long as your not in a rush. Just enjoy and have fun. The ambiance is great. Very Asian  and very comfortable.   So again. It's my favorite Vietnamese. What else can I say but we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"New place for some serious choices on Pho and other speciality items . We tried a few new things a Seafood bowl with scallops shrimp octopus squaid and more and it was delicious. The bowls of PHO are HUGE ! We had the one with everything and even an oxtail in there. Tried the chicken fried rice with free range chicken was good too. The place is very clean and mordern look to it. Ask for WALLY he will take care of you good guy with a great attitude. They also have a store connected offering various exoctic fruits DRAGON FRUIT / JACK FRUIT FRESH, free range poutlry and Vietnamese products. We ate and went over to look and walked away with even more ! We will be back for more see you soon WALLY !"}
{"text":"Great new little restaurant attached to the Vietnamese market. Clean and very minimalistic setting, very no frills also the waitress we had spoke very minimum English. We had the chicken wings, shaking beef and the chicken pho. The chicken wings were very delicious, fried and then sautéd with onions,peppers and probably butter. My boyfriend claims its his new favorite wing spot. The shaking beed came sizzling on the an iron platter and was tender and buttery as can be. Probably not the best if you are counting calories but definitely worth for the show, The pho chicken was a derivative from our usual pho escapades, but I thought it was worth a try since the market is know for its fresh chicken. Pho was pretty good and light a good change of pace from the usual beef pho. The chicken was tender and full of flavor although hard to eat depending on the bones. Will be back to try some of the other dishes."}

{"text":"So much flavor... I went here tonight with my sister, we have been enjoying Vietnamese food all our lives. And at this point we are pretty good judges. The roasted pork was something dreams are made of, just the right level of sweet and savory. The portion size was generous, and I went home with left overs. The spring rolls how ever we're not the best and I'll skip them next time. The waiter was a bit cold and didn't really care if we were there are not ( lol it didn't really bother us).  The cute little store attached is a great place to pic up some Vietnamese groceries. And they have some homemade treats to taste. ."}
{"text":"Got the 6xl Pho for 10 bucks it deserves 5 stars big bowl noodles cooked perfectly lots of meat big chunk of oxtail bone and a very clean but fatty broth, a little different than most pho broths but in a good way, will definitely order again"}
{"text":"Definitely disappointed! They made good food before with better quality when they needed customers. However, when they had enough customers, they changed the price (since November 2017) but with food quality was decreased. We order one #6 (pho xe lua) and one #11 (pho dac biet), we just had the same size, less noodles, a few pieces of beef slices and meatballs, the soup was dark and a lot of fat on the top. We also order Mi Hai san and it was bad too. We did come here many times before but we will never come back based on what we got on the last visit."}
{"text":"Ok, we tried a New Vietnamese place,, Forgot how we even found out about this place..   Wife had Beef Pho/a , and she said it had some great flavors, but was missing a lil something compared to our other places.. I tried it and it was really good, the oils from the beef broth were good, but the missing ingredient, wasn't missing just not as strong as most places.. Cilantro.. hint hint. The Cilantro flavor was barely noticeable, and that's a peeve for the wifey..   I tried the Sizzling beef plate, with fried Rice on the side. .. Ok, the marinade on this beef (rib-eye i believe), was delicious. Cooked a tad over my liking which most places cant cook med rare even if you ask .. but it was so soft and fell apart in your mouth.. Never seen this as a Vietnamese option before thus had to try, and will definitely eat this again.   Ok,, Vietnamese restaurants are almost on every other corner and they thrive cause we all have a different opinion about what the flavors should be and which ones we like more than the other, whether its culturally accurate or not.. That being said, my opinion, this place borders on the top 5 for me in the East Valley. Yes I will be back, but I have my top 2 still closer."}
{"text":"The owner came over to us and asked how was the meal and we said it was great! Explained to us that he cooks his special broth for the pho for at least 12hrs while the competition cooks it for 5hrs. We believed because the broth was intensely flavorful. The iced cafe always taste bold not watered down like lee's sandwiches and their Thai iced tea didn't give us a stomach ache like the others. You gotta try and will believe!"}
{"text":"I have tried the pho, salads, and rice dishes all have been amazing. The quality of the beef has been expecially delightful."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place but for the its so so. She like the dish that is served right to your table still on its hot plate! Very tasty and super hot! The Pho is good but nothing I have not seen before. Even though I love Pho, the other dishes are worth my money."}
{"text":"I tried Number 24 and it was amazing. The place is very nice and the service is great. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Vietnamese food! A wonderful fresh meal! I highly recommend coming here for a true quality meal."}
{"text":"New restaurant that is attached to Wing Lee- we ordered the the fried rolls, Shaking beef, and pork sandwich. The rolls were meh but the shaking beef and pork sandwich were incredibly tasty. Very good cuts and quality of meats used in these dishes. We normally frequent wing Lee for their Vietnamese coffee and sugar cane drink; this time we got the jackfruit smoothie - a favorite now."}
{"text":"This place had good reviews and backed them up. The restaurant was very clean and had quick service.  The food was very good and pretty well priced.  I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place is located right next to a live chicken processing plant as well as a grocery store but never let the setting of the restaurant fool you.  This place is very clean with all the sauces labeled for anyone who is not familiar with the Vietnamese cuisine.  The big star comes their superior restaurant quality appetizers and their drinks (sugarcane juice).  I can assure you that my mother is even impressed with their offerings.  Their service is a little over the top and will constantly check and make sure you are happy.  Their Bun Bo Hue is slightly over seasoned but they never cut corners on this dish.  It is slightly more expensive then their competitors but if you don't mind paying a dollar for much better quality of food, you have found your paradise."}
{"text":"Due to many positive reviews from my Yelp friends, I had to try Pho Winglee. This place is mini grocery store and restaurant in one. You enter through the grocery store and it looks like you can order boba drinks there as well. As you turn immediate right as you enter, there will be a door that lead you to the restaurant.   Being first time here, we wanted to try everything. We opted for combo pho, bun bo hue, Korean ribs, glazed chicken wings and BBQ pork rolls. Have to say, everything was delicious. The Korean BBQ, not so much. Our favorite was the pho. It had good flavor broth and the meats were cooked perfectly. I was expecting oxtail because it was in the picture on the menu but it didn't come with it. The BBQ pork rolls didn't have any noodles in it like all the other places do, but it had carrots.  I think it made it more refreshing; very nice surprise.  Overall, very good place to grab some pho. Will return soon."}
{"text":"The place itself was clean, people were friendly and food was good. BUT..how is no-one talking about the iced coffee here? Wow. So so good. It has created a craving I just can't kick.   Try it if you like pho. You will dig it. Walk around the authentic grocery next store if you're getting it to go. For goodness sake, try the coffee."}
