{"text":"I LOVE Apsara Cafe. They have some of the best Thai food in Pittsburgh hands down and believe me I have taste tested a lot of Thai restaurants. My favorite is the green curry noodles. They put huge cuts of fresh vegetables in the delicious curry and its so flavorful without being too spicy. Perfect combination!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I've dined in and gotten take out from them several times and have yet to order something I didn't like.   My favorite has got to be the green curry noodles with chicken! I crave their green curry and order it pretty much every time I eat here. The short ribs appetizer is also delicious. I've had a variety of the items from their menu and was not disappointed by any of them!  I went recently with a large group 8+ people. I called ahead and they had very nicely arranged the tables in the center of the restaurant to accommodate all of us. Plus, the staff was incredible. Our \"waiter\" was the owner and he checked on/chatted with us and even brought out his mother, the chef. It just made the whole experience even better knowing this nice family was running the restaurant together.   I'm not sure why this place is empty every time I go in because it really is a wonderful place to eat! But at least you know you'll never have long wait times, like most places in the Southside."}
{"text":"Frequent this place more than anywhere else in the south side. Cannot understand how Thai me up is busier than this place. The food is delicious and portions are much bigger than Thai me up. Also, they use way more produce. Delicious curries too. Wait staff always friendly and it's BYOB. Love this place."}
{"text":"New Thai on the Southside!  What a great surprise to see what appeared to be a vacant building suddenly open up as a Thai restaurant.  The decor is beautiful and everyone who works there is really nice.    I've already been there twice and plan to make this a very regular spot for lunch.   There are so many options on the menu, and everything I've had so far has been terrific.  Lunch specials are very reasonable- $7.95 for a nice sized entree with soup and spring roll.     Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Service was good and dishes came out timely.  Carful when ordering the level of spice as they have three chefs with different scales.  Better to get a 5 and add to the desired level.  Can never go wrong with Panang!"}
{"text":"Love the saramann!!!! I really enjoy this place. I must say there is not anything I did not like. The curries are fresh and staff is friendly. Only thing is staff service is slow during the day/weekday.  It is my go to place for thai on Southside."}
{"text":"Nice Thai and Cambodian food on East Carson street. I gather there might not be a ton of nice dining options on this street, but was pleasantly surprised by this.   Girlfriend ordered cambodian rice noodles, and I ordered tofu red curry. Both had nice flavors--the rice noodles were sweet, tofu was cooked well.  They asked us how spicy we would like our dishes to be on a scale of 1 to 10. I somewhat overzealously asked for an 8 and they honored my request. It was quite spicy (I was able to finish it, but there was a little pain involved).  I was impressed by the spiciness (especially since the dish didn't have any visible chili flakes).   Nice intimate decor and lots of natural lighting.   We also got mango sticky rice-- that was good, but not life-changing (and a little expensive)."}
{"text":"Second visit, not nearly as impressive as the first. The food was still terrific but the cleanliness left something to be desired. My daughter shook her napkin and a little bug fell out. We sat in the window table and there were so many flies, we moved to another table. We discussed leaving but convinced each other to stay. Food came and was delicious but I'd still thinkcagain before going a third time."}
{"text":"I would give this place a solid 4 stars.  The decor is very nice and the staff is very friendly.  I have been living in the area since they opened and I must say the young gentleman that works their (seems to be owners son) is very professional and friendly.  I have come in on several occasions both during the day and late-night.  The food is always good. The only negative thing that I have to say is that my last few visits the food has been somewhat disappointing.  It seems obvious when the owner/cook is making the food.  There is a lot of room for improvement.  On this note, I used to always love getting their calamari.  It was always nicely seasoned, light and crispy.  But the last few times it has been bland, heavy and greasy.  :(  The food here has a lot of potential and room for improvement.  I will still come back and recommend it to people.  But if I don't see improvements I will stop."}
{"text":"This place is crap! Their food is good but the operation is so inconsistent it's impossible to order take out from them. We call multiple times during the week for lunch and no one picks up the phone. When they do the cook Is not there and can't make food to order. I called tonight and they don't take cards. I have given this place so many chances to step it up to normal standards. They never have and they never will. Don't call here for food! You will be disappointed every time!"}
{"text":"This was my third time dining in. The food and service have always been great. It seems very clean and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. Menu is an amazing value for what you get (a filling lunch for two will cost you under $20). Dinner portions are large enough to be shared. Everything I've tried has been delicious, but I should mention that the butternut squash soup is especially noteworthy. I would highly recommend trying it out during lunch. The restaurant is BYOB so pick up a bottle of your favorite wine on the way."}
{"text":"It pleases me to see the many four-star reviews for Apsara, as it deserves to be better known as one of the top Thai restaurants in Pgh.  The reason that it does not have a packed dining room is the location.  Yes, Carson St is a hoppin place Thursday through Sat night, but those wanting a great dining experience are not going to fight the South Side crowds, and parking, to go out to eat.  But, they should.  Go, find someplace to park, and you will be so glad that you did.  If Apsara were located in NYC it you wouldn't be able to get a table.    I can't wait to go back !!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience. Food was ok..I asked for spicy but got mild. The waitress served with a smile but it took 40 mins for my entrée to come out. Asked for chili paste which never came. The gal was running the check counter and waiting tables so I pity her"}
{"text":"This is actually a Cambodian restaurant and one of the most authentic Asian restaurants you will find anywhere. The curry is amazing. They roast their own herbs and create their own curry rather than simply mixing a powder or paste. They've got a number of more familiar dishes to appeal to the unadventurous but do yourself a favor and eat your way through the menu. The Cambodian family that runs this has had at least 3 other restaurants going back almost 20 years, and this is the one they have most poured their heart into. Don't confuse it with the Cambodian Kitchen next door (an unfortunate trick of geography) which sells Asian food and kielbasa...nuf said."}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant with friendly service. Easily the best butternut squash and coconut cream soup I've ever had! The curry was absolutely amazing as well. If this place was closer to me I would probably end up there at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Went in again but sober this time. Good food. Great service. The only complaint is \"numba ten spicy\" is barely spicy at all. Maybe I need to ask for \"numba twenty spicy\".  I got some pork curry that was good. Plenty of basil in it. The lady got General Tso's Chicken, which was surprisingly good. The place just needs more heat. I shouldn't have to dump an ounce of the chili oil paste on it to warm it up."}
{"text":"As part of the South Side Art Crawl this June, a day long of vending and talking with other arts people down at the Beehive eventually required sustenance.  As someone who loves both all things spicy and Eastern, Apsara Cafe certainly caught my intrigue.  I had grabbed a takeout menu from a very nice host, and later ordered the Panang curry.  There was so much!  Definitely worth the price, as leftovers are guaranteed.  This curry starts at a 4 spice, but I was able to request a 10, as I most usually do when going out for Thai or other similar cuisine.  It was definitely spicy!  This of course was fine with me, as I love my curries this way.  I was also able to request steamed tofu rather than fried.  Great customer service, and a tasty meal!  I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"I came here with Rob Y. while he was showing me around Pittsburgh. We were walking down Carson Street looking for a potential \"fourth meal\" when we passed by Apsara Cafe. They had a stand outside their restaurant selling finger foods (satay, vegetable kabobs) to the most-likely intoxicated passers-by. We stopped for a few seconds to look, when a cute little old Asian lady came outside immediately to greet us and welcome us in. We turned her down initially, but came crawling back soon after. Whether it was guilt from saying no to a lady who resembled our grandmothers, good salesmanship or just plain old hunger, we walked in and it turned out to be a great decision.   The physical space and ambiance was nice compared to the other seemingly squalid storefronts on Carson. From the tables and chairs to the hardwood floor, everything looked new. Aspsara is also decorated with small fixtures and artwork which adds a nice touch. The service was good. The lady welcomed us with open arms even when they were officially closed according to their displayed hours. Our orders were taken promptly and waters were refilled constantly. We were treated like family. The food was also on point and I doubt I could find any better Thai/Cambodian food in Pittsburgh at 11 pm on a Saturday. We ordered the Chicken Red Curry and Chicken Pad Thai to share. They were not the best dishes I've ever had, but they were still very flavorful and portions were large. Apsara Cafe is definitely a Thai restaurant you should check out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here often for our Thai food fix, excellent authentic flavors that are not \"dumbed down\" for the American palate (i.e., drowned in sugar); highly recommend the soups, the ribs, noodles, as well as the curries. Beautifully decorated space as well!"}
{"text":"Tried to go on a Sunday at 1pm when the website and sign on the door said they were open and they were dark and locked."}
{"text":"Best Thai tea I've ever had in my life and the chicken pad Thai is phenomenal. My fiancé got the red chicken curry and loves his meal as well. Awesome service to top everything off. I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Very pretty space with very nice food. The pumpkin coconut soup is excellent and the Pad Thai is delicious. Once you walk past the storefront with weird plants you step into a very nicely decorated restaurant with room for a dozen or so tables. The Thai/Cambodian decor and music is as lovely as the menu."}
{"text":"Hands down best thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. Food is always fresh, restaurant is nice, and price is reasonable. Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for the authentic quality of the place when I saw all the paintings of the Apsara goddesses and the earthy decorations. It is definitely a beautiful restaurant with a very calming atmosphere. Being there and seeing all the Apsara paintings made me nostalgic of my days spent in Cambodia. However, for a restaurant located in Southside, there wasn't much business.   The service was wonderful and the food came out quickly. I ordered the curry noodle bowl with green curry. It was pretty much rice noodle and vegetables in a coconut curry sauce. The curry sauce was creamy and super tasty on the first bite, but I quickly got sick of the creaminess and could not finish my bowl. Also, the rice noodle was too mushy and overcooked. My eating companions got the pad thai and the pad thai fusion. The pad thai was a bit too bland and again the noodle was too mushy. The pad thai fusion came drenched in curry sauce, but the sauce was way too sweet.   Overall, the food okay (I have had worst), but just okay (I also have had better). I'm only giving it three stars because it lacks that authenticity that I crave--less sugar and more fish sauce please!"}
{"text":"We were trying to go to a new place we had never been on the Southside & after the positive reviews decided to try Apsara. We were happy we did.  They did a nice job renovating. It looks very nice. The waitress was nice & patient while we reviewed the menu.  We ended up having the pineapple fried rice which we've had many places & enjoyed despite no spice level. Usually that kills the dish, but it still was very good. We also had a dish that tasted like beef stew over white rice that we really enjoyed.  If you like Thai, I'd give this place a try."}
{"text":"This was some of the best food I've ever had. Popped in during the late night specials and got the General Tso's, teriyaki chicken, fried rice, and dumplings, all drizzled in General Tso's sauce. It was delicious. I woke up craving It the next morning! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"BIRTHDAY WISH COME TRUE! I LVE This Place! Found it during Art Crawl, i was Magnetized to it, bcz of pics outside...but Indide sooo elegant, fine dining atmosphere with fine dining service! Our waiter was soo professional and Sweeet! He was Such a Gentleman! The Food...OMG! The Bessst Pad Thai EVVVER!!! Annd i got the fish & coconut curry...it was to Die For!!!! The prices were great Too! We got 2 Thai teas, and a Bunch of Food w/ Lots of leftovers for merely $60. BEST PITTSBURGH SECRET!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Pittsburgh. fresh, authentic and an overall great experience. Danis was our server. Trust what he recommends."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is a gem!!  Awesome food, fresh flavors, variety of Thai dishes, Unique Thai decor, pleasant hostess, and reasonable prices for a lot of food. Definitely would return and recommend. Pad Thai Fusion was Delicious. Parked one street over parallel to Carson on Sarah.  Just be patient. Worth the drive over from University of Pitt during Parent Weekend."}
{"text":"Elegant airy atmosphere with nice Thai/Cambodian nik-naks and golden Buddha statues here n there.  Some impressive paintings on the wall of Thai / Buddhist scenery . I had the coconut lemongrass soup which was on the small side, portion-wise but very delicious once it cooled down enough to sip ... i'd love to see them offer a bigger portion of it  than what they are currently offering... next, I had the fish cakes which were delicious with that peanutty/vinegar sauce that comes with them ... I could eat those everyday !   Then came the Pad Thai fusion w/chicken ... an impressive portion size (nothing bothers me more than Thai restaurants that are stingy on portion sizes and bring you a tiny plate of Pad See Ew or Pad Thai ... this one was a good amount of noodles on the plate ... Very tasty if under-stated (i'm sure they're so accustomed to \"is it spicy ?\"  \"i dont want it too hot\" from the wimpy Pittsburgh palate people that come in ... mine could've stood to be hotter / more intensively spiced... next time, I will ask for it to be hotter ... I look forward to returning and trying the other dishes on the menu, there were so many ..."}
{"text":"I have always left Apsara satisfied and full.  My go to is the red chicken coconut milk curry. The portion size is large, it's reasonably priced and the flavor is out of this world. The spice level does fluctuate however. They measure the spice level from 1-10 and ask you what number you want before you order. Every time I've been there it has been different. There have been times where a number 8 spicy was unbearably hot and other times where it was hardly noticeable. But besides that it is a solid spot for Thai/Cambodian cuisine. The atmosphere is okay if you are into Hindu gods everywhere. Service fluctuates with who the personnel is. I've been disappointed at times but most of the time it's solid."}
{"text":"Apsara Cafe is a very solid Thai/Cambodian restaurant and an overall fantastic addition to the offerings on E. Carson.  Unlike typical Thai restaurants, Apsara sets itself apart in that it also offers Cambodian food-probably one of the few places in Pittsburgh that has such an offering.    The actual restaurant is unlike that of the surround neighborhood: clean, neat, quiet, and somewhat romantic!  The service is friendly and timely.  Menu selection is robust; pricing is competetive with that of other Thai restaurants in the city.    We started our meal off with fresh spring rolls.  They were large, had plenty of tofu stuffed inside and came with perfectly crafted peanut sauce.  Very very solid.   For my main meal I ordered the Cambodian rice noodle pasta with Tofu, veggies and what appeared to be pad thai sauce.  Unlike traditional pad thai, the noodles were softer and larger.  The dish was fresh, tasty, and dare I saw somewhat more satisfying than a traditional pad thai.   Overall the meal was great, the service was solid.  A few notable deficits: 1.) their hot sauce level request is absolutely pathetic.  When I ask for an 8/10, I expect my food to actually taste spicy, not sweet.  2.) why would you hide the chopsticks and make me request them?  Come on!  Beyond that, this restaurant is a great addition to the area and I highly recommend you check it out.  I was also intrigued to see that from Thurs-Sat, the restaurant is open until 4AM.  Something to consider..."}
{"text":"Got takeout for lunch here and it was delicious! I got pad thai and it was really good... Not too heavy on sauce, veggies were crisp and delicious, good amount of chicken.   Inside was beautiful and bright. Not what I expected... It was very elegant looking. I'd like to eat inside sometime. It was totally empty though. I would hope around dinner time it might fill up a little...  I love spicy food and usually order a 9 or 10 on the spicy scale as most places never make it that spicy. I got my pad thai at a 9 and it was almost too hot for me to handle, so order a few notches down from what you normally would.   My noodle dish came with soup and a veggie egg roll. I picked wonton. Soup had one wonton in it and was just okay, but then again I always think wonton soup is just okay. Egg roll was tiny, like the size of my thumb, but I didn't mind because the size of the rest of my meal was larger than expected.   Large noodle dish (plenty to split or have leftovers), soup, and an egg roll for less than ten bucks.  I'll order here again."}
{"text":"Decided to check it out after passing by a thousand times. It was a recommendation that finally got us to stop in. Went in during prime dinner time on a Friday night and there wasn't really anyone else there. By the time we left, another group came in, but it wasn't busy at all. At our table we had Pad See Yew, Drunken Noodles, and another chicken dish that I just can't remember :/  Our server didn't ask the spice level but when we mentioned it, she took it down. Actually, I sadly have to say that the service was the worst part of our experience. Unfortunately, she was borderline rude, really unhelpful with recommendations, and just generally disinterested in our table.   The food was sadly less than mediocre Thai. My shrimp see yew was the worst of the three. Something was really off there. It tasted like no see yew that I have ever had, and I use that dish as kind of my standard go-to when measuring Thai places against each other. We won't be going back, which is a shame because it's very close to where we live."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place when they first opened about two years ago. I came with my cousin for lunch and thought the entire experience was mediocre and never felt impelled to return.. Until, a friend of mine told me they have pad Thai fusions......  Yes... Pad Thai mixed with curry! What!!?!??! I had to return and try this magic! We came on a Thursday around 1- it was deserted. We sat at one of the cute tables right by the window, so we could people watch- naturally, it's southside. Our server was extremely friendly!   I was very impressed with the fact that their lunch specials come with soup AND a spring roll. Pretty sweet! I ordered the lemongrass soup- delicious, baby mushrooms and tomatoes in a spicy broth- perfection! The spring roll was mediocre and was not served with a lot of dipping sauce, so I improvised and dipped the egg roll in the soup! Delish!   As for my entree, I ordered the tofu pad Thai fusion of course! The curry that I mixed with the pad Thai was panang curry. Oh my goodness... So let me say, I've been to my fair share of Thai restaurants and I never finish my lunches, ever. I always have to take some home. This portion was large but I ate all of it! It was so good! The flavors were awesome ! Not spicy but packed with flavor! The tofu was not cooked the way I prefer- it was pretty squishy, but I notice that most restaurants do not know how to prepare tofu correctly.   I will return for more of the Pad Thai fusion!"}
{"text":"I was super happy with the atmosphere and the food! Spiced great and it won't burn your mouth. The waitress, who is also one of the owners, is so nice and pleasant and always checking in on you as if you were in her home.  The lemongrass soup was a great small portion to stat off the meal and there was plenty of rice for a healthy lunch portion next to my curry.  Very happy and will come again"}
{"text":"We love the FCR a café tonight for dinner we both had soup to start my wife at the butternut squash soup with coconut. I chose to have a special soup with shrimp. Then we split up the pineapple fried rice with shrimp entrée and there was more than enough for both of us."}
{"text":"Great addition to the South side! The spring rolls were fast and delicious. And the Pad Thai was great (a little heavy on the onions, but that's just me). The owners are wonderfully friendly as well!"}
{"text":"I would have given this place more stars, but I thought the service just. Wasn't that good.  That's a deal breaker for me, especially since it wasn't all that busy.    However, the food was delicious.  We had the eggplant dish and shrimp with fresh ginger and pineapples.  The eggplant was good, but cut into these really large pieces.  This wouldn't have mattered if I had been given a knife to cut it up.  And our server was nowhere to be found.  So if I was basing this rating on the food alone, it would be 4 stars.  since its combined with the service, I give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"I recently discovered Thai/Cambodian food and tried some for lunch. I had the shrimp with a spicy garlic sauce and large flat rice noodles which I love and a coconut and vegetable soup with a wonton and dipping sauce. This is a small clean space with good food."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Thai inspired places in Pittsburgh. I think this might be one of my favorites. The did was spectacular, the service was awesome, and it was inexpensive. It is a BYOB. I can't wait to go back the drunken noodles are the best."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Started with miso soup and an egg roll. Ordered swordfish shish kebab and apsara fried rice. Love the Apsara paintings and statues. Service is okay but needs more staff."}
{"text":"So I decided to do a little bit of exploring on the south side since I don't know the area very well. I know it's replete with restaurants and stores, so I was knew it wouldn't make for a boring afternoon. I decided on Apsara Cafe. I'm a fan of Southeast Asian cuisine.  Apsara didn't disappoint. When I walked in there were only two other patrons in the restaurant. I soon ended up being their only customer. The dining rom is very open, bright and clean.  I settled in, browsed the menu, and choose the chicken panang dish from the lunch entrée menu. Wanted to stretch my dollars. It comes with soup (I chose Lemongrass and a vegetable spring roll). The soup was very flavorful but I didn't care for all the tomato chunks. The ratio between soup and veggies was off.  My main dish came out and it was delish, delish! The portion too was spot on. Was even able to take some home. My server even gave me an extra, small container of rice when she boxed up my leftovers.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to eat here for a while and I finally did this week. My boyfriend and I are big fans of Thai food and like trying different places. We really enjoyed our meals here!!   See Ew noodles with beef is my usual thai food order. They were delicious! They have a good amount of sauce and come with mixed veggies!  I loved that they came with stir fried veggies- it added more to the dish. I did not add a spice level to my order, so it was not spicy. I would definitely order this again, but the rest of the menu also looked delicious, so I might have to branch out!  My boyfriend order the red curry scallops. Neither of us had had a curry meal with scallops before. They were very good! It was served with rice and lots of scallops! We split the short rib appetizer. The sauce on the beef was really tasty!   All of the portion sizes were good! We had a great service. Our waiter was very friendly and gave great recommendations! We will definitely return to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Company keeps changing hours and only putting a sign on their door, so delivery services have no idea they aren't open.  This has been going on for months.  The owners pulled down their Facebook page because of complaints.  Don't order from here."}
{"text":"I have walked past this restaurant numerous times and have always wanted to try it! I finally did this week! I went in on a Tuesday night and it was empty...so we had great service! It is small, intimate place with soothing music and a lovely decor. The portions are big-so come hungry! The food is great and you will eat it all! I had the Pad Thai Curry! I saw it on the menu and knew that I had to order it! It was awesome!  I would definitely come back just for it! The menu is extensive and the descriptions looked tasty!   We had great service! The prices were good and the food was great! I will definitely come back here to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I was meeting my hubby for lunch and we were not sure of where to go when we recalled a friend saying that this new place had opened and it was very good.  After our lunch, I have to concur... it was very good... it was great actually, and we cannot wait to go back.  They did an amazing job with the space.  It is a really cute spot... awesome for a date night.  The colors, décor, etc. all is wonderful. The service was great... she was super attentive and kind... and we never had empty waters (which is always a way to score brownie points with us).  The lunch prices were great too... 7.95-8.95 for a lunch combo where you get your choice of soup and a veggie spring roll is a good deal if you ask me.  We also ordered the fresh spring roll with tofu app which was awesome.  The sauce was yummy too.  I got the Chicken and Broccoli which was great... the sauce on it was better than most that I have ever had.  The hubby got the Pad Thai w/ Chicken and he seemed to enjoy it quite a bit as well.    We find ourselves eager to get back here for dinner.  If you want to try something new and different in the Southside, I suggest trying Apsara."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended to us by a staffer at REI.  We couldn't have been more pleased. Delicious, fresh, stunning presentation and leaves me wanting to live in Pittsburgh so we can come back more frequently.  Two appetizers and three entrees for under $40.  So good!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the few places where I can find Cambodian food in Pittsburgh, so I am pretty interested in trying some of the more exclusive things. It was already past closing time on a Friday night, but they were selling some fast street food outside the door and the kitchen was still open, so they accommodated us with a table inside. Their menu has a good mix of both Thai and Cambodian dishes.  We got a Moarn Chha Kroeung, which is their original stir fry of vegetables (plus a protein) in a lemongrass sauce, as well as a Lot Chha noodle. The portion sizes were quite large. The former was pretty tasty, though maybe with a bit too much sauce. The noodle was really good, with the short spongy rice noodles standing out.  If we got Thai food I wouldn't call it the best around, but for Cambodian dishes I would come back for more."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm pretty sure I have been here at least once a week for the past 4 weeks. Their lunch specials are the best! Every lunch comes with a soup and spring roll! My favorite is an Apsara original, pad Thai fusion, it's pad Thai with your choice of curry, either Panang (my favorite) red, or green curry. Last night I got a season special, butternut squash coconut soup! It was AMAZING!! The waitress is so nice there as well, very attentive but not overbearing. I plan on trying the more adventurous selections next time! Last night we also got their calamari, light and crispy with a delicious dipping sauce. The calamari could have been bigger. It's also a great location right in south side, one of the few places with outdoor seating! Always my first choice for Thai! Would like to see it be more busy!"}
{"text":"I've probably eaten at Apsara 10 times since they opened and have not had a bad dish. My favorites include the Haw Mook, the Coconut Lemongrass Soup with Tofu and the Saramann. They don't seem to have the dinner menu on the website but they are open for dinner, might want to call first at night because I've gone down a couple of times to find them closed. (Still sorting out hours of operation?)"}
{"text":"Great food! Service wasn't exceptional. Would go back multiple times :) atmosphere was really nice and peaceful"}
{"text":"There's something about Cambodian Thai that I just can't shake and Apsara is my go to place whenever I need my fix. The portions are great and the food is consistently good. The spice level varies from visit to visit so be careful near the higher end of the spectrum, and while friendly, the service is sometimes slow. Try the red curry!"}
{"text":"The short story is - the food is OK but unless they get a waiter who can rise above surly I don't think they are gonna stay in business.    When my party entered sunday evening the waiter approched carrying food for another table. He looked at us sadly. I asked if we should seat ourselves anywhere. He shrugged as if he didnt care one way or the other and why would I think he would.  We should have taken the hint but we stayed, and it actually got kind of funny.    I guess Cambodian is probably their specialty but they serve Thai and Chinese and fusion.  I ordered Mee Bompong, a Cambodian dish.  He came back shortly  \"We're out of C15\"  lol.   I ordered something else.  As I say the food was OK. I've certainly had better and more authentic Thai but my companions were happy with theirs.  I asked for Nam Pla Prick, the ubiquitous Thai condiment of fish sauce with sliced chilis. He gave me the stare and I explained what it was.   Maybe he'd had a bad day.  Maybe his dog had died.  By the end of the evening I was wondering if we were on a hidden camera show."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Saturday night at about 9:30, and we were the only two in the restaurant!  (Maybe because it doesn't have a bar and it's on the South Side!)  Service was quick and friendly.  The food was delicious and VERY spicy! (Relative to other Thai places in the city, but much appreciated by me!)  I got and would definitely recommend the green curry noodles with tofu.  My husband got drunken noodles with beef and felt that the portion was a little small, but mine was HUGE so I gave him half of mine.    We would definitely come back to Apsara."}
{"text":"Thai food is my favorite, so I am always looking for new places to try. I walked past this place a bunch of times on my way home, so I finally caved and ordered take-out for dinner.    I love spicy food, so I always ask to get my Pad Thai as spicy as it can be. However, some places never make it hot enough which is frustrating. This place definitely listened and made it exactly how I like it and the flavor was awesome. It was also a huge plate for only $11.00.   The woman working there was also super friendly and even though I only got take-out, I noticed the pretty restaurant decor on my way out.   Next time I am going to go to eat there rather than just get take-out. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"So good, I mean, soooo good.  My wife and I went in for our second visit and I was really shocked that so few other people have given Apsara a try.  It's newly and tastefully renovated, clean, and has some really authentic menu selections.  My wife is a vegetarian and I'm a die hard carnivore and we're both able to find plenty of great options.  Both times we've visited we have left with plenty of food for another complete meal. Finally, the garnishes are works of art, carrots have never looked that good.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Not pleased with the thai food.   The dishes weren't nearly spicy enough, and there was nothing special about it the dish either. It was like every other thai place but this one was more expensive.  I got the pad thai fusion with red sauce.  While the presentation was very impressive, the taste was nothing even coming close."}
{"text":"*sniffle* That's not a runny nose due to spiciness, it's a sad sniffle. I really wanted to like this place...   I heard great reviews of Apsara and as a huge Thai food fan, I couldn't wait to give it a try! On a Friday night, a friend and I decided to order takeout. Since this restaurant is Cambodian/Thai fusion, their menu is extensive. When trying a new Thai place, I tend to order some of the same dishes that I get at every Thai restaurant. In my book, it's the easiest way to compare and rank the food. I liked the options on Apsara's menu but I stuck to my usual...to start, I had fresh spring rolls (cold, non-fried) and the Apsara healthy soup. For my entree, I ordered the veggie drunken noodles, medium spice level. My friend ordered the fresh spring rolls and spicy mixed veggies with rice.   I realize ordering takeout is a poor way to judge the service but I have to say that the waiter who processed my order was incredibly dry. He didn't know the menu when I asked for clarification and his lack of enthusiasm did not entice me to come in for a sit down meal.   After the lackluster interaction with the waiter, I was pleased to find that our spring rolls were bagged separate. This made me very happy since I've ordered Thai takeout too many times where the cold and hot food was bagged together. The spring rolls were cold & fresh but lacked a punch to the palate. Minimal basil with a lot of cheap chopped iceberg didn't sit well with me. I used a lot of the peanut sauce to add flavor to every bite. Next up, the Apsara healthy soup. This was tasty & I would order it again. The flavors pulled through and the vegetables were slightly crunchy & not overcooked. It was a light, nice portion size for an appetizer. After the soup, I had high hopes for the drunken noodles. Wow, was I wrong. I hate to say it but it tasted like the dish was cooked in water. It had the right coloring but the only flavor I got was biting into the vegetables. I tried mixing up the sauce from the bottom of the container and no luck. No spice, no spark of flavor in the sauce and the vegetables couldn't save it. My friend didn't have a variety of spices so I added salt & pepper to salvage it. The veggies and noodles were not overcooked but I was looking for a distinct flavor. My friend wasn't thrilled with her dish for the same reasons but was pleased by the spice level. They at least added a punch of chili pepper to hers.   I'm not sure if I will give Apsara another shot. Thai me up is a few blocks away and while they are not my #1 for Thai (Nicky's or Pusadee's are my favorite) I have never had a flavorless dish from Thai me up. I see so many good reviews for Apsara so I hope this was just an off night for the staff."}
{"text":"Very delicious Thai food! The staff is wonderful as well! They offered delicious suggestions. Everything was clean and the restaurant itself is beautiful. We loved the trellis around the ceiling gave it a nice outdoor feel."}
{"text":"We recently moved here from DC and this is by far the best Thai we've had here. We ordered the lemongrass coconut soup, chicken prik king, and one of their house lemongrass specials. Everything was extremely well balanced and legit spice. Service was excellent. This place deserves to be packed."}
{"text":"My co worker and I went down here for lunch and boy am I glad we did.  I had spring rolls soup and we each split the C6 and c12 on the lunch menu.  Both are wonderful and the waitress was friendly, and efficient.  The place looks like it will be pricey  from the outside but the prices are VERY REASONABLE.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Presentation: on point Decor: on point Cuisine: on point  Looking for a nice Thai dinner out and about? Definitely go to Apsara! I'm not saying that this is the best Thai food I've ever had or that it stands out, but it is very good - and combined with a wonderful mix of modern furniture with traditional decor and tasteful presentation of the dishes - it will be an enjoyable night out!   Also, there's these cool tables up in the front kinda on a stage, but surrounded in curtains that have windows out to the street, so you're like on display but also secluded and it would make a really cool first date spot!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great service. Beautiful restaurant too, quiet ambiance. One of the best places to dine in the south side."}
{"text":"So after having a fantastic dinner at Cure early in the evening, my friend from college and I headed down to Carson St to check out the Saturday night life.  For some damn reason, I wanted to eat again at midnight, haha.  As we walked by Apsara Cafe, a little old Asian lady spotted us, and came outside to encouraged us to enter.  Being two AZNs (my friend and I), it's hard to walk away from an old lady promoting her food.  In case you didn't know, if you have little old Asian women, you'll usually get great food.   Food (8.25/10) = So we pretty much just asked what she recommended.  Two dishes.  Chicken pad thai and chicken red curry.  Both winners.  Don't know how this place compares to other thai places in Pittsburgh, but this restaurant does serve delicious food regardless.  Surprisingly what impressed me the most was the clean crisp hot tea they served.  Usually the Asian restaurants serve the cheap tasting stuff, but the tea was probably the part of my second dinner I enjoyed the most, hah.   Ambiance (9.0/10) = One of the nicest thai restaurant I've visited.  The decor is beautiful in my opinion.  The art work.  The figures of elephants and other animals surrounding the walls of the restaurant caught my attention.    Service (9.0/10) = old asian lady with hospitality.  Anthony Bourdain knows this.  He talks about it in one of the numerous episodes where he visits Vietnam.  Old smiling asian lady = hospitality = delicious food = like a second mother.  Overall Opinion = I came here for a second dinner.  Why?  I still don't know.  I wasn't hungry.  I had dined at Cure early in the evening where I indulged myself in meat.  Was it the old smiling Asian lady?  Perhaps.  Bottom line is, the chicken pad thai, the chicken red curry, and the tea were Double D - Damn Delicious, even with having a full stomach of cured meats, haha."}
{"text":"Drunken noodle, spicy level 7 with chicken and 2 egg rolls. Thought spice level was perfect and on scale. No wait, sat right in front table."}
{"text":"Grilled beef short ribs. Dinner Only. A house specialty. Beef short ribs glazed with wonderfully crafted Apsara marinade. Served in a crispy basket filled with green papaya pickles, ginger and garlic.  You know when you go to get crummy Chinese or shady pan-Asian at the grungy and run-down why-has-it-been-in-business-since-I-moved-to-town place around the corner and you know that what you're ordering will only end up being a poor reflection, a sad afterthought, an abhorrent attempt at replication of what you really wish you could order; yet you order it anyway, and everyone involved ends up slightly gassy and unfulfilled?  Apsara Cafe's grilled beef short ribs represent what all of those awful places are attempting to emulate unsuccessfully.  Usually, when I go to write a review, I like to browse first to see what other people had to say--so I won't say what's already been said (nice restaurant, nice atmosphere, okay service, blah, blah, blah). I agree with Rachel C. and wholly support her 2-star experience. However, I wonder if she tried the grilled beef short ribs.  Apsara Cafe gets four stars because of the grilled beef short ribs and the grilled beef short ribs only. Frankly, I don't really care about anything else on the menu. It's all pretty tasty but at the same time fairly forgettable. Except for those grilled beef short ribs. Grilled beef short rib God came down from grilled beef short rib heaven and gave us His grilled beef short rib goodness through the grilled beef short rib preachings of the chefs at Apsara. I could waste an entire paycheck on multiple orders of them and only feel slightly ashamed.  Seriously."}
{"text":"New place, with Cambodian, Thai, and a few Chinese dishes on the menu. Nice decor, hasn't gotten much attention yet, so was rather empty. Server was knowledgeable, even though she admitted she is of Filipino descent. Tried the Chha Mee, was pretty good. Wasn't aware that Cambodian wheat flour noodles are similar to what we are used to in Ramen. Will try and return to get a better review."}
{"text":"This is great food... Not sure how it's not rated 5!!! I have a very ethnic pallet, and for a random walk in... I wasn't expecting much!  I will now be a regular!!! Someone mentioned not spicy enough... Tell them u want the level 10!! And it's a guaranteed ear popping, sinus opening, mouth burner!!! These people have serious service, and authenticity!"}
{"text":"Very flavorful food and great service.  The swordfish skewer is a great appetizer. So is the scallops wrapped in bacon. I absolutely love their very tasty beef stew which is called Saraman. Their green and red curry are also very tasty."}
{"text":"Statues of ancient warriors and deities greeted us cordially along with an elderly woman and a young, pert server as Kay and I entered Apsara Cafe's doors this past Monday evening before the Lacuna Coil concert at The Rex Theater, making my end of the lady's belated natal day observance memorable for her.   Kay was in command, so she chose the Bacon-Wrapped Scallops. A tart, micro-salad of greens, allumetted cucumber, and ornately cut carrots served as a bed for the trio of brackish, saccharine bits of plump, pork-draped, skewered mollusks. Whet the appetite they did.   My entree consisted of something called Saramann. Similar in texture to a beef or lamb curry, the supple, cubed tenderloin bobbed up and down in the sweet, milky, lightly acidic pool of brown gravy that held whole roasted peanuts coconut, star anise, cloves, cinnamon, lemon grass, kaffir lime leaves, shallots, and garlic. As I spooned the sweet, meaty brew onto the fluffy mounds of white rice, I was once again reminded of how similar cuisines from around the globe can be and was left wondering who borrowed from whom.   A four-piece \"dessert sampler\" included the following: Golden Balls, Black Sweet Rice, Sweet Rice Cake, and Pumpkin Custard. The Golden Balls were a take on the Indian treat known as Gulab Jamun with its spongy cake and syrupy, fruity topping. The Pumpkin Custard was the densest. The rice cakes were an exercise in contrast -- the black sweet rice coming off as licorice-like while the sweet rice was rather mild. A highly engrossing quartet of confection, each morsel was a welcome detour from the rich, extravagant desserts I've grown accustomed to.   With yuppies, hipsters, and blue-collar folk enjoying themselves inside or skipping in and out with takeaway bags as we dined, it was apparent how Apsara has quickly and comfortably entrenched itself into East Carson's restaurant scene. Like sushi, Thai fare is no longer trendy and exotic; it's becoming a part of Americana. And for that, I am gladdened, establishments such as Apsara broadening tastes with ease, grace and a sense of tradition and hospitality.  P.S. We had the dining room to ourselves for the first few minutes of our meal. Business soon perked up quite nicely on a weeknight no less."}
{"text":"This place is very unassuming from outside. The inside is very clean and calming. The window seat is amazing for a cozy meal and people watching. I had the crepe and it was amazing. Even came with a side salad. I have had these crepes before else where in pittsburgh and they dont compare :)"}
{"text":"The food here is really excellent, and a great value for lunch. They have a group of regulars, identified by sentences like, \"I'll just sit at my normal table\", or \"I don't need to see a menu, I'll have the....\"  Those of you who want something besides the normal bar fare should check this place out."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and then so utterly disappointed with our takeout order.  The pad thai was so dry.  I mean there wasn't a scrap of sauce to be found on those sad, barren rice noodles.   They also forgot the noodles in my fiance's CURRY NOODLES, and they put egg in the fried rice even though we asked for no egg (I'm allergic).  When we called to explain there were mistakes in our order, the girl on the phone didn't put us on hold but proceeded to discuss the situation with her manager very audibly, though somewhat muffled as she made an attempt to place her hand over the mouthpiece.   They asked if we wanted to exchange the food...as in return the wrong orders in exchange for the corrected orders...very odd since this is a restaurant, not a clothing store.  We drove back down there, got our replacement food but sadly that couldn't redeem our meal.   The food was just terrible.  The fried rice was really oily and chock full of red pepper flakes.  The crispy tofu triangles didn't, well, taste like tofu.  The crispy breading fell off them and then we were left with a really tough, chewy, McDonalds chicken-nugget-like blob.  I can't really explain it but it wasn't edible. Maybe I just don't have a refined enough palate for Cambodian food? Think I'll stick with Lin's Asian Fusion next time I want Carson Street Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Great ambiance.  Good food.  If you are looking for a place on East Carson you could do much worse.  We wanted something that wasn't too far from Oakland and had vegetarian options.  The food isn't as good as Nikki's Thai Kitchen or Pusadee's Garden, but it is decent and worth a visit if you are looking for something in the Southside."}
{"text":"Eh. I wanted more flavor. Is that so hard to ask for?  I'm always excited to try a new Thai place because I feel like Thai food can sometimes be the most flavorful. This was not a palate party by any means. Just another Thai place... for now at least.  They ARE brand new, so I will give them that, but coming into an empty restaurant does not bode well. The place was deserted. And it's remodeled so well! It really looks amazing inside. Beautiful wood floors, nice tables and chairs and a very inviting environment all around. But when you hear your chair scrap across the floor as you're sitting down, you know it's too quiet in there.   I was excited to see a handful of noodle dishes on the list, so I went with the N1 Kuteiv Chha (Phnom Penh - Flat Oriental wheat flour noodles sautéed with Chinese broccoli leaves, fresh bean sprouts, eggs and scallions in Phnom Penh sauce). As I said, it just wasn't very flavorful. I could have done with some more broccoli and bean sprouts too. Plus, the sauce was a little too thin and drippy. They did give you a good amount of shrimp, which I enjoy. I hate when they scrimp on the shrimp!  I wouldn't be opposed to going back, but it would definitely not be my first choice either."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this spot and went early on Sunday.  Staff was full of character, aromas were delightful and food was great.  My only concern was the roach that I killed on the floor.  Maybe it was a fluke, ran in from the sidewalk, but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today on a recommendation from a friend and am glad I did.  Super cheap prices and large portions.  Delicious as well!  Will be back."}
{"text":"Best Cury I've had in the Pittsburgh area! So happy I found this place, don't let the lack of patrons fool you this is one of the best Indian meals I have had in a long long time.  I trust Rachel in that the Chinese dishes aren't as fire as their curry. This was my first time so I'm really not sure about the rest of the menu, when I go back I'll come and update. For now, GET THE CURRY"}
{"text":"We ordered take out today after constantly saying, \"we need to try this place.\" Welp, Yelp, it was mediocre Thai. I ordered the drunken noodle dish without being asked what spice level. That's not necessarily a bad thing since i tend to order hotter than I can handle, but I've grown accustomed to being asked. The noodles were overcooked and bland... I'd recommend sticking to a restaurant that specializes in one cuisine, not multiple (Thai, Cambodian, Chinese) Sorry, folks."}
{"text":"I love the spring rolls and salads. Haven't tried to much else yet, but will be returning."}
