{"text":"This place is awesome.....food is amazing. The sauce is to die for. The fries are so good and the service is amazing as well. Please go try for yourself. I love this place."}
{"text":"I waited for 20 minutes and still no food. I am disappointed in this location. It's suppose to be fast food not a restaurant. They aren't even busy!"}
{"text":"I love raising canes there chicken fingers & sweet tea are delicious & I was so happy when they were building this location because it is only about 5-10 minutes away from my house but the past 5 times I have come they have messed up my order! Get it together Canes!"}
{"text":"Fast service, very clean establishment, and great food. The 4 piece chicken basket was more than enough food for one person. You get chicken strips( super tasty), coleslaw, texas toast and a pile of fries. You can tell the food is made to order, it's hot and fresh. The dipping sauce is to die for. I even used it for my fries. Loved the sweet tea! Price was pretty decent too."}
{"text":"This place puts Wing Stop to shame. They may only have one flavor, but it is the flavor of AWESOME! I make sure to stop here every time I am in Vegas. Absolutely worth the short drive south of the strip. Please open one in So Cal."}
{"text":"There is a lot of hype about this place! It was pretty good but I'm from Cali so I compared it to Chik-Fil-A which I personally like better. I got the Caniac Combo! Overall, it was good. They're also known for their sauce which I wasn't a huge fan of but everyone seems to love it. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Tasty , economoical , clean , simple. The bread on the side is pretty good with their specialty sauce."}
{"text":"I love this place so much that I've once taken a road trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas for their chicken fingers. Okay, so I ended up booking a room in town and decided I didn't want to drive back, but I did intend on going home originally.  Been to a couple of the Cane's locations on multiple occasions and they've all been consistent in quality of food and service. Chicken fingers are breaded nicely, the sauce is not overpowering, the sweet tea is good, and they serve crinkle fries - I love crinkle fries!  When you're ordering to dine in, they call out your name and deliver the food to you. There was one occasion where the lady just sorta stopped moving towards me and just waited for me to reach her for the handoff across the seating area.. But I suppose it gets tiring to walk across the restaurant every few minutes so I don't really blame her."}
{"text":"Chicken and fries were delicious, I substituted the Cole slaw for extra fries. Sauce is a must with the chicken and sweet tea as well. The bathroom was well kept and service was grade A+ even tho we came in about 30 minutes before closing. Location is great and will be definitely coming back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Manager Chris was very helpful when it came to my experience at this Location. They were having some issues with their system but he handled it very promptly!"}
{"text":"Ryan B is the homie! Always good looks on da chicken. Holla at your boy if you want your chicken. Done right!"}
{"text":"Chicken is super dry and fries extra salty every time. I've tried to give this store plenty of chances but always regret it. Never again I'll drive down to the further one for actual quality !!"}
{"text":"They have one of the simplest menus I've ever seen.  Basically you can order chicken tenders or chicken tenders or more chicken tenders.  Even the chicken sandwich is made from chicken tenders.  With that said, the tenders are above average and the fries are average.  The star of the show is the garlic bread.  It is downright delicious.  It is fluffy with a perfect outer crust and the right amount of seasoning.  Sure, it's really only Texas toast, but it's the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"First off, i think there are only two things i think cane's should better, One is to clarify itself better. It seems alot of people are confused/disappointed that the menu is small. Think of cane's as less of a restaurant and more of a chicken finger stand.  Second thing is my one complaint, the fries can easily become soggy. I always get it to go and they put it in a styrofoam container. Then they put it in a plastic bag. They are on the soft side of fries to start with, but that combination traps all of the moisture and just makes them some of the worst fries. I always take the box out of the bag and pop the lid. Not really a solution if you're driving too far as they'll be cold quick, but works for me.   The other comment i saw that i have to comment on, is that you can get chicken fingers anywhere. Good luck with that, because i have tried. Getting older and \"trying\" to eat healthier, i kicked red meat down to two days a week, but i'm a man, therefore i must have meat.... or else. So, I have gotten chicken tenders from just about every fast food joint in town and only a few places stand up to theirs.  Also, the cane's sauce is good, but i eat mine with Stubbs Sweet Heat BBQ sauce and some Sriracha."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is delicious. The dipping sauce for the chicken is so good. Great portions for the price."}
{"text":"food is good , but it is dirty and a bunch of kids work there and they are very disorganized and unprofessional."}
{"text":"growing up with canes in the south, it definately takes me back to eat here.  unlike some other posters, canes chicken fingers ARE the best i have ever eaten, but they are really only a vehicle for consuming the Canes sauce!  the sweet tea is also AMAZING!  i dont live in vegas, so as im leaving, i always get a jug for the road out!  a limited menu (in this case) means one thing-  you dont really need much else!  on a trip to las vegas filled with $150 per person dinners-  canes is usually the first place we hit upon arrival!"}
{"text":"Crispy chicken. Always good for the soul. Chicken and fries are amazing. I loved it. I feel like I'm more country than where I come from. I love sweet tea and it's my favorite drink. Nice atmosphere and seems like a great place to go with friends and family."}
{"text":"Sauce is boss and best chicken. Chick fil a is second place. Chicken always tastes fresh and the sweet tea is delicious(i mix half sweet and half unsweet). The staff is friendlier than all other fast foods, they come and take your tray, ask if you need condiments or refills too."}
{"text":"The food here was superb as always, but the service I received today...not so much.  The cashier wasn't at the register, she was around the corner doing something else.  Understandable, since this was right before the lunch rush started and there were probably other things she had to do.  Finally the kitchen staff had to tell her she had two customers waiting, so she came over to the register and then just STARED AT ME.  No \"Hi, can I help you?\" or \"Thanks for waiting.\"  To top it off, she even flashed me one of those \"what are you waiting for\" looks.  I've had better ordering experiences at vending machines.  I hope that she was just having a bad day, because I've been there several times and the employees have always been super friendly.  Still, this visit was a solid 4 stars because I love their chicken fingers, secret sauce and mini-crinkle cut fries, plus I'm not one of those cranks who gives a restaurant one star based on one little thing that went wrong."}
{"text":"I have a child so I've tasted a lot of chicken fingers all over the place.  I must say these are the best I've ever had anywhere! You can taste the freshness! I love the crinkle cut fries but the styrofoam to go container they put them in tends to make all the food soggy by the time I get home. LOVE the texas toast!! Yummy, love this place! I count myself lucky if there's only 4 or 5 people in the drive through!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the plump juicy fingers here! The dipping sauce makes my mouth water.  Yes the fries are not all that great, usually pretty soggy and limp but as Colleen mentioned, if you dip them into the sauce you'll forget about the fact that the fries are limp.  They honestly don't give you enough dipping sauce, I could drink it from the serving cup HA HA."}
{"text":"For a fast food place, this is 5 stars.  Excellent chicken fingers - juicy with a think breading.  Their Texas Toast is delicious too. Fries are average - but i am a sucker for a crinkle fry.   Service is always friendly and my order is right every time - which isn't always the case for fast food.  If you want delicious fast food this place is great."}
{"text":"Worst customer service, the workers are rude and too busy socializing with each other to get your order correct. Hate going to this place!"}
{"text":"Bland boring strips, bland soggy coleslaw. The only highlight in this meal was the Texas toast. I have been here once before and still no improvement. KFC has better chicken and coleslaw."}
{"text":"I love canes! Every time I get canes my food is always hot a fresh but this time my fries was so over fried and dark and super crispy and the chicken was not hot it was warm and not fresh. Very disappointed.. could of been maybe cause I came 30 mins before closing but still should be fresh"}
{"text":"\"Welcome to Cane's where the sauce is the boss...\"  Yes, yes it is! The sauce, fingers and toast are all stupid good. I typically get the box combo with no slaw and extra toast. Super filling but no regrets. If you haven't checked out Raising Cane's, you are missing out. Skip the burger/fries/coke routine and try this grub."}
{"text":"Went to Canes today and experienced a really bad situation.  I would assume cleaning tables and chairs would  be a policy.  We ordered our food and went to sit down towards a very dirty table and booth. I asked to have the table and booth cleaned and had a really rude young girl come over with a really bad attitude ask \" what's the problem \". OMG are you serious I am a firm believer that cleanliness is a priority especially when it comes to place of food. I am also a believer if you don't like your job then go somewhere else. This young lady obviously does not like her job. After complaining to the manager this still didn't make my visit pleasant."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's where, \"The chicken is kickin, the sauce is boss and the toast is the most!\" I got pretty excited when they opened this location so I didn't have to trek somewhere further away.   If you haven't been here before, think of it as the In N Out of chicken fingers. That's what I like about it, I already know what I'm going to get, chicken fingers!!   The staff are friendly, they actually look you in the eye AND they speak English!"}
{"text":"\"Lowering Cane's expectations\" should be the name.  They have just set the bar low on food quality and taste.  No seasoning at all in the breading of the chicken fingers and the fries seem like they came straight from your grocer's freezer.  Must not have thought much of their dog if this is their tribute to him.  Just drove away disappointed.  Want my junk food to taste good if I'm going to splurge with this type of caloric intake.  Only positive was stellar Drive-Thru service and the place seemed pretty clean.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I'm so happy they put one right near my house!! When you ask for extra crispy fries, they deliver! The chicken is always fresh and hot. The staff is also super friendly and i come here once every one to two weeks. I wish i could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"Our family loves some yummy Canes on occasion. This one star does not reflect the food today but the drive thru service. The guy giving the food in the window gave us 2 hot sauces and 3 ketchup packets for 3 caniacs no slaw extra fries. I asked for more and he rudely under his breath said of course you do. I proceeded to call and report him to the manager. She listened but her explanation came with laughter which I felt highly inappropriate. From now on we will take our patronage elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Service is good. Watch the overspray when they are cleaning tables around you. Just a little too happy with the spray bottle."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed. This place was the bomb diggity but for some reason the chicken quality has fallen off. Nearly every bite contains fat or gristle, the breading has gone soggy including the fries being undercooked.   Lack of care and lack of decent chicken quality makes this place fall out. This is no longer my Friday night deal. Also includes the quality of canes on vegas Blvd and warm springs area."}
{"text":"My first visit there by recommendation and it was amazing. The food was fresh. The tenders were huge and juicy!!  I will def go again....and get an extra sauce."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 1 star is because of the customer service. Every time my boyfriend and I eat at this specific location we get sick. It's not a sick feeling right away, it's in the morning when we wake up. It happens every time. We ate there last night and now I'm up throwing up chicken. Lovely right. Won't be returning to this location ever only the one on rainbow and on Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's on University: Best chicken fingers in the game Food/ pricing  You better like chicken fingers when coming to canes because that's pretty much all they serve. But when it comes to chicken fingers, they definitely know what they are doing. The menu consists of 3, 4, or 6 chicken finger combos with Texas toast, coleslaw and French fries. The only other item on the menu is the sandwich combo with 3 fingers. Every time I go to Canes, I order the the 4-piece box combo. The box combo is served in a Styrofoam box with easy to-go take out opportunity. The chicken fingers have a southern seasoning with just the right amount of breading. Also, their lemonade is outstanding. The averagely salty French fries and creamy coleslaw are whatever, but the Texas toast is out of this world. People dislike the French fries in other yelp reviews but I find them to be salty and tasty. The 4-piece combo will run you about $8. For the value there is nowhere better to go. But as for the limited menu, healthier options like a side salad would be happily welcomed. Note* coleslaw may be substituted for an extra Texas toast. (not known by many people)   Atmosphere  Cane's atmosphere is all about Arizona State University. the restaurant is decorated with ASU logos and \"Go Devils\" throughout the store. With plenty of seating, I never find myself waiting for a table. The drink machines are self serve besides the lemonade which requires a cost to refill. The regular chairs and tables are comfortable for a nice sit down meal. All of the surfaces are clean and sanitary. Male and female bathrooms are present and always clean. Cane's employees are always wiping down tables and other surfaces customers regally touch to ensure regular cleanliness.  Service Cane's service is on point. Once you order and sit down at a table of your own choice, your meal is delivered to you personally. The server calls your name and the food is brought to you. The server always asks if you need anything like ketchup, which is always a nice touch. As a regular customer I am never disappointed by the service. The restaurant sits on one of ASU's busiest corners so I never find myself disappointed waiting a few extra minutes for food. Lunch and dinner time are usually packed with people trying to get their chicken fingers. Also, late nights after 11 are also super busy because of college students. The drive through line is super convenient but usually takes much longer than getting out and waiting in line. If there are less than 10 cars waiting in the drive though lane, I'll usually go inside. If you are looking to eat some great chicken fingers and Texas toast around the ASU school area, Raising Cane's should be your go to! All in all, Cane's is one of Arizona States student's favorite restaurants and everyone should go check it out."}
{"text":"This place is way over-hyped. It was like hearing how \"Citizen Kane\" is the best movie ever made and then watching it. Sure you think its great but you wish you could have formed your opinion.   Raising Cane's was ok. The tenders were served piping hot; however, the fries are not very good. The iced-tea was SWEET, like I needed an insulin shot afterward. I couldn't stop thinking about those \"diabeetus\" commercials with Wilford Brimley. I ended up having to wash the tea down with Sprite. Yes, you read that correctly.  Giant plus: the servers were hilarious/kind and gave us a good ribbing for being out-of-towners. I would go back just for that."}
{"text":"Delicious, juicy and tasty chicken. Very simple menu but they do it well. It's like the In-N-Out of fried chicken. The texas toast is awesome and that sauce, whatever it is. nommmmm. Would go back a whole bunch if I wanted to be the fattest person on earth."}
{"text":"When it comes to fast food Canes is a great spot.  Fresh chicken fingers, crinkle cut fries, fresh coleslaw, Texas toast and secret sauce.  That is what you can expect every time you come here.  I love it, my wife loves it and most importantly my kids love it.  The hardest decision you will face when your their is wether to choose the sweat tea or lemonade."}
{"text":"They have good food. But they're drive through line takes FOREVER. I literally waited in the drive through with only 1 person in front of me for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I have an addiction to chicken fingers. I eat them at every chance I get. So my husband searched online and found Raising Cane's. To our great interest, we learned about this location.  On a vacation last week to Sedona, AZ, we stopped here -- twice. First on the way to Sedona from the airport and again on the way home.  The chicken was superb -- nice breading and not overly heavy so the emphasis was really on the chicken. I just got fingers. My hubby got a box meal with fries, Texas Toast and sauce, all of which was excellent, too. And quite filling! There was no need for more food after our initial order, unless it was to take it with us..  But what really stood out for me, was the staff. The young woman who took our order, Falicia, was as friendly as could be and highly competent, going out of her way to help us with directions to the Desert Botanical Garden, where we were headed after our meal.  Now, consider how many customers she served in the week we spent in Sedona. When we returned yesterday, she was there again and when she saw us, the first thing she said was, \"How was the garden?\" For real? We're THAT important that you remember helping us? Clearly, Raising Cane's -- or this location, anyway -- puts a premium on customer service. I have a zero-tolerance policy for poor customer service, so you can imagine how THRILLED and impressed I was. It felt like this young woman was an old friend and what a warm feeling.  Her colleague at the counter, Liz, was also adorable and delightful, joking around with us, while getting our order EXACTLY right.  And while we were eating, the manager came around to each table stopping to talk with patrons to ensure that everything was copacetic. I just can't say enough good things about the service at this facility.  Delicious food and outstanding service. A five-star rating on Yelp is a designation of, \"As good as it gets\" and this Raising Cane's restaurant richly deserves the designation. It's 1200+ miles away, but I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Chicken is lean and fried just right and the special sauce is to die 4. My mouth is watering just thinking about the sauce. And the Texas toast is toasted to perfection."}
{"text":"\"Cluck Cluck Chicken Chicken What Meal You Be Picken\". that's what you can expect to hear pulling through the drive through.  I always go with the box combo, 4 fingers plus fries and coleslaw with a jumbo slice of Texas toast and their secret sauce.  Sweet tea is a must for my wife but I have also been told the lemonade is outstanding.  Great spot for a fast food meal sure to please your taste buds every time"}
{"text":"I love Raising Cane's dipping sauce and their bread french fries are great chicken so tender what are the best chicken fingers I've had gotta love their homemade sweet tea"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much when I got there, I didn't even know they had chicken fingers or anything. First thought when I pulled up was \"wow these prices are expensive\" I didn't know places had huge serving sizes for fast food joints. But I ended up order the 3 chicken fingers. Pretty good, better then your average. Overall it was good I'd go back not specifically for the food.   Anyone visiting in the Arizona area should try this once. But you might get addicted. Peace!"}
{"text":"Go here all the time but last visit will probably be my last as I ordered a box combo and was missing a finger and one of my other pieces was no bigger than a French fry and they wouldn't do anything about it. I basically had 2 pieces In a box"}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars only because I'm in love with Raising Cane's Box combos and their amazing sauce. Sadly the service here is lower then sub-par. The fat brunette cashier is beyond rude the past four time I've gone in and ordered food. All 4 times she's had a bad attitude, She rolls her eyes at me multiple times. Rushes me and my order and has flung my cup at me with utter disrespect to shoo me through the line. Quite frustrating to get such terrible service at a place where the food is so good...  other then the service. The food is always hot. The dining area is always full of ASU kids but is usually respectablely clean. Good place to get a good quick meal."}
{"text":"Simple, quick, and delicious. Cole slaw and sweet tea are really good. Fries and chicken tenders are simple."}
{"text":"When this place first opened years ago I was a bit excited by the concept: chicken fingers, fries, doesn't get easier than that right? Or any harder. Sadly I can not get behind this place with the enthusiasm so many others have.   Ordering is easy, you just have to decide how many fingers you want in your meal. Few side offerings make for easy choosing. That's a plus in my book.   As for the fingers, what this place is built upon....yes, they are quite large. Plump, juicy, fingers with a nice breading. To look at them you'd think you're about to bite into something full of flavor & spice. Unfortunately this is not the case. I found them to be quite bland.   Now the sauce. I am not a sauce person. I firmly believe the meat, whether it chicken, beef, or fish, should be seasoned properly so it stands on its own. Yeah, sauces can be fun, I get it, but they should not be relied upon as an afterthought to season your meal. And thats what this place does. Bland fingers relying upon a sauce to give it the flavor it deserves. Not ok in my book.   BUT...this might be your thing. If you like bland chicken & dipping sauces this is definitely your place.  It's not mine. I'll stick with Carl's Jr where the fingers can stand on their (figuratively speaking) without a sauce."}
{"text":"This was the first Canes i ate at and i got the food to go and was just slightly impressed. I have since eaten at other locations and ate in the dinning room and the food was definitely better for the dine-in"}
{"text":"I decided to stop by to grab a bite but especially because i was Super Hot and wanted their half Sweet Tea/ Lemonade drink! Well.. I was super disappointed because i drove off and went to get a sip of my drink it tasted like if it was watered down with faucet water. I dont know if they dont use filtered water for their ice or what it could have been but it was disgusting. I asked for extra toast instead of coleslaw but when i opened my box it had coleslaw and barely any fries.  I was very dissatisfied with my order and the girl at the drive thru was not very pleasant either. Ive never experienced this lack of service at other locations!"}
{"text":"People out of their minds giving bad reviews to this place. Canes is awesome, best fast food you can get for the buck, went here a few weeks back late and everything was clean and tasted great. Drown out the noise."}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited this location last weekend after a baseball game. We were greeted by a super nice employee in line in the drive thru that chatted with us about hating the Cubs lol and gave us free samples of the lemonade (amazing by the way!). Anyway, went home and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner then after the game the next day we decided to go back because we were so impressed with the food and service!! Saw the same gentleman in the drive thru again, made fun of us again lol, He gave us a card that we promptly lost so don't know his name but he is the Asst. Manager. Kudos to you sir for the amazing customer service! I hope your company appreciates you! You have won us over for sure! We will most def be back :)"}
{"text":"Chicken is good, fries were better. Would have liked to have some ranch but they only allow you their own sauce. Bread was not seasoned, was bland."}
{"text":"I seriously NEVER get tired of raising canes chicken & the sauce is amazing! Recommend completely."}
{"text":"Work Near this Canes go hear for Lunch on Fridays best Chicken Sandwich. Very clean and the staff is Great fast Service."}
{"text":"The chicken,fries, and toast is good but when I ordered, one of the crew members denied my caniac cars so I can't get points on my card. They need better crew members"}
{"text":"About 3 bad experiences out of about 60 visits. No coronary issues yet, but then I do get the coleslaw and pass on the texas toast, its seems to be the only part of a combo that causes any indigestion issues. Might have something to do with plastifiers or something, cause everything else seems to be mighty fresh. Makes you wonder how there is any business for Kinda Flavorless Chickens in the nearby vicinity but I guess the power of coupons holds a significant influence over the weak willed and of impacted taste buds."}
{"text":"Cane's would get a 5 star if they could keep the quality control to standard.  At best, the chicken is perfectly brined, with a breading so perfect you could call it tempura. It will slide off the chicken if you let it. Chicken is perfectly tender. The fries are have a crisp outside and a soft, delicious inside. The toast is beautiful, buttery, and garlicky.  At worst, and definitely more common, the chicken will be overcooked. The breading will infuse into the chicken and basically create an hard, inedible rock. Frequently only 40% of the finger will even be edible. The fries will be a soggy mess. The toast will have been pressed into the styrofoam lid and there will be melted styrofoam on it.   If you ask for the chicken to be remade and explain what is wrong, they will always look at you like you're insane, and will end up giving you another plate of garbage. If you say you want your money back they won't give it to you. Instead they'll try to give you a gift card.  Lastly, I have to mention how corny the music and decor of Cane's is. A bunch of movie posters are on the wall that all suck, and the music is frequently stuff that is even bad for radio music. They make the workers dress like a pre-diabetes Texan. Expect to see a Ferris Bueler poster, probably a Twilight poster, some Harry Potter action and then the Hangover. Expect to hear some weird ass Britney Spears music you'd hoped you would forget.  TL;DR: If the quality control could stay up, they would get a 5/5, regardless of the music and decor."}
{"text":"There is no reason not to love this place. The prices are inexpensive and they are opened past midnight. Li love the bread and the sauce!"}
{"text":"Drive through clerk spoke fast when I apologized that I couldn't understand and asked her to repeat what she said she rudly talked really slow. You'll get better service if you order inside."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Cheap and tasty. The fries and sweet tea is amazing!! Chicken strips are very crispy. It's nothing fancy. You get your money's worth. I have always ordered in or take out so I cannot comment on the ambience or the service. But good is good!"}
{"text":"Fast service, friendly at the drive thru, haven't had the food in a long time but it was good will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Ate here two days in a row. When ever I'm in for some guilty pleasures of some delicious chicken fingers, I go here. I have to do some extra running but well worth it. ^^"}
{"text":"Always tastes so fresh. They get your food out in pretty good time. They're always super busy but are fast considering. I tried the Bush's chicken place right by it and it just isn't as good and fresh."}
{"text":"I love this place staff is friendly though sometimes it is annoying when you get asked hows your food five times but other then that I love the food it's awesome"}
{"text":"This is a franchise, but who cares when it's so good! The chicken is absolutely awesome and the sauce they give you is the best sauce I have ever had. The fries and chicken go really well with the sauce. As if fries and chicken weren't enough, they give you amazing garlic bread to go with it.   This place is one of the best franchises around."}
{"text":"Service with a smile the finger hot and crispy. The place is clean and they have a lot of Raiders pictures."}
{"text":"The Rock Springs location is the most inconsistent Cane's I've been to. Sometimes the food is fresh, other times the chicken strips are dried out and look like they've been sitting around for hours.  Drive thru generally moves along quickly regardless of how long it is. Unfortunately I live closest to this location otherwise I would go to the Centennial Center Cane's, which consistently serves fresh food every time I've been there."}
{"text":"Best chicken, fries, lemonade and sauce  for fast food in Vegas. They're friendly and efficient and the food is always great!"}
{"text":"I've eaten canes before in Midwest. I loved it there and I loved it here. Everyone should stop by at least once to try the freshly made chicken as you order it."}
{"text":"Excellent fingers.  Management was very generous.  Hand batter chicken and delicious.  Come to St George UT with this please."}
{"text":"Best fast food style chicken. They use the best ingredients and there chicken is high quality and cooked perfectly so it melts in your mouth. And amazing sauce."}
{"text":"This has some amazing chicken and sauce! My only complaint is that when you take food to go its soggy by the time you get home because of the restaurant using styrofoam to go containers! They need to get boxes like KFC and places like that have so the chicken and fries are crispy! Other than that. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken strips are fresh, juicy and overall good.  I didn't care for the fries, they remind me of the bags of frozen fries you buy in the freezer isle at any grocery store.  The sauce is decent, I didn't even ask if they had alternatives such as ranch, I really hope so for next time.  The sweet tea was good but I feel like it's hard to mess that up anyway.  I think Raising Cane's needs more variety as they are just a bit too simple."}
{"text":"Always good and awesome staff!! It just went up a while ago and it's brought a new level of chicken to this area, nice"}
{"text":"Food is great! Only thing I don't like is their weird song and dance they do about your order. Glad they're down to earth, but I don't need you to rap my order me! Dont get me wrong, dude had some skill, but a restaurant isnt the place, just take my money and let me go already. I highly suggest getting extra crispy fries and chicken, its the bomb!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness..... My husband and I have been here about 8 times in the last 10 days. We are chicken lovers. The food is very natural, seasoned well, and filling. Eric is the manager and he treats customers very well. We have officially kicked Wing Stop to the curb. This is a good date night spot for 15.54 for two box meals,can't beat that at all. The sauce for chicken is very tasty and wouldn't believe how it's a great match with the meal. Let alone Texas Toast, we are bread lovers as well but the buttery taste bread tops off the meal with Sweet Tea."}
{"text":"My daughter was harassing me to go here since we moved to Tempe. I was skeptical of a place that was strictly chicken tenders. But I was blown away by the tenderness of the tender...lol. I like that they substitute the coleslaw for more fries or bread. Homemade lemonade was decent. Four 4 piece tender meals for $30 not bad. Everyone was full and satisfied...even had leftovers. Good lunch tomorrow"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!    The quality of the chicken is excellent.  If you haven't been here before, you also need to know you can ask for extra toast instead of fries or coleslaw and you must get the canes sauce.    I would give the service and cleanliness five stars too.  We have been to the drive through as well as inside to sit down.  The staff could not be more attentive or polite.  It would be rare to find another fast casual style restaurant that is as clean with as great a staff as this particular Canes.    Not sure how they find their employees, but somehow they all seem to be intelligent and respectful.  On a busy afternoon, we received the wrong order once, they were sincerely apologetic, they corrected the problem quickly, and they were eager to make sure we had everything else we needed the rest of the time.  You can't ask for more than that in any restaurant."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff with quick service. Family friendly atmosphere; I was there with my two girls.  Odd combo of chicken fingers and texas toast. Fries were good. Chicken is a bit too deep fried for my liking; the chicken taste is masked by the \"fried\" taste. Overall a nice alternative to a burger joint."}
{"text":"I came by for a late night snack on 4/18/2017 around 11 pm, there was a few cars in front of me in the drivethru. The wait wasn't very long, I order The Craniac and a Kid's Meal. Paid, got my food and went about my way. This is one my 17 year old daughter's favorite places to eat out, I even got her a gift card for Easter. Anyways, my daughter and 3 year old twins shared the food, one twin eating more than the other. I had my daughter set 2 strips and some fries to the side for my other son, as he wanted to take some for his school lunch the following day. They ate, all was fine until about 3 am. My daughter came running from her room into the restroom, she slammed the door shut, thats what woke me. I asked what was wrong and she told me her stomach was hurting and she felt like vomiting. She was probably in the restroom for 10 minutes when one of my twins started groaning, moaning, toss and turning, and kicking. Then shortly the other twin. I asked them what was wrong as the kept doing this and they said their tummy hurt. This went on for a while, finally one twin was back to sleep but the other who had ate more of the food was still awake and obviously in a great deal of pain. My daughter spent about 20-30 minutes in the restroom and then went to her room to try and get some rest with the light on a trash can next to her bed. At about 4:30 am my 3 yr old said his tummy hurt really bad again and said he needed to go to the restroom, rushed him over there in time for him to reach the toilet, as he proceeded to vomit. This went on for about 5 minutes. I took him back to bed and about 15 minutes later we were back to the restroom as he continued to vomit. I was up until about 7 am with my baby before he finally fell asleep again. No one else ate any of the food from Cane's other than my daughter and twin sons, and no one else was ill. I advised my 8 year old before I went back to bed not to take the rest of the food to school because it had made his sister and brothers sick. $15 for a night of watching helplessly as my kids tossed and turned in gut wrenching pain was not worth it!! I called the location this afternoon and the manager I spoke with over the phone didn't seem at all concerned, other than to say that they are glad to hear from customer feedback. Didn't offer an apology, and it wasn't until I mentioned what their protocol was for calls/instances like this that he asked what he could do? He didn't offer to reimburse my money. I am definitely not considering free food after what I just watched my kids go through, either way he didn't offer that either. I'm not sure that this will be a favorites of my daughters anymore after this horrible experience. You can guarantee that I wont be buying anything from Cane's in the near future. NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"If a fast food joint has only four items on the menu then those items should be exemplary food items in every way.  Cane's fails to reach even basic standards of interesting food.  Chicken fingers, french fries, Cole slaw and Texas toast are all that's available.  Like Cane's competitors, one meal variant is to order chicken fingers on a bun, but unlike competitors there is no option for a salad with chopped chicken on the menu.  The most complimentary adjective that can be used to describe the food offered at Cane's is bland.    The primary offering, around which all meals are based and the business is built, are chicken fingers.  While the fingers are fresh and hot, that's about all that can be said for them.  They meet the criteria to qualify as chicken fingers but Cane's does nothing to make them interesting or appealing.  The fingers are a bit undersized, and quite a bit smaller than those that can be found at similar chains elsewhere.  The breading is crisp and not too greasy, but bland, flavorless and without any spices at all.  These are the first chicken fingers that I felt that I had to salt to enjoy.  They are served with \"Cane's sauce,\" which is so prized that they charge extra if a customer wants more than one small dipping cup's worth.  Sadly, the sauce tastes like a poor attempt to copy the dipping sauce from Zaxby's, and Cane's only avoids a recipe trademark lawsuit by making the sauce with more oil and corn syrup and less spice.    Despite the nearby billboard's claim that Cane's fries are fresh, the fries that I ate looked, felt and tasted like they came from a bag.  Unlike most chicken finger places which sprinkle a seasoning blend over their fries, the fries at Cane's were served without any seasoning, not even salt.  While crisp and not overly oily, the fries were as bland and uninteresting as the chicken.    Much like the chicken and fries, the Texas toast is offered up after performing the least amount of effort for a food item to qualify as Texas toast.  It is a thick slice of white bread that has been briefly toasted (not grilled) and then spread with something that is close enough to butter to be acceptable.  It has none of the charm of true Texas toast and lacks the crisp, grilled exterior and herb butter blends that makes Texas toast a favorite menu item in so many places.  Instead of tossing this chunk of bland carbohydrates on top of a plate already piled of bland carbohydrates, I'd recommend asking to swap the toast for the coleslaw.    It's not that the coleslaw is anything spectacular, once again Cane's does the bare minimum for the foodstuff to qualify as the listed menu item, but after eating a bunch of bland fries and chicken the coleslaw will seem exciting.  The 'slaw is little more than chopped cabbage and carrots (I couldn't taste any onion) tossed with some dressing, salt and pepper; but since everything else was served without any spices at all, the salt and pepper livens up an otherwise tasteless meal.    Overall, Cane's seems like little more than a knock-off version of the much better chicken strip joints of the south, most notably Zaxby's, right down to the movie posters and old signs on the walls.  The food is bland, uninteresting and overpriced.  Ten dollars is far too much to pay for undersized, bland chicken fingers, frozen fries and tasteless toast.  If you're in the area and want some chicken there are better options just up the road where you can get far more flavor and many more choices for much less money."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat chicken fingers at is definitely this place. I love it so much and always good service and nice people. The bread always warm and just so soft. The sauce that comes along with it just makes everything taste so much better. I always recommend everyone to try Canes. ONE LOVE"}
{"text":"Juicy, crispy, and deep fried chicken tenders. What's not to like? Love them, and plus they give military discount! BONUS!"}
{"text":"I usually order their three piece chicken with fries. I get extra sauce instead of the Texas toast. The sauce is out of this world. I love to dip my chicken & my fries in the sauce. I have only been through the drive thru, but so far I have received great customer service so far from their employee. I do not eat a lot of chicken, but I enjoy Canes chicken.  When I get a craving for chicken, I find myself stopping by Canes."}
{"text":"My expectations were high for Raising Cane's after a friend raved about the place. So maybe my review is a little harsh after the let down I recently experienced here. But all things considered, I don't plan on coming back to Cane's any time soon.  Atmosphere: it looks like they sent a 15 year old into Walmart and told them to go crazy. They have wood walls, steel chairs, and a disco ball. Movie posters from classics like \"The Hangover II\" hung up in one corner and fine art in the other. 1/5 stars  Wait staff: I guess the cashier was still in training because the manager was giving her a quick run through. The only problem was he came up to her right as I was coming up to order. They then l proceeded to ignore me for two minutes to finish their talk. After we ordered, the food took about 15 minutes to come out. So slow for fried chicken and fries!  Food: the chicken was good, but who messes up fried chicken. I got the 3 peice combo and I was a bit dissapointdissapointed in the proportions. I paid $7 for three chicken strips that were gone in two bites. These guys were tiny so if you are hungry expect to shell out at least $10 to fill up."}
{"text":"Totally love this place!! The chicken fingers are the best you could ever have. Chicken Fingers juicy done to perfection! Canes sauce is a must on them..and their crinkled fries yummo!!! Texas Toast fluffy yet crisp! Their lemonade and ice tea is a refresher... Las Vegas is super lucky to have Raising Canes!!!  If you are from out of town...I suggest that you stop by and have ya sum Raising Canes!"}
{"text":"Eat here at least once a week ,best chicken fingers around! Always fresh, and with fresh hot fries too. The lemonade tastes amazing as well.  The only thing that would make it better is if it had cheaper ala carte tenders, and more sauce selections than just one.  yum"}
{"text":"I really don't understand what the big deal is about this place. Chicken fingers? It's basically glorified truck stop food. As if fried chicken and fries aren't bad enough, you can also get some buttered white bread with your order- guaranteed to put you asleep in the afternoon if you go for lunch. Don't get the iced tea- 10 cups of sugar per gallon is probably their mixing ratio. Barf!!!!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for when you're talking about Raising Cane's.  It is what it is; they are who we thought they were, haha....  But when you get down to the brass tax, it's fried chicken fingers that we keep coming back for ladies and gentleman.  They do it well and often and I for one will keep coming back.    There is of course the people who say, \"That's all they have?\".  And I usually reply with \"yes, but they do it Oh so Well!\".  So try the chickend fingers my friends and know that it is the one thing that they do, and they are not ashamed of that fact!"}
{"text":"You gotta love fried chicken!!! And the strips from Canes are amazing!  You could call it Amazing Canes!  Haha...  OK, so all they have for meat is chicken fingers and they do it oh, so well.  They also have great cole-slaw, Texas toast, crincle cut fries and there special sauce.  And if your a lover of sweet tea they have that as well.  So the menu is not extensive but what they do have they do very well!!! If you want a new chicken experience and haven't tried Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers I suggest that you do! It's the place where the toast is the most and the sauce is the boss!"}
{"text":"I've been to this canes many times. Of course the sauce is the boss and the slaw is the law. But should the hair be there? I've found small hairs in the bottom of my caniac a few times before. Not a big deal seeing as how I already finished eating. But when your 2 fingers in on a delicious caniac and you take a bite and look at the chicken that you took a bite off of and see an inch and a half, curly, black, shiny hair wrapped around the remains of your chicken finger, you get a little disgusted. It seems as if someone took the time to do the tedious job of wrapping the hair around the chicken finger. They might as well have tied a bow in it to make it look pretty. When I brought my caniac to the counter, I said can I have a new caniac, this one has a big hair in it. (I was showing somewhat of a grin like it was a funny coincidence or a fluke) the employees just looked at me for about 5 seconds without responding so I said \"thank you\" and walked back to my seat and left my meal on the counter. I'm not the rude type but when I get stared at like I'm retarded for not eating some curly pube on my chicken finger I get a little aggravated. The manager was nice enough to walk my new caniac to my table and apologized for the inconvenience. I found that the manager handled the situation correctly but the employees did not, seeing as how i got stared down for not gorging on their delicious pubes. If you expect a little extra with your meal, then I suggest this raising canes. It's an unwritten rule that every other customer gets a free strand of black floss in their meal. lost the love for my canes..."}
{"text":"I gotta be honest when I heard they didn't offer ranch in a place that serves chicken I was a little upset, I mean ranch and chicken go hand in hand. Boy was I in for a pleasant surprise the house sauce is amazing and the chicken is cooked perfectly. Definitely a returning customer."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's has been a favorite eating place of mine since I have been able to drive.   It has a humble menu, but delivers very well on what it offers. Cane's delivers exactly what is promises: high quality chicken with tasty sides. Not to mention their famous sweet tea, but be sure to fill your cup with ice because their tea will melt it quickly. Every time the chicken comes out hot and tasting fresh. Their crinkle-cut fries never disappoint and their cole slaw is delicious if you ever want a slightly healthier option. Their texas toast is perfectly buttered and toasted every time. On top of all of this, Cane's always gives very generous portions. They also   Cane's delivers both quality and quantity. Not only that, but for a good price too. Every entrée on the menu runs under ten dollars. In my opinion you get far more than what you pay for. Even if they decided to charge an extra couple dollars, I wouldn't mind. They are also very flexible and don't charge for any side substitutions. You don't even have to be under twelve to get a kid's meal! Definitely a good affordable option for a college student like myself. Cane's honestly provides fried chicken better and cheaper than most dining restaraunts.  Now let's talk about Cane's atmosphere. For a full Cane's experience, you must eat in. There is always a cool retro vibe, with old school movie posters and a disco ball overhead. It is very family friendly, and they always play clean music with a positive vibe. It is very relaxed and easygoing, perfectly complimenting its style of food and service. You are free to arrange tables however you wish and make yourself at home while you are there. A perfect place for a small family or a group of friends looking for a quick, cheap, and tasty meal.  Cane's service is spectacular and consistent. They really go out of their way to make you feel special every time. They always greet with a smile, address you by name, and are happy to answer any questions you have. You can count on them to clear your table once you are finished, and they will never let you sit down at a dirty table. Not to mention the speed of Cane's service. Even when the restaurant is packed, you will never wait more than ten minutes for your food. The staff remains very patient and will attend to you if you simply raise your hand. Their drive-thru experience is just as exemplary as its eat-in. They always talk with courtesy and respect, they waste no time to give you what you order, and go the extra mile to make sure you are happy. Just watch out when you go during busy hours! The line can get very backed up and parking is usually packed. I personally think it is worth the wait, but your discretion is warranted!  All in all, if you like fried chicken, Cane's is the place for you. Just be aware that chicken is their specialty and if you go expecting much more, you might disappoint yourself."}
{"text":"If El Pollo Locos chicken is good, this is way up there! Smooth to the throat, and tastier! Must say, one if the best fast food chicken I've eaten!"}
{"text":"I was hoping this would great but they were not! The chicken was decent but the proportions were small, especially compared to the pictures on the menu. The chicken was a little greasy but I could live with that if everything else was good. Also, their signature sauce was bland, I switched to their only other choice, honey mustard. All in all not worth the effort.  Too expensive for too little. Go to Shanes Shack instead."}
{"text":"The first few times I've driven past Cane's I had thought it said \"Curves\" from the corners of my eyes. Whoops.  This chain of chicken cookers is constantly crowded round the clock. I've been to this location a few times and they are consistent with these: very friendly service (your order is considered '1 love', manager checks up on you), very tasty chicken fingers, interesting crowd, and sadly one or two fingers are always tiny 'pinky fingers'. The fries are average, the coleslaw is bleh, the Texas toast is nice, and the drinks have free refills.  Very fast paced, fast food atmosphere. Especially during the school semesters. The air is a mix of deep fried goodness and ammonia from the table cleaning. Turnover of customers during lunch is kind of frenetic. There are movie posters (Goonies!) all along the walls."}
{"text":"What can I say.. I grew up working for KFC in my teenage years, dined on Church's and Pioneer Chicken (sorry, I'm reminiscing) and enjoy the crunch of Popeye's so I had a few fast food chicken in my life. My nephew told me to try out Cane's since he knew we were going to Vegas. I did and I loved it.  The menu is simple.. There are set numbers of meals... 3,4, 6 pieces of chicken tenders with fries, texas toast, coleslaw and a drink. Or if you have a lot to feed, they have their tailgate numbers.. 25, 50 or 100. No need to worry about spicy or regular, crispy or original or roasted or whatever else to confuse your hungry mind. They had it figured out that when a customer is hungry, the last thing they want to do is go through a gauntlet of choices. Sometimes, simple is best. The chicken was very good. Coating was crispy but not too thick. The chicken itself was moist, flavorful and not dry. The Cane sauce complimented the chicken well.. not spicy but a little tangy to not overpower the star, which is the chicken.   Overall.. my first time at Raising Cane's was good (at this location at least). Service was quick and friendly and the place was very clean. It is fast food but it's a good alternative to the others out there. Now if they can only come to the Bay Area..."}
{"text":"This is a must have every Vegas trip now. Got hooked after the first time I stumbled upon this place. This location does seem to get busier than the Flamingo location since it's in the outlet mall shopping center. Not your typical chicken fingers as they are fresh and not overly battered. Batter often flakes off since it is light and just enough. Fries are thinner crinkle cut and crispy. Service is normally excellent, though did have a bit of a wait when I ordered a jug of sweet tea once, but that was a rare exception. Always friendly employees. And if you like sweet tea, they have one of the best."}
{"text":"Amazing food, place was packed so you know the locals love it!  Generous amounts of good for a cheap price!  Great friendly staff, I would for sure recommend a stop here!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of east coast dining. Foods  here is very decent. I like their deluxe combo. It gives enough portion to be full.  This is family friendly restaurant. Because of the location, you will see many College students. If you don't like that atmosphere and prefer the quiet atmosphere I would reckoned different location. One in Gilbert, which opened recently is great for the family."}
{"text":"I have been to Tempe Raising Cane's, so nothing was surprising. But, this time I ordered 30 tailgate chickens. The chicken fingers here were crispy and much better quality than the other fast food chain. Also, the atmosphere was desirable for those who seek for the casual dining. I like the disco ball they put on the ceiling.   Although I went there around 10:30PM this place was busy with younger age people around 15-18 years old on Thursday night. I am not sure why they are eating this late... Anyway, I ended up waiting for 10 minutes until our foods comes in. I was impressed with their customer service. There were off duty employees lined up in front of me waiting for their food, but our ordered became the priority just like boarding on the airline as the first class passenger. Their customer service was excellent. However the ONLY REASON WHY I REDUCED ONE STAR  is because THEY FORGOT TO PUT THE FRENCH FRIES which was also my order. I found out about this later when I got to my house. Well, I understand that everyone makes mistake, so this time, I do not get that much upset at this since I liked their customer service."}
{"text":"The only good part about my 3 piece chicken strip meal was the toast.  Chicken had no flavor & was covered in oil.  Their french fries are identical to the ones you get at del taco. Was not pleased at all. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great cause their drive thru is open late. Chicken fingers are pretty good for it being a fast food joint. I like that they don't serve ranch and they have their own secret dipping sauce. I gave it a fourth star because the drive thru guy made me laugh as i was ordering for a car full of friends he quoted \"Dude where's my car?\" and said \"and then? oh no and then?\" and that made all of us laugh. Good quick meal to end a chill night out."}
{"text":"Went to this place this afternoon, not knowing any thing about it. It had people inside and cars in the parking lot so I decited to check it out. Simple menu made deciding what to eat easy. The service was quick and the food was brought to my table. The chicken fingers were good, however I think the fries left some thing to be desired.  Over all, not bad. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Goodness at your fingertips. Flavorful breading and awesome sauce will get me working out at the gym much more to keep the cholestrol down and continue to indulge in this fried goodness.  The sauce brings it all together. Its an aioli (fancy mayonaise) with a chili pepper kick to it.  Order extra sauces so you don't run out near the end due to dipping the fries and the buttery toasted bread in along with the chicken strips! Chicken strips! Just saying it makes me smile. Chicken Strips!"}
{"text":"I lived in the Deep South for years, where fried chicken and fries are treated as high gourmet. My Alabama hometown of just under 30,000 residents had SEVEN different fried chicken joints, and that didn't include restaurants that also had chicken on their menu. There were 2 of Southern-style chicken finger places--Guthrie's (which has been around for over 20 years) & Zaxby's, another chain down South. Raising Cane's fits that mold.  Southern style fingers are reknown for their crispiness as well as flavor. While the fingers I had at Cane's were thunderously crunchy and volcanically hot (temperature, not spicy), the flavor was not really there compared to the Cane's franchise I had in Augusta, Georgia. I didn't experience the down south flave I craved. Luckily, their sauce was on point. The sauce is a standard at these places--a mayo/ketchup blend with differing doses of black pepper, garlic powder, and worcester. Cane's sauce tasted like home.  Bottom line: Raising Cane's is a chain that tastes like what Southern Style chicken fingers should taste like. A \"Box\" (another recurring combo throughout the South) consists of 4 fingers, fries, cole slaw, 1 sauce, a regular drink and texas toast. I always order an extra sauce (1 ain't enough) and a sweet tea to complete the meal. The toast is to wipe up any excess sauce. Food is cheap (less than $8 for a combo) and service is fast. Make sure to eat it immediately, while the chicken is still hot enough to burn yer mouth. The coleslaw is used to cool down yer wounds."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter, and I can all split the Caniac combo and leave feeling satisfied. The food is always perfect, the environment is great, the establishment is clean, and the workers are so kind! I don't even want to admit how often we come here. I would absolutely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love love Cain's chicken!! Cain's employee Kristian was so helpful and friendly. She is a keeper and will go far! Thanks for the smile and great customer service!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, decent prices and good food. Order came out way faster than expect but was hot and fresh, very obviously not taken from under a heat lamp. Go for extra toast over coleslaw!"}
{"text":"Oh canes. I love canes. A lot. Let me point out that this location is always very busy however the staff does an excellent job of maintaining it. Love that the staff will wipe the tables down when someone leaves so the next guests don't have to sit in any messes. Very filling in my opinion. I always get an extra sauce. If you get the 4 piece(or anything that comes w the slaw) you can swap it out for extra fries or an extra sauce if you want. Huge game changer consider neither myself or any of my fam eat the slaw anyways lol. If you're looking for good American chicken strips and some yummy fries/toast/sauce CANES is your place. Random but they have the best ice too!"}
{"text":"Keeping this sweet and simple, this place is GREAT! Best chicken fingers around :)"}
{"text":"Love it! The only problem we have found with the Cane's on Las Vegas Blvd is it is hard to find a seat to eat inside ((always so busy)), otherwise everything else is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great quality food!! Love their canes sauce and sweet tea. If you love chicken fingers, this is the place to go. The menu is simple and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"This was the quickest drive though that I have had in some time (less than two minutes near midnight) and they still were able to maintain a very fresh fried taste and have everything piping hot.  Only thing that was a little cold were the crinkle fries, both overall quite impressive for the six chicken finger combo near closing time."}
{"text":"I rate this place with 3 stars just because they only have two different sauces. The chicken strips and the soft fresh bread was great."}
{"text":"Always saw a line at the drive thru so thought I'd give it a try. Have had their box meal (3 piece chicken, fries, Texas toast, and drink) several times. The chicken is very tender and the breading is very light. Some may not find it spicy or tasty enough but I felt it only made the natural flavor of the chicken stand out more. By comparison, Chick Fil A is more highly seasoned and too salty for my personal taste. The sauce is also delicious but again not too overpowering. The fries and the toast were ok but in my opinion nothing special. I wish they had a chicken only menu item. I tried the cole slaw and again nothing special for me.   Addressing previous criticisms of service and cleanliness of the indoor dining room I can only say that the 3 times I've been there in the last 7 weeks, once during a busy lunch rush, that the service I received was very friendly and attentive. Once I walked in while one employee was cleaning and they greeted me and immediately directed one of the counter persons to take my order without delay. The tables were clean and the fountain drink area was well kept. So I believe the management has heard and responded to the previous comments. I'll keep this updated because I definitely want to go back."}
{"text":"My kids love this place!!  Nothing beats Canes sauce!  Chicken is nice and Crispy,  love the coleslaw and fries!!!"}
{"text":"Bland Bland Chicken!! You would think if they specialize in chicken that it would be good, if not great. Not even close. The chicken had absolutely no flavor. The only thing that was good was the sweet tea & even that I've had better when I make it at home. If you have taste buds; DON'T EVEN BOTHER!!"}
{"text":"High quality chicken! I've been to this location many many times and every time j come the chicken is fresh and the toast and fries are too. And man do I love that sauce! I always get extra sauce so I can dip everything in it. The customer service is on point, they are always friendly and always bring the food to you. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The battered fried chicken fingers are tender and tasty. The texas toast is the best ever. The crinkle cut fries are ok. The sweet tea will wash all that down! I  would recommend this fast food joint!  P.S. the coleslaw sucks! (Yuck!)"}
{"text":"I love this place! Their food is do delicious and not too badly priced! The people who work there are always nice and friendly! Try this place and you won't be sorry! :)"}
{"text":"ckicken was ok but for being a ckicken finger only joint I feel that they need to have more condiments for dipping instead of their special sauce for being that chicken marinade for 24 hours it was no special flavor their toast was the best part of this meal"}
{"text":"Kind of an unusual place. I would've never thought to open a business sells chicken strips. Great ideal and great food. It's always a big hit when I buy everybody in my office lunch. Always very fresh and the sauces are amazing."}
{"text":"As far as fast food chicken goes, Raising Canes takes the cake. There chicken is juicy, succulent and finger lickin' good. Paired with their secret Canes sauce, coleslaw, crinkle cut fries, and a slice of garlic bread, you'll never leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken I've ever had and some great fries too! The star of the show is the Raising Canes sauce that is unlike anything I have ever had but definitely the best sauce I've tried too. The prices are all within adequate range of what you're buying.  Recommending this place to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Top 2 chicken places ive ever been too, the texas toast was perfectly toasted the cole slaw could have a little more milk in it be prepared to be uncomfortably full, i couldnt help myself when eating these chicken fingers, i just couldnt stop!  best bet is, take the number of chicken fingers you 'think' you can eat, subtract 1, and order that dish.  youll be one happy camper!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location almost weekly for 9 months and the experience just isn't there anymore for DRIVE-THRU. Some things I've noticed over the course of that time is that if you plan on coming here during busy times like noon, 3-5pm, 7-midnight on Friday/Saturday or most other nights is that you better be damn good at parking in tight spaces and maneuvering around the drive-thru line that is probably wrapped around the building. Also bring something to do during rush times for drive-thru, cause if the line is around the building and out onto the street you could be waiting for 20 minutes.  More recently this place has steadily gone downhill in order consistency, they almost always screw something up, and it's not like I haven't tried through Cane's feedback to suggest ways that they could do better, so they've had plenty of opportunities to improve things for drive-thru customers such as myself. It's like a 35 minute round-trip for me to come here for chicken fingers, plus the wait in the line, and it's just no fun getting home and the order being wrong especially when the receipt is correct but the food isn't.  I mean there's no way to check unless you park or have people in the car, because as soon as you get your order you don't have anywhere to go except out onto Stapley road. Even if you were to figure out the order was wrong, good luck trying to fix that at a rush time, it'll take 10+ minutes just to get it right, and then the rest of your food will be getting cold at the same time.   The chicken is damn good, the Texas toast is damn good, the sauce is good, and they have some awesome crinkly cut fries. I'm not arguing that the food is bad, I'm just saying that the drive-thru experience is terrible. Their intercom system at this location is BAD. It'll take you back to 1999 McDonald's quality. The clarity is just not there. If this location had a better intercom system and the employees could actually understand what you're saying then it would be awesome, everything would probably be correct, and everyone would be happy. This review is focused just on the drive-thru experience.  Edit: Laz from Raising Cane's did contact me and we had a good 5-minute talk about the locations, and that feedback was important. I agree. He corrected the wrong order with vouchers, and I'd suggest if you have similar issues that you also leave feedback with Raising Cane's and not just yelp. Moved rating from 2 stars to 3 stars for this location. I still love Raising Cane's, just that I've had recent issues with the Stapley location."}
{"text":"Dang. I started going to this location because I hated getting messed up orders from the Stapley location but I guess I made a terrible mistake. This location sucks.  Their line system is bad, it's always slow, no matter what time of the day, if there's 2-5 cars in line you could be there for awhile. I have no idea why this is, but I've been to this location 5-6 times now and it is always the same slow speed. The way they designed the drive-thru at this location is pretty bad, seemingly no thought went into it because it's placed awkwardly at a corner. The Stapley location has lines that are 2-3x larger and they're about 2-5x faster.   The speaker system still sucks, you'd think for being a new location it would be better, it's not. The employees from what I've seen seem nice and helpful, but every time I'm waiting for my food I just see them talking to each other and laughing while moving slowly to do anything useful.   One of the times I was there (about two weeks ago) their drinks had literally no carbonation at all, it was nasty, and I didn't discover this until I was back at home. On the other hand, there's plenty of parking spaces, but as I said earlier, the drive-thru system they have is annoyingly  complicated if there's a line, as they use cones to direct traffic in a weird squiggly line.  The food is mostly good, at least once the chicken has been undercooked, the fries seemed soggy, and something was off about the sauce. Mostly pretty good on the food part.   Raising Cane's is awesome chicken, but maybe go to the Stapley location instead (feels weird saying that since I had issues with them as well within the last 6 months)."}
{"text":"I love canes! But this location sucks! Every time I order through drive thru they always give me the wrong order! It makes me mad that I always order an extra canes sauce and they never put it in my order! I pay extra for for a canes sauce!"}
{"text":"I originally went to this location on 12/11/15 and was NOT happy.  The cashier Kyle S. was super friendly and very professional. However, my order got mixed up and I ended up waiting more than 15 minutes for my take out order.  When I inquired about my order to Kyle S. he went into action and had them prepare my order immediately. Kyle apologized and went over to tell his manager what  happened.    Well, the manager on duty, not sure of his name NEVER even bothered to apologize for the mix up.  Never bothered to offer me a drink or something for sitting there all that time, he never said a word to me.  Like I just don't count.   I came back today and decided to eat in because I was taking a wonderful person out to lunch for her birthday, Ms. Anna Maria.  The food was WONDERFUL and she really enjoyed it.  When I asked to speak with the manager Mikey Anderson came over to our table, I explained the prior service and he asked for a minute to check something out..well he came back with a 5 employees and they sang Ms. Anna Maria, Happy Birthday!  I was so happy and pleased that Mikey cared enough about the customer to do this and that he  wanted us to know that Raising Cane's is not some fly by night organization.  They appreciate our business and our loyalty. This was a wonderful experience all around and I am very pleased.  Just wanted to thank Mikey for his dedication to the customer and his efforts are much appreciated.  We will be back again.  The place was clean, the food was GREAT and the employees were happy, I cant ask for more than that.  Thanks for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"After hearing and reading about how good this place is, I was excited to finally try it out last weekend. However, nothing from the meal really stood out as crazy good. It definitely wasn't bad, just didn't live up to the hype. Pretty good sauce, nice tenders, standard fries, and alright toast. My dinner was lacking a wow factor. But I'll give it another go the next time I'm in town just to make sure it just wasn't an off night."}
{"text":"Love the chicken!  But for the love of Mike please put in some blinds! The sun is horrible in the afternoon. I am sitting in the restaurant and half the people are wearing shades."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru tonight and we have been here a handful of time since the store has opened and never had any issues. Went tonight after a long exhausting and needing a quick dinner and we get home and they messed up our order completely. Spoke to paul who is a manager who could honestly careless about the fact they messed our order up and the only thing he could do for us, is for us to go allll the way back to the store for them to give us the food we orginally ordered or go back to the store to get a refund. But all he basically said to me was that my business wasnt important and that he doesnt want me to ever eat there again. So thank you paul ill make sure not to spend my money at canes again :)"}
{"text":"Finally, after years of hearing people rave about @raisingcanes, we tried it. The chicken definitely tasted much more fresh than most fast food chains and it seemed significantly less greasy. Their dipping sauce is pretty yummy too. :-D  Pinky rating: * * * * Proppy rating: * * * * (From a fast food perspective)"}
{"text":"You have to try this place. The first time I tried it was in Las Vegas and I am glad they are here is Arizona now."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is goood!! The food is perfect, not greasy. The spicey dipping sauce is flavorful & goes great with the chicken fingers & the fries... Plus the service was speedy, and the place is shiny and new! Loved it :-)"}
{"text":"I have been eating Canes forever! Im from Baton Rouge where it all started. I've NEVER experienced a bad meal until this location! My fries taste as if they were fried in old grease, my Arnold Palmer wasn't sweet at all, &&& my tenders were GROSS. They were dry with NO FLAVOR!! I'm disappointed because I was excited about Las Vegas having Raising Canes locations, guess I'll wait until I get back to Louisiana."}
{"text":"I love the experience of eating chicken fingers and toast while watching Jimmy Fallon. Also, pants unbuckled makes for a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am from Vegas and generally speaking I love this place. However, this location needs to step it up. I work in customer satisfaction so I am a bit over the top with this sort of thing but when I visit an establishment if you are messing up more often than not (especially when I come a lot) that is really just unacceptable. I love Cane's because they manage to make a chicken hater love chicken. I get sick from it easily so on the rare occasion fingers sound good (it's the only chicken I eat) I always at any restaurant, order well done or extra crispy. I ask for this EVERY TIME I send a co-worker or my BF or go myself, and I get it 1 out 10 times. I see it and see it and see it and have said something but nothing is changing. You guys are not exactly cheap so make my money worth it for me because I have stopped going as much due to this."}
{"text":"Best chicken I've ever had in a fast food restaurant.when you're in a hurry quick service clean service well attendant an fast an easy service well recommend"}
{"text":"My family and I went here last night because my daughter wanted \"chicky\" and we were driving down Thomas so decided to give it a try.  Definetly NOT a place we will be dying to come back to.  They don't have any options other than how many pieces you want.  There are no flavor options for the chicken, they just come in plain flavor.  The texas toast they served wasn't very toasty at all and the fries were cold and un-seasoned.  Service was fast & friendly - 1 star.  The chicken tasted pretty darn good - another star."}
{"text":"This is a MUST whenever I'm in Vegas. My Vegas trip just isn't complete without stopping by Raising Canes. One time my boyfriend and I even took a cab from the hotel just to pick up food from here. That's how badly we wanted raising canes. We had the taxi driver go through the drive thru lol.   This place has forever raised my standards for a great chicken tenders. I have even had a dream that Raising Canes had opened a location in San Diego. What a beautiful dream...hoping one day it will become reality. I would easily sacrifice my local Chick Fil A or KFC for a Raising Canes. Writing this review is very painful, with the images of dipping that crispy chicken finger into the secret sauce haunting my mind.  I order the Caniac Box, it comes with 6 pieces, crinkle fries, coleslaw, Texas toast, two sauces, and a drink. Not a fan of coleslaw so substitute for extra toast and yes, the toast is amazing with a butter taste. The fries are average but at Raising Canes, all you need is the chicken, toast, and sauce. Use the sauce for everything, dip the fries and dip the bread. You will have to pay for extra sauce, but totally worth it.  Next time you are driving into Las Vegas, stop by Raising Canes to kick off your Vegas trip. In my opinion, Raising Canes is as much as a staple for Vegas eats such as Earl of Sandwich and Secret Pizza. Driving back home after a wild Vegas stay is depressing and sad, but stopping by Raising Canes on the way home may brighten your mood. Yes, I have done that before (3 Caniac Boxes to go please). Come to SD please!"}
{"text":"Decent place for chicken strips. Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything negative to say about Raising Cane's -- especially this one in Centennial.  I've always had great service there, it's always impeccably clean, and the chicken fingers are ohhh soooo yummy.  So is their delicious special sauce! Yummm.  I also love how they'll let you exchange your cole slaw for another piece of Texas Toast.  Aint nuthin wrong with that!  Heck, I even like their ice!  I guess if I had to pick on ONE thing, it would be their fries... they could probably do a little better on those, but really.... I don't go to Cane's for their fries so I don't care too much.  I go for the chicken.  And they do that RIGHT."}
{"text":"This one just opened up by my house I was excited the food was good no complaints there. The only thing that bothered me was one girl working there doesn't watch out for customers. I went to get ketchup and right when She's about to bump into me with the ice tea she says excuse me. I was like okay until she elbowed me while passing me like that's definitely not acceptable. I didn't catch her name but she had dark hair I believe Mexican and a little big. The other employees were super nice."}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had. They started out by messing up my order. When I drove up to the first window, I thought my order was right. Unfortunately, at the second window they only gave me half my order. I had to park, get out of my car and go inside to get the rest of my order. A lot of people working there but very disorganized. I don't think I will go to that location again!"}
{"text":"Caniac Combo is Awesome!   We Eat Here all the time and Love It!  Chicken is always fresh, tender and juicy. Cole slaw is Perfect!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Don't know what's happened at this Canes, but the chicken is dry and very thin pieces!  Used to be so good."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers are average, the fries below average, the Texas toast, coleslaw, and Cane sauce are great. The employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"It only takes one bad experience, food poisoning in 2011... it was more painful than the time I ate tacos from a street vendor taco stand in Queretaro Mexico.  I did eat there a couple times with no ill effects, and never had problems with Cains on the other side of town."}
{"text":"I tried this place on the advice of a coworker that usually hates everything. So I figured if he liked it then it must be good. I went through the drive through on a Friday night so I wasn't surprised that it was pretty busy. But the line moved pretty fast. I ordered the three strip combo and took it home.   I must say the chicken strips are possibly the only ones I've ever tried that tastes like fresh chicken as opposed to frozen. The Texas Toast was also tasty as well as the sauce. I wasn't that hungry so I didn't eT the fries so I can't comment on those.   Bottom line is that I will go back. But since the menu is very limited I won't be going all of the time."}
{"text":"You guys suck. I was the walk up customer that did not arrive in a car. I showed you I had a valid ID and not a safety hazard but you refused to take my order at the window and would not let me inside the dining area to order because you did not have a cashier to assist me. Good thing it was a nice evening to walk to your establishment for the last time. I like to thank the manager for nothing."}
{"text":"Ive eaten at this Cane's too many times to count. It's always busy so be prepared for a little bit of a wait. (Worth it) Coming from the south where Zaxbys and Slim Chickens are on every other corner. Cane's is a great substitute. It's fried chicken. How could it not be delicious? Cane sauce"}
{"text":"Good stuff every time!   If only more places knew how to cook chicken like these guys do.  Fresh cut chicken breast strips, lightly breaded, with great seasoning and dipping sauce.  Best chicken fingers around.  I even eat the slaw, and I'm not a big fan, but theirs is good.  You got to try it.  Kids will love it!"}
{"text":"This wasn't my first time tasting Raising Canes. But it's been a while since my taste buds could remember so I decided to refresh their memory.  So I got the \"most popular\" combo, The Box - 3 fingers, fries, Texas toast, Cole slaw and special sauce. I will admit the quality of the fingers is great especially for fast food. However, my fries were chewy and I could tell unlike their fingers, this particular batch wasn't fresh. The Cole slaw was nothing special (and I actually didn't even bother to finish it). The Texas toast was mediocre and I've honestly had better store bought toast.  Lastly their sauce... when I dipped my chicken in and stuck it in my mouth, I didn't experience any fireworks or any \"wow\" effect. It didn't make me want to chug buckets full of this stuff. It was just ... eh.  The fingers get 2 stars and 1 more star for service since the cashier greeted me with a whimsical chicken rhyme.  Raising Canes is great on the go but I suggest they sell the fingers by themselves. I don't need the extra fluff."}
{"text":"Crap location with bad management and front line service.. Came in on 2/27/15.. Managers were there in the lobby for a meeting with NO customers.. I waited 20 minuets to get my meal while the teenagers in the back laughed and managers stood around and talked about nothing. If you want to go a fast food restaurant without the fast.... This is your place"}
{"text":"Very good chicken fingers, good fries, friendly stuff And clean restrooms.  Like cane's!!!"}
{"text":"Best Chickenfinger's ever!  Came back from Germany...and the taste was as expected, very good!  Cool and friendly stuff, Gabriel is can be found everywhere, doing everything! ;-)  We will come back, if we can."}
{"text":"This place is really good and decently priced you can get what they call a box combo 4 less than 7 Bucks it comes with chicken strips fries coleslaw and a drink and don't forget the bread the delicious bread.. if you bring your dog with you through the drive-thru they will offer your dog Milk Bones. They have really good unsweet tea but their sweet tea is a bit too much for my taste. But their cane sauce is to die for it is good on everything from chicken to fry and then some the only thing that I have to complain about this place is there drive-thru horribly placed it wraps around the building and oftentimes you are stuck with your ass hanging out in traffic or blocking somebody from backing out but they do their best and try to keep the line moving but it is a very popular place so it is always packed I suggest going before the dinner and lunch rush around 3:30 especially if you want to go with a large crowd for the kids it is hard to find a table but that is very minor thing in my eyes the way I see it the more people better the food"}
{"text":"Simply satisfying.  Delicious chicken strips and sides - FAST service and everyone friendly as can be.  The only slight is the high carb menu - Texas Toast and Fries?  More slaw then. Otherwise,Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"I like chicken fingers and have been watching this place go up. The place is brand new. There was plenty of parking. The service was efficient and friendly. But there is more to lunch than looks.  The 3 finger combo is just under $6.00 so even light eaters should bring a fat wallet. I was hungry and went for the 6 finger \"Caniac Combo\" for $8.30. My 11 year old son and I don't spend as much in a sit down restaurant as we did on today's fast food  lunch. There was plenty of food, unfortunately there is significantly more bad fries than average chicken. The chicken fingers are at best average and the sauce did not impress. Fortunately we had some Tobasco buffalo sauce to kick it up a notch. The fries are Ore-Ida without the crispy golden-brown outside or steamy inside.  The combo professes to include Texas Toast - mine did not. I took the time to call and let them know. They did not apologize, just asked me to hold. No longer friendly or efficient :(  Eventually they came back on the line and let my son (I had to get back to work) know they would take care of it next time. Neither of us knows what that means and we not likely to find out."}
{"text":"hey, you forgot ketchup. no worries im on my way back. Have it ready for me, im gonna drive around everyone in the drive through and just nuzzle right in, be there in T-3 minutes"}
{"text":"Everything was super simple. Chicken is very lightly breaded and seasoned, not at all greasy and made fresh there, not frozen and from a box.  The toast is super good, the fries, although they are crinkle cut are crispy, and the sauce is interesting. I will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Soggy Chicken strips, AND THATS ALL THEY SELL! not impressed. Way over priced and the 31 cents it cost me extra  for the honey mustard ensured I'll never return. What a waste of a corner, too bad it's on the mesa side we cant afford another losing business."}
{"text":"OK - the chicken was tasty but the manager was extremely disappointing.  I heard great things about Raising Canes and went there around 2 pm for a mid day snack and ordered 2 chicken strips.  I noticed other guests had a sauce with their meals and I asked a man walking around deliver food about the sauce and he said it comes with several of the meals but is EXTRA if you order al la carte.  So I explained that I was in for the first time and wanted to try the restaurant.  He proceeded to tell me how good the special sauce was and then told me it was 31 cents.  I said I had no cash and paid with a credit card and he told me to pay for it and he would bring it to me!!  So now I felt odd and stood back in line behind two people and waited to pay thirty one cents for a sauce while my food was getting cold.     The Chicken was as an A but the management is a D-.  Who makes a customer wait back in line for a $0.31 charge behind others when they already have their food??  The cashier was embarrassed as the manager guy told her to charge me for the small sauce.  She grimaced and said \"I am sorry\""}
{"text":"I truly would five this location 10 STARS!! I received the best customer service ever. The gentleman at the first window greeted me with a smile. The gentleman at the second window was friendly and polite. The food is always delicious. I'm so happy this location opened right up the street from my work."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first Time. The taste was promising. Fries and Chicken strips are exceptionally good with low oil content. Thumbs up for Canes !!"}
{"text":"Cainiac combo....yes please. Their lemonade is GREAT."}
{"text":"I have been going here since they opened. Very good food, sometimes I hit it for lunch. Dinner hours -I bring the family and we have a little party. Chicken is so tender and I never had a dry finger.The employees are happy and they greet everyone. Love it."}
{"text":"Been a while since I've been to good ole Canes. Very happy I stopped in. Prices very reasonable and they taste just like I remember!!"}
{"text":"Food was not bad, not great, just average.  Friendly staff.   Would I eat there again?  Maybe if I had a coupon."}
{"text":"It was our first and last experience with this place. Not many choices as everything is fried but my husband decided to get a chicken strip sandwich. None of us particularly liked our meal but whatever...we're heading to Vegas. A short time later on the road and my husband gets soooo sick. Obviously food poisoning. We're on our 2nd night in Las Vegas and he's still in bed nauseous. Never. Again."}
{"text":"You want some straight up fingers and fries? This is the place. I eat here all the time. If you want crispy fingers and fries with Cane's sauce, POW! This is it!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, excellent chicken fingers and fries. The sweet tea is just right and you can substitute the toast for an extra coleslaw or vise versa. They are quick to make your food and will go above and beyond for you!"}
{"text":"I live down the street and my boyfriend and I love coming to raising canes. The service is great! Aside from a few times of our order coming out wrong, still really good."}
{"text":"Best chicken and toast ever!come here a lot after a hard workout for their chicken and toast,and their amazing sauce."}
{"text":"The best chicken fingers in a long time. They were so soft and juicy. Could tell that they have marinated it well and it's fresh. The crinkle cut fries could have been more crunchy. Definitely not good for a to go, since they will go soft pretty quickly. The Texas toast is a good add on. Absolutely loved their sauce.  The service is fantastic, greeting all your visitors and being enthusiastic and warm, definitely makes for a good visit.  The pricing is good for the quantity and affordable for students too since this is near the University."}
{"text":"Very good and very affordable..probably the freshest fast food chicken that I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"After my friend recommended me to this place, claiming it's the best chicken in the world I had to give it a try. I'm tired of eating buffets and expensive food on the strip every time I go to Vegas. The chicken here is amazing!  I can't say it's the best chicken in the world but definitely top 3. It taste better than Roscoe's for those who know which place I'm talking about. It's crispy and very juicy. Fries are fresh and hot. Normally I don't think a fast food restaurant deserve a 5 stars but it's the service here that took this place to another level. Not only did they serve the food to your table, but every single employee there are working hard: making rounds asking if everything was alright, constantly cleaning, offering to take our finished plate away, and always smiling and very polite. I've never seen a fast food restaurant that even offer half of those services. In fact I don't even see those in a fancy restaurant. 5 stars to the management team! I would come back again to see if I get the same experience next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers are good...but the sauce is amazing!!  Toast was pretty stinkin good too!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have had the worst service at Cane's!!! We go to Cane's one or two time a month. We love the place. The employee are always up beat, good service!!! NOT THIS TIME!!! The drive thru was so long so i went in side. Was that the worst mistake I did. The girl (Monique 293, 12/1/14 7:05pm) that took my order acted like she did not want to be there ( all the employee acted that way), rude, got my order wrong, did not ask me anything ( if i want Lemonade), (I usually go through the drive thru) i had a Buy a box and get free box combo on my Cane's card. I order a Box and a Caniac Combo. I thought i could order a Caniac and a Box because Caniac is more money. Not this case! She called the manager over to fix it and she told him wrong thing about the order. So I paid for two combos and got the Box combo for free. I only needed two combs. The manger also acted like I was putting him out to fix the order. Then i went to get the drinks, there was no lemonade so the manager was at the counter i ask if i could get a lemonade, he said to me that is usually it a up charge, he gave it to me any ways. I could not wait to get out of there i was so upset! BAD CANE BAD BOY!!!! I think you need to do some new training with your employees."}
{"text":"Really good. The menu is simple, consisting of primarily chicken fingers. But they do one thing well instead of a million things half heartedly. I think a lot of restaurants could learn a lesson or two from this place. Also, the sauce is pretty good. And if you don't like it I guess you're SOL."}
{"text":"Omg! It has to be the most favorite. Eating eatablishment thate and my nine year old son frequent. From the juicy tenders to creamy coleslaw.  Not to mention the friendly staff, that makes you feel welcome. Any time of the day or nifht"}
{"text":"Oooohh everyone loves Cane's!  Can't get enough of Cane's!  Quality, HUGE servings, amazing amazing amazing indescribable chicken.  Sauce rules too.  So does their texas toast.  Every time we have guests from out of town this is a sure hit! A must on the list!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try the chicken fingers as I had been craving some all day. This was my first time here so I didn't really know what the menu was. Actually thought that the streamlined menu was good. I figured since the menu was simple that everything would be very good. I ordered two \"Box\" combos. The chicken tenders were tender but had no flavor. How can your signature item be bland. The Texas toast also had no butter or garlic flavor and was barely toasted. The fries were just basic small crinkle cut fries but did not hold any salt on them. The cole slaw was ok but not great. The best part of the meal was the sauce but I really wasn't expecting to have to drown the chicken tenders in sauce to give them flavor.  I had high hopes but was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers are such a basic concept, but the type of breading makes all the difference.  The fingers here are plump and juicy and the breading is actually light and crunchy, while I wouldn't call them my favorite chicken finger I have ever eaten, I would say they are my favorite fast food chicken finger.  They are much better than KFC or Jack in the Box, and there is something about the simplicity of the menu that I really like.  I love that they have crinkle fries, which in my opinion or the best fry you can get and the Cane's sauce is addictive!  It is cool, creamy with a punch of flavor, and I dip chicken and fries in it equally.  When I get \"The Box\" I always sub an extra sauce for the coleslaw, which I could care less about but it isn't bad.  The Texas toast is a somewhat odd addition, but no carb lover should turn their nose up at it!  Probably my most favorite thing at Raising Cane's is the lemonade...it is the BEST lemonade I have ever had, much better than Chic-Fil-A's which I sometimes think is sour.  Sometimes chicken strips just sound good, and Raising Cane's satisfies, so give it a try!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with Raising Cane's customer service today at the location on rainbow I had to create a yelp account. Very rarely if at all do you go into a restaurant(fast food or not) and get approached by management to make sure everything is great and bid a good day by staff that didn't even see you up until you left. Even if the food was bad, which it wasn't, it was great, I would still go back strictly based on the pleasant experience I had!"}
{"text":"WTF YO? 5 people on line, and service is madd slow for a busy crowd.  Never come at lunchtime 12 noon and expect quick service from THIS Cane's EVER!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are no stranger to baskets of the chicken strip variety. We shared the 6-strip basket and it was more than enough for both of us. The fries were perfectly crispy with no signs of sogginess and the Texas toast was the best my wife has had. The strips themselves were luscious. Crispy. Juicy. Not greasy. We will be back for more.  The special sauce was good, but diminishing marginal utility quickly set in.  I was looking for something spicier or different. If other sauces were available, it wasn't obvious to my wife who ordered. Regardless, we wish one was closer to where we live."}
{"text":"First visit to a Raising Canes..Mixed review here.  On the good side--chicken was fresh, juicy, hot, and flavorful. Fries were fresh from the fryer..  On the not so good side--Fries were the \"old school\" crinkle cut, processed fries you used to get 20+ years ago..Texas toast served with the meal was lightly toasted on one side only, and was not the least bit warm. Sauce served with fingers was a very \"different\" flavor than the norm.. The cashier described it as a mix of ranch and honey mustard.. I didnt get any sweet or mustard out of it. More like a chilipowder ranch??? I would prefer a country gravy, a real honey mustard, or sweet and sour and/or bbq.  But the worst part, IMHO, was the little cup of coleslaw.. Totally devoid of flavor. It was like they mixed cabbage with watery mayonnaise.   My \"box combo\" was 4 smallish fingers, some fries, the little cup of coleslaw,and a small soda..It was $7.00 with tax. I would've been ok with the price if the slaw had been decent, the toast had been toasted and warm, and if they had better/more choices for sauce. But at this price, I was disappointed with what I got."}
{"text":"I'm not a really big fan when it comes to fast food but hands down to this place. Their chicken fingers are so moist, tender and juicy with a tangling natural chicken flavor. Their soft pillow like Texas toast is to die for. I felt like I was in chicken paradise for a moment till my finance 'accidentally' took a bite at the last piece of the chicken finger. Staring at his satisfying grin, I had to question his explanation. Anyway this was a great eating experience despite the complain coming from my tummy after all the fries glided in my stomach."}
{"text":"Great go to spot. I gave up chicken and after a long drive and flight to Vegas with this being the first restaurant other the usual. I must say that it was great..."}
{"text":"First time trying Raising Cane no complaints Excellent Customer Service dining area super clean food awesome Chicken Strips very juicy and hot... The bread so good ((Yummy)) The Fries are Fried to perfection the Cole Slaw so Creamy they give you so much food. (( A lot for your Buck)) I would go back No Questions ask.... I'm there lol so if u ever in the Las Vegas Area Stop By this place you want b Disappointed!!! FYI it's Located Right across from the Mall. So eat first then walk it off... Great Location"}
{"text":"Again another hometown (LA) food that has come to the valley and we stop in whenever we get into town.  The chicken is great, the fries are crinkle cut and I love the bread on top!  But the best part is the \"Sauce\"!  The restaurant is clean, the food is good and I love the sauce!"}
{"text":"The menu is very limited; all the food here comes in one color: #cc7722 aka ochre. The chicken strips and crinkle fries are a little better here than at other fast food joints. Psst, the rumor is the secret dipping sauce is a mixture of ketchup, mayo, Worcestershire and spices ... shhh!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the chicken at Cane's... I recommend this place! The chicken has a light crust with delicious white breasted chicken. The fries, bread and dipping sauce complete the meal."}
{"text":"This is my solid pick as the best friend chicken fingers in Vegas. Fast, reliable service every trip. #notabot"}
{"text":"Today was my second time eating at Raising Cane's and I can certainly say, \"Yum, I'll be back\". I don't do much fast food and don't do a lot of chicken out, but I have been impressed with the taste and quality at this place. I get the three piece meal, which is more than enough food for me and it's a great value.    It was a little too crowded today at lunch (I'm sure not for them) for us to sit and eat there, but I had no problem taking it and eating in my car...that's how good the food is. The service is always friendly. All I can ask for now is that they open one around Eastern and St. Rose Pkwy...they would make a killing!!! This is the place to go for fast food!"}
{"text":"Canes proves that its not the size of the chicken finger, its what they do with it that counts. haha Great chicken fingers, great bread, great service, great sauce, fries are soso. High school football teams, cheer teams and dance teams from Arbor View, Centennial and Shadow Ridge usually stop by before or after a game - so you know this place has good food !!  Also, very interesting Chuck Norris facts on the wall. - Chuck Norris is so fast he can run around the world and punch himself in the back of the head. - When Chuck Norris does a push up, he doesnt lift himself up, he pushes the Earth down. haha & ha. Eat Here! Chuck Norris says so!"}
{"text":"First time going here last night :) my friends recommend it so why not. I tried the finger sandwich toasted combo. It was amazing bread was good, the fingers were delicious, fries were on point, but I love their special sauce the most! Only reason I'm giving it a 4 star is because the employees were cleaning around me when I was eating the whole time -.- and they wanted to charge me for a refill! In the end I like it and most definitely will be going back to Cane's."}
{"text":"Food is good, I am from the southern east coast and was looking for food I am used to having back home. I thought this would be like Zaxby's and I was right it sure is similar.   Only downfall to here is that they only offer the Canes Sauce, which is a Cajun based sauce and I am not big on Cajun, they should add some more sauces and then it would be perfect!"}
{"text":"Raising canes at this location is really busy.  I'm not discrediting that.  It seems that the food is not as fresh like other locations through out the valley."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Chicken!! Always have a great experience,great, friendly & fast service.. the Texas Toast,& head over heels for the Canes dipping Sauce!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I love Raising Canes. Get The Box Combo and Sweet tea mixed with Lemonade. BEST CHICKEN AND TEXAS TOAST EVER!"}
{"text":"Went to visit my friend and he got me the box, a bit salty chicken but i love chicken however it is! I was in love with everything else even the sweet tea. bread was great, coleslaw and fried were fire.  To me they could raise the price and it'll still be worth it but don't do that please! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is honestly the best fast food restaurant I have ever been to! My husband had tried it when it first opened after a coworker told him about how good it is. He absolutely loved it and took me to eat there a few days later and I was just so impressed with how nice it is inside and how nice the employees are! And of course I was the most impressed with the food! The food is cooked to order and the sauce and sweet tea they have is OUT OF THIS WORLD!! Of course everything is super fattening but eating at Cane's once a month is definitely not going to kill you! lol =)"}
{"text":"Bland chicken, one sauce option, a piece of toast, fries, and corporate cole slaw.  That's it folks."}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone is crazy about this place. chicken fingers tasted ordinary for me, sauce is forgettable, fries are soggy, and coleslaw is like the one in the supermarket. the only one i liked is the toasted bread.  Though the store and location is great and neat."}
{"text":"I attempted to order a Three Finger with slaw instead of toast via the drive thru 5/16/15 around 10pm. The female employee said \"slaw does not come with that choice\". I asked her if I could make a substitution. An individual named Mike(a portly white fellow with a goatee) took over and said \"you can't have slaw because a Three Finger comes with toast\". I asked if substitutions are allowed. Without saying no he said \"I could not get slaw with my choice\", I told them to cancell my order. Once at the window they hesitated to open it. I asked the felmale employee if they were unable or unwilling to complete my order. Mike jumped in and sarcasticly said \"it was a misunderstanding and he could get I wanted\". After waiting for five minutes to exit the drive thru I lost interest. What is most disturbing is how uncomfortable Mike's coworkers appeared around him.   To be treated badly for making a simple request is baffling. This is the second time at this location they have pulled this kind of shenanigan. I will not return to any of your restaurant's."}
{"text":"The menu is very basic chicken fingers and fries, but really good.  The chicken is very flavorful and fresh. There was a long line, nevertheless it went by fast. The atmosphere is good, great service and good prices. If you want to try good chicken fingers this is your place."}
{"text":"Audrey & Kim were fantastic at the drive-thru!!!! loved the food!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome chicken strips and their dipping sauce makes it all taste even better. 5 bucks for their 3 strip combo is seriously a fantastic value for what you get."}
{"text":"This place is terrific, some of the best chicken fingers I've had in quite a while.  I also really enjoyed the sauce it same with for dipping.  Great place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious. The chicken strips are fresh and cooked perfectly. The Texas Toast is great, and so is the dipping sauce. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is good however they're playing with the prices it's all a cart so if you want sauce you need to pay for it every small things play playing with the price be careful"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a huge fan of chicken, but Raising Cane's does some mighty fine chicken fingers.  The sides of TX toast and fries are also worthwhile, as is their sweet iced tea.  You feel fat in a good way after eating here."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Growing up in LA, I'm spoiled when it comes to chains like these but I was very impressed even when i was skeptical, but once I tried it i was an instant fan!  Menu is easy, and prices are pretty cheap imo.  Bread is amazing Chicken is perfect Fries are awesome  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Best chuckle strips in town hands down. Must double on the special sauce and toast!!!! Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"After the craze of the new store opening, the service declined with the buzz. My family bought four meals where they fed us burnt toast (usually the best part) and offered to replace two of them. I don't understand why they would only replace two meals when we spent the money on four-all were damaged. Kind of seems like a cheap move for a large corporate company."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I just don't get.         I took my Mom , when it first opened maybe couple years ago , I think it was .        I was not impressed then and not now.  I don't get the sauce, I can't figure out the flavor, Even Ronald  as in mcnuggets fame, got more and better tasting flavors. I hate to admit it but the nuggets r better too. The canes tenders were dry , I'm more of a dark meat fan .             I don't know how they stay open jus selling tenders. It was pretty busy at 330 in the afternoon, I jus marveled at the people enjoying their meals, trying to find another bewildered customer , that I could relate too. Mom and wife enjoyed their meals , who r these people can't b my relatives?"}
{"text":"nobody come here!!! after sitting at the drive thru for ten minutes tired from my long day at work they gave me a watered down tea that was mostly ice, i was like okay i'm crazy thirsty so i'm just gonna down this low grade beverage while i wait for my mid grade food. bam the stupid lady says theres no refills and now i had to make another stop!! no refills?!?!? wtf is that?!? why yall mf's hoarding tea like its gold?!?!? never coming here again nobody come here"}
{"text":"The chicken is unusually moist and tender.  Very good.  The breading is light, which is fine, with very subdued seasoning.  The combos come with crinkle cut fries that remind me of the frozen fries at the old drive-in theaters.  You know the ones that might be made of potato or they might be made of cardboard; could go either way.  In any event, they add nothing to the meal.  The coleslaw is average with a creamy dressing.  It too adds nothing to the meal.  I didn't much care for their version of sweet tea.  I don't know why sweet tea isn't the same everywhere, but it definitely varies.  For dipping,  there's the Cane sauce.  It struck me as an odd concoction with a lot of black pepper in it, but people must like it because, according to the menu, they charge for extra portions of it.  I would have much preferred some honey mustard or bbq sauce.  The place was clean and appeared to be well run.  I'd go back to Canes if someone insisted but personally I would just as soon go to the Colonel.  The chicken strips are tastier and there's a much bigger selection of better tasting sides."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers and Texas toast are De.Li.Ci.Ous...especially after a night of partying it up on the Strip.  One of my faves is that they sell their sweet tea in gallon jugs so you can enjoy more of it at home.  Is there a RC location in California yet?"}
{"text":"The food was great and wonderful customer service. I purchased a large order today and the manager helped carry everything out to the car. Their service was fast, efficient, and extremely courteous!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, best fast food place EVER!!! I can't get enough of that perfectly crispy and tender chicken strips, fantastic perfect fries dipped in that mysterious but wonderful sauce... Hell YES. Just thinking about it makes my mouth seriously watering.   it's cold in there though, so wear a sweater. Oh and their sweet tea is as sweet as real southern sweet tea (i.e. super sweet) so be aware cuz some people don't like all that sugar (I mix in lemonade to help).   Oh and I don't recommend taking it home with you. Everything is much better FRESH and eaten right away."}
{"text":"This place is a new kind of pathetic low for the fast food industry. My family and I went last night (11/24/14) to pick up a quick dinner for my brother only. We were all blown away by the incompetence of the staff AND management. We walked in, and promptly ordered a simple chicken sandwich for my brother. That's all. We then took a seat in their waiting area by the register and proceeded to watch the cashier gal (didn't catch her name, she wasn't wearing a nametag either) goof off with her co-workers and kitchen staff for a solid 15 minutes (it was not busy at all; we were the only ones in line at the time).   In those minutes, we watched our simple order be sent back to the kitchen THREE times for whatever reason (I don't even want to know). We then watched an employee place his order after us and receive his order before us. And finally, while being annoyed by the LOUD cashier girl goof around with her co-workers, we watched a presumable MANAGER actually see them goofing around and disregard it completely.  By this point, we were about ready to ask for a refund and leave, but we finally got our order after waiting 15 minutes. After that, the rest of my family decided to eat at the Wendy's across the street, where our large order was completed in under 5 minutes. WENDY'S has a much more competent staff than this place.  The food was good according to my brother, but not worth waiting for while employees played butt-grab with each other for 15 minutes.  Will not be coming back. Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Only good thing I like about Raising canes is their sauce..The sweet tea taste similar to McDonald's so nothing new. Also they don't accept bills over $100 beware"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first visit to Raising Cane's. I was there to commemorate my grandfather on his birthday. He always chose chicken strips when he took us out to lunch. It wasn't the usual drive through experience where they take your money and close the window in your face. The gal at the drive through took the time to connect with me and actually cared about what I was up to. The manager heard that I had never tried their chicken or special sauce and brought me a fresh chicken strip while I waited the couple minutes for my order. The chicken strips were juicy on the inside and light and flaky on the outside. No excess grease, not even on the to-go box. Thank you for brightening my day!"}
{"text":"The chicken tenders are unbelievable & the dipping sauce is out if this world in on live with be coming back again"}
{"text":"Been here a bunch and it's okay. Came the other day and got food poisoning. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"This will be short and to the point LoVe It !! And the service was very good. My daughter N law suggested we go there and I was glad we did,. Was my first time. Won't be my last."}
{"text":"Had my first Cane's meal two weeks ago and I'm hooked. I absolutely love there special dipping sauce for the chicken tenders. I'm glad I decided to try something different for a change.  This locations was super clean and the staff were super friendly!"}
{"text":"I eat here regularly and would give them a 4 star but for the diet coke. This is ridiculous it needs to be fixed. Surely a simple call for service would resolve the poor tasting flat diet coke. Or is it to much to ask"}
{"text":"I don't get it.  This place is packed but the food is marginal at best. The best part is the sweet tea. This was my first visit and I will not return. Not because of the service which was great. Even though I know it's bad for me I would rather go to KFC for the variety and great flavor. C- or D+."}
{"text":"Supperr good for a very simple meal. Average priced, their cane's sauce is a must. Oh, and their lemonade was BOMB. Simple, satisfying, will return."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Dishonesty. Went there a week ago and won a single chicken finger with a coupon on the soda cup. When I tried to claim my very generous prize  I was told \"you must claim the prize on a future visit\"  I said \"this is my future visit\" as I won the wonderful prize on a previous visit to the establishment. They did not believe me as they had given a soda cup to me before delivering the food and they assumed I was trying to cheat them for an extra chicken finger and was told again that they would not honor the winning coupon. Finally, someone of higher authority did bring a single chicken finger in a box to my table without saying a word. I really did not care about the extra chicken finger it is just the principal of offering a prize and not being willing to give the prize to the prize winner. I read all the fine print on the winning prize coupons and could not find where is says \"you must claim on a future visit\". Fortunatley for me while I was eating my food with my family we did win more food prizes. Unfortunatley for Cane's I will not be returning ever again to claim them and have been in the past a regular customer of their establisment. I assume they just want the tourist business who will not come back on a future visit to claim their prize. This way they can save money by finding a way to not give the contest prizes."}
{"text":"*What happens in Vegas.....*   After a wonderful weekend in Vegas we decided to eat here on the way out. I'd never been to Raising Canes but had heard pleasant things about it.  So after I put in my order I made my way to the fountain drinks, and noticed that they had sweet tea. I decided to try their sweet tea and it was pretty darn good. It's not as sweet as some other sweet teas I've had, and that's not a bad thing.   The chicken strips were delicious and the fact that they're not made till you order them isn't bad either. The Texas toast was a pleasant surprise too. I like their cane sauce as well.  So for those of you who love ranch on anything that you consume Canes doesn't have ranch. Now don't freak out....give their cane sauce a try you might actually like it."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is spectacular! Customer service is their number one priority and the people who take your order even make me laugh on the regular. Their other number one priority is quality chicken. Thats's right, they have two number one priorities. They are multitasking their excellence! Also they will substitute stuff like if I don't want coleslaw i can just have more fries or another AMAZING dipping sauce. Oh man I just remembered the sauce. I gotta go guys, i need to go eat some raising cane's. You should too, but lemme get my order in first."}
{"text":"Decided to try Cane's after a friend recommended it and couldn't be happier,  Great value, 6 peace strip meal for just over $8.  Not to mention the fries, Texas toast, slaw and drink.  Great value and great food."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers are outstanding.  They advertise never frozen chicken, and it makes a big difference.  Not greasy at all, but very moist meat.  Dipping sauce is also excellent.  French fries are average at best.  Seemed undercooked.  Texas toast was like a toasted hotdog bun - very plain.  Excellent fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"I previously posted a glowing review of this place after a couple of good experiences, but after several consecutive visits experiencing *horrendous* drive thru wait times, I'm updating this to one star. There is no excuse for how slow the service is here. I look at the other customers in line and they're all shaking their heads in disbelief of the wait times.   From the time I pull into the lot until I'm pulling back out onto Thomas Ave has averaged about 15 minutes over the past several visits. That's ridiculous for fast food.  \"We're busy\" is NOT an excuse. They're are only 2 chicken items on the menu! I get the impression that every order is made-to-order. I can't think of any other reason why the wait time is the same as a sit-down restaurant.   I get the appeal of freshly cooked food. I do. But during lunch and dinner times it's idiotic to cook each order as it comes in. Again, this place only have two items.   ADVICE TO MANAGEMENT: Look at historical sales data. It can't be that hard to forecast sales. You only serve two kinds of chicken! Just keep cooking the fingers until the lines thin out. Worst case scenario is that you're throwing out a handful of unused fingers. The upside is that you're moving twice as many (if not more) customers through your lines with equally fresh food, and not having people see the drive thru line from Thomas Ave and say to themselves \"f this!\"   For those reading this wanting chicken nearby, there's a Pollo Loco and other places that serve chicken within a block of so of this place. Don't wait in line for ~15 minutes here. It's not worth it."}
{"text":"If you like tasteless breaded chicken ... Eat here. Everyone I saw drunk so that explains it all."}
{"text":"I took my first trip to Raising Cane's on Memorial Day! First the the young lady Kendall provided excellent customer service from a polite introduction to great service for all my needs. Second the quality of the food was great and was visibly hot and fresh. Overall I give my experience a 10/10 and recommend Raising Cane's not only for the great food but great service!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken fingers. Just the right amount of breading. Their sauce goes hand in hand with their chicken. Place is super clean and their staff is super helpful. They were able to handle a big order in a quick time."}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience eating here. It was during the night time, and Tyrus and Zoey were very nice and provided great customer service. They'll be the reason of my next visit here."}
{"text":"Love Love Love Cane's.... Such a good reminder of home! (It was started in Louisiana... WooT!) I'm sure many people have the initial reaction of \" All they have is chicken strips?\" but after they have it they'll agree that it is all they need!  and I could put Cane's Sauce on EVERYthing... So Yummy!"}
{"text":"This review is of the new raising cane's off of st rose Pkwy. First time to this vendor. Went in to order but for takeout, since I had no idea what to get, didn't want to go through drive thru.. Got the 3 fingers combo, but wanted slaw instead of fries. No prob. Rest of family orders & we go. About 25 minutes later & get to work, & my order has fries, no slaw. Uggg, go back to place to remedy. Yes they fixed it but I' m now 50 plus minutes into this, & they gave me the smallest chicken strips ever. No sauce either. Thought it should come with sauce so that may be my fault. Chicken dry. Not impressed. Not going back...don' t know why the big deal about this place."}
{"text":"This was the best fried chicken I have ever had. I wasn't expecting much but a person I was vacationing with had heard good things, so we went for lunch before we left town and it was great. The service was quick and polite, using our names. The chicken was flavorful and came with a great dipping sauce that had a little spice. The toast was awesome and the fries were pretty good too. The place was clean and comfortable. I will definitely be going to another one of these restaurants if I see one again."}
{"text":"People would talk about this place so much so my husband and I decide to check it out. It was okay nothing real big about this place there sauce is different but I like my chicken strips with Ranch and they didn't carry it. But the chicken was okay."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Canes Chicken since it opened in Baton Rouge in 1996.  After moving to LV a year ago this was a welcomed friend.  The food is always hot and fresh.  If you haven't tried their honey mustard sauce do so.  I really can't decide which sauce I like better, the regular or honey mustard.  Only complaint is the store is just too loud when it is full of families' w/kids, more like Chuck E Cheese.  So I now I don't go on Saturdays at lunch."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out since Chickfila is closed on Sundays.  Surprisingly it was good.  Got the 6 ct meal:  lightly breaded not too greasy juicy chicken, skinny crinkle-cut fries, very buttery Texas toast and typical cole slaw.  It also comes with a light cajan sauce dip.   A good alternative to chickfila especially on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Tried their chicken strips for the first time last week. Pretty good for fast food.  A little on the pricey side but I guess no more than the competitor across the street. Will go there again."}
{"text":"5 STARS.  Yeah, I know I know... 5 stars for a fast food restaurant... am I crazy?  Am I weird?  No no no... well... maybe. :)  But 5 stars because the chicken fingers are simply the best.  I don't like much of anything else here.  Well they don't have much of anything else besides fries, toast and sweet tea here.  The fingers are juicy, well flavored and even though it's fried, it's not too greasy.  I go here at least once a week for some good and cheap lunch.  Anyone working downtown wanna join me?"}
{"text":"First time here. Super friendly staff! Fun place to eat. Menu was simple, but delicious! Sauce is an awesome creation ;) We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time eating here we order through the drive-through. My family insisted anyone who comes to Vegas must try Raising Canes's. I ordered the 3 piece combo. The food was pretty good, the chicken was seasoned well and the bread was very tasty. If you are in town definitely try Raising Cane's."}
{"text":"I have never had Raising Cane's, but everyone has told my that their chicken is amazing.  I went and bought a box and had some lemonade with that.  They had the best tasting lemonade I have ever had.  I loved their toast.  Their fries were on point.  I didnt really care for the coleslaw (I'm not really coleslaw person).  When it came to the chicken I got extremely excited (I love chicken).  When I took my first bite of the chicken (no sauce just as is), I was extremely disappointed.  It look very good, but taste wise, it was bland, no seasoning at all.  Then I tried it with the sauce, and it was amazing.  I would put their sauce on anything.  Its just that good.   I dont know if i went on a bad day or what, but I dont mind going back.  I just need a lot of that sauce for my chicken."}
{"text":"Not bad! I like coming here whenever I'm craving some juicy chicken strips- which is pretty much all the time, ha!! I always split a basket with my boyfriend and we both get pretty darn full. The fries get a little soggy if you wait too long, but they're still alright."}
{"text":"We just had lunch here and the chicken fingers and fries were fresh and delicious. The friendliness of the staff is worth the 5 star rating alone, and even the customers in line to order were friendly and helpful.  The restaurant was spotless inside and out, as a matter of fact, a young man cleaning the windows gave us directions to nearby coffee shops. We were impressed by the food, cleanliness but most of all by the staff, these young workers really set this place apart from other fast food chains and we will be sure to stop in on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I love raising canes. It is an amazing drunken food discovery.   It's even better sober.  Their chicken is so juicy and delicious.  Everything they have is so good.   The lemonade is BOMB.   Louisiana hot sauce, great choice.   Texas toast... Yes  Try toasting it again the next morning if you have leftovers, it's amazing.   The crinkle fries are always cooked to perfection.   The canes sauce is amazing.  I love it here.  You can even become a member for free and get free canes.   The service is always great too, the workers are really friendly.   I've never had a bad experience here ever! The food and service is always consistent! No complaints here. Keep up the good work you chicken magicians!"}
{"text":"I've had better chicken before. The fries were a bit salty. But the sweet tea was pretty good and tastes like a lot of sugar Yum."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken fingers and Cane sauce. Toast & coleslaw pretty good. French fries could be better. Fries appear to be frozen and taste like it. And their Lemonade is pretty darn good.  Reasonably priced, pretty quick service but the interior can be quite noisey."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how good the chicken tenders were. When I think of chicken tenders I think of kid food. The quality of the chicken was incredible; moist and fresh tasting. The service was friendly."}
{"text":"It was my first time to eat at Cane's and I have to say I had a great experience. The person taking our order was very helpful. We were shocked how fast our order of 50 pieces was ready. I wish we had a Cane's in San Diego!!"}
{"text":"Friends have been telling me about this place for years but I never thought that chicken could be that good but we decided to stop in and that chicken is amazing. For being fried chicken it was juicy. The dipping sauce, the coleslaw, the garlic bread everything just perfect. I will definitely be visiting this place when I return to Vegas. Probably every time!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They cook all of their food fresh to order. They don't have anything except chicken fingers and sides. The lemonade is fresh squeezed and is awesome. I like to get honey mustard sauce on the side and I like to get hot sauce and add it the canes sauce."}
{"text":"I love raising canes haha first time my cousin came to town first place I took him was canes ever sine they started selling it at school ive fell in love with it lol highly recommended"}
{"text":"Everyone is very nice in Raising Cane's. Taste is really average, nothing even close to famous chicken finger."}
{"text":"Made me sick, the chicken is unseasoned and overpriced for what I had. Its just really nasty and gave nausea and a stomach ache about 10 min after eating it. Will probably never go back again."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the customer  service is great! Fresh food every time we came. The staff is always cheerful and helpful. I never have even one bad experience with them. I go to this place at least twice a week. It opens until 11 or midnight unlike the time said on this page."}
{"text":"This place has some dumbasses working there, I never review places but this is the 4th time they screwed up my meal which seems hard since they only have like 3 things in the menu  Just an update have gone back twice since then and each time was missing extra Cane's sauce that I paid for and messed up side order, will not becoming ever again"}
{"text":"I have been to all three Raising Cane's in the Valley Phoenix Area, and this one is the best. The front area is much larger here and they have many places to wait if your food is to-go. They have the option for two seater booths, which I like. The food here is of course delicious, but the chicken seemed to be less breaded than usual, with some sides of the chicken being almost visible, which is the reasoning for only 4 stars. Other than that the venue is great. It serves its purpose as a college hangout and has a youthful vibrance to it. I do like that they even added a little disco ball for some flair. The servers were kind and attentive, while giving a sense of urgency, which is what is always best in the fast food industry. The only thing I would complain about, as is with all raising canes, is the sauce. Make the frickin sauce free!"}
{"text":"I love Raising Cane's. I've been  to quite a few of them, and the never disappoint. For $19 (tax included) we got 12 tenders 2 sets of fries, drinks, and two slaws (if you want you can substitute the slaws for more fries or an extra piece of bread), and it fed 2 adults and 2 children. The food came out super fast (literally 5 minutes), and it was as delicious as usual. My only complaint is that ongoing complain of every customer that they don't give enough sauce!"}
{"text":"Really good strips but no seasoning.  Fries are awful--think Oreida. Texas toast as a side is very soft and mushy.  Coleslaw is good.  Only choice of dip is their cane sauce which is mayo and ketchup.  Don't understand why there's no other vegetable choices, mac and cheese or something like applesauce.  Also, no hot sauce or buffalo sauce?!  Oh the lemonade is great though.  We mainly get the tailgate and lemonade and take it home so we can eat it with Frank's Hot Sauce..Yum."}
{"text":"I've ordered the disco ball \"catering menu\" for my company in the past from this location. They are fast, friendly and the orders have been correct.   The chicken, bread and French fries were hot, fresh and delicious. Don't be worried about having a large order during lunch. Call ahead at least 24 hours and it will be ready. This place is always busy but that doesn't affect the food or service. Alll the employees are friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I had this for the first time in Vegas around Christmas.  Don't let the fact that this is a fast food joint fool you.  The chicken fingers are so tender.  The texas toast was soft and buttery with just enough crisp to its edge.  Mediocre coleslaw and fries comes with The Box Combo as well - but the rest of the food more than makes up for it and you didn't really go to Raising Cane's for their coleslaw and fries did you?.  Cane's sauce is what makes this though. Whatever can be dumped in Cane's sauce, should be.  It is like CRACK.  Got you wanting more and more.  Ask for (2) sauces if you're doing The Box Combo.  Believe me, you will need it.  If you're that hungry, however, order the Carniac, which comes with (6) fingers ((as opposed to just 4 in The Box Combo)) and 2 sauces.  If you dare, also get another piece of Texas Toast.  Really it is that good.  So good I came here twice in my 4 day Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Can't get chicken strips anywhere else. Fast fresh and fantastic."}
{"text":"Delicious food, went there tonight with a date. It was our first time dining in, and it was a good experience.  The cashier was friendly and helpful and the food was really great."}
{"text":"The food is always good. Chicken fingers and fries served with Texas toast and canes secret sauce."}
{"text":"My first stop on my way in town for several years now.  This is the best chicken/fast food ever. I wish they had on in California.  So simple, yet so delicious.  What baffles me is how they can make such a moist juicy tender.  And it seams to be lean all white meat.  I love the slaw, the texas toast, fries and the sauce.  Another simple pleasure is the ice. I love th little tiny pellet ice.  Great to cruch without killing your teath.  :-)"}
{"text":"I agree with some of the other posters lately it seems like they are giving me a lot more fries and a lot less chicken.  Anyway the food is always good."}
{"text":"Sorry, but neither me, nor any of my family members get the appeal of this place or why it's always packed.  Chicken was dry, bread was soggy, coleslaw was okay, fries were nothing special.  Really overpriced for what you get too, and such a limited menu.. we haven't been back and don't plan to ever eat at canes again.  Church's chicken, Long John silvers across from them, even KFC and Mcdonalds makes superior Chicken strips and items for a way better price and taste and size wise. You get nothing special at canes, really basic, overpriced, dried out chicken.   I would assume for a place that is \"famous\" for it's chicken fingers and what not it would have atleast been good.. but it's not. Worst chicken from a  fastfood/restaurant i've ever had and that's saying alot.    Don't get why this location and others is always packed.   If you want a good chicken meal , go anywhere but here. You will also get your moneys worth for alot more food that is higher quality and filling too."}
{"text":"I love this location the most!!! Every time I go to the drive-thru, the guy workers always flirt with me. Lol. Like I don't even do anything or say anything and they're already hitting on me :)  This one day, I drove into the \"pay-window\" at the drive thru, the guy reviewed my order to me and mentioned the price that I owe. I gave my card to pay and when he gave it back, he asked if he could ride in my Benz & asked if I had a boyfriend. Hahaha. I laughed! Then he was talking talk-story with me for a bit while I waited for the car before me to drive away. He was like, \"So how's your day going...Miss Beautiful?\" Then more talk-story again. The car before me was pulling off, so he ended our conversation by saying, \"well if you want, you can hit me up next time, okay?\" And winked at me. LOL!!!  This location NEVER ever messes up my order, which is a big BONUS! They also never take long for me to wait. I think the most I waited was 4 minutes, which is nothing, because that's super quick! I always get my food really fast! Plus, the food is always fresh!!!! Like it's still hot and just cooked, which I love!!!!"}
{"text":"My first time trying Raising Cane's.  I got the box, and I liked the chicken fingers, the dipping sauce and the coleslaw.  I am not a big fan of Texas toast in general so I can't gauge how good it was. I am not a big fan of their fries.  Overall, I like it."}
{"text":"The Place: Clean, Casual The Service: Inviting, Friendly  The Food: Flavorful   These are the BEST Chicken Fingers I've EVER Had! Lightly battered, Juicy, NOT too greasy, & the Cane's Sauce kicks up the Flavor a Few Notches! The Sweetened Tea is HIGHLY Addictive!!!  Got the Caniac Meal $8.29 + Tax (6 Chicken Fingers, Crinkle Fries, Coleslaw, Texas Toast, & Large Drink)"}
{"text":"I understand you charge for extra \"sauce\" which is all you provide outside of ketchup but when one pays for the extras, you should actually provide them. Ordered 4, got 1.  Basic math people."}
{"text":"This canes has thee worst customer service.... Every single time i go here someone is rolling there eyes or giving attitude. If you dont like people find a new job!"}
{"text":"The girl who served me, Jasmine was not friendly at all. My 6pc order 2 go was not good, the fries were ice cold, tgat spoonful of cokeslaw,was horrible, the sauce was full of salt. The best thing was the bread & tea. They charge extra 4 lemonade, plz.  Where's kentucky?"}
{"text":"Excellent location. Great staff. Very clean. But above all April was very attentive to service she really did go above and beyond and made our experience a lot memorable."}
{"text":"Hours are till 1am, everyday, but I pulled up at 11:15 pm on a Tuesday and the drive thru was blocked off, the doors were locked, but all the lights inside were on? I've always had great service and great food but this was kinda a bummer after a long shift looking forward to Canes for dinner."}
{"text":"Love this location  Absolutely love the customer service which is amazing.The manager is very nice and always welcoming! The food is top quality and the best in the business! Toast,secret sauce, and freshly squeezed lemonade is heavenly!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from los Angeles just to get Canes only to find out they are closed. So sad, got a bump on my tongue and everything. Leaving tomorrow, can't wait till they open! Texas toast is the best, the chicken is great, slaw not a fan and the Lemonade is great! Open, Open, OPEN ALREADY! and no Chris G it's not the only reason I visit you, it's a big part but......lol"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time ever. Didn't know what to expect. There menu is simple and reminds of an In-&-Out menu which was a plus. The chicken was great but there is definitely better quality out there. There sauce they have is what I possibly think makes their chicken better. Not a big fan of their fries. The bread is personally my favorite part, it evens out the taste of the chicken and sauce. There are better chicken places but definitely worse. Overall, I enjoyed my meal here and will be back!"}
{"text":"Canes chicken is top 2 on my fast food chicken list. Great and delicious meal box the perfect size for about 7 bucks including a drink . Wish the cole slaw was larger. Yummm"}
{"text":"The food is delicious!!! They had good service, the restrooms were clean, everything was perfect. Will definitely come again. Really like this place!"}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers ever. The crispy outside is flavorful, and the chicken on the inside is tasty and moist. Not only are the fingers good, but the rest of the meal is just as amazing. The combination of fries and lightly toasted bread paired with the canes sauce is heaven in your mouth. Now the drink-- I am in love with their sweet tea, but if you don't like your tea super sweet, then I don't recommend it. And just as the icing on the cake, the service is friendly and even came around to ask how we were doing. Not too shabby for a \"fast food\" joint. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Chicken Strips that taste like real chicken. At first, you wonder, how come they taste funny? but that's because that is what chicken taste like! They are not over salted with pretend chicken extracts and MSG flavor, and are fried nice and crispy.  I normally don't touch french fries; but the sauce made them edible! (that is a HUGE deal!)  I'm very impressed by this place, good job Raising Cane's!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating in raising canes. There chicken strips are so good and there cane's sauce are totally delicious. So if you love chicken strips this the place for you"}
{"text":"I was never an avid chicken finger enthusiest.......until I moved to Vegas and discovered Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers!    What more is there to say?  The chicken is cooked to perfection.  The breading is light and crispy, not heavy and hard like others I've tried.    Another plus.....crinkle cut fries!   May not sound like a huge deal, but I've found that the crinkles in the fries increases the surface area which allows them to carry copious amounts of ketchup.....I like ketchup.  The toast was good too!  The downside of the meal was the slaw....but I'm not a fan of slaw anyways.  I come here at least twice a week, and do not see any reason to stop."}
{"text":"Customer service was great! Raising Canes seems like they train their staff exceptionally well. For being a new location you can always expect a few glitches but our visit was great. Our food was on point and delicious. It was a great first impression. Keep up the good work Canes"}
{"text":"Chicken strips were delicious! Fresh, crunchy, non greasy, & hot! Sauce was light & tasty. Fries were great! Not too salty, little crunch on outside & soft inside. Cool environment, completely friendly & attentive. Great first experience. Staff came to check on us an was knowledgeable about food."}
{"text":"First time at cane's.  it's great, like a better KFC, good chicken, Texas toast and that sauce. Not sure what's in it and I'm sure it's a secret but really good. Glad they give you A little container and don't have it in a dispenser otherwise I'd probably fill my purse with it"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and both times I've been pleasantly surprised by how *good* it is. I'm not normally a fan of fast food, but their chicken tastes and looks like real chicken, as opposed to some other fast food restaurants. The chicken strips, fries, and Texas toast are all very yummy.   Their staff is also very friendly and fun. The last time we drove through, one of the staff members was changing the trash bag in a trash can in our sight. She waved at us with a big smile on her face and did a funny little dance, which brought a smile to my face!"}
{"text":"Our first time visiting raising canes in Las Vegas was a success! A server told us that this was the place to try so we took a taxi cab all the way from our hotel. They only have one thing, chicken fingers! They are to die for we stopped a second time on the way to the airport! There was an employee named Stephanie, young girl was so sweet she gave us a free coupon just because it was our first time and we wouldn't get it for a while. So good so tummy, dreaming about it now!"}
{"text":"What can i say...WE LOVE CANES! This location is great with service and cleanliness. ..always fast and friendly.  The manager Mike, always makes us and our family feel welcome."}
{"text":"We have been 100% happy every time we have eaten here. It is always fresh and hot! The chicken is so juicy, the fries are awesome, and the toast is wicked good!  We love the 3 and 4 box combos and have had them many times.  We will definitely continue to be regulars!"}
{"text":"Having lived on the East coast, I was used to Chick-fil-A and thought that it was the best place to get chicken...but boy was I wrong!! After moving here and hearing that Cane's was the best place to get chicken fingers, I just had to try it. I can now say, hands down, that this is the BEST fast food restaurant I've ever been to!  This location has always been clean, I've had fantastic customer service every single time, and the food has been absolutely delicious!! Usually I like parts of a meal more than the other, but between the chicken, fries, and texas toast I can't choose which one I like most!   I'm surprised that Cane's doesn't have 5 stars, I'm not sure what more you could ask from a restaurant! I've yet to have anything less than an awesome experience. The prices are decent as well, and with how often I like to eat here now, I had to sign up for the Caniac card!   (The UNLV student discount is also a great little bonus!!)"}
{"text":"Caniac Combo is! Texas toast butter on both sides and crinkle fries with the cane sauce hits the spot every time. This location always serves it up hot and fresh."}
{"text":"For some reason this Canes just taste better than all the Canes, like its really amazing! But anyways, I really only like Canes because of the sauce and the bread. The chicken actually has no flavor by itself and the fries get all soggy in the box, but that freakin sauce makes you forget all of that!"}
{"text":"I would give it 5 stars.. but I've been going to canes for a few years. Canes still tastes good. But the chicken is smaller. Its also not as crispy and tasty as it used to be. But still bomb though"}
{"text":"The most delicious chicken fingers ever. The sauce that comes with them is amazing. The fries are only ok, but who cares about fries when you are eating these chicken fingers. I love how after you order they brought our food to the table. Great service. And yes, how could I forget the toast that comes with the meal, so good! The drinks came with crushed ice and I loved that."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I go every now and then, only because when I do, I lose all control. Couple extra toasts? SURE! Add some extra sauces? WHY NOT!?  If you have never been to Raising Canes and you are a human that enjoys things that are fried, you are missing out!!!! Their chicken fingers are like no other with their perfect, slightly heavy breading, which I very much love. The flavor is spot on.  Most people dip their chicken in that addictive sauce, but I dip everything that I have in the sauce. Fries, toast, my fork. It's peppery and so flippin good! I could do shots of that sauce.  I've never had any issues with their service and on the few occasions they left something off, they always bring it right out with no questions.  If you drive by and see 120 cars in the drive thru, just know that it's worth it. Love this place.  Did I mention you can eat a good size meal for under $10? WIN!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I discovered it a few months ago and wished I had found it years ago!  I don't really care for the Toast.  I guess it's a southern thing, but the Chix fingers and fries are great and the Fry Sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"I have never had a problem before. Then one night they had given me the wrong order. I called them and they apologized and told me to come back with receipt. When I went back the manager again apologized, and told me he would get another order ready. It was out within 3 minutes! I was Very impressed with how the manager handled the situation! They seemed genuinely sorry and made sure that the problem was corrected! I understand mistakes happen and I thank that manager again!"}
{"text":"The service and atmospheres usually SO amazing. But the Lady Manager is absolutely horrible to her employees."}
{"text":"I saw Danny Devito doing coke in the bathroom here. It was pretty damn good as he offered me some too. Also the chicken was off da damn chain!!"}
{"text":"Honestly when I first heard about this place a couple years ago, I thought 'seriously? A place that only serves chicken fingers?..' Now I come here all the time because it's SOOOO GOOD!"}
{"text":"This is the most frustrating review for me so far. I attended the original Raising Cane's in Baton Rouge, LA, many times and I have visited several others. Unfortunately if I am comparing this location to the other locations than 2 stars is a stretch.   The sauce was good but for some reason seemed to taste different than the sauces at other locations.  The chicken was awful. I bought the Caniac, which is 6 pieces, and 4 of the 6 pieces were stale and hard to chew. I was there around 11am so there is no excuse for stale food.  The bread was also stale and very bland.  However, the sweet tea was great. Since it is so hard to get quality sweet tea here in Arizona I was pleased to find it was as good as Louisiana sweet tea. I thought it was a 5, which made the experience a 2 for me."}
{"text":"Fresh Cane's...Fingers, Fries plus Cole Slaw and \"squeezed\" lemonade. Tasty munch on a Friday night. An ambitious and jolly crew in here. Pretty quick service, didn't have to wait very long at all."}
{"text":"The upside: Chicken, texas toast, fries, and secret sauce  The downside: Not being able to find a place to sit especially around lunch time"}
{"text":"Way better then the kfc and popeyes greasy and dry ones...my favorite chicken tenders with that really tasty sauce...the toast is really good and buttery. ..idont even like coleslaw but there's is good enough to eat ...the fries go great with the tenders and the lemonade is the best ive tried from a fast food restaurant,  made with cane suger which makes it taste amazing apparently . if you love tenders this is your place to go."}
{"text":"At times the wait is indeed a WAIT! But we Love this place loads of fries chicken is pure white meat not oily and tastes great for fast food fried chicken tenders! New one on Val Vista we waited in drive thru for 20minutes!!!!! Their was only 3 cars... I was frustrated but when we received our food we were happy and forgot all about the WAIT!"}
{"text":"ok ... it could be the southern in me ... but I LOVE Cane's. It tastes like good old fashioned fried chicken and they serve it with this bomb -ass sauce. ( yes i said bomb-ass) .  It is a tangy and savory sauce that you have to eat with everything... including the crinkle cut fries... and texas toast ... (omg the Texas Toast)  I swear i gain like 5 lbs just talking about this place. I typically get the three finger deal which is awesome and I either get a sweet tea- OR  Lemonade ... because OMGOSH soooooo good.  hmmm I wonder if I should go for lunch."}
{"text":"I loved Raising Cane's! The service was great. The staff was  friendly  and very  efficient! Shout out to Destiny for great service."}
{"text":"Cane's Rocks!!!!  My family and I eat here at least once a week and it is consistently wonderful.  The employees are usually younger, college or high school kids who seem to actually love their jobs.  Great energy, great food.  The dipping sauce is fantastic.  Get the toast buttered and toasted on both sides, makes all the difference in the world...and of course dip it in the secret sauce!  Love the fries.  Always perfectly cooked so they aren't crispy or soggy.  Just right.  Even my picky little eaters (ages 1.5 and 3) will devour Cane's."}
{"text":"First time ever today. When I walked in the place looked like a 80's dance club with the mix of your average diner. The chicken is what makes this place Canes. I mean seriously, they got some MEAN chicken. The cashier was very nice and inspirational. This place is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who likes chicken. Which is basically everyone."}
{"text":"Very simple menu.  Chicken fingers, slaw, fries and Texas toast. Very impressed. It was delicious. They charge extra for the lemonade.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I went to my car, downloaded Yelp, and created an account... Just so I could write about how awesome of a manager Austin was.  He was very helpful, cheerful, and you could tell he loved his job. It's very refreshing to see these people working in the service industry, so keep up the great work! I will be back because of him :)"}
{"text":"my only complaint is that they need to make their to go packaging different.  I dont come here unless im dining in, in the take out boxes, the chicken and fries get soggy.  I love their food and their tea!  The service is great at this location too!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I LOVE Raising Cane's in the New Orleans area. I used to travel to that area a lot for work. When I found out there was a Raising Cane's in Vegas I made sure to fit it into our schedule while we were there.  Unfortunately this location lacks the greatness of the other locations I've visited. How do you mess up fried chicken you may be wondering. I'm not really sure how they do it but they certainly managed to. The flavor was not on par at all. It tasted weird honestly.   To put the nail in the coffin the bathroom was absolutely disgusting. There was a used female product on the floor. I will never be back to this location."}
{"text":"No flavor chicken fingers. The fries are kinda Ore-Ida busch league. I'm not into carb gorging, so I didn't eat the texas toast. Here's what really got my goat, only 2 sauces! You heard me right, just honey mustard and gross 'Cane's Special Sauce' (and they charge extra for them). How in the flying f#%&* do you open up 'Chicken Finger' franchises and NOT have Ranch, BBQ, or hot sauce?!?! That has to be the most moronic, piss-poor decision in the history of American fast food."}
{"text":"Tasty, fast service and friendly! I have yet to be disappointed by this place and they have catered large parties for my company meetings!"}
{"text":"Awesome chicken with even better Cane sauce. Fries are tasty but eat them quick as once cold they loose their tastiness. Garlic bread is also very good.   If you like lemonade be sure to try theirs.  Place can be quite noisy but they clear the tables pretty quick and there's always napkins, forks, straws, ketchup up by the main counter."}
{"text":"I've been to several of the Cane's restaurants, this one is the closest to my house and is convenient for when I'm in this neighborhood.  Seems the word has gotten out about it as it's pretty much always packed and I have a hard time finding a parking spot when coming here during peak lunch time.  The chicken fingers are awesome and taste excellent.  The sauce that comes with the chicken is delicious and I usually end up using it on everything - chicken, bread, and fries.  I would highly recommend this place but have to warn that parking might be a problem if you come when it's busy."}
{"text":"Raising Canes is terrific!  I came there twice in two days to show my buddies what they were missing. The guy working there was very friendly and very helpful. He even recognized me when I went in the second time. They really want to make you feel welcome and at home.  Now on to the food: The food is awesome. Chicken has always be crispy, hot and fresh. Coleslaw is great. The crinkle cut fries are hot and crispy and  only good if you dine in. They will get lukewarm and weird if you do take away. The Texas toast is great. It should be toasted a little longer to get more crunch but the taste makes up for it. Also, the fresh squeezed lemonade is great but they charge about 20 cents extra for it and you have to pay for refills, which I hate doing. Other than the minor flaws, this place deserves a 5 star rating. Very pleased every time I come in."}
{"text":"Automatic paper towel dispenser was very generous. Gave me like 3 feet of paper towel. I've never used an automatic paper towel dispenser that didn't make me swipe 3 times to get enough to actually dry my hands. 5 stars. Food and service are good, too."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about raising canes!!! The food always fresh and hot,ready to go and eat. Most of all my favorite part is the sauce!! You can dip the fries,chicken strips, and even the Texas toast. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I came to Raising Cane's for a quick lunch on the go. I hate eating in my car but...so be it. I ordered the Three Finger Combo: 3 chicken fingers, fries, Texas toast, sauce and a drink. The chicken fingers were huge, but they were also the most tender, juicy, well cooked chicken fingers I have ever had from a food establishment with a drive through window. The sauce was TDF! I was super satisfied with my choice to eat here and I will definitely come back.   I don't have kids yet...but I just had a though: Raising Cane's chicken finger quality FAR exceeds any other fast food place, and I would ACTUALLY feed my young kids these chicken fingers...as opposed to the other \"mcmystery chicken\" places out there."}
{"text":"Love this Canes!  One of my favorites!  The floorplan is so open and not cluttered at all.  Its in a great party of town and by a lot of shopping. It's usually never too busy that theres a line and the staff is always very friendly.  And of course the food is perfect."}
{"text":"I already love Cane's but the Cane's on Rainbow is always so clean and the employees are always genuinely welcoming. Kaylee is the friendliest employee. I watched her clean the whole lobby the whole time I was there. She even took our trays when we were done! She provides excellent service and I hope she is appreciated!"}
{"text":"This place is a must if you are coming to vegas. There sauce is what makes the chicken n the bread taste so good.. Cane's is so addicting for me I love it"}
{"text":"Okay first i come to canes all the time they mess up on a few orders of mine but they all ways fix it when It happens but I went there and ordered a box combo that is 4 fingers and instead or chicken fingers for some reason I has 2 little chicken nugget things so I called as always when they mess up so they can fix it and it was already about 11 when I got home so I didn't want to drive back up there so I called and I talked to Mike the manger and he ask me for my name and phone number so when I go in they can replace my order for me next time which is fine. So I get there talked Mike and he tells me I need the receipt but all the other times they have mess up on my order they never asked for one before. So I asked him so why did you ask for my phone number and name and he said just because then I told him no other manger had asked for one before he just told me to have a good day. For a customer that goes there all the time that's kind of mess up considering that there the ones who messed up not me. So I go to My car and sit there and think I should atleast say something so I go back in I was very nice I didn't yell or cuss and I just told him that all the other time they had no problem taking it and I let him know that he didn't make me aware at the time I called to keep the receipt so after going back and forth with him I finally decided to give me the box. I shouldn't of had to go Through all this for that."}
{"text":"3 stars. This is why:  1. Not enough french fries. They are good but you have to eat them right away. Do  not let them get cold.   2. Grill the toast on both sides.   3. Coleslaw was a little mediocre. Needs more tang and flavor  4 The fingers were moist and flavorful but they were not as big as the commercials portrayed them. Very fresh. I agree  5. Canes sauce?? - I am on the fence on this one. I do not love it but I do not hate it  at the same time. Really weird.   I expected a lot form this place.  I will try it again sometime."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of fast-food, I make an exception for In-N-out, because it's not really fast food if they make it fresh to order without freezers and heat lamps.  I always assumed Cane's was like KFC. I was still hestitant after my husband insisted it wasn't. After much reluctance I finally gave it a try.  Shhh! I liked it. Yep, that's the truth. In-N-out is no longer alone. I had the three finger combo. The chicken was all white meat lightly breaded and fried crisp. It was not greasy, just crisp on the outside and juicy inside. I enjoyed the peppery-ness of the sauce, but I was missing smoke flavor. I suppose I'm too used to BBQ sauce. Still, tasty, however.  Even the sides were good. The crinkle fries were crisp and fluffy in the center, just the way I like them. The Texas toast was fresh and light, with a brush of butter and garlic. Yum."}
{"text":"Great chicken, toast & sauce  The fries leave a lot to be desired Pricey for what you get"}
{"text":"I'm so impressed with this location, it happens to be near my house, so very convenient to stop in.  I've been 5 or 6 times and I have to admit, I'm blown away by the consistent great food, top-of-the-line service and cleanliness of the place.  The manager, Megan, made a point to remember my first name.  Her crew are the most attentive, polite and active group I have ever seen at a restaurant.  They open the door for you, get you a drink refill, remove your basket away when your finished.  The chicken is fantastic EVERYTIME which is hard to do.  I am now a believer in Cane's and this manager.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We LOVE the food here.  But the place always has the music up way too loud and conversations revert to almost yelling.  Spoke with the manager and district manager (he happened to be there).  They said this is Canes policy to have it loud and they would get 'written up'  if they changed it. Owner wants it lively and fun.  Guess we will just use drive thru like most people were doing or find a happy place with reasonable level of sound."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and wondered how good can chicken tenders really be. They were delicious. Even though I was full, I had to finish them, because the thought of letting them get cold just sounded like a waste."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Food is awesome and the service is even better! They bring out your food and will come by and throw it away when you are done! The ice is phenomenal (little nuggets you can chew on). I can't say enough about this place. I wish I could buy a franchise!"}
{"text":"Finally Cane's has a location right by my house that I can walk to. I've been here about 5 times since they've opened and haven't been disappointed yet. Have both dined in and ordered through drive through. Place is clean and service is good. Always quite a bit of people dining when I come in. Food is fresh and delicious. No complaints here! Also be sure to sign up for the Caniac's Club. You get points on every one of your purchases which leads to you getting free grub in the future!!"}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers in town. However, do not go in at lunch time. They told me to park on the front and it took forever to get the food (19 minutes to be exact) if you can look past that, it's the best place in town."}
{"text":"It's tasty chicken and tangy secret sauce with a good helping of slaw and Texas toast I don't know what you expect but this place is delicious"}
{"text":"Every time we come through Vegas we have to stop at Raising Cane's! It is the best, juiciest chicken fingers I have ever had and I don't usually like chicken fingers. I can't have chicken fingers anywhere else, nothing adds up! Also, it's affordable and so filling. The staff is great as well. Never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great chicken fingers.. Simply delicious! Maybe the best food value in Vegas! The place was clean, people looked like they were more than satisfied with their food, and in the 45 minutes we were in the restaurant, two NBA Players stopped in for food, meaning the food was good enough to risk being mobbed by fans! That says a lot about Raising Cane's! I'll definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken strips. Fresh white meat chicken coated with flour batter, fried to a crispy perfection. Dip the strip into the original cane sauce and you've got one heck of a meal.  I ordered the Caniac combo which comes with 6 strips. The cole slaw is just ok. Fries are good. Texas toast is buttery and large. But the stars of the show are definitely those hot, crispy strips!  Place was clean and service was very friendly. I ate at a location in Dallas last year with my brother and was equally impressed there as well. Seems like a good franchise."}
{"text":"We were out driving around looking for a place for lunch. We saw the sign for Raising Cane's and had never heard of it. The amount of cars in the parking lot and the line for the drive up window brought us to try it. We were not disappointed at all. The energy  of the staff was a pleasure to see. We had the GM and other managers stop by to make sure everything was good. We loved the crispy coating on the chicken. We will go back again very soon. Yes it may be \"fast food\" but it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I think you cornered the market on chicken fingers. Like I always say, find something you're good at and stick to it."}
{"text":"As far as chicken fingers go, this is the best place to get them at. Although there isn't much of a selection, the food they offer is great quality. And of course the sauce is one of the best parts of the meal. I generally get the Caniac and share it with my girlfriend, and its quite filling, with 6 fairly large chicken fingers, texas toast, fries, cane sauce and cole slaw.  Service was good and friendly, and the food, although made to order, didn't take that long to receive at all.  Also, if you join the Caniac club, you can get a free box combo as well:   http://www.raisingcanes.com/club/index.html"}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers ever!  I also love their freshly brewed tea- it comes as sweetened or unsweetened. Not really a \"fast food\" joint that you stereotypically expect because I consider the quality of the food at the same level of In-N-Out.  I take all my friends who come to visit here.   I guess we have at least one thing over california!"}
{"text":"Canes would honestly be a 5 star if only they weren't too stingy about giving out hot sauce.. Definitely not a place to go to if you're on a diet because there is not one healthy or somewhat healthy option on the menu BUT by far they have some of the best chicken strips I have ever had and I'm very picky. The customer service is always great. I have never had a problem."}
{"text":"tl;dr: Consistency!!!! This is why CANES is amazing. I have tried 4 locations, and always find myself back here. This Phoenix store constantly delivers fresh and hot orders! The staff are jovial and it is not as busy as the ASU Canes.  Credibility: 100+ visits in my 5 years of living in the valley. My obsession with Canes started since they opened their Tempe store.   Less is More: The menu is obviously limited and this is beautiful. We don't need a clutter of choices and Canes makes life easier for us. Only question you should be asking is, \"do I want coleslaw or an extra piece of toast\" (standard comes with the slaw)  My standard order: The box, sub the slaw for toast, then inhale this order and regret not having more sauce.   Mostly Irrelevant fun fact: If you do the drive through route you will be graced by an awesome customized greeting!  PS: I still order chicken strips off the kids menu."}
{"text":"First time at this place during our stay in Las Vegas. This place was great. Food was fresh. Didn't seem to be sitting under a heat lamp type of fast good place. Their chicken strips were better than other chicken places I've been to. The cane sauce was definitely as describe by my friends, crack. It was definitely good. Hard to describe what it tasted like but it was addicting. The drive through service was great. The person working the drive thru had a great sense of humor and was very friendly. See you soon Raising Canes! Well definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a new location and i understand it takes people a few days or weeks to get used to the new establishment. But, I think the staff should of been trained better in taking custom orders.  I went here because its close to home in Anthem. And i was happy to see it open!!  Well that soon turned to despair. I Usually hit up the location on Las Vegas Blvd near the outlet mall and they are spot on with everything. Now i will admit i don't order the run off the mill combos from the menu.  I Ordered a Caniac Combo No Slaw Extra Toast Butter both Sides with a Sweet Tea NO ICE. The Girl on the intercom seemed confused. She replied what was that? I repeated the order to her. She said ok thank you i will tell them no ice. Great im thinking they got it.  Pulled up to the payment window gave the girl my money and canes clubcard, she seemed nice but failed to return my clubcard. I didnt realize till i had already pulled up.  Got to the pickup window and the lady was like 2, 3 piece combos? UH No LOL she asked ok what did you have? LOL ok at this point im like wow these people are idiots, So i just hand her the receipt  4 Minutes later she has my order. First she hands me a sweet tea packed full of ice when i specifically said no ice. Then she says she will strain it for me..?? STRAIN it for me? How about dump out the whole cup and refill it. What are you straining it with your hand?? So we get the food and i have to go back into the store to reclaim my canes club card.  Just wow never had such an ordeal at raising canes. But after all of that the food was delicious and cooked perfectly. The cooks are doing a great job!! The butter both sides was perfect :)"}
{"text":"Raising Canes is one of the best fried chicken places there is. The service here is great and the Sweet Ice Tea is to die for.  Even if you dislike Sweet Tea you must try the tea before you judge it."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to this location. The first two times, my only complaint was that it was WAY TOO LOUD in there. The music being turned up forces everybody else to scream at each other. Before you know it, it's a headache with a side of chicken.  One EXTREMELY good thing is that they clean CONSTANTLY. The lobby never lacks for attention and they clean, clean, clean, behind their customers. Nothing more annoying that trying to find a seat only to see dirty tables. Not at Cane's. Also, whoever trains these kids knows their business. They are positive and professional. Very nice.  The food - Let's be honest, it's fast food. So, people need to temper their expectations with a little reality. Having said that, I like Raising Cane's. I wish they had barbecue sauce, but I can live without it. I like their fries and I like their chicken. I am quickly becoming a \"Caniac Combo\" dude.  Why the two stars? Well, this visit the chicken tasted of burnt grease. Really REALLY bad! I've worked around enough restaurants (and Lord knows I've eaten in enough) to know when the grease hasn't been changed in the fryer. This is a rookie mistake and frankly, ruined my entire meal. Gross, gross, gross. Now, because of how meticulous these guys are about so many things, this was probably a one-time oversight. So, I'll be back. If they fix it - I'll adjust my review. If they don't -  this guy is getting his money back. Period.  Please fix this. I like this place."}
{"text":"Zoey & Phillip was so awesome ! They had no problem with changing our order at the last minute"}
{"text":"I'm almost always impressed by many of the employees here. I always crack up at the drive-thru when whoever is taking orders is brave enough to do one of their little sayings. The food is always hot and fresh, and I have to say, I love their chicken. Always tender. Anyone who doesn't like it here must either just not like classic chicken or they have been eating way too many fancy chicken dishes. This is simple, to the point, easy, and delicious! Also, I can't get enough of their Sweet Tea, but that may just be the country girl in me. Keep up the good work, guys!"}
{"text":"So for tonight's dinner, we had Cane's Chicken Fingers again. It was delicious once again. After leaving Town Square, grandma, Lil sis, and I did some shopping and were trying to figure out what to eat for dinner. Grandma said \"What about Cane's?\" And I said, Hell Yeah. From there, we were driving on South bound Las Vegas Blvd toward the Las Vegas Outlet. As we approached Cane's, the drive thru was long, therefore, we decided we were gonna go in. We ordered a tail gate of 25 pieces of chicken for $23 plus 8 personal sized containers of the Cane's sauce, a pan of fries for $7.59, some individual coleslaws that were a dollar something, and three large lemonades. The total was about $44. The food was once again scrumptious and was washed down by the lemonade. It was um um um good."}
{"text":"Totally amazing. Best fast food chicken I've ever had by far. Great, cheerful staff. Quality food. Awesome place. I'd definitely work here for a first job"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Raising Canes for a few months now and service has always been great and friendly. Food is always fresh and hot. Never disapointed and neither will you. By the way do not leave here without trying the sweet tea. Its the best!"}
{"text":"Chicken fingers was good crinkle fries a bit on the thin and dry side. Could use a bit more of a selection of sauces.. like ranch or barbecue sauce.  Great service"}
{"text":"Long story short... They were the best chicken fingers in town, until yesterday me and my boyfriend had it and now neither of us aren't feeling to well... I don't think I'll be back, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Love the simple menu (chicken fingers, fries, toast) the special sauce is the PREFECT dipping sauce for the meal. I enjoy this place for a little more than the casual fast food."}
{"text":"This place didn't live up to the hype that I was hearing. People from around here was saying this place is great! amazing! delicious! It was decent for chicken fingers and fries. The chicken fingers were ok, the sauce it comes with was pretty good tho. The toast they give you is actually pretty good too, and the fries are the crinkly ones, not bad. Their sweet tea was delicious. I probably won't come back for a while, not really craving it."}
{"text":"Shaun? Sean? Shawn? Idk how you spell it but it was his first day today and he did a SPECTACULAR job cleaning off our table. Very friendly lad. 10/10 would recommend if you want to have your table cleaned and some chicken. Promote this guy."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing special.  Their \"signature\" chicken fingers are OK but seriously bland...Chick-Fil-A is far better and so is KFC and even Carl's Jr.  It's hard to see how they compete with such mediocre offerings.  We tried the Box combo with Texas toast, cole slaw, fries and 4 fingers for $6.79.  I would have hoped their breading/batter was tastier or even spicier...anything to add more flavor."}
{"text":"Let it be known that a young female employee with red curly hair who was working on Saturday, March 4, did not wash her hands after exiting the restroom stall when I visited between 3:00 and 3:30pm.  Tip: Just because someone is facing away from the stall and facing toward the sink... doesn't mean they can't see you with their peripheral vision or by simply turning their head.  THEN... I noticed she went not to the cashier area (could be forgiven if she wasn't working with food, I guess) but to the area back with all the food.  Ew."}
{"text":"I loooveeee the chicken...the food is never the issue!   Tonight we arrived at 11pm sharp.. Went through the drive thru and Tiana took our order and repeated it back. We got to the window and she repeated the order...incorrectly. We corrected it, waited..she handed us our Arnold Palmers and we realized they were regular sized. Tonight we asked for larges..no biggie, right! We mentioned it so she could correct her mistake yet again..still no biggie UNTIL this girl really had the nerveeee to get an attitude even after I paid the difference gladly. Like excuse the hell outta me but we corrected you 3 times politely with NO GRIEF and you felt the need to huff and puff??? I'm literally writing this before eating my food she was so rude. I hope you find a job in a stock room away from the busy bowels of canes!  Keep make fabulous chicken though!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great chicken fingers and Bread. However charging for lemonade is nonsense and they need to get some ranch and BBQ sauce. Otherwise some of the best chicken fingers around."}
{"text":"If you're into chicken, go to a Popeye's and forget this place.  Chicken is mediocre at best.  The accoustics in this place are terrible.  The place is so loud, you can't think."}
{"text":"Limited menu of just chicken, but so tasty. I hope they open one in Iowa before I die."}
{"text":"Really? Two suggestions since I did not give 5 stars: 1. Don't make the employees yell out someones name once their order is ready. This place is always busy and who can hear there name when it is busy or a little busy. The employee looks confused and unwilling to yell over people trying to enjoy their meal. Upper management, really? Have you sat in this store when it is busy and just watch. By giving someone a number or sign to put on the table will eliminate the confusion and allow more time to the employee to clean up the soda area or provide service to more customers.  2. Your going to charge more for more sauce when the customer asks? In and out doesn't charge more, which leaves me as the customer with a more positive experience.  Other than that we love what Canes stands for and their food but believe they have room to improve and grow. The price and meal size will keep us around for now. We go about 3 times a month at the Tempe location."}
{"text":"WHAT I HAD: A MEAL that included: 6 chicken fingers, cole slaw, fries, and sweet tea...  The chicken is (I THINK) cooked in peanut oil. The taste reminded me of Chic-Fil-A, which is great because there isn't a Chic-Fil-A in Las Vegas so this is as close as you can get. The overall taste was good but I could feel the greasiness of it sinking to the pit of my stomach. I am almost sure that if you ate a ton of these chicken fingers you'd get a sick feeling.  The fries were those classic crinkle cut \"Ore Ida\" fries you'd see in the grocery store's frozen food section. The fact that they were crispy and that they gave me so much of them was a plus. There were so many fries that it was the only thing on the plate that I couldn't finish.  The coleslaw was the only thing I was dissapointed in. It was rather dry and they give you a little cup of it. Cole slaw is cheap to make so I don't understand why they would give you a hug pile of fries enough to feed 3-4 people... but then give you this little itty bitty cup of coleslaw... plus there was no real tang to it. Some restaurants will add some type of pineapple juice to their coleslaw to give it a sweet tang whereas Raising Cane's is just bland.  The sweet tea: I cherish these guys for being one of about 3 or 4 restaurants in the Vegas valley that ACTUALLY has sweet tea.  I think it was about $8 or $9 for my meal, which seems pretty pricey, but the amount of fries they give you makes up for that I guess  The sauce they use is good, but to be honest I've had way better sauces with chicken fingers elsewhere and I'm more of a honey mustard type of guy. - If they could get the honey mustard that Outback Steakhouse uses on it's \"Alice Springs Chicken\" this place would be killer  The ambiance: This place is usually always PACKED from what I see. My daughter and I literally got the only table available. It has a modern \"cool\" factor because they have Spiderman 3 and other \"modern\" movie posters on the wall. I get what they're trying to do here. Their trying to appeal to the younger crowd by putting up posters of recent movies. This seems really pretentious to a 32 year old guy like me though.  Beware of douche bags coming in and out of this place! When we were there there was this loud and obnoxious group of 30-40 year old guys all dressed in cheap suits without the jacket... I kid you not, they all left at the same time and they were holding these \"Free Hugs\" posters they made themselves with a sharpie. Sunday weirdos."}
{"text":"The service here is definitely \"wow\" ! All the employees here are always so sweet and happy and aside from the food being amazing, it's really the service that really makes you want to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"01 Jun 2014, 12:00p  Was looking for something quick to eat, but didn't want to go to any of the fast food chains we have here in LA.  I decided to check out Raising Cane's since it got good Yelp reviews.  Not having paid much attention, I realized after I entered that it's a chicken strips place.  Not really knowing what was best, I decided to order their most popular meal:  The Box Combo  I wasn't quite sure what Cane's Sauce was so I was game and decided to try it.  Had to get Sweet Tea with my combo and a little taste of the South that I like to indulge in when I can.  My order was to go and I dove right in after returning to my hotel.  The chicken strips were a little different than what I would expect from a fast food place, even a diner-like restaurant such as Denny's.  I could immediately tell these were white-meat pieces of chicken.  The batter wasn't anything special, but I appreciate the fact that they don't use formed chicken.  The fries were crinkle-cut which is also different from any other fast food place I've tried.  The Texas toast was probably the best part of the combo.  It was very soft inside and just slightly toasted enough to create a \"skin\".  The cole slaw was pretty good, too.  Needless to say, I pretty much devoured the entire meal as I was fairly hungry.  The sweet tea was just sweet enough, but not overly so.  I would make a trip back to try some of the other combos, but as with most other fast food, I would probably choose a healthier place like Subway first.  The staff was incredibly friendly, though!"}
{"text":"I love their chicken.  It is always the same and taste great. They serve crinkle cut french fries with it. Their special sauce tastes great and I use it to dip my french fries as well.  Good sweet tea.  Many times its hard to find a seat in there. It is definitely worth the wait though because the chicken is amazing.  The only thing I notice is the portion for french fries aren't as big at this location as they are in other locations I've been to. If you are looking for good chicken and sweet tea this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"Excellent.  The chicken fingers are the best i have had, anywhere.  Lightly battered, crispy, hot, delicious.  The staff is warm and inviting, and they came around to check on us mid-meal. Nowhere else fast-casual do you feel so welcome.  Delicious, clean, lovely."}
{"text":"Hands down the 2nd best fast food meal I have every had (1st is In & Out Burger sorry!) This place blows chickfilet out of the water! The chicken was very fresh and tasty and the portion sizes were pretty huge as well! Store was very clean. Only complaint that it is very tight and cramped but they for sure packed them in at lunch time!"}
{"text":"The sauce is definitely the boss. My #1 rec for first timers is get the cane's box and make sure you sub out the coleslaw for another sauce. Other than that, very simple formula. Great chicken fingers and a delicious sauce. The sweet tea is the best out of all the fast food restaurants. Better than Chick-fil-a's."}
{"text":"The sauce is the boss and the chicken is ALWAYS kickin. Canes is such a great spot. First had it in their home state on Louisiana and was so excited to find that there are locations in Vegas. The service is always great. The sweet tea is a must. And theres nothing wrong with goin a little overboard and gettin a caniac! One recommendation, if your not high on coleslaw, with the box combo, you can change out the coleslaw for another Canes sauce."}
{"text":"Good service, I'm not a fan of Sweet Tea, but theirs were LEGIT. Not too sweet, not too sugary. Their chicken fingers were lightly breaded, the Texas toast were ON LOCK. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"We come here all the time and it is AMAZING. Never have we had a bad experience in a year and a half and it's been over 100 visits tbqh. The staff is fantastic and the management truly cares about their customers. A few months ago, my dear friend and I were visiting and she forgot her wallet. The manager comped her meal and it truly touched our hearts  We meant to review earlier - but when a place is as good as this, you just assume everybody knows. The food is exactly as advertised. Crispy, soft, moist, delicious chicken and sides that leave everyone wanting more. Don't get me wrong, this is a fast food restaurant, but it's the only one I ever go back to on a regular basis. It's that good. 5 stars, would give 6 if possible."}
{"text":"Who couldn't love Raising Canes...It's soooo good you may wanna get double of everything if you've never been here because you'll regret having to go through that drive thru twice."}
{"text":"Is it so hard to wipe the soda off the cup before you hand it to me? I bet they don't know how to wipe their own ass either."}
{"text":"Meh.  Chicken was warm, but not hot.  The glorified thousands island sauce wasn't worth the extra cost for an extra serving.  Never been here before, doubt I'll be here again."}
{"text":"Maybe it's cause I'm from the east coast but this chicken is the most tasteless chicken I have ever had, I tried it on two separate occasions cause figured the first time was a fluke, but both times food was bland soggy fries and bread on top of it all"}
{"text":"In all our canes experiences this one by I17 and Peoria was by far the BEST thanks too Carlos Rodriguez Rios! He has wonderful customer service skills and was the sweetest guy ever! Thanks for making our experience so amazing. Will definitely drive the extra miles for that experience again."}
{"text":"Always love this place, its easily accessible. Their chicken tenders are always made fresh, its always still very crispy and hot. Their batter is very flavorful and right amount of spice, not drowning in salt. The best part is, the chicken tenders are never ever oily. Fries are also amazing, AWESOME with the Cane sauce! My favorite is the texas toast! it's buttery fresh and a little sweet which you dont expect. Raising Cane's is great when youre on the go or when youre craving chicken fingers. Don't forget the Sweet Tea... Cane's can never go wrong."}
{"text":"This is not your regular chiken. The food here is amazing. Good service and good price. I was in Las Vegas for over a month and tried different places for food and this is the place I will miss."}
{"text":"Love the chicken and the sweet tea is amazing! The Canes sauce is everything!!! Been to this one many times fast service and very friendly. Will be back."}
{"text":"I have always come to this canes since it is so close to me and i have always received great customer service until tonight (02/04/18). I went around 12 AM and the cashier running the drive through (male with tattoos on his right arm) had the worst attitude ever. We said \"thank you\" after he gave us our receipt and he just slammed the window shut. Also, we asked for ketchup and he just said \"it's in the bag\" with the worse tone of voice ever. If you the working late or having customers then find a new job honestly. Again, I love coming to this location, but his attitude and poor customer service has definitely got to go."}
{"text":"I know I'm not a math wizard, but I'm sure you have to know how to count 3 to work there! I ordered a 3 piece combo, not 2"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrid!!! The chicken is like eating raw uncooked rubber. If I could give this place zero stars I would. There are also creepy people always hanging out around there asking people in the drive through lane if they can buy them food."}
{"text":"Fresh chicken, isn't  seasoned that great  (or at all for that  matter) but  you cant go wrong with deliciously buttered texas toast and good lemonade."}
{"text":"Good food, love their Texas toast! The sauce for the chicken is very good too. We have gone plenty of times and our food is always hot and delicious."}
{"text":"I love raising canes but this location is not really good. The staff would rather gossip about who's outside then ask the people waiting in line can I help you. Worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"Eat here all the time. Chicken great and they have the best sweet tea in the valley. I usually come on my lunch break, but today I came for dinner with my son. Big difference thou. It took almost 15 minutes to get our food in the afternoon compared to 5 durning lunch time."}
{"text":"this location has some pretty nice music for young whiper snappers. The cashier didn't smile very much and I found a stray hair at the drink station. awkward!! also spelled my name incorrectly  Not too shabby though."}
{"text":"PROS: The chicken is good, sauce is ok, crinkle-cut fries are good, the toast I can do without, don't like coleslaw so I can't comment about it.  CONS: The portions are small.  For the money, I'd rather have Church's.  Their portions are bigger and just as good."}
{"text":"Great chicken fingers, crinkle fries, Texas Toast and Caine's dipping sauce!  Very well ran restaurant that is clean and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today, and just hit the drive thru.  I hit the 3 finger box, since I didn't know if the place was any good or not. Surprisingly,  it was better than I guess I had expected it to be. The fingers were large - bigger than most chicken strip you get at most places. Whole white meat chicken, with a crisp and light breading. Everything tasted fresh to me and I will return again.   ALLERGY NOTE: Asked the manager what they fry in, and he said it was a blend of canola and vegetable oil. They do not use peanut oil at all, so according to him there is no worries for peanut allergy sufferers."}
{"text":"Not only was the food great but the service was outstanding. The manager was very good at his job, the food usually only takes 2-5 minutes to come out it was almost 10 and he came out to my table and talked to us and apologized, I was in no rush and wasn't complaining, and he still came out to let us know. You don't get that kind of service just anywhere."}
{"text":"This location is wonderful - and along with the best chicken fingers ever, I salute the great manager and great customer service.   On our way from Vegas to LA, we stopped at a different Cane's drive through (N Henderson).  Heading south-westward, my daughter discovered that they had handed us the wrong order.  We were missing SEVERAL items!  Finding this Cane's location up ahead, we explained the situation at the drive thru window, and the manager kindly added to our order what was missing -- plus an abundance of complimentary crinkle cut fries!  Such kindness deserves to be saluted! :)"}
{"text":"While in Vegas, my friends made a huge deal about this place saying that it was the best fried chicken in town. Our group was already on a fried chicken streak for the weekend, so we knew we had stop by this place before we left.   I got the chicken, fries, and toast meal, and immediately asked for condiments because I LOVE CONDIMENTS (at chik-fil-a I have at least 4 sauces on hand at all times) but they only had hot sauce and ketchup!! I was distraught and sat back down with a couple of hot sauce packets to try to salvage the meal. I guess my friends hyped this place up so much that I thought it would be the best meal of my life but it was actually extremely subpar? The Texas toast was good, but everything else was pretty average? Why wasn't there any ranch? Can't y'all make a house sauce or something???"}
{"text":"Wow, this place has the most exciting drive-thru I've ever been to!!  The staff makes every visit one to remember.  They are always having a good time and making jokes.  I love coming here just for the positive vibes!  The dining room is really nice and clean, too.  Now for the food, its great--they keep it simple like In n Out.  Their specialty is chicken tenders.  All the combos come with them.  My pick of the menu is The Box Combo with a large sweet tea.  The sweet tea will rock your socks off!  Oh and their chicken tender sauce is amazing!!  All in all, tasty food, excellent service; check it out!"}
{"text":"Tried this and was not disappointed.  Chicken fingers and fries are the house specialties."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this location numerous times. Haven't had a bad experience so far. We love it!"}
{"text":"I have just moved back to Las Vegas and swore that I would get out of my structured box and try new things so instead of going to Popeye's for chicken which I love, I tried Raising Canes which someone referrred me to.  In a nutshell, the chicken is not nearly as good as Popeyes not is the quantity the same.  That is the con of going there.  Is it bad?  No certainly not, I just think you can do better.  The service is very good and the people are very friendly.  The sweet Tea is as good as the Waffle House and Lucilles BBQ.  The Texas toast is great.  The coleslaw is better than KFC's."}
{"text":"Great chicken fingers! Sauce is delish and lemonade is the best."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. We spent our honeymoom in Vegas. In the summer. Loads of fun (and sweat. Ick). I'd managed to convince my new food-averse husby to try out this place. I'd heard stories. I'd even checked out Yelp. But why? What for? It's just not worth the price for barely flavored fried chicken strips and krinkle fries. I'm pretty sure I have the same exact types of chicken fingers and fries in my fridge. The sauce was the only thing with any flavor...and it had no kick. Very disappointing, but they do get a star for good customer service."}
{"text":"Food is great, popular place with the locals. I was not too big on a place that only serves chicken strips, but these have to be the tastiest strips I have ever had from a fast food place. The wait wasn't too bad and if you want to try new places you should drive by."}
{"text":"the food is good BUT the place could be cleaner.  We went a little after 12pm and all the trash cans in the place were full to the point that trash was spilling. If it wasn't that the place needed to be cleaner and my toast was cold I'd give it 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Stay away from this location.  The service is horrible.  The staff is cocky and rude. Also they cannot get an order right.  I went there last night ordered a the sandwich combo with no lettuce.  Easy right.  Nope.  Not only did it include lettuce. But they told just to take it off.  The manager was more interested in talking to some girl at the counter and the cashier was totally oblivious to the situation. Needless to say I rather drive to Utah and go to Zaxbys before I visit that place again."}
{"text":"Love love love it   Super juicy Love the Texas toast!! Lemonade is so refreshing Fast service  Great staff"}
{"text":"Yes, it's fast food. But it's the best at what it does. The breading is always super-crispy and the chicken always comes out fresh. The fries are on point, as is the Texas toast. The Cane's sauce is a take on the standard Thousand Island \"secret sauce,\" but a good one. It complements the chicken well, and is good on fries too. It's for sure greasy and I don't know how often a mere mortal could eat there, but I say that in the best possible way. I love Cane's and make a point of stopping by every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"LOVE Canes have been to multiple locations in the valley and as always this location was fantastic as the others,"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Canes. Everyone has always been very nice.  They always manage to keep the place clean even the bathrooms.   At their busiest you never have to wait very long.   Its great food at a reasonable price.  I can't comment on the fries since I always swap them out for an extra coleslaw."}
{"text":"Staff is fast and efficient. Parking lot isn't super convenient to get to but worth it for that cane sauce!"}
{"text":"What Is the big deal about this place? They are totally inept at customer service. I went through the drive-through ordered and then tried to pay with my debit card. Was told that they don't take debit. I could also hardly understand a word they were saying in the drive-through speaker. When I sent my daughter to go into pick up her order they were yelling and screaming at customers to pick up their orders. This place is a joke. Avoid."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the ORIGINAL Raising Cane's on the campus at LSU-Baton Rouge. Granted, it was 15 years ago when I was still a student. I've also eaten at the one in my hometown of Covington, LA. But today was my first day eating at a Canes outside of Louisiana, and all I can say is that it was A LIL' TASTE OF HOME! I relished the Cane's chicken, perfect fry batter, Cane's sauce, slaw, and Barq's rootbeer. BTW, Barq's originated in Biloxi, MS, which is on the Gulf Coast. The Texas toast is perfect, but I've never cared for their crinkle fries. They're pretty cheap. They taste like the Walmart \"True Value\" brand of crinkle fries. No joke. Other than that, I highly recommend Cane's. If you only eat three things, eat this: Barq's Rootbeer, slaw, and a lot of chicken with Cane's sauce. Southern people know how to eat!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a while now and we love it! The food is consistently great. The chicken is always hot and really tasty and the sauce is amazing. I love the lemonade and even though I haven't tried the sweet tea... I have been told its the best. The drive thru is usually pretty full but it goes quick and they get you through the line fast. There is a dine in area as well. Sign up for the caniac club to get points and deals."}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders. Love this one, very fast and friendly service. Don't forget to get hot sauce when you come here!"}
{"text":"This place confuses me to review.  What do I comment on?  They've got Chicken Tenders, Fries, Texas Toast, and that's about it?  Here's what I did like about the place.  Staff - Very friendly, outgoing, not your stereotypical fast food types. Decor - They did a nice job of capturing the local community within the store. Cleanliness - Overall good and they were actively working to keep it that way.  Nice to see.  I can't give it more than 3 stars though because the food to me was just average.  I much prefer Chick Fil A for their chicken and their fries are definitely much better.  Service there is always an A+.  So overall, good not great.  Would I go back, yes if there wasn't a CFA nearby.  Otherwise, no."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. The family loves this place. Any of tgere box combos are the way to go...Chicken, sweet tea is so so good!"}
{"text":"so... i thought that they were suppose to be selling chicken strips... not chicken nuggets. :/ it was great when it first opened up in las vegas, but it seems that the quality has severely gone down. should have seen my face when i first came back to vegas expecting the great chicken strips that i had left behind. i wouldn't recommend it as i would have before."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how anyone can complain about Raising Canes. I'm from the south where Zaxbys and Chick-fil-a are infamous for their amazing food and to me Raising Canes even beat out Zaxbys. The food is amazing. To the guy below complaining about not being served at the drive through on foot. It's legit a safety issue? They don't serve anyone on foot anywhere at a drive through. Literally the dumbest review I've ever read. I imagine the bad reviews are the same people who rave about how great (barf) in and out is. You like stale dry food and strawberries that aren't ripe. We know your tastebuds suck out west"}
{"text":"These guys need to think outside the caniac combo box. I  went there late night in my 25ft RV after the dining room had closed, but the drive-thru was open. Since my RV is to big to get through the drive-thru, I attempted to order over the phone and planned on walking to the window to pick up and pay. I was literally parked right outside the window, but they refused to serve me. I love their food, but would have loved a meal that night even more. Next time I guess I'll have to use Uber Eats to get my food delivered 10 ft."}
{"text":"If chicken fingers is your thing, then you've found your place.  My kids have been bugging me forever to come into a Cane's, and I've always delayed because I am truly not a chicken finger type. I finally gave in last night. I ordered through drive thru, and the building looks really new.  Frankly, I rate 4.5 overall, but I can't get the half star to highlight.   Pros - chunks of tender  chicken pieces with a nice crisp. Service was great! The chicken sauce dip thing is yummy.  Cons - can't think of any.  What I like most - their ketchup packets! So cute and triple the size of the squeeze type.  I'm keeping them.  Lol!"}
{"text":"I love this location!  The drive-thru line is usually around the building, guess that means the food is good!!!  I signed up for the Caniac Club, received my free box yet not really sure about the program, doesn't seem like you any good reason to present the card.  Maybe the marketing team should put some thought into that, reward your loyal customers.  Clean, fast and great food."}
{"text":"After waiting 5 minutes to find parking, then waiting another 10 minutes in line, I was refused my order because I only had $100.00 in cash.  It was one of the new snazzy bills, all crisp and ready for circulation, but that is not good enough for Cane's.  Due to a rash of counterfeit $100.00 being funneled thru this location (I DOUBT IT) my money was automatically suspect.  The only thing suspect is this policy.  The manager would rather lose a customer over this nonsense.  Counterfeits exist, but get over yourself Cane's."}
{"text":"I came here not only because I saw it on Yelp but because some of my friends told me to. So I brought my neice and nephew since they wanted some chicken fingers. We all got the 3 piece meal which included, duh, 3 pieces of chicken fingers, piece of bread, fries and a drink. The bread just reminded me a little like Hawaiian bread, slightly toasted. Fries were just ok. Sweet tea was good and I could feel the cavity creeps starting to make a home as I drank it. Chicken fingers were crispy and seasoned nicely but the secret sauce was THE BOMB YO! Yeah, I said \"the bomb yo\". You taste it and wonder \"what the hell is in this?\" I was trying to figure out what the flavors were in this sauce. It could have been ass juice and barf for all I know. Actually, it seemed to have a thousand island background. Ranch too? I dont know. But it was hella good. Yeah, I said hella."}
{"text":"OMG we went to Raising Cane's because we were given a gift card. It was amazing. My husband does not like chicken strips but you all have won him over. The chicken was moist yet crunchy, the secret sauce was amazing too.  The staff at the Cactus location were very nice. The resturant was very clean and the food came really fast.  Oh yea and the toast was amazing too.  We will visit again soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place it's always jumping this weekend even so there were no empty tables and we decided to just do to go. It only took 10 to 15 minutes for my food and it was fresh and hot I love this place there sauce is really the boss I love it . This is a great spot for the locals and your family from out of town.Price is good for the quality of the food"}
{"text":"It's alright.  It's fried chicken with frozen fries.  I'd say the best part is the Texas toast.  Help was \"meh,\" but their \"special sauce\" was pretty tasty.  I wouldn't stop here if there was a chick-fil-a close by."}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure,  The four piece meal (the \"box\") is a ton of food, I do recommend ordering an extra cane's sauce as it only comes with one.  The employees are friendly, only reason it's four stars instead of five is because the drive-thru line can take a really long time."}
{"text":"Everyone loves the food and I do too. However, learning about shady, unhonest management and then to top it off, I get ZERO response when I called to ask about cost for a Catering order. I'm done. This location will never get my business."}
{"text":"The sweet tea and lemonade here is amazing. Don't forget to get extra dipping sauce either!"}
{"text":"I have ate here several times and I have never had a problem till now. Two nights ago, I was in the area and decided why not stop by. BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER! I had FOOD POISONING all day yesterday! I was vomiting to the point where I had to take off work yesterday and today. I am never going back to this place again."}
{"text":"The staff here is the friendliest I've seen at any fast food place I've been to. That applies to both in house & in the drive thru. In fact the manager stops by during your meal to see if everything is ok or if you need anything else. If a booth is dirty the staff will not let you sit down until it is cleaned fully.   The food is great & the menu is simple. Most UNLV games offer a free meal w/ a ticket here so if you're unsure about the food, try it for free. I'm sure after one taste you'll be hooked!   If you're wanting a break from hamburgers & other fast food chains, check out Raising Cane's for something new & tasty!"}
{"text":"The line for drive thru was wrapped around the building so we went inside to place a to go order.  They gave us our food really fast!  I was truly surprised considering how busy they were.  The food is excellent and priced fair.  The place was new and clean and the employees were nice.  Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"chicken and sauce was bomb.com  texas toast was scrumptous tooo  but the lady in the drive was not a happy camper! one day she was rude next day she was nice.  maybe she bipolar  anyway ill still go here regardless of the crappy service"}
{"text":"I was told to try this place out by someone who makes an obligatory trip every time they are in Las Vegas... and it was absolutely amazing!  I ordered the Caniac Combo (be prepared for a lot of food), and it was delicious! Bread was nice and buttery, coleslaw did it's job, crinkle-cut fries were yummy and chicken was breaded to perfection.   Their iced tea was very solid as well - I'm not much of a fan on the sweet side so I mixed the unsweetened and the sweetened tea together for a great mix.   I'm having cravings for Raising Cane's as I write this review... take me back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves the sweet tea here! Oh AND the Canes sauce is amazeballs!!! Fair WARNING: it's always busy."}
{"text":"I love me some Raising Cane's!  I've been waiting for them to open up in SoCal, and they finally have.  Despite the countless dining options in Las Vegas, this was always on the 'go-to' list.  I think of Raising Cane's as the chicken finger version of In-n-Out Burger.  They have a simple menu, clean restaurants and friendly staff.  I have never had a bad experience at any Raising Cane's and all of the employees seem genuinely happy to work there.  The fact that they have an adorable dog as their mascot (Cane) doesn't hurt either.  The chicken fingers are good, especially with their signature sauce.  Cole slaw and fries are also winners as is their Texas toast (LOVE their Texas toast!).  There really is something to be said about no over-diversifying your menu.  Keep it simple and so it right.  Cane's also involves themselves with local charities, and currently have a promotion during the holidays where you can buy a little stuffed Cane in a \"Buddy the Elf\" costume and proceeds will go to charity.  If you've never been here, you must go.  It's as simple as that."}
{"text":"THE BEST CHICKEN EVER!!!! The only chicken I would eat. All other places have terrible chicken but raising canes is and will always be the best. Idc what anyone says. Popeyes, KFC, and churches is nasty compared to canes!"}
{"text":"The chicken is pretty flame. I would've given it 5 stars but the guy I'm assuming is the store manager is incredibly passive aggressive. Check this, after 11pm you best make sure you're out of his restaurant because he starts slamming chairs into tables just to make sure everyone hears him cleaning up. We'll still be coming back because they're one of like three restaurants open late, but still pretty rude"}
{"text":"Hot and tasty!  Great service and nice atmosphere for a fast food place. Really folks; why would you stop here if you are focusing on health food?"}
{"text":"This place can rival Chick-Fil-A...that is how GOOD the chicken is!  The quality of the food is fresh and the sweet tea is the BOMB!  And not only is the food is good, when you use your credit card, they ask for i.d. so you know they make sure there's no FRAUD."}
{"text":"I'm out here visiting my parents, some friends from home have said we need to try Raising Canes. So much so that it was to the point of annoying. Just to appease them when I get home, my mom, sister and I decided to stop and try them out. When we got to the front of the line we told the gal that it was our first time. She went thru our options, recommending the box because it came with a little bit of everything. Behind her, the manager turned around and asked where we were from. Told him San Diego, and he started telling us all about the expansion plans they have. And he's right, there are a couple opening near us very soon. He then turned to the window, said something to the person in the kitchen, and turned around with a strip and sauce for us to try while we decided. We were all shocked! When was the last time anyone gave you something for free at a chain restaurant? We ordered and sat down. The manager came by after we had received our food to check in. It was a great experience. The food was yummy and the staff was super friendly! Will definitely be going back again. And our friends at home.... the win this round."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Raising Canes.  It was delicious!  The chicken fingers were made fresh when I ordered them.  The fries were hit and seasoned well.  The lemonade I got with my meal tasted like fresh squeezed!   For a fast food place I give Canes a 5 star!  Clean, Fresh, Tasty, and great customer service.  The Texas toast was probably not needed as there was a lot if food on the plate. Well done!!  I did have to park in the back of the parking lot as there weren't any spaces left.  While eating I noticed a TMobile employee get into her car and drive off.  She was parked in the front spot of Canes."}
{"text":"Good chicken strips & I love the sweet tea!! They support local charities & school/college teams too!!"}
{"text":"Raising canes. I give this place 3 stars, it's nothing special, but does its job. There are days when I'm really hungry for lunch, and a sandwich or burger just doesn't sound good, so usually I hit up canes for a quick lunch. The menu is basic, pretty much chicken tender combos or chicken strip sandwich. The combos come with Texas toast, fries, or coleslaw.  Usually I end up getting the box combo which is 4 strips and some sides. Overall it's pretty good and hits the spot. The only draw back is sometimes you get small chicken tenders that are barely  bigger than a chicken nugget. Most of the time it's pretty consistent.  For a decent lunch give this place a try, not worth my dinner appetite though. Lol. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Raising Caine's is a great place for families. It is a staple for the local teens, I know first hand.I used to do Caine's runs for my daughter when she went to High school. It was convenient due to the drive thru and it was open early enough to get her a meal when her scheduled lunch was at 11:00 . I used to bring her lunch on Fridays and this was part of the rotation.  The chicken strips are generous and tender, not a dry one in the lot. Normally chicken breasts can dry but not at this place. Above average fast food in my book. My daughter love their coleslaw and would replace it for the fries at no additional cost. The Texas toast is buttery, the fries are crisp and the service good.   For fast food, this is a family favorite!"}
{"text":"The chicken fingers were wonderful!  The sauce is excellent too.  Very friendly help staff.  Clean.  Yes, I'd come again."}
{"text":"Didn't give some chicken in our Caniac, decided to give us a second meal on the house.  Best customer service 10/10"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. But what a shame that the closes one to me has poor management. I order a 3 piece combo with 3 extra sauces excluding the one already given. When I arrived all the way back home I found only 1 out of 4 sauces. I don't really care about the sauces, but this was the last straw. Every time I go to this place they always forget something. Especially at night forgetting things such as; giving Toast instead of that bland coleslaw and requesting no ice and still given a full cup of it. They only care to get things in and out, not how you like your order."}
{"text":"One of the nicest Raising Cane's in the valley. Good quality food for an average price. My favorite item from Raising Cane's is the sweet tea. The sweet tea is very good, definitely the best in town. The staff at this restaurant are nice, and they do a good job at keeping the restaurant clean."}
{"text":"I had a three finger basket today, but I substituted the Texas toast for more fries at no extra cost. I like that I can do that. I didn't know that was an option until recently. You can substitute the sauce, the toast, and the coke slaw for other items.  The service today was quick. A guy who I thought was the manager was helping pick up baskets and clear tables to help keep everything moving. The only downside today was that I thought the chicken fingers looked smaller than usual.  I like that this restaurant generally provides a quick and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Good, Yummy,  delicious , chicken !  The sauce !!!!  I switch  the coleslaw for another bread and the lemonade is so cold and love the tiny ice ! Love this place !"}
{"text":"the line was ridiculous the good was okay. I've had a better raising canes in Mississippi even the ones in Vegas are better but maybe it's because they are new maybe ill try them again in a few months. but on this visit I wasn't impressed and it wasn't what I know it can be!"}
{"text":"Have to judge this place knowing that you're going to a fast food restaurant which means you cannot hold it to the high standards that you would a steakhouse for a world renowned chef's restaurant. I mean come on people you're going here specifically to get chicken tenders, so they must be judged according to their service of you and getting you chicken tenders. I came to the drive-through what about four people in my car and we all have separate orders. We made that clear to the person on the other end of the drive through water thing and they said that would be fine. They took each person's orders and asked us if they had our order correctly. They also asked us if we wanted any additional sauces for our meals. They made the payment process easy when we approach the payment and pick up window and we were very pleased and able to leave quickly. That's what fast food should be like. You're getting your food fast and that's exactly what we did. Good job raising canes!"}
{"text":"I don't really understand what the big fat is about this place. The chicken is fresh and seems to be made from scratch however it is in season so it doesn't have a great taste to it. It's simply fresh. The best part of being here is the dipping sauce. Raising cane's dipping sauce is the best thing they have going for them. The service is what you would expect from a fast food restaurant so I cannot complain about that. I do like the drinks are free refills which is always good. This seems to be a hit place for people to visit when they're in town in Vegas but I wouldn't go back if I had a choice. It is not as much as a must try places people make it out to be. Save your money and hit up a genuine \"must try\" in Vegas but raising Cane's is not it  #EatHereOrNot"}
{"text":"I've gone to this location all but one time, it is great.  The chicken is always so moist and the Cane's sauce is delicious.  After trying one of the other locations I decided to try and come to this one whenever possible, it was the first time I thought their chicken was dry.  The workers have always been polite and the wait has always been reasonable, although we've never gone through the drive-thru."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!!! Jim W, my incredible husband, eats there whenever he's in LV. He's told me about it and after a while, I started to think I needed to try it. So that was our first stop when we got to town.  Abby and I split a Caniac combo. It came w/one drink, six strips, fries and two pieces of texas toast. The fries were fine, the toast was really good, and the chicken strips were AMAZING! Who needs the rest. It's like going out for hot wings - all you need are the strips. And they serve them w/this weird sauce that no one can explain. Jimmy couldn't tell me what it was, but much more telling, the women at the counter - including the manager - could tell me either. But it was quite good. Abby and I both liked it. I can't tell you what it is.  But what I can say is GO TO RAISING CANE'S! You won't regret it. I promise. And it's not like patronizing a chain because it's local - it only has a couple of locations. Oops! I just found it it is a chain. Sorry. But it's an exception. Like Texas Roadhouse and Carrabba's. So go. Now. I don't care what time it is.  Are you still waiting?  Am I just wasting my breath here?  Seriously, I don't need to hear myself talk ...  I mean they're open until midnight - what time are you reading this anyway?"}
{"text":"Completely understand why people talked about this place the chicken fingers are better than most of the other places in town the dipping sauce is also very yummy"}
{"text":"Okay this is my second time here I haven't figured out what makes this place so popular the chicken tenders are okay not any better than KFC or churches I think Popeyes is better the chicken itself just has a plain breading fried and all they have is their stupid cane sauce which is ok but this place is always packed and they're not really that cheap so I can't figure it out may go back in the future"}
{"text":"Been there 50 times and paid with debit card, today for whatever reason the young lady asked me for ID. I've never been to a drive thru where when you pay with a card they ask for ID"}
{"text":"I'm from Cali and I'm super far from the Costa Mesa location so any chance I visit LV, I grab some Canes! I usually order the 3 piece combo which gets me feeling full. There's just something about that special sauce which makes everything that much better. It goes great with the fries, chicken, and bread! I'm really jealous of Vegas residents for having this restaurant lol, but maybe it's a good thing we don't have it in Cali...I would eat this once a week!  One thing I don't like is that you have to pay 31 cents for extra sauce...lol oh well, I'd still pay for more!"}
{"text":"Was  in Vegas for  my  Dad's 80th birthday - I missed breakfast and this  was down the street from where  I was staying ( Cancun Resort).  Chicken looked   good   but  I was disappointed, it really was to me.  What did it taste  like 0 it tasted  like banquet frozen chicken strips.   The texas toast tasted bland to  and also seemed  frozen. Fries were limp on the soggy side.  I didn't get  the coleslaw they gave  me an exrta sauce which I barely  used.  It get's two  stars for the service which was above average.  I might  try another Raising Cain's,  but  not this one.  I ordered  my   food to  go, if  it was dine-in I probably would  have said   something."}
{"text":"Meh. It was decent. The chicken was good. I didn't understand the Texas toast? It wasn't great. The crinkle cut fries looked like the kind you buy frozen at the grocery store. Luckily they tasted pretty good. Someone begged us to go here saying it was better than Chik-fil-A. Uh, no. Not at all. But it was still pretty good. Oh, the sauce was amazingly good! Props for that. And my husband's cole slaw was good. Not sure I would make the drive again though."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!  Needed to feed a baseball team.  Antoinet was amazing, happy, and very helpful.  Thanks so much for walking me through it.  The hungry kids thank you too!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! So much that I want to own one here in Cali! Every time we go to Vegas we have Raising Canes!!!! The chicken fingers are so perfect and even the Texas toast hits the spot.  The employees are always pleasant and it is probably b/c they get to eat texas toast and drink sweet tea all day long.   You should totally check this place out whenever you can!"}
{"text":"The place was a little busy, a little dirty, a little crazy.  Guess that means people love the place 'cause it was slammed.  Would you like chicken strips, or chicken strips with a side, or chicken strips with 2 sides and a lemonade.  That's it... chicken strips. But really good chicken strips."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I really wanted to like this place because our teenagers love it.  It was lunch time and it was handy.  It was sooo busy and I just knew it would be great.  It was barely so-so.  Yes, really. Not so much.  KFC has much better flavor.  Hard to believe. The sauce is not that great and like others have mentioned the fries were worse than frozen from my oven.  Don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"We have visited this location multiple times and have found both times to have slow service but good food."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The sauce is amazing and the tailgate finger special is a great bargain.  LOVE IT!!!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken was great, fries were OK, but no ranch? Really?"}
{"text":"Coming from Canada this place has the best chicken. So tender and the portions are so big. I loved their sweet tea. A good stop after shopping at the outlet mall."}
{"text":"Oh Raising Cane's. How I have missed you so.  I'm currently living in Northern California, but used to go to Raising Cane's quite often when I used to live in Vegas. I miss their delicious dipping sauce that comes with the chicken fingers. I miss their Texas Toast. And I definitely miss their sweet tea. I always had to mix their sweet tea with regular tea because it was a tad bit too sweet for my taste buds. But I still miss it!  It's been a while since I've had it last. But I enjoyed it so much that I just had to express my love for it through this review."}
{"text":"I give this place a 4 1/2.  The chicken here is SO so so good. Honestly...if you don't like it I think you're completely insane. Some of the best chicken I've had in my life. And that sauce. Omg their sauce is delicious. I always need more than one because I can't stop eating it. The bread is super delicious too.  It's also a great price. Absolutely love this place.  The only thing that confuses me is that I have heard so many good things about the tea. I think the tea is so nasty. Everyone seems to like it. Not sure why it taste so bad to me."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place got such good reviews. This was my first (and last) time here. The chicken is barely average, so are the fries. Their sauce is tasteless and they offer no alternative, not even the standard ranch. The coleslaw was \"tired\" and too sweet, no crunchiness, probably had been waiting in the hot kitchen for a while. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!  THE MANAGER BRIAN SPIT IN MY HUSBANDS FOOD AND THREATENED TO CALL THE COPS ON HIM!  I had a problem with my order at this Cane's previously.  We went back and the fixed it, no problem a month or so ago.  Today my husband went in and ordered some food to go.  The manager personally delivered it to his table and asked that he check my food right away.  Not thinking twice, he advised him that it wasn't needed and he was sure the food was fine.  He kept insisting, and he was asked to leave the table.  Suspicious, my husband checked the order and found spit on his fries.  When he brings this to the attention of the staff, the manager REFUSED to refund his money and threatened to call the cops on him.  WHAT KIND OF SERVICE IS THIS?  My husband is disabled, and I am appalled that he would be treated like this.  I WILL NEVER EAT AT THIS RAISING CANES AGAIN."}
{"text":"What can i say, we tried this location and its just as good as the others. This one is new so everything is fresh and spotless. This is the first one we went inside since it was 105° we opted to eat in, we usually do drive thru. The place was packed but only like 2 ppl in line. Order taken got drinks found seats and about 3 minutes later food was delivered to us. I will say it again the best chicken strips ive EVER had."}
{"text":"We go to Vegas about 8 times a year(we love Nevada) but we never stop at any of the many many Raising Canes that we would pass. A friend of mine was raving about this place b4 our last trip so we had to make a point of trying it. On May 3rd on our way to the freeway to head back to L.A we stopped and BOY WE'RE WE GLAD WE DID. These were the best chicken fingers we have EVER had, so juicy and the fingers weren't just all crispy batter.The batter is thin so u just get this deliciously juicy tender. This place is so simple, they do 1 thing chicken fingers, just 2 sides, 2 sauces & Texas toast, huge chix strip sand comes with 3 strips. But it proves if u do 1 thing do it better than anyone else. And they will come, and we did & will continue. Oh the service was wonderful,we went through the drivethru, our receipt says Shelby, he was awesome. I understand we have our first one just opened here in Cali not to far from us, will have to try it out."}
{"text":"This review is for the drive through. When we arrived the line was long - but it went really fast.  Maybe 5 min total. Order was correct, food was fresh & service friendly. They did a great job getting us through the long line fast & food consistently good!"}
{"text":"Cooked and salted fries, hard to find this even at Canes. Danielle greated me and took my order. She was very personable.  She also took time to clean the tables and chairs when no one was in line after she brought me my food.  Bathroom was clean with funny Christmas elf stickers on the mirror."}
{"text":"LOVE RAISING CANES!!! So delicious and your order is made fresh so it takes just a tiny bit but definitely worth the wait. You can also sub out the coleslaw for another piece of toast or more sauce! Also join their \"Caniac Club\" for free food!"}
{"text":"Well I was on my way to work after a doctor's appointment and decided to get me something to eat and Raising Cane's was right there in my face so I stopped. I ended up getting the 6 piece chicken tenders with a lemonade.   Got my order and food was warm however the french fries did seem to be old but not as bad as they should. The chicken tenders looked yummy, fresh, and golden brown but......There wasn't much seasoning on them at all.  It's not like I needed the salt anyway but I wanted a little flavor.  The lemondade was to die for!!!!  It was a hit so I was definitely satisfied and will come back anyway if I am in the area and close. One thing I need to get out of the habit of is comparing them to Zaxbys and it's only because I miss that place so much.  So it's hard to review sometimes when you are automatically comparing it to another food chain and you are just missing out on it."}
{"text":"The chicken is very moist, however the flavor is just so-so. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Fast and speedy service and always very friendly. Only reason it's not a 5 star is because they don't give you enough Canes sauce. Other that it's my go to fingers spot :)"}
{"text":"Well who doesn't like Raising Canes?   I love this location in particular. Very clean and staff is always friendly.  I usually get the three finger combo. 3 chicken strips, fries, toast, and a drink. I have to be honest...their chicken strips are not my favorite. But I do love the fries and toast. Oh! And the lemonade. It is absolutely delicious. So delicious in fact, that you are charged some extra cents for refills. But totally worth it! One of these days I am going to buy a gallon of that stuff. There is also a huge hype over their \"special sauce.\" I think it's good, but nothing too special."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Cane's?!  I actually don't think I've ever stepped foot in this location.  I always go through the drive-thru.  The staff here is usually very friendly.  I always get the three finger combo.  It comes with three chicken fingers, cole slaw, toast, fries, and sauce.  I love that you can sub out items that you don't want at Cane's.  I trade out my cole slaw for an extra piece of toast. :-)  Their sweet tea and lemonade are to die for!! DELICIOUS.  The only thing that sucks about the lemonade is that they charge you extra for it, and extra for refills.  Their tea and lemonade are so good that they sell them by the gallon.  The lemonade recipe however doesn't seem to be consistent.  Sometimes it is watery, and that's super disappointing.  That's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Best chicken strips in town. Fresh tasting and great sauce. Their Texas toast is delicious also. Top it all off with sweet tea or a muddy water (their version of an Arnold Palmer) all for $7"}
{"text":"Love Raising Cane's. I ordered the Box and ate it all. Super delicious chicken and Texas toast. The fries are ehhh but everything else, including the people that work here, is good. My only complaint is the small parking lot. It gets pretty busy here sometimes and it's hard to find a spot."}
{"text":"4 stars for the great food and customer service. I work in the food industry as well and 21 minutes is a very  long wait. Even for a busy place."}
{"text":"Where's the ranch?! Came here before work for a quick bite. I ordered the chicken sandwich and three extra fingers on the side plus a medium drink. The total was 10.01, I gave the cashier a 10.00 dollar bill that I had on my hand ready thinking that it would be enough. She stood there waiting for me to come up with the missing penny, I gave her another 10.00 dollar bill and she gave me my 9.99 change back, I took the four pennies and placed them on the side so the next person that needed a penny could use them.  When I got my chicken I realized there was no dipping sauce so I went back to the counter and asked an employee for some ranch for my chicken, the guy looked at me like I had asked for something no one has ever asked for and said \" we don't have that.\"  can I get some BBQ then? \" we don't have that either. \"  you mean. You're out of everything? \" No. we only carry our special sauce \" ( ok, now that you made me feel stupid for asking for something weird like ranch dressing in a chicken finger place ), can I have some of your special sauce, please? \" sure, that'll be 31 cents\"  by now I'm wishing I would've stopped at a 7/11 and got a freaking hot dog, but luckily I had change thanks to employee number one. I handed him 35 Cents that he then handed to employee # 1 (cashier), she was busy taking someone else order so she sat the money on the side and took the four cents that I had previously left and gave them to me as change. WTF!  And now that my rant is out of the way, here's my review........  The Chicken is good and BYOD.      ( bring your own dressing)"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's has some of the best chicken out there! One of my favorite chain restaurants around. Staff was friendly, although service was a little slow when I was there. Chicken strips are must!  Just moved to Vegas, and I'm glad to have found this place so close to home. Will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Yum so good! The service is friendly and the food is so good! My favorite is the chicken sandwich. Definitely try the Canes sauce. Prices are very fair. Have tried more locations and gotten the same warm, friendly experience. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I was about to eat and one of the employees walks behind the register and asks me if ive been helped, i said yes, and then tells me \"im the manager amd theres no,guns allowed, can you leave lock your gun in your car\" i said ok, and went and locked it in my car.  As im walking in i see no type of sign or pictures with \"no guns allowed\" i went then asked another employee,   apologize. Had my handgun on me, if. Would have seen a sign i wouldn't have brought it in. He says \"theres a sign, just cant see it\" i tell him oh, ok.  Didnt see it can you show me?  So he says confidently \"yeah ill show,you! \" and continues to walk towards the doors and starts looking for a supposed \" sign\" of the no guns allowed. And when he couldnt find it he bolted inside.  My sggestion if you Open carry, as i do. DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Raising canes is my go to for a quick bite and I love how they open early since I'm an early bird. But la'trell provided my sister and I with outstanding costumer service which was very appreciated. Defiantly going back to this location."}
{"text":"Ended up doing overtime and had a late meeting so I decided to stop here for something to eat on my way home.  I had not eaten anything since breakfast so I thought I was starving and ordered the Caniac combo and got extra fries instead of coleslaw.  Boy was I wrong I barely could eat half of it because I guess I wasn't as hungry as I thought.  But none the less I had leftovers for the next day.   There was a bit of a line and I could tell this particular canes probably gets really crowded because they had cones set up directing you to the drive thru.  There were a few cars ahead of me but the line went fairly quickly so the wait wasn't too bad.  The service was pretty damn awesome, friendly, and very attentive.   Now down to the food.  OMG the food was absolutely perfect!  My chicken was fresh hot, my fries were fresh and hot, and my bread was cooked so perfectly.  I am not much of a bread person but the toast was out of this world.  The chicken strips were HUGE and meaty and you can tell it was all white meat.  Since I am a french fry head the fries were good but I just wish they had the thicker crinkle cut fries instead of the thin crinkle cut fries.  But they were still good.   I do recommend this place as they have excellent service, delicious food, and very well organized.  Now need to fill my survey out to see if I can win Cane's for a year.  :-)"}
{"text":"I used to live in Georgia and Zaxbys was my favorite place. This place reminded me of them so I decided to try. The menu is very similar.  I couldn't wait to eat the Texas toast so I had to eat it before I got home.  It was warm and delicious. The chicken fingers are meaty and juicy. Their sauce is good too. The crinkle fries are awesome they just don't give you enough.  I have found the place to help with mg Zaxbys fix."}
{"text":"Oh so finger licking good. The chicken strips are fried to perfection. I like the old fashioned crinkly fries as well. Cole slaw not bad, don't really get the piece of Texas Toast, but I say who cares, my tummy is satisfied.   I've been trying to figure out what is in the secret sauce though: ketchup, mayonnaise, creole spice, black pepper to taste...??  Anyone know out there?   Great Southern 'fast food' and friendly service."}
{"text":"Stopped by on 12/26, mall was packed all the restaurants were full.  I thought that Cane's could get us quick service through the drive through.  Yep!  They rocked out the 25 piece tailgate tray and my family of six inhaled those strips as fast as we got them.  I think we soaked up every last bit of the sauces as well.  Thank you Cane's from preventing a car load of Hangry kids and especially Dad, Happy New Year!"}
{"text":"This is a real typical fast-food chain place.  Strips are ok, drink is ok, fries are pretty bad and the toast is ok.  Not so sure why there are so many good reviews for this chain.  Maybe compared to other fast-food places?  I don't know.  But compared to a real southern-style restaurant that serves fried chicken?  Not even close.  Just completely pass on this.  Especially in Vegas as there are a ton of great places to eat in this town.  I only went  'cause it was late at night and I didn't feel like dealing with the \"hip\" crowd that night."}
{"text":"I love this place. It reminds me of Zaxby's from the South. Simple good food, dipped in tasty sauce.   I always like getting the Big Box meal so I can have the coleslaw, but I find the coleslaw tastes too salty for my liking. It's the one thing that makes me a little sad, but it won't stop me from enjoying everything else.  Service today was great, every single employee seemed to have great customer service skills, which was refreshing for a fast food joint."}
{"text":"We need this in Utah! The toast is just s nice touch. It's always warm food. I needed just one more sauce packet; 2 isn't enough."}
{"text":"spoke with heather the manager on duty cause i ordered food last night at like 120 in the morning food was cold and hard she seemed bot to care thanks heather"}
{"text":"Fast friendly and courtesy and helpful services and clean and the food is good and no waiting."}
{"text":"I was finishing a move and I wanted to treat a helpful friend out to dinner. This is the restaurant that was recommended. I pass by this location so many times I've never really tried the food here. I ordered the Caniac Combo for us to share. It includes 6 chicken fingers, a tangy sauce, crinkle cut fries, Texas toast, coleslaw, and a large drink for my friend. The highlight of this order are the chicken fingers, they are so crispy and tender. I especially like the fluffy, buttery texture of Texas toast and would like another one please. And the batch of well-done crinkle cut fries are my kryptonite. If I'm ever craving for good quality Fast Food, I would go here."}
{"text":"It's too bad there's none of these close to where I live. At the same time it's probably for the best. The chicken is really good. The texas toast, and dip for the chicken are what set this place apart from usual chicken joints. MMM."}
{"text":"This raising canes is good but it's not up to the quality of other canes. Maybe they haven't been open long enough but there are a few things the need to get in order to earn 5 stars."}
{"text":"If there's a Caucasian man working the window check your bag & change . Meal was 6.48 gave him 20.03 & got back 13.51 u do the math also ask for hot sauce didn't receive any . When I brought up the missing change this customer was wrong until I helped him with his math"}
{"text":"OMG where did this place come from moved from desert ridge area and lived in scottsdale in the past and never knew of this place. Basic like In and Out's menu only a few options but delish chicken. way way way better the KFC (never have been a huge fan of KFC) so I love this place. Have to try it at least once. If your a sauce fan then you will like the dippng sauce. drive through is quick and the dine in is kept clean and for a fast food for them to bring you your food I thought was really cool. HUGE fan will keep going back !!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Raising Canes is pretty good! Service was quick and friendly. Their Canes sauce is great & the portions were huge. Chicken and coleslaw were good very good! Solid fast food spot."}
{"text":"Convenient location to stop by after work from St Rose Siena. Quite busy but expected from all the Cane's locations  Came here once at night after shift around 9ish o clock. Lots of cars in drive through. Came here for lunch, less cars in drive thru. Pretty quick service.   Food is as per usual for canes. Too bad the time for lunch, we had it sit in the office for an hour or two before we had the chance to eat it (busy busy).   Took leftovers home and reheated it up in a small oven. Comes out nice and crispy, and hot too. Trick is just to so it at a low-ish temp. Dont rush or it will burn ! :P"}
{"text":"I wonder if Cane's raises there own chickens in the back because without a doubt there chicken is fresh! The sauce is the perfect combination of salty and spicy. The bread is always moist and soft. Canes's blows KFC out the water."}
{"text":"Mike A.G.M Very outstanding person very professional and helpful he made sure my order was right. Please keeping hiring people like him very cool guy. Mahalo n God bless.."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how or why this place is such a hit ... even with me!  The chicken tenders are good - with sauce.  I can't eat them without some sort of sauce or ketchup because they just don't taste like much.  It's like they don't season the batter at all.  There's more seasoning (just salt) on the fries than on the chicken tenders.  I don't visit Raising Cane's often because I think the food is so bland.  Occasionally though, the kid in me fiends for chicken tenders.  When I have that craving I normally satisfy it with Raising Cane's.  That is until I tried Church's Chicken the other night.  Now I'm hooked! Going forward I'm taking my chicken tender cravings there."}
{"text":"Love it here and come all the time with my friends. Great for groups and super friendly staff. The food is always hot and fresh and wonderful. They have a board of photos that they take with some of their customers and have high school stuff and posters all around that are cool or funny. Great place to go for lunch or whatever!"}
{"text":"Great chicken fingers the sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp when I hit \"breakfast\". Well it is a chicken fingers joint and they open at 9am so I guess it's considered breakfast.  But thank you Yelp for this as I have been to vegas numerous times, but never knew about this place. Who doesn't love chicken fingers, but many places will sell the already made and processed ones, but this place is legit.  The fries are great, coleslaw is delicious,  and the chicken fingers just melt in your mouth.  Try it for lunch or as a snack....I got the \"the box\". They also have their own sauce and its a combination of thousand island and something delicious."}
{"text":"The draw here is that everything is nice and fresh! You can taste it when your eating that the oil they use if fresh. They ONLY serve chicken fingers and they do a great job on them. I am always pleased that I get exactly what I expect out of the place. They also have some sweet tea that is worth a try if you like that kinda thing. They cater for parties in larger portions all the way up to 100 finger tailgates I believe. You pay roughly $1 a chicken finger and the Texas toast is a epic good side to choose. Other Options are coleslaw and french fries. Overall the place is clean offers good service is open till 11pm and has exactly what they advertise! GREAT CHICKEN FINGERS!"}
{"text":"I have waited to review Cane's until I had it a few times to be sure it could really be this good. IT IS!!! The Chicken Fingers are fresh tasting and cooked perfectly. The sides are outstanding. The Cane's sauce is wonderful! They give you plenty of food for the money. Nice dine in area. Great service. They do one thing (chicken) and do it really well. Just outstanding!"}
{"text":"Got to Vegas with the wife and kids.  We weren't starving but needed something for dinner.  Did not want to get dressed up for a sit down dinner as we were tired.  Checked YELP and found the rave reviews on this place.  Close to our hotel.  We went to try it out and were not disappointed.  The reviews were dead on.  Staff was friendly, place was clean and the food was great.  Chicken was truly moist and juicy, fries were crisp, Texas toast was moist and tasty and the sauce was a great addition.  My wife tried the sweet tea she said those reviews were accurate as well.  It is not glamorous or fancy but for good fresh food at a good price, this place is a must visit."}
{"text":"food was surprisingly good - wouldn't say better or worse than chick fil a but different.  wished they opened these in SF Bay Area."}
{"text":"Went in a few days ago for lunch. Had no expectations. Food is tasteless. You taste that something was fried and there is salt. Special sauce is nothing special. Fries are boring. Friendly place and they make a big effort to keep it clean. No reason to return but then again like most fast food no reason to not return if you are eating fast food"}
{"text":"This particular location seems larger than the ones I'm used to. :) You can never go wrong with Cane's especially for the great combos, sweet tea & their decent prices."}
{"text":"I love going to canes, I've never been to this location but I was very disappointed. I had two different people taking my order at the same time- which made it really confusing. When I got home and opened my food I noticed the chicken tenders were very small. I'm not used to this and kinda upset this is the closest location to my house."}
{"text":"The food itself is actually good.  They just tossed my food into a paper bag. Slid my food across the counter at me. The bag landed on the floor.  They all just laughed at me. And said. Oh My Bad.  And he. Oh so Sorry. As he snickered at me.  Spilled my drink.  Don't waist you're time here.  Very mean. And rude."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start, every time I go to Canes, the food is always good. I love their chicken, fries, butter Texas toast, sauce and coleslaw. Never once had I gotten something from there and it taste bad. They have one of the best customer service around...ALWAYS GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! I enjoy their 20% off for first responder, military, and  CCSD employees. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who wants good fried chicken strips."}
{"text":"The food was good and the only reason I'm even making a review is because of the great customer service. I sat down and they actually asked me how I was doing and if my food was taking long to come out, and the same crew member even checked up on it after that. On top of that I tried getting some ketchup and a worker offered to get it for me. All in all pretty impressed by their customer service considered it's fast food and you're usually on your own once your food comes out."}
{"text":"It may sound weird to have a Rewards Card to a fast food joint but this place is the best. Special Sauce, Texas Toast, and America's favorite fried chicken! Why not have a rewards card when you know you'll come back when you're feeling hungry and lazy!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I tried it for the first time and I immediately told my boyfriend this is my new fave spot! The service has always been fast and friendly the times we have been in the drive thru.  Canes sauce is something special, canes chicken is sooooo good either way. Overall I'm happy with this location and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"They only make one thing Chicken fingers and they are awesome at it.  If you want some good fried chicken fingers then give it a try Love it great flavor"}
{"text":"I just simply love Raising Canes. I could eat it every day but I don't wanna get fat. The strips are always juicy and the sweet tea is just the right amount of sweetness, but the winner is the Texas toast."}
{"text":"I loved loved loved their chicken fingers!! It was my first time trying this heart attack in a plate and I was pleasantly surprised by its simplicity. Chicken strips, fries, a piece of bread, and some dipping sauce. Sounds pretty simple but the combination is truly orgasmic. The chicken was cooked to perfection with the right amount of batter. Crispy and yet very soft and tender. The fries were also really good, enough to finish the entire plate, although I did not dare. I didn't get a chance to try the sweet tea, but I'll take your word for it and say it was probably pretty damn good. Overall I had a great experience. I definitely see myself hitting this place up after a drunk night but they're only open till midnight. I guess I gotta go back to drinking at noon..."}
{"text":"Very glad Cane's made their way to Arizona...it was one thing I missed about living in Las Vegas! It's not close to home, but always worth the drive for fresh, hot and delicious food and great service. The staff is friendly, the restaurant is clean and it is cheap comfort food."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and I drive past this place on my way home. There ALWAYS seems to be a line wrapped around the building. So I was interested in what the heck they were serving to be so popular?! So, naturally I go!!  What I ordered: \"The Box\" Combo. (4 tenders, cole slaw, fries, tx toast and a drink) paid $8.09 after tax.  To be honest, I was very underwhelmed. I waited 16 mins from the time I entered the drive thru line to when I pulled off (was prepared for a wait though so no big deal)  I thought the chicken was just okay. Not bad, just not amazing. Kind of lacked in flavor to the batter. Was fresh though.   The sauce was interesting. Kind of like a ranch mixed with a drop of BBQ sauce and a ton of black pepper. But it worked.   The toast tasted like a toasted hamburger bun to me.  Fries were thin and average--but not bad.  I got the lemonade, which apparently costs extra-- bland in taste.   I ate all my food,  but I wouldnt come back."}
{"text":"I only ordered the chicken. It was excellent, juicy without a hint of oiliness or greasiness, crispy outside, tender inside without being \"mushy.\"  Sauces and fries lend themselves more to personal tastes, so even though I sneaked some off my wife's plate, I won't comment on them but I believe pretty much anyone who had the chicken I had would give it the highest marks. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Price was $1.09 per piece and in my opinion worth it."}
{"text":"Great Place. Food is always fresh. The highlight of this specific location is the STAFF they are GREAT Sam is the man. Keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in to Cane's, the staff is so cheerful when they greet you! We have special requests when it comes to our order, and it is always prepared as requested, and so fresh! 5 stars everytime!"}
{"text":"Hit the spot.  My friend brought us some on his way over.  Everything was good.  I love good fried chicken, fries were good and coleslaw was great.  Have to try it next time I am in vegas."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Canes almost every week for the last 5 years. I have a debt card with my maiden last name that I have always used and it has always been fine, there are not many people with my name. After being in the er all night, I decided to get Canes and the manager there gave us hell. She said that since my last name didn't match I have to find something in my car that does. While I'm doing that she starts to argue with my husband. In 5 years, this location has never had a problem with my name on the cards. It is sad because I come there a lot, now that manager made me never want to return. I would've gave it 1 star but the food is so good."}
{"text":"I like the food here. And the service is always decent. But my order gets messed up every time. I order an extra sauce, and don't get the sauce. I order extra toast substituted for fries. And they substitute toast for the Cole slaw. Always something small messed up which is really disappointing because they have like 4 different items across their menu, in theory it shouldn't be hard to mess up. But not bad food."}
{"text":"I love their food, but every time I've gone in recently within the past three weeks, there's always this woman who is so incredibly obnoxious and rude. I believe she is the manager because she wears a green shirt. She is older, but she has constantly given the worst customer service. She has rolled her eyes at me, ignored me, etc. maybe she needs her staff to teach HER how to be a nice person, because they all are awesome."}
{"text":"Always great food. Thank you you made my belly happy.  I only get you a couple of times a yr. Thank you.."}
{"text":"I love the food, but customer service sucks. 3 different employees were rude.  Income in and use the restroom as I entered the door to the restrooms I see one of the employees holding a bag of trash so I hold the door open for her and she just walks by without saying thank you. As I was tearing the toilet up I'm pretty sure the same employee was banging on the door yelling she needs to clean out the restroom.  Like chill I'm trying to poop in peace.  After that I went to order and the girl who took my order was rude and handed me my change rudely causing it to fall on the floor.  Lastly when I went to pick my order up, the lady giving my order was rude not caring in what I was trying to ask. Sigh, I hope the food taste good as last time."}
{"text":"Recommend this place for a hearty meal for a hangover. It's not too far away from the strip. It's probably about 5 blocks away and it's next to target. At first I thought it was going to be like a mom and pop kind of restaurant. But it is actually a small chain restaurant like KFC and Popeye's serving fried chickens without the bones. The place was very clean and every time you need to use the bathroom you need to get the key.   Service: friendly and quick.  Food: The meal is simple and not much to choose from. There is type 4 type of combo meals that comes in a box. Every combo comes with number of chicken fingers or a chicken sandwich. The side is French fries, Texas Toast, special sauce, coleslaw, and large drink.   Recommendations:  I love their Texas Toast, Its warm soft and buttery not too overwhelming. Also, comes with the combo meal. To me the chicken tenders are fresh not from a bag and juicy."}
{"text":"I had Raising Cane's twice on my trip. Its so good! The second time was better! My nieces suggested Texas toast and dripping sauce with our next Tiporder.    Tip: If you came here I recommend that includes a little of everything(fries,chicken fingers,texas toast and  dripping sauce)  The closes Raising Cane is in Orange County(welp rip me)"}
{"text":"If you want some of the best chicken tenders ever, come here!  Been here a few times and have gotten the tenders, fries, texas toast and lemonade.  The tenders are to die for!  Nicely breaded but not so breaded that it overpowers the chicken.  Tastes like real chicken, not any processed crap.  Nice and hot, great taste.  And the dipping sauce they give you is amazing!  That stuff is addicting.  The crinkle cut fries are nothing special but very solid.  Not bad by any means but just  nothing to write home about.  The texas toast doesn't look like anything special but its actually very good.  I'd recommend laying a tender on the toast and having an open-faced sandwich.  They say the lemonade is fresh squeezed, I didn't really believe it but I love a good lemonade so I ordered it even though it was an extra $.30.  OH MY GOD BEST 30 CENTS I HAVE EVER SPENT!  They are not lying when they say it is fresh squeezed.  Easily some of the best lemonade I have ever had.  The pricing is pretty decent for what you are getting.  Their 6 tender meal with 3 sides (fries, toast and cole slaw are advertised but you can substitute any of them for extra of something else.  I get either extra fries or toast in place of slaw), 2 sauces and a large drink is going to come out to around 8 or 9 bucks.  Could be a little cheaper for the amount you are getting but the quality of the food justifies it.  My only real complaint is that they need to give out more sauce!  If the worst thing about this place is they need to give out more of their fantastic sauce, I'd say it's a place worth trying.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So THIS is where all the cool high school kids hang on a Friday night... I've never felt more like an old person. Hah! Cane's is great, it's something I go out of my way for when the chicken finger craving strikes. Love the Christmas Story theme they're rocking for the holiday."}
{"text":"I enjoy the chicken fingers and sauce with the sweet tea - but that's it!  I love good slaw, but theirs in runny and bland. I don't like their toast because it is not \"toasted.\" I can't stand their fries because they are too soft and often cold.   When I order the Caniac (6 fingers, slaw, fries, toast), I feel like I am wasting part of my money due to the fact that I don't like three of the items it comes with. So, often I order just the chicken meals platters. Then, I go to In-N-Out across the street for good fries.  The service is not consistently good - often I have witnessed patrons being treated poorly. The store and the staff are often not equipped to handle requests or simple questions.  3-stars for the chicken fingers and sweet tea!"}
{"text":"I recently visited this location on April 4th and ordered Caniac combo my fries where soggy and old tasting i called the store and spoke to a manger he took my name down and said he would replace my food. So today April 12, 2018 I decide to stop by to get my order replace and Matt told me my name was not on the list and because i had a picture of my receipt theres nothing he could do. I asked him if he can pull it up by the check number he said no he asked me when i called what race did i talk to i said I'm not sure it was over the phone and not in person. Since i could give him the race of the person or my actually receipt he could not do anything for me . And he was very rude about"}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders I've ever had and I love me some chicken tenders. A little pricey but chicken tenders aren't exactly cheap. You get your money's worth here. Good tenders with good sauce with good tea. The fries are okay the bread is good and the sla needs some adjustments in my opinion. But if you like tenders this is the place"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service! The manager on duty, an older gentlemen, was super nice and friendly!! :) We came in a little late close to closing, but he didn't rush us or anything. We felt very welcomed! definitely coming back regularly!!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of being in The South where this chain is from. And, they taste just like the ones there. This plans destroys all the other fast food chicken tender places in Vegas. Yes, destroys. And, their sweet tea and Canes sauce is the bomb! Great fast food meal and cheap."}
{"text":"So happy Canes is in Vegas! Def my favorite chicken finger spot. Multiple choices and you really can't go wrong with their menu! Buttery Texas toast, Crispy crinkle cut fries, juicy chicken, tangy dipping sauce, and sweet tea to top it off!"}
{"text":"Oh man so great! One of the first places we hit when we landed. They have also finally released nutrition facts after all these years! The sauce is the best part, chicken second!!"}
{"text":"This is an interesting place. I'm from Southern California and we don't have Raising Canes there. However, I'm a big fan of chicken fingers so my boyfriend took me here. I'm only giving it 3 stars for the following reason... when I was ordering, I asked the waitress to tell me about the secret sauce. I'm picky about my sauces. I prefer ranch and honey mustard so I was just asking her about it. Her response was well it's a secret sauce so I can't tell you what's in it. I didn't ask what's in it. I wanted to know is it spicy, mild, creamy? That pissed me off so I was in a bad mood by the time I got my food. I don't appreciate getting attitude from a 17 year old kid. It was my first time there. I was just asking a question. My food was good, but the girl at the counter ruined the moment for me with her attitude.  If you love chicken fingers like I do, then I recommend this place if you're in the area. Just don't expect fabulous service."}
{"text":"The line for to go is crazy! But we ate inside anyways and got our food fairly quickly! This was our first time here seeing as San Diego doesn't have a location. The chicken here is good! Better than theme park chicken tenders for sure lol.   I got the 4 piece box and it came with fries, coleslaw (which I thought was too heavy on the mayo), and toast. It was worth it!"}
{"text":"Love coming to this place the food is good the drive thru is fast and the staff are really friendly"}
{"text":"What can I say? The chicken, The chicken is just great! It can get really packed, but that's just because it's good tasting food. Everyone needs to try this place at least once"}
{"text":"This girl will eat at Cane's whenever and wherever she can because they still inexplicably haven't come to Wisconsin.   I loved that this was right outside the airport and easy to get in and out of. We got in late and it was later feeling for us with the time change. We just wanted something we knew would be quick and delicious before heading off to our lodging and my husband knows how much I love Cane's.   The staff was very friendly and fun, the restaurant was clean and the food, as always, was delicious."}
{"text":"Horrible outpost of a decent chain. Staff is unprofessional. We could hear them talking inappropriately throughout the entire restaurant. Screaming and laughing. Employees also sit in parking lot and harass people walking by.  Raising Cane's is alright this place sucks."}
{"text":"came in right before closing and thought it would leftover stuff already made but they made everything fresh and super hot.The fries were cooked to order which was nice, not sure if they always do that or just at night."}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious! The chicken fingers were just right. The sauce was good. The fries could step up it up a bit tho. I really did enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Best fast food ever.  Chicken tenders are perfectly fried and served up hot.   Lemonade is the bomb. Buy a gallon.   This store is super neat and clean and the drive thru is always quick.   Skip the in and out.  Get down w some real lunch here."}
{"text":"Not really much to say that everybody already said about raising canes the chicken is delicious love the fries and the texas toast that they give you with sauce is okay at best wish they had ranch but it is what it is love the service as well and it is one of my favorite places chicken that is to eat at I still love the Charleston location but this comes second out of the raising canes location so if you haven't tried this place out I recommend you to give it a shot."}
{"text":"I love this place my girlfriend took me here one day for the first time and ive been hooked ever since this is my go to place. The sauce is really good as well as the chicken tenders they were fresh and had a really good taste to it and omg the fries were soo good that I was eating my girlfriends extra fries if you havent tried raising canes yet I recommend you give it a try you will be hooked as I was when I was first introduced to it and the customer service is excellent to can't stress that enough."}
{"text":"This location, like the others i have visited, was a pleasant experience. the staff was friendly, my order did not take too long, the food was hot and delicious. cane's fingers are on another level of greatness."}
{"text":"We got addicted to this place when we were working in Vegas for a few months so my husband and I were stoked when we spotted this location.  The service was exceptional as all raising canes experiences for us have been, the chicken is hot and juicy, the Cane's sauce yummy, and the sweet tea perfection!!! Wish they would open in California!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service!  Food was delicious, and the sweet tea just right!  Wish we lived in the area so we could go weekly! =)"}
{"text":"went here on a sunday afternoon and it was crackin!   I personally like KFC better for my friend chicken fix, but this place was decent. It's basically a fast food joint with the standard chicken fixins. cole slaw, fries, fried chicken, chicken burgers, chicken fingers, etc.   BUT! they have this sauce that looks like thousand island mixed with something spicy. this sauce also may have crack in it because it's so damn good. the sauce makes their dishes awesome!"}
{"text":"First, TEXAS TOAST here is AMAZING! The best texas toast! This is the best place to go to if you are hungry and want something quick. It is cheap and very filling. The sauce with the chicken is really yummy too. I've only been here twice and both times my chicken were pretty juicy. I will definitely be back when I vacation in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Bomb! The chicken here is moist and very tender. Super good breading, best place for that southern type of chicken. Lemonade and the Cane's sauce is also a great addition to the chicken. ASU is being repped in here which is nice too."}
{"text":"Please build some RAINSING CANE'S franchise here in So Cal.   I had an awesome late night 11pm drive-thru experience here.  Ordered THE CANIAC COMBO which was A LOT OF FOOD (1st STAR). It had 6 chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, 2 Cane's sauce, Texas toast, and large drink.  The service wasn't as fast as expected probably because THE FOOD WAS HOT AND FRESH when it was served (2nd STAR). The drive-thru SERVER WAS REALLY FRIENDLY AND ATTENTIVE (3rd STAR). The chicken fingers were JUICY, TENDER, AND TASTY (4th STAR). Their sauce tasted like bbq sauce but we a tiny different kick to it that makes it uniquely delicious.  COLESLAW AND TOAST AREN'T USUALLY INCLUDED IN A CHICKEN FINGERS/STRIPS MEAL but they do at Cane's (5th STAR).   DEFINITELY A MUST-GO-TO RESTAURANT WHENEVER I VISIT LAS VEGAS!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend tried this place today and got sick immediately after eating here."}
{"text":"I told you I would do this lol. Raising Canes is the best by far place to get chicken tenders. I've been in LV for years and I have been coming to this location for years. Loyal customer right? Right. My disappointment today lies with the management and drive thru staff. I waited over 15 minutes in the drive thru for my order only to get a drink that tasted like garbage. What good is having food when you have nothing to drink. So after wasting time, money, and gas I call to get to some justification cause I feel like I just threw my money away. First I speak with Ryan. Being honest, I tell him that my time and money are valuable and my drink taste like shit! And to excuse my words so there is no question later if he feels disrespected. More or less I'm mad I had to sit for so long because they got the orders confused. This what I was told when I finally paid for the order. But this dude gets indignant and instead of offering to replace my order in full for my time and inconvenience he offers only to replace my drink. Of course I don't except this type of disrespect and I speak with David. He is the GM for a reason and he offers to replace my order because at the end of the day there was a mess up. But what I didn't like is that neither one of these gentlemen took ownership of the problem and speaking to David he tried the guilt trip route because I said SHIT! IM PRETTY SURE RYAN TALKS SHIT WITH HIS FRIENDS WHEN HES NOT AT WORK. Is this because I'm a black woman. Is this how you treat people of color? I'm pretty sure if I were Caucasian and said SHIT! there would have been no problem. I'm paying my money and contributing to your establishment and this is the treatment I get. No wonder I don't see to many colored faces working there. You're still going to replace my order. But next time put more energy into correcting your team and not your customers. Because contrary to disbelief I pay you....you don't pay me."}
{"text":"They forgot my order somehow  Was wondering what went on after 20minutes and people way after me got their orders and I didn't.   Love the place but, the service has been getting a tad sad here."}
{"text":"When your wife is in the emergency room and is told she has to wait an hour at 11:00pm and says get good food now...this is the place to go to make her happy, thank you Canes. Do i really need to talk about the food, i mean driving it to her for 8 minutes and having that hot food scent in the car is torture...Also she loves eating their bag of ice like popcorn when shes pregnant...and after too."}
{"text":"I love canes but this is the worst location in las vegas . Staff is a joke . Waited 10 mins for my food came home to some burnt fries . Never going back to this location this isn't the first time i came here and the food wasn't up to par with the rest of the canes in the Las Vegas area . I didn't even get a receipt."}
{"text":"Checked this place out whIle I was in las Vegas I give about 3-4 hours away....  it's very clean  environment & the food was GREAT!!! Fries & tenders plus the bread is very tasty I also had their sweet tea it was pretty good. ill be back soon on my next trip highly recommend to the las Vegas visitor's plus their customer service was speedy & they were very nice"}
{"text":"My first visit ever to Cane's was today. I was in for a surprise that no one had warned me about... No Ranch Dressing in the building. I walked in, ordered chicken fingers and then learned they don't do ranch. Mind blown. I was so shocked I didn't ask what do you give people who can't do spices or what about kids. I just took the Cane Sauce and figured I would try it. The fingers were great. We both ordered a five piece combo. ( If I had known about the ranch issue I would have only ordered 3.) The chicken was crispy and arrived as promised hot and fast. The sauce is an okay flavor but one small container for five fingers is not cool. The Cole slaw tastes like KFC's.  The Texas toast is a nice change of pace. I will probably eat the food again but as a to go option. My hubby wants to try the chicken sandwich next. Service was pleasant, quick and he didn't laugh at my ranch shock. I will assume he is use to it. The restaurant was clean and staff was working to keep it that way. I can't tell you what the restroom looks like as they require a key and we didn't have the time to ask."}
{"text":"It was okay. I compare it to a place back home called Zaxby's. The girl suggested that I order the box so that i could taste all that they had. The tenders were normal tenders, the secret sauce helped them out. The coleslaw was not good. The fries were gross. The best part of the meal was the toast and lemonade."}
{"text":"Last trip to vegas , was on the way to the airport, Sadly on my way back to reality , I wanted a quick snack , I remembered Dena A. raving about this place . So a quick drive thru  was in order . The 3 finger combo was just what the Doctor Needed. Nice Kick to the chicken , Texas Toast was Excellent , some fries , and A diet coke . Go to go . Had that sucker gone before I was  back to drop off the Rental car."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Cane's. Service is top notch. Food is outstanding. They even open at 9am for an early chicken finger fix. The best."}
{"text":"There's something about fresh chicken tenders that aren't over battered, over fried, and over priced.  Three tenders, fries, sauce (oh, that sauce), Texas toast, and cole slaw for under $7.  You can get more tenders and more sauce, and the sandwich is also yummy.  I just wish we had this in California when I was growing up.  Oh, join the Caneiacs club while you're there for great deals."}
{"text":"Wish we had raising canes at home,  would come to Vegas for some Canes.  Really good food!"}
{"text":"Love the Simplicity of the menu (Chicken Tenders, fries, coleslaw and sliced bread) and quality of food!!! Best Chicken Tenders I've ever tasted and the Cane's Sauce is amazing!!!  2 Thumbs up"}
{"text":"We visited raising canes based on all the great reviews on yelp and we were not disappointed. We found a new favorite place to eat in Vegas!  chicken fingers are awesome! staff is friendly ...cant go wrong with this location!"}
{"text":"Food is always great, nothing wrong with that. This is the first time I had an extremely uncomfortable experience at the drive thru. The person \"Anastacia\" or whatever he called himself was very inappropriate with his comments & flirtation. The other employees made it even more uncomfortable with their loud laughing in the background. They just wanted to fuck with people last night. That person either needs to be professional or stop working the drive thru, period. I can't imagine the others uncomfortable/awkward experiences others must have had with this employee. Its all a big joke to the staff too. He probably always continues to make inappropriate comments to the customer as they drive away. Not professional at all. This is the only Canes (on Thomas) I've felt so uncomfortable at. I've been to many Canes & been served by males, females, people of both gay & straight orientation, of all races & I've never once was made to feel so Damn uncomfortable until Dec. 5th around closing time. Every Canes I go to I love. After last night, I don't want to go back to this location. Weird energy being put out there..."}
{"text":"The only fast food place I enjoy going to. Always has good customer service. Chicken is always fresh. Fries are good and bread is even better. If you get something with coleslaw and aren't a fan (like myself), sub it for toast! Cheap and delicious. Way better than popeyes and kfc"}
{"text":"I love chicken fingers, and Cane's does them right! The batter is light and crispy, not greasy, and the chicken is fresh and juicy. Coleslaw has good flavor, fries are hot and crispy. Fresh squeezed lemonade is good, though I like it a little tangier. The sauce is good, a little peppery.  I agree with other reviewers that more variety would be good, like a salad or some kind of vegetable.  I will definitely be back, because the chicken tenders are really good."}
{"text":"It was fast they had great customer service! And it was so packed in their but everything came out so good and fresh"}
{"text":"Excellent service, juicy, delicious chicken, love the fries, and the sauce! This is far better than Chick Fil A, in my opinion. Same class. But this place is simple. Chicken and sides. Not too many other things."}
{"text":"It's a chain, so if you've been to one all you need to know this is one is particularly clean and has great hours, but service can be slow when crowded.   If you are new to cane's the simple question to answer is can you eat chicken? No? Sorry, you're unlucky. Yes? Run, don't walk your way here! Chick-Fil-A can keep the chicken sandwich, these guys invented the chicken finger! Just get three things: chicken fingers, sweet tea, and sauce. The fries are ok, so is the toast, but really everything here is just filler. The sauce should be tested it's that addicting it's a little warm but not spicy and the sweet tea might be liquid sugar, but no part of your tongue will care. The chicken itself is juicy and will not last. Within minutes you will have a \"i ate the bones\" moment.  Faults? Price. After tax I spend around nine dollars which is a different tax bracket compared to most fast food, but it's a great occasional guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"***Update: I was reached out to by George the regional manager. He was very friendly and apologized for the rude service. His customer service was exceptional just like the service I've had at so many other Raising Cane's locations. I'm thankful he took the time to read my review and really hope this doesn't happen to anyone else. ***  I love canes. Normally they're quick, always  and very friendly. However, I highly do not suggest this location. We went to grab food and walked away with one box after we had ordered 2. I get it you're busy errors happen. But when we called after to let them know they missed an entire box of food. They treated us like liars! I'm sorry I am not lying for a mistake you made. We work in the food industry so we're pretty understanding but that is NOT how to treat anyone. I don't care how busy you are and if you \"think\" we're lying.   Not only that we asked for a water instead of a soda with one of our meals. Instead of giving us the bottle of water they charged us for it when it's inclusive in the combo....   I highly suggest you re-evaluate and retrain your staff if this is how they treat your customers."}
{"text":"First the good:  The Texas Toast.  The okay:  The chicken fingers, the fries.  The okay but over-hyped:  Canes sauce.  It tastes like BBQ sauce mixed with mayonnaise.  Now, the bad:  The place is way too noisy.  The muzak (up-to-date, but STILL muzak) is blasting.  The restaurant itself amplifies the din with hard floors, walls and ceiling.  And then the patrons seem to find it essential to shout at one another over the already intolerable noise.  It never occurs to people that I really DO NOT CARE about their personal issues with a family member or coworker, and I sure in blazes don't want to HEAR about it.  More bad:  I don't care if Maryland and Tropicana ARE homeless central.  When I need to/want to use the restroom, I shouldn't have to go request a key from the cashier.  I won't return, no matter how hungry I get, and not even to give Cane's another chance because of the locked restrooms."}
{"text":"This place is bomb. Their sweet tea is like crack - delicious!  Please come to California!"}
{"text":"These are the best chicken fingers I've ever had...and the dipping sauce? So delicious. I'm a big fan of the bread and fries too, although the coleslaw is a little on the sweet side for me. Oh! And the iced tea is perfect...I mix the sweetened with the unsweetened and it's the best. I've been here a few times and the service is always fantastic. The employees are friendly and personable. It's always clean even when it's busy. It's one of my go-to places for sure."}
{"text":"Eating the Buffet of Buffets for the past 24 hours was exhausting...so we decided to go somewhere near UNLV. (Literally right across from Target).   While driving by this fast food restaurant, I noticed that there was a drive-thru as well as a sitting area inside. Of course I decided to go inside to check it out. The interior was quite interesting. There were Halloween decorations and awesome ceiling fans that look like an airplane wing fan.   We were greeted promptly and ordered the 3 piece combo and the caniac combo. The 3 piece combo came with their special sauce that tasted like thousand island (disappointed that the employee lied to me when I specified if there was thousand island and she denied it and said that they could not tell me what was placed into this sauce...So...Yes, I had an allergic reaction to this...) Thank you lady...Anyways, this also came with Texas bread, fries and a drink. The Texas bread was excellent because it tasted like a Hawaiian bread that was soft and not too buttery. The fries wasn't all that great, but it was ok though. The sweet tea was not as good as Popeyes...it was kind of bitter. Maybe they accidentally mixed the unsweetened iced tea with the sweet tea?   The caniac combo meal came with the same items stated above as well as coleslaw. The coleslaw was a bit drenched in the sauce; however, the cabbage wasn't soggy and limp but crispy still. I enjoyed eating this side. Lastly, I didn't mentioned how the chicken tenders tasted yet because I wanted to save it for last! OMG! THE BEST CHICKEN TENDERS that I have ever eaten so far. Wow! The seasoning was just perfect and the batter was nice and light. The chicken breast was fresh and not frozen because it was all white meat and not those dark looking frozen meats. The chicken was so juicy and tender...I kind of wished that I got the party size now...  All I have to say is that Yelpers...This is a restaurant that you must try in Las Vegas! Something quick and simple for you late Vegas arrivals or even locals.   Note: You have to ask for the key to use the restroom."}
{"text":"This location is the best in Las Vegas. The manager Brent is super cool and extremely helpful. The staff is so nice and they give you a warm welcome as soon as you walk in. The food and cleanliness of the place has never let me down. Food is always delicious and my order is always correct and the place is constantly being cleaned. I love coming here."}
{"text":"Old reliable.  Never had a complaint with the food or the service.  If I had a note about this location it would be that the afternoon sun can be a hassle depending on seating. Be it this location or any other locale,  always worth the wait, a great value."}
{"text":"Have been to this location many times, never had an issue.  Parking can be a pain, sometimes there's a line or wait for seating but overall a great meal for a pretty good value. Be it this location or any other locale,  definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Cane's is a good place to get lunch with friends and hang out. I almost always order a Caniac  (6 pcs of chicken, toast, fries, slaw, and sauce) I replace the slaw with toast because the fries are plenty for me and I don't like their slaw. After eating the whole box of food, I'm pretty stuffed. It's a bit pricey for chicken fingers, but I think it's worth it.  This location is usually pretty packed around lunch time, so be warned.  There's something about their caniac sauce and toast that makes me come back for more."}
{"text":"Other than this location almost always being bombarded by teenagers Cane's is amazing.  The customer service is always on point as well, they're always really friendly and I actually feel like the people here somewhat enjoy their job / the company they work for which is always great. If you want chicken fingers do not waste your time going to any other fast food place. Cane's chicken fingers are the best by far of any place I've had. Their sweet tea and dipping sauce are choice as well. I don't know what the heck they do to their toast but whatever it is , it's amazing :')  Not to mention it's cheap af. I love Cane's. They never disappoint me."}
{"text":"My brother just got hit with a piece of chicken in the neck by a group of travelers and management did not address the situation. The police was called but the group took off before they could arrive. Management did not even ask what was going on. Horrible experience!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying Raising Cane's and oh my!!! It was so yummy!! This is a must try for anyone who loves chicken. My husband and I ordered the sandwich and caniac combos. For the sandwich, substitute the regular Kaiser roll for the Texas toast. Made the meal that more delicious. Grand opening was really busy, however got our order in and food out within 10 min.  The staff were amazing. If you are looking for fantastic fried chicken, Raising Cane's is a must try."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Raising Cane.  The employees were super friendly and welcoming.  They rate 5 stars!  The food, however, was disappointing.  Even though the chicken was very moist and tender, it lacked any special flavor.  It needs some seasoning.  The fries were on the dry, stale side, but the bread and coleslaw were very good.  The next time I'm hungry for chicken, I'll stick with KFC with a choice of side dishes."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better chicken joints out there, as far as chain fast food goes. The Cane's sauce is amazing on both the chicken and the fries, and even though I try to eat as little bread as possible I always finish off the toast they give as part of the meal.  Chicken has always been tender and flavorful and is never dry at all. Fries are always crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  When I'm in a hurry and there's a Raising Cane's nearby, it's always on the short list. Definitely a go-to spot.   The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is ingredient quality. I mean, I know I'm eating at a fast food place. I didn't come here to be healthy, I know they don't source their potatoes from Whole Foods or their chickens from organic farms. And I'm okay with that. For what it is, this place is great."}
{"text":"Went there last night and got the caniac box and only at 2 pieces of chicken because it didn't taste right.... unfortunately I was right as they made me sick as soon as I got home about 45 mins later I was throwing up and then all night peeing out you know where... don't go here late night maybe they pay more attention to how they cook their food during the day but definitely not at night..."}
{"text":"Great Chicken Fingers. I frequently do a drive-thru & order the Caniac combo, 6 fingers, coleslaw, fry's & 32oz drink. The chicken fingers taste great & it's price is affordable. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Great chicken fingers!  Love the sweet tea and Texas toast. Limited menu but worth the drive."}
{"text":"RCCF is a great place to get a chicken finger fix.  Their fry sauce is awesome and tea supper sweet.  This particular location gets hopping around lunch time but the crew handles it well and turns out the fingers quickly."}
{"text":"If you like good food then you'll love Raising Canes! Don't let long lines get you down because they are really quick. The customer service is always on point whether I'm in the drive thru or eating in. They offer great portions and good prices.  Deliciously moist and always fresh chicken that comes with a side dipping sauce. Depending on what plate you ordered, your chicken will usually be accompanied by hot fries, coleslaw, and the best Texas toast you have ever had.  I recommend getting their sweet tea, they even have the delicious little crushed ice cubes.  Tip* Buy an additional sauce- you can thank me later."}
{"text":"It was so loud in the place we could not hear each other talk... We worked all day and wanted to enjoy our meal, but the manager never to charge of the situation and we had to say something to the kids... Granted they were not out tearing anything up but just being rude and over destructive! Until they can get this place under control eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Ketchup dispenser wasn't working went all not only myself but every customer that used it after I did.  A Team member comes over cleans the counter but does not say one word about the dispenser not working, nor did anyone put out of order sign and get packets.  This is unacceptable with many people coming in for lunch and ruining my shirt along with other customers clothes such as the gentleman with the suit that also got splattered on due to the pressure in the pump"}
{"text":"First of all it's right next to the freeway so it's hard to even turn in. Then you get there and there's limited parking cause it's soooo busy. Your options to order are Chicken fingers, chicken fingers and chicken fingers.(I understand it's a finger joint but lets have some other options) I order and the food comes out quick. The fingers aren't  even crispy and the sauce is some weird Thousand Island/Ranch/Peppercorn.Then the fingers are  Non-crispy! So you're saying you cant make the one thing you have on the menu?! So we're sitting at a large table for a little lunch business meeting and the Manager comes up to us and with a snarky tone brings up that we have to pay by the minute. Hahahaha. One of those, \"I'm kidding but not kidding\" kind of remarks. Crowd was casual biz. Don't recommend it and don't see what the hype is about."}
{"text":"Mess up my order every time I visit this location... I must be a glutton for punishment as I keep returning for more..."}
{"text":"Once you've raised some Cane's you'll never go anywhere else again!  Amazingly fresh, authentic, and the sauce is terific!"}
{"text":"How can you not love Raising Canes sauce?! The best thing about my trip to Vegas was that our Airbnb was only minutes away from here. I had to stop here all weekend. There was one particular employee we tipped because his service was incredible. I wish I had gotten his name. The menu is pretty simple and basic. They have the bombest sweet tea and lemonade. At this location, I've never encountered a crazy line like I do on a regular basis at the locations in Cali. Would definitely recommend if you need something quick and filling."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service.  We stopped in on a Friday night and the drive-thru looked a bit chaotic.  Wanting the tasty chicken fingers and delicious fry sauce, we pulled in away.  The line moved right along and all employees from whom ever took the order to the one giving use  the bounty were happy and highly personable.  THis particular day was very warm and I downed my sweet tea in a matter of seconds.  The gentleman at the window was very kind to refill my cup with absolutely no attitude what so ever.  The only challenge for me now that I am in the NW is to not stop by here every day."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. The chicken fingers here are not brought in on a truck frozen they are made fresh. The chicken is seasoned nice and I like to add their hot sauce to the sandwich combo they have. The coleslaw was not good in my opinion and the fries are good if you eat them right away but don't hold up well if you get your order from the drive thru and eat at home. Decent option from the usual burger fast good options."}
{"text":"Amazing flavors!  I wish that they had locations in California.  They didn't have ranch, but their flavors made up for it."}
{"text":"I have been to Raising Cane from Vegas to California and I would definitely come to Raising Cane again the chicken here is so good and a french fries is so good also."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool! I like the actual restaurant. The decor is awesome and I like their disco ball! Good music for college students and perfect location for ASU students!  The food is delicious but would def not eat it regularly. Super greasy (would be great after a night on Mill tho). The chicken fingers were fresh and all white meat. Super crispy! And the sauce goes well with it. There is a copious amount of fries that went with the meal. Btw I ordered the Caniac. 6 chicken fingers, texas toast (which was bomb but also greasy) , cole slaw, and a pile of fries. And a large drink.  when I say greasy though...its not swimming in oil. Just the right amount of grease i think. It could get salty but the coleslaw cuts the saltiness. Perfect balance.  Would definitely comeback! I wanna try their sandwiches!  The combo meal I got came out to 8.98... Kinda pricey but it fed me and my sister pretty well.   3.5 stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"They always have the place clean. Great chicken tender and juicy! Lemon aid is delicious. Service is great and fast!"}
{"text":"If you asked me to choose between Raising Canes & Chick-fil-a. Coming from California i'd pick Raising Canes because we just started getting Raising Canes locations out there. So glad they built one close & up in Summerlin, im waiting for the In-N-Out to be built next to it, lol jk. Concept of their menu is so simple there is really no tough decision except how many sides and fingers do you want? This location's drive thru can get really busy, i always find it best to go in an order to go :) Sauce is the boss, toast is the most & the chicken is kicking!!"}
{"text":"I dont usually write any reviews on yelp but what I experienced today at this location made me really upset. I been to this location more than 10 times since it is located right next to where i live and everytime i came here all of the workers were friendly and nice but today was very different. I ordered the box combo and the caniac combo both with Sprite(Drive thru), but the lady gave me 1 sprite and 1 sweet tea and my brother was sitting next to me and said this isnt sprite so i asked for Sprite and then she gave me attitude towards me and didnt even look at my face when she gave me a new drink and the food. I still said thank u since those mistakes are understandable but she just ignored me and closed the window.  AND GUESS WHAT, SHE STILL GAVE ME THE FREAKIN SWEET TEA AGAIN. Idk if she did that intentionally or the drink machine was broken.. but whatever it is, that lady was like the rudest worker that i've ever met at that location. Idk if i can say her name on here but her name is Lad*****."}
{"text":"We had 10 people and ordered the 25 piece chicken, fries, and coleslaw and it was a sufficient amount of food. Really good deal for the amount of people we had. Quick service and overall great experience."}
{"text":"FINALLY!  I finally satisfied my craving for Raising Cane's after 7 long, grueling years!  Let me tell you, it was every bit worth the wait!  I trudged through the cold and rain to get here!  I ordered the box:  4 tenders, cole slaw, fries, Texas toast, and a drink.  MMmmmmmm...they're every bit as good as I remembered!  I opted to take full advantage of my experience at eat alone inside the restaurant (I normally don't dine solo - I would rather get it to-go).  The interior was very nice and clean, the staff was friendly.  It didn't take very long to get my food, which was  a plus.  I had just taken the red-eye from Honolulu the night before and hadn't eaten a thing since the day before and it was almost 4pm so needless to say, I was pretty famished.  This may be blasphemy, but I know Cane's is known for its Cane sauce.  But just as I had expected, I really am not a fan of the Cane sauce.  Plus, to me, the tenders are delicious enough by themselves (and I am a condiment-holic, be it Ranch or mayonnaise).  I did get some mayo for my fries, though.  Funny thing, the only fries on this earth that I eat without dipping them into anything are McDonald's.  Back to Cane's....great food, great service.  SO glad I was able to make it down to Cane's during one of my many weekend trips to Vegas.  Hoping I can stop in again the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Alright what petition do I have to sign to make Raising Cane's open up shop in California?   I love that there isn't a lot to choose from, like other fast food joints, because it means they're doing something right with just a limited menu!  Ordered the $8.29 Caniac combo, which comes with 6 chicken fingers, 1 Texas toast, fries, cole slaw, and a large drink, and that was even too much for my boyfriend and I to share. Maybe it's because we opted to double the fries instead of getting cole slaw. maybe it's because I drank too much of their delicious sweet tea. Maybe it was because I dipped the perfectly seasoned, lightly breaded chicken fingers in their delicious Cane's sauce. But whatever reason it was, we spent less than $10 for a meal and still had leftovers so I really can't complain.   Our wallets went home empty after gambling on the strip but our stomachs went home happy."}
{"text":"The young staff is friendly, energetic, and very polite. Each time I've been here, someone's always working lobby making sure everything is cleaned up. You'll be surprised that they don't offer traditional sauces such as bbq and honey mustard, but their in-house sauce is delicious and compliments the chicken well. Great place if you're just wanting a simple chicken strip and french fries bite."}
{"text":"So I have to update because I've been inside to eat twice now and both times my expectations were not met. Food was delicious as usual but the tables are never clean! It's fast paced so people are in and out and tables are left greasy and dirty. It has to be known by employees that it is fast paced and they should be on top of it when it comes to dining room cleanliness. We waited and finally had to ask someone to clean the only place we could find to sit down and eat (dinner hour is pretty crowded) and she was not excited to clean our table. She had a poor attitude about it but when she looked around she started cleaning other tables. The food is so good here if you're craving chicken but I recommend drive thru."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's has to be some of the best Fried Chicken strips available out there today. I frequent this particular \"Cane's\" on Flamingo whenever I have the urge to step off my diet. Now remember, this is Fried Chicken, so if you eat it occasionally, it won't be too bad for you.   I recommend ordering number 1 or number 3. Three is the largest box of strips and fries, but can easily be shared with another person. Of course, I have friends that can pound the number 3 by themselves, but I am a lightweight I guess. Number 1 is just about right and is worth the price. Also, if you are a student or police officer of some sort, you can definitely get a discount on your meal. I think it's about 70 cents.   Give it a try because it's not like any of those other Fried chickens you find out there."}
{"text":"I was hoping I'd like this a little bit more - it's not terrible, especially for the price.   This place is great for speed and price because they only serve one thing... chicken strips. They're lightly breaded and are served with fries, garlic toast and a tiny side of coleslaw. There's only one type of dipping sauce for the chicken strips (Cane's sauce), ketchup for the fries (unless you put ketchup on your chicken).    Overall it's good but I can't see myself craving it. I think I prefer Popeye's, but because I like the spicy chicken and a better sauce selection."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!!!  Tasty chicken fingers, fries and Texas Toast along with delicious dipping sauce.  Fast and friendly service. My whole family likes going to Cane's, so what more can I say.  If you want something different than the normal burgers and fries, Raising Cane's is a great choice.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Such friendly staff and Management. Food is always fresh and hot, doesn't feel like it's been sitting there all day. We'll definitely be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy a good chx finger but this time, I got three a la cart chx fingers and they were extremely small for $1.29/each. Not sure what's going on but I was extremely disappointed. Flavor was still good as ever, the crispiness is tasty and they come hot out of the fryer. I give it another shot and a second review some time later."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of chx fingers, you've got to give this a try. The chx is fresh and moist and the batter is light and crispy. The size portion of chx fingers are generous. The cane sauce took some getting use to but it has won my heart. The Texas size toast is decent, the cole slaw better than the usual and the fries are just ok. The sweet tea is way to sweet so I ask for 1/2 and 1/2 tea-water and it's just the right mixture. Join the Caniac club and get freebies and promotions."}
{"text":"Great service.  Great food.  Great prices.  Great everything.  Raising Canes is the greatest!"}
{"text":"Delish. That's the one word that comes to mind when I think of my experience at Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers.  The menu and concept is simple. Chicken Fingers. Everything else is sides such as fries, cole slaw and an extra helping of awesome.  I popped into this location last night with some LA friends. We were hungry after an epic BBQ and Pool Party and needed to go someplace quick before our trip to the Downtown Cocktail Room (see my review on DCR).  I had the \"most popular\" box meal. 4 Chicken Fingers, Crinkle Cut fries, Texas Toast, a side of slaw, and a drink. Effing amazing. All of it. Probably really unhealthy, but my several spin classes and high mileage running this week will burn it off, so who cares.  Couple things that made the experience epic. Real crushed ice. Coke Zero in the soda fountain. Sweet tea. And the special secret dipping sauce.  This place is worth the drive, walk, stumble or whatever. Get your ass here now. Trust me. It'll change your outlook on life."}
{"text":"Embrace your inner CANIAC!  I've reviewed a Raising Cane's location before, but today I had some time to kill before a meeting, so I decided to pop in to RC's. My Dad was with me, and it was his first time at this fine establishment. He can write his own review, but I know it will mimic mine.  This place is legit. Everything is made to order. The menu is pretty simple. Chicken Fingers, Fries, or a sandwich with Chicken Fingers and Fries. That's about it.  It's pretty much the best fried food out there. Yes, its a little unhealthy, but who gives a rat's ass. The chicken is marinated for 24 hours, nothing is frozen, and....you get Texas Toast!!  I got the famous Box: 4 chicken fingers, crinkle cut fries, slaw, Texas toast, and a drink. All for about 7 bucks. Not bad, considering this is pretty much the best meal you can have in the QSR (quick service restaurant) world.  Also, you must try the secret sauce. I don't know what's in it, and I don't care. It's amazing. Think of a peppery, tangier version of fry sauce (google it).   Since you may be thirsty, get the awesome lemonade. Fresh squeezed. Served in ice pellets. The only way to roll.  I have friends that went to school at Florida State University. A fine University that I respect just as much as my beloved University of Utah. I know many Seminoles will rave about Guthrie's. Not entirely sure if this place is a knockoff, but if you like Guthries, I imagine you'd like RC. Same menu, same concept. Except in Vegas.  Hop to it, Noles and Yelpers alike. This is one of my favorite establishments....anywhere!  P.S. If you are wondering where it stands against Chick-Fil-A....who different ballgame."}
{"text":"The moment I ate my first piece, it was love in my tummy!  O-M-G the Texas Toast, the chicken.... I devoured everything in my box, and I wanted more.  The only thing that sucked was that we wanted to get some for the ride home, but they were closed early for a company picnic.  But the next time I go to Vegas I will be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"best chicken wings around. the sweet tea is amazing. the only negative is that it is always so crowded! It can be hard to find a seat!"}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Raising Canes for a while..alot of hype around it.  What I found out....  The staff is fun and friendly..the place has a gimmick and thats its selling point.  The food, not great, but definitely not awful. I would say you HAVE to want chicken tenders to want to go to RC.  Lastly I have to say the place is overall a disappointment, its a spot for a young crowd but the food doesnt live up to the hype. I prefer Churches!"}
{"text":"Meh.  The food was just ok.  I guess I expected a bit more flavor from the tenders and maybe a variety of different dipping sauces to choose from for my tenders.  Cane's own sauce was ok.  My kids did not care for it.  The Texas toast and fries were good."}
{"text":"That sauce is straight up worse than black tar heroin. I'll get a bucket of that sauce and just dunk a whole piece of Texas toast in there. And they got the good ice!"}
{"text":"First time there today and it was amazing! Menu was simple and straight forward. I ordered \"The Box\" which included 4 chicken tenders, fries, texas toast, coleslaw , signature sauce, and a drink.  I suggest the Sweet Tea.   Pros: Location, Discount for UNLV students, Service, Food, Music, and Cleanliness; Not in any particular order.  Cons: N/A"}
{"text":"Delicious as usual. And great location  closer to home. Chicken is moist, fries crispy, toast is delicious.awesome disco ball"}
{"text":"Cashier on aug 8 at 1:40 with glasses gave me good customer service but she seemed very shy... Maria knows how to cook them chicken fingers real good."}
{"text":"For specializing in chicken I felt it was lacking in flavor... There is no seasoning. Chicken was all white meat and very fresh but just like food you could make at home. They don't carry ranch for the chicken/fries only their famous canes sauce or honey mustard neither of which I like the taste of.. Reason for 3 stars was excellent customer service and very clean and well kept inside. ps my b-friend did like the canes sauce tho. Prob won't return... no real reason to."}
{"text":"Love their food, especially their sauce! Best place ever...we stop by every time we visit Vegas...wish there was one in California"}
{"text":"Awesome chicken. It is not frozen at all and tasted so good. Get extra sauce cause it is so good."}
{"text":"Fast Food Chicken Fingers never tasted so good. Raising Canes specializes in southern style chicken strips that come complete with Texas toast, cole slaw, and french fries. The cane sauce is delicious and don't forget the sweet tea."}
{"text":"This place sucks, honestly customer service is trash. Worst experience ever. Don't come here. Doesn't even deserve a star."}
{"text":"Favorite joint. Fast service, great hot food. The cooks always do it right! Never had any issues with this location."}
{"text":"Yummy chicken fingers, great sauce and friendly service!  I really like this chain that has only recently entered the Valley. The restaurants are nice and clean, decorated in fun style with movie posters and other pop culture memorabilia on the wall. Each restaurant also seems to support its local high school sports teams and many of the workers likely come from those schools.  Service has been very friendly, you order and they bring the food to your table. Going through the drive-through is very quick as well.  As for the food, they keep the menu simple: chicken fingers, fries, and Texas toast. The breading on the chicken fingers is tasty and I really love the special dipping sauce they provide - not sure how to describe the flavor except that its really good.  Overall, Raising Cane's is a great addition to the Valley's fast food scene."}
{"text":"It's the in-n-out of chicken! (if that makes sense) It's delicious, cheap, and the service is great."}
{"text":"Chicken is kickin, sauce is the boss, the toast is the most [finish their catchy slogan here]!  Definitely a fan of this busy, fast food joint! Chicken tender is always moist and breaded just right. I've noticed that the sauce has changed over the years but still very good! The toast, coleslaw, and crinkle-cut fries are also great sides! CARB & FAT overload!  WARNING : MAY come with regret! :P"}
{"text":"I freak'n love this place! So tasty and I get their honey mustard sauce ... I go to this at least 3 times a month"}
{"text":"Drive-Thru Line is always around the block.  Need say nothing more.  It is the sauce.  The breading on the chicken is above-average but not necessarily enough to wait in line.  It is the Cane's Sauce that makes all the difference."}
{"text":"Ahhh...Raising canes - the Chick-fil-a of Las Vegas. I do miss thy scrumptious chicken fingers!  Esp now that I see in my email that I am entitled to a free box combo with the purchase of another one..shniff.  Too bad I cant be back there til June. sigh"}
{"text":"I am slightly concerned that I have a list for Raising Cane's and I've never reviewed this location. I've been here many times after day-drinking, and I must say....Cane's is the business.  The chicken is so moist, and juicy. It makes you want to do nasty things to it. Ok, maybe I took it a little too far. Yeah. Sorry.  It's delicious, the Texas Toast is awesome, and the sauce will make your mouth smile.  Go there now.  Love,  Me"}
{"text":"The chicken and fries are OK but my kids go for the bread and the dipping sauce, lol.  I don't care for it at all.  The chicken is on the bland side and needs the sauce to make it yummy.    The staff is always nice.  The restaurant is casual."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Raising Cane's ever since I first tried them at a booth at Bite of Las Vegas back in 2007. It is a blessing and a curse that this particular location is in the same shopping center as my work. It is amazing to see how much this business has grown. I remember when there were only 2 locations and now there are 7! It is no surprise considering that the food is so good. The menu is so basic, but it packs a little punch. The selection is variable, but a basic combo contains chicken fingers, fries, texas toast, coleslaw, and dipping sauce.   The chicken is always cooked to perfection. (Except for during my last visit when it was overdone, but that was Black Friday and they were busy, so I guess I'll overlook that this time.) There is also a chicken sandwich available. It's just a sandwich with chicken tenders tucked inside.   The crinkle cut fries are a little bland, but a little ketchup can always help that. Their texas toast is freaking amazing! A little crispy around the edges, soft and buttery in the middle. I'm not a big fan of coleslaw, so whenever I order, I always replace my coleslaw with an extra slice of texas toast. And that is the beauty of this place! If you find that you don't like something, you can always replace it with something else!   The Cane's sauce is unlike any other dipping sauce I have ever tried. It kind of looks like thousand island, but the flavor is hard to explain. I have always loved it, but if you're not a fan, they have honey mustard available.   This particular location always has great customer service. I primarily use the drive thru and always chat it up with the cashiers. They are so nice and friendly. Give Cane's a try if you haven't already! They have grown for a reason!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing best chicken strips ever forget about Popeyes I want a raising canes in Cali!!!"}
{"text":"How can you give anything but five stars? Service is swift no matter how busy. Chicken is phenomenal and they have the best ice tea. Employees always seem happy and have a smile on their face."}
{"text":"Nice fresh and hot and juicy. This is a must go to when in town. It's like every thing is fresh out the fryer. Drive Thur wasn't busy at all and it's super close to the strip. Win win. I didn't get any pics but of the empty box. I smashed that chicken and didn't think to look back!!!!"}
{"text":"They are friendly here . Food is always fresh  and hot. The raising cane sauce ticks!!"}
{"text":"Henderson has a Raising Cane's..Yay!!!  Shirley B. doesn't really care for it... Boo!!! #SorryNotSorry!  Only reason why I'm here was because I opened my big mouth and told Mr B. He thinks this place is just awesome... smh..   Not going to waste your time going into detail again about my personal tastes. If you want to know scan thru my other RC review.   There was no line when we arrived, short wait time for our order but the closer it crept to the dinner hour the busier it got. By the time we left and walked outside, the cars circled around the building! Insane!   I get why people dig Raising Canes though. Lots of white meat in their fingers, Texas Toast, plenty of Crinkle Fries, side of slaw and choice of soda or iced teas.  All for 8 bucks and some change. No too bad!  All that starch and the white meat just a tad dry, bland and just not my thing. Oh and I didn't like that dipping sauce..at all!  I picked at my meal and stared at the disco ball the whole time. I was fascinated by it. I was waiting for the Bee Gees music to start playing and break out and dance. Ha!  The staff was friendly and pretty efficient.    The dining area was pretty spacious although towards the end the line was spilling out the order area and customers in line crammed in aisle by past our table.   You can reach this place off St Rose or if you want to go thru less traffic lights just go on Siena Heights off Eastern and cut through the parking lot.  Just keep in mind that the drive-thru gets backed up and if you are parked in front of the joint you might have a difficult time getting out. Yeah that's how popular this place is! But if this place is so awesome sauce why am I the second to review? Come on Caniacs! I know you are out there!"}
{"text":"my friends were raving bout this place.. it was just ok for me.. the bread was fresh warm and not too sweet.. the chicken.. i admit it's better than kfc.. but we went back 3 times within 2 days!"}
{"text":"My first trip to canes, midweek lunchtime. I am not a big fan of boneless fried chicken but everyone and the reviews here made me stop.  Extremely long wait thru the drive thru. Good sign I guess but it's the only protein on the menu. Sides limited, I ordered cole slaw and three tenders. I must say, delicious. Very hot and crispy. Meat was tender and juicy. Side sauce is slightly spicey but not necessary when chicken tastes this good. My only complaint was the wait and menu choices."}
{"text":"The food here is great and all, but I need healthy options for when I'm dieting, and this place has NONE. Everything they have is breaded, fried, or dripping with saturated fat! It's truly built for fatasses, and people ignorant of their organ's inability to regenerate, but I have heard nothing but ravings from fans, so I thought I'd give it a go.  Ordered the smallest thing: 3 pcs, fries, texas toast, with soda. I was completely stuffed full of carbs by the time I finished. I even won a free chicken strip coupon...and gave it to my sister, who is one of the raving fans.  BFG's is far more superior...bur what do I expect? Cane's a chain. Cane's: give me more options and I'll return, I'm a gemini for christ's sake.  I'm not saying don't try it-variety is the spice of life, and a lot of people LOVE this place like a brother, I'm just not one of them."}
{"text":"I have to say if this place only serves chicken fingers or tenders whatever you would like to call them, they have failed miserably as a business! I just went there for the first time and wow everything was soggy (we had a 5 minute drive back to our hotel) which is just terrible!  The chicken tenders had no flavor, the special sauce is not that special I was hoping it would be a spicy ranch! The fries had such a plain taste to them I didn't want to finish them! The only bright side of the whole thing was the piece of toast, it had GREAT flavor but was also soggy! Beware if you go here!! Customer service was also sub par, charged for a large water (subbed out the soda in my meal water and charged haha) then charged for a large sweet tea and ended up getting a medium!"}
{"text":"Came again and actually really enjoyed it. I'm still not a fan of their Texas toast. But over all not disappointed with their chicken. Also, they cane sauce was actually spicy so it was actually good and didn't taste like pure milky cream."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Food was hot. It was just your average chicken restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been a certified trainer for raising canes(different location), and I have to say this is one of the best locations. I always go through the drive thru, and though they may not always repeat my order, they always make it exactly how I want it. They are very quick to make my complicated, extra crispy, order and I always leave with hot food. (Knock on wood) but I've never been disappointed with the portion sizes or quality of food here, like other Canes locations*cough*asu*cough*. Keep up the great service!!!"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's seems to always hit the spot! I like to come here for a quick bite or get some food to go. I've noticed that it's usually very busy here, but service is always good and fast. In terms of their operations, I think the simplicity of their menu is what keeps everything very consistent and fast paced. So far, I've never received bad service or substandard food. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Cane's is overrated.  There I said it. To me, it seems like every time I mention Cane's, people are like \"Oh my god, I love Cane's!\" Yet every time I go there, I leave feeling \"meh\".  Well here's the truth, it's not that good. Cane's is a great example of an eating establishment that should be getting 4 or even 5 stars but gets downgraded because of its pretentious attitude, overpriced menu and poor-quality side dishes.  Let's start with the positives. The chicken fingers (which are all they really serve) are excellent. Some of the best chicken fingers I've ever had actually. The Texas Toast (gotta capitalize the \"T\" in Texas!) is nice as well. Also, the restaurant is very neat and tidy.  Now, time for me to rant and complain...  The value here isn't really great, and you can get better deals at other fast food restaurants. The only real reason to even consider Cane's is if you really want decent-quality chicken fingers and you don't mind overpaying for them.  The sides leave a lot to be desired. Yeah, the TEXAS Toast (which should be called the Rhode Island toast because it's tinier than your last bar pickup's package) is good, but the cole slaw is bland and boring and the fries are very below average.  The soda machine is a letdown. Yeah, I went there. I swear that is the flattest Sprite I've ever had out of a soda fountain.  But most importantly, Cane's is PRETENTIOUS. They think they're hot coffee because the line wraps around the establishment. But don't be fooled - you will just be waiting longer for disappointment. But everything about this place screams pretentiousness.   Is that why you charge $10 for 6 chicken fingers and low-quality sides?  Is that why you charge extra for essential sauces like honey mustard, while giving away ketchup like you're doing us a freaking favor? Ketchup is for children Cane's, and I'm a big man with a teddy bear!  Is that why you make me show you my ID when I use my credit card? I'm buying freaking chicken fingers, not an alcoholic beverage! Seriously, how distrustful can you be???  And the icing on the cake, is that why you treat your precious little Cane's Sauce like gold? Guess what, the Cane's Sauce ISN'T EVEN THAT GOOD!!!  Look, I want to like Cane's. Their chicken fingers are great. But it's just little nuisance after little nuisance with Cane's. At some point, it's time to stand up to these little nuisances and give the restaurant the rating it really deserves.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Great place to get chicken tenders and a meal. Service was great and enjoyed the eat in."}
{"text":"We stopped here earlier tonight after catching a movie at the nearby AMC Mesa Grand movie theater. I haven't been to a Cane's before, though I do miss Rock N' Roll Chicken Fingers in Tempe.  We ordered a combo to share between the two of us, 6 chicken fingers, texas toast, krinkle fries and cole slaw. The slaw was good, though not as good as say Boston Market or KFC. Ordered a fresh squeezed lemonade, but we both agreed it felt watered down and bland, plus 75% of the cup was ice. The toast was solid in flavor. The fingers were great, especially with their dipping sauce. They are huge like one tender is easily 2. The fries were good, though a bit soggy after having made the trip from there to my home. Will likely check out this chain again, not too bad."}
{"text":"I had never gone to Cane's before last week. Then I liked it so much I went 2 days in a row! The first time I brought a friend and our kids, and day 2 was just my husband and daughter. The staff was very friendly and we got our food very fast. I love all of the movie posters on the walls & the music is good, just a little loud. The sauce! Omg I love the sauce. I've been trying to recreate it, but it's nothing like theirs! I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The service here is really fast and really great. Normally people are rude but here, the cashier is extremely friendly. Our food was cooked perfectly, and it was freshly made. Very satisfying. I got the 3 finger combo and honestly that was a lot. Besides they don't really have anything else on the menu, and you get so filled with that."}
{"text":"Chicken was pretty good as usual. Waited in drive thru 20 min, never again. Why is this place always so slow?  Then the server gives a lecture on charging .41 cents for an additional sauce. She then forgot to give me my drink. The appeal of this place has worn off."}
{"text":"Sad. Went through drive-through wasn't very busy. The person taking the order talked really fast and was not a very patient person when I posed a couple of questions regarding the menu. Paying went fine. I requested wet naps thinking there may be some since a lot of the food as finger food, after being in a and unclean environment it would have been nice to wash my hands a little bit before eating my finger foods that I got through the drive-thru. I didn't realize Sauce cost $0.35 for a small amount of it you must really like your sauce. I want to make it a habit to go back for the price it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Everyone is polite and welcoming. My dog even got a doggy treat in drive thru. Food was really good too, I got the Caniac combo recommended by yelpers here: Chicken fingers, toast, Cole slaw, and a drink. Carb overload, but it's a fatty treat is good once in a while. :)"}
{"text":"Whether you are in the mood or not for some really fresh and juicy chicken strips, Raising Cane's is definitely the way to go.   Their special dipping sauce is MOUTHWATERING. No joke. And their fresh sweet and tangy lemonade quenches your thirst from the chicken strips perfectly! (Side note: do an Arnold Palmer and mix it with their equally tasty sweet tea)  I usually get the 3 tender combo, a perfect amount to satisfy my hunger. Along with the tenders, one of the highlights of the combo is the buttered and toasted to perfection Texas toast.  An even more plus with Raising Cane's is that my favorite R&B singer, Khalid, approves of and frequents this great restaurant when in town!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and they get it out very fast  April was very nice and patient.  Brianna was great friendly happy to help with a smile.   I love the sauce they serve with the chicken.  I'm not a fan of chicken but there's is great."}
{"text":"The one thing that I think will always keep me from rating any Cane's as a 5 star is the smell when you first walk in, it smells like a barn or chicken coop.  This may very well be what they are going for but it always assaults my sense of smell and throws me off a bit.  Other than that, great place to grab chicken, its a fast food place so there isn't anything fancy about it but they do what they do very well.  The \"Caniac Combo\" is a great meal to split with two people: 6 chicken tenders, pile of fries, coleslaw, and texas toast with a beverage.  We usually swap the coleslaw out for extra fries and add a piece of toast on to it for a meal for two under $10.  The dipping sauce is a great blend of spices and sauce.  Didn't realize they were open as late as they are but good to know for the late night cravings."}
{"text":"Learned how to make the special canes sauce from home and it was the best choice I ever made. The lines are always long but the service is always quick! I wish they would open up a location closer to my house. I can't forget to mention how good the Texas toast is."}
{"text":"Great food but just don't ask for a lemonade after 10 o'clock it's super water down but the food is really really good"}
{"text":"Its not often that a fast food restaurant deserves four stars but canes almost deserves five. Good chicken, fries, texas toast with sauce to die (would love to know their secret recipe) all washed down with fresh brewed sweet or unsweet tea for less than $6 per person. All quality ingrediants. Served with a smile in a comfortable and clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"What an incredible place to visit!  From the moment we walked in the door, we received the red carpet treatment.  We were warmly and promptly greeted.  Then, because there was a short line, the counter folks acknowledged us and said they would be right with us.  Ordering was fast and easy.  After a short wait, they brought our order to our table.  Food is excellent given that it is fast food.  I really liked the slaw - it tasted freshly made.  Overall, a great place to eat and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm giving a fast food, chicken strip joint five stars! I feel...I feel...good about it.   I mean, come on, for just a few cents over six bucks you get  This box http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=orF-6gO8zteljlzAFq-Oqg Filled with some of the best fried chicken strips (5 strips) I've ever had http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=4wdej6Xl7xL5BL8w3dsEbA Plus fries and Texas toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=K8h0AZmAa9S5SC93VmpVjQ And Cole slaw and an amazing dipping sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=5OyWMqG6JdeX0AgfE8yNOw And this gigantic sweet tea http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3vxIqhm2jCVjkUWtmDvTsw?select=Vhnh9U2Q_Xh9N8aanZf6Zg  In all honesty, Raising Cane's does serve up some of the best tasting chicken strips I've ever had. And definitely the best I've ever had from a fast food joint. Every strip is fresh and prepared after they're ordered. They're super crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle but the best thing is there is zero grease on these strips. The fries were also nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle. The toast, slaw and sauce were all amazing too. Oh, and their sweet tea is perfect. Not overly sweet. Perfect.   Prices are dirt cheap and service is fast and friendly.   Majors thanks to Dru \"DirtySmoke http://www.dirtysmokebbq.com/\" C. for putting this place on my radar. You're right, Dru, it was amazing.  Check out Raising Cane's for yourself next time you're in Vegas. Trust me, it's worth leaving the strip for."}
{"text":"Well, I'll give this place stars for frying-up-to-order chicken fingers, food came out nice and steaming hot and prices were really cheap!  It was the first time in awhile we've paid under $15 for a complete meal for two! Other than that, food was ehh okay for me.  FYI: So you kind of know where I'm coming from...I really don't eat at any fast food places, some as long since 1998. Only reason why we were here was 1. Mr. B. is a fan of this place and  2. Everything in the proximity of the outlets were all fast food and 3. I'm fasting for Lent and it's was no red meat Friday.  I ordered the smallest combo offered which was 3 chicken fingers, fries and Texas Toast and all I could think was it was super starchy! Lucky Mr. B ordered the larger combo that included coleslaw.  Since he doesn't like coleslaw and I hardly eat bread, I made a trade.  His coleslaw for my Texas Toast! I think it was a good trade! The coleslaw was nice and cold and crunchy..the dressing was a bit runny though.   Since I limit my intake of starches, I skipped eating the fries too.  Not a fan of the crinkle cut type anyway.   Chicken was good though. Good sized and pretty meaty and the batter was perfect golden brown and didn't fall apart when you took a bite.   This place was pretty small  but easily accommodated everyone even though it was pretty busy. Set up: order and pick up your food when it's ready kind of deal. The employees here though brought out the food to the tables when they had time to.  Also one assigned to bus tables so the place was pretty clean. This place is one of the better alternatives for fast food and I would eat here again if I had to."}
{"text":"Decent price for the amount of food; chicken was great; fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"I had been told how amazing the food was, so I think I was slightly disappointed. However, it WAS good, just not life changing...but the thing that set this place apart was the service! I felt like I was in a sit-down restaurant. The cashier was very nice and personable, came to check on us, and it was extremely clean and well-decorated. It did not feel like a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Their sauce is surely their strong points. Their menu is simple and mostly nothing will go wrong. The fries do sometimes get soggy but their bread just melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"I came to Las Vegas and our Uber driver recommended trying Raising Cane's. I didn't understand the hype, since I thought it was just fried chicken. But I gave it a try since we don't have Raising Cane's where I'm from on the East Coast. After just the first bite, I immediately understood why people love this place! The chicken was super moist and I believe they are cooked fresh? Which is great because you know you aren't eating chicken that has been sitting under a heat lamp for however long. And the sauce was AMAZING. I'm not sure how they make their sauce so good. It's definitely unique but seemed super simple and just so good.    The only downside is that I feel like it is a little pricey for what I would consider fast food. But you are paying for what you get and what you get is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I love this location. Been to the Raising Canes in St Louis and I love that no matter which location you go to the quality of the food remains the same, great!"}
{"text":"Very simple menu. It doesn't take long to choose what you want...  the combo options are definitely worth your money because they come in various sizes (chicken finger wise) with French fries, a drink, and cole slaw. Not too expensive and located all over Vegas."}
{"text":"I usually come and get chicken about once or twice a week and in the beginning when I stated going I was the happiest guest but now I'm not! Last few time I have gone in (drive-thru) and I ask for my meal to be Xtra Crispy Crispy and it's not I don't like soggy chicken please make the orders correctly please and thank you"}
{"text":"Just updating...being a huge fan of their food, it's hard to be negative. But it's the service that is so frustrating. They always seem to forget to give something you pay for. Easy to catch when eating inside. But feeling rushed in their - always - insanely long drive-thru line, double checking is delayed at times just to get out of the way. So frustrating! When a customer pays for something, the paid order should be checked to make sure the entire order is set before sending out. Ugh! I'll drive to the Tempe location from now on."}
{"text":"Back in Texas, the BF and I lived right down the street from a Raisin' Cane's- and they inundated the city with their billboards and marketing, and the BF was one of their biggest customers. I finally went one day and didn't get the hype, their special sauce in particular was a tiny portion, and not particularly good either.  Fast forward like a year later. We've moved across the country and yet down the street from another Cane's! Within a week, BF was there, happy again.  But something is different about this location. He brought their food home and I took a little nibble. Which turned into half the order. And then me initiating a visit the following week. What on earth is different, I have no idea. But the chicken strips are moist and flavorful, the sauce is tasty enough to dip just about anything in, and I can mindlessly munch on their fries for far longer than I'd care to admit.  Raising Canes, you've redeemed yourself. I don't know how, but you did. Service also is fairly good here- even in the dead of night, the staff is in a good mood. Though they have a weird habit of insisting on checking for ID even on drive thru orders under $10.  A little odd, and sometimes annoying, but they're on top of their game in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The chicken is crisp but not rip your mouth crunchy.  Perfect. Very small menu. Wish it had more choices.  Plus no pickles.  :("}
{"text":"Some of the best fast food chicken I've had. Good portions and a decent price."}
{"text":"We were looking for a fast food place to eat, so we decided to try this place. We both had box combos. Fried chicken strips, Cole slaw, toast, and French fries. My favorite thing was the toast. It was lightly toasted on the outside and soft on the inside.  My bf's favorite was the chicken and the fries. The chicken was moist and light on the breading. It also wasn't oily.  The fries were crinkle fries. The Cole slaw was fresh (but I am not a huge fan of Cole slaw). The lemonade was good, but the drink I liked best was the sweet tea."}
{"text":"Okay, so I normally LOVE Raising Cane's, and I normally love this chain. But last night, kind of ruined my opinion about it.  I never thought that I would ever write a negative review of this business, because I normally am always pleased with it. But the chicken fingers were bland, and the French fries  didn't really taste that good. My experience wasn't all that, but judging on my pat experiences, I couldn't give it one or two stars. But, sadly disappointed ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite drive thru fried chicken joint. The chicken is always fresh and their special sauce is amazing. Menu is simple since they only keep chicken strips, which makes things easy for customers, but drive through wait can take up to 10-15 minutes during busy schedule."}
{"text":"Good fast food chicken, prices are good and the service is very friendly. The location is very clean from inside, even with many teenagers working there. They only specialize in chicken fingers and special sauce, and its excellent. If you want fried chicken on the go then this is a must try place on rainbow and 215."}
{"text":"It was 10 pm and I decided to have some late night raising canes! (Any time I have a chance to eat some, I definitely will!)  Well I arrived at the drive thru line and there was about 4 cars in front of me. 10 minutes go by and I finally get to order. (the line is terribly moving REALLY SLOW.) Another ten minutes pass, and I finally get to the second window. The girl was friendly, took my card, swiped my car, and told me she would be right with me, and closed the window. It has now been about 25 fricken minutes and yet I still don't have my food. (WTF) As I look inside, I see high school age girls goofing and giggling around. Um hello you are at work! I didn't even get a \"thank you for your patience\" or even an explanation as to why I waited about 30 minutes for food.  So skip this drive thru if you don't have about 40 minutes to spend in the drive thru. I will just stick to the canes in Mesa!"}
{"text":"There is one thing to be said for a limited menu...but this is a chice of three things, which are basically the same except for whether you want cole slaw, a roll or a piece of texas toast which after having lived in Texas was not too Texas.  But $7 for what amounts to a chicken breast worth of meat, Or-Ida fries and a teeny weeny little thing of coleslaw? I am talking your fork barely fits in the slaw holder.  I can spend $7 at alot of other places and get alot better food, including chicken."}
{"text":"Great service and the fingers are delicious. One of my kids' favorite places. The staff at this location always seems friendly and polite. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give Michael the manager at Rock Springs location kudos for taking such good care of my husband and I . We were missing 2 pieces of their delicious chicken and he made it good . So it's nice to know there are people out there that are good people. . If you haven't tried their chicken you are missing out  it's the best thank you again he managers name is Mack not Michael he's the best Just came from raising Cane's once again the best chicken fingers in town and the coleslaw and french fries are great also just was had a girl wait on me by the name of Jessica very sweet girl polite got my order ready for me in a very timely manner even though it was Super Bowl Sunday God bless the people a raisin canes yeah"}
{"text":"Great place for chicken fingers and sweet tea. I always sub the cole slaw with an extra piece of texas toast. Its true, \"the sauce is the boss and the toast is the most.\" Great eats with quick service."}
{"text":"My first time here and I just thought everyone's opinions were just overrated but to my surprise, the chicken fingers are pretty impressive. Soft moist and tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Perfection. I must say the combo deal is great. Everything is fresh; the fries, the chicken fingers and the Texas toast.  The atmosphere was relaxing, the staff extremely friendly, dining area clean and food was good. Very impressed with the personal experience of calling your order by name and walking it out to your table, not your typical fast food but very welcomed. What more can you ask for?! Keep up the great work Cane's"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them MORE than 5 stars!  They do ONE thing.  Chicken. and they do it BRILLIANTLY.  The Texas toast is amazing, I always end up stealing my husband's toast from his order.  When I moved to Vegas from San Diego, I was sad at leaving Chic-Fil-A behind.  No longer does I haz a sad.  ;)  Staff are friendly, cheerful and HELPFUL.  Place is always immaculate, and there's always at least one person in the lobby area busing tables and wiping things down.  Sweet Tea - don't pass it up, it's awesome.  And to the one critical review I see below, may I say that if scads of people are saying it's great, and YOU happen to not agree... well perhaps it's YOUR perception that's off?  You mentioned being there late at night - perhaps your perceptions were \"chemically altered\"?  :)  Anyway - amazing, amazing, and terrific.  Don't miss it!  :D"}
{"text":"One of my favorite chicken strip restaurants. Today my fries were a little soggy but usually they are crispy and delicious."}
{"text":"So between price, quality, quantity i give this place 5 stars. The food is done well and it will not give you a stomach ache after eating eat which i get often from fried chicken. Its a little expensive but it is under $10."}
{"text":"After not being able to order chicken strips at Dairy Queen down the road (because of how incompetent and generally unpleasant their staff was)... We decided to come get chicken fingers here and while going through the drive through, were presented with Angie. She was absolutely delightful, pleasant and actually understood the concept of customer service. There was also another cheerful male employee singing in the kitchen while cleaning when we pulled up to the window. We are glad Dairy Queen failed so hard tonight because it brought us to making a more solid choice with you guys. Thank you for the positive vibes and proper customer care."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last weekend while I stayed at my friend's house nearby.  It is a good \"fast food\" type spot.  Yay: -Sweet tea: theirs is one of the best I've ever had! I like that they sell it by the jug. -Chicken Fingers: moist, crispy, and juicy.  Nothing like a chicken nugget where it's a bunch of mushed up chicken parts.  You can tell it's real chicken. It wasn't oily either which is a huge plus. The combos come with coleslaw, fries, and texas toast. Yum!  Other: -Fries: I love fries but I felt like theirs needs some kind of seasoning. -Cane's sauce: I don't know what it is... I don't know if I like it or not but I think the chicken would have been good with ranch or gravy instead."}
{"text":"Went on 11/12/17 around noon and our service was pretty awful. We waited in the drive thru for about 25 minutes and when we finally were ready to pay the gentleman at the window was not friendly. I had to ask him to repeat my order twice and could not hear him and had a pretty crappy attitude. So, we moved up and waited quite a bit for our food with another gentleman with a crappy attitude. I finally get home and I am missing my extra sauces, toast and fries and both the drinks were Dr. Pepper when that wasn't what I ordered. And I ended up paying for the extra food without getting it. I didn't think about checking the food at the drive thru because they have never messed up my order before. I tried calling the restaurant but the phone just kept ringing so I didn't want to bother much longer. Of course I'll be back, love the food! But the service was sucky and pretty upset about all that missing food I paid for."}
{"text":"I am Not a Fast Food and Chicken Person But Raising Canes's Chicken on Centennial is \"The Only Place\" that I will go for either one.  The Staff there is a great bunch of kids and they really take care of their customers and the seating area is especially clean. Today when we walked in we were greated by Joseph, I found out is a Recent High School Grad and he could not have been nicer to the wife & I.  Everything was Great today and always when we get there on Centennial. KUDO's Canes for hiring Great Kids from High School as they are doing a Great Job & earning their keep too. Sgt Rob Wells Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Been going to Cane's since I lived in Vegas. This place always delivers a solid meal at a reasonable price. It is like the perfect marriage of flavors in each bite with the slaw, bread and fingers. The chicken is even better back at the house heated to a crunchy level and dusted with your choice of spices. Of course, you also always need to buy an extra Cane's sauce, so your not skimping on your dipping. Great sweet tea too!"}
{"text":"Wow! By far the best chicken tender place I have ever had!   When I first walked in the door, all employees within the vicinity greeted me. My cousins had told me that this place was really good, but I wasn't too hyped about it just because I was afraid of disappointment. Nope, this place was so good. The chicken tenders were great in size, not too big and not small. It was crispy and super moist . Yum.Three pieces filled me up with their crispy wavy fries and their super soft Texas toast. Wow. I can't even express how delicious this meal was. Their sauce was the Bomb, and they even had Louisiana hot sauce which made it seem so authentic to me!   The portion was super big, the party of 6 that I came with ordered 3 6 piece chicken tenders with fries and 2 Texas toast. We didn't finish, leaving one piece of chicken tender each and lots of fries.    After being amazed from this place, as I walk out the door the employees all said goodbye. How sweet!    Please bring this to San Jose California!!!!"}
{"text":"Against my better judgement I came back here.  The employees here are what truly make this place a sinkhole of awful with their attitudes.  The food is below average, but if the staff weren't spending all of their time hanging out as if this was their own personal teenage hangout, maybe it would be better... maybe.  Dozens of better places IN THE AREA, and I mean fast food wise.  This was my second and without question the last time I ever come to this place."}
{"text":"Hey this place is usually really good but they've gotten smaller and smaller on fry portions on drive-thru orders.  What's up with that??"}
{"text":"Absolutely heaven!!! These chicken strips are delicious and fresh. This is my favorite fast food place to eat. I have eaten at Chic Filet and I'm just sayin they definitely will give them a run for there money when they come to town. The restaurant only serves chicken strips with this delicious toast and special sauce. Oh don't forgot the Arnold Palmer...Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Find something worth doing and do it with all your might.  Raising Cane's does chicken fingers with the strength of ten men!  That is to say they have figured out how to constantly deliver high quality great tasting chicken fingers.    If you want anything but a chicken finger (or chick finger sandwich) this is not your place."}
{"text":"If your a major chicken fingers fan then this is your spot. In general chicken fingers are not something I look for in a menu but I figured since everyone mentioned this place, I might as well try it. Luckily this one is close to where I live.   Chicken is moist and is probably one of the best chicken fingers I ever had. Usually at other places either the chicken is dry or the skin is too over cooked and ends up being chewy. A  big plus is it offers a generous amount of sides.   Why the 4 stars? I've eaten here at least 5 times the past few months and sometimes the chicken fingers are small. Service in general is good."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed with Cane's. It's not a big menu, pretty simple, chicken strips, the homemade kind. They are crunchy and the chicken is very moist, never had a bad piece yet. Their sauce is good, bread is sometimes a bit soggy from condensation if you take it to go. The service is amazingly friendly and the wait for food is never long, even with a line in a drive thru. Also for the price you can't complain! I usually wait until the dinner rush has passed, but today I went at 7:30 pm and they were still busy, still was a short wait. You have a loyal customer Cane's!"}
{"text":"Pretty dang good fast food chicken.The breading is light and flavorful all fresh from lemonade to Texas toast. I love there signature sauce but not a fan how they charge extra but it's all good in the hood. The service is fast and friendly I feel and I don't mind waiting a little longer for quality over quickness. I still feel chic file has em' beat but Raising Cane's jsut has a different style and more simpliar."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I was really excited. But I think the batch of chicken I got was burned. It tasted like it was either fried in burnt oil or burned itself.   I love their sauce. One of the best original sauces and you can dip your fries, chicken, whatever in it and it will taste amazing.   I did get a chance to try their chicken a second time and it was much better. Unfortunately I was given a bad first impression. Something they are doing super well, and consistently, is their fries. I'm a sucker for crinkle cut fries, but these are crispy and have a similar salty flavor like McDonalds fries but have more of a \"I came from a real potato\" taste.   If you love fried chicken, check this place out."}
{"text":"I had a coupon to buy one box combo and get one free.  The chicken wings and fries are delicious.Crispy! I recommend to try their box combo. It's nice and tasty and sufficient quantity for a meal for one person."}
{"text":"The g/f has been raving about this place to me for months, since this is her favorite fast food joint, she states when she goes home to the south she could eat this for every meal.  When we finally took a trip to vegas first stop is non other than Raising Cane's at this location.  After trying it I can see what the rave is about.    As my g/f puts it, they do one thing and do it right.  Chicken was cooked just right without a greasy after taste and the sauce goes well with the fries and tenders.  Texas toast is tasty and fluffy.  Before leaving vegas we made a pitstop here for lunch for us and then an hour later another pitstop at the Raising Cane's in Vegas' southeast location!"}
{"text":"I would normally never write a review for a fast food chain.   But this place is great!  1. The chicken is great... yummy sauce, good bread... not big on crinkle fries, but still yum.  But what really wowed me....  2. The service! I kinda expect fast food places with dust bunnies in the corners and lazy teenagers.... But not here! Theres someone constantly walking the floor, wiping tables, cleaning windows, throwing straw trash away from the drink station... and the kicker.... If theres no one in the line, the order taker is opening the doors for customers....  This is the way anat business should be run! kudos to you raising canes!"}
{"text":"I LOVE RAISING CANES. Their chicken fingers surpasses any other chicken without a doubt. Their toast is to die for also. My absolute favorite place to eat. Their servers are very friendly also. They deliver the food to your table and clean up the tables very often. You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Honestly how could you not rate In-N-Out a 5/5. The food there is so dank and the fries are so crispy and fresh it makes me cry every single time I take a bite. Dankest pink lemonade on the market and quality employees. There's a reason their motto is \"quality you can taste\""}
{"text":"I rue the day I discovered Canes!! Have lived here 3 hrs and never once had any interest in what this place was, but seeing as the drive thru line is Always wrapped around the building...stopped in. OMG-The best chicken tenders-fast food or otherwise I've ever had-light, crisp, not greasy, so fresh-real chicken! And the crinkle fries-my fav cut of fries-so good!!! Fresh squeezed lemonade too!! The staff is super friendly and helpful-almost like family owned feel. I need to forget this place-could eat these every day!! Bad bad!!  *Tip-don't wait in the drive thru-take time to park and go inside-way faster!!"}
{"text":"Raising canes is my go to place for a quick meal, always hot and fresh. This one is great, since on weekends it is open till 3am, but man, does it get PACKED!"}
{"text":"I dont get the obsession with this place. Its my 3rd time at 3 different location. The chicken is meh. Not bad not great kind of flavorless. The french fries remind me of Ore Rida fries I can make at home. Im not much of a Texas Toast fan but theirs is good but not worth the wait. The price is fair but I have had better."}
{"text":"Love Cane's! The chicken, sauce and sweet tea superb. I just wish they would serve a salad option."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru I've ever been in. And I'm 67. That's a lot of drive thrus! Ridiculous. I finally got out of line."}
{"text":"It was it is and they do it the best there sauce is good and the have Louisiana hot sauce..also the Texas toast and sweet tea are amazing"}
{"text":"I haven't been inside of Canes yet, so I really can't speak to the service. My sister-in-law has brought it over a couples of times, and it is delicious. I love sandwiches and the chicken tender sandwich is alway fried nice and juicy on the inside. The sauce is pretty good. It reminds my of the sauce from some Thai places. If you like sandwiches try the chicken tender sandwich. I'm not sure if that is the official name."}
{"text":"OK, so I am all about every thing Louisiana, and all the times I have been there, never ate at Canes, so now, there is one up the street from where I live ,and I thought perfect, Popeye's to the north, and canes to the south.  I am in heaven, until I arrived at Canes, was completely taken back by the menu, or should I say lack of.  You get chicken tenders , toast and fries, THAT'S IT! OH, YOU CAN HAVE YOUR TENDERS ON A BUN. That's it......really? Expensive too, wow, I will be back again.....NOT!  Popeye's certainly isn't  inexpensive, but 10 times the menu, and lots of special menu items during the year ..... I will be heading north for my southern fast food fix..."}
{"text":"Good fried chicken fingers and a tasty sauce. Clean store even though it was very busy."}
{"text":"I paid $7.33 for this!!!!! Where are the rest of the fries?! And it's all cold! I'm so livid I drove all the way home. They normally have great svc but  the last 3 times the guy at the window had a horrible attitude and it's the same guy! Not friendly at all and that's the whole reason I love this location they are always perky and extra friendly. Worst experience won't be back to this location!"}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner, not like the first time I went there!  Strips where small and dry, worst chicken strips ever!  Albertsons has Better chicken strips"}
{"text":"Best cheat food! We stopped in to enjoy a guilty pleasure. Excellent choice! Had the chicken basket with fries. The fries reminded me of the kind my family made at home when I was a child. Tasty. Food was hot and exactly what I wanted but better than I expected.   Friendly staff. Clean place. Fast."}
{"text":"So good every time!  Drive thru or dine in !  great hot food!"}
{"text":"Visited the drive thru around 3:30 pm and we ordered one caniac combo to share! (Six pieces of chicken, fries, Texas toast, Cole slaw, two canes sauce, and a drink) We waited about 15 minutes to get our food. (There were two cars in front of me) The girl at the window was very nice and so we finally get our food and we happily drive away!  It came time for us to eat and to my disappointment our box consisted of, four pieces of chicken, two canes sauce, fries, and cold slaw. What the heck where's the toast?! Where are the other two pieces of chicken?! Such a pain that they would forget how to count and just miss the toast. We unfortunately did not drive back because we were already far. They didn't forget how to swipe my card though...   Anyways if you visit this drive thru please check your food before driving away!"}
{"text":"I love Chicken so this review might be biased.. I was also slightly hungover when I came here...so my obsession with their lemonade might also be biased..  Chicken strips tasted fresh! Lemonade was delicious! (The perfect amount of sweet and sour).  I didn't really care for their fries though..  Portions are good for its price. I wish they had a spicy flavor for their strips...  Place was clean. Good service. I'd come back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We come here at least once a week. The food is so good. They've really perfected the chicken, and my kids love it too! Lemonade is phenomenal and service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm all about the Sauce and Chicken here!! So tasty, fresh, and hot!! Can't forget about the Texas Toast and the Homemade Lemonade though!! Mmmm. Drool..."}
{"text":"Lunch order to go.   I had the cainiac meal.  It came with 6 pieces of chicken strips, a cole slaw, piece of Texas toast, crinkle cut fries and a drink for about 10 bucks.  The chicken strips were lightly battered with a thin tasty coating.  The chicken tasted like real meat.  The meat itself could have been juicier.  The strips were crisp and weren't greasy at all.  The fries were boring.  Reminded me of elementary cafeteria fries.  I'm not a fan of cole slaw but this one looked more homemade than the kind they serve at other fast food places.    They also included a couple of sauces.  Tasted like thousand islands dressing with a bit of a kick.  Went well on the chicken and fries.  A big portion but also a bit pricey.  One thing I will say is the chicken platters dont make much sense.  It's better to order seperate meals and pay an extra buck for fries and a drink."}
{"text":"Not really a fan of Fried Chicken or Chicken Tenders in general. But I would still say this place is alright. I'm in love with their toast. I order that just by itself. People get pretty hyped over the Cane's sauce but it wasn't all that great to me. Prices average $10 for a meal. The big box meal was too much for me to finish on my own. But my boyfriend was able to finish his and the rest of mine. I literally ate the toast and half of a chicken strip.  Customer service could use some work. The lady working at the drive thru was pretty rude and made it obvious that she just wanted us to leave."}
{"text":"Limited menu and selection, decent fried chicken fingers. Nothing great or something to write home about, overrated.  No family meals or packs, they do offer packs of 25 chicken fingers and on up with no sides. Their sides are just Coleslaw, Fries, More Cane's sauce, and Toast. Their coleslaw is a 2, crinkled cut fries are decent, their toast is just standard texas toast, their Fried Chicken fingers are thick and juicy, but the batter is boring and they don't have anything spicy. Their Cane's sauce is ok, but is tastes like its ranch or mayo and ketchup mixed together. It's a decent place to eat and filling. Their Freshmade lemonade is too sugary and sweet. Overall a 3 out of 5, there are numerous and better fast food chicken places out there. I'll stick with Popeye's spicy fried chicken and mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Due to time limitations, I chose to use the Raising Cane's drive thru. My order was taken accurately and I was met by a smiling face at both windows. Their service was fast, friendly and I have no doubt my food will be delicious."}
{"text":"Canes is a food chain that hardly ever lets me down. I usually order a box if I want to pig out. Caniac's are huge but if your really hungry it's satisfying!   Majority of their food is the same quality which is nice considering other chains can vary. I do not recommend the coleslaw, instead you can get two pieces of toast! :)"}
{"text":"This has been on my check list for some time and I finally got to try it!  Crowded location since its next to the shopping outlets but fast service and clean!  Moist, flavorful chicken fingers that aren't overly battered. Cane's sauce is comparable to Chick-Fil-A sauce but with pepper added.  Texas Toast: Yum! And can you say all you can drink sweet tea?!?  Definitely stop by if your in Vegas."}
{"text":"Lemmmee tell youu... I'm from so cal where we have chick fil-a the home of the chicken sandwich. And ever since I moved to Vegas, I had to search for tender chicken for my fix. Because unfortunately Vegas doesn't and will never have a chick fil-a. Then, I came across raising canes. I can say I've found my tender chicken. It's not exactly a sandwich, although they do have sandwiches.. It's about the tender chicken tenders! And what makes them unique is their sauce, which apparently is the boss. Also they have sweet Texas toast and sweet yummy-tea to top it all off.   This specific location was pretty sweet itself. It was my first time at this location and I was duper craving it. I decided to take drive thru cus I have this thing about going in restaurants by myself (it's not a problem, it's jus personal). Anyway, the wait was a little long. But because of the genuine service I didn't mind the wait at all.   Great service always makes the food taste the way it should.. And I'm always lookin for that service."}
{"text":"Wow super fast drive thru and super friendly drive thru staff!! Didn't give five stars because I wish my sandwich bun would have been warm er =)) for fast food i leave a happy person."}
{"text":"A simple 5 item menu with a few items as add ons, sweet tea, and a peppery cane's sauce that's great with the fingers.   Friendly service, much better than some of the random McDonalds or Carl's Jr. The cashier was really cool and gave great 1 on 1 service. And the food was really good. I'd get my chicken sandwich from here over KFC or Popeyes anyday; and I stopped here because it was near my bank and I had the munchies.   The story behind this place is that for a business class in LSU a professor gave the assignment to create a company that utilized every aspect of business and make a proposal. So two students made up Cane's Chicken Fingers, and the professor shot the idea down and said that it would never work.... guess they proved that guy wrong.  So enjoy raising some chicken fingers to the man for me!"}
{"text":"Listen, there is crack in the batter. My dinner plans for the last three days have consisted of Cane's delicious fried chicken and I ain't even mad. Honestly this is probably the best fried chicken I have EVER HAD in Phoenix and if you don't think so too, you're wrong and I hate you. My boyfriend has been raving on and on and on about Cane's and I thought he was exaggerating... Oh ho ho ho boy was I wrong.   Menu options are basically just a tenders meals in different quantities and a chicken sandwich. Honestly this is great because Cane's is not trying to be something it's not. A meal consists of fried chicken- finger style (duh), three sides (typically toast, fries and slaw) with a side of savory Cane's sauce. The real way to do it: sub that slaw for another piece of toast and add an extra Cane's sauce (that stuff is so good). Staff is super attentive and friendly, usually this place is packed (I stopped by the drive thru and they had a full house on Monday, of all days)."}
{"text":"Yummm! That about sums up my experience at Raising Cane's. Not much more to really say other then this place has really good fried chicken. It's a shame that none have opened up in California yet, but with chicken this good, it's definitely just a matter of time.   However, before I rave about Raising Cane's, I feel that I need to respond to a negative review about the place from a certain Elite '11 member from Henderson, Nevada that yelped how Raising Cane's is \"really expensive\" for chicken fingers and that the 5 star reviews awarded by reviewers were mostly from \"Californians who are deprived of food that doesn't taste like absolutely nothing\". Come again? Those darned double negatives can be so baffling.  In regards to the price, Raising Cane's flagship combo is the \"Box Combo\", which consists of four generously proportioned chicken fingers, French fries, a slice of toast, a side of coleslaw, a side of sauce, and a drink that costs $6.79. Hardly a wallet buster!   Moreover, compared to KFC' similar combo meal, the Variety Big Box Meal, which consists of a drumstick, a chicken strip, popcorn chicken, two small sides, a biscuit, and a drink that costs $5.99, the price difference of $0.80 seems hardly expensive, let alone \"really expensive\". And seriously, this member has probably never been to Chick fil-A where a 4-piece chicken strip meal costs $6.49.   And the audacity to imply that Californians do not know what food tastes like and that California is the land of no seasoning is a gross misstatement. Seriously, apart from the Las Vegas area, the state of Nevada is nothing but a large sandbox with its total population (2.7 million) being less than that of the city of Los Angeles (3.8 million). Additionally, many of the restaurants along the Las Vegas Strip are spin-offs or branches of restaurants that were started by renowned chefs in California. Therefore, I really think the Elite '11 status of this member should be revoked.   Anyways, back to Raising Cane's. The chicken is au natural and is made from premium chicken that isn't frozen. For a fast-food restaurant this is a rarity. It's one thing to say your chicken is 100% chicken, but to also proclaim that your chicken is never frozen is a testament to the freshness and quality of the food being served. As for the breading, the spices infused with the seasoning yelped of Southern flavoring. Trust me, I've been to the South (Alabama, Texas, the Carolinas), and for a fast-food restaurant, this is as close to authentic as you will get for $6.79. I literally enjoyed every bite. In fact as I ate, I ended up taking a huge ass bite of my lower lip. Yet despite my bleeding and swollen lip, I continued to inhale my chicken fingers like a whale pausing only to catch my breath and to dip my chicken into Cane's special ketchup/mayo/pepper/spice sauce.   As for the coleslaw, fries, and Texas toast, they were okay, but I honestly didn't give a shit because the chicken was so \"finger-lipping\" good!  In regards to the drinks, Raising Cane's has your standard fountain drinks. But the real highlight is their sweet tea, which is really sweeeeeeeeeeeeet. While I'm sure it contains buckets of sugar (hence its sweetness), what kind of hypocrite would I be if I were counting calories at a fried-food restaurant?   So, if you too would like to enjoy being a glutton for a day, hop into Raising Cane's to indulge in really good fried chicken... and definitely be sure to wash down all that yummilicious fried goodness with Raising Cane's sweet tea."}
{"text":"Just OK. Nothing too rave about. Chicken fingers were crispy and moist inside but lacked a flavor. Was better with the smoky dipping sauce but still about even with the other fast food places that serve chicken fingers. French fries were crisp but lacked salt. Texas toast was average."}
{"text":"Pretty decent chicken fingers, and adequate fries - although it reeks of generic fast food.  The problem here is they only have two sauces (honey mustard and Cain's mayonaisse-based sauce).  Even if you order a larger meal, they only give you a dap of sauce, then make you pay for additional ones.  So, you'll end up spending $1.50 on sauce after your waaay too expensive meal to begin with.  Customer service is non-existent.  Place is always filthy.  It's just easy to skip."}
{"text":"Raising Canes is a great addition to any city. And Las Vegas is the first time I've seen one.  Maybe it's only in LV?  I dont know.   I used to hate on this place, only because I knew they just served regular ol' chicken fingers.  Until I actually tried it, and I was an idiot for hating on something I never even tried.  Never will I do that again.  The chicken is cooked to perfection, juicy, tender, crispy!  The fries are ok, it doesn't wow me, it just goes good with the fingers, but so does the toast! Buttery goodness.  And you gotta get an extra side of cane sauce, I dip everything in it. And the food too.  An then the sweet tea, oh the sweetie, oh the sweat tea, oh the sweaty... Free refills on them by the way.  It is true what they say; the toast is the most, the sauce is boss, chicken is kickin, the napkins whats hapnin, the straws the laws, the fries got size, and so on and so forth."}
{"text":"The food is amazingly fresh, hot and fast. Love this place when we have a hankering for chicken. Never leave hungry for under $8."}
{"text":"Surprised so many are quick to discount a place that you can get a full meal for $6. Yes your chicken wasn't handed to you by a hipster in a barn that was upgraded with modern lighting and a DJ playing, but for what you pay for, Canes is awesome. If you want fried chicken fingers these have to be some of the best.   To clarify for some of the others, a burger king used to be here and they welcomingly bulldozed down that atrocity to burgers to the ground. And they do have modern lighting, and a disco ball for some reason, if that is what you're into."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and courteous, place is very clean, food is delicious, tea and lemonade machines are always full.... a well oiled machine! I believe I ordered our food from Octavio and he delivered it to the table too. Thank you for the great service!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times   The service is good the staff very friendly. But their food is mediocre at best. I really don't understand why everyone LOVES this place.  I would much rather go somewhere else to satisfy my chicken strip craving."}
{"text":"Good chicken, great bread...awful service! We waited 42 minutes to get our order because they 'forgot' it???"}
{"text":"Make sure to bring your ID if you plan to pay with your card. They were dead when I got there and they rather let a customer go just because i had no ID It's a $7.00 meal! That's ridiculous, if someone's trying to purchase Tailgate I would understand.   What's worse is I was on break with limited time to grab something quick to eat and get back to work. I'll be going to In N Out next time to make sure I actually get to eat on my next break."}
{"text":"The food is awesome but they never give me the diet drinks I ask for.... I'm type 1 diabetic so having a carb free drink is what I always ask for... the last 4 times I've gone there and have asked for diet I don't receive diet which can be pretty frustrating considering I have to know exactly how many carbs I will be taking in so I won't wind up in the hospital."}
{"text":"If this place only served Texas Toast and fries I would be plenty satisfied. The chicken and sauce is bomb! I need to come here more often. It's one of those places that is easy to forget how good it is, so when you do return it is as good as the first time! lol! The bf is more of a fast foodie than I am and warned me that other Canes are not always as good as this one though. Good thing this is the one closest to us!   The only reason I had to knock off a star is because of the service. Although we did get our food in a timely manner, they seemed to be very unhappy. I understand that not everyone can be happy with their job, or may just be having a bad day, but being polite never hurts..."}
{"text":"I eat here way too much. Great chicken fingers and even the smallest combo is still a hearty pile of food. I've had so much Cane's Sauce that it's probably my new blood type."}
{"text":"I love chicken tenders but I have to say these are the best. Love the crinkle fries and the Texas toast that comes with the meal. Reasonable  price for what you get. Fast service and always fresh and hot served."}
{"text":"This is now a staple whenever I come to Vegas. The past 3 times I've gone to Vegas - we hit up raising cane's FIRST - before we even check into the hotels. LOL.  Chicken is delicious. Fries are good, the bread is good, the coleslaw is good. Pretty much everything is good. OH THE SWEET TEA, can't forget about the sweet tea.  Customer service is always neat as well."}
{"text":"Came here last year & was looking forward to coming here again.  Its just so good. The chicken, the bread, the coleslaw, the sweet tea. Its just.. you have to try it.  I wish they had one close to me. COME TO SOCAL please!"}
{"text":"Raising Canes went above and beyond and practically fed our entire hospital staff at St. Rose Dominican Hospital - San Martin Campus this afternoon! Thank you for your generosity & kindness! #HELLOHUMANKINDNESS #SANMARTINHOSPITAL"}
{"text":"I don't think you can ever go wrong when you go to Raising Cane's. Each location I've been to, including this one, has been consistently solid on the quality and flavor of their chicken tenders. Crispy breading, warm/soft chicken meat...I'm drooling just thinking about it. Plus, their deliciously gooey dipping sauce (still have no idea what it is, and I probably don't ever want to know because I can't imagine it being anything other than an artery-clogging mixture of very heavy sauces/dressings) is unlike anything I've had elsewhere.   The fries and texas toast are also very tasty and work well as sides, but nothing beats Cane's chicken tenders.   Not much to be said with regards to service or cleanliness. It's pretty much what you'd expect for any typical fast food restaurant. Then again, you don't come here to have food served in front of you on a silver platter. You come here to pig out and indulge on some of the best comfort food ever known to man."}
{"text":"For only selling chicken fingers this place is as good as it gets! I'm not gonna lie when I first moved out to Vegas I wasn't super impressed and didn't understand the hype, but now after living here for a while, I can honestly say I LOVE them.  They're not too heavily breaded or oily and the sauce is simply delicious! Not to mention their crazy good texas toast! yum! If you've never had it, please go! go! go!  I've heard a lot of people compare it to chick-fil-a, which I still think is kind of weird since chick-fil-a sells things other than chicken fingers, but I guess it's most like the fact they're both chicken places. In any case, Raising Cane's, hands down. :)"}
{"text":"Great chicken juicy crispy yummy. There was a line but it moves quickly. Not much to choose from besides chicken strips or chicken strips on a bun lol. I got the combo meal with 6 strips. I won a free meal on a game piece which was cool. I gave it away to a young man with his friends. His friends ordered food they were supposed to share but they didnt have enough money to order him what he wanted. They were probably early teens. He was so happy. Thanks Canes for giving me something i could pay forward. It was a great weekend during spring training.  Cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by my foodie mates! And today, we finally had the chance to give their offerings a go!   We arrived at the drive through, and they offer, basically, deep fried chicken fingers. 1.09/small battered deep fried chicken finger.  The drive through intercom was muffled and loud. We had to repeat ourselves 4 times to order our food, 2 times to correct out order. We also told the food clerk that it's our first time here.  After we placed our order, we moved forward to pay at the window. The cashier looked as if we were bothering her with something. No greeting, no smile, and was not helpful at all when we asked her (what the order taker did not answer) what comes with the 3 chicken fingers. Our inquiry was, AGAIN, ignored and left unanswered.  After paying, we picked up our orders. We asked, AGAIN, what comes with the 3 chicken fingers. The response we got was \"Thank you, have a nice day!\" We thanked the girl, but we asked the same question, AGAIN: what comes with the 3 chicken fingers. \"Ketchup!\" She said.   5 minutes later, we arrived at the flat. Opened our much anticipated recommended grub! We ordered 6 piece combo meal, 3 piece combo meal, and my 3  pieces of chicken fingers with Ketchup. There was 3 pieces of napkins for all orders, and one of their special sauce in a small container.  Overall, SERVICE was subpar based on our experience going through the drive through. FOOD, were greasy, fries were soggy and not thoroughly cooked, the *only* seasoning we all could taste was salt. Oh, and the bread was plain white bread... Toasted only on one side.  What a let down - pricey, bland, soggy, and most of all, bad bad service!"}
{"text":"Raising Kanes   staff = 5 (the ladies at the front made my day)  chicken tenders = 3.5 (lightly battered, moist meat, needs a more flavor)  texas toast = 4.5 (what can i say, soft, delicious, hit the spot)  fries = 3 (fries are fries)  sweet tea = 2 (tastes like sugar water)  overall, i don't think anything here was to die for, but i wouldn't oppose going here if someone brought it up."}
{"text":"Food isn't that good. Don't know why people love it so much. The customer service is okay but they are quite and don't really talk. My favorite thing is the ice tea wow it's amazing! But other then that it's cool. An upgraded KFC with not  a lot of stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried it when we moved into the area; we were excited to have what looked similar to a Zaxby's nearby.   Unfortunately, it wasn't much to talk about. Everything was basically flavorless or limp. Chicken was dry. The sauces weren't anything to brag about either.  The service was slow and not particularly memorable.   We haven't gone back and probably won't. There are a plethora of other fast and casual food establishments in a half-mile radius."}
{"text":"This place does a fine job at cooking chicken tenders and fries. They even got the Texas toast down to a perfection.  Came in here while trolling around Tempe and decided to give them a shout out. Located very close to ASU and should be a popular spot when you need to catch some bird.  Ordered the biggest thing on the menu called the Caniac Combo. Stopped drinking the dreaded soda pop and went with some dihydrogen monoxide. It is a lot better for you and the price of the combo goes down quite a bit.  The menu here is very simple and they give you a basic no thrills meal. You can always substitute some of the sides if you so desire. The big thing everyone cries about is the top secret sauce. Maybe I missed the boat on this one but it is nothing more than some doctored up mayonnaise.  Food is pretty good and the chicken is very tender. Good chance they are doing that southern trick of marinating it in some seasoned butter milk overnight. That always keeps it juicy and flavorful after frying.  Would like to see some more dipping sauces. Just take some regular Franks hot sauce and add equal parts of brown sugar and simmer it in a pan. Some country fried chicken gravy would be good also. Maybe just offer some jalapenos or something spicy to add a little kick.  Definity gets really busy around lunch time. Saw tons of sweaty blue collar workers (like me) coming in and chowing down on big plates of chicken. Some of them looked like they could have skipped the soda pop as well.  Recommend bringing your own dipping sauce or hot sauce to complete the occasion. Some people just need more options. CLUCK CLUCK A-OK!  3.25 STARS"}
{"text":"One day me n my family just got to Vegas at night, my sister recommended us Raising Cane's fried chicken. They almost closed but we are starving, so we get in there ask them if it's okay to order the meal. They said okay.  That's the first time we eat there, so we take a lil time to decide which is the best way we can share with each other the meal. Since my mom only speak Chinese, we were using Chinese to conversation with my mom. After, we done the order. I saw the staff's face was kinda showing us like he didn't want to server us.   While we are enjoying the meal, there's a strange loud man voice yelled at us \" STUPID ASIAN!\" I'm was really fcking angry at that moment.  I'LL NEVER GO TO RAISING CANE's EVER! THE FOOLISHNESS OF THE STAFFS TOTALLY LOST MY APPETITES!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fast food chain restaurant person but Raising Cane's is amazing!  The chicken tenders are so juicy, the tea is sweet, the Texas toast is pure magic and the fries are delicious!!  Probably not the healthiest meal but it hits the spot and always satisfies.  This location can get busy during lunch time but the line moves pretty quickly!"}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS!! My boyfriend took me here while we were in Vegas, it is a bit off the strip but so worth the drive. I was there for three days and came twice for lunch. Their Texas toast is super addicting, chicken fingers is perfect not to greasy. The staff are funny and friendly. Love this restaurant!! :)"}
{"text":"Totally yummy...just like all of the other reviews say...do not miss it.    YUM!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday. Good portion for the price and sharing. The sauce is delicious. Wish I could eat more fried foods and I would visit more. The staff is excellent and warm. A pleasure to have at a fast food restaurant. We were served at our table and were given a free sample of lemonade....yum."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! It took me a long time to go here because they serve chicken fingers. Now I wish I went a long time ago! Service was excellent. Only wish we were closer to it"}
{"text":"The prices here are fantastic for the amount of food that you get. The chicken is really good as well as everything else that you get with the combo as well.  We will definitely return when we are back in the area."}
{"text":"Great chicken and fabulous service. Very clean and friendly. Priced right. No complaints."}
{"text":"Their chicken is to die for; delicious and moist. So yummy.  I'm not a fan of the toast like everyone else but its ok. Try combining the hot sauce in the canes sauce. Soooo good. :)"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is so popular, they only have chicken strips and a chicken sandwich on the menu and they are nothing special.  I could get chicken strips anywhere.  They don't do anything special to them to make them any better then something I can get in the frozen food isle of the grocery store.  I could see small kids liking this place and that is all there really is to say about the place.  It's not like they even offer different breadings for the chicken strips.  It's all pre-made frozen garbage if you ask me.  If you really like this place, you either like very bland food or are a very picky eater."}
{"text":"On my first trip to Vegas, I knew I had to try Cane's because everyone seemed to love it! (At the time I didn't know there was a closer location to me in OC, but oh well).   My first visit was dine-in, and even on a late Tuesday afternoon it was packed! We were lucky to find a table that was available since it seemed like some little league team was there at the time and took up most of the tables. The place was pretty clean and I saw them sweeping up a lot.  Service was OK. I didn't know anything about the place before ordering so when I asked if they had any BBQ sauce the cashier kinda just laughed at me. I mean OK sorry if that was obvious but, I really didn't know... Besides that she was nice enough, and I didn't have any interaction with the other staff.  The food was also just.. OK. I love chicken tenders and I was really excited to come here because I had heard such good things. The chicken itself was good and juicy, but it really didn't have too much flavor in either the meat or the breading. It kind of felt like I was just eating a good piece of chicken coated in bland panko. Some seasoning would really help the chicken, as well as the fries. I like the crinkle cut just fine, but when I put some seasoning salt on the leftovers myself after we had left, they were 10x better. I can't comment on the coleslaw since I'm not a fan and don't order it. But I can say that the Texas Toast is GREAT. I love the buttery-garlic-y not-too-crunchy outside that hides the soft and fluffy inside. I'd continue going back just for the toast.  Overall, even thought I was pretty underwhelmed, I think this place is OK. I came back on my most recent Vegas trip, because it's cheap for the portion and for its relative proximity to the strip (by car). My opinion on the food is the same, but that may be a good thing since I got it to-go most recently. I wouldn't say I come here to have a great meal (exception being the amazing toast), but it's something decent to hold you over until dinner comes along."}
{"text":"I just had a Cania box combo The chicken was very small but I can see that it was well cooked and it was enjoyed the fries did taste like they've been sitting there for a while but the customer service there is always great"}
{"text":"This location just opened up about a month ago and everything on the drive thru menu has the incorrect prices. I feel like it is very deceiving to see one price and then have the receipt charge thirty  cents more and that's before tax. I've noticed this before on the finger and box combo and the difference between the menu posted and the receipt is even more than thirty cents. It's a shame I'm having to give it 3 stars because their food deserves 5 stars. The drive thru here is also really slow and all the other times I have come the line has been wrapped all around the building taking 20 mins even before you place your order. The line wasn't as bad this time as it has been all the other times I've gone but still it's not \"fast\" food by any means. They should fix the prices they have listed on the menu. The prices are still affordable I just don't like being lied to about them. the sign says the sandwich combo is $5.99 and then the receipt says it's $6.29 before tax and then after tax it's $6.80. I mentioned the price discrepancy with the guy who charged me at the first window on a previous visit and he told me that it's good quality chicken and kind of gave me a look like I can't believe you are complaining about this you cheap mf. He then motioned me to the next window with a sigh of relief to be passing me off to his coworker. He is right about one thing. The chicken is mighty good."}
{"text":"I am disappointed.  I recently moved back to the valley. I was so elared to be able to go to Cane's again. I was excited all day. I couldn't wait to leave work, and run to Cane's! I arrived at the drive thru around 7:30. I spent 25 minutes in the line wrapped around the building, in my truck, and I didn't care. I was sure the moment I got this food everything would be perfect. I ordered a Caniac of course. I was sure I'd be eating all six tender strips.  I arrived home, set down my lemonade, and opened my box to find...six...nuggets. Smaller than 3 normal tenders from Cane's. Seriously, these are clearly from the bottom of the bag or something. I took a picture immediately. I am so disappointed. Unfortunately, that ruined my evening."}
{"text":"Mmm. Dinner here and it's so good. The chicken sandwich with cane sauce. Get here early cuz they are busy."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! They open at 9am. This is great for my husband and I since we work the Graveyard shift and want \"lunch\" food and not \"breakfast\" food :) Love the sayings such as the sauce is kickin etc.. We always get the Caniac which includes 6-7 chicken strips, texas toast, fries, coleslaw and two dipping sauces. One of our cats Pumpkin wont leave us alone until we give him a nibble of the chicken! We will always return"}
{"text":"You can NEVER go wrong with Raising Canes. Ever since I've moved to Vegas from California, Canes had become my go-to spot when I absolutely don't know what I wanna eat. Canes never disappoints. The chicken tenders are made fresh to order and their sweet tea is refreshing. It's crazy cos I was never a fan of chicken tenders until I've tried canes. Something about it.. Maybe the yummy sauce? The batter they use? Idk what it is but it has me hooked! It's also perfect for a late night snack, they're open til 1am! Love it"}
{"text":"SECOND time at Raising Canes and still didn't disappoint! We got our orders to go and this spot is super convenient since we stayed at Tahiti Village and it's also right next to the outdoor outlets. I took my friends here for their first time and they loved it! We just got back to California and they've been craving it again since yesterday! I can't wait until they open one in SoCal! The best moist chicken tenders with da bomb Cane's sauce!!"}
{"text":"My first time trying this place in Vegas and damn this place is BOMB. I'm definitely going to come here the next time I'm in town. If you love chicken fingers and bread, this place is oh so good! So much carbs lol.  Get the BOX COMBO (4 pieces of chicken fingers, crinkle fries, cane sauce, coleslaw, and Texas toast). BUT... DONT GET THE COLESLAW. I didn't like it.. Ask for an extra toast though... The Texas toast is soo good, I can eat it like everyday. The combo also comes with a drink and make sure you try their SWEET TEA! Service was super fast and they bring your meal to you. That's what I likeeee  It's definitely a good place anytime of the day. I'm glad one of my friends introduced this place to me. I wish they had some in California!!"}
{"text":"Love this place everyone is so nice and show great customer service skills. Food is always fresh best chicken fingers in town. Kristina Dollard and Carlos Navarro are outstanding thanks for the excellent service. New location and next to my job I will be eating here often on my lunch breaks."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I love this place! They only make chicken fingers and they are the best I have ever had!! And the dipping sauce?! Extra yum! I always get two! I wish there was one of these local to me- instead I will have to make sure to visit when I am in town.  Unfortunately they are so good it's hard to find parking and seating...but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is definitely quality chicken! KFC and Popeyes does not even compare to how good Raising Cane's is. Customer Service at this location was awesome and they even brought my food to my table! I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with the box combo.  The chicken is always delicious, crispy yet tender.  Great flavor and oh - my - genius their iced tea is the business!"}
{"text":"The Box combo is usually your best deal. Love the dipping sauce and the sweet tea is A+.  FYI they charge 30 cents for extra dipping sauce."}
{"text":"I love the food. NOT this location! The manager is a jerk, some of the employees are friendly other are very rude nd sometimes say very inappropriate things over the speaker in the drive-thru."}
{"text":"I have been to all the locations here in Las Vegas nd this one by far is the best one. Idk how or what they do to their food here but it's better."}
{"text":"WHO DOESN'T LOVE CHICKEN STRIPS??? Their chicken strips were off the hook, fries were just okay, but their sauce & toast were SO FREAKIN AWESOME. It was my first time at Raising Cane's during a fun weekend in Vegas, and it will definitely be my routine place to dine during my future visits."}
{"text":"I love coming in town, but I love raising canes more.. I see that they are putting a few in Cali, they need to put one in the inland empire.. Hell you can put one right by my house neighbors it is..   Thank for the fresh hot food, and the excellent lemonade!!   I couldn't take any pictures because I was too hungry!"}
{"text":"Lila Lila Lila... she's amazing helped a lot when who ever to r order from the drive thru! She made sure r order was made right and fresh! Thanks Lila"}
{"text":"I like this place. Will I go out of my way to eat here? No. The chicken fingers are good but I prefer mine a little crispier ( more breading maybe?) The sauce is good but I prefer a little variety. Ranch or honey mustard would be good options  the bread is great. For me I prefer going to my near bye DQ- which is awesome ! Getting more food (they include a drink and a sundae for 5.00 ). It's good. Not great."}
{"text":"Best chicken strips I've ever had!  The sauce, fries, and chicken strips were very tasty and addicting.  If food was an addicting crack, the chicken strips and fries here are it and you can call me a chicken strip crackhead!   For some unknown reasons, I had such a bad craving for the food here that I came back 3 times during my one week vegas stay.  The price was reasonable and service was quick too.  ps. us Californians aren't deprived of anything...you're just a fat food hater."}
{"text":"We love Raising Cane's! They really make some delicious chicken strips! Good quality, tasty and juicy yet not greasy. The canes sauce is really good dipping sauce. We like the french fries and love the toast. We always order extra toast. And the sweet tea is a must. So good!!"}
{"text":"Try this joint the first time after a recommendation from Lil B and my taste buds were amazed. I had the 3 fingers includes chicken strips, fries and Texas toast omg unbelievable the special sauce is impeccable. The lemonade was delightful hand squeezed however only negative is the container the special sauce comes is too small. Other than that I will be making a visit on the way back to California."}
{"text":"This location is located way on the south-end of Las Vegas Blvd. We stayed at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and it took us 3+ miles to get there. I know..I know...3+ miles is not that far but it just seemed that way. Anyway, this was our first time eating at any Raising Canes though we have one near home. They apparently specialize in chicken fingers only. We are not fans of chicken fingers but our youngest daughter is. It tasted like real chicken.  It's tender, a little bit dry but flavorful. So, the final vote was a thumbs-up on the flavor. Prices were pretty decent, too."}
{"text":"I'll be honest. I like my chicken to taste dead... Meaning dry! This is a juicy chicken that many would rave about. Fair warning: there's no real vegetarian meal options here!"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing, probably the best chicken tenders I've ever had. The service was fast within 5 minutes of ordering my food was out! The food was very affordable too, especially for what you get. If you are looking for chicken tenders in Las Vegas this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"This Canes is the best location in the whole city! The drive thru moves really fast, the workers are nice, and the chicken is the best quality! If you feel like canes, it is worth the drive up there because it is the best Canes in town."}
{"text":"At this location the customer service is alright. Also, the chicken is still hot and fresh. They keep it mostly clean but some tables aren't but it is still ok."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because it's extremely loud inside. The music is loud and so everyone has to be screaming for anyone to hear you. Also the tables and booths can be a little cleaner, someone should be constantly cleaning them up. But the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Great food.  This location absolutely has some of the best customer service.  Visited this location around noon today and was blown away with the service."}
{"text":"I just had late dinner ! Drive tru an hour ago here! Very bad customer service given! I think it was the assistant manager she was rude and she had no name tag ! I drove back at 11:45pm to get a refill on my drink! And she didnt wana do it! She cane with lame excuses about codes and that they cant refill! There was still 15mins before close! She was outside standing by the door! When i spoke to her she was yelling at me! Had very bad tone of voice! I asked her why are you yelling at me\"? She didnt reply , and went in and closed door!  I will never go back there and I'll definitely pass this message along to other people"}
{"text":"Its pretty good juicy fried fattening chicken and their frys are good too.  I even like their sauce but I know there is sugar in it and it will make my ass fat.  Just two chicken fingers with one sauce is very filling.  If you are really hungry 3 is more than enough.  Worth trying.  My only reservations is that I know these chickens are given added hormones, fried, and too much sugar used but tastes great.  If they got healthy with it I would give them more stars."}
{"text":"This place came very highly recommended from several people.  My husband works in the area and was anxiously awaiting it's grand opening.  He found out the history of the place and the owner, and so we decided it was a place we'd go.  We finally made it there yesterday.  The place was clean and the people were friendly.    The menu is small, but I like that.  Too many options overwhelm me.  Hubby and I both ordered the meal that came with 4 chicken strips, fries, toast and coleslaw.  Our kids got the kids meal.    We paid nearly $28. This is more than I had expected, and more than I'd care to pay in the future.  For fast food, this is outrageous.    The chicken was good.  Not too flavorful, but the breading was perfect, not too much.  The fries were soggy and under done.  I could do better at home in my home fryer.  The toast was, well, toast.  Nothing special there.  And the coleslaw was same as store bought, I'd had better.  The \"famed\" Cane Sauce was ok.  It didn't blow my mind and it wasn't gross.  Ketchup was available, which was good since my kids thought the Cane sauce was \"weird\".  Ranch would have been more their taste.  We may go back if there is a location that pops up closer to where we live, and if we were kid-less for the meal.  It's too expensive otherwise."}
{"text":"Went here and my order was wrong the night manager Mike murin was very rude said he was tired of me and I could talk to the general manager and basically told me I was a liar never going there again except to get my money back this was a horrific experience !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great for juicy, large chicken fingers.  The Texas Toast is the best.  I wish the fries were a little bit better seasoned, but the sauce that they give you goes perfectly with the meal!  Sometimes they are busy and sometimes they aren't.  I want to try their lemonade next time I go.  I wish they opened up more locations...  UPDATE:  Their lemonade is nothing to write home about and isn't good enough for the upcharge, they get busy, and you may not get seating, but the food is still great...They are building a location at Maryland and Flamingo in front of Target..."}
{"text":"My family always would tease that if we went to a five-star restaurant, I would order chicken fingers.  And I'll admit- that was true for a number (18) of years.  I have always loved chicken fingers.  I would order them at a bowling alley, a steakhouse, a burger joint, etc. Because I was addicted.  Since then, my palate has grown and I enjoy steaks at steakhouses, burgers at burger joints and beers at bowling alleys.  However, when Raising Cane's came to Las Vegas, my excitement went full-blown and I could not WAIT to try these chicken fingers!  (Did the power's above finally hear me and create a place that would be my heaven?!?!)  With my first experience I wasn't sold on the sauce.  I like honey mustard with my chicken fingers and there being only one sauce confused me.  But I LOVED the flavor of the fingers, LOVED the crinkle-cut fries (seriously, those are the best fries!), the bread was delicious, coleslaw was good and they had Dr. Pepper!  Fast forward a few months and I gave the sauce another shot and have never looked back.  Sometimes the wait might be a tad long, but when they are fresh and cooked to order, the wait isn't so bad.  The company itself seems pretty awesome, as I always hear the owner's on the radio promoting local schools and even UNLV.  Speaking of UNLV Men's Basketball (GO REBS!), if the Rebel's win,  bring in your ticket within 24 hours of the game and get a FREE Rebel's combo.  The Rebel's combo is pretty much a children's meal: 2 chicken fingers, sauce and fries.  For Free, that is very good!  Thank you Raising Cane's for sharing my one love (besides my husband): chicken fingers!"}
{"text":"If your not familiar with Canes the concept is simple- some great chicken fingers.  What makes it so great?  Aside from the delicious taste which is crunch and not greasy, Canes has their \"Canes Sauce\" which is the perfect dipping choice.  If you want some sides there is the Texas toast, coleslaw and fries   It's fast food that is delicious at an affordable price."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero I would. Came in and got a Box to go. Chicken was not only cold it was a little under cooked as well. Fries were completely cold. The Cole slaw was disgusting. The only thing that was decent was the bread."}
{"text":"Chicken is good.  Sauce is awesome.  Locations in Tucson suck.  You need another one on the Northwest side.  I hate Chik-Fil-A."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place, the sauce for the chicken is dynamite. However, after a long day we stopped by Raising Cane's for dinner. We went home only to realize that half our food didn't make it in the bag. Unfortunately only my kids are Cane's that night and the adults had cereal."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good and price wasn't too bad I just wished I ordered more cause it was not greasy not really breaded. Enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Totally agree with another review - soggy, limp, tasteless fries.  Chicken strips were okay.  Juicy white meat chicken but soggy and not enough batter for crunch.  I've had better.  Don't know what the hype is."}
{"text":"pretty good food with generous portions!! Sweet tea is great and overall experience is great!"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is a yummy choice for chicken tenders and fries. Their dipping sauce is delicious. And, as a bonus, you get a piece of toast and/or cole slaw (depending which size meal you opt for). Personally, I always get the 3 finger combo (3 pieces of chicken, fries, and toast) as it is more than big enough to more than fill me up. It's a little pricier than I would have expected, but it's reasonable for the quality and quantity. The staff are pleasant and speedy at this location. The drive-thru is usually always a breeze. All in all, a good fast food spot for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Drive thru line is usually long and takes a bit. The inside isn't much faster. Food is good."}
{"text":"Food is 5 stars forsure. Always comes out hot. I think only once did I have cold fries. BUT this drive thru line is just terrible during the rush. It can literally cause an angry traffic jam in the entire parking complex disturbing surrounding restaurants!  They need to think of a better system to help beat the rush cause I waited in the drive thru for about 20 minutes one time. Oh and my yorkie loves the fact that he gets a large milk bone in the drive thru.  I do enjoy that the food is burning hot, so it's kinda worth that wait. Love the sauce, I always get extra. But my goodness.... this is not a healthy place to eat. I try limit the amount I come here. Pretty sure the food goes straight to your thighs! The staff is always friendly.  Oh and this place has the awesome chunky small ball ice that I love."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant. Nice and clean. Great customer service. Great chicken strips. Will be back again when in Nevada"}
{"text":"Chicken tenders/fingers lack seasoning.  A little too much grease for my taste.  Fries are average."}
{"text":"Hands down, best chicken fingers ever.  Seriously...these are not your average chicken fingers with processed meat and fake flavors. These are real chicken breasts fried, and they taste just like fried chicken.  This place doesn't offer much else - you can gets meals that come with coleslaw, french fries and texas toast...but for me, the chicken was the star. I didn't eat the rest of the sides.  Oh yes, they have sweet tea. And very clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"AWESOME customer service from the manager, Tyler! We were on the east side of town to bring some family members a meal after the birth of their baby. I called to order food for a total of 10 people (the 50 piece tailgate and a tray of fries), was given the prices by an employee and then immediately transferred to a manager. In the few minutes that I waited, my husband and I agreed that we really needed to find a more affordable option for the amount of people we had to feed. Not expecting anything but a brisk dismissal, I regretfully relayed this to the manager with my apologies for wasting her time. That's when she surprised me by not even hesitating to offer me a better deal that would still feed our whole crowd for a price that we could afford. She said that they would still like to have our business and get us the meal that we wanted. I was floored. You just don't get that kind of service at big chains and yet we continually experience great service from this company no matter what side of town we're on! Needless to say, our family had very happy tummies that night."}
{"text":"OK now my family loves Raising Cane's. This location is one of the best. Saturday night I stopped to get a jug of their wonderful unsweet tea. When I got home I realized it's the sweet tea. My son is a type one diabetic and that really spikes his blood sugar. I wasn't able to go back till Monday morning. When I went in to see if I could exchange it they were so wonderful and understood that my diabetic son couldn't drink the sweet tea. They took care of me. The customer service here is truly outstanding."}
{"text":"The best fast food you can find. Delicious made fresh. The staff there are kind, courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Sauce is bomb..toast is good but wayyyyyy to skimpy on the french fries.. That's all I can get from Cane's since I don't eat meat and I am charged $3 and some change for barely a half a cup of fries.. That's a no no."}
{"text":"I have to admit I wasn't that thrilled at the idea of going to a place for chicken fingers and fries, but.... I think I see what the fuss is about! The strips were plump and delicious and the sides were great too. My firends didn't want the cole slaw, but I thought it was very good and yes, the sauce is excellent. Just don't make the mistake of taking it home like some of us did because of course you need to eat this kind of stuff fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Ordered a 6 piece meal on my way home to southern Phoenix. Got home to find I had been given a 3 piece meal. Called wanting to be reimbursed the difference. Only thing they would do was comp a meal, but only at their location (presumably by having to awkwardly re-explain the scenario next time I'm there), which will likely be never as it is like a 30-45 minute drive from my house and I'm rarely in that part of town. And to top it off the food I did get was super soggy and stale tasting. Really annoying, terrible experience."}
{"text":"Canes customer service is outstanding! All their employees are super friendly and outgoing! Even though they are always busy they keep their customer service #1 and food is always fresh! I live in CA and I def always try to stop by when I can because its delish!!! Their raising canes sauce is so good! I always order extra!!! Stopping at Canes is a must!!!"}
{"text":"They got chicken, Juicy and tender chicken with a great sauce for dipping! The Texas toast is really good too. Fries are nothing to rave about but they are good. Glad there is finally one in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Two Caniac combos feed four of us. 6 fried chicken tenders, Texas Toast, crinkle cut fries, Cole slaw and two sauces, fountain drink or 1 lemonade. I was craving their special Cane's sauce. It is creamy with a kick of pepper. I really love their crunchy on the outside, soft of the inside Texas Toast. The chicken is crispy and juicy. Fries are amazing with the sauce. We went through the drive-through and was served quickly through the line. Not a fan of Cole slaw, I asked for extra fries. I love their Cane's freshly squeezed lemonade. Tip: Refills are not free. I get it with light ice. Our meal came up to less than $20. My allotment did not make it home. Tip: Sign up for their Caniac card."}
{"text":"Great dipping sauce and customer service. Cane's is one of my family's favorite spots to get a quick bite. The chicken is always juicy and hot. We enjoy the lemonade, although the refills are not free, it is tasty. We usually ask them to give us more fries and give up our Cole slaw. We like the Texas Toast. The Caniac can easily be shared between 2 people. The dining area is always clean. They have a Caniac Club card that rewards you each time you visit. They give you a free meal on your birthday. Don't forget to sign up. The servers are always friendly."}
{"text":"BEST CHICKEN FINGERS IN VEGAS! I went here for lunch with my old friends and they make the best secret cane sauce. I got the Caniac it comes with a bunch of Chicken fingers fries and even toast! but the best thing you should get at canes is their SWEET TEA! if you want a quick chicken fix! please head to canes! price is great and the atmosphere is clean and friendly"}
{"text":"Dipping Sauce Recipe   1/2 Cup Of Mayonnaise  1/4 Cup Of Ketchup  1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt  1/4 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce  1/2 teaspoon of black pepper/ to taste"}
{"text":"One of the best chicken places I've tried. The sauce is a bit peppery for our taste but In general we didn't feel heavy after the meal."}
{"text":"This company and this location are the best. I go here at least once a week for lunch since I work nearby. They are always fast and the food is always fresh. Today I accidentally forgot my wallet at work and Jeff the ASM told me it was on them today. WOW. You would never ever find a fast food place that would do this. This level of customer service is WAY beyond any other place. This is the kind of company that I want to support and I want to see succeed. Jeff- you just made a customer for life. Thank you."}
{"text":"Where to begin...I've been to the drive-thru four times. Each of those times, I was shorted one or more pieces of chicken. During my most recent visit, I informed the person at the window that I was missing one piece of chicken. She sarcastically remarked, \"Oh no, one piece of chicken?\" That pissed me off so badly that I felt like showing her the longest finger on my left hand. Knowing that cooler heads prevail, I refrained from the popular symbolic expression. After all, how could I possibly be upset at someone who cannot count to six? Next time, I will show her how to incorporate the fingers on her other hand. She will be so happy to learn how to count to ten."}
{"text":"I decided to finally try this place and I have to say it was ok, nothing special.   Chicken strips: The chicken was juicy, the size was good and I liked the batter.  The dipping sauce is good, it was tangy and well flavored. Cole Slaw: Very small portion, about 3 teaspoons, and it was lacking flavor. French Fries: normal crinkle cut fries, just average. Toast: The Texas toast was good, not too bad. Customer Service: Very friendly and outgoing  With a very limited menu and a lack of flavorings for the chicken, I don't know that I would eat here very often.  I heard good things about this place but I'm not impressed.  With a rather dull and boring menu, I might eat here next year!"}
{"text":"Check your order before you leave the drive thru or you might just be coming right back. They have trouble counting here. They are \"special\" and it is a challenge for them so please help them out and check your order. Also be careful of dripping soda they have trouble getting it all in the cup and don't care to wipe it off. They are too busy playing with each other. The manager appears to be the only competent employee in the building. Go to Chic-Fil-A down the street for a better experience and better chicken."}
{"text":"Nothing special- i had better  fries- plain/bland -nothing special special sauce- had better toast-so- so  sweet tea- very good (only thing worth while on the menu) chicken fingers- two words \"child please\" (nasty)  cashier- no comment I will not be returning  sn- good thing Chick -Fil -A isn't in town, because you would be put out of business"}
{"text":"Decent chicken fingers, decent fries, good toast, good sauce, and good cole slaw. Nothing particularly spectacular, and IMO a nearby rival chicken fingers place has more flavorful chicken and better fries. Still, the location itself is bright, clean, and friendly."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. It's very affordable for a large family as well as the portions are fulfilling for all of us. The food is always fresh and taste delicious. I love how you can substitute the coleslaw for extra toast if you want the box combo but aren't a fan of coleslaw like my family. The staff is extremely friendly here and always has a huge smile. They always have gotten our order right including the substitutes and extra sauces. All around this place is great."}
{"text":"Have been going to this location for years. This location is the best Cane's I've been to. Probably because they're always so busy so there is always fresh chicken, bread, and fries! On any given night the line may look long but it goes quick and is worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm normally not a chicken fingers type of guy, but Raising Cane's isn't your normal chicken finger. Here, they're always cooked perfectly (I hate when chicken fingers are overcooked and hard as a rock), their Cane's sauce is delicious (though I wish they had ranch), and they have crinkle fries (I love crinkle fries!)! They also have some decent sweet tea. Their Texas toast isn't anything to write home about. All avid chicken finger lovers need to give this place a go. I live in Socal, so in the past, I used to make it a point to try to stop by Cane's before heading home. Luckily for me, they opened up some spots much closer to home."}
{"text":"I love Cane's. This is a brand spankin new location that just opened up on Tropicana and Valley View. I always get the box combo, it comes with 4 fingers, crinkle cut fries, Texas toast, slaw, and a drink. I always get the sweet tea, it is delicious. I personally don't like their coleslaw, so I sub the slaw for extra fries. Or you could sub for extra toast. Or get no toast extra slaw, or no fries extra slaw. You get the idea.   So normally when you think chicken fingers you think of dipping them in ranch, right? Well I do, but Cane's doesn't serve ranch! At first I was disappointed. A chicken finger without ranch is like a girl without high heels, or something like that. But they make up for that with their Cane's sauce, AKA crack sauce. That stuff is addicting. It's like a peppery ketchup but I think it's made with mayo. The box combo comes with 2 sauces but I always get more. They also have honey mustard sauce as well if you're into that."}
{"text":"Great service, very clean location. Good food at a decent price."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh. Came out hot  .The  chicken fingers were not  greasy   French crinkle fries were tasty  the Cole slaw was fresh and  not mushy I will be back"}
{"text":"If you're a fast good restaurant and the only thing you serve is chicken finger, it better be the best damn chicken fingers ever! That is exactly what Raising Caneis... Damn good chicken fingers! So good big chain fast food restaurants shouldn't even offer chicken fingers if a Canes is in town, why go any where else?"}
{"text":"My teenage sister raves about this place and thinks it's worth the drive from Ahwatukee, so I thought I'd give it a try. In short, they're a lot like the In-N-Out for chicken fingers, except more expensive.   There are three main combinations to choose from - you can have either a three, four, or six-piece chicken fingers box, and each comes with crinkle fries, toast, coleslaw, and a drink (ranging from $7-$9). You better like chicken fingers if you come here, because that's the only choice in chicken that you can choose from.   The food itself was tasty. Nothing too special, but it definitely fills you up. The Cane's Sauce didn't taste much different from Thousand Island dressing, but after doing some Googling, it looks like they make it themselves with just a few super simple ingredients. The chicken also tasted really fresh, and the toast was delicious.  Overall, the place is okay, but I wouldn't travel out of my way to come here. If you're wanting some tasty chicken on a Sunday when another major chicken chain is closed, you'll probably enjoy this place."}
{"text":"The best chicken strips + chicken strip sandwiches! Everything was hot and fresh and we went to eat at like 11pm! I was amazed! Must try if you are in Las Vegas! It's off the strip but worth the drive!"}
{"text":"The sauce is boss. It's like a peppery ketchup and it's pretty tasty. Cane's serves chicken fingers and chicken fingers ONLY, so if you don't like chicken, don't come! I usually get the box combo, it comes with 4 chicken strips, fries, coleslaw and texas toast. I don't really care for the slaw, so I substitute for extra fries. Cane's will let you sub anything you don't like for anything else that you do like so its a win-win for everyone! One thing to note is they do NOT have ranch for a dipping sauce so don't bother asking. They do however have honey mustard, ketchup and of course cane's sauce. Also they have super good sweet tea to wash it all down."}
{"text":"I love canes for quick fast meal. They're service is great and so is the sweet tea. I'm also very obsessed with their sauce! Would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Looks like everyone is dumping loads of hot goo into their pants and onto each others faces again about a place that is mediocre at best, and a disappointment in general.  One of my staple items at any restaurant is chicken fingers. They are easy to eat, they are fucking delicious, it's hard to fuck them up, they have a load of protein, and they are a vessel to get sauce in and around your gag reflex.  Which leads me to the problem with this dump: THEY HAVE ONE SHIT SAUCE.  The sauce is not spicy, it's not ranchy, it's nothing you want in your mouth.  It might just be some salad dressing.  The texas toast, again has no real taste.  Chicken = ALSO Bland.  I've had bowling alley chicken fingers that are better than this.  Who the fuck has crinkle cut fries Cane WHO.  Crinkle cut fries? FUCK OUT MY FACE.  I'm never going here again. Go literally anywhere else and you'll get better chicken. I resorted to using leftover McNugget Buffalo sauce that I thankfully had in my fridge, or I would have had a rough night.  I did eat all of it, dissapointed, but hey I had to eat. So 2 stars for being better than something I would throw away immediately. GOOD JOB."}
{"text":"Update: So I came here after the manager reached out to me to personally apologize for the customer service I received. I came here for an early dinner with my boyfriend after spending the day at the strip. This location is the closest to my house and the strip and my craving was unreal so we decided to satisfy my hunger.  We are inside and the staff we super friendly, attentive, and fast. The food came out fresh and hot and it was my first time ordering the lemonade and it was so tasty and refreshing. Overall I have no complaints except for I wish they opened more locations; especially one down the street from my house   --------------  Let me start off by saying I am a loyal Raising Canes fan. I literally eat this during every lunch break since I've discovered it (I am not from LV and never heard of Raising Canes)  If I were to rate the food it would be 5/5 no doubt, this is my favorite fast food joint.  However, when visiting this East Flamingo location I was very disappointed and left upset by the rude \"customer service\" I had in the drive thru. I always go to the one near my workplace on St Rose and they treat their guest excellently. Well during my drive thru visit the lady helping us out had us repeat our order several times and then when we corrected her she would say \"that's what I said\" when she didn't... When we asked to substitute something she said \"no you can't do it\" in a snarky tone.. might I add that I've done it before at the other location. Then at the window she just came across as snobby and not wanting to assist us.  Never going back to this location."}
{"text":"Finally!!!! A canes chain near my commute. I'm a total sucker for fried chicken strips, fries and toast... Wait the coleslaw and their sauce( simple but damn good ). I'm pretty sure this location is less than 6 months old, but business is booming, food is Fresh and the staff is friendly & the bathrooms are PRISTINE ! I highlight the bathrooms because if you've ever traveled on Tropicana near the 95, you always see the filth in that area. Hookers walking every hour of the day, too many Budget Suites, hooker and pimp motels and of course the magnificent Wild West Casino across the street from canes .    You go Raising Canes, you go!"}
{"text":"Great staff an management was treated wonderfully as soon as we entered the door. To my suprise credit machine was down an I didn't have cash on me an they took care of my kids an I meal. Thank you for the meal an warm welcoming after I had such a long day at work. You are the real MVP's"}
{"text":"Vegan friendly they got coleslaw on deck lmao!! Workers are turnt felt like edc when I walked in. They were playing some jack u when I walked in. Ambiance, well if you a crip don't be walking in here place is painted red. Other than that gotta have my chicken yo"}
{"text":"Apparently they are doing a pre grand opening event by invitation only... My response is WTF WHAT KIND OF FAST FOOD JOINT DOES THAT???!!! we were turned away at the door. They just lost customers, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's has a simple menu, but what they do they do well-fried chicken fingers, crinkle cut fries, iced tea, lemonade, and their delicious canes sauce.  The chicken fingers are great to order in a large quantity for football games or other gatherings. You can call ahead to place your order and then pick it up through the drive-through which is super convenient.  Extra Cane sauce is $0.29 each, but it's worth it if you like extra sauce with your chicken strips or french fries."}
{"text":"Great lunch choice for those that love chicken (which I totally do). Their signature combos come with fries and a drink and is therefore a super great value! This particular location is near UNLV so it does tend to be very busy at the lunch rush but I have never waited longer than five minutes for food. The toast (Texas toast?) that comes with the meals is absolutely delicious. Would come just for that! Definitely try their house sauce as well."}
{"text":"Love coming to this Cane's, as it's the closest to central Strip. It sucks that in Cali the closest Cane's we have is in Costa Mesa, in the middle of nowhere (LA is far from there lol) I usually get the Caniac Combo. You will NEVER go wrong with that combo and a large freshly made lemonade with a slice of lemon added in! The sauce of theirs, it's something else! It gets me all the time, and you can't help but love how it combines well with the chicken and the fries. That bread is delectful and always well done. Always double up on it, as I love the taste as it hits my taste buds. We need some Canes in Los Angeles proper. Make it happen folks!!!"}
{"text":"All they have here is chicken fingers. That being said, they are pretty good. They are nice and tender. I was not a big fan of the Cane's sauce. To me it tasted like one of the Hamburger Helper sauces. The Texas toast was very tasty as well.  I got the Cane's box combo meal which is 3 fingers,fries,a piece of toast, a cup of coleslaw, and a drink. It will run you just over $8. Like I said before pretty tasty overall, as it should be if you specialize in only one type of food. I would recommend it to others. I will go back myselfs as well."}
{"text":"The chicken is on point. Better that chic Gil a.  Chic fil a sauce is better though.  Garlic bread was amazing.  Price is good too.  Cole slaw was extremely generic."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say, all they serve is chicken fingers and it's great. Love their toast and fries too.  Only thing that I'm not excited about is the Cole slaw  Cheap, good food, nice service, and easy parking. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, glad they opened up because all there locations were far from me. The staff is friendly and fun. Cant go wrong with anything i order here, everything is delicious!  Its a nice open place so there is plenty of seating. This is the best canes in town i think (:"}
{"text":"I am literally obsessed with chicken fingers, and therefore I am obsessed with this place. Not sure if I've ever seen anywhere else with a focus on chicken fingers. Not only is it unique in that sense, but their quality is great at such a cheap price! Under $10 you can get a meal with chicken fingers, a drink, fries, Texas toast, and coleslaw. If there's a side that you don't like you can just substitute it for something else. I usually dip my chicken fingers into ranch but they somehow managed to make a sauce perfect for their food. My only complaint is that they don't have a location in California!"}
{"text":"Overall: 1. good amount and style of fries 2. chicken breaded and fried well, was hot and hadnt been sitting out. not too much grease either 3. lemonade was good on flavor and amount of sugar, but was a bad water/lemon juice ratio, too watered down 4. the bread they give you is strange but good, a bit too yeasty though and not toasted enough, even by my standards 5. the sauce was good, definitly need to give ~50% more for the perfect amount for a 4 piece meal, the sauce tastes a bit like sweet black pepper and ranch, i like black pepper and so it was nice with the fries and chicken, i could see someone who hates pepper not liking it tho 6. their iced tea was just like regular lipton but a bit stronger, meh/10 but would please most customers 7. coleslaw is shit and i hate it so maybe it was good but i just dont like coleslaw 8. the service was good, in between a sit down dining and straight up fast food, they bring your food by name and clear it for you, very nice touch. the manager seemed nice but that varies per store 9. quick and fresh 8. strange music and asthetic, disco ball + lights were a nice touch 10. good prices. 11. i didnt use the bathroom but i should have to rate that too.   damn i should put this on yelp or google reviews fuck 4/5 overall tbh"}
{"text":"The chicken is so tender and full of flavor. The price is not that diff from MCD but the quality is much better."}
{"text":"When we arrived, they were very busy, but we didnt wait in line very long to order our food... about ten minutes later,  they brought our order out to our table.  The chicken was juicy and the french fries were crispy and hot... the fried bread, which comes with your meal..was delicious!!!  The sauce they serve with your meal was very tasty!! It was a GREAT MEAL!!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal customer service. Food came out hot and looking delicious! Can't wait to dig in :)"}
{"text":"Why don't we have one of these in San Diego????? I love CANES! We were in LV for a weekend and this was one of the stop before we head back home to SD.  It didn't disappointed.  I love their cane sauce and the chicken was moist and not too much batter.  I prefer Canes over Chick Fil A.  The price is better & the chicken tastes better.  We need this in San Diego!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love chicken fingers. You really cannot go wrong with chicken fingers and Raising Cane's does not do chicken fingers wrong. They do it oh so right.  These chicken fingers contain all of the elements for a perfect chicken finger. They are the perfect size, the breading is crispy, and the chicken is juicy. It is the sauce that puts the chicken fingers over the top and into a different echelon. I ate five pieces of the chicken fingers and was still craving more.  The box combo comes with french fries, coleslaw, and Texas toast. They are all great with the chicken fingers. I also got the Arnold Palmer to drink which was very refreshing. I cannot wait until this is open in Orange County."}
{"text":"Meh. We were starving in Vegas and nobody wanted to go to a buffet...bastards. So we drove down the boulevard and stopped at the mall lot to see what we could find.  I was like, \"that place looks busy, we should go.\" Anyway, we went in and it was bustling. Not gonna lie, there was a ton of ghetto going on from a whole lot of directions. But what can I say, I'm kinda hood too and maybe felt at home. The register dude was nice.  Ok...so it must be amazing cuz hood people know what's up with chicken right? Well, not so much...honestly, it mostly tasted like floured chicken which I know that's what it is....but maybe add some flavor? The fries were those crinkled fries that tasted like the ones we'd get in elementary school, not bueno. The cane sauce, which they're stingy about, also not very good either. Las Vegas...do you have a Popeye's????"}
{"text":"My first trip here, very clean and I love the aluminum chairs! The food was hot and fresh and I love their special sauce too. TOAST!"}
{"text":"After seeing all my friends' Instagram posts of these chicken tenders, I had to try it for myself. I have to be completely honest in saying that... THE HYPE WAS REAL.  Chicken tenders were juicy, coleslaw was refreshing,  the special sauce was creamy, tangy, and peppery. Reminded me of 1000 island but with a twist-- pretty tasty. The Texas toast was actually my favorite part of the meal... Buttery goodness!  Verdict: Overall, the entire meal was alright. It was lacking some sort of wow-factor for me. I think something comparable, but possibly even better, would be Chick-fil-A. It's definitely worth trying at least once! But there are other yummy things in Vegas I crave more."}
{"text":"Ah, Raising Canes... where do I begin? The simplest way to describe it would be: \"In 'N Out is to burgers as Raising Canes is to chicken fingers.\" I know. Bomb ass analogy!  The chicken fingers are hot and tender (all white meat). The breading is crispy, flaky and not greasy.  The French fries... perfectly salted.  The Texas toast... garlicky and crunchy. Cole slaw is always substituted for extra toast! Save the cabbage for ya grandma! Inside tip: get 5 extra sauces and extra napkins.   Anyway, go through the drive thru with ya little chitlins, spank ya booty and sing God Bless America as you munch on some bitchin fingerlickin chicken!"}
{"text":"Man I was super excited to get some Raising Cane's chicken fingers since I've only ever had them in Vegas before.  Saw some lower ratings for this one, but I've been to like six different ones and they've all been good.  However, this one was not up to par.  Staff was fine, but the fingers were not juicy and crisp but felt like they were over cooked and dry (maybe the fryer temp is too high?).  Same for the fries which were too well done (and typically I would rather have slightly overcooked than undercooked fries).  Then the toast was a bit too mushy and didn't have that crispy buttered side while staying firm but spongy on the non-toasted side.  At least the sauce was still the same :)   Since I'm not in this part of PHX often, I'll hope the one I hit up tomorrow is better or just go to Raising Cane's in Vegas..."}
{"text":"Mmm I love Raising Cane's for chicken fingers.  Always get an extra sauce and the service is quick and they almost always get everything just right.  Fries are crunchy but not too well done and the toast is bomb!"}
{"text":"I need this place in California.  I'd heard about it in a random article a long while back so it'd been a long time waiting to finally be able to try it, and it certainly didn't disappoint me.  It's hard to go wrong with fried up chicken strips but their sauces definitely compliment it well."}
{"text":"Best fast food restaurant I've ever had. The sauce is phenomenal and the chicken fingers are great as well. There menu is simple and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Extremely moist Chicken Fingers, tasty Sauce, Bread, Fries, Soda.  A box for easy transport.  Some things just need to be simple and delicious. If you're hungry and feeling like chicken, this will surely hit the spot."}
{"text":"The tea is AHHHMAZING! I was drinking so fast I nearly choked. Lol. It's quality tea! The chicken fingers were yummy. I put LA hotsauce in my canes sauce and it was mouth watering. The fries were not fresh but I'm not much of a crinkle fries fan."}
{"text":"This place is Chicken fingers only. The chicken is all white meat, fresh and very tasty. I do not like that they only give you one sauce packet and charge you if you want more.  Clean modern restaurant and efficient staff. Great pace for kids, very much family and kid friendly. You order at the counter and your food is brought to your table which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"I love raising Cane's I have ordered close to 300 time.  I use the drive through mostly and occasionally go it order for take home if the line is too long.  Today 2/17/18 I went in to order for take home.  It was kind of busy so I didn't mind waiting.  The staff is always pleasant but today I noticed the manager, tall lady with red hair being really loud but really rude to and talking down to the cooks through the window.  I can NOT stand when managers belittle or yell at their staff in front of the customers.  It angers me to no end!  I was stressed in there I felt like I was having a stroke.  You could visibly see how the cooks were were agitated by her constant bickering to them about the time it was taking.  It was busy I didn't mind waiting.  I was more afraid they were going to mess up my order because she was stressing them out so much!!  I am definitely going to complain to the general manager about her.  I was very angry that she was so mean to her staff in front of customers.  Totally unacceptable!!!"}
{"text":"We have friends that have compared this place to Chik-fil-A. Do I agree with this comparison?  No.  I don't get this place. The people are super friendly but other than that I don't see what the hype is about. The chicken is ok. Fries were soggy. Sauce tasted like mayonnaise, ketchup, and spice?  My husband did like the sweet tea, tasted like the tea we were used to in Mississippi.  Maybe I just don't know enough about chicken fingers and what makes them amazing."}
{"text":"Great service, great chicken and a different sauce. I like that they keep it simple so it's easy to get a group order together for work or whatever. The people are always friendly and professional. The food is ALWAYS fresh and not just sitting in some hot box for hours waiting for a customer. It may take a little longer to get but it's worth it. This place is how I'd imagine chicken fingers would be made if In 'n Out did them."}
{"text":"I really liked the chicken strips and the sauce but I didn't really understand the texas toast hype. It reminded me of a hot dog bun. The crinkle cut fries were a little too greasy for me but the coleslaw was pretty good and I am the type of person who doesn't really like coleslaw. THEY ALSO HAD THE GOOD KIND OF CRUSHED ICE WHEN THEY SERVE DRINKS. (I was in the drive-thru). I didn't get to take a pic of my meal because I was already eating it but I got the Caniac meal and shared it with my mother."}
{"text":"I love the fact that this place has a simple menu and a very casual and relaxed vibe:  posters of singers from the 70s, a disco mirror ball, very friendly staff members who seem to be having a lot of fun as they work. The chicken fingers are good - light and crunchy, seasoned just right. Crinkle-cut fries were OK, although I wish the Texas toast were a little more garlicky. I'm glad to have this cool addition to the businesses in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Fist time in Vegas , I was looking for some fast food that I've never tried before so I went here and that shit is amazing , got the caniac combo and it was perfect , got more fries instead of coleslaw , gave me a whole box filled of fries with 6 tenders and a piece of garlic toast with two came sauces and two honey mustards and got a root beer all for $9 and some change that's crazy cheap . I'm about to eat here again today it was so good ."}
{"text":"Very good food ! Although the drive threw employee was extremely rude! Would recommend but would not go through the drive through was handed the food very forcefully and was not treated with respect.   Again went threw the drive through and they were extremely rude , accidentally  passed the window to pay and they didn't even know our order. Then the lady said \"getting your drinks don't leave yet\" as if referring to as being dumb."}
{"text":"Love this location! spilled my tea when the lady was handing me it thru the drive through and she gave me some paper towels and a large sweet tea to replace it. I always get fresh fries and chicken too."}
{"text":"Duh.. It's Cane's why wouldn't it be five stars ? It's perfect if you're looking for you're quick crispy chicken with their yummy sauce to go with it."}
{"text":"Did you go to an SEC school? Do you remember Guthrie's?  If you have fond memories of both then Raising Cane's is just the spot.  The fries, fingers and sauce are all the same, the only difference being the toast is more \"Texas\" than at Guthrie's.  Also, the tea is a lil less sweet that the sweet tea at the Auburn Guthrie's which is fine actually.  Nice, clean, open space and friendly staff - definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm not just going to Raise Cane, I'm gonna raise the roof when it comes to this chicken!! Ok, that was corny, but seriously, you can't go wrong with Raising Cane. It has been years since I'd visited here, but I was in the neighborhood, and thought, \"why not?\" I'm SO glad that I stopped in!   The store was pretty busy with a lunchtime rush, but everyone was super friendly and attentive. One of the servers even came to my table halfway through my meal to make sure that everything was good and that I was enjoying my food. What fast food restaurant does that??! The prices are very reasonable as well.   And now, the food... DELICIOUS. I just got the 3 piece box, which includes 3 chicken tenders, fries, and Texas toast. It was just amazing. The chicken tenders were HOT (I almost burned my mouth), juicy, flavorful, and the breading was just the right amount. The sauce was good for both the chicken and fries alike. The fries were just fine, regular crinkle fries, but the Texas Toast?! I think that I have reached bread nirvana! I swear, I could have eaten this bread all day. It was soft, buttery, melt in your mouth, and just perfect. I found out that I could have gotten a second piece of toast instead of fries, which is exactly what I will do next time!"}
{"text":"When it comes to chicken fingers, nobody does it better. Their lemonade is also fantastic."}
{"text":"Wow went here for lunch and it was really good. They do chicken and they do it well! Differently worth the stop, very good chicken and fries.  Looking for something quick and cheap, this is your place!"}
{"text":"After a few years of hearing about Raising Cane's and never trying it, I decided to take my friend's kiddos to Canes for lunch before we saw a play nearby.  I was totally blown away by how yummy the chicken is! Their menu is small at I believe four combos, plus a couple of kids options.  The chicken is tender and juicy and I don't know what their secret sauce is made of but it must be from heaven.  I can't wait to go to Canes again. I would venture to say that if you are craving Canes, go early because while there wasn't a wait for us, quickly a queue formed inside AND out! I guess everyone else likes Raising Canes too!"}
{"text":"Was in the area looking for something tasty for lunch. Ran into a nearby BBQ place that looked awesome but I just didn't feel like spending $20 for lunch.  Saw Raising Canes in the parking lot and popped my head in. Went with the 6 piece tenders, with a 32oz drink for $9.17 with tax. Gotta love it!   It came with coleslaw and two containers of their special sauce. I don't like mayo or anything mayonnaise based so I didn't eat either.   I got some Louisiana hot sauce and dug right in! The chicken was hot and fresh and absolutely delicious. Fries are tasty but they don't give you very many. The Texas toast is also super good. Fluffy and fresh!  I am from the southeast part of the USA and this place is often compared to a place there called Zaxby's. I think it certainly rivals them but the sauce variety at Zaxby's is better so that's something I love about them.   Either way, you'll love Raising Canes!"}
{"text":"I heard of this place after I talked to a friend of mine that just loved the food here. I'll be honest with you, chicken fingers and fries were not a type of food I particularly loved until I tried this. I live relatively close and I go there once a week now on average.   The food is delicious, the staff has always been friendly (eating in or drive through), and the prices are super reasonable."}
{"text":"Brian was very quick to resolve a recent issue that I had experienced at his store. He was very understanding & hospitable when we came by. He made sure that he took care of us. Your follow up was greatly appreciated. Thank you so much. We always come by this location & their food is always up to par."}
{"text":"I high recommend to avoid this Canes Location. This is the closest location to me and it's the worst. The staff is lazy & rude, I can not tell you how many times I've seen employees get complaints and then pulled aside from their manger. So many mangers running around can't even get their staff together or even cleaning up a dirty ass table even when ask. I find it so ridiculously when upon paying if you use card they ask for ID, what is this? I'm buying chicken fingers not fucking jewelry. Also, don't go through the drive thru. It's a known fact that they give you the smallest chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Let me tell you. I've been to a lot of Cane's in Arizona and by faaaaaar. This is the best one! I live 5mins to a Cane's (Peoria) and it's the worst location. Fiancée and I always go out of my way to come to this location. Credit to an employee named Will. Always recognizes us and gives a great convo! Hard worker too! Excellent service. Fresh food! The only downfall about it is a bunch of annoying teenage at times but what are you gunna do lol seriously love this place!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I thought that the only good thing about Canes was the Sweet Tea and the Texas Toast....and really, how can you mess up tea and toast?  I thought that the rest of the meal was lackluster and overpriced. The chicken fingers were TINY, and virtually everything was woefully lacking in seasonings.  *yawns*"}
{"text":"Yesterday I went to canes and I received phenomenal service by one of the cashiers on the second window she's was very nice and polite."}
{"text":"I ordered the big box meal in the drive thru, it comes with 4 pieces of boneless chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, Texas Toast and a Drink...due to heavy 5pm Vegas traffic it took about 20 minutes to drive home about 4 blocks away before I could try it.   First the Chicken; it was not crispy it was not juicy it was not dry either it was soft and tender to eat and only slightly warm.  The dipping sauce is like thousand Island dressing without the minced pickles similar to the In and Out sauce packet.   I can say with all honesty, I prefer KFC original chicken it's much tastier in my opinion.  The Fries were soft and limp, the coleslaw was a Little creamier than the KFC version, the Texas Toast was the best part of the meal and the lemonade was okay.   Summary: maybe it would of tasted better if I had tried it fresh without the 20 minute wait before digging in /shrug...I doubt I'll ever go back with so many other choices of restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Retro-review from April 2015 I told my cousins I wanted to try fast food that belongs only to Las Vegas so they brought me here. They have a very simple menu, but everything was great!!! Chicken tenders were soft inside and crispy outside but without so much batter and oil. I loved their bread!!!  Their ice tea tastes simple yet delicious! The staff were friendly and courteous.   Only comment is cleanliness. But I guess because so much people eat there. But they gladly obliged to our request to clean up our area before our food was served."}
{"text":"I am not usually a fan of fast food, but I will give Raising Cane's a pretty solid score.  It is very clean inside and very attentative service.  A very limited menu offering but solid food.  The chicken is moist and succulent and the fries are the typical frozen fries.  You do have to wait a few minutes for your food though.  They are cooking it a la minute (to order).  I am pleased with these guys so I will go back!"}
{"text":"I just can't get enough of these chicken tenders. Ordered the Cainiac Combo with extra bread. Drive through was fast and the lemonade tasted like old fashioned carnival lemonade."}
{"text":"It's always a hit or miss. Sometimes my chicken is delicious. Sometimes my chicken is raw. Sometimes they ask for your id with your card purchase. Sometimes they don't ask. Consistency is needed."}
{"text":"Oh Las Vegas, the land of plentiful Raising Cane's locations! Even though there are more Cane's locations in SoCal now, they're still mostly out of the way for me. And with my friend from Idaho having never been to Cane's and BADLY wanting to try it, you knew we had to send it!  Not too hungry on this particular day, so I kept it simple with the Box Combo instead of the Caniac Combo that I usually get. Quality was what I would expect from a typical Cane's location. Definitely have to get extra Cane's sauce! And I found out you can special order your friends to be extra crispy. Trust me it's worth it, because they have to make your fries extra fresh!  Service is excellent here, no complaints from me. And since there are so many Cane's locations in Vegas, it wasn't too packed. This would NEVER happen in SoCal. To be fair, we did actively avoid the Cane's location that was closest to the Strip. That decision paid off in spades!  Parking is incredible easy here. Thank god for that.  Bottom line, if I were on the Strip and wanted to hit up Cane's, this is the location I'd go to. Zero desire to try the location on Tropicana, I can imagine how much of a mess that location is."}
{"text":"Sooooo I didn't realize that Las Vegas happened to be the land of AN EPICALLY HIGH AMOUNT OF CANE'S LOCATIONS until recently. Recently of course being after my first sojourn to Cane's back in Costa Mesa. Well, I was starving and I needed something quick and not too expensive, yet tasty and satisfying. Yep, Cane's to the rescue!  Sometimes you don't even need all the other stuff. Sometimes the only thing you need in your life is the perfectly breaded, yet super moist chicken fingers with one of side of Cane's sauce to hold you over until your real dinner. As far as holdover meals go, there are many many many far worse options than coming to Cane's. :P  Service was very very good here, especially considering Cane's is technically a fast food joint. Everyone had a smile on their face and they were quick to pick up my trays once I was done. It does help that it's not as busy as SoCal, although I suspect that's probably due to the EPICALLY HIGH AMOUNT OF CANE'S LOCATIONS in Las Vegas. Which also means seating is quite plentiful in here.  All I can say is...please open more in California."}
{"text":"Always the best place for chicken! Their sauce is amazing and Texas toast is to die for! I walked 1.9 miles from the Silverton Hotel for this! When in Las Vegas, a must stop for some chicken strips!"}
{"text":"Located on a long street off of the Las Vegas Strip, this is always a good option when you're hungry and don't want to wait in buffet lines.  The neighborhood isn't the greatest but also isn't the worst.  Parking is ample and service is prompt.  The only issue I had was that I was approached twice and asked for spare change while dining.  This is an older option compared to the location on Tropicana but is still well maintained.  They don't provide ice at the self serve counter so you have to get ice from the cashier.  Servings are huge and the food comes out perfectly hot. Not too hot or luke warm so you know  it's fresh and hasn't been sitting.  I'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"tender,crispy, finger lickin good.."}
{"text":"There is no debating that RCs has the best fried chicken in Arizona. The box combo (extra toast, no slaw) is perfect in so many ways but honestly it is a crime that it only comes with one cane sauce. The crushed ice is the perfect size. I got the sweet tea tonight which was sweet but not overpowering. The staff at the RC's on Scottsdale road and Shea is super friendly, but honestly the chicken fingers in the West Valley are a little bit larger."}
{"text":"This food here is really good, addictive, and bad for the waistline. The other reviewers are right, I think, in saying that the Cane's in the valley are all good-- I haven't been to one yet that has disappointed me by the service or food. Great, fresh chicken and fries. It's terrible for you, nutritionally and calorically (that's a word, right?) but tastes awesome."}
{"text":"Not sure what is going on here but it seems to be going down hill. Had great experiences here for a long time until a month or so ago.  Practically every time now at the drive through window, they will get something wrong. It does not matter how many times you correct them. I ordered an extra fry, they repeated it back as an extra toast. I corrected them and they are like \"ooh ok, we'll get that changed right away to an extra toast\" Told them again, no, I wanted an extra fry. Finally they repeated it back as an extra fry. I got to the window to pay, and she repeats back the order with an extra toast. Had to do the same thing here. Also had to change the price of the order since a toast and a fry cost different. Finally I get to the final window, and she says \"here is your extra toast\" I send it back and tell them I ordered an extra fry, she says \"oh sorry, I'll take that for you, let me get your fry\" she takes my box and comes back a minute later with a \"new\" box and says \"here is your fry\". I drive home and open it up, and its toast.  Pretty much something like this has been happening almost every time I visit now. Another example is where I got a lemonade. I get it at the window and I look at the lemon wedge in the cup, its brown and moldy. I ask for another lemonade because the lemon wedge is nasty. They just pluck the lemon wedge out and put a different one in using the same cup, with the same lemonade that had a nasty mold covered lemon wedge in it a few seconds ago.   It is a real shame because I really love Cane's, but when you the employees struggle against you it does not make a good experience."}
{"text":"Just had the worst interaction with a Raising Canes employee I have ever experienced. In addition to the unpleasant treatment from the worker, we waited in a 10 minute line just to get to the window and only have half of our order placed. We drove roughly an hour round trip to get lunch and highly regret the decision. Tyler took our order and she caused us to lose our appetite. However, the manager Amber was extremely apologetic, helpful and sincere. Just worth spreading this experience."}
{"text":"I love me some Raising Canes but I love good customer service a lot more and this location is lacking.   Have been here a few times and had issues but this one I felt like sharing because came here with my aunt and it was my idea and wanted to share with her this great chicken finger place.  Went through the drive thru... said specifically as follows... 1 six finger combo with canes sauce and honey mustard, was told it only comes with 2 sauces and others would be additional, said ok and said 2 additional honey mustard.   Then wanted a 3 finger combo with canes sauce and honey mustard.   Got the order and only had 2 honey mustard sauces.  The girl working there whose name was \"Craig\" said she only charged for 2... and we said we had asked for 4. We'll we had said the order correctly.. then we were charged $1.07, had to take out our canes order, returned one of the canes sauces and got another honey mustard.   Wow Raising Canes..... over some honey mustard.  I had the money and wanted the sauce up front. Will never go back after what I had to go through ... and what a bad taste it left trying to show a family member this place. Great job!"}
{"text":"Best Chicken fingers EVER! Love everything here. The Raising Cane's sauce is also the best dip I've ever had! Definitely recommend this restaurant, we always come when we are in town!"}
{"text":"Good Canes location, only problem is its kinda a victim of its own success in that during prime meal times it can be hard to get a table, and when one opens you gotta grab it before it can get cleaned and sit in someone else's chicken crumbs and grease.   Here's the secret for Canes tho - Breakfast Chicken! A lot of Canes (including this one) open at 9 AM, I figure a chicken basket isn't that far off from chicken and waffles for breakfast (its pretty much the same thing without syrup). There's hardly anyone there until like 10:30 or so too, plus early in the day you can be sure you're getting strips fresh out the fryer, which makes them twice as good.   Listed hours are till 1 AM every night but note the dining room actually closes at midnight. You can stay in there until 1 if you already ordered, but they lock the doors to new orders at midnight, its drive thru only for the final hour."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is simply amazing. Best fast food joint and will definitely satisfied your chicken strip craving."}
{"text":"The closest I'll get to Chick-Fil-A in these parts.  Decent food.  The highlight is their amazing sauce.  I don't know what's in it, but I will eat it on EVERYTHING - chicken, toast, fries.  Oh man oh man.  Parking kind of sucks since it's in a busy area and I have no experience with the drive-thru.  Sweet tea is overly sweet... I usually mix half sweet tea, half regular tea + a packet or two of Splenda.  Meh.  Service can be slow but at least the food is fresh.  Every now and again their chicken just tastes slightly off - I can't pinpoint why, perhaps different quality batches that come in - but the fries and toast are consistently good.  This location is kind of close to where I live, but not close enough to make it convenient.  Also, the boo isn't too fond of it so I don't really go here that often.  If I am ABSOLUTELY craving southern-type chicken and have some extra cash, I may venture this way.  That's a big \"may.\"  Honestly, I'd probably just go to any fast food place that was closer and end up spending less in time / gas / food."}
{"text":"Best sweet tea in town!!!!  This is a new location off of Tropical and Decatur just south of the north 215. It's next door to the Winco and just south of nasty Burger King. And across the street from AMPM gas station and the new LVAC.  The drive thru is packed and so is the lobby. I like the chicken strips but they need some southern flair added to them. I'm talking country gravy. I'm from Texas and that's who we ate them back home.    Stop by and support this growing area."}
{"text":"Really good.  Chicken is juicy.  Batter is crisp, but not too thick and perfectly seasoned.  As far as chicken fingers go, these are really good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite fast food joints. The food is great quality and they never ever ever mess up your order! Our food always comes fast and everybody that works there is really helpful and nice. Also, if you have your dog in the car with you they will usually offer you a treat for him/her."}
{"text":"This place has never let me down.  Fast service, great food and their dipping sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"The sandwhich combo is amazing and a great deal compared to other fast food chicken sandwhiches.  You get more chicken than anywhere else and you can't beat the Cane's sauce.  Who cares if the combo is about 1000-1200 calories? :-P"}
{"text":"I had an enjoyable dinner here as the Chicken Fingers were very good as was the sauce, the fries were good as well. The sweetened Ice tea was excellent and the bread I love it. Everything was fresh and hot and I look forward to going back"}
{"text":"Yesterday I ordered the three finger combo and it was good. The Chicken was very good and the fries were good as well I love the bread and the drink which was sweetened Iced Tea is something that I love as well."}
{"text":"Great location chicken is good great customer service very friendly employees don't like the frys but everything else is great"}
{"text":"Food was not bad, but the place was dirty  Napkins on the floor, drink station messes with soda on the counter. Floors were sticky. Tables were extremely dirty, the booth deaths had food on them.  I do not recommend going inside to sit and eat, you will just be disgusted.   We had our food to go."}
{"text":"Cliff, the manager is the BEST! Our eight year old picked Raising Cane's for his birthday dinner. Cliff and his crew went ABOVE & beyond to make it the  best birthday EVER! They even surprised us and sang happy birthday! They were super patient & great with us!! This is the BEST spot to eat! Food was amazing also! Thank you Cliff & crew! You are AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"if you're in Vegas and you want something delicious and fast that you can only get here and texas (from what i know). Chicken Finger HEAVEN!!!! oh yeah! dont forget the sweet tea!"}
{"text":"So when it comes to this location it's not my fav . The parking and location for this location is not ideal. Especially on a weekend, good luck getting a parking spot if you are planning on dining in as we usually do and watch on the pedestrian traffic and drive thru traffic.  The service I get here is sometimes on point and sometimes it's not. Chicken and sauce is always 100% though and that and the sweet tea is why we come. However this visit the sweet tea was a huge disappointment. It's about 5:00 on a Wednesday and the tea taste old and not as sweet as usual. I have never once had to add my own sugar and I had to.... and it just didn't taste good. We poured it out and tried for the coke and that was not a crisp refreshing coke taste. We reported to the staff that it didn't have enough syrup and they said it tasted fine.   In case it had been just me, I wasn't going to say anything but I had watched two other people pour their coke choice into dispenser as well before reporting it to the staff. Saw the manager try the coke and say it was fine.  So besides the disgusting beverages it was good.  We went to Carl's Jr. to compare and make sure we weren't crazy and huge difference. Wish they had done the same or changed whatever or added whatever to please us and would have gotten a higher rating and maybe other people wouldn't have poured out so much Soda."}
{"text":"I love my Raising Canes #1, Phoenix, AZ... yes indeed!  when they first open until last night I have been venturing to this Raising Cane's Store, and I don't even eat chicken tenders when I eat out!!! That's bible! My daughter, started working for this same store and she was an employee for a year until she just left to venture on into her future as a full time student in MD.  She loved working for Raising Canes, it also helped that she worked with the best crew ever, from the crew member's up to the managers who worked just as hard...this place is family oriented inside and outside, from the warm welcome of \"welcome to Raising Canes where the Chicken is kick'n and the sauce is boss!\" or as my daughter and one of her crew member's say (they made this one up of course) \"my chicken be lick'n, my chicken be kick'n, my chicken is off the chain, and whenever I'm think'n 'bout my chicken, I'm think'n 'bout at raising Cane's!!\"  by employee Alexis A. and Amber S. & manger Joseph ! Woohoo Raising Canes in the house! (This Franchise out of Nevada is the best to work for ever ) great experience for my daughter 2nd job ( because she had two and was going to school, you go girl!) I do hope they open a store in southern California; I sure would work for them in AZ to California since Cali's where I'm from... Hey Jason if you all (marketing Team) are reading this (Alexis A. mom / #1 store crew den mother wants to work on the crew out in the field !!!)  *** If you haven't tried it yet, you have to try the honey mustard sauce... OMG the best I have ever tasted !"}
{"text":"Fast service and tasty chicken. Bread is good along with the sauce. Only issue I had was some tweaker outside banging his head against the wall and then nodding out. Horrible site to see but not the restaurants fault."}
{"text":"I just moved here from Las Vegas and though Phoenix basically has everything anyone could ever want, they didn't have Rasing Canes and I ate at my location back in Vegas every week for like three months before I moved preping myself to be without it. Well go figure they open a location just three miles from my new apartment the month I move to Phoenix! I feel so warm and fuzzy inside!  I love this place because the chicken is always super fresh, the fries pair perfectly with it and the big texas toast with \"The Box\" is just right. The caniac sause goes with everything on the plate and I usually need extra! I'm not sure why people ar bitchin so much about this place though, it's basically the In N' Out for chicken, they serve one thing and they do it well. I can never get enough of this place and I highly recomend it to anyone! They always have the best, most fun and friendly service and I just love the pellet ice, I sware it makes the drink taste so much better.   Try it for yourself  Phoenix, but try it with an open mind. Go inside, play along with the servers, enjoy the local flare hanging on the walls and read about the namesake dog Cane one and two. I love this place and I hope you can see why too!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably chicken tenders! So soft and tasty. The toast is good. I wish they would give more fries with the combos. Also, they charge for extra sauce."}
{"text":"I was delighted to see Raising Cane's near ASU as I have tried it before in Las Vegas and really liked the food. Normally I get either the box combo or the 3 finger combo depending on what I'm in the mood for. If it's your first time the box combo is a great sampler for their menu on what they have to offer. Given the proximity to ASU there are loads of college students that come through here but what I like is that they are open late which makes RC a great option for take out. As far as the food this is what I thought:  Chicken Fingers = Main reason for coming here in the first place. They are definitely above average and go well with the dipping sauce. Texas Toast = Nice and soft and I like the flavor. Coleslaw = It's just okay but goes well with the box combo meal. Nice to see some veggies though. French Fries = They are okay, just your average fries I guess. Keep in mind that they are crinkle cut instead of regular fries. Sauce = I'm a fan of the sauce but I do wish they have more choices of sauces in general, as this seems important for finger food.  Overall a great spot and despite being fast food I do like coming back here. The service is fast and the pricing for the combos is great value."}
{"text":"I have been twice in the last 2 months because it was that good. I don't get fast food often but when I do I find myself craving this. Everyone working their seems to enjoy their job, which to me means they are either paid well or treated well. Which is always something I like to support. My first time there I ordered the 3 strip meal and they have me 4 because they felt they were small strips. I thought it was a nice gester, I didn't even see the strips and they just gave me a 4th one. Them taking care of the customer before the customer can even have an issue is a major plus. The food is amazing and that bread, my gosh it's good. Their special sauce is pretty good as well. Definitely going to take visiters here. Yum"}
{"text":"Who would have thought that a fast food restaurant that specializes in chicken tenders could be so good. Every time I am in Vegas I stop by for lunch. My wife and I have been coming here for years. I wish they would expand into California because damn its addicting."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great.  Just standard chicken strips.  The service, however, was the best service I have had a a fast food establishment.  The staff was wonderful.  I would choose Cane's over another establishment because of the staff."}
{"text":"Tried Raising Cane's for the first time.  It wasn't bad.  It was flavorful but for the price it won't be my go to chicken place.  I prefer the other popular fried chicken place (from Louisiana).  I ordered the Caniac Combo with the 6 tenders.  The chicken is good.  The sauce is great.  It's just that 2 meals costs $18?  To me that is a little steep for fast food chicken.  The coleslaw was my least favorite.  The TexasTtoast was a nice compliment to the meal.  If I was with a group and they wanted Raising Cane's I would go back."}
{"text":"every time we have lunch here its alway on point, its one of the best chicken in Vegas.."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is delicious and I always end up coming here a couple times whenever I am in town on business.  They are the only show in town now that my favorite - Rock N' Roll fingers has closed.  Their chicken strips are big and fried perfectly golden brown as are their fries.  Their signature dipping sauce is smooth and peppery and I always have to order an extra to go with my chicken and fries.  It is more or less exactly the same sauce they serve at Zaxby's chicken.  Fun decor and fast with your order.  If you love chicken strips, I recommend this place highly!"}
{"text":"I have been both inside and used the drive thru.  Every time I receive excellent service! The employees are friendly (and some are downright hilarious)!  I am not a big fan of the toast so they always give me extra fries.    The drive thru line can be long but it goes fast.  I've waited when all I wanted was a tea or just fries and tea."}
{"text":"Great location first off. If your from this area, you know how much we appreciate that In n Out right across the street, and the Weinershnitzel on the other side of the light. :) Then they added greatness by adding this Canes. I used to drive all the way to the Charleston and Decatur area Location but this is much more convenient.  Same great taste too! I would love to see them try a different Coleslaw recipe, I'm not a fan of theirs AT ALL!! But still, great Chicken. Great Texas toast. Great portion sizing for the kids meal also. My 4 almost 5yr old Daughter eats her whole meal and it's perfect serving for her. She collects her canes cup :) She's grown a mighty collection too. 5 stars for Raising Canes."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, delicious white meat chicken fingers, clean restaurant, and nice looking wall art. You can't get better than this.   This place is so much better than any fast food places. McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, and Popeye's doesn't compare to this place. Sadly, Chick--fil-A is second place compared to here.  This place rank at the top of the list with In-N-Out.  PS: They even clean underneath the tables. We saw them. Wow!"}
{"text":"I was hungry late at night and wanted to see what was good around my neighborhood so I checked Yelp and came across Raising Cane's. After one experience with Raising Cane's I realize that I've been living in Las  Vegas for about a month now and only discovered this place just now?  Anyway I had \"the box combo\" seeing as how it was the most popular choice and I guess I can see why. To briefly sum it up I really liked the chicken fingers which are amazing when had with the Cane sauce. The fries were pretty good and there weren't overly salty or greasy compared to others that I've had. Coleslaw I didn't care too much for and lastly the Texas Toast was a nice touch to the meal."}
{"text":"This location is almost always busy but the service is quick! Their employees are always on top of their game. From point of order to receipt of food is very fast, food quality is always good, I don't think i've ever gotten warm or cold food here, always comes out piping hot. Do yourself a favor and get some cane's sauce to dip your fingers/fries in...that stuff is the business. And if you're a fan of sweet tea, Cane's is the best outside of the south. And they also offer military discount with ID but only on combo's."}
{"text":"When we first moved here and I heard that there was a restaurant that only served chicken fingers I thought ,how can that work? For a restaurant to only have one 'main item', it better be the best product out there.  We finally broke down and went to Raising Cane's and were delighted with the experience! The chicken fingers truly are the best ever! Moist chicken, crispy flavorful breading- it doesn't get much better than that! The sides are excellent as well, and I love, love, love the dipping sauce! Raising Cane's gets an A+++ from me!"}
{"text":"It was the Sunday after a 'fun' event on Saturday night {if you catch my drift} and my husband and I were in major need of some comfort food. He was craving chicken fingers and so it was the perfect opportunity to try Raising Cane's! I love that they have a SUPER simple menu - chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, Texas toast, and yep, that is about it! I can't forget the freshly squeezed lemonade and sweet tea, of course! Clearly I had never been there before because I asked for ranch to go with my order which is totally against the Raining Cane's philosophy! They don't even have ranch. But they DO have a delicious 'special sauce' that was pretty dang dreamy and definitely a good substitute for ranch! I actually really like that they don't offer ranch. {which is crazy for a ranch lover like me to say} It is a great way to separate themselves from the pack. As for the chicken tenders themselves, they were delicious! Perfectly crispy, not too oily, and all white meat. Yes, please! I hadn't planned on eating my Texas toast but took one bite and couldn't stop! It was salted and buttered to perfection.   Anywho, i'm sure we'll be back again after another 'fun' Saturday night! ;) Thank you for curing us, Raising Cane's!"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken fingers.  Love going here for lunch."}
{"text":"Came here with a buddy couple days ago. Overall I'm not a huge fan of Canes. The food, to me, is nothing special. But, the restaurant is kept very clean and the staff are very nice. Cleanliness and staff 4/5, food 2.5/5"}
{"text":"By far the best chicken tenders I've had and they never disappoint. Everything is always served hot and fresh and the chicken is oh so juicy. The Texas toast and Cane's sauce are awesome as well. This location is always busy, especially during lunch. But even when there's a line, they continue cranking out orders quickly."}
{"text":"One of the best fast food chicken joints I've ever been to and this location is no exception. The only problem with this location is that it gets really packed around dinner time, especially on the weekends. You food is made to order and always comes out hot and fresh. If the food wasn't so bad for you I'd be coming here more!"}
{"text":"Love This place!! Everytime we come in, there is a nice greeting and great service. Chicken is awesome and the dipping sauce is on point.  Love  Love Love Canes!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fast & easy at the DT. The associate took my order & by the time I went to the window, they gave me my food. Quick!"}
{"text":"Good chicken. I love their sauce!  Fast and friednly service too."}
{"text":"The service is fast and good. Love coming here for chicken fingers with the secret sauce. The Texas toast is amazing with the sauce also. Workers are always polite and ready to attend you and get your order."}
{"text":"Best friggin chicken I have ever had. Scrumptious!!!! Delicious lemonade and some of the friendliest service I have ever seen."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by after work & grab a quick dinner. There's always a line at the drive thru, but the wait isn't to bad. Their service is fairly quick. The menu is simple, the food is always fresh & hot. The staff is very friendly and always smiling to make you feel welcome. The chicken is crispy & tender, the fries are mediocre, the sauce is alright, but the brick toast is bomb!! They should make garlic brick toast, that would be killer!!"}
{"text":"Wow their food is so good! Their chicken strips were hot and juicy, while their crinkled cut fries was crispy and delicious. I really like their cole slaw too. Service was good but food took awhile (but it's probably made fresh to order which is worth it)!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. I work in the parking lot that this store is located. It's dangerous because I want to go there constantly. Fast service, open very late and the food is always extremely fresh. Very much recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"So surprised how great the service is at a fast food kinda joint. The place is nice and roomy and well decorated. Lots of stuff on the wall to read while you waiting on your food. And the Caniac, YUM! Perfect amount. Something about their dipping sauce... its good stuff.  The sweet tea is too sweet for my taste, so I mix it with half unsweetened tea. Then I heard about the lemonade and wow, it was delish! Even when all the ice melted, well, while it was still cold, it was good.  You better believe I will be back all the time :) And they got a drive thru.. perfect!"}
{"text":"Where the Chicken is Kickin', the sauce is the boss, and the toast with the most...or something like that. I always feel like getting RC's when I hear the commercial on the radio.  RC's is a good place for a fast chicken finger meal.  The chicken is tasty and crunchy, the toast is good, and the lemonade is refreshing-not too sweet and no funky aftertaste like Minute Maid.  I like the sauce.  I think they have sweet tea too.  I'd get this for a quick lunch on my lunch break."}
{"text":"First time here this past Saturday.    I enjoyed my chicken, fries, & slaw.  Most of all I love their Texas toast & SWEET TEA.  didn't wait long for our food & staff was friendly. Prices are very affordable."}
{"text":"First time here and we were greeted by the very friendly staff! We got our food quickly even though it was busy. Amazing chicken, toast, fries, coleslaw and of course their special dipping sauce. I felt like I got a large amount of food for what I paid, but the quality didn't suffer whatsoever. The food is just awesome!!! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Good food. I love their ice tea! The sweet tea is on a sweet side for me so I usually do half and half meaning... half sweet tea and half nonsweet tea...."}
{"text":"ive never wrote a review in which i felt there should be more stars for the rating! ive never been so speechless to write a review, like words cannot explain how great this place is! AND ive never bothered to write a review for a place that is located in a state that i dont even live in-- but this place is just that good :]  what can i say? this place is THE best place for chicken fingers. i live in california, but every time i go to vegas this place is an absolute must. the meals are huge! you can definitely share with with your friend one meal and be completely full. the lemonade and the ice tea will satisfy anyone's sweet tooth. the prices will also make your wallet pretty darn happy too, since im sure by now youre completely broke after all that gambling! :[   and even during my trip i make sure to tuck away $40 just so that i can take fifty chicken fingers to go & a quart of ice tea for my dad all the way back home to california :]"}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on here. I've been going here for awhile and everything was good. Recently, like maybe the last 3 times I've been going here, I get instantly sick. Like really sick. Something not right. Won't be going back again. 3 strikes and I'm out...can't wait for chick-fil-a to come to Henderson because this is garbage now"}
{"text":"This place is so effing good! We were here in Vegas for a week and once we discovered this gold mine ( thanks Yelp!)  we came here almost every day. Caniac combo is awesome. The only thing that could make this better is if they had the Coca-cola Freestyle machines here too. (They do have the good ice here however.) service is great! Please open some of these restaurants in San Diego. PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Second time here and finally writing a review.  The first time I was pregnant and I think that was effecting my taste buds and overAll opinion of this place. Two years ago I would have given it a one star. The smell of the place made me want to vomit and the food tasted horrendous. I think it was the smell of the grease that had the affect of me.  Now, though my uterus is unoccupied and feeling happy. So we came here a few days ago to give it another go. This time I could actually walk in and breathe. Yay!  There was extremely busy and that's muy bueno!   Not such a fan of their limited menu. Got the chicken sandwich which was very good and loaded with chicken. The fries come in a large Amount, more than I expected. And I'd love to know what their secret sauce is made of. Not because I like it, because I didn't but because my husband is obsessed with it.  Sweet tea is delicious and fresh, their lemonade is awesome. Freshly squeezed throughout the day and perfectly sweet and sour.  The customer service was fantastic. A manager came over to ask how we were doing and answered my husbands questions. 1. If they were going to build one closer to redrock.. The answer was no. And 2. If they were going to bring it to the strip or east coast.. The answer was also no. Boooooooo ;(   Anyway, another worker came over to ask how everything was, if we needed anything and took our empty plates.  For a chicken, fry place that's basically fast food I was surprised by the level of service,"}
{"text":"If you love chicken fingers this is a great place to try. I'm particularly in love with this location because when I was moving into my current house I stopped here for lunch and when it came time to pay for my meal the cashier told me that it was free today. Some customer before my paid it forward by paying for strangers meals. It was just before christmas. What a great welcome to the neighborhood.  Regardless of my awesome experience the food here is always great for fast food."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers in town.  This place is just spectacular, but don't tell your doctor you went there.  :)"}
{"text":"i usually love canes.... but today i went with my boyfriend and i left infuriated. after eating my chicken i reaches in the box for my second piece of toast that i SPECIFICALLY had asked for BOTH sides buttered. To my dismay they had NOT followed up with my entire order and forgot about it. so much for \"texas toast\"... am i right????? The only reason i will be leaving 3 stars is because the chicken was okay i suppose but i could have made the exact same thing at home by pouring a bucket of grease!"}
{"text":"Cane's chicken tender is definitely my favorite fast food. The sweet is refreshing especially in the Las Vegas heat. I love the crinkle cut fries and most of all the special cane dipping sauce is delicious.  I don't have a Raising Cane's restaurant near my house so when I'm near a location I go crazy with multiple visits. BTW, this location is top-notch for fast food and great service. The manager is all in one: manage, cook and cashier. Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"1.) crinkle cut fries!?!? come on, this reminds me of microwavable crinkle cut fries i used to eat back in the late 80's. makes the meal seem so cheap.  2.) the chicken is actually very good quality. definitely fresh. i dont like the batter and the turd like shapes.  3.) their texas toast is pretty good. could use a little more flavor though.  4.) slaw... its slaw...  5.) lemonade + unsweetened tea = arnold palmer. i love it, its the tits.  6.) cane sauce? its just fry sauce with Worcestershire sauce and pepper. it tastes so one dimensional.  7.) for the price of a 3 piece its expensive.  8.) the only reason why its good cus my MOMMY BOUGHT IT FOR ME!"}
{"text":"Fresh chicken tenders everytime. The line is always long so that should let you know the food is good. The only thing I don't like is when they stack the tenders in top of the fries and now you have soggy fries. The sweet tea is also a must have."}
{"text":"I love raising canes but I'm not pleased with this location. Came inside to kill time and placed my order. Asked for extra crispy chicken and received burnt fries. I also asked for honey mustard sauce instead of canes sauce and got charged for the that. I wouldn't be baffled if they didn't act confused about what my order was after I sent it back. The inside wasn't clean. There were crumbs on the seats and the tables weren't wiped down."}
{"text":"Sweet tea by FAR closest comes too authentic. The only reason I know is because I been too Atlanta, GA few times in my life. Same region never knew what sweet tea was till those visits. Not many places around town that know of even have it on the menu. It really perfect pair between the chicken fingers and refreshing not carbonated drink!  The chicken fingers are awesome. They use real chicken meat nothing process like most fast foods. The batter is light not super heavy dense and settles in stomach for days. Fried right not dark but nice golden brown and the chicken hot/moist every time. They do every order fresh! The dipping sauce that comes with the fingers really enjoy and goes well with the chicken.  The restaurant if go during lunch be warned gets packed really fast. Most part people going in and out. Not that long wait too sit down. Whole staff is friendly and always have manager goes around the restaurant checking on customers. They ask is everything is ok. U feel personnel touch. Nice change pace have management going around see them present and keeping customers Happy."}
{"text":"I felt like a little kid eating really good chicken fingers and French fries, there aren't many options here. The staff was super friendly and the stand out item has git to be the buttery Texas toast, the fries are nothing special and the chicken was ok. One dipping sauce per order is a little cheap for the $$ your gonna spend and only one flavor? McDonald's has more options, I suggest you bring your leftover honey mustard and bbq dipping sauce with you when you visit Canes.  P.S.  the sweet tea at McDonald's is way better too, sorry guys."}
{"text":"There is not much to say about Cane's besides it's so yummie and you won't be disappointed! You have to try it! Go asu!"}
{"text":"Love canes! They have really good chicken & it's fresh! We ordered our food & the chicken was so hot, so soft & so delicious. Also they bring the food to your table. Love the Texas toast is soft too it's not hard & crunchy.   I love getting the box combo it comes with 4 pieces of chicken strips, fries, texas toast, coleslaw, drink & cane sauce. Also if you don't like coleslaw you can trade it for anything else like an extra cane sauce or toast.   Also they have 3 other combos   3 finger combo just 3 strips, fries, cane sauce, & a drink  Caniac combo comes with 6 strips, fries, 2 cane sauces, texas toast, coleslaw, & a drink.  Also there's a sandwich combo  They also have kids meals.   You can also cater for parties.   This location doesn't have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"The food here is always good but the reason I am giving it one star is so that maybe somebody that works here will see this and take care of the problem.  The little Latina girl that works here right now at about 12 o'clock on Saturday is very rude and I mean exceptionally dirty looks at the customers and acts like she doesn't even want a job.  if this is the kind of people you're going to employ then I don't want to eat here anymore."}
{"text":"After a $10 taxi ride there...they aren't on the strip...their lobby was closed!!!! They should state that they have different lobby and drive through hours"}
{"text":"I'm only upset because this is the first spot I decided to stop at and it was on my mind since I began my road trip this morning from California.  I wanted extra cane sauce which I payed for and didn't receieve. Now I have canes chicken with no canes sauce. Wtf -___-"}
{"text":"Why does this location close earlier than the rest of them in the North West?? When I know I have to go down to the one in Centennial by the time I get there I end up eating Inn N Out. Bummer. Inn N Out it is."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's does one thing and does it right. The chicken fingers and cane's sauce can't be beat. We eat here on a regular basis. The staff I've dealt with our friendly and the service is fast.  The location can be a little tricky to get in and out of depending on what direction you are coming from or going to, but it's worth it.    This places gets really busy during the lunch hour and so it gets loud and sometimes tricky to find a seat."}
{"text":"Love the Canes sauce! They have good chicken and I like the Texas toast they serve. It would be better grilled on both sides but not all canes do this. I wish they had chicken salad on the menu but they are one of my favorite fast food places!"}
{"text":"POINTS: Cheap, only $1.09 per strip, Fast, Awesome sauce, fresh bread (Texas Toast).  I go to Las Vegas with others often but I hardly ever gamble. So my usual quest is to hit up a buffet. I'm not much of a red meat eater and my preferred meat is Chicken so naturally this place caught my eyes a few times. Finally the time came. it was a past buffet business hours and I was somewhat off the strip so I decided to get something from the drive thru.  #1 \"The Box\" combo was a good starter. I've had plenty of chicken strips/tenders...or \"fingers\" as they call it, but this is one of the VERY few places that has kept them juicy, tender and flavorful even after frying. Every piece was large and equal size unlike some places that gives you a half size piece but still count it as one. The sauce it came with was awesome and went well with both the chicken and the fries. the bread reminds me of the bread from Lobster rolls.  I will be having this at least once every trip to Vegas....if I keep finding places like this I'm going to save a lot of money by not going to buffets!"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because their chicken strip got smaller over the years.  This is literally the first place I eat at every time I come to Vegas, which is around 3 times a year. Their chicken strips/tenders are so perfectly flavored and fried. It's always moist and unlike any chicken nugget/fillet/strip I've ever had ANYWHERE.   Service has always been great...I'm sure not everyone loves to work here or probably has something better to do. But you can't tell by their face and service unlike many fast food places.  Their sweet tea is not overly sweet unlike Christ-Fil-A which is a bit too sweet for me."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Raising Cane, sure it's not for everybody but I personally love their fresh chicken fingers and sometimes simplicity just does it for me. If you like chicken fingers I don't see how you could be disppointed with them."}
{"text":"Seriously - if you're gonna charge almost 8 bucks for 4 little tiny chicken fingers, maybe don't be so quick to try and bilk us for 31 cents to get an extra sauce (i.e. Flavored mayonnaise).  Oh and your restroom didn't have hand soap, so not sure how the cooks are washing their hands before handling chicken."}
{"text":"Just ate at a buffet a few hours earlier. On my way home I still had the munchies. got myself some Cherry on Top frozen yogurt and then saw Raising Cane's. I was feeling some chicken fingers, the caniac combo with sweet ice really did the spot. it filled up whatever room i had left and more. Nice and clean interior, seems like a good place to chillax after long day. i probably could have just gone with the box combo but you know how it is when there's a big picture of food in front of you, i wanted it. i always get huge portions at Raising Cane's."}
{"text":"Umm EXCUSE ME! I have been missing this in my LIFE! This place is THE bomb and I'm on my lunch break about to lose my mind... Lol - SOOO GOOD! Why hasn't anyone introduced me to this temporary Heaven?!"}
{"text":"You would think \"oh it's just chicken fingers\" but Cains is different so big and juicy. After visit there I probably will not go anywhere else when I'm in the mood for a fast hot chicken finger... I like the fact they keep the place very clean. Bathroom looked and SMELLED great!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Cane's and since leaving Dallas have longed for it on many a day! Also, they have great crinkle cut fries, which more establishments should offer. Check it out, but go in knowing its just a chicken strip place, albeit an awesome one, but still just chicken strips."}
{"text":"Just moved to Las Vegas from Tennessee so I know what fried chicken is supposed to taste like, and this place isn't bad. I like it actually. If you're familiar with Zaxbys it is almost exactly the same food, down to the special sauce, with just a nicer atmosphere.   Get the big meal, six tenders, fries, texas toast, coleslaw and a sweet tea for about $8.50 with tax. Just be sure to ask for extra sauce since they don't give that much."}
{"text":"I always get the 3 finger basket. The fingers are great, but my favorite is definitely the bread and the crinkle cut fries. It is rare to find french fries that are crinkle cut and actually taste good. And this is definitely my favorite location!"}
{"text":"I always have to make time for this place I love the strips here and the fries are always delicious   Parking here is always pretty busy, but I can see why"}
{"text":"Great food and nice size portions. Prices are pretty good. One of my new favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"I recommend this place!   First time eating at Raising Canes. I was pleasantly surprised when we walked in. We were greeted by friendly faces and the decor was cute. It didn't feel like a fast food restaurant.   I told the guy at the register we needed a second to browse the menu because it was our first time here.  The manager? William over heard me and took time out to sell Raising Canes freshly cooked food and fresh squeezed lemonade. What a nice guy.   Everything he told us is correct. You can tell everything was made fresh not frozen. We ordered the 3 piece tender combo. It came with crinkled cut fries and Texas toast. The Texas Toast was toasted perfectly with just the right amount of butter and garlic. So good! The chicken was lightly breaded and cooked crisp & the chicken was moist.   If you enjoy chicken tenders then I'd say this place is your best option."}
{"text":"If you're craving some freakin' good chicken tenders, Raising Cane's is the place to be!  I love how juicy their chicken is, and it's not overly breaded like other places.  They have the perfect amount of crispy breading on the outside surrounding thick slices of savoury chicken.  And their sauce!  OH EM GEE.  Their Cane's sauce is a MUST.  They do charge for any extra cups of sauce but it's worth it because you will find yourself dipping over and over just to get that flavorful goodness.  Some of their box combos also come with coleslaw, but since I'm not a slaw fan I usually have them substitute it for an additional piece of toast.  They have these thick slices of texas toast that are salted and toasted to perfection.  I always have a personal struggle when I open up my combo box because I want to eat the toast first but I know it's best to save it for last.  When I'm thinking straight, I'll usually do half and half, but that doesn't happen often when I have Cane's sitting in front of me. They have excellent customer service and their dining area is always very clean!  Same goes for their bathrooms.  With how busy this place gets, I usually expect the cleanliness to go down a bit, but it's always on point here! The only reason why I didn't give this review 5 stars is because their french fries are always a hit and a miss for me.  There are days when the fries come out perfectly crispy, but other times they're just limp and soggy.  But it's not a huge deal breaker for me because all other items in my combo box are always amazing and I'm full by the time I get to the fries."}
{"text":"Last weekend we were in Las Vegas for a soccer tournament so I had a chance to visit Raising Canes.  On a previous soccer trip my 12 year old went there with some of his teammate and he raved about how great it was.   Fast forward a few weeks and we would be back in Vegas again for another soccer tournament. We had a game late in the evening and after the game we decided to give Raising Canes a try.   What you need to know before going is that they only sell chicken fingers, fries, Texas toast and coleslaw. I don't normally love chicken fingers but figured what the heck.    This is what surprised me:  -The food was ready before I had even filled up my soda--awesome since we were starving.  -The chicken fingers were delicious. Moist and delicious.  The dipping sauce was great and I would recommend grabbing a couple extra.  I think they are $.25 for extra sauces.  -The Texas toast was the best I have ever had.  Thick with a perfect amount of butter and toasted to perfection.  -Coleslaw--decent but I don't like coleslaw.    We are definitely coming back next weekend when we are back for more soccer."}
{"text":"Average chicken.  Got take out.  I live 2 blocks away.  Got home, chicken and fries were slightly warm.  Not too bad.  Pretty typical take out."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Raising Cane's so I'm not sure if it is bad in general or just a bad experience with this location's food. We got a drive thru order during lunch time.    Chicken and fries- the oil they were fried in gave both a strange taste  Lettuce on my husband's sandwich - he said it looked like it must be expired because it was brown and limp Cole slaw- warm. If you're packaging a to-go order can't they keep things that are supposed to be cold separate from the hot items? Didn't live up to the hype and I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"4 strips, slaw, shoestring crinkles, smokey ranch, and texas toast = less than seven bucks.  Chicken strips were absolutely delicious, not overbreaded and not greasy.  Great, great, great for the lunch the day after partaking in the consumption of high octane beverages!"}
{"text":"Ate here today.Music is way too loud.Chicken was good,but the cole slaw never tastes right.Would not take much to give it some flavor.All the booths were dirty and the seats in the booths are worn out.Needs a clean up."}
{"text":"So let's start with the food. Personally I think that they have good chicken for it being a fast food place. The sauce is tangy, good. Love me some Texas toast, yum-my.   I actually like the fact that their menu is simple because lord knows that I'm indecisive...or just want to try EVERTHING on a menu. Lol.   My only gripe with this place (Henderson) and maybe that's my fault also for not checking the first and second time around is that they messed up on my order both times I've visited this location.   The first time I was charged for a Caniac (6pieces) and I also purchased 1 extra Texas toast. Got a 3 piece and 1 extra Texas toast. The second go around ordered 2 extra toast. Got 1. So just make sure you double check your order before you leave the drive thru"}
{"text":"They need more then chicken and biscuits on the menu. It's good tho just gets old fast ya no. Make it more variety."}
{"text":"My daughter's favorite place! She got to purchase a lunch box from Cane's at her high school. She requested one day that I stop by and picked up some lunch for her, I order one for myself, it was my first time eating at Cane's.... It was mighty delicious!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru during lunch which probably wasn't the smartest thing to do because of the line.  The food was worth the wait.  I ordered the box combo which comes with 4 chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, cane's sauce, Texas toast and a drink.    Since my work is a good distance away the fries and toast got cold so I would recommend eating there if you have a decently long drive to where you are going to eat it.  The chicken was awesome!  The meat wad juicy and the breading had a nice taste to it. You can definitely tell the difference between this place and other fast food type chicken fingers.  The size of the chicken fingers was decent.  They didn't feel like they were too small or too big. The toast was an interesting addition and it really filled me up  Overall this was a great lunch"}
{"text":"Usually I get the Box Combo with four chicken strips, fries, cole slaw and the Raising Cane's secret sauce. I mostly enjoy the light breading on the chicken strips, it is similar to some corn flakes. The strips are always super hot, which is good for any quality food. Each Vegas store, from the ones I have visited, have some sort of pop art relating to Las Vegas and a famous velvet Elvis piece."}
{"text":"As fast food goes, Raising Cane's is pretty good. Tasty spices on the breaded chicken - good quality meat - tender and juicy. (Only knock is the 'pellet' style ice - no good for iced tea!)'   Update:  Forgot to mention - it was 'National Cheese Toast' day, so had to go to Cane's, since there aren't any Sizzlers around here anymore!  ;-)"}
{"text":"Everything about my experience was pretty average. Got my order to go through the drive through. Staff was friendly and efficient. I don't like coleslaw so the previous Yelper's suggestion to sub toast for the slaw was a good one. The chicken strips were average, I didn't really like the fries (soggy and crinkle cut...a bad combination), but the dipping sauces were pretty good. I would probably return, but wouldn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"Part of the (surprisingly tacky!) shopping center that just finished being built here barely a block from Downtown Summerlin, this is a much-needed Raising Cane's for the area. Put simply, this is a delicious location bringing all you expect from Cane's:  - Drive-thru is fast and friendly - Interior is modern, spacious, and almost ALWAYS busy - Parking is plentiful - The chicken, like most Cane's locations, is delicious"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite fast food restaurant here in the valley! Nothing is better than having chicken tenders and fries! The fries are delicious and salted just enough! The chicken tenders always comes out fresh; I always forget how fresh they are that they burn my mouth when I take a bite lol. The toast is flawless as well. I choose to eat the Texas toast last!  The inside is always clean! They always have ice in the ice machines and you can not beat their sweet tea! It's delicious, the bathroom is always kept clean as well.   I really dig the setup inside! I'm a huge movie fan and I just love how they have classic movie posters through out the restaurant! My favorite part about canes is how it's named after the owners dog Cane!   Overall I rate Raising Canes a 5 star! Staff is friendly and polite. The food is always fresh. I highly recommend this to any food lover and if your a chicken tender/French fries lover like me, you'll definitely love this place !"}
{"text":"Heard good things so I thought I'd try them out. That was a mistake. Long wait time in drive thru, I mean, how long does it take to fry chicken fingers. Then they hand me a drink, pouring over the sides, had to clean it up before I could put it in my car. Minor inconveniences, until we get home. Ordered 6 strips, got 4. Paid $10 for 4 chicken strips. Amazing. So I ask the wife to call, someone claiming to be the GM was there (6pm Sat night) could have been legit, who knows. Offered a free meal, but I overhead the convo, the GM seemed to be rushed, or not a good listener.. Also the Coke tasted funny, not sure if it is bad water or new lines, but stay away from fountain drinks."}
{"text":"I had a great time. Food is great. I too had a ketchup incident. I was wearing a 700.00 suit. Wanted to ask for something, but then realized it was due to my own motor skills and lack of knowledge of how pumps \"squirt.\" Thank heavens I was raised to not be a self entitled goofball."}
{"text":"Been to this Canes since it opened, will never come to this one again. First off they messed up an order and I went back to do a \"meal recovery\" that turned into a huge mess. After letting the manager TIA know what I was there for she was completely rude from the start. She made it seem like I was trying to scam them out of some chicken. I was basically treated like shit and every time I asked a question TIA would walk off and disregard me. Her actions as a manager show that she's not cut out for that job. Doesn't seem that hard to manage a place like this, pretty basic environment and meal prep. If I had known that I would of been treated so poorly I would of not worried about the meal recovery and just paid for it. 9 bucks ain't worth the hassle. Tia should maybe find another job where she doesn't have to see customers and/ or talk to them."}
{"text":"I could barely finish filling my soda and my fries are already cooked and being handed to me. Great fast service. And the price is really inexpensive"}
{"text":"Simple good food for a pretty good price. Friendly staff and quick food delivery... I generally go to the one near The Cannery on Craig Road or the one on West Sahara but I'm sure they're all pretty much the same. Interesting semi cool decor of the place."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! Happy we have one close to home now. Best chicken fingers ohhh my goodness and the dipping sauce is amazing! Must try. Lines are always long but definitely worth the wait"}
{"text":"First time at Canes for lunch today. They had 80s music blaring. With the linoleum floor, it was loud. The cashiers were very engaged in their work and did a good job.   Ordered for a crowd so I got the 25 piece tailgater with some fries and toast. It came with sauce.   Order arrived in 8 minutes which tells me it was not made fresh. Too bad.   The chicken was hot but lacked the crispness I was hoping for. I think most of it was cooked before I arrived. The fries were very limp. Not very appetizing. Most of them went uneaten.   Not impressed by Cane's but my coworkers keep raving about it so I'll give it another try someday. It just won't be a go-to."}
{"text":"Food is always hot an fresh  plus the portions are huge i can never finish what i order the staff is always freindly an professional"}
{"text":"Excellent Chicken strips and delicious sauce. Would be 5 stars except that the meals are a bit pricey for fast food and they charge you extra if you ask for extra sauce."}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place?   The menu is super simple; you order pretty much based on how many chicken strips you want. Their \"Box\" combo includes 4 chicken fingers, crinkle fries, a thick slice of Texas toast (buttery, garlicky and grilled), coleslaw and a cup of their lovely sauce, plus a drink.   I love the following: the crinkle fries, since no one has them anymore; the chicken, which is crispy without being bready, moist without being soggy; the coleslaw tastes nothing like the slop at other chicken places; their sauce is to.die.for.; and they use crushed ice in their drinks, which I love, but I'm not sure why.  Tips: you can purchase extra sauce, but it you sauce properly, one cup should do it. If you bring your dog through the drive thru, they'll sometimes give you a dog biscuit. Any business that has a soft spot for my pup is a good business!"}
{"text":"I grubbed at Raising Cane's with 3 of my co-workers.  I got the 3 Finger Combo, which turned out to be $7.00 after taxes.  FOOD:  3.5/5.   -Raising Cane's probably has the best chicken fingers I've had.  Not too much breading, not too little.  Unfortunately, that's all they really got.   -Their secret sauce mixes really well with their chicken fingers.  I'm guessing it's some sort of mayo, with a little ketchup, combined with black/white pepper.  (I'm probably wrong though.)  I think they need more variety with their sauces.  SERVICE:  4/5. -Food server brought our meals pretty quick.  Maybe 7-8 minutes.  AMBIENCE:  2/5. -It's a medium sized fast food joint.     I tend to prefer bone-in chicken (must be the bone marrow or something).  But, if I'm in the mood for chicken fingers, Raising Cane's is probably the best option."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. I get the caniac and have them replace all the sides with more toast because the toast is just that good. Did I mention toast? If you just like toast you should go there, let alone getting awesome chicken and some Cane's sauce that you should save for the toast.  Toast."}
{"text":"Say you are hungry for some Chicken strips.   It's late, you are on the run. You want something fast to put on the car seat as you drive home from a long day at the office, as I did Monday evening.   I see Mickey Ds, Chick-fil-a all fly past me as I drive. I even past that new Popeye's Chicken along the way. Nope. I've got the taste for this place, Raising Cane. Off you go, straight as a laser pointer -- straight for here.   \"May I have three or four strips please?\"    \"Sorry, we only sell Combos.\"  \"What if I only want some Strips?\"  \"It will be cheaper if you buy the Combo, because the Strips are $1.79 each.\"  LOL, I think.   \"Okay, how much is the Combo?\"  \"$8.79 for six pieces, a large 32 oz drink, french fries, cold slaw and 2 of our special dipping sauces.\"    Ahh, my Kingdom for a simple Chicken option.   \"What if I don't want all that other stuff?\"  \"It's $1.79 for a piece of chicken. That's why I said it would be cheaper just getting the Combo.\"  At this point I was beginning to feel like Jack Nicholson in \"Five Easy Pieces\", which as it turns out, that's all I wanted in the first place. LOL  So I ordered the Combo. When I got home the pups had most of the fries, our visiting daughter got half of the chicken and the large 32 oz diet soda, and I had my three strips plus the cold slaw.     So an \"A-Okay\" Three Stars experience, and zero stars for an inflexible concept."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service was great, but what the only issue I had tonight was that there was a whole bunch of teenagers playing in the parking lot in their cars.. They were speeding and there was people hanging out the cars and it drove off .. They would keep doing it over and over again .. I was in the drive thru when all this was happening for 10 minutes no one that worked here called try cops a danger to others.. Very disappointed about this.. How can this be going on in your parking lot for a whole 10 minutes I was there who knows how long it was going for and no one ever did anything.."}
{"text":"I love their chicken fingers and fries. The sweet tea and lemonade are amazing. One of the managers is super sweet and remembers returning customers! They even donated some trays of food to the staff at my school."}
{"text":"The chicken was alright but not a good value,  the pieces should be called nuggets not tenders because they were so VERY small, the price is just too high. You can keep that ranch paprica, Lawry's sauce of yours a secret....I hate it...I would rather have anything else maybe bring some hot sauce or food from somewhere else,  before you stop me I would pies the question I gave to McD's years ago,  you can let me eat what I want while buying your food for my family or we can all eat dome where else! McD's never told me I couldn't bring other food in again and I was a frequent customer, I just didn't eat their food!."}
{"text":"I've done my research, had my awful experience and found that I am unfortunately not the first customer nor the last to experience in an incredibly awful wait time. This is fast food, and there is no, NO excuse for a 25 minute wait time in the DRIVE-THRU. Before I could even say anything, the employee said \"sorry for the wait! had to wait for fresh food\". If your fast food restaurant takes nearly half an hour to make fresh food for your customers, than I'll just go to a sit down place instead.The food is good, but not worth waiting that long for."}
{"text":"The chicken strips get smaller and smaller and more bland each time I go. You're better off picking up chicken fingers or wings at a bar for the what they charge you at Cane's."}
{"text":"Chicken tastes great!! Fries were delicious! Texas toast was spot on, loved dipping in the cane sauce. I swear the Cane sauce is addicting!!! So awesome!! The staff was super friendly and nice. Also very fast service. The lemonade tasted great!!! I literally had no complaints. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This is one of my fast food guilty pleasures. Crispy on the outside and tender and moist in the inside chicken strips, crinkle cut fries, & Texas toast all dipped in Cane's special dipping sauce (get an extra one). Wash it all down with their sweet tea. Service is always friendly. Their simple menu and great service for a fast food joint reminds me of In-N-Out. The only reason I don't come here often - I feel ashamed and fat afterward for devouring a fattening, unhealthy meal. LOL. It sure is satisfying and tasty though so it's worth it. Just go harder at the gym the next day!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding location! Ordered the Hard Hat meal for 12-20 ppl through the drive through. Of course I expected to wait, but before they asked me to pull around and wait, the manager offered me and my husband free drinks while we waited an extra few minutes. After waiting about 10 mins (again it's a semi large order so I'm not impatiently waiting), the manager brings out our almost $100 meal and apologizes for the wait and gave us an extra side of chickens and canes sauces. THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Thank you to the manager for setting the expectations for the staff so high! (I didn't get his name )."}
{"text":"Hard to resist the chicken strips from Canes. Sauce is addicting and so is there bread. The crew usually seems to be run by a crew of teens that mean well and are always polite, but you'll  find that at times they don't clean up trash or spills and that can be a tad annoying (but there's always the drive-thru for that too). Not my go to RC because I'm about a 20 minute drive away but if you love chicken it's well located, clean for the most part but might have a few more teens than one would care for due to its location near Chaparral HS"}
{"text":"Although it always seems to be run by teenagers the food is always what matters and RC doesn't disappoint. Love their side bread, their dipping sauce and perfectly cooked chicken. This place does get a little loud and rowdy not to mention the crew seems to forget to clean out the trash or at least clean up the drink area but I usually keep to myself and dig in when visiting."}
{"text":"After a hard morning, we needed a Canes fix. It was my kiddos first time here, and they loved it! Everything came out piping hot and delicious  Truly a great experience,  and the \"Random Act of Caneness\" that happened when the manager bought our lunch made it that much better! Awesome lesson for my kiddos to be a part of, as well  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"The employee was helpful with my order because I wasn't sure what to order. She told me that the \"Box Combo\" was popular and filling since I wanted something but not to be stuffed. The food came out hot and ready to eat within 5 minutes. They kept this location very clean, the food was great, \"healthy\", and enjoyable. Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Raising canes is about the best chicken tenders you will get in Vegas. There sweet tea is great and their fries when they do them well are delicious. I just wish they would offer ranch sauce or hot sauce to give a little variety. Other than that this is a must stop place to eat."}
{"text":"A Friend recommended me here, and couldn't complain anything about it. The chicken fingers are delicious !!!!"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for a basketball tournament. Most of the coaches were raving about Cane's and said it's the first place they go to when they come to town and they eat here about 5 times during their stay.   After hearing that, I knew we had to check this place out... Well, we were disappointed. Maybe it was hyped up too much, so our expectations were too high...I found the chicken to lack flavor and really be no better than any other place serving chicken fingers. The sauce was good and that definitely gave the chicken the flavor it was missing. The texas toast is okay, the sweet tea is really good.. Loved it...  I would only go here again if my kids absolutely begged me to.. Otherwise, I'm good...."}
{"text":"This place is extra clean. Extra cool and they provide large cups of water. The food is extra good. You get service with a smile. The people seem to love they jobs. And you will crave the food long after they close for the night. I love this place. The chicken is from heaven and omg the fries are soooo good! They give you bread and this cool secret stuff to dip ya chicken in. Its soooo good! The place is clean kids are welcome. They always have long lines but manage to get everyone fed quick  you never take your food back here because its always correct. This is a must go to if you never been."}
{"text":"They're personable, fast and food is so delicious. A little bit more expensive then your average fast food joint, but the quality and freshness makes it worth it in the long run. Normally it's filled with teenagers, or a few family's, nice hang out spot. Music and friends, what's better than that?"}
{"text":"The chicken is good, not special. But, I am giving it a 2 stars because I was asked to show my ID in the drive thru to use my credit card. Are you serious? Likely not returning. Get real."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! Best chicken from a fast food restaurant! And the manager comped our meal to thank my son, who was in uniform  (Marine) for his service!! Totally unexpected, but appreciated!"}
{"text":"I will choose Raising Canes over McDonalds or Jack in the Box every time when looking for fast food. The food is always hot and fresh and the sauce is amazing. Truth be told...I go for the sauce. My husband complains that the options are limited but the claim to do one thing...chicken tenders...and they do them well. The Texas toast and lemonade are yummy too!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place!! I eat here about once a week and I order a caniac and substitute the coleslaw for toast. My boyfriend substitutes coleslaw for extra fries and I also order extra sauce!! The only chicken I won't get tired of"}
{"text":"Amazing! This is the Raising Cane's that me and my family goes to! All the employee here work together so smoothly and are constantly busy! My son left his phone there as an employee turned his phone into the manager! We was so scared someone might have taken it already, my husband and son went back there and thank goodness they kept it for him. Glad the find my iPhone app also helped us to know where it was! Wanted to give the person that found my sons phone but the name was not given so this is the best I can do is put this on yelp!  12/20/2017 I was feeling disappointed I have 5 kids to feed and raising canes isn't cheap...So when I get home and took a look at my order there was only 20 chicken fingers instead of 25 so decided to call, spoke with one of the managers \"Bill\" he got me calm and told me he will take care of me when I go in the next visit..."}
{"text":"Came in from out of state.  Decided to go here because of all the good reviews about the food.  Place was crowded for lunch which is a good sign.  Did the drive through.  To make it easy we ordered a Caniac and would split it between us.  Ordered a diet coke and a regular one.  Asked which was which and the worker said she was pretty dure it was the left one.  ???  When we got to where we ate the meal it was incomplete.  The cole slaw was left out.  Oh well.  The chicken is very good and the fries are pretty normal.  The chicken alone is reason enough to eat here.  It was very tasty."}
{"text":"Cane's is always packed and a very fun atmosphere, especially for teens.  Their fries are just okay, but the chicken, bread, and sauce (my favorite) are great."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers.  The special sauce was nothing special. Good service, but a one trick point and the trick isn't worth the effort. Oh and to the people who come here for the Texas Toast: get a grip, it's not even remotely garlic bread."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed with this place. The food comes out fast and hot and there is plenty of it. In the fast food world it doesn't get much better! My only complaint is that I always replace the bread with fries, and for some reason when I do this they forget the cole slaw?? Anyway, it's still a huge basket full of perfect, lightly breaded chicken and fries!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Vegas, I heard a lot of about Raising Canes but never tried it until this year, and I have to tell you that it's the best chicken fingers that I've ever tried. The sauce is insane and the sweet tea reminds me of home. Customer service is extremely important to me and the entire staff always has a smile and makes sure you are taking care of. If you've never had their chicken fingers, then you are in for a treat."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed eating here since they opened up in 2016.... I normally get the 4 chicken finger combo that comes with fries, texas toast, and coleslaw and their special dipping sauce for the fingers. Servers are always friendly and happy whenever I've visited and the food is always fresh. You can also order much larger portion for parties."}
{"text":"I been here a few times since my friend introduced me to it a couple years ago, and I like the fact it's a simple menu like some burger chains.... the food portions are just right and I love the dipping sauce for the chicken. I usually get the 3 Finger deal, which comes with a drink, fries, toasted slice of some kind of bread, and 3 chicken fingers with 1 dipping sauce for under $7"}
{"text":"Best chicken strips I've ever had!  The sauce is SO good!  Fries, bread, coleslaw...was all ok.  The chicken strips is all I'll order next time, and lots of them!"}
{"text":"What more can be said about freshly fried chicken strips, warm buttered Texas toast and lemonade with just enough twang to make you smack your lips and exhale...ahhhhh. The lobby is always clean, the lines moves fast and steadily and the cashiers are always polite. I love chicken any way I can get it and I love to get it here. Stop by and tell Louis hi, great manager with a great attitude for this great place"}
{"text":"I just had my order messed up (first time in the many times I've come), and not only did they fix my order, but they just gave me a whole three-piece combo! That's great customer service, you can trust it here, Carlos is the man!"}
{"text":"I love chicken I give this place five stars the chicken is great and the place is always clean. The staff are professional and kind. Yes eat here you will like this! They have extra good fries and toast that makes this place one of a kind. The sauce is above five stars so they are the complete package stop in today you just may see me their."}
{"text":"Interesting concept, only service chicken tenders, but they are good!"}
{"text":"I usually get great service when I go here. It's been one of the things I've been impressed with because unlike most places they didn't seem to hire bratty teenagers, but that's exactly what I got last night. I pulled up, ordered and the girl at the window repeated everything back to me. When I pulled up to the window, another employee was screaming and playing around. I'm all for having fun, but not at the expense of service. The girl at the window was obviously distracted and handed me only one item I had ordered. When I told her I had ordered another meal, she got snotty with me. She gave me my other order, which still was missing my 4 extra canes sauces. When I again told her that I needed the sauces, she was incredibly rude, asked me to see my receipt and made a big deal about how she hadn't charged me for it even though she had repeated my order back to me at the speaker and definitely included the 4 sauces. She didn't end up charging me, but the whole thing was just ridiculous. I'm extremely disappointed with this whole experience."}
{"text":"Service is getting better here. Messed up my order but they fixed it no problem. Also apparently they \"ran out\" of the peel cups and stickers cause I didn't receive one. But they were handing it out to people AFTER me??? Ok.          Update: ordered again... asked for 1 honey mustard. Gave us ALL honey mustard no canes sauce. Idk about this location.       Previous: Not pleased at all with this location. Every time I go here something is always wrong with our order. This location ALWAYS forgets my friends coleslaw.   Today I went through the drive thru at 11:40ish. I asked for a caniac combo: coleslaw for sauce, butter both sides on toast, and extra crispy fries.  My toast was normal... and my fries were soft.. my fries were like room temp. Not even warm. I'm concerned on if this location serves their food by saving as much as they can instead of served fresh. The last running the drive thru asked me to donate so she can reach a GOAL??   Anyways If you're able to go to another location, GO.  The one one lv blvd is way better than these kids.   Remember don't expect fresh fries or bread."}
{"text":"Probably the best fastfood chicken fingers you can get anywhere around town. If you are familiar with Rock'n Roll Fingers, then all you need to know is that it's pretty much the same, even down to the secret sauce. If you're not, then all you need to know is that the fingers are always fresh, i.e., never frozen, and everything is perfectly fried. The toast they give you with each meal is also very nicely done. It's thick, buttery, soft, chewy, and has a nice crispiness here and there. Mmmm..."}
{"text":"On the one hand, I don't think this place deserves the 2.5 star rating it currently holds but on the other, I can understand the disappointment..  We got the Box combo which is like 4 tenders, Texas toast, cole slaw, fries and drink.  I welcome this new kind of fast food restaurant in my neighborhood!  Its nice that you can get this kind of combo vs the traditional burger, fry, drink thing.  The prices are a tiny bit hefty - its just shy of Chipotle prices, I got this combo for roughly the price of a burrito.    That said, the tenders were pretty good!  Not overly breaded, fried right and not too greasy.  Not a huge fan of the Cane sauce - its not terrible but very negligible.  However, I do believe if you run a restaurant selling pretty much nothing but chicken tenders, you HAVE to offer more of a variety of sauces.  McDonald's offers 2 things - nuggets and tenders which comprise of what, 10% of the menu?  And they have like 10 sauces!  Anyway, more sauce options please!  The toast and the fries were slightly less done than I prefer.  The coleslaw was ok - not too exciting.  The service was GREAT, staff are pretty friendly - of course there were only 4 customers..  The atmosphere is fun and modern - random posters and pictures on the walls.  All in all, I'd like to see more sauces and a deeper fryer bath but I probably will get some more.  :)"}
{"text":"I haven't ate here in a while (trying to slim down for my wedding) however I L O V E the food. Yummy. Guilty pleasure. Not only do I love their chicken tenders by their customer service is always on point. I sometimes come super late because of cravings and they don't rush me out of there or anything. I've never had a bad experience coming to this location! :) great job guys!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  Bland chicken though it was well cooked, juicy (one star) but seemed to have been dipped in flour and nothing else.  The sauce for dipping in is tasty but if you don't like sauce (dressing) or the extra calories, your chicken isn't going to be very tasty (no spices involved).  The fries were soggy, the cole slaw was warm, and the \"texas toast\" is just a hot dog bun that's grilled on one side.  Big fail, and very pricey for fast food.  The whole experience gave me a kinda \"drenched in grease\" feeling, not good.  Paula Deen would probably enjoy it though."}
{"text":"Food is amazing fast service great customer service. I have it one star because they seem to only hire non white people. In today's world these racist hiring practices shouldn't be tolerated. You should have one person of every race to be fair. Shame on you canes for being anti white."}
{"text":"The lemonade is tasty and the chicken fingers are consistently good. Not a fan of the cole slaw so I get extra Texas toast or sauce instead. I suggest getting a large lemonade because you have to pay for refills. I think the chicken fingers are better when you eat here. The to go container makes everything soggy."}
{"text":"Love the chicken fingers. The Canes sauce is awesome and addictive. The Texas toast is delicious. I don't like the Cole slaw so I get more toast instead. The lemonade is great."}
{"text":"I just moved here from California and I'm so happy that a family friend told me about this place. The chicken is so juicy and not greasy.  No more KFC for me. I'm in love with this place. The tea is really good as well. The dipping sauce and bread were amazing as well. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"SI like canes chicken , no fault with that. Affordable pricing  Texas toast and chicken fingers, dipping sauce  are good. Below are my reason for giving only 2 stars to this fast food chain: Chicken tastes fresh when you eat hot. So don't wait until you get home. There are lot of school kids , when I went there. Could not really enjoy my food between those screams and shouts. Very noisy.  Iced tea tastes good , often wonder how much sugar they might have used to make tea taste so sweet. Well if you are health conscious then stay away from the drink."}
{"text":"So today we needed a quick dinner before meetings at our kids schools. Cane's has long been my wife's favorite fast food. The main reason I really like this place is that they only do one thing. Chicken. And in my opinion they do it very well. The chicken is always served hot and fresh. Wasn't crazy big on the crinkle-cut fries, but they were also served fresh and hot. So anyways, when in the market for good, fresh and hot fast food I would certainly head back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"If you're into chicken fingers there's no better. Always busy inside and always a line of cars at take out window. Great prices"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Cane's for a long time now and never have I ever had such rude customer service. I understand the guy might have had a long day but I work in customer service at AT&T in the mall and I would never treat a customer that way. you chose your job. you decided to work in food. and there's no reason to treat anyone that rude. Glad the manager was there. I do appreciate his friendliness and understanding. I hope that guy who was rude has a better day tomorrow and doesn't treat anyone else the way he treated my husband and I."}
{"text":"One of the best chicken fingers I've ever tasted (but the best in USA I guess. Lol!). I love their sauce and toast as well. I always order the caniac combo. My brother-in-law is from SoCal, and he makes sure he gets some Cane's whenever he's in town. That's how good their chicken strips are! The queue at their drive-thru is always long at night(just like in n out's drive-thru in Vegas), especially when it's almost closing, but not to worry because the service is fast!"}
{"text":"I'll be generous and say they try hard at Raising Cane. But I'm getting tired of these screaming at you \"welcome to...\" when entering a fast food place, or the... let's bus your tables before you are done experience.  But the real drawback at Raising Cane is the food, er chicken strips. As I wrote in my Tip, the breading just slides off the somewhat bland chicken and ends up all over your fingers.   There's no taste or flavor. No variety. No choice of Hot or Mild, Country style, Grilled, no Legs, Breasts, or Thighs; just strips.  Even the Golden Arches gives you three varieties.   The other drawback is the somewhat inexperienced staff. We ordered a sandwich combo ($5.99) and asked what six strips would cost? (The menu board only listed Combos.) I was told eleven dollars. No, no I said, what's the cost of six strips? I was then asked if I want to cancel my combo? LOL. I gave up after a few more tries.  The bill also turned out to be $15.50.  So much for eleven dollars. LOL  When I got back to our table, I noticed I was charged $0.59 for a sauce.  Now I'm not sure if that's correct, but maybe you actually pay extra for sauce here. But I didn't feel like revisiting the cashier to find out.   So sorry, I'm pretty sure this will be a one and done visit for us."}
{"text":"There was a dead fly in my fries. The drinks were all flat. Machine was out of ice. When I informed  the cashier of this all she just said \"Yeah, I think all the drinks are\" I asked if the ones in the drive thru were the same and she replied \" I think so\". She didn't address the dead fly or ice and didn't change the drink machine. She didn't try to remedy the situation at all by even apologizing. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST CHICKEN ANYWHERE  Consistently good, Always hot always fresh Once you eat there,  you will be hooked Love, love ,love, CANES CHICKEN"}
{"text":"Ate here based on reviews. Not sure why so many stars. Gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the chicken itself was tender and cooked well. The batter had no flavor, or only and oily flavor. Very bland. The dipping sauce none of us liked. Cole slaw was average. Probably won't try again. Ps kids enjoy ranch on their strips, they don't carry ranch."}
{"text":"I actually visited this one on Thursday. It was just a horrible experience. I ordered my combo and it wasn't taken correctly. So when I got to the window I was charged less amount. Then when I told the cashier that I had been charge for the wrong amount, she told me she would change in the system and then they would comp for the mistake. When I got to the window to receive my food the person said you have this combo and I told her no I have another combo but the lady said they would call me the difference. She said let me have your receipt I told her I didn't pay for them were expensive combo but the lady said she would copy it. Then she said that was impossible because she was the manager and that cashiers can't make that decision. We went back-and-forth until I gave her my card to pay the difference. And then when I receive my food it wasn't even the correct couple still. She looked at me rolled her eyes and gave me another two chicken strips to complete my order in a box."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is their customer service. Everyone seemed to be excited to work there and enthused about making it a positive experience. Both times I have been there, with my dog through the drive thru, the staff went out of their way to retrieve a milk bone for my pup and it was nice. Another amazing thing is their lemonade! Fresh squeezed, sweet REAL lemonade. Their fries are great and their Texas toast and canes sauce is to die for. The chicken here, in my opinion, is nothing special but it is good. If you are a lover of Chic Fil A's chicken, you will probably agree. I did order a chicken sandwich one time and while the bread was delicious and I like that they put canes sauce on it, it comes with just lettuce and the chicken inside is simply a couple of chicken fingers. I would have much more enjoyed a full piece of chicken on my sandwich instead of struggling to hold it together, and a tomato or two would have been nice, but like I said, it's good. Overall a good place to have lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Ask any out of town person and they will tell you that this is the first stop to make once you step foot in Vegas. A tradition unlike any other. I first experienced Cane's while on a trip in Lafayette, Louisiana and can't wait til they maybe put one in California...maybe....please???? Anyway, nothing comforts the soul quite like fried chicken strips, carbs and sweet tea."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  You gotta be into fried chicken strips and french fries to like this place.  I guess it was an OK meal, but minus one star for serving \"edgy\" cole slaw.  Both my GF and I had an upset stomach after eating there."}
{"text":"Chicken is good quality. We went in late so we could only go through the drive threw. Service was good. I would eat at this place again."}
{"text":"You just finished a suicide trip to Vegas and you're tired, hungry, and just downright dead.  Well, you came to the right place!  Raising Cane's is a must when you're heading in or out of Vegas..or both! Not only do you get pretty large portions, but the food is divine. The chicken tenders, the bread, the coleslaw...and the sauce. Everything perfectly compliments everything else on the plate. There is no one item that is not made into perfection. After you finish that delicious, greasy meal, you can wash it down with some nice sweet iced tea. This will definitely revive you after your crazy Vegas trip.   The one thing that I had a bit of trouble with was the price of the sauce. They give you a certain amount of sauce per order...but once you try the sauce, you know why you'll need more. I seriously drench everything in that sauce. But if you want more, they're going to charge you. Unfortunate, but understandable.   tl;dr - I would drive to Vegas just to get Raising Cane's...that's how good it is."}
{"text":"Fun fact:  Raising Cane's the name has nothing to do with sugar cane or pimp canes, it actually refers to the founder's yellow Labrador named \"Raising Cane\"  On with the review!  I work on Saturdays, but only a half day.  Every Saturday after I am finished with all of my work, I drive right next door to Raising Cane's and order the strips and a unsweetened ice tea with a little bit of sweet tea.  At this point, the food is too hot to eat.  I proceed to drive over to Albertson's to do my shopping for the week.  After I park, I roll down my windows, close my eyes and just enjoy the silence for about 30 seconds.  And then I eat my Raising Cane's.  This is my Saturday ritual."}
{"text":"First time we came to this location, after it was opened last month.  The employees are friendly and helpful.  We love the food esp the garlic bread"}
{"text":"Excellent service and consistently good food. Andrew, the manager is a great asset to them."}
{"text":"I have never gone to Canes and disliked what I received. The chicken is fresh every time!   Couple of hints to an even better meal: -ask for \"Butter on Both Sides\" of the toast. Theyll toast both sides for you.  -ask for hot sauce & you'll receive packets of Louisianna & then add one to your Canes sauce."}
{"text":"Wow. It's not often I give a place less than three stars unless I had a real bad experience there, like shit service, huge wait or a cockroach in the pudding. In this case, I'll make a unique exception because I encountered none of those. Confused? Read on.  The wife went here last night and grabbed dinner on the way to meet me and the kid. It's. Just. Chicken. Strips. HOW can you make any sort of chain restaurant based on that? It's bland and literally the most boring meal I've ever had. Just one (SMALL) step up from a glass of water in flavor. Let's break it down: tasteless chicken with breading that makes even Church's, arguably the blandest food in the state, taste passable; shoestring crinkle-cut fries - like Del Taco's but half as thick (why?!); boring coleslaw; boring sauce. Probably the tastiest thing in the box was the soft buttered toast, but hell if I can't make that myself at home, right? It's just so absolutely pointless to go to this place. Go ANYwhere else. Mexican, burger, whatever. I'd rather eat airline food, seriously. I felt like I needed to dip the damn chicken in sulfuric acid in the desperate hope that that could revive my clinically dead tastebuds five minutes into the meal. And chicken strips are ALL they had on the menu, with the sides as mentioned above! I was still vaguely hungry but quit eating my Caniac with half the meal to go, it was THAT un-special. Chick Fil-A is a dozen orders of magnitude better than this place. At least ~they~ have some sort of flavour. Making different kinds of breading available and giving the option for dark (== flavour) meat chicken would go a long way towards getting this place an extra star. Making three, in case you aren't counting. I appreciated the high-rating reviews I read prior to going here - additional reviews from those reviewers will help me profile restaurants I will NEVER eat at and save me a crapload of angst and cash in the future. But take your kids here. They'll love it. It's why I gave it one more star than I was planning to.  About a pound of half-eaten meal went into the trash last night. Won't ever happen again. Wife, it wasn't your fault, it was mine. And Yelp's. (presses period key on keyboard at the end of that sentence so hard that the plastic splits)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat here since it opened and had high expectations from the new chicken joint on the block.  I was underwhelmed:  The strips themselves seem to be of higher quality than other places but the overall flavor just isn't there.  The fries, cole slaw, and toast are all pretty ok and nothing special.  Standard stuff.  The dipping sauce that some people rave about is also just ok.  It tastes almost like thick Italian dressing and marinara sauce mixed with a hint of ranch.  It is ok at best and is just weird with chicken strips.  The price is a bit high.  I got one of the meal deal things and it was almost 10 bucks.  Not horrible but not a stellar value either.  On the other hand, the drive through line was pretty fast during the lunch rush and the workers were friendly.  Anyway, the next time I feel like eating a junk-food-heart-attack for lunch I'm going down the street to Churchs.  Just give me some overly fried strips of cheap chicken with some ranch and I'm happy."}
{"text":"Love everything about Cane's. They have my favorite chicken tenders by far, and their lemonade and toast is awesome!"}
{"text":"We ordered a sandwich and it didn't come with lettuce like on the picture so I asked where it was and got a snotty response \"we don't serve lettuce.\" I asked why and was told it's \"health code violation\" as if nowhere else serves LETTUCE? I let it go. We had a question and my friend tried to get the attention of a girl at the counter who wasn't doing anything and she responded \"can't you see I'm busy\"  It was really rude and we weren't being rude at all... her name is Jackie... Not to mention my meal was missing my extra sauces and bread, and I had to ask for it even though I had already paid. Not a good experience"}
{"text":"I am happy to say this location has improved their customer service and I like that they are close to my house so I can come here more often. Their chicken is so tender and everything else along with it is excellent!"}
{"text":"Confession: I don't eat chicken.  However, I had a strange urge to eat and and tried this place since my kids love it.  I didn't like the texture of the chicken nugget or the flavor at all.  One bite and I was done.  Strange urge gone.  Also, was super unimpressed by the crinkle cut fries.  No flavor.  On the other hand I loved the lemonade with the crushed ice."}
{"text":"this place never disappoints! ill always have hot juicy chicken and fresh fries. best sweet tea ive ever had!"}
{"text":"If you like chicken fingers and fries you CAN'T go wrong with this chain.  They aim to please and you'll leave fat and happy."}
{"text":"I had a good experience at raising canes.  The chicken fingers were delicious and the sweet tea was spot on!  The place very clean for a fast food restaurant and the service was good.  I recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Love the Chicken. 5 STARS, my son had a program at school where he was the marketing salesman for Canes and he told me all about the company. We love labs, as we have a rescue beauty ourselves."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's never ceases to satisfy my hunger!! I usually get the box combo, which comes with 4 chicken strips & fries, a piece of toast, secret sauce and cole slaw (you can substitute the slaw for another piece of toast =D, which I always do!)  The toast is the best part to this boxed combo!! It is perfectly buttery with a crunch on the outside, and soft and delectable inside! Best bread you will have in a lifetime!  The sweet tea & ice is also pretty great!! Eat there so you can enjoy unlimited refills! HAHA =)"}
{"text":"WHERE: Flamingo & Maryland Parkway (right by UNLV)  WHY: I have a strong gut feeling that this may be the best Cane's location out of the Las Vegas chain! Haha.  WHAT:  I have previously written a review about one of the other Cane's locations, but this is my absolute favorite location! The reasons behind my judgement is that the customer service is the best, the food is the best, and it stays 100 percent consistent!  The handful of times I have come here, I have never been let down.  There are times when the fries are either too salty, too soggy, or too crispy. Or times when the chicken fingers just don't taste how they should be tasting. But! Never has any of these incidents happened to me here!! I just may be their number one fan and proud!  The manager was an absolute sweetheart! I had forgotten my Caniac Club card, and he made it easy to accommodate me! There was one time I had forgotten my card at one of the other locations, and I couldn't redeem my box combo there! They had told me to email and or contact Cane's Corporate!! & sure did!  In summation, before I go off rambling about how much I love this location, STOP BY, ORDER SOME TOAST & SWEET TEA, AND HAVE A MARRY DAY! =D"}
{"text":"This is a second time to this new location...  Guess what????  It's still great...  The family hit the store about 11:00 this morning and we had the place to ourself... Don't know if its because of the long weekend or the ASU students haven't found it yet... Food was hot & good, service was great, place was clean and neat...  ASU, students your missing out on this place... old Devil..."}
{"text":"This is for the new store in Tempe.  we have been eating at the Phx. store but very happy new the store in Tempe is open.  One of the employees in Nevada told us about the new store opening and it was great to see her her in TEMPE TRAINING THE NEW STAFF.   NATALIE from Vegas is just great.  The service is excellent and the food is consistent from store to store and very happy with that.  Management and staff at all locations come by on a regular basics and check if everything is ok or do we need anything.  Great Service for a fast food operation.  Keep up the good work, great food... Caniac Club Member 6000405536375759"}
{"text":"My kids love this place. It makes me feel better getting this for them than the golden arches. Im in denial, but a pretty good one."}
{"text":"Saw a huge line so we decided to stop by to try it out. We had the Caniac combo ($8.29) and sandwich combo ($5.99). All of the chicken strips are fried but you can get them \"naked\" or without batter. The chicken and fries were good. Crispy on the outside and fifth and moist on the inside. The roll on the sandwich was very thick, too thick in my opinion. The special sauce was also very tasty but very thick. Coleslaw was very tasty but the Texas toast was soggy and too salty. The sweet tea is sweetened with sugar cane and good (also very similar to mcdonalds sweet tea). Good for a quick bite but not something I can eat everyday."}
{"text":"Okay  my first negative review. Seriously I don't know what people are seeing in this place. It just specializes in Chicken Fingers if you want a light snack! So it is great for you Chicken Fingers Lovers only. Ok sure the Sweet Tea is a unique thing. I rather buy the Texas Toast loaf of bread in the supermarket and eat that instead. I've come to learn some people taste buds are way different or haven't been around too much to explore different restaurants out there in the world. There are much better fried chicken chain-restaurants out there  which is much more fulfilling and worth while. Positive thing I can say, it's a nice clean building and was kind of empty when I went in."}
{"text":"This is not the first time I received my order wrong and not like doing a survey will help it because I did in the past and didn't receive any feed back. I ordered extra fries and didn't receive them. The fries I did receive were broken and looked as if they were scraps. Honestly just annoyed, especially when I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Great service great chicken, my go to spot always going when am.craving good chicken freshly made . :)"}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  Had it not been for my best friend moving to Louisiana and telling me about this place, I probably would have never tried Raising Cane's. I mean, a fast-food restaurant that only serves chicken fingers?! How good could that be?! Let me tell you: pretty darn good!  I always get the Box Combo, which comes with 4 chicken strips, coleslaw, fries, texas toast, 1 cane's sauce and a medium drink. It's just the right amount of food for my healthy appetite.  Chicken fingers: They're always tender, and never dry. The outside of the chicken could be a little crunchier, but at least it doesn't have any of the hard, chewy chunks that you sometimes find in chicken fingers (gross, I know, lol).   Coleslaw: It's very reminiscent of KFC's version, only creamier and fresher.  Fries: These remind me of a thinner version of Ore-Ida's crinkle french fries - they're pretty mediocre but perfectly salted, for me.  Texas toast: Thick texas toast, grilled with a slight buttery-garlic flavor.  Cane's sauce: I love their sauce! It's a mayo-ketchup based sauce with tons of black pepper, which I feel compliments the chicken fingers nicely... and the fries... and... hell, just dump it on everything!  Service is always top notch! They're very accommodating if you want to switch out the coleslaw in your combo to add another piece of toast, so you can make yourself a big chicken finger sandwich. And I love the fact that everything is made cooked-to-order and not sitting under heat lamps."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my house so I decided to give the a try ... Since I love a good chicken finger! Location is nice, modern, and CLEAN! The staff is friendly and upbeat, definitely do not hate their jobs.   Food is solo delicious! The fries are whatever which was disappointing but the toast is great! The sauce that they serve is to die for!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Swapped the coleslaw for toast. The chicken is always fresh...my son says they should give more sauce for free!"}
{"text":"Went here about an hour ago. Loooong wait in the drive thru. I'm feeling nauseous after the meal. The soda, chicken and Sauce  tasted weird. The chicken breading was mushy. This is my first bad experience at this location."}
{"text":"The service was prompt and friendly. They willing answered questions. The food was good but nothing I would crave. I'd prefer a little more spice.   The only serve chicken strips with 2 options for dipping sauce or a chicken sandwich. The chicken was tender but the coating lacked flavor to me.   French fries were standard crinkle cut-nothing special. The coleslaw was good. I'm always pleased when they don't put onions in coleslaw as that overwhelms the other flavors to me."}
{"text":"Tailgate platter when feeding kids and their friends. Always consistent anf better than feeding them nuggets."}
{"text":"We don't eat here enough. Out of sight out of mind. But it's my 15 year old's bday and he's requesting for Cane's. The kid doesn't ask for much so I got the Hard Hat party pack so he can invite his friends for a snack too. It serves 10-20 people. The chicken fingers were enough but the Texas toast was not, that disappeared within minutes.  The drive-thru is always busy but moves fast. If you lose your canes card, tough, you'll have to get another one as they won't take your phone number. This place doesn't need a review, everyone knows how good their chicken fingers are. Absolutely delicious, tender and crispy. The Texas toast is addicting, soft and luscious. And who doesn't love their sauce? So famous that people try to decipher its ingredients, good luck! I think I'll just enjoy the rare treat we give ourselves as to not overdo Canes and lose the excitement."}
{"text":"Instead of coming here for the chicken strips and their famous Raising Cane's dipping sauce, I come here for the Texas toast. I'm a carb lover so it only makes sense for me to order extra toast every single time. Each slice costs $1 each. The toast is made to perfection--crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and warm! The chicken tenders paired with the dipping sauce is also another must try if you've never tried Raising Canes. If you decide to opt for the meal options, you'll get crinkle cut fries along with your choice of beverage. Cole slaw is another side option. Their menu is limited, but I rather much prefer it that way because the larger the menu, the longer it takes for indecisive people to make up their mind (like me!). Try the sweet tea if you have a sweet tooth like me!   Tip: order to dine in if you want more fries. Transfer the food to a to go box yourself after if you need to take your food to go."}
{"text":"Buttery, crispy, juicy chicken tenderness! I don't eat fast food like ever so let it be known that This was my first time eating at a FF place in YEARS. Raising Canes has the BEST fried chicken tenders I have ever had and is in a different league than the competition. You absolutely cannot go wrong with the Caniac Combo and EXTRA CANES SAUCE OWRNRNGHDYR. Yeah sorry but the sauce is that good. Even the customer service I've experienced from Canes seemed stellar compared to any other fast food place I've been. Kudos Canes, I'll see you soon boo"}
{"text":"This place is over hyped. The chicken was good, the coleslaw was not. The fries were the best thing here. I went to the counter for some kind of dessert, but didn't find anything. Too bad."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with the hubby & son. It was pretty early so it wasn't busy, which was a plus. The staff was friendly which these days is hard to come by. The chicken fingers were pretty good & the toast was tasty. However, their special sauce was nothing special; none of us liked it. The basic mix is ketchup, mayo and some spices.......yuck. The honey mustard wasn't much better & if you want some, they charge you for it. They really need to add more dipping sauces because the 2 they have are not tasty. Would it really kill them to add a BBQ sauce or maybe some ranch? I will probably go back, but I'm definitely bringing my own sauce next time."}
{"text":"Wish I discovered this place sooner. Best chicken strips/fries/bread and dip around. Yummm!!"}
{"text":"Used to be a huge fan of cane's as I was in LA where they started, and was always at this location when I moved out here. But last time I was there I was turned off by a manager that was rude and disrespectful to her employees. When I asked the girl whom she degraded who she was she replied some \"bitch\" named mel. Good food but seriously cane's!!"}
{"text":"It's sad how I have to drive miles away from this location.Thats next to my house cause the food always sucks.This is my 3rd time... getting bad food I wanted no salt frys and extra crispy chicken.My food tasted terrible I've gone to a few locations.In town and have got great service.I would recommend staying away from this location.If you don't want poorly made food it's.Obvious that management is terrible there and they don't care."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Their chicken is sooo good Bc it's fresh! Their house dip sauce is like crack. Sweet butter toast is perfect pairing with the chicken. It's great Bc entire family can all agree to eating this and enjoy it together. Two caniac combos for $19 tax included. I was able to sub one meal for bottled water instead of soda and was impressed that they give the 1 liter water bottles rather than the regular small bottles elsewhere!! I LOVE Canes!"}
{"text":"I love their sauce and will gladly trade fries and bread for extra sauce. :) On our most recent visit, employee Kenton was SO patient and professional in explaining how we could get the most chicken for our $$.  Little things like that is what will keep me a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Oh my god! Friends introduced it to me, and I come to eat every time we go to Las Vegas. Got the box combo, ( it isn't in a box) but it is a yum. A must taste. The unsweetened and sweetened ice tea is not bad, but I suggest to pick the unsweetened one. The sweet one is too Over Powering sweet. The chicken fingers are tender. I can tell that they are fresh. It is mine ONE LOVE. This means i will get premium select, always fresh, never-ever frozen ever chicken fingers. It is a tourist trap worth the cost and the XP. It is unique and worthwhile."}
{"text":"If you want some fast chicken, skip the kFC, el pollo loco, church's and head over here."}
{"text":"This Cane's gets slammed because it's the ASU location! But that doesn't stop me from getting my Caniac Combo, sub the slaw for a extra Texas toast with a Sweet Tea."}
{"text":"Came with a friend since he high recommends this place. And I couldn't agree more, it's delicious and filling for the prices. I would day let the food cool down a bit as I ate it while it was burning hot and burned the roof of my mouth. Still good! Will be back again when I'm in vegas."}
{"text":"A friend of a friend said Raising Cane was the place for bomb chicken fingers saying we had to try it when in Vegas.  Well, they were wrong, the chicken fingers were ok but not bomb.   The true taste test is to try them without the sauce, not at all tasty.  ADD the sauce and they instantly become better! The other negative is that while they are served hot, they are not crispy like they should be. The fries were really salty and the Texas toast buttery and ok.  The service was good and the location clean, the only warning is go with the 3 or 4 piece fingers, anything more than that is too much.  We came, we tried and can move on....."}
{"text":"Tall guy had lots of energy like 1:30am. We enjoyed our food not only because the food was fresh but because it was prepared with the right staff."}
{"text":"My review will strictly be on what I ordered:  The Box Combo - Shared this with a friend and it was the perfect amount.  I'll start with the chicken fingers.  Obviously freshly battered and fried which makes a huge difference in the overall quality of the product.  Moist, tender, crispy, and simply seasoned.  The Canes sauce goes heavy on the cracked pepper, which I didn't mind at all.  The fries will crinkle cut fries which I think are fitting to the type of meal that is being served.  The coleslaw was pretty standard and on the sweet side.  The toast well...... I mean who doesn't love a warm, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside thick piece of white bread with butter slathered on one side? YUM!  OVERALL:  Pretty good place for what it is.  You don't find places that focus on chicken fingers so it's a great alternative for those who aren't so much into the 93457203975209384 burger joints in this country.  Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!"}

{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews? I was there on opening day and have returned several times since then. This place is busy! Service has never been slow, but lines are common due to the sheer number of people.  Any kinks associated with opening a new store seem to have been worked out. There are still crowds but service is on par with the other locations. The food is great, I love the lightly breaded chicken and the garlic bread.  Canes is like In n Out for chicken. All they sell is chicken, no burgers."}
{"text":"I've never been here before and I was not very impressed. Whataburger has better chicken fingers and fries. However, the service at this particular franchise is amazing! Every employee is constantly working with urgency and cleaning, and the restaurant was completely packed."}
{"text":"Good stuff as long as you like chicken fingers and fries"}
{"text":"Best fast food fried chicken and fries you will find. The big box that comes with 4 tenders is enough to feed 2 people and the food is amazing. The chicken is nice and crispy on the outside but moist on the inside, always cooked to perfection. Standard crinkle cut fries, but the toast is the best part. A thick slice of buttered toast that goes great with their special dipping sauce. Every time I've gone I've had to order and pay for extra sauce because of how good it is with the food.   A great place to hangout with friends and the staff are very kind.   Will be going again"}
{"text":"I love Raising Cane's! The chicken is always fresh and crispy. The French fries are crinkle cut to perfection. My favorite thing about Cane's would have to be the Cane's sauce. It tastes good with everything!"}
{"text":"Would be a 5 star if the music wasn't so loud and the air conditioning too cold!  Love the food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, outstanding customer service.  I'll be the first to admit that I was a big chick fil a fan for most of my life, they also have great food and have never done me wrong (except maybe a couple nights with food poisoning).    I discovered canes at a meeting on campus at the University where they were giving it out for free. The food was amazing and I loved the sauce even more. It instantly became my go to place for getting chicken.  However, what has kept me coming back fairly regularly for 4 years now is their customer service. I can't even remember the last time I went to a competitor. The staff has ALWAYS  been very friendly, outgoing, and helpful. I have never once been disappointed in a visit to canes and always left in a better mood. It's weird to say that for a fast food restaurant but it's true.   I have found myself coming back more frequently since I met the manager, Lewis, who is a very friendly and outgoing guy.  He is always helping out his staff and motivating them throughout the day. He is always comforting the others guests and I that our food will be right out - and will be well worth the wait ( I've never waited longer than 5 mins - even at the busiest times).   Overall if you are looking for a good place for chicken and fries this is hands down the best place to go. I would and have recommended this place to all my friends and family that come to town."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of hub bub about raising Cane's and at the advice of my new yelp pal I decided to give them a visit. I was around the outlets last night waiting for one of my gal pals to get off work, hunger started to strike and I wanted to grub on a budget. I decided to scamper on in to Cane's to see what all the fuss was about. The place was very clean, staff was friendly when i told them i was a first timer, they gave me a rundown of the menu. I ordered the 3 piece meal, which came with 3 strips crinkle fries, texas toast and a drink. The strips were perfect, no nasty greasy crap or uber salty batter. The staff is on top of their game with keeping the place clean, so bonus points for the supervisor. The sauce was pretty damn scrumptious, texas toast was good fries were nice and yummy. Wish they would do a Roscoe's type deal with strips and waffles. I would like to give a shoutout/thank you to my Yelp pal Stephanie E. for the recomendation. :D"}
{"text":"Usually hit up this joint before or after class. Offers the same Cane's goodness as the others. This spot gets  plenty crowded so sometimes seating is scarce. I dig this place for being kept clean,open late and offering good grub at  good price."}
{"text":"All the same chicken delicous-ness of the other Cane's yet conveniently located off of St. Rose. When I needs me my chicken finger fix or a late midnight meal this is the spot to go. The inside is fairly large and has outdoor seating. Staff is pretty on the spot and keeps the place clean."}
{"text":"As always, friendly staff, great service, excellent food, and great locations throughout town. Would like to see one in Boulder City and another in Hendersonbut I will continue to make the trek into town"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a while and finally got the chance to. And of all times of the day for breakfast. I have to make it clear I am a connoisseur of fried chicken. It is kinda hard to impress me when it comes to fried chicken. But I have to say this place is as good as everyone says it is. The chicken tenders are superb! Like amazing- like I could eat them everyday kinda amazing.  They are not only super juicy for white meat (cause I usually order dark meat due to the juicy factor-the breast and the white meat tenders are my least favorite) but the crispy factor was on point. It wasn't oily or flavorless. The crunch was memorable along with the taste.   I wasn't too impressed with the fries-kinda so so- tasteless and a little oily. But the canes sauce they serve is a great dippin sauce- seems like a combo of mayo, ketchup and spices.  I ordered the kids meal- 4.19$ for 2 strips, fries and a small drink. Not too bad but def just getting the chicken next time.  Def going to come and eat here again and brining my husband to experience the tastiness of the chicken here!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The chicken is always fresh, restaurant always clean and it's the closest one to the strip! And that sauce..."}
{"text":"Canes has been my favorite fast food restaurant since I've moved to Las Vegas. I used to go about 4 times a week; Breakfast( since they open at 930), lunch or dinner. I have slowed down and probably visit twice a week now. I have never written a review but it has always been good quality food and a good amount for a good price. I'm writing one today because the Cashier Kevin, I assume that's his name because it was on the receipt had great customer service from the minute I walked in to when I got food and when I left. The food was great as always. But I just wanted to give the cashier some recognition. Him and the manager on duty (don't know his name but tall guy) were great. Thank you guys keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Pretty good if you want a fast cheap place to get some fried chicken fingers and some french fries. The only thing is that I wish there was some sort of better hot sauce selection. They did have Louisiana sauce in packets which was kind of underwhelming, especially when I ran out towards the end of my meal and didn't want to make the trek to the counter just for a few bites. Yeah that sounds kind of lazy but just give me a bunch of bottles already!"}
{"text":"After recently moving to Las Vegas from CA, I was excited to find a raising canes since they don't have them in CA.  The chicken strips are sooo good, I've been to this location a few times and the food has been fresh every time. The fries are so-so but the chicken strips make up for it.  The only thing preventing the 5th star is that I really don't like the canes sauce - and I asked that it not be put in the box...not only was it in the box but it popped open and was all over the fries and some of the chicken."}
{"text":"Pretty decent fast-food chicken.  They are the masters of chicken tenders.  Pretty limited menu, but they're good at what they do.  The breading is light - not too crispy or overdone.  It's served with a tasty and somewhat different dipping sauce - honey mustard with some oomph.  If you get the box, you've got fries, cole slaw, dipping sauce, Texas Toast, and a drink for a relatively nominal fee."}
{"text":"good food but my cashier was not very smart when it came to math she tried to charge me an extra .30  and for some strange reason the place had a smell of fried catfish"}
{"text":"Super yummy, but I don't understand why there is no BBQ. Chicken shack just opened and they have lots of sauces to choose from lawl"}
{"text":"Ok if you are a little kid and like chicken nuggets. Nothing I would EVER return for. Blan"}
{"text":"We need a chain of Raising Cane's in California. Seriously, it would change the game of fast food.  My boyfriend kept raving about this place every time we took a trip to Vegas, so on our last trip, we finally went and boy did it live up to the hype! I was so astonished by how moist and juicy the chicken fingers were. Not to mention the delicious dipping sauce that comes with the chicken. Gahhh... It gives Chick-Fil-A's sauce a run for its money. Top that off with a side of Texas toast - I'm sold.  I'm going to have to come here every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The service is outstanding!  We normally don't eat in the restaurant, but today I decided that having lunch with the kids (4 & 5 year olds) would be a nice treat.  When I ordered, the manager (I'm guessing; he was the only one wearing black while everyone was wearing red) gave the kids the kids cup. When the food was ready, he bought them to our table. And this means a lot since I don't want to leave the kids alone at the table.  Then another worker came back, later, and asked if there was anything that he could do for me \"so you don't have to get up\". And I was like....\"Wow!\" So impressed.  Unless you're a parent, you don't realize \"small\" things like that are a big deal.   Thanks."}
{"text":"Cane's sauce is what keeps me going. I absolutely love the sauce! Can't go wrong with a 3 finger combo. I feel like the bread doesn't get enough attention... I could eat that all day. The chicken can be quite dry sometimes, but the sauce makes up for it. The fries, however, are pretty soggy. Other than that, I really like this location. The facility was very clean as well. I am not a soda drinker, so I'm ecstatic that they have Hi-C fruit punch."}
{"text":"So, I had a long day at work and I got off around 10:50 and I was starving! I raced over to canes and my card didn't swipe! :( the girl got her manager and the manager said \"oh, don't worry about it, it happens to everyone.\" And I got so red.. I feel so bad! But they treated me nicely! I'll definitely have to go in and give them a great tip next time or something. :)"}
{"text":"I think it was good but it didn't jump out to me as much as people hyped it up to. The chicken is a lot better coated and fried compared to most places. It's crispier and the chicken is juicy.  The menu is short with 4 items on it but there are some sides and you can order party platters for a lot of people ( or yourself ). When we walked in, the girls behind the counter were a playing around with the cook and didn't even notice us until one of the girls ran out to check the counter. It seems like kids were running the restaurant and the cook was rolling with it.   I think I'll choose a different place to eat next time I'm hungry. The restaurant is clean, so that's why I gave it a star, the chicken was nice and crispy so I gave it 2 stars."}
{"text":"YUM!    These are the softest, most tender chicken fingers I have ever had.  If there are any softer, more tender chicken fingers out there, someone please let me know!  Chick-Fil-A used to be my favorite chicken fast food joint, but this is hands down, 5x better.    Texas toast is super soft and perfectly seasoned.    The availability of sweet tea is always a plus!  The only downside for me are the fries...regular crinkle cut... I can live without them...just give me extra bread instead!  Service is friendly and fast.  This place will always definitely be my last stop on the way home from Vegas!"}
{"text":"This has to be the best fast food chicken fingers - what makes it is their sauce tomatoey with just the right fried chicken spices.  The fries are crinkly and crispy too!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch around 2:30 and ordered the 4 piece meal... Almost all my fries were little bits. The chicken was good as always and the sauce was just right... Actually I could have used another. Place was clean and the employees greatest me right away."}
{"text":"What can I say I am a \"Caniac\".  These chicken fingers are fantastic. I cannot help myself from stopping here at least once a week.  My order always comes out fresh and hot.  I pop the box right open and I can eat while driving on the road with out spilling a crumb.  Cane's sauce is finger lickin good.  Oops that's the other chicken place....Anyways if you have not had Cane's before it is a must try in my book. As simple as the concept is, they do one thing (chicken fingers) and they do it really, really, really well. Keep it Up Cane's.                                                                           ONE LOVE!"}
{"text":"This is a very friendly place. Food always hot when you get it and the employees are super nice. If you're through the drive thru a lot of times they greet you with rhyming. I love the fresh lemonade and have had this location cater for my job before. The chicken is addicting."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service.young man behind counter excellent attitude. First time in restaurant, so now will see how good food is."}
{"text":"This place is extremely clean and friendly. The customer service was awesome, one of the stand out qualities of this particular raising canes is customer service. They run your food to your table which is amazing! It makes your dining in experience that much better. Our food was made fast and served hot despite it being busy. I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"Vegas has a few joints specializing in straight up chicken.. strips?!! After a few drinks and a long ride in from Los Angeles, hunger struck and my sister recommended Raising Cane's.  The inside has a slight Johnny Rocket's feel to it.. meaning it looks like an old school diner. Outside there's a drive-thru that seemed to always be packed during my last visit, as was the inside.   The menu was SIMPLE. Combo #1; a few chicken strips, fries, Texas toast and a drink. Combo #2; a few more chicken strips, fries, Texas toast and a larger drink. This was the case for the next two combos. 4 combos total folks. *They also have party platters for larger groups.   Staff was on point; proper organization and communication both in the front and the back.   As for the food.. The chicken strips are marinated for '24' hours and are not frozen.. so there's none of that freezer burn lingering. They're then breaded and cooked to order.  As far as taste goes, you can tell the chicken tenderloins used are of a much higher quality than that of your typical fast food spot. There's a salivating juiciness you get from cooking chicken properly too, and each strip here is cooked accordingly. Generously breaded and lightly seasoned, each bite you get a little crunch followed by the natural flavors and juices from the chicken. Complimenting the chicken strips perfectly,  they provide you with a \"Rasing Cane's\" dipping sauce; Perhaps some honey mustard, ketchup and pepper? I'm guessing what's in it, but it was actually a nice little sauce whipped up that complimented the strips just fine. Nothing was over salted, over cooked nor had an odd taste to it. Good stuff. These things would actually go great with a brewskie!   The prices here are fair and they have good, quality foods. When I'm back in Vegas.. catching a buzz off the strip and am looking for a quick bite, I'll grab some Raising Cane's chicken strips.. no doubt!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I just heard about it maybe a month or so ago and now I am always here! The sweet tea is incredible!! The fried chicken fingers are incredible! The Cane's sauce is incredible! I love this place. The chicken sandwhich is surprising better than you would think it would be. A little messy but delicious."}
{"text":"I love this location! It's in a pretty good spot, right off the 95. It's right next to the In N Out and close to The Best In The West! The menu is small so it's not difficult to pick something quickly! Their chicken is very crispy and great! I love the fries at Canes. They're usually not crispy at all but they somehow make it work! I always get the box combo. You can substitute things that you don't want (like coleslaw) for an extra toast or sauce. Their toast is soo good. It's so soft on the inside and warm with butter. Mmmm. Also their sauce is always the same. I don't know if they make it there, but if they do I'm impressed. Always great service here too."}
{"text":"I will never turn down the opportunity to eat Canes. It's delicious. Go there now. Bring me some. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Really?  Why is this place so popular?  One word \"meh\".   Took much breading on tiny slivers of chicken.  Fries were a hair better than ore Ida fires out of the freezer section of the grocery stores.  The coleslaw was watery, at least the veggies were still crisp.  The toast was a thick cut wonder bread and tastes like it too.  The dipping sauce was pretty good but they didn't have any other sauces.   I generally don't lime chain restaurants and this place reaffirms my reasons why.  Go to BFG's and get much better quality and selection."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Can't  get enough of it. Almost sad to say i ate here 6meals straight. Their special cane sauce is so addictive!!"}
{"text":"This location can get very busy during lunch hours, especially at the drive thru. I've waited 15-20 minutes in the drive thru line in the past, so if you're late for class or work, don't come here if you see a lot of cars lined up thinking it'll go by fast. It probably won't.   Other than that, everything here is amazing and worth waiting on the drive thru line (if you've got the time). I usually get the 3 finger combo or the sandwich. Dip everything in their dipping sauce, trust me.  You can also get a discount if you show your UNLV student ID!"}
{"text":"For a newly opened location, they have a lot to work on already. They seem to be busy pretty much every time I come there, especially the drive thru. But you need to be very specific and DOUBLE CHECK your orders and receipts before you leave. They've gotten my order wrong (4 fingers in a caniac combo?!) and charged me for a whole extra 3 finger combo once. And expect to be here for a while waiting for your food. At least a 15-20 min wait."}
{"text":"Hands down the tastiest, juciest chicken tender ive ever eaten. My favorite fast food restaurant in the world.  Chicken strips are fresh and always 100% delicious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Its the little things that make me smile... like the crushed ice instead of cubed and the crinkle cut fries.Canes special sauce is Orgasmic over everything.  last time i visited Vegas, my bf and i ate Cane's 3 days in a row before we drove back to san francisco...its THAT good"}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers, you guys were right about this place! I used my Yelp app to locate chicken fingers. Brought me on over to Raising Cane's!  I now understand why everyone talks about having to make a stop here. Amazing and crispy chicken fingers.  Prices are amazing and the dipping sauce is delish!   Do yourself a favor and order more than 3 pieces. You are going to go back and order more so just order 8 and you should be alright! :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I go to Canes pretty often, and this is our most common location. Every employee I've ever spoken with has had a big smile on their face and loved their job; and you can see it in their work ethic. Canes always provides the best customer service, best food, and just overall the best experience. I recently signed up for the Caniac card there, and we did have a little bit of confusion but it was easily settled. Honestly, the membership really doesn't do all that much besides enter you into contests. But there's no harm in getting it! Always get butter on both sides of the bread- it makes it so much better!"}
{"text":"I'm from New Orleans....so expect me to be a bit partial since this place originated in Baton Rouge, LA.  I was so psyched to find out two locations are now in Phoenix!  Come here for:  *   Amazing sweet tea  *   Crispy, buttery texas toast  *   Perfect Chicken fingers (never dry or greasy)  *   The most awesome creamy peppery sauce that I could drink out of a cup   That's it!  They don't do much, but what they do is fabulous.  The only downside to me is the fries.  Way too plain, reminds me of school cafeteria stock.   Double up on the toast!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times, both for eat-in, drive-thru, and for 'tailgate' pick-ups. I have not had bad service.  The best part is that they open at 9 AM, so you have chicken fingers for breakfast.   Two people can definitely share the Caniac, which is $9 and comes w/ 6 pieces of chicken. I always trade out my coleslaw for another piece of Texas toast.   For drinks, they make great sweet tea, but their lemonade is what I prefer. It is not unlimited refills for that though. Boooooo! Nonetheless, the chicken is delicious & this is a great option for lunch."}
{"text":"I love canes so much. Their sauce is amazing! They have the best bread too. I usually like only crispy fries but I'm okay with theirs! Everything I cheap and really filling too. I always get great device here!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday because it was close to where my daughter's soccer tourney was. A menu of nothing but chicken fingers sounds pretty simple right? It is, until you have a giant menu full of chicken finger combos with different amounts of fingers to choose from. Luckily, a young man by the name of Johnny must've noticed the deer in the headlights look we had when staring at the menu, and he pretty much broke it down \"Barney style\" a la \"Ordering Chicken Fingers for Dummies\" and helped us survive the whole ordering process. LOL. For that, I am grateful, because Johnny's customer service skills were on point, and for that reason alone, I'd come back to this location should I be in the area next time I'm in town.  So the chicken fingers on this particular day were perfectly breaded and didn't need any seasoning, especially when paired with their \"Cane Sauce\". Not sure if they're all the same or if there's different, but ours were white meat (chicken tenderloin). Chicken was moist and not dry at all. The crinkle cut fries weren't anything special in the sense that they did something different to them to give them some kind of OMG wow factor, but they were crispy and perfectly salted. Garlic bread wasn't very garlicky, but not too shabby either. My favorite side was the coleslaw, which pushed the limits on the amount of mayo in it without overpowering it.    The four of us decided on sharing our combos, so we got The Box Combo, which is 4 chicken strips, texas toast, coleslaw, fries and a drink, and The Caniac combo which is six strips and it wasn't enough food for a growing boy, a soccer player and a daddy with a bigger appetite. If you don't eat like a bird, I'd recommend getting The Caniac on your own."}
{"text":"My first time trying raising cane's and I wasn't disappointed.  We ordered the big box which had four strips of chicken, fries, coleslaw, and Texas toast.   We had sweet tea as our beverage.  The chicken was moist and tasty."}
{"text":"We love this place. Food is always fresh & the employees are friendly. The restaurant services chicken strips, as the name implies. If you're looking for other fare, you're at the wrong place."}
{"text":"What's so special about this place? The sauce is okay, but Chick-fil-a has more choices of chicken and sauces. The \"texas toast\" I got was not even toasted."}
{"text":"Arrived late night into Vegas, stopped here and overall really amazing fast food place! Food was freshly made and delicious, service amazing...everyone was friendly and in good spirits and restaurant was spotless. Only issue no salad options but otherwise top notch."}
{"text":"The best chicken strips and fries I ever had. Chicken was so moist and tender and the fries, oh the fries were perfect. The staff was very friendly acknowledged as soon as we walked in the door. Our food came out in less than 10 minutes and was very hot and fresh. This is a must try if you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love this canes its on the way home from work, I never have no problems with my orders and everyone is real sweet.."}
{"text":"I've always passed by this fast food restuarant everytime i went for fueling or heading out to walmart or frys. after seeing their commercials, i've decided to give them a try; and i have to say, their chicken fingers are delicious. Always fresh, crispy and tender. The Chicken Box combo was right-on. It had fresh chicken fingers, freshly toasted buttered bread, cole slaw and fries. This is my second time coming here in a week but i will try to limit my visits to once/month (i'll try :( .... )"}
{"text":"Horrible! I eat Canes at least once a week this is the worst one. The fries were old hard and cold, the chicken was cold also. There's one closer to my house so I'll stick with that one. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"I am very upset with my visit to this location for some reason I was served cole slaw with my sandwich combo and I didn't ask for it I didn't have time to ask for this to be fixed due to the fact that I had to run from one job to another I work close to this location and I am upset this happened I will not be visiting this location again"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin! being in broke college student this is one of the best fast food places I've ever had the fried chicken is great the Texas toast is amazing french fries are good cold slaw is also very excellent. But when it comes down to it nothing beats the cane sauce!"}
{"text":"Fat ass, fresh ass fingers, sauce kick's ass. Super good. very clean place. That's all 4 now."}
{"text":"Customer service here is not acceptable. Their credit card machines don't work after I tried 2 different cards so they only accepted cash. Drive thru attendant lady was very rude and wouldn't even try to charge the card a second time. Straight up turning customers away. Not coming back to this location due to poor customer service.   Ended up at the in n out next door and had no issues"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite go to place for some fast food whenever I'm in Vegas! The chicken is done perfectly and seems very fresh. The crinkle fries bring me back to my childhood days which is always a great feeling. The special sauce for the chicken is perfected. But the best thing here has to be the bread!!! That bread is to die for. No joke."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious and well prepared, however, I found a piece of plastic in my coleslaw. I've ordered from this place several times and it has always been such a treat. The workers are pretty chill. It's just sad that my coleslaw had the plastic bit in it. The plastic was the same material as a plastic spoon and it was about an inch long. It was a blue color and blended into the cole slaw very well. It was a bit pointy, though. Good thing I didn't pierce my tongue with it."}
{"text":"Caniac combo.  Drool!    6 chicken fingers in their famous sauce along with fries and coleslaw and drink.    There's a reason why this place is always open and that's because of it's deliciousness.   Try mixing the cane's sauce with the hot sauce.    And if you're not big on coleslaw, substitute it for more fries."}
{"text":"Food descent.. lemonade watered down to the max! Doesn't even taste like lemonade, taste like tap water with sugar . Won't return to that location"}
{"text":"not the best location. the food used to be made to order..... but the last 4-5times i went i had cold chicken and fries. what happened?? i live 3 blocks away and took caines off my weekly rotation for this reason. i do however go at 10-11pm at night. chicken and fries sitting in warmers so staff can clean before closing? unacceptable!  i will try them again during lunch and will let u know"}
{"text":"I have gone out of my way to eat here, and I don't live in the same town!  The chicken fingers are filling and delicious. The toast is perfect and fries just compliment anything you eat here. The dipping sauce makes the chicken all the rage!  I cannot wait for a new Raising Cane's to be opened in my town of Casa Grande!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't get my order right. Crinkle cut fries and a toast... Woman at the drive window was not friendly and didn't check to assure orders were correct."}
{"text":"They've forgot specific things in my order but I'm willing to overlook it because this place is delicious so happy they opened a location in Gilbert, this place is the bees knees"}
{"text":"The best little chicken finger place in Las Vegas? It's Raising Cane's chicken fingers. They only have one thing on the menu but its way worth a try! When first trying Cane's I was a little skeptical of the fact they didn't have anything else on the menu except fingers and fries and the fact they didn't have ranch dipping sauce. However after trying their signature Caniac meal I knew why they only had one thing on the menu, because you wouldn't want to order anything else anyway! The Caniac comes with 6 chicken fingers, french fries, grilled texas toast bread, and Cane's special sauce. The Cane's sauce is hands down the best dipping sauce I have ever had and the Caniac is more than enough to fill me up and I can eat! If you are in Vegas and are having chick-fil-a withdrawals, unfortunately Vegas has yet to embrace the king of chicken, Raising Cane's is a quite capable replacement and you might head home wishing that there was a raising Cane's in your hometown instead!"}
{"text":"This is the place for a quick fix on a chicken addiction! Split the caniac box with someone you love today. Quick, tasty, simple, and easy. Yum."}
{"text":"I absolutely love raising canes every time I come to Vegas I always stop by. If you're in the mood for fast food please don't go to McDonald's. Get you some Raising Cane, with the extra sauce, and some of that homemade squeezed lemonade it's delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Cane's experience ever. The restaurant is filthy and no empty tables are clean. One employee who is delivering orders keeps loudly repeating one line from some song and dabbing. How about cleaning a table? The ceiling fans are on full speed so the only comfortable place to sit is the booths along the walls. Could you clean one for me? One star because the chicken doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Ate here for the 1st time, as we don't have them in the midwest.  It was Great!  Loved the chicken fingers and sauce!!  2 thumbs up!!  Wish we had some in Nebraska & Missouri!"}
{"text":"If you like simple, Raising Cane's is the place to go.  All they serve is chicken strips so do not come here if you are thinking you can get an alternative because you cannot.  I love the flavor of the chicken and I love the crinkle cut fries!  The toast is really good and the Cane's sauce is some of the best I have had!"}
{"text":"Beyond delicious!!!! The poultry was super tender, and fried to perfection. Pricing was on point and very fair, and arguably better quality than any sit down restaurant in Phoenix!   Also, service is super super fast, and the manger even popped out to say hello, even though they were swamped!   You have to go here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite fast food places. Cane's started in Louisiana and they were everywhere in New Orleans. It is nice to see more popping up in the valley. They only focus on chicken and they know how to do chicken right. Sweet Tea is great! My personal favorite is the #1 no coleslaw extra toast, but you cant go wrong with anything on the menu. It is a little more expensive than some of the other fast food places, but the quality of food is worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always come to this location! Friendly staff! They are usually busy because of the university, but service is still speedy! The inside dining is kept clean always, they usually have a associate in the dining room specifically.  Our fav is the 3 finger combo! The 6 finger combo is honestly huge lol, we bought it once when we were \"starving\" omg so filling lol.   The cane sauce- OOMMMGGG  to die for! I recently moved from California and had never heard of this place and now I love it!"}
{"text":"I love their sauce and toast! I always get them with the sandwich combo (without fries) and extra toast and sauce."}
{"text":"Finally a Raising Cane's near the house!  I've had their chicken before, but never had the chance to go into one of their restaurants, order, and eat there.  I loved the chicken when someone brought it to me, and it was even better hot and fresh.  Here's why I like Raising Cane's:  the chicken takes like lightly-breaded and seasoned chicken, rather than lots of heavy breading and seasoning masking the chicken.  If I want bread and seasoning, I'll buy croutons.  When I want well-prepared chicken strips, I'll buy Cane's.  The sauce:  nothing to rave about but it's very tasty and still mild enough that it doesn't bury the fresh and hot flavor of the chicken.  The slaw is also delicious, and they give you just enough that it satisfies (and might leave you wanting just a little more.  What's also nice is the ample fries (more than I could, or should eat).  They're not the best fries you can find, but they're as hot and fresh as the chicken.  A nice side that doesn't steal your attention from the chicken strips.  And the Texas Toast.  It's good, but doesn't do much for me.  I don't care though because I'm not there for the toast.  (See the earlier crouton comment.)  It's a nice complement to the meal though.  Not sure what else to tell you other than if you're a fan of chicken strips and haven't tried Raising Cane's, give it a shot.  This is my new favorite place to go for chicken strips."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great service and excellent food. I only wish they had more side orders."}
{"text":"For a place that only sells chicken and has a very small menu and ALWAYS busy with a long drive-thru that blocks part of the cars parked, it is the best Raising Cane's we've visited in Arizona.  The chicken is never dry and the flavor is consistent.  Their staff is respectful, in a good mood and somewhat quiet when they need to be.  The one thing that stood out on our first visit at this location was how well the staff works with each other.  The staff taking the orders is ALWAYS helpful and they are flexible when ordering large orders.  Half and half of this or that.  The drive-thru line moves very quickly and we never wait long for our food.  Two days ago when we were dining in with my family in the evening the Manager was walking around the restaurant clearing things up all around the areas and stopped by every table to check in on his customers.  Which is probably why the restaurant stays clean with all their traffic.  When he came to our table he asked if everything was okay, we said, yes thank you and then asked if we needed anything else... more dipping sauces?  We normally do need more sauces but these places charge extra for their sauces so we were surprised by the question at first.  The only thing that's tricky about this restaurant is their location and the front door placement. Since most customers park on the side (by the drive-thru line) or in the back we enter and exit from the back door.  The problem is that since most college students in the area come in large groups they block part of the areas between tables so SOMETIMES it can feel like an obstacle course to get to the front to place an order but not as bad as you think.  Nothing that would keep me from coming back though.  There's are four other Raising Cane's closer to us than this location but we LOVE their food and their service.  We've also visited the location in Flagstaff (another college town) and it's the only other good Cane's in AZ. This one in Tempe just seems to have a lot more younger ladies coming in with clothes that leave little to the imagination, those poor girls.   haha"}
{"text":"There chicken is dry and flavorless, special ranch sauce is bland. Only thing I really enjoyed was the bread."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is a fast-food restaurant chain known for its chicken fingers, and it has some of the best darn chicken fingers that I have ever tried!  Do yourself a favor and order 'The Box Combo' or 'The 3 Finger Combo'. The perfect box comes with Texas toast, coleslaw, crinkle-cut fries, Cane's sauce and premium chicken tenderloins. The Texas toast is \"a thick-sliced sesame seeded bun brushed with real butter and garlic salt, grilled on a flat top\". The Cane's Sauce is flavorful and is de-freaking-licious; \"it is tangy with a little bit of spice\". You can dip your chicken tenders, fries or toast into this  sauce for added flavor.  Since there are no locations near my home, I try to stop by Raising Cane's during my trips to Vegas. Granted, these chicken finger boxes won't fill you up like those Vegas buffets, but they are perfect for lunch or to snack on in-between meals. Also, thanks to this location's drive-thru option, Raising Cane's is a definitely a quick and easy choice for food!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, the kid at the drive thru asked if he had pimples on his face. Great way to talk to a customer while working at fast food. Extremely disgusting and rude. Food is sometimes fresh. Used to be my favorite place to go but lately they have been horrible. They lost my canes card through the drive thru. I don't know how that happens but it did and now I have to start over on my rewards. Originally gave this a 2 Star but after thinking about it, they deserve a 1"}
{"text":"If I had a toss up between choosing Raising Cane's and Chick Fil A...after this visit, I would still flip a coin.    The legions of customer's at Raising Cane's may disagree. Busy!    The chicken fingers, sandwich, and sauce were all yummy...but fried food is not a consistent craving for me. Did I mention it was busy, like good luck on finding a table.  However, good enough to return."}
{"text":"seating is scarce but just because food is so yummmmmm. Always enjoy cains but will take one star because the drink lids are so flimsy.. 3 drinks spilled while we were eating and the soda area was a little messy prob from more spilt beverages.. but aside from that I love cains!!! just be careful with your drink"}
{"text":"Sometimes the size of the chicken strips is a bit suspect in the box meals. If you want the most bang for your buck order the sandwich with an extra side of Texas toast."}
{"text":"Literally right across the street from my house, was told by so many people this is the best fast food franchise after in and out so had to give it a try! Been there twice 100% satisfied! Service was good food was amazing! I ordered the Caniac (6 pieces of fried chicken fingers with fries, bread) chickens really tender and crispy outside it was very fresh(?) I always see the place is packed with people and cars for drive through"}
{"text":"I  am really sad to have to write this review.  Six months ago I would have given them 5 stars and raved about the food but over the last few months something has changed here.  I don't know if management has changed or who orders the food but we were disappointed in early February by the skimpy chicken, the limp fries and loss of flavor in the coleslaw.  Could have been a bad day, right?  So we went back a couple of weeks ago.  Same thing.  The size of the chicken fingers has drastically been reduced and even the bread is lacking.  It was \"shrunken\" and limp.  I really hope Raising Cane's will come back to the food we were raving about six months ago."}
{"text":"I brought my husband here last night for the first time to show him how good the food was and they completely forgot to put half of the order in the bag. Terrible impression that was! Your food might be good but your customer service is terrible."}
{"text":"A good place to get a chicken sandwich. I wish they had more menu options. I would come more often if they had a better drive thru; it blocks the parking area."}
{"text":"Chicken is great but who eats chicken strips without ranch? Seriously canes, put ranch on the menu."}
{"text":"Raising Canes is an establishment that always makes you feel like family and the food is always on point. This visit in Vegas was no different and even exceeded expectations. Brandon the manager took care of my group and made sure we had a great experience, food was top flight as always, and truly saved us after a long day at the vegas pools! Appreciate the hospitality!!"}
{"text":"I think it's pretty sad that you have to charge guests for extra sauce. I probably will never come here again."}
{"text":"Came with a group of 5 yesterday and customer service is awesome but one of our orders took like 15 minutes before we got it. Met the legend manager Mac (sp?) who made sure we got what we needed and it also help jog Vic's memory LOL"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast! Good chicken fingers! Good fries and very good canes sauce!"}
{"text":"I'm from California and every time I come to Vegas I need to get me some Canes no other chicken fingers compare with Canes! And you can't forget to get their famous sweet tea! God I'm craving it right now!"}
{"text":"From 4/30/15 This place was interesting for a fast food joint that serves mostly chicken.  By interesting I mean it was actually clean, decorated nicely, and did not have a film of grease on it like most chicken places do. I got the 3 Finger chicken strip meal, which comes with fries, Texas Toast, a drink, and Cane's sauce. Everything was tasty, I didn't eat the Texas toast though; felt it was overkill considering the amount of fries they give you. I'm impressed with this place, and will definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"I have never been to a raising canes until about 3 months ago, I ordered a cainiac and loved the chicken strips and quality and size of them. The bread and cane sauce if absolutely awesome. The fries where just average and cole slaw  below average but hey wasn't really coming here for the cole slaw . Try sweet tea with lemonade makes a great Arnold Palmer . The service was fast but  today was missing 2 strips in one of our meals. Left a message and see how follow up goes tomarrow. Also seemed strange ordered same exact order all 3 times but total price was different all 3 times only by few cents but still odd. This place is always busy when I drive by so I must not be only one that agrees this is some tasty food . Always check your order again I ordered 2 6 piece caniacs and one had 7 pieces and the other 4 I can see how 4 and 6 pieces get mixed up and they fixed it allowing me to keep 1 extra . Still awesome chicken !"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken & great customer service. Reminds me of Zaxbys chicken....  Came around midnight, it was a little wait but so worth it!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time. And not only the food is dope. But the young lady name shanalle was beyond amazing. 1 she made us feel like we was at home. She needs a raise cause they way she made me feel was sooooo good. Sending all love to her"}
{"text":"AWESOME. ...my family favorite place!  Service could be better but food is always consistent."}
{"text":"1st time eating at a Raising Canes and it was surprisingly really good for a fast food quick stop! The white meat chicken strips were very tasty and not greasy! Making them worth the stop this time and more times to come. The fries were good with the strips and the Texas toast was crispy on the side and soft in the inside! The cane sauce is delicouse and I used it on my fries too! The sweet tea is delicouse! Awesome customer service! And very clean all around!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars   Gotta say, I'm enjoying these fast food restaurants that spotlight chicken rather than beef burgers.   Two of us shared the Caniac Combo, which was more than enough food with 6 crunchy chicken strips, crinkle-cut fries, & Texas toast (which is more plain than some reviews will have you believe, unfortunately.) Cane's dipping sauce is like a zesty thousand island dressing, but spiced differently...cajun, perhaps? Under $10 for this meal, which included a yummy, addictive sweet tea.   Would consider paying them a second visit on my way out of town, as Cane's is en route to LAS."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure their chicken is made with crack. I mean why else would I be coming here every single week?!?! That and their wonderful customer service! One time I came in with my two kids, one being a toddler who I had to hold the whole time with picking up, and they offered to help me out to the car. Thanks Cane's for always having fresh and delicious food and being so courteous!"}
{"text":"Chicken was delicious and fries hit the spot! The chicken was not dry and was hot and fresh! This was a good choice ... I wish they had more sauces to compliment the chicken such as gravy or hot sauce.i would definitely come back ... Tea was delicious too."}
{"text":"I'm from California i come here every time, whenever I go to vegas.   Their chicken strips are delicious, it is soft and tender. Also, their toast are really good with their special sauce. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Wow ! Why didn't my family and I come here sooner ?!? Better then expected, chicken non greasy and great prices. We'll definitely be back !"}
{"text":"I don't get it. Everyone I know, & I mean everyone, loves this place. But I just don't get it. Their coleslaw is watery, the fries are so so, and the fried chicken fingers are just that. Fried chicken fingers. Nothing special about them. The only time I eat here is when I am in a group of people and everyone wants to go and I don't want to be that one person that says no lol."}
{"text":"Service was fast and the food tasted great just like it does back in my hometown of Louisville Kentucky. If you like chicken this is the place to go! Far Better than KFC and Chick-fil-A"}
{"text":"Typically, if I stop at Cane's, it is the UNLV location, which is always busy!  However, this location is near my office building, so today when I was looking for a quick lunch, it won -- or rather, I won!  Cane's has mastered the \"do one thing and do it well\" business model.  They have chicken strips and fries.  They are tasty.  No complaints.  The food is always hot and fresh and reasonably priced.  However, the difference between a good location and a great location is the service.    The UNLV location is always so busy; the staff is always friendly, but hurried.  Here, they were a bit less busy and went out of their way to be friendly.  The cashier asked me about my day; the staff member cleaning the lobby held the door for me when I came in.  These extra touches really help a quick-service restaurant stand out.  I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Drive thru order. It was fast and great service.  Sweet tea is really good not so sweet or bland  it was just perfect. Will get some to go before we leave las vegas. Food was really good chicken tenders were a good size and not dry at all. Fries are fries they should have specialty fries like garlic butter, seasoned ones, you get my idea. The price between serving quantities is not much off a difference from the price. I recommend getting the 6 pcs roughly  $8 and change with fries and 32oz soda dipping sauce (to die for) coleslaw and a good size butter toast (Really good and soft) Other then that it a great place."}
{"text":"Canes is my absolutely favorite place to go when I want chicken tenders. This used to be my favorite location. However, since they hired their new employees their service isn't quite as great as it used to be. They are continuously messing up everyone's orders, and I usually hear them yelling at each other through the drive thru window. I think I will be taking the drive to another location for now on."}
{"text":"I love chicken strips, especially from canes, especially with their canes special sauce. You can't get fresh chicken strips with good sauce and a cup of lemonade anywhere else.  The price is a bit high, but they have great service, great food, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you love chicken fingers I kid you not if you are ever in Vegas and you are a hater of Chick fil-a people because they use peanut oil, then this is your dream come true. Due to cross contamination with shellfish and peanuts there are many places I can't eat that fry food. The Rebel kids swore I would love this place and they did not use peanut oil. They were so freakin right I love this place, I need to call their HQ and ask them to come to the Bay."}
{"text":"Okay I cannot brag enough about this place and I have wrote to headquarters to beg them to open a store over here in the East Bay. One of the things I love the most about Raising Cane's is that I can eat it LOL. They do not use peanut oil and they don't make the menu some huge fanfare they keep it simple. They have the best chicken fingers around and I cannot not stress that if there is one place to visit this is the place to visit in Vegas. I look forward to my trips because I know I will be getting some Cane's. Not only is  the food consistent in all their restaurants but the price is so cheap. If you look at the pic you would see how much food you get and in the Bay it would cost more to go to McDonald's then to go the Cane's. I love the atmosphere, you can't beat having a disco ball on the ceiling right? They show support to our Rebels at UNLV by offering literally starving student discounts.  When you order your food they bring it to your table and they also help clean up your food. Now that is some superior service for a fast food joint right? The restroom are very clean too which I totally appreciate. The tables and floors are constantly being cleaned which I love too. So if you make it out to Vegas just like the M&M store and Coke Store put this on the list of places to visit. You will not regret it, and if you have kids or a big family you really won't regret it because you can't beat the quality of food or the price. :}"}
{"text":"First time here. Heard the buzz and wanted to check out the hype. The Caniac Combo was more than fulfilling for the bf and I. Their sauce was good too. Can't complain about anything really, sweet tea was on point and their chicken fingers were off the hook! Toast was perfectly toasted and the center was soft, must try! Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I LOVE this place!  The chicken is not as good as other 'chicken only' restaurants but the sauce is amazing, we always get extra.  The large 'box' meal is enough for the two of us to share, we always order extra toast instead of coleslaw because the toast is great as well. The entire team at this restaurant acts like they are paid 50k a year, the service is wonderful and they are always friendly and seem happy to be there taking care of customers.   A tip is you can order the meal without the drink and they subtract the price of the drink, we drive through and eat at home most times so this is a nice way to save a little money."}
{"text":"This chain has always been a good to spot for my family and I to eat without spending too much. The experience has been bad over the years with the quality of the food.   Reason for one star: -The size has gone from normal chicken finger size to itty-bitty chicken fingers. I'm sure many people who have been going to Raising Cane's can agree.  -Multiple locations we've found hair inside the chicken..GROSS!! There's other reviews that says the same. I have not once seen the workers wear hair nets. -As well as the temperature of our food, I wouldn't say our food would be cold but it wouldn't be a warm temperature to even eat.   - LINES FOR DAYS! Please be warned if you're dinning in, make sure you're no where parked by the entrance. The line will box you in and you will have a hard time backing out."}
{"text":"Very fast, fast food - very hot, juicy chicken fingers. Nothing fancy, to me - just chicken fingers with a kind of thick batter. Even if you order the sandwich it's just three chicken fingers on a bun with a lot of their sauce and one piece of lettuce. A good grab for drive through to fill your tummy but nothing fancy at all what-so-ever."}
{"text":"This location is great! It's always busy and the food is always hot and fresh.   The chicken tenders are delicious and the garlic bread is crave-able!"}
{"text":"YOU WILL NEVER KNOW WHAT REAL CHCIKEN FINGERS ARE UNTIL YOU GO HERE!  They cook their chicken from scratch meaning its not frozen! You might say all these guys do is chicken fingers. Well, they do have a chicken sandwich! Bottom line is that their menu is simple and that's why they do it so well!  For you first timers the Box Combo is the perfect choice. You get 4 chicken fingers, texas toast, cole slaw, fries, and a regular drink.  Important things you need to  know: Each combo comes with at least one \"special Cane's sauce\" that goes good with everything! Well, maybe not the cole slaw but if that floats your boat, then go for it!. Also, if you don't like the cole slaw, you can trade it in for extra fries or extra bread at no additional charge! How awesome is that? You can also request for them to toast both sides of the bread for more flavor! You can ask for hot sauce and they will give you packets of Louisiana hot sauce. And last but not least, their sweet tea is one of the best I have had in a while. Oh, and make sure you sign up for the Cane's card. Its free and you get cool stuff like free food and discounts.   I have yet to have bad service at any of their locations! Bathrooms are spacious and kept very clean.   For more info you can check out their website: www.raisingcanes.com"}
{"text":"Great food as always but dang dump the techno club music"}
{"text":"The restaurant was crazy busy on my visit. However the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. I did a large last minute order without calling a head. The cashier  (younger girl with long blonde hair, wish I knew her name) smiled tried to save me a few dollars and suggested a cheaper way. She then saw my 2 year old daughter standing there. She gave my daughter a drink no charge to me. The Manger  (erica) checked my order making sure it was right. She had someone help me get 16 drinks and 16 boxes to my car. All had smiles. I will absolutely be going back. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Just thinking about this place makes me drool....somebody hand me a napkin.  They only serve one thing, so if you aren't in the mood for chicken fingers and fries....go elsewhere!  They have a drive-thru window and also a dining area inside.  Clean, casual, excellent food.  Their fries could use a little seasoning but the juicy chicken tenders and their special sauce are AWESOME!!  Special sauce is creamy, looks similar to thousand island but with a little kick to it.  Gotta love this place!  I brought my mom here when she visited from out of state, and she is dying to come back to visit just so she can munch on some more chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Small, dry tenders that were missing lots of breading. Soggy crinkle fries and soggy Texas toast. Like the whole thing was under a mister... And only two sauces is really not enough and they were only 3/4 of the way full. Diet Coke tastes a little watered down. Would not patron again."}
{"text":"My first visit was opening week, and yes I realize that was years ago.  My buddy loves this place and wanted to treat me to lunch. It was a solid choice and my buddy's reward card got him a generous discount on todays visit.  The parking lot and lobby were packed but at the counter service was cool and efficient. and a look through the expo window I noticed that carried through to the kitchen.  I wiped our table down but the lobby attendant was present and busy.   Then there it was a friendly server calling our name (both Jim's). the 5 piece combo with slaw strips, texas toast and fries were delivered fast and hot. The slaw was Ice cold. No choice on sauce but the house sauce was great, kinda ranchy but different. The chicken was perfect and the best strips I have had in a very very long time!  the menu is tight and that might be why they are so efficient, you cant complain about that."}
{"text":"My bf was talking this place up so much, just had to try it. And I totally see why! The food is delicious!  At first I was expecting something along the lines of KFC. But this was WAY better. Their special sauce, which seems like mayo + ketchup + pepper, doesnt taste like much on its own, but with the chicken, omg Im drooling just thinking about it. The chicken is nicely breaded without being too thick or greasy, the krinkle cut fries arent greasy either and have a nice crunch, the toast is thick and fluffy and nicely flavored without being greasy either. You might be able to tell Im surprised by the lack of grease.   Other than the food, the place was a little messy, but it was pretty busy and they seemed short staffed. But totally willing to overlook that with their awesome food! Cant wait to go back the next time Im in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love that I can order honey mustard bc Cane's sauce is overrated.    The chicken is amazing though.  I am not a fan of chicken fingers usually but when I'm in this area I'm always happy to stop in.  Juicy, fresh chicken with delicious coleslaw, toast & fries this place is great."}
{"text":"They do have some good chicken fingers but other than that they are over-rated and over priced.  Their lemonade is excellent but they charge for refills.  Cane sauce was good.  Overall, I will not be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Service is always on point, food is hot and served fast, facilities are clean, and their order consistency is amazing. I will always recommend to order the toast with \"butter on both sides\" and the fries \"extra crispy\". The sweet tea is downright addictive; the lemonade is fantastic as well, but not worth the extra thirty cent charge and charges for refills."}
{"text":"Okay, so my first thought was dang this place is arrogant. Only offering their sauce, no bbq, no ranch, etc. After a few bites I was floored. This place is epic! The chicken was amazing, the sauce with the chicken is unbelievable, the service was awesome. I will definitely be back, too bad its such a drive for me :/"}
{"text":"dieci stelle.  Black Folks loves some Chicken Pollo....  I had just bought some Cowboy boots. Look for the Las Vegas Yelps.  I have  list.  To raise Cain:         to cause a great disturbance; to make great trouble.  Ah this Las Vegas Eatery.... is Calming....  like eating some of Mom's Southern Cooking.....    I was in the parking lot over...I bought some stivale/boots heche in Mexico.. in need of sustenance. Ho visto A drive thru..  Well  the wait was incredible.... I had only two which I devoured. I needed something inmy tummy...to fortifiy myself for ..to live.    I see like the cross on the hill....Raising Cane. Named after Cane Corso  omg it is an Italian Guard Dog...  Cane Corso is the breed also  Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers is a chain of fast-food restaurants founded by Todd Graves and Craig Silvey on August 26, 1996. The restaurant chain offers fried chicken fingers as its only main course (hence their mantra of \"One Love\").  The Chicken is marinated overnight and then battered and fried...They must do it with care cuz ...they were alittle slow.    I told Justin M...a very long Italian name...similar to Manacotti He is the Vice -President...  of something..  He gave me his card...  I just got back to SF. I cannot locate the card. but fear not...  Thank Yelp for the Review \"Edit\" button.  I ate the two and then drove back and parked...  I could not deal with Drive-Thru.  I ordered did not have enough money and had to go back to my rental and get my real wallet.. I order 6..... and eating is good in the Neiborhood.  Infodiva here....  Buon Anno 2008 rocks... I can't wait to see the nutrional info...  A girl has to watch her figure you know.  The coleslaw was bland. You need my mother's Coleslaw Recipies (Plural) She also substitutes some of the mayo with non-fat yougurt um um um.  I want some chicknen now! Cane...mio perro...  Ho cercato te piu tarde."}
{"text":"It's no Chick-Fil-A i'm just sayin'. This place has chicken strips that are over coated with batter .. I ordered a chicken sandwich hoping for a piece of chicken with lettuce, tomato etc. and I got a huge bun with a couple chicken fingers on it. I can live w/out this place for sure."}
{"text":"I don't know why people would even go back. I am sorry but the chicken is so small and the breading is so large :( it's truly a healthy person's nightmare. I feel bad giving a bad review the place was clean, well lit, and the food was hot and the service was great. It's just the food, is so bad for you. I can't ever go there again, thanks."}
{"text":"Just not a fan. Real clean place, real nice people working here. I am just not into the chicken fingers thing. Even if you order a sandwich, it's a burger bun with three chicken fingers on it. The chicken is fresh, hot, and good I just don't like it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!   Honestly had high hopes for this place, but although the chicken was moist, flaky and perfectly crisp, it's honestly not worth going out of your way for.   I also love their soft drinks! not a lot of food places serve crushed ice, but this place sure does, and I LOVE THAT!   I ordered their 6 pc. chicken. the sauce was good, the bread was not all that! the middle of the bread needed more garlic sauce or something!!   The fries....well let's just say ore ida taste's much better."}
{"text":"Love Raising Canes! Best part about Chick Fil A opening in Vegas is hopefully the lines at Canes will be shorter. I can't imagine what life was like before Canes sauce anymore. I even dip the toast in it."}
{"text":"Best canes around. Not much to say other then that. They always get the order correct and its always delicious. The sauce is the best thing here. Love me some canes.  Try this place you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The best chicken strips (more like thick chicken breast tenders) out there. They're tender and juicy with a crispy coating. The fries are a perfect complement and the Texas toast is oh so bad it's good. The Texas toast is a thick piece of buttered bread that is grilled with crispy edges, definitely not good for those counting calories but an excellent choice for us carboholics. Everything is made to order and comes out piping hot. Their coleslaw helps balance out all the fried goodness. It's a little bland but has a good crunch to it.  I love getting the kids meal for a cheap snack on the go. Their lemonade has the perfect balance between tart and sweet but ask for less ice otherwise you'll get a cupful of ice with a few gulps of lemonade. Fresh ingredients equals great tasting food. Every Cane's I've been to has had a line inside and out but they're always quick to get your order out. Service with a smile as well."}
{"text":"We came to Canes for lunch and boy not only was the food good bit shop was the service! The staff were polite and fast. Our names were called and our food was brought to us.  The staff checked on the wants and needs of everybody with a smile! The food came out fast and tasty! I had the box combo which left me full and with left overs. The staff immediately would clean up right after patrons leave the table.  Raising Canes rocks!"}
{"text":"My buddies were raving about trying this place when I went to Vegas. The first few times I'd see it but would never pull in. Finally I got a chance to go and see what the hype was about. The food was definitely something worth trying. They are know for their chicken strips and the sauce it comes with was addicting. I was a bit hungover eating here but managed to really enjoy it."}
{"text":"My hubby and I were craving some chicken on our way out of the Vegas Strip and I found Raising Cane's on Yelp! We ordered the Caniac Combo, which in my option was so cheap for the amount you get compared to what we pay at Chik Fil-A in California. The chicken quality was great, it came with more fries than we could finish, and the Texas toast was yummy! It also came with two cups of their special sauce, which I expected to be amazing since you have to normally pay per cup on the menu. I'm probably one of the few to say it, but I didn't like it at all after one taste :/ It kinda had a weird sour taste to it. However, I'm sure everyone who grew up eating Raising Cane's would disagree haha. Otherwise, customer service was great, the restaurant was clean, and we enjoyed our meal!"}
{"text":"My brother comes to this location every week on his day off, I finally had him get me 2 chicken sandwiches from here and man (might) be the best chicken sandwich I've had in a longtime..... not gonna lie been thinking about another all week"}
{"text":"My kids have some type of passionate love for this place.   As an adult, I don't get it. Over priced chicken strips. It's always completely packed the drive through is always 10 deep. People love this place, I don't. To pricey to take a family of 4.....for chicken strips and fries."}
{"text":"I came here because a bunch of my friends who hail from Austin had nothing but good things to say about this place. In fact, they told me that I should divert from BBQ in order to have a meal that was Raising Cane's. I can no longer trust a damn word out of those filthy liars' mouths.  If I was say, 20, and I had developed no culinary tastes, I can see how this place would appeal to someone. It's like, getting the golden platter at a diner: Fried chicken, fries, fried toast, and a soda.  Unfortunately, the fried chicken is REALLY hit and miss (some of the pieces I got were extremely dry) the fries are WAY too salty, and what the hell do I need a giant side of carbs for? The bread doesn't pair with anything.  The sauce is ok, it makes the bland chicken fingers so go from \"meh\" to okay, but there's a lot of mayo in there. I'd be much better off with a hot sauce of some kind, and since this is literally the only thing Cane's sells, I have no idea why anyone would come here instead of just going to Popeye's."}
{"text":"I love this place! They are fast even when they are busy (which is all the time). The inside is clean, the employees are friendly and you get a lot of food for a good price. I WISH I knew what was in that secret sauce because I am addicted to it! No one else does Chicken Fingers like this place!"}
{"text":"My husband wanted to try this place because Raising Cane's is one of the sponsors for one of the football podcasts that he listens to. We liked it! the food is made fresh,fast, the people were nice and it is clean. It isn't anything fancy but it was good. They only have ketchup and a secret sauce for the strips, so if you like them w/ ranch or BBQ then you're out of luck. But we liked the fries, chicken and bread!"}
{"text":"Food sucked chicken had no flavor not hot and fresh. The dipping sauce was okay at best fries were cold.  The best thing out of it all was the bread lol.  Will not be back KFC is a lot better."}
{"text":"My very first time at \"Raising Cane's\"  We always eat at In N Out and wondered why they always have a line next door at \"Raising Cane's\" So one day I walked in for lunch and I ordered The Caniac for about 8.50 no drink by request.  I got 8 chicken tenders and a bunch of over cooked crinkle cut fires.  They also included 1 piece of bread buttered with a tiny tub of cole slaw, which wasn't bad.  I don't care too much for their dipping sauce.    The chicken was fine plain.  I was disappointed with the burned fries but what are you gonna do ?  My son said the tenders were average.  No different from Popey's or KFC's tenders except Cane's tenders certainly cost a lot more. With my order, I only received a small bunch of burned fries, 6 med. size tenders, 1 piece of texas toast, and a tiny 3 or 4 tsp of cole slaw.  Shoot me for not mentioning the 2 equal sizes of whatever sauce that I tossed out after smelling them (not spoiled, just not a mayo or may mix sauce guy).   When my son wants chicken fingers, I'm going to the real pros.  And when we go to In n Out I will no longer wonder why everybody is lining up for expensive ass chicken tenders again."}
{"text":"Despite my limitations on eating meat, I had to see what all the hype is about while in Vegas. I was not impressed. At all! The bread was the best part and even that wasn't so great.   Pros Chicken strips were juicy and tender Drive-thru service was quick   Cons Not enough crust on chicken  Flavor was nothing spectacular Fries lacked salt  \"Famous sauce\" was just ehhh.. Lemonade did not taste like it was fresh squeezed  I will not be back."}
{"text":"RC Chicken is the best.  Got here at the wrong moment of the week, Friday night at 6pm, eve of spring training.  The line was a 50 yards long down the block waiting to get in.  It's that good.  Build more stores!  Put some in Utah, and run Zaxbys back home."}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars based on chicken quality my wife would give it 5. I thought it was unusual that the place was packed and drive-thru line a mile long for a place that only sells chicken strips. They were damn good and special sauce was very good but menu is too limited for me to return unless I had to have chicken strips, Aloha"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this location because I'm never in line more than 10min even if it is crowded. The service is always punctual, the food always on point, and the people behind the speaker have the best personalities. They're catchy sayings have me smiling all the way home!"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is legit. I hit up this location at least once a week if not more. I have a problem. I don't know whether it's the Canes sauce or the hot, juciy, plump chicken fingers. Or maybe it's the fresh, crispy fries. Everything is fresh and delicious.   Anyways, I always get the same thing. Caniac combo; no toast extra cole slaw. Instead of 2 Cane's sauces, 1 cane sauce and 1 honey mustard. Canes sauce has a little kick too. And for my drink I get the unsweetened ice tea and put my splendas in. I don't need the extra sugar from the sweetened tea. Trust me, i'm fat.  Most of the cashiers know my order by heart. David is a great worker there. We always have a good conversation about life. Customer service is always A+++ here. Asking if everything is ok, or If I need something. The place is always spotless too. They are always wiping down tables or cleaning the soda fountain and ketchup area."}
{"text":"Great fast food. Definitely tastes fresh and not microwaved. We Love the Texas Toast and the cole slaw that comes with the \"Caniac Combo\". Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My kids and I love this place but after seeing green on the chicken will be the last time we will eat here. Please check the chicken before eating it. I dont know what it is but I ate half of the chicken finger."}
{"text":"I love raising canes the food is absolutely amazing. But this location sucks definitely the worst location in the valley. One day I ordered a chicken sandwich three extra chicken tenders and I like everything crispy, first of all the girl asked me six times if I want it crispy. Then it only took 23 minutes for me to get my food. If I wasn't in such a rush I would've snapped and asked to talk to the manager but I didn't have time. I know I want to my food extra crispy, but 23 minutes that's a bit excessive. Either no it's the most convenient location to my work and house I will still drive the extra 5 miles to go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very tasty place for a quick lunch that's hot and fresh.  They really only serve one main entree; chicken fingers.  They do that really well though.  They are tender, juicy, and the coating is light and crunchy.  The drive-through is efficient even when there's a long line."}
{"text":"Delicious lemonade and reasonably priced! My boyfriend took me here for lunch! The chicken was juicy and delicious! We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Cane's is Cane's but this place is mad busy during lunch... just FYI. Enjoy your feast...Oh and sweet tea."}
{"text":"The caniac is where its at. Their sauce is the best here, plus they have crushed ice in the machines. Who doesn't love crushed ice. This particular location is full of college students. So if your into the hipster, i'm confused about life, struggling college kid scene then this place makes for some good people watching. The staff was great, when a group exited the quickly cleaned up the tables and went back to work. The register people actually asked for my ID which I appreciated. Besides the sauce and great service, they have the best sweet tea around."}
{"text":"So disappointed with this place! If you like bland no taste chicken then this is the place. Quantity for the price doesn't measure up. I got four tiny chicken fingers, a piece of garlic bread that had no garlic taste, fries and cole slaw. The size of the chicken that you see on the menu is not what you get. I would not recommend this place and will not be back."}
{"text":"I LOOOOOOOOOVE chicken strips/fingers/nuggets.  Raising Cane's is quite an experience.  Best fast food chicken strips hand down.  I wished we had some in Orange County.  It sure beats eating that crap at KFC!   Heres the breakdown...  Chicken fingers: thumbs waaaaaaay up.  The chicken was moist and tender.  There was just enough coating and just enough crispy-ness to the outside.  I can eat 10 of them just by myself!! The special dipping sauce makes these fingers unbelievable.   Texas toast: thumbs up!  Crispy and buttery outside.. soft and fluffy on the inside.  You can taste the artery clogging butter on the toast! YUMMM  Sweet tea: mind blowingly good.  So good that we had to grab a jug of the ish to go.  My bf wants to stop by Cane's on our next vegas trip and get jugs of the tea to mix with our booze!  Fries:  good but i've had better.  Verdict?  The chicken is damn tasty.  It may seem pricey but its a lot better than going to the strip and having dinner somewhere.  If you're looking for a good place to go after a drunken lunch on the strip head here for some meaty goodness."}
{"text":"*****MUST READ TILL THE END*****  This place is probably THE worst Cane's I've been to. My friend spilt his drink outside and he walked up to the drive-through. They told him \"You need a car to get another drink.\" They made him get his car from the parking lot to get a drink and wasted everyone's time when instead they could've filled up his cup THEN AND THERE. One of the employees also denied to take my other friend's order when the store itself was almost closed (but the drive-through was still open). He then asked for to-go and the manager stepped in and took care of it. There's no difference in giving food at the front or the drive-through."}
{"text":"The menu is extremely limited- chicken, toast and fries. I ordered the chicken strips deal through the drive thru and was very disappointed. The chicken was ok but the fries and toast were soggy as if they had been sitting out for quite some time. When I got to the window I asked for ranch, but they only serve their Cane's sauce? Why limit my options even more... Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"As long as you like chicken fingers you'll be happy cause thats all they sell :-) Love the sweet tea and texas toast :-) The sauce is yummy...people dont think they get enough sauce but I think one is enough for me...then again I don't bathe my strips in sauce either."}
{"text":"My husband ate here one time without me and said it was too salty, so for the past 2 years, I've avoided this place. While waiting in this area to get picked up, I had a craving for chicken fingers and decided to stop in AND OMG I WAS SO MAD AT MY HUSBAND. To think, for two years I was missing out on some of the best chicken fingers ever created (too much enthusiasm, maybe?). Their dipping sauce is just a simple ketchup/mayo/spices mix, but I'm easily won over by the combination apparently. I like how their fries have ridges, with a good mix of mushy fries to schlop up sauce and ketchup and crispy ones for texture. I was also really impressed with the service here - reminded me a bit of Chick-Fil-A in the south, where they'll deliver the food to your table (most of the time, the food was ready long before the customers could even decide on which soda to get). The staff does a great job turning over tables and moving things along swiftly. Now I understand why their drive-thru line is always packed, but I do need to start coming here less and remember, this place is still fast food."}
{"text":"Raising canes is always a must have! From the Texas toast to the chicken fingers.. everything is delicious! The best part is that it's still good as left overs later. We need one in LA asap!"}
{"text":"Typically i hate canes, undercooked fries, soggy chicken and not enough sauce. But today i was so hungry and shopping at sprouts i had to get some food and canes was just there with no line.   I got home and thought to myself your gonna hate it but oh well, dont do this to yourself again. But this time was diffrent, i bit into my chick expecting a soggy mess but instead, CHRUNCH. I was so suprised, really crunchy chicken, so then i went to the fries, and they were good too, i was so impressed i completed it with the though, maybe the other location was so bad and i just didnt know it. Hats off to who ever was cooking tonight at 7:30 pm. you have changed my opinion on canes, and i will definetly be back if this is the quality food you are serving.   but you guys are still stingy with your sauce, That must be a brand thing, but its so good :)"}
{"text":"I think that was just about the worst meal I ever ate. I ended up throwing half of it away. Yuck"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Raising Cane's and had to have it while I was in Vegas. I always want to try new restaurants and prefer not going somewhere I've been before. I had to make an exception this time. We stopped in for a small, quick lunch.  The chicken tenders, fries, and Texas toast were tasty as always. I can't rave enough about Raising Cane's."}
{"text":"I stopped in to see what it's all about.   There's always a line of cars at the drive thru.  Must be good.  It is! Simple menu,  I got the three piece chicken.  Loved the sauce it comes with!  My crinkle fries were boring and barley warm, no salt so I skipped them after a few bites. The chicken was fantastic! Ill be back!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place.  I would hear people complain about this place only having one sauce for your chicken.  Well, there's a reason there is only one Cane sauce, because it makes you whole plate taste better.  I dip everything in this stuff.  well everything except the slaw!  The menu is simple and the chicken is always fresh.  The employees are always helpful and smiling unlike unhappy McDonald employees.  This place is the best! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Not much on the menu but their chicken is good, better than Chick-Fil-A. I got the box combo 4 Chicken Fingers, Fries, Coleslaw, 1 Cane's Sauce, Texas Toast, Regular Drink. I thought they had more sauces but they don't, it's only 1 and it's nasty. It taste like ketchup, black pepper, and mayonnaise all together. Yuk! lol I notice the outside kind of looks like Culver's.."}
{"text":"First thing I have to put out there is that I am super stoked to be this close to a Raising Cane's! In my previous neighborhood I was no where near a RC, which was a damn shame, let me tell you! After a trip to the wonderful Home Depot, we decided to have our first taste of Raising Cane's in (literally) years.  It isn't the cheapest option available but I never feel like I just got gypped off when I order there.   Those chicken tenders are pretty damn good! For this visit we each got a combo that included 6 chicken tenders, a side of cole slaw, texas toast a slop of fries and a 32 ounce drink. This cost roughly $8 each. Not a bargain but at least you get a lot of food for that price. Besides the yummy chicken fingers, that texas toast was freaking delicious! I guess additional pieces are $1 a piece. The only thing I didn't particularly care for were the french fries. They were of the puny crinkle variety. Meh.  Also meh was the service. Not horrible, but also I felt like the young lady who assisted us was annoyed. Not quite sure if she was annoyed by our presence or something else but it was definitely a bit off putting. Maybe she was just having a bad day.   At this price point though Raising Cane's will have to be a once in a while treat and not something I grab on a regular basis. I think this place also has the potential to move to 4 stars in the future but for the time being 3 stars feels about right.  3 stars."}
{"text":"I love coming to Cane's when in Vegas. The chicken tenders are always juicy because they are never frozen. There's a special sauce that compliments the chicken so well. It tastes like peppered thousand island dressing. Combo comes with chicken in your choice of 3 thru 10 pieces,  crinkle fries, texas toast and coleslaw but if you want to substitute coleslaw for another Texas toast, you can do that.  Cane's is not franchised so they can control the quality of each and every store. Fabulously delicious!"}
{"text":"Raising canes is one of my favorite spots! This location is super clean and even has a disco ball at the entrance lol."}
{"text":"I usually eat at this location. I used to be satisfied everytime but the last 3 times ive gone has been terrrible! 1 time all 3 chicken strips were tiny. The last 2 times the chicken strips tasted terrible. Smelled as if the oil was very old & smelled burnt. Was so gross! I have not been back to this location. Hopefully they get it together soon! I miss the good Canes!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest Caines in town. Drive thru jams up all the time causing tempers to flare. The parking lot isn't set up for a line of cars. Been in a few close calls with bad drivers."}
{"text":"I don't know how you can not rate RC as five-stars.  Seriously.  We get this EVERY damn trip to Vegas.  Man, I'd probably go as far as to say we've probably driven to Vegas some weekends years ago just to get it.  It is like blue magic maaaaan.  Friendly service, delicious food, reasonable prices, clean dining / bathroom areas, is there anything more you'd like from a \"fast-food\" spot?  No.  It is chicken finger nirvana."}
{"text":"Back in February, when the BF's brother & gf came along for a spontaneous trip to Vegas, they demanded Raising Cane's.  First off, I'm not a real big fan of fried chicken (at least if the fried chicken in discussion is KFC, Popeye's & the like).  I am a real big fan of toast, specifically texas toast & garlic toast.  The two together = why I ordered 6 slices of toast to take back to the hotel to munch on in case I got so 'slizzered' that I would be sleeping next to the toilet all night.  Moving on though, I love you Raising Cane's.  I love your toast (swap the coleslaw for an extra slice!), I love your chicken (strips!), I love your sauce (one extra please!), I love your iced tea (jug to go please!) and I love your service (always extra, super duper nice!).  Other nice perks:  PLENTY of parking.  next to a cupcake shop (which I've never tried, because I'm so full, but always swear I will the next time), drive-thru (a rarity for chicken spots), next to a Walmart (super convenient), fast service, clean bathrooms, clean eating area, funky decor.  Oh, and all of this at a fantastically reasonable price."}
{"text":"Whether you just need a quick carb-heavy meal to load up on before you pregame it in the room and throw it all up in the hotel/club bathroom later, or a Super Bowl extravaganza that you'll friends'll always remember you for, or you are demanded to bring some back to LA because if not, you're friends will never entertain your calls/texts again, this is the place for you.    Now, it's chicken fingers.  It's fried chicken fingers.  I know what I'm getting myself into when I go in, so I'm not going to down-rate them for that (that's like rating Cinnabon one star because it's so sweet - you had to have known that coming in, so why bother?).  At any rate, let's make it short & sweet.  If you can, eat here, so nothing get's soggy.  If you HAVE to order to-go (or to-go-bring-back-to-LA), swap out the fries AND the coleslaw (do you really want it anyway?) and get extra toast.  Feel guilty about it?  If you get the Caniac combo which comes with 6, then serve two pieces + bread and your own veggies at home to break down the 'crazy' calories, fat & carbs you \"couldn't\" have known fried chicken, texas toast & coleslaw might possibly have.  Oh, and don't forget the sweet tea (which is sweet -if you don't like that, then get the UNsweetened tea).    Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"I really like Cane's and now there is one just up the street from my residence. I like Raising Cane's, but my kids are raving fanatics about the place!   As with all new places, this one is not quite as good as the older brother located on University Ave. My recent midday family trip had our strips slightly tepid, orders slightly off and the fries just \"meh\". However the wait staff is trying hard as the infatuated rush rolls in.  We will be back, probably many times.  Don't forget to request your Cane' s Caniac Club Card! With this you can register your card on line and get a free Box Lunch, within several days, after signing up.   ...hey isn't that Chick Fila' , just up the street?  *^_^*"}
{"text":"I'm not reviewing this place based off of the atmosphere or the customer service because it doesn't matter when the food is bland and their is nothing that makes it special or unique. The only thing that gets a good rating is the sauce. You only get one thing of it, and if you want more it's extra, the chicken batter is tasteless  and you need to dose it in suave for it to be good, also the fries having no seasoning or flavor on them. If you want real fast food fried chicken go to chic fil a, or Zaxbys(which isn't in Arizona yet, but I hope it is soon) this are 100 times better and this goes for all raising canes stores. I would only go here for the sauce and the Texas Toast, literally that's it"}
{"text":"Raising Canes is awesome! Just got back home from swinging by after the wife was craving it and of course I'll never pass down some good chicken haha. Ended up going back a mile and some change just so we could pick up a Carniac combo w/ the best Mug Rootbeer. The atmosphere is laid back and staff have never been rude in anyway, prices are pretty good too, definitely a place worthwhile!"}
{"text":"Is it the cute lab or the delicious chicken fingers and lemonade that keep us coming back? The service is always great too! We miss Chic-fil-A so much and this place helps a bit :) The menu is simple, but that's the beauty of it. Everything on the menu is done well. Sure the fries aren't gormet quality, but I don't go to a chicken place for fries anyway! I really can't complain about anything here so I have no choice but to give all five stars!"}
{"text":"It's about time that someone showed some Raising Cane love. I've never had a bad meal here. The chicken is hot and delicious. My wife and I usually share the Caniac which is six ginormous chicken fingers, texas toast, fries, coleslaw and a large drink for about $9.50 when tax is included. I almost forgot, you also get two containers of their Cane sauce, I usually swap that out for the honey mustard sauce. And since my wife likes the texas toast, we 86 the coleslaw and get another texas toast. That's another advantage of this place, you can substitute your sides.   I found it hilarious reading some of these previous yelp reviews which praise the chicken but only give a two star review. My only complaint is that they don't have biscuits like Popeyes."}
{"text":"I really like this place because it has a lot of potential. One of the tweaks I would make is to get a decent honey mustard dipping sauce. Also, I thought calling out people's name in the restaurant with their food order was annoying. I guess I find that annoying because I was trying to get some reading in during the lunch break. I did like their ketchup dispenser. No more worrying about ketchup splattering on your shirt. Next time I'll have to take a picture of it.  This was my first time in a Raising Cane so I decided to order the Caniac which consists of 6 chicken strips plus a bunch of crinkle fries and a soda for about $8 dollars. I thought you get a lot for your money. I enjoyed the chicken strips but they would have tasted much better with the honey mustard sauce."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've had Canes at everyone's suggestion! It was really really good! The chicken strips are awesome as is the cole slaw and toast. The fries however were all very burnt. The biggest concern I had though is the styrofoam container as it appears it melted from the heat of the chicken! I'm not sure how good safe that is and would suggest a better alternative like paper containers. What fumes or chemicals come from styrofoam I'm not sure but can't be too good"}
{"text":"This place has set the standard on chicken fingers and now they are number 1 get the box combo and you are sure to be satisfied with the amount of food"}
{"text":"CANES SAUCE!!!   my mom brought me to canes one day to get lunch and i love it soooo much. this is the first one that popped up and they have always had great service and amazing food. the chicken is always hot and fresh. the sauce as they say is boss!! also they have texas toast, of so yummy. and the have crinkly fries. everything is always fresh and made right when you order it, i love that. it just makes my tummy happy. the have a couple different box options, my favorite is the kids meal, perfect size. if im felling really hungry might do the 3finger combo or the sandwich combo. just gotta get extra sauce for that:)   THE SAUCE!!"}
{"text":"So delicious, I wish we had one at home in Colorado Springs!!  Real food, fast, and inexpensive...what more can you ask for?  I can't stop singing.....I'm a Caniac, Caniac...I know LOL"}
{"text":"I never thought a fast food place such a limited menu would a be this good.   Kind of costly, but a good meal.   The line always looks long, but it moves fast & is worth the wait"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I can count on the cashiers being friendly and full of energy and The establishment is clean leaving me the joy of being able to sit down with my meal and not having to wipe up anyone's left over chicken crumbs.    Ok more about the food...  The chicken is always fried perfect and is fresh.  Never over cooked but always a golden brown color.  Fries don't taste like they've been cooked in week old oil and the Texas toast is amazing!  Don't forget to get an Arnold Palmer.  For those of you who are unfamiliar it's a sweet tea and lemonade mixed."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fresh and juicy chicken strips, this is the place.  Great customer service and they get your order done quick.  Make sure to get a combo that comes with the toasted bread, so good."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend. What a mistake!.  I didn't want a combo since I can't eat the fries... this revelalation was rewarded with a deer-in-the-headlights look.  I asked how large the chicken fingers were and was told they were something akin to enormous, so I ordered three.  When I asked about sauces I was told they had ketchup or a  spicy sauce for which they charge extra. Not even any ranch dressing!!! When the fingers arrived they were very thin and nowhere near enormous.  Pretty tasteless is the best I can say. Stick with Popeye's."}
{"text":"They use coconut oil when they make their chicken. It is healthy and you really can taste the difference. This location has super fast service it has too because ASU is close by and it is always packed. Will come back and back and back."}
{"text":"A must have if you're in Vegas! As a Californian I'm not sure why we don't have this deliciousness! Only sides are fries slaw(I subbed this out for extra toast) and Texas Toast but really that's all you need."}
{"text":"WOW! Not a bad price for some great chicken strips, some amazing garlic bread and the Cane's sauce is literally like Heaven! I always substitute my coleslaw for another Cane's sauce because I can't get enough! They have some easy to choose combos which help me decide what's best for me depending on how hungry I am at the time. Give them a try! I should also note that the manager of the store I visited and the current cashier were some of the nicest folk around."}
{"text":"Love Cane's!!! It is very good, we eat here almost every other night LITERALLY!  We always order 3 sandwiches and always get the same great results. No more, no less, just the way we like things when it comes to our food."}
{"text":"This is one of three Raising Cane's I've been too and it's probably the worst one. We ordered through the drive-thru which wasn't too busy. We just wanted to be in and out of there. Our fries were stale and our bread was soggy, but my boyfriend and I were too tired to go back and complain. I've really never had any complaints about any Raising Cane's up until this point. I'll just make a mental note not to come back this one."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite chicken fingers place! The food here is so good and simple! Chicken fingers, fries, toast, coleslaw, and a drink for $8! I got extra fries instead of a coleslaw. Soooo cheap! And it's really filling as well! The service here is amazing too! I love how they bring you the food.   I wish they had a Raising Cane in NorCal (SF)! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here my son loves it, I got the canaic and it is a fair amount of chicken, it is also battered well but there is no real flavor to it, the fries also had no flavor and were limp, the sauce they give you to dip I didn't find tasteful at all and then to top it off the reason I rate it so low is that I got the hi-c punch to drink and I thought that my teeth were gonna fall out from the sweetness of it, I had to dilute half of it with water and even then could still taste the sweetness, it's diabetes in a cup, only other thing that was good was the bread. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"You can't go to any UNLV sporting event without hearing about Raising Cane's so I finally decided to try it one day.  The first time I had it, simply amazing.  Now that I've begun to eat a little healthier I find that i feel really full right after and than lose energy a few hours later.  I enjoy getting the sandwiches and the Cane's sauce is very unique and gives the chicken just a tiny kick.  For whatever odd reason I also think the ice cubes here are cool, well they aren't cubes but almost perfect circles or hail stones for your soft drink.  Raising Cane's gives you a reason to root for the Rebel's as you get a free \"Runnin Rebel\" combo if they win (so expect a lot of canes in the winter, not so many during fall football ;) )"}
{"text":"What can I say?  I love this food.  The chicken is delicious the fries are crisp and hot and the Texas toast is melt in your mouth good.  Only negative and it's not really that serious is the Cole slaw which is just OK to me and not as good as the other items.  Always do drive through so can't comment on the service, but the drive thru line can be slow sometime, since they do make the chicken fresh."}
{"text":"Had an issue, and the management immediately solved it. No eye rolling, just respect for food and great service. Awesome. At this point they could spit on the food, and I would be happy."}
{"text":"I wanted to commend this branch b/c part of my order was not in bag when I got home. I called & spoke to Manager. He  apologized & gave me a credit for when I return on my next visit. The food was awesome as usual-hot fresh tasting fries, crispy chicken fingers, warm bread & tasty signature sauce. Thank you for making things right. I'll come back to your store for sure in the future.   Nice addition for the Aliante area. Maintain the.smiling employees & the great manager-Chris. Your business will thrive!"}
{"text":"I never knew chicken fingers could be this yummy. Better than any I have ever had. Does not even seem like \"fast food\"...besides the atmosphere of course. I hardly ever eat fast food, but these chicken fingers rock!..glad I finally tried it."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix so my son and I decided to try a new place.  My son thought it was bland and, while it's not a tasty as KFC, the chicken is moist, Texas toast tasty and the fried are decent."}
{"text":"I REALLY wish we had a Raising Cane's in California... it's simple, cheap and GOOD!!! Delicious, piping hot chicken breast strips and french fries, just begging to be dipped in their \"secret sauce\"...(Think thousand island dressing, with a kick)Their Sweet Tea is good too! and did I mention they have a drive-thru? While you're there, you might as well read the cool story about how they got the name \"Raising Cane's\"... not gonna spoil it for you, just gonna have to go and find out yourself..."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The staff here is always great!!! The only thing that sucks is that the drive through line is always packed. Other than that though, it's great!"}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders !! The garlic toast is awesome and the fries are yummy. Service has always been stellar, food is always hot and fresh. Oh and they have soft ice... that is always a bonus.  drive-thru is always busy it goes very fast. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i were going to vegas for the weekend. from the moment we left california, he would not stop talking about this place. we arrived around midnight and that was the first place he wanted to go to before we even checked in to our hotel... i agreed and thought to myself, this place better be worth it because i'm crazy tired. we went through the drive thru, ordered a 6 piece caniac to share and sat in the parking lot to eat. he made me take the first bite and to my amazement... OMG! it was freakin' good! the best chicken tenders you will ever have at a fast food restaurant. the chicken is real, for one...but besides that, it is juicy and tender with the perfect amount of breading to make it crispy.   needless to say, we stopped by before we headed back to cali... raising cane's is a must try!"}
{"text":"they told me that sauce was going to blow me away, and it so it did. i used it for everything including my fries and toast.  and that toast? soft and buttery and oh so good.   not feeling that coke or sprite? have yourself a sweet tea, its pretty good.  instant favorite. wish there were more everywhere! only in vegas i suppose  4.0/5.0"}
{"text":"Tried canes out for the first time and let me tell you PDQ tenders are hands down way better then Canes and the only good thing here is the bread chicken here is dry at PDQ there tenders are moist fresh hot and bigger and they have salads burgers and other sandwhichs canes better step it up a whole lot"}
{"text":"After a night flight coming from the east coast, we were hungry! it's like 1am eastern time, and this is right by the car rental building.  Right by the premium outlets, so it's easy to locate.  We stopped by, nobody was inside, lots of seating, and everything looked clean.  We ordered the 6 piece with crinkle fries, a texas buttered toast, coleslaw and a huge drink all for under $10.00! The chicken was freshly fried (was worried since nobody else was in there)  The chicken strips were nice and hot, huge strips.  Good batter, the sauce had a tang and accompanied the chicken very well.  Fries were nothing special.  The toast, oh my the toast was so good!!  It was soft and buttery, but just enough crunch on the outside!  We should have asked to trade the coleslaw for another piece of toast so I didn't have to share!!  Overall, I see what the hype is about!  A chain that only specializes in Chicken Fingers, that means it's gotta be good to only sell one thing! it's good!  If you're looking for a late night tummy filler for cheap, come here! The combo is good enough to share between 2!  Next time I want to try the lemonade after reading all the reviews.  I opted for sweet tea which was pretty good!"}
{"text":"After a couple of long nights of partying at EDC there's nothing better than  some deep  fried  goodness to fill the belly. I have never heard of this place until my sister's boo started to rave about how awesome the chicken strip were when passed by one . So what the heck I'm going to give this place a try with my bf.  The only thing I can compare this place to is chik-fil-a.  The boyfriend got the box combo? I believe and i got the 3 finger combo. The toast is amazing and the sweet tea is to die for. Well, not to die for but still one of the best sweet tea I have tasted in a long while. The chicken strips are juicy and the fries are just regular crinkle cut fries. The cane sauce is okay. Reminds me of thousand island and French dressing put together. But the chicken strips tasted wonderful without any sauce.  The boyfriend says the coleslaw is whatever. Overall, the place is good for the price and the portion is good too."}
{"text":"Love eating here.the food is all ways hot and fresh every time I order.keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Great service and great fresh food.  Even when there is a super long line they move fast and efficiently.  The chicken tenders are always fresh and taste great. Their sauce is the real deal, people complain they only have one sauce but that one sauce is the best!  Keep up the good work Cane's."}
{"text":"Very simple menu and good chicken fingers. Sometimes simple really is better. I know people don't like that they only have one dipping sauce , but the sauce is really good. We had the decently priced combos which included fries, a drink and a roll."}
{"text":"Was kind of excited to check this plcae out. Especially since my kids love chicken fingers and order that wherever we go. Walked in and loved the charm of this place, big posters of Elvis, Beatles, movie posters like Hangover 2, dispecible me... Catchy music blaring and a disco ball hanging over the register area. My kids loved it already, but once we got over all of that and read the small menu I was shocked. I looove chicken fingers, but I just can't believe that's all they had along with fries and cole slaw..that's it ? Really??... we went ahead and ordered, the food was very good,but we really wanted other things than just fries. They need more sides, more choices in dipping sauce. The kids wanted ranch, not the peppery ,tangy sweet sauce they offered. Hubby wanted mashed potatos n' gravy and wasn't crazy about the runny cole slaw, I would have loved some buffalo wing sauce..but all they had was fries, toast, cole slaw and their special sauce. Like I said food was good, atmosphere charming, but no choices in menu. Everyone gets the same thing basiclly. I will be back though, food was good, simple and I know kids will eat it!"}
{"text":"the food is sooo good but the service is slow and needs help bad .. drive through takes for even when it's just on car ahead of u .. never should happen girls on the speaker ask tons of same questions.. I dont know its it's speaker problem"}
{"text":"I love you Canes and your crunchy delicious chicken and amazing secret sauce.    Oh and your staff is great too."}
{"text":"Oh how I love when my office gets raising canes for lunch meetings. Very fresh/hot everything we get it  and some of the best chicken fingers  even though it's fast food. Texas toast plus fries is a little overkill and bland but I guess that's what the cane's sauce it for. Yum! Love their sweet tea also. I rarely eat fast food but when I do, you can count on this place being one of my options!"}
{"text":"This is me trying to make these things somewhat passable Friday night. Don't get the big deal.  This is the second and final time we will spend any money at this place.  And this was not even my choice. Obviously the person frying didn't care enough to shake the basket even once. Again, don't get why ppl say it's so good.  Never again."}
{"text":"My sons and I favorite fast food fried chicken on the planet!!!! Fantastic staff that are caring amd love their work!! Love the lemonade and the Canes sauce is amaaaaazimg!!!!"}
{"text":"I give this a 3 star, my daughter gives it a 4 star.  The place was great, easy to find and get in and out of.  The food was just OK for me.  It was nice going into a place and not worrying about what to order, they only have chicken tenders, fries and Texas toast.  After that you just get to decide on how much you want."}
{"text":"Well let's see after driving in 30 minutes of traffic to sit in a 40 minute line to get food, and after they repeated my order back to me three separate people, my balding ill daughter had to get a sandwich with no toast tonight.  One of the only thing she still looks forward to thank you so much for really making her night!"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is a reliable standby. They are always consistent and provide a good chicken tender, salty, crunchy Texas toast, crinkle cut fries with standout Cane sauce (kind of like a chipotle aioli) and homemade lemonade. I like that they're quick and efficient and sometimes you just want juicy fried chicken tenders. One great thing is that Clark County school teachers get 10% off with ID and their Caniac's club card (free) actually provides good rewards, including a free Box meal! The price is right and it's good."}
{"text":"Stop by today to buy the \"the hard hat\" family value. Notice that it didn't come with fries. Brandon the manager are nice enough to give me two order of fries at no charge. The employee at this place are nice. If your staying at the strip don't forget to grub canes and see brandon."}
{"text":"Not as great as everyone claims. We ordered the box (4 strips). It was good and filling but the chicken wasn't as crispy as I liked & everything else wasn't fresh. I went late at night around 11. Maybe it was just the location or time of day? Going to try again later"}
{"text":"I would describe Raising Cane's as the chicken version of In-N-Out because they only sell one thing and that's chicken strips.  The restaurant is decorated with Movie memorabilia. It's kind of odd considering it has nothing to do with the food but I liked it. The employees genuinely seem happy to be there and are extremely helpful.  My boyfriend and I both ordered the chicken finger sandwich with fries and a drink. The fries were great and I enjoyed my chicken sandwich. I don't know how to describe the taste of their house sauce but I like it a lot. I used it on my fries and my sandwich.   I had a good experience here. I think they need to jazz up the menu with more sauces and offer additional side items. I'll be back when I have a random craving for tasty chicken fingers!"}
{"text":"This place was simple, had great food, and a nice atmosphere for a fast food place. I'm from the South, and down there we have a GREAT chicken finger's place called Zaxby's...this was extremely similar, and very good. The homemade sauce is like a bbq, mayo, tangy, ranchy sauce, and goes great with the seasoned crinkle fries and chicken fingers. I loved that they had crushed ice and real home-brewed sweet tea."}
{"text":"Order is always 100% and the people who work there are hilarious. Always love going to this canes!"}
{"text":"This Cane's is always packed- for a reason. A good place to go for lunch or dinner if you are willing to wait in a sometimes brutal line. I LOVE the food here, and I go all the time, but I'm giving a 3 star because of the way the restaurant is set up. The drink machine is too close to the counter so it's always packed over there and hard to refill your drink. There's nowhere for the line to go other than right by other people's tables. I was sitting in the last booth before the order counter and I could barely hear my mom who was sitting right next to me. On top of that, the restaurant's music is always reeeeeaaaaally loud. I wouldn't suggest eating inside the restaurant if you want to be able to actually enjoy eating and conversation. I've had a couple really unfortunate incidences in their ladies restroom. It's either really clean or it's a nightmare, although this isn't really their fault since customers are usually teenagers and even some of the lesser well off people around the area. I'm usually fine with waiting for my food because it's just too good to never wait in line for it. Overall, I'd suggest going at times that aren't height lunch or dinner times, because I've seen the line get all the way out the door. They really should've made this location bigger."}
{"text":"For pieces of chicken tenders, this place is pretty good. You have a choice of getting a number of chicken tenders with fries, toast, and a drink.   Cane's chicken never fails to satisfy me. They're always hot right when it gets to your table. Crunchy on the outside, tasty on the inside. You can also ask for their special sauce and that goes well with everything! Fries are almost never soggy and the toast is amazing. You also can't forget about their sweet tea!   The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because I feel like it'd be better if it was a $1 or 2 cheaper."}
{"text":"Not in the running as far as being the best chicken fanger in town.    Fairly decent serving sizes, but when you specialize in Fangers, your Fangers better be AWESOME !!  These can be \"very good\" when fresh out of the fryer, but they are not AWESOME !!  Coleslaw was completely pedestrian and bland.  (Rock-n-Roll Fingers in Tempe does a far better job at making and selling the kind of chicken fangers that Raising Cane's oughta strive for.)  I'm giving these guys one extra star because AWESOME fangers are hard to find in the fast food realm, and these are above average for sure."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers in town for fast food.  Fries are bomb. And get lemonade it's also really good. Don't come here if you want a burger, chicken fingers only. Get the Caniac feeds two."}
{"text":"This is the only location that we visit. It's always crowded with families eating but the staff is quick to clean up any areas that need it in a timely manner. The staff is always nice, helpful and friendly! No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Thank you soooo much for the teacher appreciation food!!! It was so delicious!!! This place is great!!!"}
{"text":"Very good chicken. I LOVE THE SAUCE ! FRENCH BREAD IS DELICIOUS.  The employees are always very very nice. I eat here about twice a month"}
{"text":"Raising canes is always great. It is my guilty pleasure. I am sure there are at least 1200 calories in a box combo and a crazy amount of salt. My tip is to ALWAYS eat in. The few times I have done take out the fries and strips get soggy due to the steam they project. The staff always brings the food to your table and are strangely friendly for working in food service. Maybe they are like in & out and pay a decent wage for food service?"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the combo with 3 chicken fingers, Texas toast, fries and a drink for about $6. If you order them separately you don't get a dipping sauce. Plenty of seating and food was brought out to the table. Chicken fingers were soft and juicy, not very crispy on the outside. Fries were so so, I've had better but they do give you a lot. I LOVE the Texas toast here, it's soft and buttery.   There was a bunch of people that came in around 1 which was surprising but food came out super fast."}
{"text":"My friends who live in Vegas wouldn't stop talking about this place so we finally tried it before we went clubbing.   It surprised me that the drive through line was so long because they don't have a lot of menu options.   Maybe we waited too long to eat our food, but the chicken tenders and french fries were so-so. The toast was unfortunately the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"The Best Chicken!!!! The staff is very friendly and make you feel welcome. For every place who has bad customer service needs to be trained by Raising Cane's!! I'll be back."}
{"text":"we call it the crack house because they have to be putting something in it to keep you craving for more. Unbelieveably delicious. I'm about to run out right now and get me some more. love love love my caniac. One love. xoxoxo."}
{"text":"This location isn't as crowded as the one on Las Vegas Blvd.  the staff here are very attentive and make sure everything is correct.  As a matter of fact they thought they forgot to give me part of my order & tried to give me extra. I did tell them my order was correct and nothing else was needed.  This location. Is very clean."}
{"text":"Love the simplicity,  chicken fingers or chicken fingers.   Fresh & hot when you order.  The ice tea & lemonade are an added bonus.  Not to mention the toast !  Always friendly staff even when extremely busy"}
{"text":"\"Hello...My name is Chris and I am a Caniac\", there...they say the first step is admitting, the second is eating!!!  When I first drove by the construction for this store (blocks from my house), I practically peed myself in anticipation.  I still remember the first time I had Canes, I was baffled at the fact that the menu has pretty much 2 things on it, Chicken Fingers and French Fries. They only a few combos, but when you do it this good you don't need other options.  Their Chicken Fingers are great, the fries are good, the Texas Toast and cole slaw are good sides, but there are 2 things that keep bringing me back to Cane's.  #1-Cane's Sauce...I have no clue what all goes into making Canes Sauce, but I'm pretty sure it includes crack, this stuff is addictive, I like it on my chicken fingers, french fries, and toast, hell if I could get a bathtub full of it, I would!!!  #2-Lemonade...I have not drank a single serving of soda since in about 9 years, most of the time whenever I go out, I drink water, but Cane's Lemonade is AMAZING, they make it fresh every day, and it is hands down the best Lemonade I've every had at a restaurant (chain or otherwise)  I have also hear great things about their Iced Tea, I wouldn't know since I'm not a fan of Iced Tea."}
{"text":"You may think this place just sells chicken fingers but Raising Canes sells tons of things. They sell from chicken fingers to Texas Toast. I love the 3 Chicken Finger Combo, especially the sauce. Everything was good and crispy. The customer service extremely good and was nice to their customers. Definitely would come back and dine in again!"}
{"text":"Ever since I told my parents to try Raising Cane's, we have been eating here at least once every week for the last few weeks. Everytime we want to eat Raising Cane's, we always dine in.   We order: 2 X Caniac Combo - 6 Chicken Fingers each combo - French Fries - Texas Toast - Instead of Coleslaw, got a substitute of an extra Texas Toast - Large drinks  The food here is good and always hot! Their Sweet Tea here are to die for! If you want less sugar for your cold tea, pour half sweet tea and unsweetened tea. It taste very good and not too sweet which is perfect for me. They also have the large hard plastic Limited Edition Raiders cups here.  The place here is always clean and the staff here are friendly to serve their customers. If you ever want to try or eat Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers, try this location! It's not as crowded since it's near Summerlin."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight for the very first time. I'm a big fan of chicken fingers however I usually end up really sick after eating them because most of the time chicken fingers are very greasy and have a really bad after taste, so needless to say, it's been pretty long since I've had chicken fingers. Let me just say that I've not burped up any funky tastes after eating here, or burped peroid for that matter. I was very impressed by the fact that the outside was crunchy and the inside was juicy and moist and it was cooked perfectly! The sauce is ok however I don't like mayo based sauces and I like my fingers plain with bbq sauce or louisiana hot sauce. The fries were good but I will say that I have had better fries at other places. The texas toast was a great compliment to the fingers, grilled but soft and not slathed in oil or butter. I didn't eat the cole slaw because well I just don't like cole slaw. LOL. Overall, I think it's a good value for the amount of food you get, the menu is no-fuss, kinda reminds me of In-N-Out Burger with long drive-thru lines, a small menu and friendly workers."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas from Hawaii, we wanted to try different places to eat. Raising Canes was suggested by another family member who had tried Raising Canes the last time she visited Las Vegas.  We went to the location, closest to the UNLV campus.  They have ample parking and a drive thru.  We entered in the restaurant, and it was packed with people on a late Friday afternoon. That's a good sign to try this place.  We took awhile to look at their small menu but decided to order a meal pack that comes with chicken tenders, texas toast, fries, and cole slaw. EVERYTHING WAS SO DELICIOUS! WOW! I read that they hope to open a Raising Canes in Hawaii... I seriously hope they do!   Service was quick and the restaurant was clean.  I would definitely come back to eat there again. Just writing this review is making me crave their chicken and texas toast!!! *drool*"}
{"text":"Went thru the drive thru today. A little busy but that was to be expected since it was 6:30 pm. Not a long wait and service was good. Was nice to find out I actually got my combo box for free with my Cane's card!"}
{"text":"I came here back in February for the first time, my friend who lives out here said we all had to try it. They serve nothing but chicken fingers, I'm serious, just chicken fingers. I was hesitant to try the Cane Sauce (I heard more about the Sauce then the chicken from my friends) and I am very glad I tried it, it's amaze-balls!!!! I have to come to Raising Cane's whenever I visit Las Vegas, it's a must no matter what my plans are."}
{"text":"OMG! I wasn't happy with this joint at all.. I ordered my food and my daughters food we see one of the staff member who u front refilling the lemon aide behind the counter. The counter person took a lid to scrap of the foam off the top of the drink. She used a plastic soda top bare handed with no gloves. She scraped the foam off the scraped the lid inside of the garbage can then placed the same lid back into the lemon aide and repeated this procedure until she got enough foam off and place the cover back on lemon aide. She decided to play with foam with her co-work and throw some foam on the co-worker up front. The were chasing each other laughing and screaming. Another co-worker came from the back w/ no gloves pushing a full big trash can emptying the garbage from the front counter. A customer came in and she stopped and started attending to the customer up front... No washing of the hands or sanitizer nothing. I couldn't eat my food we ended up throwing away.. This is the second time observed no washing of hand's , touching emptying garbage and no gloves... I have reported the to the health board to come and observed...Raising cane is going to kill people due to their in sanitary practices...I will not go back until I see and up to date grade on this restaurant....."}
{"text":"The chicken is so moist!! We visited for a soccer tournament.  So yummy!! I was excited to learn that one is being built near me in So. Cal. This facility was clean,  staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Everyone has experienced that zombie, cashed out feeling when returning from a wild trip in Vegas.  You also may be leaving broke as shit.  This is where Cane comes through and makes your trip worthwhile.  If you have about 9 dollars to your name, you could feast out on some of the best chicken your sorry ass has ever had!!  They pile a fat helping of fries along with some texas toast and coleslaw.  I say forget the slaw and switch out for two texas toasts!  Don't even get me started on the Cane sauce...if there's anyway to describe the Cane sauce, it's simple.  The Cane sauce is the truth...  Also a good meal if you're trying to get a good snack in you before getting annihilated.  Be safe yelpers!"}
{"text":"Chicken fingers, crinkle-cut fries, coleslaw and toast, that's the menu.   The fingers were good, larger than the ones at Guthrie's. The fries were good, the toast was so-so, coleslaw (I don't like coleslaw, so I'm not one to judge, my coworkers say it's good)  The staff was great, I actually thought they were overstaffed (it's hard to tell, the kitchen was full of people, but they do catering, so some of the people might be there to support that). Anyway, it made for a great customer experience. They greeted me when I arrived. The girl who took my order, delivered my food to the table when it was ready and asked if I needed anything. The other counter girl was out cleaning tables, stopped by my table, asked how everything was, we talked a bit, she offered to refill my drink. Again, the staff here was great.  I typically don't give 4 stars to fast food, the service here was over the top, they deserve it. I will definitely go there again.  I can't believe the difference in customer service, between two stores of the same business. By comparison, the Cane's at Decatur and Charleston, act as though they are doing you a favor to take your order, yell your name when it's ready, so you can go and get it and I have never had anyone ask if everything is alright, let alone offer to refill my drink. That location would get 2 stars."}
{"text":"I got the Caniac combo and it's was really good. Love the house sauce the have. Good portions and it's not pricy. Only thing I can complain about is being charged extra for lemonade and it wasn't even that great to begin with. Overall great food for the price. Definitely would recommend to my friends and family."}
{"text":"I don't take recs on places to eat in Vegas.  I don't need them, I'm out here enough to find my own gems.  However, a dear former Chicago yelper told me this place was the totes.  I had always driven past it but chalked it up as another chain.  That's not the case, she said.  It's home to childhood memories of greasy eating and awesome chicken fingers.  She was completely right!  Though I definitely don't need another one, thanks for another grease pit to enjoy!  In-n-Out just might have some competition now.  Once i get off the plane, it's not so simple anymore; do i want chicken fingers or animal style fries?  It's so close to my parents' house that I have yet another option for food once the gambling hunger kicks in after a night at the tables.  The menu is simple: chicken fingers, and more chicken fingers.  I was baffled at how tender they can get the chicken.  I feel like i'm almost eating healthy! (operative word: almost)  The cane's sauce which I was specifically briefed on, was awesome.  What's their secret?  You could dip anything in that sauce, and I did.  The texas toast, fries, and chicken fingers all taste like little pieces of heaven when dipped in said sauce.  THE SAUCE!!!  The only problem?  Too many high schoolers.  Since it's next to a 24-hr smoothie cafe, this place is swimming with teenyboppers up to no good at night.  I felt like I was at the Peach Pit After Dark and Kelly and Donna were sitting next to us.  Or it felt like the Max, where Kelly, Jessie and Lisa were singing I'm So Excited as the group, Hot Sundae.  I could go on and on, but i'll stop myself."}
{"text":"I have always loved chicken and sometimes even if I am in a burger place I order chicken (IKR) so I was kind of excited to try this place which sells chicken. I ordered a Caniac Combo which was really big it came with 6 pieces of chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw and a toasted bread. The chicken fingers were big portions I only ended up eating three.  It was ok and their signature sauce was good. For a fast food meal I thought it was good. If I wanted some chicken tenders I would probably go here instead of other fast food chains just because for the price I get better and bigger piece of chicken.   I was disappointed though I was not offered for a Caniac Club card and that's just me I like joining rewards club and now I have to wait and ask for it the next time I visit."}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders! Always friendly with good customer service! They even have the really good small ice cubes!"}
{"text":"BOMBdotCOM!!! The chicken strips are perfectly seasoned and breaded deliciously!!! Not too fond of their canes famous sauce but honey mustard is waaay better. Keep in mind that these are their only 2 sauces...  Would definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"After reading the Yelp reviews, I was expecting a bit more. Here's my take on the 3 Finger Combo:  - chicken strips: definitely moist / juicy and cooked to order so not sitting under a heat lamp as they advertise. I was expecting a bit more crunch and batter - sauce: great sauce, although not the orgasmic experience a few mention, but indeed have to have it with the chicken fingers - fries: equivalent to Ore-Ida; can't beat the In-n-Out fresh fries: you can tell the difference - texas toast: mine was a less crunch like they took it out 10 seconds sooner than it should  Kids did eat everything on the kids meal so give Canes credit for that."}
{"text":"This is for the Cooper/Baseline location, but it didn't pop up.  I took my kids there since we won a free combo meal via a Diamondbacks game.  I read the reviews before I got there so I knew what to expect.  We typically go to Chick Fil A in Chandler.  Because no play area for the kids, the kids didn't like so much.  Admittedly, the chicken sandwich (made of 2 giant chicken strips) was huge so it was a good value..  I also ordered their kids meal and a chicken strip combo meal.  They were huge portions, Coleslaw was tasty, but I didn't care for the sauce or the crinkled french fries.  We had leftovers.  The lemonade was great.  I might go back to try other items but it is a limited menu.  Clean bathroom, too."}
{"text":"Neighborhood and the people around it a bit ghetto so keep your head on a swivel.   As far as the food...AMAZING! The Service...again, AMAZING! I don't know what they put in that sauce but I'd sure like to make some to eat with some things at home but then, it wouldn't be one of their signature items.   Great food. Not so great vagrants begging in the parking lot and coming in the restaurant filling up non-Raising Cane's cups. A little unsanitary since they look homeless. But, I just bless my food and keeps it pushin'."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I enjoyed everything. The customer service is great and the food is very tasty and delicious. At first I didn't know what to expect but it was good. The chicken, the fries and juice was done very well and taste really good."}
{"text":"Uh...is this place indicative of all locations?! My cousin from Texas is ALWAYS raving about this place and I made it a must on my recent trip to Vegas. But, I was soooooreely disappointed. Okay, exaggerating a little, but the main star - the chicken tenders - was the most disappointing part of the box! We got the box that comes with 4 tenders, Texas toast, slaw, and crinkle cut fries. And, of course, their special sauce. The toast was good 'cause it was salty and buttery (fat) and the slaw was fine. I also enjoyed their sauce, and really would not have eaten the chicken without it. The chicken, though, was DRY and the fries were soggy. Not to mention the drive thru was pretty slow at midnight! Only 1 or 2 cars in front of us and it took about 15 minutes to order and get our food."}
{"text":"Alright, so here's the break down. Raising Cane's is a great place, with a great story, selling GOOD food. Chicken fingers and fries. Its pretty hard to mess it up. What they do is is go the extra mile with great in house made lemonade, and sweet tea. I have experience in multiple states with this business and they are always a savvy choice.   They would have received 4 stars but this is not BATON ROUGE, this is TEMPE. And we have our own chicken  finger spot. Rock and Roll chicken fingers is a Tempe original, one man small business that does chicken fingers better. The famous Canes sauce, and even the Honey Mustard are the same and this guy has been doing it longer (and better, in my opinion). His fingers are slightly pricier, but much bigger. Hard to finish the regular plate in one sitting. The kicker? This guy will do them buffalo style!   So if your in Tempe, support the little guy. Not this growing chain. You wont regret it.  If your not in Tempe, go to Cane's."}
{"text":"I forgot to check in at the other cane's two days ago but decided to check in here cause this place has AWESOME customer service. Super friendly crew and super cheerful. Even the lady sweeping was greeting everyone. Food came out fairly quickly and was served to us at our seat. Definitely looking forward to visiting other locations and coming back here. Btw, the one by Tropicana and the 15 has awesome service as well."}
{"text":"How can you have a resturant with just chicken strips? Not sure how they do it but Cane's brings chicken strips to another level and pulls it off. Everything is very good, chicken, fries, bread, slaw and sauce. Better quality then most fast food and a great value."}
{"text":"Raising Canes serves chicken fingers to die for. I have friends that visit Vegas once a year and first thing they gotta do is get baked and get some canes. Never frozen and  perfectly beaded lightly. Sauce is legit. Fries can be soggy at times, the consistency is not good for the fries but fingers are usually good."}
{"text":"Great food, cool concept. 5 stars. But, what is being gained by withholding ranch from the menu? Grow up."}
{"text":"THEIR TOAST IS LIKE BABY JESUS ON A SLICE BREAD, evenly toast, lightly buttered and ALL !!!!!!!! The employees are nice and great energy. 1st time here and I am in LOVE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Canes on east Thomas is always awesome.  Food is fresh and Canes has the best chicken tenders period!!!   Also Coke Zero is mixed perfectly with tons of fizz and super cold.   The drive through is always fast, order always right and the gals at the window super nice.  If you like chicken fingers this is the best.   Good sauce too.   Awesome toast."}
{"text":"Chicken Fingers and Lemonade are awesome!   The cole slaw is horrible!  It's too coarse and flavorless. It tastes like you're just eating raw cabbage.  They need to make the coleslaw like KFC's."}
{"text":"***** SEX SUBSTITUTUE ******  I don't ever get tired of this place.  Secret Sauce is the boss -  the TX Toast, sweet Tea, and the chicken strips.......i want this on death row.  It's the seasoning in the strips and the sauce...you get that southern Nawlins feelen.     This place needs to be 24/7"}
{"text":"I love it, fresh, crispy, and juicy, in a word delicious.  They are doing something right because the chicken is fried but it never comes across as greasy.  I don't know where to start describing the sauce they have but at first I was sad they didn't have BBQ but now I can't get enough of it, like a pepper cream sauce?  The menu is real simple and all they have are chicken strips and some sides but if thats what you want you won't find any better.  Oh ya there fries are like dell tacos but always hot and crispy and I love the texas toast.    If you didn't know you can swap out sides in the box combos no charge so sometimes  I'll swap out the cole slaw for a second toast but then I am full for days.  All three locations I have been to have been the same and consistent."}
{"text":"Had to write this review for this location for my last visit to Vegas. Even though I stayed on the strip I come over to this location because the few times I've had the chicken it has never disappointed. My boyfriend at the time turned me on to this place and every time I come to Vegas this location is definitely on my list to stop and eat. Much better than the new locations in California I must say."}
{"text":"Although I've been a frequent patron of the Saks Fifth Outlet in the same shopping center for years, I've only recently tried Raising Cane's, mostly because I haven't quite bought into the Chicken Fingers concept.  Call me a health snob but I don't like to eat meat I don't recognize, and chicken fingers would rank #1 in this department.  My fiance is much less picky with fast food philosophies, and since Raising Cane's is so well-loved with Yelpers, I was convinced to give it a try, at the potential risk of sinking my teeth into Mystery Meat masqueraded as Chicken Fingers.  Well, the reward for my bravery was quite satisfying.  The chicken fingers tasted clearly to be good-quality chicken meat (more like pulled chicken, not minced chicken), moist, tender and flavorful.  The batter was also among the best, crispy without being too greasy.  The sauce is so delicious that I'd like to make this offer: if any Yelper knows the recipe to this sauce, please private message me for a bid.  I washed down these yummy chicken strips with the best sweet ice tea I've ever had.  I only speculate that it has to be made with real honey for that lingering subtlety of syrupy sweetness."}
{"text":"If you are hankering for fast-food, Raising Canes is the best option in my opinion. It's down the street from me so we go in a couple times a month, this location is just as clean, well kept, and fast as every other one I've visited. This location is a little bit busier than most though so the lines are a little long, but given it is near the Tempe ASU campus, it will be busy almost throughout the day.  As for the food itself, it's very tender battered and fried chicken fingers, lightly seasoned with a superb 'secret' dipping sauce on the side (you can find the identical recipe on Google or YouTube lol), with a side of coleslaw,  and buttered lightly browned Texan toast, you can ask to replace any of the sides with the another side. The ice tea is great, I get the sweetened version and it's fabulous. Not much more to say than that, the menu is small, but it's good comfort food (:"}
{"text":"Good chicken!  One of the better fast food chains.  Just beware there are a lot of transients  in the area.  They do have security and that security guard does need a raise! He is consistently running them off which I appreciate.  Due to the manner in which the transients were acting."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chicken strip place!! OMG I LOVE IT HERE!! I wish they had one in los angeles, so sad. But yeah everything here is BOMB!!! From their tasty toast to their sweet tea, OMG MADE TO PERFECTION. Can't leave out the chicken strip.. ooo la la.. i loveeeeeee it.. I think I want to move to vegas just for this restaurant. lol.. but yeah their sweet tea is better than mcdonalds. wayyy better. it has the right sweetness, delisssssssshh!! omg i just love it. LOVEEE YOUUU CANES!!"}
{"text":"I love Raising Cane's!  This specific location holds a special place in my heart since this is where I first tried Cane's years ago. There is always a crowd when I go here but it has seemed to become less and less of a crowd since they've opened so many locations now.  Service is fast and friendly, chicken strips are always good, place is always clean, no complaints here!  While you're over here make sure to visit the Welcome to Las Vegas sign!"}
{"text":"Canes is one of my fav places to eat at lunch, they were super fast and helped right away.  Cashier didn't talk or asked for anything, her service was pretty cold. It was clean and crew was cleaning as soon as people left which kept d place super clean and comfortable to eat."}
{"text":"There chicken is good and seasoned well.  The food always comes out fresh and hot.  We love there dipping sauce as well.  We got a 3 piece chicken box and a 4 piece chicken box for under $14; can't complain about that.  We have been to the one on Centennial parkway frequently and have never been disappointed.    The staff is always friendly and on top of keeping the dinning room clean.  Even tho they are almost always busy I never have to wait very long for food."}
{"text":"This Raising Canes is the absolute best! I have never had a problem but I know if I did the manager Eric would take care of me! He is the nicest person! Good food and even better service for sure!"}
{"text":"Dang - I think this place is awesome.  My mouth is watering just thinking about those chicken fingers.  My bf is not a chicken person but goes here.  Yes, they are just chicken strips.  But they are the finest chicken strips you will ever encounter, my friend."}
{"text":"This was the second time eating at Raising Cane's. The first time I was so sick from the flu and couldn't really taste anything and today. I love the way the staff greets you when you walk in, it was pretty busy so I was impressed that they didn't miss anyone. Andrea was super nice when she brought out our food she waited til we were done getting our drinks and sauces. Awesome service!  The food was ok i ordered a three piece that came with fries ,Cane's sauce and a piece of toasted bread. The chicken was breaded and very moist but not crispy at all ...bummer! The fries weren't good at all kinda cold and once again not crispy ... so sad. But on a side note I love the Cane's sauce , what's in it? It was so good !  This location was really nice with a big dinning area and very clean."}
{"text":"I came here one night after work to pick up food for dinner for me and my Honey, I was a little off-put because the line was so long but I DESPERATELY wanted Cane's so I bit the bullet.  SO GLAD I CAME TO THIS LOCATION!  i pulled to the first window and the Girl and i had some small talk about our work days and that she had a few hours left but it was busy so it was going by fast.   the second window girl was so bubbly and nice, & gave me extra ketchup when i asked without a fuss or fret.  THE CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE IS AWESOME! I work in customer service so I know how hard it is to be nice and bubbly after working a full shift while your job is slammed and these employees are awesome.  I might have just gotten lucky and got the great people but even so, they were great, I unfortunately cant remember their names to give them direct kudos.  and the food was great. cane's food is always super yummy."}
{"text":"Chicken Fingers Don't Get Any Better Then This.    If you are a Chicken Finger  lover, like my nephew I encourage you to give Raising Canes a try. These Fried Chicken Fingers take a back seat to no one. Raising Canes boneless Chicken Strips and dipping sauce are hard to beat.    Raising Canes never-frozen chicken tenderloins are fryed-to-order and accompanied by the best dipping sauce known to man.  The meat stays juicy, none of the dryness problems that plague lesser variations of fried chicken strips. The Chicken Strip combo box is served with crinkle cut fries, Texas toast, and a side of coleslaw.  You have to try the fresh squeezed lemonade, it's the best.   Raising Canes has quick service and friendly staff, so if your in the mood for chicken fingers, head on over."}
{"text":"First timer! And it was absolutely delicious! I ordered the 3 chicken strips order & chicken was soo juicy loved the buttery bread! I also got the freshly squeezed lemonade upgrade for .35 cents more. What's with that secret sauce? Well it was awesome I used it as a dipping sauce for my bread. I'll try to come by a little earlier perhaps lunch since it's a all place and can get really crowded."}
{"text":"I like this location and love the food. Only down side is it can get pricey and also being near the Arizona State University campus, it can get packed.   I do like that they have a Cane's Club card you can get by going on their website and filling out information. For doing so, you receive a free Chicken Box meal complete with drink, so that's incentive to go back for more and future visits.   I will be back for more visits in the future I'm sure, especially since I have a Cane's Card."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place and can't get enough of it! From their chicken strips to their Texas Toast, to their amazing coleslaw, it's ALL good! Only drawback is it's a little more expensive price-wise for my liking but hey, it's an indulgence, or a treat, when I have it. Love their food, the ambience, and the friendly staff. Once when they forgot something to put my order they just moved me on back through the line so I could get my remaining parts to my order and get me off and running.   If you're looking for a new chicken place, give Raising Cane's a shot."}
{"text":"We went here to grab a quick bite and ordered chicken fingers. It was quite good actually. Not the best I have tasted so far but man, it was quite satisfying. Did good to remove my hunger. The menu was short so there's not much and you don't have to think too hard on what to get. The service here though was kinda slow for me. Must be one of those days. Still, its a good spot."}
{"text":"Yummy chicken!! I love chicken strips but I tend to end up tossing the fries away"}
{"text":"Never super impressed with Canes. I can admit there fingers are fresh from the fryer, however if you're picking up make sure you open your container or poke holes in them so that your chicken doesn't get soggy. I believe they have the best sweet tea that you can buy, lemonade is a bit bitter to me. And of course you have to get the oh so wonderful Texas Toast."}
{"text":"Solid fast food chicken fingers. The dipping sauce along is worth the trip if fingers are what you are after."}
{"text":"I love this shi*. I can't get enough of the Cane's sauce. It's by far my favorite chicken place in LV, Love the crinkle cut fries, and the Texas toast. My girl and I went in and ordered a 3 piece and a 4 piece and we destroyed every bite. It's a very nice price point as well, you definitely don't feel like you're getting ripped off, but you don't feel like you're getting a TON of food for the price. It's about right, at about $13-15 for two people with drinks and taxes depending on what you get. The location is nice, right off of Charleston boulevard and the customer service was friendly, greeting us as we walked in, taking our order with a smile, and getting our food to us fast and accurate. 4 solid stars I'll be back soon, but probably to the one close to the LV outlets, it's much closer."}
{"text":"The drive thru line is painfully slow! I don't understand why this particular Cane's is so slow. Do they make their employees work blindfolded?!"}
{"text":"every vegas trip i went on, i would always see a canes. and i would see a huge line of cars at the drive thru. i finally came and tried this place out recently. now i know what the big hype is all about! the fries are actually good, the garlic bread is pretty awesome. but what takes the cake is the amazing crispy tenders with the cane sauce. their signature sauce is delish! i will definitely be coming back on my next vegas trip."}
{"text":"Love canes every time we have gone there the people who work there are so nice and the food is awesome from the fries to the wonderful chicken omg the only thing is the size of the chicken strips is inconsistent and sometimes they are very small can you fix that please I would recommend this establishment to anyone excellent !!!"}
{"text":"This should be 3 1/2 stars but I'll be nice. Since the chicken with fries and toast are legit and that's really what you're going for, we'll puff it up to 4 stars.  My real gripe with this location is the parking situation. HORRIBLE. The drive-thru line backs up and leaves you stranded in your car if you dare park by the building. So park away from the building!  As far as the food, like I said - it rocks. Good grub and their \"Canes Sauce\"  is bomb. The coleslaw however is WACK. Watery and bland. I always just tell them I don't want it so I don't have to waste food by throwing it away.  The bathrooms at this location are usually dirty due to the dorm-room manners of their ASU patrons and the dorm-room work ethic of their ASU staff. When I bring my kids in for a bite, especially my 3 y/o princess, it sucks to walk into and attempt to help her use a nasty bathroom.  All in all, it's a great place when you're wanting some fried chicken and fries."}
{"text":"First time coming here it was very tasty. I enjoyed the fries the chicken strips and the bread. Sweet he was actually very good. came out and even eight dollars for a four strip meal with a drink."}
{"text":"Guys, your chicken is good but what makes you different is Texas toast with good chicken fingers.  Ordered a Box combo and drove away and 5 minutes later open the box and no freaking toast.  Went there because we were craving the whole combo.  Not worth driving back so forget it.  Very disappointed.  Simple things are what make a meal great."}
{"text":"It's tough to give a fast food joint a high rating but these guys did a nice job.  Really a 3 1/2.  The drive thru was slow because they were making more food.  The chicken strips, fries and bread and were all very good.  Surprised actually.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! Yes food is good but when you have to pay for condiments, then it becomes a joke. In fact a RIP OFF!   .31 Each what a joke!"}
{"text":"My kids love Raising Canes.  We don't eat much fast food but it's always a treat to stop for chicken and the amazing dipping sauce.  They also have fresh lemonade which is a big hit.  I think it's better when you dine it, but it's good when you take it home as well."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in the service I've gotten my past two visits. Both times I've waited in a long drive thru line (the line moved moderately, but that's not the problem) but, when it was my turn to pull up to the microphone to order, no one said anything such as: \"can I take your order?\" or their usual catchphrases!  The first time this happened I waited about a minute and then said... \"umm helllllooo\" I was greeted with a \"what do you want.\" Ummmmm excuse me???? First you're not going to ask what id like to order and then you're gonna get annoyed?The whole time I ordered the girl had a rude/ annoyed tone to her voice. The second time this happened was today and after 30 seconds of no one speaking I just started ordering. I mean come on people???? The crazy thing is both times I could hear them greet the person in front of me and behind me so why ignore me when I pull up? Rediculous! And this time they forgot the extra sauce I asked and paid for. Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Vegas.  My wife's favorite too!!  We are so happy another one opened around the corner from us, i guess that means I'll have to go to the gym more though."}
{"text":"This is a simple chicken strip place, and they have a great recipe along with Texas toast, fries, and sweet tea.  I admit that I have a soft place in my heart for fried chicken, and the reason why I like this place is that they have one main entree and they've got it right.  The place gets a good crowd going constantly; every table was full at 3 pm, which I consider the non-peak hour.  The restaurant is pretty clean, too.  Oh yeah, I like to mix the Louisiana hot sauce (ask for it, it's behind the counter) with the dipping sauce to give it a little zip."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Vegas, I devote one of my lunches to Raising Canes. I also drag my friends to go to Raising Canes and it never disappoints. For the price you pay and for the amount of food you get is unbeatable.   Normally chicken fingers tends to be a little dry, but with Canes, no other chicken fingers compares! The house sauce just puts it over the map with their chicken fingers already freshly made with the right amount of juices. And you can't forget to get their famous sweet tea, it just goes great with the chicken fingers, fries, and bread! I always pack the sweet tea to go and drink it along the day. Talk about a great combo!  They have great employees who are always consistent about cleaning the tables after customers had left. Cashiers are always smiling! Love their service! I will continue to keep coming back here on every Vegas trip."}
{"text":"We live on Tropicana and Decatur so this is the closest Cane's to us. We absolutely love this Cane's. The customer service and the food quality surpasses most food establishments.   Our food always comes out hot and fresh. Not sure how they get the food out so fast because it's always right out of the deep friers. The staff works fast and they are extremely helpful. They don't complain when I ask for things. Especially the Assistant GM Michael, he always has a smile on his face and is ready to help with any problem I might have. Thank you Cane's for treating my family and I so well."}
{"text":"The location is convenient but how the hell are you suppsed to turn into this place coming from the east side....let alone leave the establishment?!?! Being so close to an intersection means the traffic heading east is backed up AT LEAST to this entrance (if not further). Aside from getting here, the food seems fresh and fairly fast when you use the drive-thru. Inside it can be a bit of a stand still."}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of chicken strips because most places make it too dry. This place has made me a fan. Definitely best chicken strips ever and toast! The fries are alright, just regular fries. Oh and you must try the sweet tea!"}
{"text":"If somebody could please explain what the big hooplah is about this place? I have friends that rant and rave about coming here when they visit Las Vegas! I've lived here for about 8 years and have been maybe 3 times! They are extremely overpriced and all for some chicken fingers? The canes sauce is whatever I'm not sure why they glorify this sauce or even the chicken strips! I'm not saying they are nasty I'm just saying that a 6 piece chicken tender meal shouldn't be basically $10! I'd rather spend that at Wing Stop and be on my lucky old way! The fact of the matter is there aren't any flavored you can change to and the sauce options are minimal to none! Only way I'd ever come back is if somebody is paying for me :-)"}
{"text":"i usually write long reviews but all i need to say is once i found this place while living in texas. i went from weighing 220 lbs to 300 lbs. let that sink in on how great this place is!"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's isn't a place that I seek out very often but when I do the experiences are always hit or miss. This particular visit just so happened to be a hit! I came here with my co workers for lunch last week after a meeting. The place itself is very clean and that is important! There is nothing like walking into a fast food place with a dirty lobby and things all over the counters. When we arrived we must've just missed a lunch rush which for us was a plus! The cashiers who took our order were very friendly and moved pretty quick. Dine-In or Take out? We went with the dine-in option being that we still had ample enough time before having to get back to the office. I like the fact that once you place your order you can have a seat and they will actually deliver your food out to you. Should we tip them? Great service! The food of course is always fresh and for my order I didn't want bread so instead I got another Cane's sauce with my 3 piece. Food was great and I was excited to see that my chicken fingers were a decent size. That actually has always been my issue in the past with Raising Cane's. I've received my meals with these puny little chicken fingers and after paying close to $10 for a meal I would still be hungry. Is it hyped? Sure! Will I be back? Sure.. In another 6 months or so..."}
{"text":"Food here is always good, quick, and hot.  My only complaint is they sweep the dining room right around your table while you are eating."}
{"text":"Customer Service is on point! Especially when Zach the manager is around. I always get good service when I eat here!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I'm blessed to have had my first experience at the original location in Baton Rouge, LA...superb! I immediately fell in love. If you love, or even like chicken strips, then Raising Cane's is the place to eat. The chicken strips are crispy, juicy, and pretty much perfect. The fries could use a little work and it's best to eat them while they are fresh. If you have a little ride home, you may want to poke holes in the box because your fries will retain too much moisture and they won't be that good. However, the sauce is the problem solver. I use the sauce on my fries as well as my chicken strips. And my beverage of choice is always the sweet tea...so refreshing =)"}
{"text":"That's some good chicken! Tasty dippin' sauce and love the sweet tea, too.We stop here every time we go through Vegas and never been disappointed. Wish we had Cane's closer to home."}
{"text":"Simply the best fast food chicken fingers around.  Always fresh, hot and juicy chicken.  I love their Cane's sauce, cole slaw and sweet tea.  Also always fresh and delicious.    They have a very limited menu, but they do their thing well.    You can buy a jug of their sweet tea or lemonade to take home too - but it'll cost you and arm and a leg ($7 for sweet tea and $9 for lemonade)."}
{"text":"TL;DR: a great meal, still missing something, repetitive taste  It feels a bit unusual to review a fast food place, but I might as well since there aren't any Cane's in my area. Although Raising Cane's has a reliable list of options and generous serving sizes, their food is missing a little something to making me come all the way down here for it.  I ordered the Box Combo with a Sweet Tea.  BOX COMBO (4/5) - Good amount of food, subbed in extra toast instead of coleslaw - Chicken not as crispy as I would've liked - Fairly repetitive taste throughout - Not a fan of crinkle cut fries, but they're ok  SWEET TEA (5/5) - This is the best ice on the planet, I swear - A great pairing to any meal at RC - Free refills!  So many people have tried to convince me to convert to Cane's, but I just can't go all the way. While it is a great meal, I feel like it's missing a couple things to make it the best, even if I can't put my finger on it. This is the type of place I'd go to if it was in the area, but wouldn't be dying to go to."}
{"text":"So. Good. Don't know what else to say. This place is addicting. So addicting that I'm writing a review for them at 10:23pm when I should be asleep but instead, I'm up, thinking about their food. This location is the best! The food is always fresh and the staff is great. I've been to another location and the fries seemed old, that would never happen here."}
{"text":"This location is always phenomenal! The employees are super nice and helpful, it's always clean inside. The only problem is that they're ALWAYS busy, which doesn't matter cause the food is amazing. Seriously, I've been here after 10 pm and there is still a line. That's what you get for coming to such a great place!"}
{"text":"As a big fan of chicken strips this is a great place to fill that craving.  Although a chain they do a great job as they focus on one things - tasty chicken strips.  They meals are a decent price for what you get.  The service can be spotty at times.  If they are busy they get overwhelmed due the small counter they have.  The inside is nice but when busy can be hectic and messy.  I have never used the drive though as it seems to be a longer wait than going inside.      The chicken strips are good but I will say the breading is on the thick side.  They are medium in size and with the caniac sauce are pretty tasty.   The toast is really tasty and I like the fact it is not overwhelmed with butter.  The crinkly cut fries are ok but could be better.  The cole slaw is pretty good and not the mayonnaise type so it has more of a vinegar flavor which I like.      They have a really good rewards program and send out deals every couple of months.  Well worth signing up for.  Nothing beats a Bogo deal!"}
{"text":"This 4 star rating is really for the establishment that I had visited. It was my first time having Raising Cane's, and walking in reminded me for some reason a very clean and upscale Hardee's restaurant; maybe it's just me. The prices are pretty much the same when comparing the chicken strips to KFC's or even Popeye's Chicken. I do like the soda machine as it has the crunch ice that I like. We ordered 2 Caniac combos which came with 6 strips per combo, fries and toast in one, cole slaw and 2 toast in another. Down side is that they charge you for extra sauce. I can't truly rate the food though as we had it to go and brought it to our hotel. By the time we checked in and settled down, the food was so soggy. Only reason why I ate it was because I was really hungry. The chicken and the sauce had flavor, which really is all I can say for this review. I'll be visiting the location near me in Cali and actually eat it there and rate the food then."}
{"text":"Texas Toast! Texas Toast! Texas Toast!! (oh and the chicken's pretty good too!)   It's a suprisingly yummy alternative from your regular fast food chicken places. Delightfully crisp chicken and wonderfully buttered texas toast. The food came out pretty quick which is a plus.  The sweet tea was yummy. Just the right amount of sweetness.  Sorry KFC but you have another competitor.. cause this place is also finger lickin' good!"}
{"text":"Why am I addicted to this chicken?  I had this chicken years ago and never forgot.  I went again and I had the same feeling.  Now this chain is popping up in San Diego, Costa Mesa, Downey.   It doesn't matter if you walk-in or use the drive-thru - the line is long.  Don't leave the wait is faster than you think.  Your choice is simple: Chicken tenders, Texas bread with coleslaw.  Don't forget the dipping sauce or crack sauce. Don't forget the lemonade.  Oh they give you french fries that are also pretty good!  I am surprised on how hot the chicken is every time!    That's it.  Get ready to plan your return.  I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Food and service is always great and fast! Our whole family loves Cane's and they are usually our go-to place. Drive thru or dine-in the food and service is consistently great!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location they always forget to give me my 4 extra sauces that you have pay for and this was the last time..! Over this place"}
{"text":"Raising Canes is a very tasty and \"more healthy\" alternative to fast food. We went late night about 11:30. The workers were very friendly. Great music was playing. It was very vibrantly decorated and very well lit. We went there straight from the airport so it was a good place to wake up and get a bite to eat.  We each ordered the 3 piece meal which was brought out pretty quickly. The chicken was fantastic. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The dipping sauce was really good. Gave a good twist on standard chicken. Came with some decent crinkle fries and fantastic texas toast. My favorite part of the meal was the sweet tea. I dont usually even like sweet tea but I Loved it at Canes.  A new go to whenever in vegas."}
{"text":"Good chicken fingers, especially for large groups. My friends and I were working a convention near by and the 25 piece meal was the perfect amount for the 6 of us."}
{"text":"Canes has chicken strips like non other so we have to make a stop every time we are in the LV. The customer service is exceptional and accommodating."}
{"text":"I love fast food....I really do.  And this is my favorite chicken finger place...hands down.  They do it right. This Raising Canes restaurant is clean and the staff is nice.  They are helpful and efficient.  If you are unsure what to get, they are quick to answer questions too. So....not a ton of variety at this place.....just get what everyone else is getting...chicken fingers with cole slaw and texas toast.  The chicken fingers are amazing! Crunchy on the outside and tender-soft on the inside.  I can eat many of these....many.  The texas toast and the cole slaw are very good as well.  I always order an arnold palmer because they have good sweet tea and lemonade....it's such a good combination.  Next time your in Vegas try it, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I moved to Vegas 9 months ago... before that, I had never heard of Cane's. I guess you can tell by my number of check-ins, I'm addicted. I always need an extra sauce because that stuff is addicting. I even have the recipe to make my own at home! I take all my out of town visitors here. I love sending them home with the craving so that they have to come back and see me soon."}
{"text":"This is my wife's weekend craving. It's the closest one to Queen Creek.  We take Ray Road all the way down and it's right there.  It's across the street from a cool little store that has great choices for our son with allergies.   Basically, my wife gets a craving for the Canes sauce with the chicken. (Reminds is of Zaxbys from the east coast) And the rest turns into a delightful day of nearby surprises."}
{"text":"Great experience overall. This was our first visit to Cane's and the young man that helped us at the register was friendly, helpful and with a great attitude overall. I will add his name if I find my receipt.  We ended up ordering 3 combos (6 piece) and one sandwich. Those of us that ordered the 6 piece had enough leftovers for a second meal.  It was a little weird that they give you your beverage cup half full of ice already, but that is OK. We asked for hot sauce and got some small packets of Louisiana sauce that were a great addition to the dipping sauces."}
{"text":"I usually like the chicken strips here, but this visit was disappointing.  My food looked fine, but smelled like burnt grease. Guess I got food served from the wrong fryer... everyone else's food smelled just fine."}
{"text":"An absolute craving meal! Have to get Cane's at least a couple times per week.  Tenders are never greasy, the sauce is great; like \"fry sauce\" but much better with a great spice mixture.  Food is always hot and fresh.  If you want a fast drive through, go to McDonalds. Cane's doesn't cook ahead of time, so it takes a few minutes.  I always go inside, the line moves quickly and usually by the time the food is ready there is an open table!"}
{"text":"Mmmm. Mmmm. Mmmm.   That is is the best way to describe Raising Cane's.  This location is top notch as it is extremely busy as well as efficient.   They are amazing at working thru even the longest lines!  I always get a box combo with a freshly squeezed lemonade!  It is the perfect pairing to go with my waffle fries extra Cane's sauce and tenders!  I sometimes get the Caniac combo when I am feel really crazy!"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars all the way!!. We were out in Arizona this past summer and my boyfriend told me about this place and we got food there and I was blown away. It was incredible I love their bread, and the chicken. I kinda wish they have this place in San Diego."}
{"text":"I thought I had this place figured out but...two Caniac Combos is still too much food for 3 people.  We stopped in here and ordered two combos for ~$20 only to leave with leftovers.  If you like Chik fil-A you'll like this place.  Good taste, great service, and even better value for your dollar.  Stop in and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food and great value.  We ordered two Box Combos and a Caniac Combo and it was way too much food for three people.  Wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in and was pleasantly surprised to find large pieces of succulent chicken, texas toast, and cole slaw.  If you're a fan of Chick Fil A you won't be disappointed.  Can't wait for these guys to open a restaurant in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"If you are fond of chicken strips, chicken tenders then this place is for you! They specialize in one thing and one thing only. Chicken! These are boneless chicken breast strips coated and fried crispy. Served with crinkle cut fries, coleslaw, honey toast and their signature sauce. The place is clean and the staff friendly & attentive. After you place your order you can help yourself to the self serve fountain drinks featuring my favorite sweet tea. When your order is ready they bring it to your table! So the next time you're in Vegas give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Busy place for mediocre chicken,  coleslaw was just OK, same as grocery store.  Limpy fries, Wendy's  or BK are better.  Sauce was easy to figure out, any \"special sauce\" is usually ketchup and mayonnaise with some extra seasoning.  In this case a little Cajun seasoning.  KFC extra crispy strips are better and the sides selection better, creaper too."}
{"text":"Decide to try this place and was a bit disappointed that  I waste my time and money on it. I thought it was going to be some spectacular food when it taste no different then chicken strips you would get at Sonic, McDonalds, etc.  Its way OVERPRICED. I wasnt happy that there was only one dipping sauce flavor. It was gross. We also ordered the sandwhich and wasnt too happy it had that sauce spread all over it.  I asked for larger Lemonade and was given a small size.   The coleslaw tasted funny so want fond of that. Only thing I ate was the texas toast and that was pretty weak too."}
{"text":"Yeah... these were pretty good. I grabbed them on the way to a show on the Strip. I could've ate more... but thank god I didn't. I saved some room for a burger later. Wait... that's not a review of this place!"}
{"text":"I can't even begin to explain how tasty the food is here. The cane sauce is too good to be true."}
{"text":"All they have is chicken fingers, but...they are good.   Now I will say when I think good tasty fresh chicken, I think chic Fila.  This was not chic Fila, but...it was a close second.   Their sauce was good.  Their fries were good.  Their prices were great.   I just wish they had other sauce options!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend was super hungry and needed drunk food at like 1am and this place was in the same parking lot as our hotel. So of course we decide to try it. I didnt get anything because I was full. He ordered the meal with 6 or 10 strips?, 2 dips, bread and fries.  He let me try a piece and I ended up stealing 2 pieces of his strips and  a bunch of his fries because they were crinkle cut fries! I love crinkle cut fries and I love their sauce! Their sauce is sooo good. My cousin said their Sweet Tea is really good. I wish I would of got one but there is always next time!"}
{"text":"My go to place for my cheat meal after the gym. I love The Caniac combo which has 6 strips, crinkle cut fries, coleslaw, and toast.  They have the little round ice cubes like sonic burger. Best in your fountain drinks on a hot day. The service is very good for having a all high school aged staff. The food and service is always consistent. Clean dining room area.. Skip the drive thru and come inside it's faster. Only thing I wish is if they had BBQ sauce. They have great fry sauce but I'm a BBQ sauce guy for my strips."}
{"text":"Their food is ok. I mean it's just fried chicken strips bum not going to lie its good but nothing to rave about.   Their customer service is too notch though.   It comes with a piece of toast. I wished that it would have garlic butter on it. If it did then I may have to give it another star."}
{"text":"Very disappointing it took my food about 45 mins to get my food! & i only got a 3 finger combo! :(  food was good though!"}
{"text":"First, let me start by saying I always call the business prior to posting a negative review.  That being said, we decided to stop by this location on Sat May 21st after our kids' football game, around 6:30pm. My stepson loves Cane's and has had it several times in the past. He ordered the 3 finger meal and he was the only one in the family who ordered food from there. Around 10pm he started vomiting multiple times within a very short period, followed by pretty severe GI issues. I think you know what I'm referring to. Poor guy was miserable all night and was in bed most of Sunday and had to miss school today.  When I called on Sunday the girl who answered the phone was very sweet, apologized and asked if I wanted to speak to the GM, so I said sure. I prefaced the conversation by saying that I was not looking for compensation I just wanted to let them know in case they needed to do something procedural on their end, i.e. overseeing food handling practices, etc. The GM was polite but when I told him I didn't want anything just wanted to let them know, I got the impression by his tone that he didn't understand why I was calling and that he did not believe my stepson had gotten sick from there. I asked if they prepare all the food there and he said yes, and that it is \"delivered fresh.\" \"Delivered fresh?\" Oh so you don't order from the salmonella farm? Ok, good to know. Look dude, I don't think anything was done on purpose but my kid did get sick from your chicken, just wanted to let you know so you can step up your practices so someone else doesn't get sick. He offered no apology but asked if I wanted him to notify corporate. If I wanted that I would have contacted them myself.  We will continue to go to Cane's because all of our other experiences have been positive, we just won't go to this one. I've read other reviews on this store and it sounds like they need to step up their quality of food and customer service."}
{"text":"I must admit. I use to sleep on Cane's. Now I have awaken and can't believe that I lived in Vegas for so long and wasn't eaton on these juicy chicken strips!   There's really not much to say that others haven't said already. The menu is very simple. Chicken strips, fries, Texas toast, and coleslaw. The \"sauce\" is hecka good. It's like a spicy thousand island dressing. Smooth all of this down with a good ol sweet tea. Blissfulness."}
{"text":"First timer at the place. Quick service, friendly staff, and clean place.  Simple menu and reasonable prices for a fast food place.  Food came out quick.  Chicken fingers were awesome.  Lightly seasoned breading. Fries were okay, somewhat dry and cold  but not greasy.  Texas toast was great. Sweetened tea was refreshing. Not a huge place and there was plenty of parking.  Located south of the strip on Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"I'm head over heels for these chicken strips. The food always taste fresh. The sauce is delish. The Caniac is our \"go-to\".  The service is accurate, fast and friendly.  On our most recent visit there was a line in the drive thru but we didn't have a long wait. Everything seemed to move seamlessly.  I  Raising Cane's, lol"}
{"text":"Every night I drive by this place and the drive thru line is crazy, like in-n-out burger. So I've been curious about it since it opened a couple of months ago.   My kid fell asleep and I could actually wait in line without her screaming bloody murder. I put on NPR and proceeded to wait 30 minutes just to place my order then another 10 to get my order. I don't mind waiting for good food, but SERIOUSLY PPL?! Greasy chicken tenders and crinkle cut fries?!? Not worth waiting 40 minutes. I prefer chick-fil-a where I can also get spicy chicken and get my food in under 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Waited in drive thru for more than 10 minutes for my food. I wasn't even paying attention quite honestly. But the manager gave me a Free Box Combo voucher for my next visit as an apology for the wait! BOOM!  We need more managers and establishments like Raising Canes in this world. Oh yeah...the chicken is AMAZING...but we already knew that."}
{"text":"This is the place, the place, the place to stuff your face! Hot, crispy, juicy, salty madness! Its the place for fried chicken! Oh and the sauce, get an extra sauce, like a creole sweet mustard with perhaps some mayo in it. Its slatherable love!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. I moved away from Vegas for a couple years and would always miss this place. Cane sauce is amazing! Must try."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers are small and taste ok. Not as crispy as they look in the pictures. They only have one sauce, which is weird for a place that sells chicken fingers. Texas toast tastes pretty bland, coleslaw was gross. French fries were pretty standard. Staff was great though, even though the atmosphere was loud, they yell out your name like a kindergarten teacher taking roll call over a loud class.  No variety on the menu, just chicken fingers.  So if you and each one of your friends are craving only chicken fingers with only Canes special sauce then this is the place for you.   As for me, I'll stick to the 100 other restaurants that have more options, AND chicken fingers."}
{"text":"I can best describe the chicken as \"KFC done right.\" The batter is tasty but not too greasy. The employees have outstanding customer service and regularly ask how everything is. Furthermore the atmosphere is inviting and creates a since of positivity. For a fast-food joint, I really don't see a reason to \"raise Cain.\" This fine place deserves your hunger."}
{"text":"i gave a 3 star rating due to the overall aspect of the restaurant.  the french fries were great as an indulgence of fried food.  the coleslaw was not great, so good thing it was a small portion.  the chicken box was a good portion  with 4 strips, fries, coleslaw and texas toast.  to be honest the chicken was fresh but lacked flavor.. i wish gravy was offered.  it has the potential to be a hot ticket item but needs improvement!!  look at what in and out has done with just burgers!!!!!!  wow !"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me but, I think the fingers are DRY and not very hot  compared to the canes on Las Vegas blvd out by the Belz mall.  And, have alot of kids running the place. It's funny also, I asked for extra dipping sauce and the girl behind the counter goes \"HUH\" I said huh? How about excuse me?  Lol.. Just my 2 cents!  Late."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise. Yelpers are right again!  Delicious fresh hot chicken tenders. The chicken was very tender with a nice crunch from the delicious batter they use.  We got the \"Box Combo\" which included 4 chicken tenders, crinkle fries, cole slaw, Texas toast, their sauce and 22 oz. drink for $7.19. Everything was very fresh and delicious. They keep the menu very simple (no billion things to choose from here!) The drive thru was fast, friendly and efficient. Our food was still hot and fresh even though it took us almost 15 minutes to get our food home."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers were good but everything else was lackluster. The coleslaw was bland and the french fries were terrible. The french fries always get soggy and cold too quick when I eat to go. The last visit they also flat out forgot to provide the Texas toast in both the meals I ordered. I was pretty surprised because I saw the girl at the front counter check the meals before she put them in a bag. The quality needs to be more consist."}
{"text":"Best fast food chicken in Vegas! Love the dipping sauce too. Go through the drive-thru for a special greeting!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better Cane's in the area.  The food is good, and always hot.  Have had bad experiences at other Cane's, but this one has always held up it's quality."}
{"text":"Canes is always good because of the sauce, but this particular establishment has consistently served cold french fries and lukewarm chicken fingers.  I may have even gotten food poisoning from this place (had pei wei on same day so it's hard to tell you).  Live next to ASU, but looks like I'll be eating at the other franchises."}
{"text":"My kiddos love Cane's for its chicken, lemonade, and texas toast! The Cane's sauce is delicious with both the chicken and the fries! Here for a mother daughter lunch date and split a caniac and substituted texas toast for the coleslaw!  The restaurant is clean and bright (I personally don't like dim lit dining rooms) and the staff was super friendly and helpful today!  If looking for good chicken fingers, Raising Cane's is our definite go to."}
{"text":"I live in California, so every time I come to Las Vegas, it's a MUST to stop at raising canes. Every time I come, it's awesome food and great customer service. Alyssa was my cashier and was super friendly and very attentive. She was by herself and had a line almost out the door and she got people their food quick and with a smile, along with mine. I was very happy with the service and the food, love the cane sauce!!! Bathrooms were very clean and so were the tables, can't think of anything that I would or could complain about except the 100 degree temperature outside! Can't wait to be back next month."}
{"text":"Proud to be a Caniac!  \"Where the sauce is the boss and the chicken is king!\" You must order an extra Cane's sauce with every combo.. it's terribly addicting.  And the toast?  Seriously?!  Oh, and don't forget the large sweet tea... oh how sweet it is...   By the way, it also helps with the recovery after a crazy Vegas night ;)"}
{"text":"I love Raising Cane's.  The chicken fingers are really good, and although they are deep fried, they aren't overly greasy.  The fries are clearly frozen, they are good.  And the bread they serve with it is the best and I'm not normally a bread person.  And the service is great.  I love they stay open late, so I can go before work.  The one downside is I'm not a fan of the Cane's Sauce... at all!  As a Texan, you need GRAVY!  And it needs to be cream (white) gravy!  If the Dairy Queen is open, I'll get the chicken fingers from Cane's and I'll go to DQ and get an Orange Julius and some gravy.  LOL.  The price is the best part.  You get a pretty good meal, on the cheap."}
{"text":"I personally think this place is overrated. The chicken fingers are at the most..average. The fries are blah. Coleslaw is fair. Bread is something that I would just as soon toss,than eat. I really can't understand the hype about this place. I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved the chicken and so I am very happy I took the chance and ate here. The service wasn't great very low end but chicken was mouth watering"}
{"text":"The chicken fingers were great! The bread was good and so was the sauce. Highly recommended this place. Just wish they had more locations in California. Staff was super friendly and service was quick for the order."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, service was quick,  and our food was nice and fresh. Food was very tasty, and I like that they bring the food to your table (not many fast food places do this anymore)."}
{"text":"First time and it was pretty good! They are known for their chicken so all the have is chicken nuggets, but they're good! They have this special \"cane\" sauce and it was okay I couldn't quite figure it but but honestly I like chik-fila sauce better! Cool place to try!"}
{"text":"We have had Cane's quite a few times. I like the chicken.  It is less greasy than the \"other\" chicken places. It is enough food and reasonably tasty and priced within our reach. My issue was the chicken tonight.  In the past it has always been tender and juicy. But not tonight. It was rubbery and a little dry.  I have been told that rubbery,  tough chicken is a sign that chicken has been slightly or fully defrosted and then refrozen. Say it ain't so! I will, of course, go back because past experiences have been good, but if I  get a couple more meals like the one tonight I may reconsider."}
{"text":"Great food, sauce is so good. Parking is spread out in halves with drive thru running in between them."}
{"text":"We heard that there was a Raising Cane's near The Strip & we had to go since there are none close to San Diego!  We Uber'd maybe 10 minutes off The Strip to check out this fast food joint.  Their menu is super simple & their speciality is chicken fingers.  The Caniac Combo- 6 Chicken Fingers:  Good for 2 people.  So...  I thought it was just okay.  The batch of chicken I got was dry & barely had any batter to them. Crinkle-Cut Fries: Cane's Sauce:  Tarty & tangy, kind of an odd tasting sauce.  I rather have honey mustard to dip my chicken in. Texas Toast:  Good!  Fluffy & buttered on both sides. Coleslaw:   Large Drink:  Sweet Tea!  Very sweet, very good!  If anything, you must try this!"}
{"text":"Solid chicken and Texas toast.   The fries are standard crinkle fries that get soggy super fast if you get it to go, but the coleslaw isn't half bad. And this is about all they serve. A true one trick pony, even if they do that one trick well.   Service is generally friendly and fast, and prices are reasonably priced.   It doesn't hold a candle to Strip n Dip, but it'll do in a pinch. What's  this obsession  with The Rebels though?"}
{"text":"Out doing errands and saw raising canes in the Yonder. My eyes locked with it and immediately had to have it. This is one place you don't really have to twist someone's arm in order to get them to go with you.  Walked in and every table was taken. Place was pretty slammed. Employees seemed to be handling it well. Restaurant was organized and clean. Manager was easy to spot. I even saw an employee grab a drink for a guest who was handicapped. It was heart warming to see. Everything to the counter, to the drink machine to the restrooms everything was clean.  Took 5 minutes exactly to order and get our food delivered while it was busy. That's great. We ordered the 6 piece platter with extra fries and Texas toast. Oh yeah and sauce :) food was delivered to me by a manager with a smile. Love seeing managers involved.   Chicken was breaded perfectly and chicken was so juicy and flavorful. Fries were crispy but not over cooked. Perfect balance. Sauce is always the best. I don't know what's in it but nom nom. If you know canes and you are still reading this why aren't you in the car already? And if you haven't had it before why are you not in your car already trying it?! :)"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is the best place that you can enjoy amazing fried chicken in Tempe.   The Caniac Combo is the way to go.   The chicken is perfect, fries are awesome, coleslaw tastes great and their special Raising sauce completes it all.   Best place to order food from or enjoy a nice, quick and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Awesome place to come by to pick up chicken tenders. The box meals come with chicken tenders, texas toast, slaw, and fries. If you don't like one of the sides, you can substitute it for another. You cannot however substitute a side for an additional tender... I tried. Each additional tender is $1.29. I am a true fat ass at heart and the box meals here will fill me up. The sweet tea here is pretty amazing. I will usually mix 3/4 unsweetened tea and 1/4 sweetened tea.   I suggest avoiding this place around lunch time. It get slammed with teenie boppers and working professionals. I have been here several times outside of lunch time and it is much quieter."}
{"text":"I assume Raising Cane's is a fast food restaurant chain invented by the parent of a picky child, because this place has basically expanded the kids menu to be the whole restaurant's menu (I immediately clicked the \"good for kids\" button below).  What can you get at Raising Cane's?  Chicken fingers, bread, fries... and not a whole lot else.  But Yelp didn't steer me wrong - these are good chicken fingers!  The breading was super crispy, though a little oily, and the inside was juicy and tender white meat chicken.  They're not small, so a few fingers is probably enough for most people, especially if you order sides.    We got four fingers plus the Texas toast, which was a thick-cut slice of white bread with a garlicky butter spread.  The flavor was good but the bread was sort of soggy and chewy.  The Cane's sauce is a smoky, BBQ, creamy sauce that's meant for the chicken, I guess, but was also tasty on the toast.  I'm not big on fries or coleslaw, so I didn't try them, but this still means I tried half of the menu.  That's sort of crazy when you consider that I only tried three things!  The interior closes pretty early, by my standards, and we were shooed off to the drive-thru by a stern gentleman in a crisp uniform and a beret.  The drive-thru had a long line and moved pretty slowly, though the staff were friendly enough.  I got a kick out of trying this place, but I'm not upset that it's a West Coast chain that I can't get at home."}
{"text":"I neither like, nor dislike chicken fingers.  We heard a lot of hype about raising Canes and thought we'd give it a try.  So first off the chickens fingers are very good, large, tasty and moist.  That's about where it ends, the texas toast was somewhat soggy, the coleslaw lacks much flavor and the frys were not crispy at all.  The frys either need to spend another minute in the fryer or maybe they're turning orders so fast the oil isn't getting to temperature.  As to the lemonade there must be a lemon shortage you could barely taste any lemon in it.  The cane sauce is good.  Not a place we'll go back too, unless we just bought the chicken fingers."}
{"text":"I tried this place last week and almost immediately went back for a second visit.   The food is always fresh.  The chicken strips are juicy and tender. They are not kept under a heat lamp. Fries have been fresh and delicious.    With every meal you get a slice of Texas toast which is delicious along with a side of their signature sauce for your chicken. It's very tasty and completes the meal well. If also suggest you get their fresh sweet tea. It's amazing.   The prices are also reasonable. I would highly suggest a visit."}
{"text":"No sauce selection. Cane's sauce tastes like licking the inside of a pepper shaker. So if you like that, come here. They also have a disco ball, so there's that.  Don't come if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Love this place since they opened years ago! I just don't get by enough. I wouldn't recommend driving far if your taking it with you. .. the fries can get soggy fast. But everything is great when it's hot and fresh. Besides Chick Fil A, this is one of the top 3 places I go to for chicken.   PROS: Chicken              Fries              Sauce              Garlic toast  CONS:  Cooked to order so there is always a wait (not too long but. . .. )"}
{"text":"The food here is do good. It's a large portion for what you pay. The chicken is very most and tender. I would defiantly go back to eat here"}
{"text":"Finally a Cane's on the South side!  If you have been to one Cane's you've been to them all. Lightly breaded chicken fingers, average crinkle cut fries, Texas toast, and Cane's sauce (mayo, ketchup and seasoning). This location is particular is a bit nicer as its in a better part of town and brand new. Service is above average for a fast food restaurant. They are usually pretty busy which means you are getting fresh food but this translates to long waits for drive-thru or dine-in. Overall a pretty good option if you're in the mood for chicken fingers."}
{"text":"What can I say.... it's chicken done right! Try the Cane's sauce, it's great! I am officially a Caniac!"}
{"text":"Yummy.  They don't do a whole bunch of different stuff, but they do good chicken tenders.  They say the meat is never frozen and I don't know what that means, but the tenders come out nice and ummm tender.  The menu is pretty basic but still can be confusing (I don't know why).  Basically, they sell chicken tenders, fries, coleslaw, this great buttered lightly toasted thick bread.  And that's about it.  Oh yeah, and their own ranch style dipping sauce.  I think its good that they stick to one main thing only.  So, what you can order are combinations of the items above.  Nice hello greeting when you enter.  Friendly staff.  They keep the tables fairly clean when it's busy.  They seem to do great business whenever I'm there.  Two side notes: I hope they start opening these in the LA area.  And the bottled water - the bottled water, I don't know what it is, but it's like super cold and good.  Not like too cold it's close to frozen, but cold.  And good (or did I say that already?)."}
{"text":"Fresh food. Long lines but simple menu to pick from. Yummy sauce. Kids love them. The food has been hpt, fresh and taste good."}
{"text":"This is the best sauce for chicken ever!  i wish they would sell it by the gallon!  Always polite staff, restaurant is always clean.  Did I mention that the sauce is the best ever?  Chicken is super tender!  Only thing that could make it better is if they delivered to my lazy A$$!  I heart you!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight at 10:15 pm. I came through the drive thru and ordered two 3 finger combos. When asked if I wanted anything else to order I added two extra sauces. The girl at the drive thru completely ignored what I said and told me my total. I said I don't know if you got my two sauces but ok and drove to the window. She repeated my order to which I added the two sauces (again). The order changed from 13 dollars and some change to 14.35. (Which obviously means she added on the sauces) after correcting her and adding the sauces again she was extremely short with me. Just got home and the dang sauces aren't in the bag and the chicken tenders are really small and overcooked as well as the fries. Really unhappy with this location. The name on the receipt is Camille."}
{"text":"First off I thought this was Popeyes so thats strike one! Next, I ordered popcorn chicken she said \"WHAT?\" Anyway whatever I had to get a family pack and it was way too much food! 28 dollars for one person? WTF? Then I asked how they make the sauce they said they couldn't tell me? Whatever. Anyway, Going to popeyes next time. 1/10"}
{"text":"Fried chicken? Delicious. Fries? Soo good. Sauce? Top Notch.  We quickly swing by this place to pick up some dinner. They literally just serve fried chicken tenders and fries. Simple menu, simple food. It's a little far from the strip of Vegas, we got in before we drove into the strip.  Definitely something you must try!"}
{"text":"Typical Cane's experience.  Currently live in NOLA, so have access to Cane's on a regular basis.  The chicken is okay (some crispy, some parts not as crispy), the fries are good, the sweet tea is great, the coleslaw has crispy lettuce and a great flavor.  But it is the DIPPING SAUCE that does it. THAT SAUCE IS SO GOOD. The TEXAS TOAST is so good. Crispy, buttery, goodness.  Great hangover cure (2nd to pho), and about 1.5 miles down Flamingo so close to the strip if you have a car.  Pro tip: switch out the coleslaw for another Texas Toast if you don't like slaw (or you love the toast)  They bring your meal to you if you dine in. Service (cashier and delivery of food) were not the fastest though.  Added picture"}
{"text":"Was really hoping to find an alternative to my favorite chicken place as I suffer intense guilt every time I go there due to the fact that our \"family values\" are not aligned. Unfortunately, Raising Cane was not the answer.  There is not a single \"healthy\" way to order -- seriously, you can't put something GREEN on the menu? Say, a few strips on a bed of lettuce, as an option?   It's chicken strips, fries, bread and slaw (optional). Period. The only question is a matter of specific quantities. The chicken was good, but not \"as\" good and there is ONE type of sauce for dipping, and I do not care for it.    So, I tried but it looks like I'll still be battling my conscience next time I'm craving a chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Good food but SLOW to get order. If waiting fifteen minutes for fast is acceptable then they need to reevaluate how they do business"}
{"text":"Awesome!  This place has a simple menu and as a result, it's very good at what it does. very very good chicken strips, texas toast, fries, and cole slaw. The \"Cane's sauce\" is amazing. Always really high quality food and great customer service. The fries are just ok, but I'm very very picky about french fries. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in Cane's. I went there expecting something better then KFC. After looking at there web page I thought it looked like a pretty awesome place to try. I went threw the drive thru and place my order - the box combo- and some unsweetened tea. When I got to the window I was greeted by a semi-nervous teen. She reminded me over and over that it was made fresh and that's why it would take a minute.   After repeating how fresh it was I was really excited to sink my teeth into a crispy chicken finger. What I received was 4 soggy pieces of chicken a random piece of bread (not really toasted, and if it was suppose to taste more the just bread it didn't) and crinkle fries that I could have made myself in the oven at home. The chicken's breading was so soggy from being deep fried it came right off the chicken. The only thing that really tasted great was the coleslaw.   I was very disappointed. I would recommend KFC or even the Pool Hall (Silver Q Billiards and Hookah Lounge)  at 67ave and Cactus before I would tell someone to go to Raising Cane's."}
{"text":"Omg this is the second time I have been to this location and my third time to a raising cane:))) Very consistent with the service, quality of food and the personnel working at the establishment...Tyrus is such a sweetheart from greeting us, explaining the different options we could have, serving us our meals and cleaning of the tables around the dining area!!!!job well done Tyrus  and thank you for working so hard :))) Raising Cane, u guys know what customers want and the price to quality and quantity of food ratio is the best I have seen in my life!!!! Wish u guys could come to San Diego or the Bay Area...Irvine is the closest to our home but today is the first for my daughter :)))) Such a fine establishment:)))))"}
{"text":"It's always good. I love the Texas toast garlic bread stuff and the sauce. I could leave the chicken. Lol! Fast service, hot food etc.   Very consistent. I eat here 3/4 times a year. I use to way here a lot more when I first hear about it years ago. I try to make better choices but, they were closed :)   It's okay ... I like it a lot."}
{"text":"I will always be addicted Raising Cane's food, especially their house sauce. Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place everytime I crave fried chicken. I did today too. Reached the place a little after 12 (closing time on Wednesdays) and noticed that the doors were locked, so I went through the drive thru. The order was placed quickly and while picking up, the guy asked me to wait in the front as I was on a bike and he wanted to close shop. I waited for 10 mins in the front and tried going through the front door which was locked, none of the employees were bothered to check on me and were busy packing up. I finally had to bang on the window on drive thru (one employee who noticed me first just mouthed 'we are closed' and walked away), when I finally got the order from the guy who told me to wait in the front, he forgot to put in the ketchup.   Such a bad experience and I'm never going back. I'm gonna go to chick-fil-a henceforth."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times. Come to think of it, this may be the only Cane's location I have been to. We decided on Cane's prior to leaving the house and drove by a few other food joints to get there.  The line at the drive-thru was long, but we were determined and before you knew it, we were boxed in and couldn't  bail out if we wanted too anyway. The line went surprisingly quick and the order was spot on, even down to the extra Cane's sauce. Everything was what you would expect from Cane's. The bread was hot and fresh as were the fingers and fries. The iced tea was refreshing, both sweet and unsweetened, and the ice is some of the coolest around."}
{"text":"Not as long of a wait as I was expecting. When I drive by it's usually packed. Nice and quick late night stop. Can never go wrong with chicken!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Cane's! If you guys meet Leo working at the register you will get great friendly service and great hospitality! Food is delicious as always!"}
{"text":"I like chicken fingers and that's a good thing, because that's pretty much all they sell here. When you pretty much only sell one product you better be good at it, and I felt they were. The breading on the chicken was of a medium thickness I would say. You can either use their house made sauce or they have honey mustard. I do wish they had a sauce bar where you could choose from lots of different sauces. Fries were OK, but nothing special. They also have coleslaw, but I opted for extra fries in place of the coleslaw. In addition to soda, they do also offer both tea and sweet tea. I wish we had one of these back home as my boys would love it."}
{"text":"Cane's is the go to when you're hungry for fast food that isn't a burger. They have quick service and the Cane's sauce is amazing!! No matter what combination you get of the chicken fingers, you're never disappointed and you never walk away with an unsatisfied stomach. I personally like switching out the coleslaw for the toast because their Texas Toast is so delicious but some people prefer the coleslaw. The sweet iced tea is really good as well and comes with most of the combos. It's really sweet so I like mixing mine with a little bit of the unsweet iced tea but that's up to you to decide if you like that over a fountain soda! Quick, easy, delicious, and fairly cheap!"}
{"text":"A fast food review... GOOD FAST FOOD.  I honestly try to stay clear of places with drive thrus, but you can't pass up regional fast food that doesn't exist in your neck of the woods.  This chain only serves \"chicken fingers\" and its mainly based out of the south. The two closest to the west coast are both located in Vegas. They boast of the \"fresh, never frozen\" deal, and you can totally tell.  The chicken strips really taste homemade, the white meat is juicy and the chicken is dipped in batter by hand. They cook them to order so the strips come out fresh, hot, and crispy, seriously like they were made in someone's kitchen. The menu is limited (they focus on the chicken fingers) and meals come with crinkle fries, texas toast, and their signature dipping sauce."}
{"text":"so this has always been one of my favorite places to eat chicken and it seems that lately every time i go it just gets worse and worse, but i was here two nights ago and i came threw drive thru with my sister and we each got our normal box combo. so we were excited to bring it home and dig in:) but once we stared eating it something was just not right, the fries tasted old and the chicken tasted totally different almost as if our food was reheated or food from earlier that wasn't sold earlier and given to us, it didn't taste fresh at all, and we live close so its not like it was a long drive, this is the third time in a row i have not been satisfied there, i don't think we will be back in a while, or maybe just try another location."}
{"text":"They use chicken tenders for their pieces! Flavorful breeding and not too thick. Chicken tenders were tender indeed and not stringy. Would come back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend keeps bragging about this place. We're from Chicago but she said this is must see place. Great dining, peaceful environment and music. Although Canes only sells chicken fingers its quite delicious along with the fries and garlic bread. They have a special sauce that's pretty good. It would be nice if they offered a variety of flavors. They are opening one in Chicago which are excited to see."}
{"text":"Talk about another fast food joint that sits on the same tier as In N Out in terms of being able to consistently push out good eats and at a fair price.  The simple menu probably doesn't hurt their success either. Perfect one thing and let them come to you."}
{"text":"Always been my favorite when it comes to chicken fingers! People here are not too friendly. You just come and go, but the quality of food is awesome! I did get my rewards card but i dnt think it does anything! They gave me FREE DRINK on my birthday which was weird and not useful since i always get caniac combo which already comes with a drink, but still i love RAISING CANES!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving some chicken fingers, french fries, Texas toast, and sweet tea I come here!  This location is especially busy during lunchtime, but service through their drive through is quick, customer service is great, and I have placed a multitude of orders from a single box meal to large office orders to feed an army and have never been disappointed.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Canes. Their sauce is what really sets them apart. It is peppery, tangy, and delicious. Their chicken is crispy, piping hot, and beyond moist every time. Their fries are even good and I don't like wavy fries. Oh! And the bread is so good. It is buttery and topped with sesame seeds. This is my go to place for chicken fingers. I have also noticed the staff are always friendly and polite. They welcome you as you walk in the door and always start up a conversation. The three finger box is enough for one person easily and you're only spending about $7.   Note: The hand made lemonade is delicious as well but no refills and is more expensive then a regular fountain drink."}
{"text":"The DEA should plan an undercover sting operation there, because whatever substance they use for the batter must certainly be illegal in the 50 states and territories. That is some potently addictive tasty chicken they serve there. The inside is juicy and tender due most likely to a phenomenal brining method, but the fried batter is what stands out. Surprisingly still light and not overly greasy.  The side sauce option is good, but in my personal opinion not what makes Cane's an outstanding fast food option.  As for the rest of the sides on the menu: Greasy carbs, fried carbs and fatty greens (Toasted Texas Toasts, french fries and coleslaw). I usually skip the sides in fear of turning to carbs myself. It is just too much of it.  If you go for a side, the Toast are good but maybe too greasy when already eating fried chicken. Fries are actually not too bad, but Cane's will never win \"Best Fries\" award. Cole slaw is better than KFC (I know. Why make a comparison to something not worth it).  As for service, the staff is always very courteous, friendly and thorough (Even though in the past they forgot 1 of my chicken fingers on a drive-thru run).  Note to any federal agency conducting an investigation into the goodness of those fingers: I'll be happy to watch over the seized evidences. It'll be perfectly safe."}
{"text":"SO LET ME TELL YOU ALL!!! First time ever to Cane's and honestly the best freaking chicken food ever!!!!! I love their set up and the staff is so so so so so friendly! Clif honestly hooked it up for it being my first time! The food was and is great, the staff is all pure and sweet, and just the entire experience was excellent! Thank you Cane's but especially Clif!!!!"}
{"text":"Do not go to this location. They have really bad service. I tried to use my rewards card for a meal and they would not let me use it. Then once I got to the drive up window, I asked for more Cane's sauce. The woman named Ana Q. Prepared the sauce and then before dropping it in the bag said that'll be $1.30. I said are you kidding? She said no! Then I explained I just went to the location on Stephanie last night and got 3 extra cane's sauce at no additional price. She said well I don't run that location, I run this one and we charge at this location. Needless to say don't go to this location. After running your card once the last thing you want to do at a drive up window is run the card again for a SMALL fee of $1.30. This is very inconvenient!"}
{"text":"I must say people do makes the  difference excellent food but I did appreciate Bobbie he was my server and he was very patient and attentive when ordering.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Ive been coming to canes for years now ! It's so good every time. I always get an extra sauce and toast buttered on both sides. I always take my friends and family here if they're from out of town because they don't have it in a lot of other states yet."}
{"text":"The food here really sets itself apart from all the other fast food chains. Raising Cane's is like In-N-Out in the chicken fast food world. YUM!"}
{"text":"If you're craving chicken fingers and fries this is the place to go! Their chicken is tender and crispy and I love the dipping sauce that comes with the meal. The meal also comes with a side of garlic bread which is kinda odd to be served with chicken but it's so tasty that I can't complain. One thing that I would recommend is to eat at the place rather then taking it to go. The food tastes fresh and the chicken and fries are crispy .when you take it to go, the chicken and fries get soggy. Overall the food tastes great and their customer service is good!"}
{"text":"We attended a JDRF event at Sloan Park in Mesa and Raising Canes was a sponsor and had a tent at the event.  My daughter and I have wanted to try this new restaurant.   We met Christopher at the event and he was so friendly and offered us a meal to come in and try their food.  So we did, we arrived after lunch and they were so busy, we talked to the manager Mel and she took care of our meal, just as offered. Thank you to all the friendly staff and the excellent food. But especially for sponsoring the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation walk on Saturday in Mesa.  We will definitely be back as our meals were great and your support means even more!"}
{"text":"Ordered a 10 piece and ended up with 9 but half of them were little bits with not much meat. Not excited about driving home and noticing there was food missing. They usually have it together but guess they were too busy to notice."}
{"text":"I like to order from here when we are treating our staff to lunch. They always answer the phone fast and have the food ready by the time they say it will be ready considering we always order for about 15people sometimes more.  They are friendly and the food always tastes perfect."}
{"text":"If i could give this place 0 stars I would. Worst customer service. Worst management ever. Ordered food for dine in. The Girl cashier who rings me up brings out our food andcalls my name (Shane) I say, Over here! With my hand raised and she gives our food to a table of 3 girls and a guy who clearly did not order our food. So I go up and tell them they just got our food, for free. And kindly asked them to put the money back on my card that they gave them our food for free when I raised my hand and yelled over here! The guy manager turns to cashier and asks so do I give them food or not? She says I guess not. And I ask to speak to the manager and he says \"Oh I am the manager\" Isaid wow. When you have to ask your cashier how to incorrectly do your job you sir are NOT a manager. Any manager would have fixed the problem and taken care of the issue at hand. Not been a complete d*ck about it. Will never step foot into this location ever again. Raising canes is one of my favorite places to eat but this location is ran by complete trash."}
{"text":"I mean, what can I say, this is every child's dream restaurant and now as an adult, I get to enjoy it whenever I want.  I know we all remember going through that phase where we ordered chicken fingers and french fries at every single restaurant, regardless the time of day. Well I'm guessing the people who created Cane's all lived through that phase and didn't want to get out of it.  The menu is simple... how many chicken fingers will satisfy your craving? I'm always good with 3 crispy and juicy chicken fingers, hot and crispy crinkle-cut french fries, soft and buttery Texas Toast, and half sweet-half unsweet iced tea with crushed ice.   But wait, there's more!!! Their dipping sauce is to die for. You know when your mom used to mix together ketchup and mayonnaise and call it a new sauce? Well Canes basically did that, put sprinkled in a whole bunch of black pepper and magic and BOOM! The perfect sauce to complement their perfect chicken fingers.  But hey, don't take my word... try it yourself!"}
{"text":"The line for drive thru was tragically long here on a Friday night but it flowed incredibly fast!  The two employees I interacted with were both courteous, smiled warmly and very professional for a fast food establishment.  I ordered the Caniac which came with Texas toast, 6 chicken tenders, coleslaw, a large drink and a dipping sauce.  I requested extra fries in lieu of the slaw which worked out great as I split the meal with my friend. The chicken tenders had a great flavor and texture and the dipping sauce was delicious!  The fries were basic, I'm not a fan of the crinkle cut, I wouldn't mind seeing another choice made available.  All in all, it was a good meal and the food stayed nice and hot by the time I got home 10 minutes later.  I would definitely return in the future for those fingers!"}
{"text":"Food is great, but my sister found a hair in her food. It's no wonder though. They don't wear their hair in proper buns. Their hair is in ponytails but completely loose."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE RAISING CANES!  That should be the entire review but it can't be.  I think I've already done the other Cane's reviews so I must do this one as well.  Raisin' Canes is a lot like In-n-Out in that they keep things simple and they always do it right!  I've never once had a bad experience at any Canes and they have never once messed up my order.  Their food is phenomenal because they have just basically 1 item on their menu...Chicken Strips (not entirely true, I think they have a chicken sandwich as well).  Everything is made fresh and is never frozen and every time I take a friend there from out of town, they go bananas for it and demand to go the next time they're in town!  The great food is followed by great service which, the two, hand in hand can be hard to come by these days.  They're always fast and friendly and even one time when I had a gift card but gave them my Raisin Canes card and they couldn't pull up my free meal, I was getting upset cuz I (the idiot) thought I was wrong and they were messing up, and they never once seem frustrated with me or upset.  It's just a great atmosphere at Cane's and I love going there."}
{"text":"Some of my black friends recommended this place to me (true story, my black friends love chicken), so it's been on my list of \"places to check out\" for a few months.  Did the drive through thing, got the chicken strip sandwich / fries / lemonade combo.  The chicken strips were moist and crispy, quite tasty.  The Cane sauce had good flavor, but since they wanted to charge me an additional 35 cents for sauce, the sandwich was kind of dry (just chicken, sauce, lettuce & bun).  The fries were crinkle cut, and soggy.  The \"fresh squeezed\" lemonade tasted like Country Time and the service was less than personable or stellar.  So, if you are JUST going to get some tasty chicken, this place is nice and at least they don't hate gay people.  Outside of that, nothing you need to check out."}
{"text":"I was charged for a caniac combo and when I got home. I only had four pieces of chicken and cane sauce spilt everywhere with cold fries.I understand they were busy but that's not what I paid for very Disappointing"}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up some drive through the other day.  The staff was above and beyond the most friendliest.  I was very impressed with them."}
{"text":"I love Raising Cane's!!!!   The chicken is so tender and the batter for it is delish. The toast is oh so good. And the sauce is freakin CRACK SAUCE!!! The fries is good but it's fries. Now when you dip it into the crack sauce oh then it's a whole new world.. Especially the chicken and toast. OK all three of them toast, chicken and sauce are CRACK.  It makes you want to go back for more. Just dip all of them into the sauce and hope they give you extra sauce. If not I'm sure you can purchase it. I just wish the chicken was a bit bigger or man I think they need to give more. LOL   But hey if your in Vegas or TX hope you stop by RC and if you love some chicken. I'm sure the sweet tea is good but I'm not a tea kinda person unless it's with some small finger sammie.   OH yeah this location is great and has friendly people.  They are fast and efficient."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many, many, many times. Since sophomore year in high school. I've always had the greatest customer service and had qualify fast-food there. Their great service and welcoming staff literary makes you to go there more often.   Tonight, around 11 pm, my friend and I went and used the the drive thru to order our foods. We sat outside as they only serve through drive thru.  Food was delicious, well tendered (as always), and we both enjoyed it.   After finishing our food, we went for a refill through the drive thru as the main doors were closed. The shift leader (night time) refused to give us a refill. She mentioned taking our used cups would violate their policy. After pausing for a few seconds, we said okay fine. Let us come inside and get a refill ourselves.   She gave us a rude look, as if we owe her something and slammed the window on us. We were absolutely shocked. Simply couldn't believe  what just happened.   I understand people are tired, especially at late night and want to clock out. As a business owner now, I once worked fast-food and thoroughly understand the ins and outs of the business. I tell my employees customers are building blocks of every business. A successful business is always tailored around great customer service.   This will be my last visit to this location."}
{"text":"The best chicken tenders I've had in my life! I've never been inside, I don't know what it costs, a friend brings it over occasionally. They taste a little like KFC, but they don't have all those spices. They don't use much salt, which I like a lot. The breading is light, not greasy, very tender. If I didn't know it was a fast food chain, I would swear it was an appetizer from a nice restaurant. I mean the fries are a little fast food-ish, but the chicken amazing. I would not mind eating this chicken every day."}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes, Raising Cane's is top notch. Like In-n-Out, Raising Cane's bolsters a simplistic menu based solely around chicken fingers. Side items include coleslaw, krinkle-cut french fries, and Texas toast. Coleslaw I have never been a fan of, so I typically replace mine with another Texas toast (at no extra charge!) which I absolutely adore. The french fries I am not a huge fan of due to their style. They remind me of the frozen Ore Ida fries I used to eat as a child. The lead singer of this band, the superstar, the show stopper, has to be their signature Cane's sauce. This stuff is the nectar of gods. I have seen some other reviews from this location describe the sauce as 'Crack Sauce', and that is an extremely apt assessment. Wash it all down with a deliciously sweet and satisfying sweet-tea or homemade lemonade and you are good to go my friend."}
{"text":"I am a bit of a chicke finger connoisseur. In my humble opinion this is the best chicken finger specific joint in the country. Chicken is fresh, breading isn't too substantial, sauces are homemade and fresh, garlic bread is great compliment,  and the krinkle cut fries are excellent. If i have one complaint it is they don't have BBQ sauce. Luckily the sauces they do have are outstanding. Any city my wife and I visit that has a Cane's it is a requirement that we visit!"}
{"text":"Arnold Palmers with southern-style sweet tea? Check!  Dog treats given out in the drive-through when they see a furball in the car? Yes! Amusing, if cheesy, welcomes to the restaurant?  Indeed! Pleasant staff?  Yep!  Tasty food at reasonable prices?  That too!  When I'm not feeling up to cooking, this is my go-to place for sure."}
{"text":"Always grab the box meal. I switch out the toast for the extra bread sometimes :) I'm a fatty lol. But I have to say there chicken fingers are amazing!! Just love the consultancy of this store.   Line in the drive thru moves quick even when it's all made fresh. I always grab a sweet tea cause for some reason it's freaking amazing there.  Will definitely keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"The BEST Chicken EVER.   Seriously. And I'm the person that orders fried chicken at a burger place. I love chicken and I can't even explain how badly I miss and crave Cane's since I graduated and left Tempe.   This location is always clean, the staff is so nice, its huge and even on crowded days I've always found somewhere to sit. They get you your food out pretty quickly and its always hot and fresh. I love that they have sweet tea. Their Cane's sauce is awesome. I just love love love this place.   If you don't want chicken, or have a lame-o in your group who doesn't want chicken, then don't come here. They really only sell chicken, but they've definitely perfected the craft and I wish they'd put a location in Utah."}
{"text":"I love rising canes! Best lemonade !! The food always comes out fresh and they always have a great attitude!"}
{"text":"I always get excellent service at Canes and I've never had a problem with my order, ever, and I've been probably around 100 times. Love the chicken, fries, and bread! Always get a Box Combo and replace the Cole Slaw with extra bread and I love it! Love this place, I'll always come back no matter where it is"}
{"text":"I already love Canes, but this location is my absolute favorite. Went today for the first time in a couple weeks while I was in town, and Sierra was doing the drive thru and did an amazing job! Last time I went, Lauren served me and the service was amazing! Couldn't complain about anything, and the food tasted great! Love Raising Canes!"}
{"text":"A couple of months ago, my friend who lives in Henderson texts me and asks if I've tried a restaurant called Raising Cane's that specializes in serving chicken finger/strips? My very first thought was, \"Just chicken strips?\" I don't know why I thought that because when I go to Chick Fil A that's pretty much just what I get, just the chicken strips and waffle fries of course. It turns out the only Cane's locations in CA right now are in Orange County which is a 45 minute drive all the way from Hollywood without traffic so that pretty much ruled it out for me.  Fast forward to Thanksgiving day. On a spur of the moment I decide to drive out to Henderson to visit my friend and his family and as I'm leaving to drive back to L.A. the next day. I see this Cane's location and think let's give this place a go.  Initial impression: Easy access, plenty of parking and the place looks nice and clean from the outside. When I walked in, I noticed that there was a good amount of people in the dining area and I was immediately welcomed and greeted by a cheerful young woman who's cleaning some tables. Being that this is my first time at the restaurant I was hoping to sit back for a little bit and scan over the menu but the young lady that had greeted me goes to a register and is ready to take my order.   I wanted to just get the chicken fingers since it was a long drive back and I didn't want to fill up on other food and drink, but from what I could see on the menu board, everything is put together as a meal which includes, fries, cole slaw and a slice of Texas toast. The cashier recommended 'The Box' which was a 4 piece meal and since I didn't even know how big the strips actually were I just followed along and went with it. Just like at Chick Fil A, the cashier gets your name but oddly enough, there was no one calling out when the order was ready and they didn't give me a number marker or anything to take to the table so it worried me little bit because I was thinking, \"How would they know whose order is whose especially if the names are the same?\" What ended up happening is the cashier that took my order also brought my order to my seat. Impressive personal service!   Food: The chicken fingers/strips are a pretty good size pieces that look like they're battered KFC extra crispy chicken style. If you put two of them together, that's almost the size of what you would find in a chicken sandwich at most restaurants, so getting a four piece meal is a good amount of food. Apparently, the chicken is fresh, not frozen and all orders are fried up to order so no sitting under the heat lamp deals going on here which they could have easily done since all they are preparing are chicken strips. Upon the first bite without any of their special sauce, I could tell that this was a high quality fast food place because the chicken was so juicy and tender! After that first bite I used the sauce and it was a great compliment. The sauce is basically mayonnaise based with a bit of garlic and other spices to give it a unique tang. Very tasty!   When it came down to the fries, cole slaw and toast, they all stood out well on their own and since they're always included, you're never going to go wrong with having them as part of the meal.    Service: One of the things that stood out to me was being cheerfully greeted as I came into the establishment. A great way to set the tone and atmosphere. I also noticed that the restaurant was really kept up well and very clean and that includes the bathroom. I remember as I was eating two of the employees were challenging one another in a fun way as to see who would be first to clean a table off as soon as a customer finished their meal. That's a positive reflection on management and motivation of the people working their vs at places like McDonald's where a lot of employees I come in contact with give off the vibe that they're hating their job and just going through the motions.   Conclusion: So it turns out I ended up traveling all the way to Henderson vs Orange County to try Raising Cane's for the first time and I was not disappointed. If they had one near Hollywood, it would be fifty fifty between them and Chick Fil A when it comes down to getting a meal of fast food chicken. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"These are some damn fine chicken fingers.  And the Texas toast, my god the toast!! I'd never heard of a Raising Cane's before, but I turned to yelp looking for a dinner option the other night and now I'm hooked.  The chicken is moist and delicious. Some of the best chicken fingers I've ever had really.  The Texas toast, meanwhile, is just amazing.  Growing up in the midwest, this used to be something that was often served as a side at a lot of different restaurants, and it was a nice blast from the past to find that here.  Cole slaw and chips were awesome as well.  This was a great find and it seems likely that I'll be back often going forwards."}
{"text":"Love Raising Cane's. We eat here at least once a week. On a road trip to San Diego my 4 year old wanted chicken & french fries. So we stopped by McDonald's, he saw their nuggets and said no, not this chicken, the other one. Lol."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Cane's! In my opinion it is complete worth the drive! Always get hot fresh food. And I'm not sure what all they put in the Cane's sauce but it is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Vegas, I find such great food and Raising Cane's is the newest of my finds. Had to go to Target and found this chicken finger gem. If you are a chicken finger person, you will be hard pressed to find better for a fast food joint!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place when I was watching a TV show about CEO's who go undercover to do go deeds (no...it wasn't Undercover Boss). The Raising Cane's CEO/creator and his wife went down to Louisiana to see where some of their fortune could help out. I thought that was pretty cool even if it was for publicity. So I thought I would give it a whirl.   My monkeys, mom and myself all rolled in and each ordered a combo (I think I got the box lunch and my mom got the smallest one). Oh Dear Lord! The strips were soft, the fries were crinkle cut and perfectly crispy (just like I like them), the cole slaw wasn't too soupy, the Texas toast melted in my mouth and THE SAUCE. Their sauce should be a 5th food group. I put it on everything (strips, toast, fries, fingers).   Their sweet tea and lemonade are quite tasty as well and very refreshing. Will be a loyal patron of Raising Canes because of their genuinely friendly service, great food and nice place for kids."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken fingers and sauce!!!  I'm a transplant from the Southeast and had really been missing the chicken finger joints like Zaxby's and Guthrie's in Florida and Georgia with their perfectly cooked chicken fingers, special sauce, crinkle fries, and texas toast.  Raising Cane's serves it up just like those joints.  Fresh, hot, and delicious.  If you don't like chicken fingers, this place is not for you.  It's all they do.  Their tiny menu consists of box combos with either 3, 4, or 6 fingers, or a 3-finger sandwich, along with fries, texas toast, and Cane's sauce.  You get coleslaw with the 4 and 6 finger boxes. They have no other dipping sauces, just Cane's sauce, a peppery mayo-based sauce.  Oh so delicious!  And they have great sweet iced tea!  Always a plus in my book.  4 stars!"}
{"text":"Raising Cain's, especially this location, right off the strip, is excellent. Top tier fast food. Cane's is encroaching on sit down restaurant territory here. Everything is always fresh, and tasty. The location is very easy to get to, and the place is always hoppin. An empty restaurant is something you want to avoid. That's a red flag that somethings wrong, but that's never the case here. The best comfort food!"}
{"text":"Sad to say ordered caniac its like they picked smallest chicken pieces and put it on my plate and ordered extra fries and its like they split 1 order of fries and put in two plates 1st bad experience out of all the time I've been going to this place"}
{"text":"Winner winner chicken dinner! The BEST fast stop chicken fingers everrr. It's always a must when we're visiting from Hawaii. Knocked off a star due to them forgetting another one of our orders a few days ago. And to be fair, they did that to us the last time we were here too at this same location lol! But whenever we've called to let them know hey you guys forgot an order, the manager (Bill in this case) is always very friendly and always says to come back for it whenever we're ready. I just hope they stop forgetting haha we love our chicken there!"}
{"text":"Very very fresh all the time. There is always a line here. The service is fast and great, and everything they give always tastes so good! Definitely satisfies your fried foods cravings. :)"}
{"text":"I don't get it. I'm a chicken strips fiend and this was average at best. \"Texas toast\"=Hawaiian sweet bread. Sweet tea=Lipton w/sugar. I was so excited, not to mention, very full from a heavy lunch. But I had to have it. I had to experience what all the hype was about. Alas, I learned it was just that. Hype. It's ah-ight. But I wouldn't go there again. Yes, the chicken was moist breast meat, but the batter, which should have been crispy, was soggy, crumbly and surprisingly flavorless. The magic sauce that everyone raves about? It was some mayo-like, chipotle concoction that added nothing to the overall strip. Even the fries where nothing to write home about. The Texas toast brought back memories of eating at the Sizzler as a child. It was squishy, buttery and toasted and the best thing I had here. So disappointed."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here and I just liked it! I sometimes buy and enjoy four chicken fingers combo at home when I do not wanna cook. Personally, I like their coleslaw and the small piece of bread. Also the staffs are friendly. Can't wait to stop by again!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is always good and freshly made. Workers are courteous. Would've gotten 5 stars but tables were not cleaned as efficiently as they should be in terms of being readily available and I don't like being asked if I want to give a donation. Kinda cheesy! Over all tho; good place to pick up a quick bite to eat! Chicken strips are good and I love their ice tea!"}
{"text":"Cane's Sauce, chicken strips, texas toast, fries, and sweet tea..That's basically all you really need right there! Every thing is so delicious and satisfying that it'll make you want to crave for more!! I usually like to get the Caniac box so that i have left over's for later and it's just like having two 3 finger combo's in one.  I really can't express how good their food is all through words so I suggest you take my word for it and try it! It will definitely not disappoint!   Gosh, I wish I had some right now... LOL"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Their food is great! The dipping sauce is awesome! If you're looking for some great chicken tenders, this is the spot!:)"}
{"text":"The sweet tea here is bomb! I think that's probably one of the best thing about this place. Chicken is not bad either. lol. I got a chicken tender with fries and it fills you up. No complaints here. They are crispy and not too salty or dry. This place is mostly filled with college student since it's right next to ASU and it does get pretty busy so watch out for that. Not bad for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered Cane's from DoorDash, an online service that assigns people to deliver food to your door. This location is nearest to me. DoorDash never came through and I tried to contact them to no avail. I went in myself about 30 minutes after my expected delivery time and told the manager what happened. Even though they had no affiliation with DoorDash and it wasn't their fault, they comped my order and it was done in less than a minute and I was out. I was so impressed! They didn't have to do that at all. Really nice of them."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers, ever! Great Texas Toast. Droopy and pathetic french fries. Sounds like I need to try the sweet tea!"}
{"text":"my girl arleevia was EXCEPTIONAL at customer service and was a great cashier and provided and fun and delightful lunch atmosphere, she deserves a raise beyond no other...truly a queen for the people, keep hiring those great workers @ canes, xoxo, @blessedburrito and @coco.chris"}
{"text":"I LOVE chicken.  It's one of my favorite foods, especially chicken fingers.  We were in Vegas for a birthday, and the birthday boy had another friend pick up a dinner box from Raising Cane's for him before we went out to the club that night.  Since I love chicken I asked if I could have a piece just to try.  I ate it plain, I usually don't put a lot of sauces on my chicken fingers.  I would have to say it was ok, and I was really buzzed when I took a bite.  So the next day, I'm still craving chicken.  We decide to go to Raising Cane's again, but we will eat there.  We went there and the line was pretty long for a fast food restaurant and the dining room wasn't the biggest (maybe sitting 30 people), so we tried to decide which meal to get, our group was six people, thinking the tailgate would be enough.  After more thinking, we just decided to get our own meals.  I shared with my bf, I forgot which size we got but I ate about three chicken fingers.  I would have to say it tasted better than the night before, plus I tried it with the Cajun dipping sauce each platter comes with, I liked it.  The sauce was a mayo base with Cajun spices mixed it with it, simple one may think, but it's what made the chicken taste even better.  The fries that came with the meal were decent and didn't outshine the chicken.  I didn't eat the cole slaw, I don't like it, but my bf did and he thought it was one of the best he has had.  I took a nibble on the toast but all I couldn't anything on it.  And the sweet tea wasn't bad either.  Not too sweet, not too bitter.  I will totally come here again, but will not get it to go because it tastes a lot better at the restaurant than eating at the comforts of your hotel room.  There are other Raising Cane's in the area too.  I think many of them are build ab round major colleges, this one near UNLV.  So if you like Louisiana-style fried chicken finger or get sick of eating a buffets in Vegas go to Raising Cane's."}
{"text":"On a recent Vegas trip with my friends, we all got to select an activity that everyone must go to or do.  Mine was to go to Raising Cane's because I like chicken fingers and the last time I had them was over a year ago.    This Raising Cane's is located at the Las Vegas Outlets, so you can only imagine how crowded and busy it can be.  And if you think the one on Flamingo is a better bet, think again, it's just as crowded. We came during the lunch rush, it was also Labor Day too.  They also happened to have an event going on, a race car driver was there and they had a giveaway for a ride in his car.  I shared with my boyfriend, we ordered the Caniac which is 6 chicken fingers, Texas toast, coleslaw, fries, and a drink. Just as I remember it, tender and juicy.  As some may have said before, be careful on the first bite, these things are HOT, not spicy but temperature.  I think they cook the chicken to order.  I really like the sauce, it's peppery with the right amount of tangy-ness.  I think that's the whole reason I go!  If you haven't tried the sauce you should, because I didn't at first and didn't like the chicken, but the combo with together it tastes amazing!  The fries are standard, tastes like the Ore-ida brand.  If you like sweet tea, the sweet tea is good, especially with during the hot Vegas weather.  I like that they service the drink with crushed ice, I like it better than the cubes.  Personally, I don't like the toast, I feel it needs something else.  Maybe next time, I'll spend the sauce on it to see how it tastes, maybe that's what it needs.  Enough of this fatass talk...  The service is good, everyone there is so nice.  You get greeted when you enter and when you leave.  I can't wait for my next Vegas trip, because Vegas locations are the closest locations to CA!"}
{"text":"Omg, this might be one of the best chicken tenders I might of ever had.  So juicy and tender, and with not a lot of fried batter.   Also the Texas toast and coleslaw are really good.  I would recommend anyone to stop here."}
{"text":"I enjoy cane's. I like that they do one thing and do it well. Except this is the second time that I have been given the broke, short or mini size fries. The weight is ok, just they are except for a couple all the broken or rejects. Are the fries so valuable that you have to give the broken and end pieces to the customer. Just make some more or handle them so you don't break them. Yes, I guess it's petty but I feel like \"hey here comes that guy, let's give him the reject fries\".  The chicken is good, toast good. Crinkle cut fries are ok at best, but when they are the rejects, it makes me feel like I am paying for your scrap."}
{"text":"Chicken was bland.  Fries were delicious.  They had sweet tea which was a surprise and nice for those of us from the south east.   I wouldn't plan a visit back, as there are other places with way better chicken tenders around.   Plus side, it was $20 to feed my husband, kids, and myself."}
{"text":"Always had a good meal. We eat their two or three times a month. I am very picky and they have yet to let me down"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with canes. Littl life hack for you order the chicken sandwich with toast instead of bread and no lettuce boom!!"}
{"text":"Chicken was better than KFC and fries were good too. You get a lot for your money not like most fast food joints. I'd go back. I think the six-piece chicken fingers with Cole slaw and a 32-ounce drink plus lots of fries for $8.79 is the best deal if your hungry."}
{"text":"A little stingy on that famous sauce of theirs, but a solid choice for chicken strips.  If you hate coleslaw like I do, swap it out for another piece of toast at no cost.  My issues with the place would require a betraying their own foundation to fix.  Issues such as type of fries (never been a fan of crinkle cut) and not offering alternative dipping sauces like Ranch...a staple.  Otherwise, I do recommend this place in general."}
{"text":"Great tasting chicken and the southern bread is wonderful. Canes sauce is a must must must.  Don't see any dessert on the menu,  only downer .. But open until midnight ! Great for late night cravings .. Great value for the amount of food per meal."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm on this side of town i take a detour to Canes.  In my opinion this is some of the best tasting chicken on the planet.  Their Texas bread is awesome as well.  I always get two breads. I wish their were more locations."}
{"text":"I usually dine in , but was in a rush to go home. I ordered the 3 finger combo.  No one was in line and was perfect. Except for the 10 minutes wait and no ketchup that was asked for. Dine in because they care about you more inside."}
{"text":"The other night I came around at the busiest time (7ish) The line was long as can be. I waited patiently and I know everyone works hard . I ordered a three finger combo at the drive thru.  I was asked if I wanted ketchup and I said yes very eagerly. Long story short I'm not a fan of the caniac sauce and I don't have ketchup at my house. It sucked having to eat half my meal dry with one ketchup. Next time I'll say a lot of ketchup please . Also the car in front of me ordered the entire menu and I saw the employee dump a tub full of packets of sauce  into their bag."}
{"text":"This is first time I have been here and it was quite busy inside.  The drive thru was even busier as it wrapped around the whole building.  We ordered and got our food within 5 mins, they actually bring the food to your table. I thought a chicken fingers place, just another fast food joint serving mediocre chicken.  But to my surprise, this place actually makes excellent moist and tender chicken fingers with just a thin layer of breading. It didn't taste greasy like most deep fried foods.  Each chicken finger is a good size and oh so fresh.  We ordered the Caniac combo which came with Texas toast, coleslaw, 2 of their signature dipping sauce and large drink.  Not bad for under $9. I am a fan and will definitely come her for my chicken fingers fix."}
{"text":"The lady here gave me the wrong change so I can't give this place a perfect rating. I didn't even notice till I was driving home. The food itself it actually not bad. The chicken strips are all white meat and they seem to hand batter them on the spot before they flash fry them. The fries on the other hand are those generic french fries you buy at the winco and warm up at home. They also got this mayo based dipping sauce that ain't bad as well. It might just be mayo mixed with ketchup but it's good to me."}
{"text":"To only serve chicken strips, they better be good.  And they're great.  And the lemonade is some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This message is for Michael Santos. The robot malkom that works at the canes on lasVegas blvd, needs to be fired or cleen the toilets, not run the place...... I'm not that guy that call Corp or types up messages but I'm on fire and this will keep me from going to your store and starting it with the robot. I hope you get this ,from a canes chicken lover I'll never go back to that canes........"}
{"text":"For such a new restaurant, the place was pretty dirty ... floors, seating, tables, etc. Help was obnoxious and even using the \"F\" word with other customers. Didn't love the chicken - Sonic is better as well as chick fill a. Fries, toast, lemonade, and coleslaw were better. Wish they had more side options. Also, no sauces except their mystery sauce. I would've liked some mustard, BBQ, and some other options. Also, at almost 11pm, the place was pretty packed but no one over the age of 20 so definitely a high school hang-out."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers. Best dipping sauce. Fries are perfection. Texas toast, you are delicious. Doesn't get any better, seriously. If you're tired from all the fancy food & buffets on the Strip, come try this place out! For the price (which is inexpensive to begin with), it's totally worth it. Mad love for this place. Raising Cane's is always a MUST when we go to Vegas.   I hope they open up in SoCal one day!"}
{"text":"The chicken is very good, toast is excellent, the fries are so-so. The low review is for the lack of vegetarian options. There is just toast, fries and slaw. Delicious, but a really small menu.   Overall: Good food, skip it vegetarians"}
{"text":"I have no idea why people rave about this place. My first and last experience was underwhelming. There was a long line in the drive thru which falsely gave me the impression that this was something special. The line moved pretty fast. That's a plus for efficiency. I got up to the menu and was a little shocked at the complete lack of variety. No worries,  they must do fried chicken strips and fries so well that they don't need to do much else. I ordered the 3 chicken strip combo, paid,  & received my food. I parked to check out my order. The order was correct. I tried the texas toast first. It was okay. Nothing noteworthy but it's bread toasted with butter. That's not what I came there for anyway. Then I tried the chicken. The coating wasn't even, appeared light in color, and looked wet. At first I thought it was grease but it was actually just moisture from inside the styrofoam container. The chicken was flavorless. This is the first time I've ever had chicken that tasted like nothing, not even chicken. I dipped it in the Cane's sauce. That made it tolerable. I tried the fries next. They were limp, pale, and also appeared wet. They were devoid of any potato flavor and were unsalted. The moisture on them was also \"sweat\" from the inside of the container. I put the food down and ran some errands. When I got home I threw it away. The best way to describe this food is a combination of hospital cafeteria and old buffet food. If I'm going to eat something unhealthy like fast food I at least want it to taste good. This isn't worth the calories."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers everrrrrrr!!  My husband raved about this place and when I tasted it, I realized he wasn't exaggerating. For fast food it's ridiculous moist and delicious, the bread is my favorite part! Haha yummmmmmm we go to Vegas for this place!!! Open one in Cali please!!!!"}
{"text":"A classic university spot! I've been here more times than I can remember, and here's why: cheap, delicious, piping hot chicken fingers and fries (and not to mention, the to-die-for Cane's sauce)! It's pretty much always packed, but this location is well-staffed and they can definitely handle the rush. Everyone is very friendly and looks out for each other and the customers. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"okay soooo i am weird because i REALLY don't like chicken. i know that everyone likes chicken and even people who don't really like meat usually like chicken but i am just not a fan of the stuff. anyway, that said, i love raising cane's, and all they serve is chicken. they make one thing and they make it very well. we have no raising cane's in the chicago area, sooo we ate here twice for lunch on our last trip to vegas. i'm not ashamed! this place is delicious. the chicken just tastes FRESH and it is served with yummy texas toast, crispy fries and a delicious dipping sauce. mmm. now i'm hungry."}
{"text":"I  always wanted to try this place every time I pass by it but I always get detracted because of the long drive-thru line. But I was in the mood for some chicken strips and something to worth breaking my diet without breaking the bank.  I waited till after the dinner rush was over, which I thought was at 7:30 p.m. I was wrong. I arrive and there was still a line but it moved very quickly and smoothly. I assume because the menu doesn't have much variety. But hey when you establish a business with one main popular item that's all you need (hint in and out). I ordered the caniac box and doubles up on the fries instead of the coleslaw. It was enough to feed me twice! The chicken and texas toast was light and fluffy and did not make me feel like I was eating fast food, which was a plus! The fries could have been better, they should offer another side like mash potatoes or onion rings. The sauce was okay, nothing to crave for in my opinion. I would of preferred a spicier sauce."}
{"text":"The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Canes is \"fast\" as in fast service. These kids are on the ball. The food is good, the menu is simple (spoiler alert: it's chicken strips). They do strips well.  It's clean and friendly. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I must admit, this place has a hype! Although in my opinion, I like their chicken better than Chick-Filet. It makes me wonder why I randomly crave it though? It's just ok chicken fingers. Fries are nothing special, but they dont lie about their sauce. I ALWAYS mix the hot sauce with it. It completes the chicken. Also, Raising Canes has got to have the most refreshing sweet tea in this city. Theres always smiling service. & To top off why I come back through the drive through: they give my dog milkbone treats! A labrador is their mascot logo, so I always give kudos to dog lovers."}
{"text":"Raising Cain is the \"In-N-Out\" of chicken fingers.  On many a trip to the outlet mall of Vegas, my wife and I always noticed a huge line up of cars at this place called Raising Cain.  So, this trip we decided we needed a carb fix and checked out the reviews on Yelp...and decided that this was the place we needed to finally visit.  Well the trip was worth it!  There are basically 4 selections to choose from and they range from a plate with 3 chicken fingers to 6...or a sandwich.  Fries and a drink included for a very reasonable price.  The chicken fingers are like nothing we have tried before...lightly breaded, deep fried, tasty and not greasy at all.  In fact after ordering \"The Box\" (4 chicken fingers, coleslaw, fries and a drink)...I really only needed one napkin.  My wife thought the chicken fingers were great but commented that the crinkle cut fries were more like the frozen fries you buy in a bag at the grocery store.  I have to agree...they were nothing special.  The much raved about dipping sauce was also very good.  A slight zing and mild black pepper taste added to the wonderful flavor of the chicken fingers.  The coleslaw was also tasty.  The restaurant was clean with ample seating...and the staff very friendly.  When we finally headed out the door a friendly staffer said to us, \"Bye and have a great day\".  How often does that happen these days.  The chicken fingers I rate a 5...but the fries lower my overall rating down to a 4.  Great place to go when you need a quick carb fix!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Chicken fingers was very good and crispy and I like the fries too and Texas toast bread and it's good food"}
{"text":"I came in at 10:50 into canes and we came as a group and right when we walk in we're about to sit down and this rude employee tells me I can't sit down because there going to close and than when we're ordering our food the manager comes out being rude and tells us that we have to go when we get our food which is not right because we came in before they were closed and people were still eating so than why couldn't we stay and eat . I haven't experienced such rude customer service til today there is a way to tell customers things and when we tell the employee to not yell at us she still talks back and says she wasn't yelling at us . Jut a rude bad service overall never coming back !"}
{"text":"I just love their chicken their tenders are on point.. I always order the box with extra toast.."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm missing something, but these chicken fingers weren't that great.  They were decent, but pretty plain and blah in my opinion.  Going to a place that makes it whole menu revolve around this one item, I was expecting some pretty darn good fingers that had some flavor, spice, kick, something to them.  Fries were pretty mediocre too.  The chicken fingers I got the other night at Jack in the Box were ten times more flavorful than these, not to mention cheaper."}
{"text":"Best fast food chicken in town. Glad they opened one here on our side of town. The best is the secret crack sauce. This is the only place I would pay extra for sauce. The chicken is tasty and always hot, the sweet tea is wonderful and the Texas toast is great. Not really a fast food eater but I do love canes!"}
{"text":"Writing a review of Fast Food?  Going to Yelp Hell, but I love the chicken and the magic sauce (the best way to describe it) here!  We usually order the Caniac combo with extra texas toast and no slaw.  The chicken is always tender and juicy.  The magic sauce is to die for.  It has a tangy and rich bold flavor.  Raising Cane's is the ONLY place I would pay the extra $$ for the extra sauce.  I don't believe one should pay for extra sauce, but at Cane's, I do and it is well worth it!!!  The Texas toast is crunchy on one side and soft and pillow like on the other.  The Sweet Tea is as good as they make it in the south.  5 Stars for Fast Food review, you betcha'!"}
{"text":"I honestly do not see what the hype is about... Their chicken fingers are good... BUt amazing... Their sauce is okay... Nothin special to me... I may stop by again if I have a craving for chicken fingers.. But I will not go out of my way to drive here"}
{"text":"I usually don't review chain fast-food places but I've got a couple gripes with Raising Canes. First of all, I respect that they have a small menu. Any place that has so few choices must have some good product to stay in business -- and their chicken fingers are 'good product'. But the price is a little on the steep side in my opinion. $7.34 for their box combo meal which comes with 4 chicken fingers, fries, texas toast, cole slaw, and a drink. Maybe I'm just getting old and/or I'm really cheap, but I remember the days when you could get a huge lunch for under 5 bucks.  My other gripe is for the temperature in the restaurant. Holy shrinkage, Batman! It's freezing in there. If I needed to cut any of my food I could have used my razor sharp nipples because it was more than a bit chilly in there.  This new location opened recently on Rainbow, south of the 215. I went during the lunch rush and couldn't believe how many people were getting their grub on at this place. Serving nothing but chicken fingers is a niche market, but apparently it's a big niche."}
{"text":"It's crazy a place with such a simple menu and its main focus being chicken fingers could be so delicious, but it is! The chicken fingers here are fresh, never frozen. I ordered the \"3 Finger Combo\" priced at $5.99 and it included 3 chicken fingers, fries, texas toast, cane's sauce and a drink. The fingers had a great flavor and paired well with the cane's sauce. The texas toast was delicious and tasted great in the cane's sauce too! The fries were not that great. I'm not usually a fan of crinkle-cut fries anyway however these were kind of too crunchy outside and too dry inside. My hubby had the \"Sandwich Combo\" also priced at $5.99 that came with 3 chicken fingers, lettuce, fries, cane's sauce, a kaiser roll and drink. He assembled the sandwich to his liking and said he really enjoyed it, but he wasn't a fan of the fries either. One thing I wonder is why there isn't an option for spicy chicken fingers on the menu? Maybe one day I hope! For my drink I had the sweet tea and let me tell you... it's addicting! The sweet tea is brewed fresh and goes so nicely with the chicken!  As with most Raising Cane's in town, the drive-thru can be long. It's basically similar to waiting in a In-N-Out Burger drive-thru. Since they are making everything fresh, I don't mind waiting. The cashier was very friendly and told me about the Caniac Club where you can earn rewards with each visit. Next time you are at a Raising Cane's just ask for a card! Once you have your card, go online and register it and get a free \"Box Combo\" just for signing up! The box combo includes everything I had in my 3 finger combo, but you get the addition of 1 more chicken finger and a side of coleslaw. Score! They also offer a kids meal as well \"Tailgates\" which are party packs of either 25, 50, 75 or 100 chicken fingers that come with sauce."}
{"text":"I know Raising Cane's is very popular. I mean just seeing the long line of cars in the drive-thru, one that can easily rival the long one at In N Out, tells me that RC has a following. I personally don't get the hype. While I do think the chicken tastes good, it's just nothing special to me and reminds me of plain chicken fingers that kids dip in ketchup. I have always wished that they would have the option for your fingers to be tossed in flavored sauces which would make sense to have options like that given this is a place where the main star is chicken fingers. Inside offers a decent amount of seating and tables. They had a good amount of employees on hand and there was someone really taking there time moving stuff to clean tables, chairs, floors etc. which is always nice and it did look very clean inside. The employees that helped me were very friendly and the vibe was good.   3 Finger Combo ($6.19) - This comes with 3 chicken fingers, 1 cane's sauce, crinkle-cut fries, Texas toast and a 22 oz drink. I added an extra piece of toast for $0.99 cents and an extra Cane's sauce for $.029 cents. The chicken fingers were good, but didn't taste amazing. The chicken at Chick Fil A has far more flavor in my opinion. The crinkle-cut fries were very good as was the Texas toast. For some reason my Cane's sauce was too salty and it's usually not, so maybe they just made an off batch. The sweet tea is pretty good and pairs nicely with the chicken. I will not be back as often as the other faithful followers, but from time to time RC will do."}
{"text":"Fast service. Chicken was good for fast food. They don't have ranch which really surprised me. The cane sauce is buttery. They have a drive thru so you can grab and run."}
{"text":"Honestly over priced chicken fingers , young staff that can't comprehend and can't take orders correctly and sloppy way to make the food. Got more sauce than anything else.. waste of cash"}
{"text":"I love going here whenever I have a craving for chicken strips because this place never lets me down! I like getting the box combo which comes with a drink, fries, a slice of buttered bread, and 4 chicken strips. The set also comes with coleslaw, but I usually just sub it out for extra sauce (or you can choose to get more fries). The price isn't too bad either (I think it is about $8).  The fries are usually crispy and are crinkle-cut! This is a big deal for me because soggy and overly oily fries are the worst lol. The chicken strips along with the sauce is a really good combination. My only complaint is the chicken strips tend to be on the smaller side compared to other places I've been to, but I guess that's why they give you all those sides lol.  I recommend checking this place out at least once if you haven't tried it yet. The staff is nice and the lively atmosphere (assuming there are other people dining at that time) make it a good place if you want a really casual meal with some friends."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day because I as craving for some crispy chicken goodness and I have to say that this location was just decent. I got the 4 piece meal and the chicken pieces were pretty small compared to the other locations I have been to. Another downer is the chicken and fries were not really crispy. I'm hoping it was just an off day or maybe my meal was just rushed. Besides that, the experience was okay overall. I probably won't come back to this location, but I'll stick to the other places I've been to."}
{"text":"Head is about to explode...  I want to start with my previous experiences which have been so extremely hit or miss. Its either really great food and accurate or its a total whiff.   This last visit-- First, my total for the box combo was $7.77, I had .86c in my coin tray and asked the girl to wait while I gave her the change portion of my total. I drop a dime in the crack between my seat and middle console. So I have 76c at this point and before handing it over I ask her if thats OK? She said YES. I give her the change and she closes the window for 1-2 minutes and then gives me my dollar change and....99c... I'm dumb founded what just happened. Next-- I get my box combo and somehow I got double sauce and no coleslaw.   They have good food-- theres no doubt or question there. But as far as the quality of the trainers and for lack of motivation of beating around the bush right now to be polite, a competent staff.  Do better Cane's. Care more about the service you provide and the people you hire to represent your values and retain customers."}
{"text":"Great service and food! So glad this location opened. Sat outside with our miniature poodle and watched cars drive through the flood created by a broken water line on St. Rose."}
{"text":"Let me telllllll you something about Cane's!!!!   My lil sister has been raving about this place ever since I got into town  (lol) and I was really reluctant because although she's my sister, I feel like our tastes in food are different. She likes things plain while I, on the other hand, don't mind all the veggies. We also went with out cousin who eats extremely healthy. She's vegan but recently started eating chicken, again. Anyhow, it was my very first time there and our cousin and the workers were very, very friendly. The prices, were alright. Not pricey, under $10. We dined in because, Lord know..the heat is much too much (smh). But everything changed once we got our freshly squeezed lemonade to drink. It was so yummy, it was hard for us, not to drink it all up but then we got served our food. It was a huuuuge plate with chicken tenders, french fries (usually it comes with coleslaw but we subbed for fries) and a slice of bread that smelt, oh so buttery. We (myself and my cousin) both had our first bites of the chicken tenders and man oh man were they juicy :D the gentleman that helped us told us we should try their special sauce which I did but it tasted like mayo w ketchup and a dash of pepper (lol) which isn't a bad thing but definitely not a special thing either (lol). I enjoyed their chicken tenders soooo much I could not even finish it, even though I wanted to SO BAD ): Best thing about it though is that I could take it home and eat it and it didn't taste like processed food like how McDonalds or Jack in the Box or any other fast food restaurants food would."}
{"text":"Definitely wasnt impressed with this place.  The drive thru was very fast and efficient but the food was all luke-warm and a bit soggy. The sauce was lacking interesting flavor."}
{"text":"It was alright. Not sure what the fuss is about, as it was average. Service was good. Restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Recently tried this fast food joint and was pleasantly surprised? by? the quality? and tastiness of their?  chicken fries and toast."}
{"text":"I cant believe this place only does chicken fingers and they were no better than fingers I could pop into my oven at home from my grocers frozen food secton. If you only do one thing it should be amaze-balls, and it wasn't. Chicken was not juicy, the breading was soft/mushy, not crunchy at all. Save your money and hit up KFC, it'll be 10 times better and actually crispy!"}
{"text":"Always busy in the drive thru but they move pretty fast! Friendly employees and  their food always taste AMAZING!!! I'm so addicted to their bread yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"No ranch!? That's like a deal breaker.   The \"special sauce\" was ok. I mean everyone has a \"special sauce\"....let's think of something more creative.   Nonetheless...good was fresh and fast. Fries were a little soggy. No strong distinct flavors. Tasted like your average chicken fingers and fries."}
{"text":"I have never had an issue with the Raising Canes off the I-17 and Peoria in Phoenix, AZ until today. I was trying to use my husbands card to purchase us food and was told (from the drive-thru) that I was not able to use his card without ID. I have used his card in the past with no problem.   I am posting this to help avoid the next person with the inconvenience that I experienced. I waited 15 min in the drive-thru to be told \"sorry, can't use this card.\" So, make sure you have ID with you when going to this Cane's location."}
{"text":"The Cane's sauce is awesome!  The chicken fingers are really great but why did they simply stop there?  Improve the french fries!!!  Make them different!  They are really b-o-r-i-n-g (unless you dip them in the Cane's sauce then they are less b-o-r-i-n-g).  I'm not a fan of the Texas toast.  It makes for too much food even when you only order a 3 finger meal."}
{"text":"I really don't get it.  The good: +The service is great & employees are really friendly. +They have good ice. +They have Splenda. +Texas toast is pretty good.  The not-so-good: -Where's the flavor in the chicken?  Please brine that meat or at least put some salt in the coating.  I'm surprised that a place that does one thing doesn't do it better. -The sauce.  I just don't like the flavor. -The fries.  I didn't like the temperature, texture, or flavor. -Locked bathrooms.  Gross to wash your hands and then have to take that dirty key (wrapped in a paper towel, of course) back to the counter and then go eat.  I don't like food-handling employees having to touch that dirty key over & over again, either."}
{"text":"I never wanted to find myself on Thomas Rd. saying \"I'd like 3 fingers\", but that's how my night at Cane's began.... Over all, I can say my 3 finger experience wasn't as fulfilling as I'd hoped.  For being a place that \"specializes\" in chicken, I wasn't impressed. The special sauce was alright. They give you a piece of toast with your meal. Overall it just seemed greasy - not my style. I'd rather go get some chicken from Safeway."}
{"text":"I've never had a reason to complain about Canes. I love their food and their service is UNBEATABLE! Once, while stopping through the Drive-Thru, the associate sang to me! Everything is always clean when I go inside and the food is ALWAYS hot and fresh. These guys are great!"}
{"text":"Can't ever go wrong.   Fast chicken fingers!  Food is always excellent. Always a handful of staff making the somewhat seeming long lines, shorter. Though most are adolescent and teens, looks like they train very well.   I'd frequent if there were more locations :)  Check out their catering menu too for those events you may throw at home.   a bajillion + for SWEET TEA!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place here in AZ, originally in LA based. It was basically made for someone like me who LOVES CHICKEN, FRIES, and SWEET TEA! The customer service was phenomenal and I wish I could come back here.. I really recommend if you love chicken strips!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars  The short: Open and clean setup with friendly staff, but it's basically just-ok carby kid food.  The long: On the south side of Thomas, just west of 44th St., turning left into the lot can be a bear during peak traffic, but it's otherwise fairly accessible for people driving in from the west or walking up, like I did. The inside is wide open and clean with plenty of chairs and tables that were just a little too cluttered around the restaurant floor plan. Otherwise, it doesn't stick out much from other fast food joints. I went during the middle of a somewhat busy lunch period, and who seemed to be the head cashier loudly greeted just about everyone who walked in the front door on the other side of the restaurant. My cashier was friendly and quick, though he seemed a tiny bit frazzled by the small rush.   I ordered The Box combo and a lemonade to go and headed back to my office a short 5-minute walk away. I hoped the freshly squeeze lemonade would be awesome, even if they did charge only about a dime more than fountain drinks for a regular. Although I could taste the lemon, the drink was so sweet, it may as well have been from a mix or carton. The Box comes with a small container of sweet coleslaw dressed in a lot of mayo, a slab of soft-in-the-inside, perfectly browned-on-the-outside toast, somewhat slightly crisp, thin crinkle cut fries, a container of Cane sauce (which tastes like burger sauce), and, of course, four chicken strips. Unless you're me and you get only three chicken strips . . . or two smallish chicken strips and one big chicken strip that maybe they counted as two, but really, halfway through the meal, you're so carbed-out full that you don't miss anything aside from the extra dollar you paid for that extra chicken strip. The strips were fine. It was real chicken, and true to advertising, it was fresh. Sort of crispy, but not as crispy as I'd hoped, or even expected. Tender and moist enough to not be bad. But not special. All of it was pretty one-note. I can't even tell you what part of the meal I liked best . . . maybe the toast. Coincidentally, every time I took a bite of that toast, I'd think, \"This is the most random slice of toast ever. What's it even doing here?\"   So, it's fine if you're like me and want to try every new eatery that opens near my home or office and appreciate the novelty of places like this, but personally, I won't be making a return visit.  Edit: I almost threw my drink cup away before I noticed the giveaway pull tab on it--I won a free slice os Texas toast! How do you like them apples? =)"}
{"text":"This place is clean and pretty simple.  If you like chicken fingers this is the place.  Sauce is good, I recommend it.  A good cheap place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious!  My son is addicted to the chicken and Texas toast.  The service is always very pleasant and the food is always fresh and hot.  Very rarely have I had much of a wait in the drive thru line.  Definitely a crowd pleaser with the high school students in the area!"}
{"text":"Not much to talk about....great place....good food.....im not much into canes.....but the wifey loves it....nuff said."}
{"text":"I keep being dragged here. GRRRRRR!!!!As much as I want to dislike it, it's good. The sauce is yummy, the chicken (it's chicken strips what do you want?) it hot and tasty, the bread is nice, the fries are basic."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's appeals to me sometimes when I am craving it. I can't have it too many times or even twice a week, it's more of a random craving for me.  I usually opt for the box combo. Their chicken tenders are pretty good. Don't forget the cane sauce! I also switch out my cole slaw for another Texas Toast. Oh, and don't forget to get your Texas Toast toasted on both sides!  They have the little ice cubes which I like. If you order drive thru, sometimes I feel like they put a little too much ice.   Clean establishment inside. They have cool posters too."}
{"text":"They do make amazing chicken strips, I must say. I wrap em in the Texas toast, than dip em in their sauce. The fries are just ok. They're like Chinese food fries here in NY. Thick, crinkle cut. No me gusta. Oh, the ice tea. Its crack! In a good way. Get the sweetened ice tea. If your eating fried chicken & fries, u might as well get the sweat tea. This place is perfect for kids. Straight up child menu.  Chicken strips, baby!"}
{"text":"I usually like chicken but raising canes on Shea was some of the driest chicken fingers I've ever eaten and lemonade taste like soap and way too much sugar the nice thing about this place was the people were very friendly and the place was clean other than that  I would suggest if you want chicken go to the experts at KFC"}
{"text":"I have avoided Raising Canes for so long. I ate at a location in Mississippi before and was severely disapponted.  This location has changed my opinion of the franchise. The portions were large and cooked well. The sauce was flavorful and the chicken was moist. The fries were crispy and salted to perfection. Only disappointment was the Texas toast, which was bland   Still giving it only a 3 though, because it is pretty expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Great chicken for a quick easy meal. It's  awesome that the dine in crew brings your food to the table. Staff is very courteous."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. Lately they've been inconsistent with their sauce and toast. Sometimes it's really salty. Other than that, the chicken are always fresh and moist."}
{"text":"They have really really really good fast food chicken. I love love love chicken strips.... and man... do I love love LOVE their chicken fingers. You must must must MUST dip it in their sauce.  Simple menu and great food!  Next time I am in Vegas I will definitely stop by this place. I really wish they had one in Los Angeles, siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh."}
{"text":"Raising canes. A little over hyped. It's pretty basic.  Ordered the 3 finger combo with a sweet tea. It's pretty good, but the cane sauce is where it's at! The sauce itself is pretty magical, that with the Texas toast is perfect for those late night munchies.  It's pretty convenient that it's late night, and they have have a drive thru!   The sweet tea is good, but like 90% of it is ice so I would probably opt out of getting a drink.  I wouldn't be opposed if someone wanted to get it but I wouldn't particularly go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out today I waited in the drive-through for 20 minutes and I finally was able to give them my order  only to find out that they require an ID with your debit card! Why the hell don't they have a sign up that says \"we are a bunch of assholes and require an ID for a five dollar meal.\" I get they're trying to be all safe and protect themselves from having to deal with fraud because a company that does that doesn't care about the customer they only care about protecting themselves in case someone says the charges fraudulent because then the company is out that money! Maybe you should be more concerned about your customers. I'm not so much upset at the fact that they wanted my ID for the smallest charge ever and I didn't have it on me in this instance I'm pissed because I sat in that stupid freaking line for 20 minutes before I was notified that was their rule honestly get your shit together and get a fucking sign."}
{"text":"You must like chicken to go here. If you don't, you will be hungry. Also, don't you dare ask for ranch. It offends them to even ask. The only thing they have are chicken strips, coleslaw, fries, and Texas toast. That being said, it's tasty. There is usually a line wrapped around the building which is a good sign. Not often in the mood for chicken strips, but when I am, it's good."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Las Vegas I go to this Raising Cane's location, and for the last 7 years or so.  I always get hot, fresh, tasty moist chicken fingers, hot crispy French fries, chilled cole slaw, buttery crispy Texas toast, and the special dipping sauce is outta this world!!!.  Hard working efficient servers.  So consistent in everything they do!"}
{"text":"When in the mood for chicken fingers Raising Cane's is always reliable. They have many options when it comes to quantity of fingers in your combo, which comes with fries, Texas toast, coleslaw and a drink. Resanably priced and always good I enjoy my cane's fix now and then!"}
{"text":"I try to avoid most fast food but let's face it, I still have cravings from time to time and wanted something different. Going to lunch with co workers who suggested this place I was on board since I have never been here. It's a pretty much what as advertised, fried chicken and sides. I had a combo with chicken, fries, cole slaw and garlic toast. Along with a drink. The food was ok except for the cole slaw. It was funny and bland, not at all good. It was just ok and now I remover why I don't eat at many fast food places."}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(191/365) \"Bones Or Fingers?\"  Great chicken fingers, made to order and not sitting under a heat lamp. Cool! I like the chicken, but the fries and Texas Toast are just okay, and even if they say that the Lemonade is freshly squeezed, I still feel like it isn't, so I stick to the Sweet Tea instead.  Personally, I prefer bone-in bird, and I go for the boneless fingers once in a great while. Service is always pleasant, and if you got a family to feed, Cane's may not be a bad idea. ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uu  3.5"}
{"text":"Definitely the best chicken fingers in the fast food industry. Sweet tea is really refreshing! The service was friendly and fast. No complaints! The fries aren't anything special."}
{"text":"Anthony was super kind and very friendly . Greeted us kindly and when I saw the line was getting long he jumped right to the register to help . Absolutely love this location . Thanks again anthony with the great customer service"}
{"text":"They asked me if I wanted to make a donation three times after I gave a stern \"no\" the first time.  Who does that  Btw, this is my first \"negative\" Yelp review."}
{"text":"Although I wish they had a bit of a more creative menu, I appreciate the chicken finger only when I come to Canes. The fresh squeezed lemonade and fresh brewed sweet tea is a bonus in my book! Oh and yeah that sauce is the boss! Props to them for staying open til midnight, this is Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best fast food chicken fingers. The cane sauce is BOMB.com!!! Confusing menu and kind of pricey for fast food."}
{"text":"So, after hearing a lot of really good things about Raising Cain's I decided to swing by for lunch today.  Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed.   I'll go through piece by piece.  -The bread was pretty awful.  It was soggy and had a weird flavor to it.   -The fries were average at best.  Not terrible but nothing special either. -Cain's sauce is BLEH.  I tried their honey mustard as well and it wasn't very good, either. -The chicken was the only thing that was actually good.  The breading was very plain but the chicken itself was tasty and, as others have mentioned, actually tastes like real chicken. -There was a lot of food for the price, so that was good, too.  Overall it wasn't very good.  I won't be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Ahh yes - raising canes. I came here during a vacation to Las Vegas because I've heard about it so much. The chicken tenders were really tender and the fries were so crispy! This is not your average fast food chicken tenders meal. Additionally, the toast was super scrumptious and fluffy. I think the toast is really what made the meal unique. I did feel gross after eating it but hey, that's fried food, and it was definitely worth it!  However, the service was SO bad. I was disappointed because it's supposed to be a \"fast food\" place. I came at 7 pm and had to wait 25 minutes for my food!"}
{"text":"My grandaughters and I were there on Sat and the young guy taking our order was rolling his eyes and being a jerk. We won't come back there again. I hate being treated rudely"}
{"text":"In Vegas and we were looking for a quick bite to eat, decided to have fast food but wanted something new, so we decided to drop by Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers and I ended up loving it!!!  So good, so affordable, and so fast; the chicken fingers were so tender and it did not appear greasy whatsoever. I've been here a couple of times after the first time and my usual order is now the Combo Box (which I share with my husband) - comes with four pieces of chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, texas toast, one Cane's Sauce, and a regular drink priced around $7!  The combination of chicken, slaw, fries, and toast together satisfies me in all ways; the texas toast is by far the best toast I have ever had, really! The outer part of the bread is golden and crispy, but once you pass that outer layer, the middle part of the bread is so soft and just literally melts in your mouth. Love it!"}
{"text":"Very expensive!  Another restaurant that's greedy & has no real value to their menu. Chick-fil-A- is sooooo much better & they don't charge you extra for additional sauces!"}
{"text":"Will always come back. They are amazing. Chicken is always on point. Not a five stars because I'm picky and when I say no lettuce on the sandwich, I expect no lettuce, but once in awhile they still put the lettuce. Other than that, pretty solid."}
{"text":"No BBQ Sauce!!?? How can you serve chicken fingers with no barbecue sauce or ranch dressing come on!!! Their sauce tastes ok, but I need BBQ with my chicken fingers!!  Everything was delicious and fresh, but damnit I had to eat it with no BBQ Sauce!! NOTE TO SELF: Bring Own BBQ Sauce!"}
{"text":"Came across this place by accident, the chicken strips were great, the meal came with 6 strips, coleslaw, fries and Texas toast. All for under $10. The only downfall was it was very loud inside. They had there own dipping sauce, good but diffrent. We had four meals and came in under $30. I should mention they have sweet tea. They told us the restaurant originated in Louisiana."}
{"text":"Best fast food chicken I've had in a while! I had the chicken sandwich for the first time in my life last weekend and now I'm having dreams about it. *drool* the fries were perfectly salty and that dipping sauce is amazing! Highly recommend for those of us that dont have one around where they live."}
{"text":"UPDATE 12/15/16: The management contacted me following my previous bad review. They apologized profusely multiple times and invited us to come back and try again and we accepted. We dined in a few weeks ago on a Saturday for lunch before a movie. While we didn't get to try out the drive-through service, the dine-in was fantastic. The employees were all very friendly, the food was fresh and hot, and the inside was clean and decorated quite nicely (if a bit eccentric). We will definitely be coming back as the management has successfully convinced me our previous issue was a one-time fluke.    PREVIOUS REVIEW: I'm new to Las Vegas and I'm a UNLV student. The school gets Raising Cane's catering for nearly every event and it's always delicious. When I found out there was one near my new apartment, I was excited to try it.   The first day, I stopped by at about 2:30 on a Thursday afternoon. I went through the drive through and it took nearly 10 minutes for my food to come out. When it did, it wasn't very warm either. I chalked it up to a bad day and didn't say anything.   Tonight, my boyfriend went to get take out for dinner. Once again, it took forever for our food to come out and since there was such a line behind him, my boyfriend didn't check the order before he left the restaurant. We ordered a combo and asked that instead of fries we get a second slice of toast, instead, we got double fries and no toast, even though the receipt had our order written out correctly. Also, I ordered a 3 piece chicken strips and instead, I got closer to 2 1/2. The third strip was basically a glorified chicken nugget. I really should have taken a picture.   Overall, I would definitely recommend Raising Cane's for their food and catering but this particular location has issues, especially with to-go and take out. I'd go to another location or check out any of the other restaurants in the mall nearby."}
{"text":"At work when we order food EVERYBODY wants Canes! It's so delicious and their sauce is the best. Fortunately for me they have special menu's where you can order enough food for 16 people!  It's always delicious and everyone is always happy!"}
{"text":"Made to order , juicy and tasty chicken tenders.  The 25 piece tailgate is a great treat!"}
{"text":"Simply but yet done so perfect one the best chicken fingers I've had and the sauce is a must have"}
{"text":"Canes is the perfect fast food option when you're on the go, but still want something real. The last time I was there I didn't get any chicken, but I am a huge fan of their tenders and their sauce. Honestly their fries aren't my favorite but I love the sauce so much that anything dipped in it would still be good. Their toast is probably my favorite menu item from their, and pairing it with the sauce is like being in fast food heaven. Open late on weekends so it's always a good idea after a night out!"}
{"text":"OK, so I had to try the concept eventually.  It certainly isn't the only chain to work with a very limited menu.  The food was ok.  The service was pleasant.  Enough people must like the place as noon was approaching it got pretty full and there was also take out orders.  If chicken was what I had in mind and I was close I would go again.  But I would not drive across town."}
{"text":"I feel like all canes locations are pretty much the same as far as cleanliness and service.  This one is particularly busy during the lunch hour Monday through Friday. They have a very basic menu that is only chicken products.  The one thing that I do get excited about is the fact that they have delicious sweet tea. I'm from the south and picky about my sweet tea. This place has the real deal.  Lots of people rave over their canes sauce.  While I do agree it is tasty it's nothing special.  I enjoy it on my fries more than my chicken tenders. There is no other dipping sauce available other than ketchup.  As far as chicken places go, canes just doesn't compare to Zaxbys or Chick-Fila but we don't have those here in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is great and now conveniently located by the strip :-) now everyone who visits Las Vegas doesn't have to travel far off the strip! This place is better than most fast food chicken places"}
{"text":"For a place that has 5 things on the menu and a \"boss\" sauce that I can put on any part of my meal purchased here, this place makes the grade (and I secretly wish there were something like this closer to the office).  Agreed with Kevin P. - friendly, quick service that is better than most fast food establishments (regardless of whether you're in Vegas or not!), and they DO give personalized service. I think that it's a part of the training...even if the things they say are scripted, they actually say it and sound like they mean it. :)  I just went to the website - the story is pretty cool. The founder was basically shot down by his professor and the banks, saying that there was no way you would succeed with a chicken finger restaurant. And now he's laughing all the way to the bank with 80 locations in 13 states.   4 shakas!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive-through I thought the food would be ready quicker. The service was a little slow but that's because the food came out fresh.  Cashier was very friendly the chicken tasted fantastic and the fries were crispy and I fresh well worth the wait"}
{"text":"All my friends & coworkers rave about this place & always tell me they have to stop off here when they're in vegas so of course I had to also! It's exactly what they say it is, a chicken fingers place with a side of Texas toast & fries. As well as a sit down place it's a drive through & they do catering. When we came in there was a line & the place was packed! But service is very quick & we had our food almost right after we ordered.   Very fresh chicken, so tasty ! Their website says everything is made to order & there's no heat lamps. Texas toast is to die for ommgg I could eat that all day ! There's also their raising canes sauce which is what I think really makes people love their food but I'm a very picky sauce eater so I didn't try it. While their chicken is so good to me it is just chicken so it wasn't like a WOW when I ate it which is why I think the sauce is what really makes it. Overall it was good & inexpensive & I can see why people come here all the time."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!!! Mike was so personable! It was my first time there and in from Cali! He made me feel at Home  I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"This canes is usually pretty dirty but I deal with it when I want canes. Today was a pretty busy day there and we all walked up and there credit and debit card machine was broken!! Everyone walked away angry because few people carry cash on them. How difficult is it to get someone out and fix it. They were losing business because of this"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fun decor, good music, food was delicious as usual. Right on Raising Canes!"}
{"text":"If I'm being honest, I've gotta say I have more respect for a restaurant that focuses on making only one thing well, than I have for places with a huge menu of mediocre offerings.  There's quite a few restaurants these days rocking the simplified menu, but I don't think any do it as well as Cane's. All they serve is fried chicken strips, and a chicken strip sandwich. Basically the only choice you have to make is how many strips you want for your meal.  I find with the sides, the standard 4 strip box combo is perfectly filling for me (and I'm a pretty big guy). The chicken is simple, but delicious and juicy. The fries are plain ol' crinkle cut, but they compliment the chicken wonderfully. You also get a side of coleslaw (decent), and a thick slice of Texas toast (awesome).   You get a cane's sauce with your meal but I recommend ordering an extra side because it's actually really good. I've always been a fan of dipping my chicken strips in ranch and I was disappointed to find that cane's doesn't have it. It didn't take long for me to fall in love with this stuff however. I'm not sure what's in it, but it's creamy like ranch, with a nice little zest added.  Their sweet tea is awesome! I like to mix it with regular iced tea so it's a little more subtle and not too sweet.   When Cane's is on a good day, you're food will come out incredibly hot. It's very rare for me to receive anything less than hot food, but I have been served warm strips and fries before. It was disappointing, but I haven't experienced this very often, and even when warm, the chicken is still pretty great. With the exception of a few off days, cane's is pretty consistent, which is a big reason I love the place.  I want to give a five star rating, but until cane's can guarantee hot,fresh food every time, I think four is the best I can do (which is still really great)."}
{"text":"I love it here!! Always welcoming staff and the environment is awesome!! Food is on point with their amazing sauce! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"First had Raising Canes in Vegas last year. I was very happy to find one on this trip to AZ. The sweet tea was excellent. Chicken strips were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Bread was great. Fries were just ok, but you are here for the chicken strips anyways. This experience matched my expectations."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through. Ordered 6 pieces and got 4. Went in and complained to the manager. Got a sorry and made me wait again. Didnt even mention it to his employees. Bad service. Go to another branch."}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken strips!  The Texas toast is good.  Fries could be crispier...  The Cane's sauce is GREAT.  This place is BUSY!  And the decor is pretty cool  We ate in and my god daughter was excited because cute boys were sitting behind us... LOL!"}
{"text":"My first time here and it was unpleasant. I was asked for my id while I was in the drive thru which I have never been asked for my ID at any fast food establishment. I felt he looked at me a certain way because I was brown skin. I am a Mexican American and proud of it and the young man who asked for my id was white and looked at me as though I had no business being there like I could not afford to buy a meal from Raising Canes. The guy gave me back my id but didn't give me my card back and when I called the manager answered and said they always ask for ID. I went through the drive thru and noticed that the 2 individuals in front of me were not asked for their ID. Needless to say I will never go back to this location or any other raising canes since I believe they promote racism and cover for their employees."}
{"text":"Denise is an outstanding manager! I'm a regular here because i work down the street and she never fails to ask me how work is & get my order started early because she knows I'm on break! The entire staff is always so nice & friendly, love coming here :)"}
{"text":"We had pretty much the simplest order you can get; a chicken sandwich with canes sauce. She forgot the canes sauce and charged us extra for it... places like this shouldn't charge extra for sauce when their employees are likely to forget to add it to the order."}
{"text":"This place is always packed and so good. We were greeted as soon as we walked in.They took our order at the counter right away.  This food is amazing and the best part is we ran into some friends while we were here!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow really .... I've never heard of this place ... I'm familiar with the area being that I come to L V once a year with my familia  ... The food was so good ... Fresh hot delicious ...,the staff was so nice and friendly ...I'm so in luv with this place ... Can't wait to go back ... Oh and did I mention it's so much food ... We ate at 5 pm we're still so full at 10 pm ... Pls come to my area ... I need u lol"}
{"text":"I would say these are the best chicken fingers I've ever eaten. They were tender and just enough coating. The \"secret\" sauce had a little kick and was awesome.  The menu is simple so it doesn't take forever to decide what to order and the price is very reasonable.  My husband loves sweet tea and theirs tastes just like what you get in the South."}
{"text":"Of course the food is great. They follow the successful principle of keep it simple. No food that has been sitting under a warmer, it's made to order and the crinkle cut fries are crispy and hot. For this I would give the best rating, but for sure gave it five because the bathrooms are lovely and immaculate.  Restaurant owners so often fail to realize how much women love clean facilities. It's not the reason we come but could well be the reason we don't return, so congratulations to this establishment for doing it right."}
{"text":"Love this place.  If it was cheaper I would eat here everyday.  Lines are a bit long, but what can you do when got chicken this good.  I do t know anyone who doesn't like Canes!"}
{"text":"Raising Cains is great!! The menu is very simple. Chicken strips a side and a drink. The best thing about this restaurant chain is that all their chicken strips are cooked fresh and never frozen. It makes their chicken strips among the best you can get. Prices are reasonable too. The biggest combo is the \"Caniac\" and it has 6 strips and fries for under $10.  Multiple locations in Las Vegas and open late until midnight or 1am"}
{"text":"This is a great fast food alternative for chicken lovers.  The chicken has great taste, the sauce is flavorful and has a southern soulful flavor.  Staff is friendly and the coleslaw is not bad either.  The box combo is one of my lunch alternative faves.  This is a great alternative to the usual burger joints."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! I tried it one time by stumbling upon it while visiting Las Vegas and now I'm hooked. I wish they had these in South FL"}
{"text":"It's fast food, but I find this is actually my tied for number #1 chicken strip shack.  Also love, love, love the Cains sauce, they should be selling this at the grocery store.  Food quality is consistent, and hot, and the fries are the good crinkle cut ones like I had when I was a kid."}
{"text":"Price is good but chicken was dry. All they sell is chicken fingers, fries, bread and cole slaw. The lemonade is barely sweet."}
{"text":"First time coming here when I moved to Vegas. The chicken is really good and the sauce they give you is delicious. The service is good and the workers are very customer service oriented. We ate inside once and as we were eating a worker came and asked if we needed anything. Will be coming back again and again"}
{"text":"went in to canes expecting to be fulfilled emotionally and spiritually. i drive through excruciating heat with no ac to get some savory chicken tenders. i verified with the cashier at the window that there was extra canes sauce. i get back to work only to find no extra canes sauces in my bag. my coworker, tyler, decided to eat a chicken tender with no sauce. the dry chicken tender caught in his throat, despite our efforts he choked to death. i am writing this review surrounded my EMTs. expect to hear from my lawyer!"}
{"text":"I love Canes chicken strips. I was very disappointed this time to discover the chicken strips are so SMALL for what you pay for. I ordered just 3 chicken strips to discover it looked like 1 1/2 chicken strips. It didn't even fill me up. Plus they charge for that pepper canes sauce and they have NO RANCH!! They are very cheap  with giving out sauces. Not sure if I will come back to this location."}
{"text":"Good Ice Tea and Fresh White meat Chicken Fingers. The Staff is really good but the sauces lack on variety. NO Ranch or BBQ?? And the canes sauce is nothing special. The Texas toast awesome. Cole slaw not so much. Ice tea is great and the lemonade is good. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"After driving by Canes for years, and observing the lines of customers, I decided to try their fares when they opened up in the area.  I ordered a meal which contained six chicken tenders, french fries, cole slaw, toasted bread, and two mustard based sauces.  The chicken was crispy, well done, and a bit greasy (you can feel the oil dripping into your mouth when you bite into the chicken.  The french fries are accordion sliced without much flavor, The cole slaw was good as was the toasted bread.  All in all, it was OK, but would prefer almost all chicken alternatives in town.    Overall review.... Feh"}
{"text":"First place I went to with my friends when I arrived in Scottsdale for Spring Training. They had both previously been here and living in CA I'm pretty ignorant to chicken wings, but I know good food when I try it. I ended up coming here around 2:00pm and it wasn't crowded at all. The girl that took my order was very nice as was the lady who dropped my food off. I ordered there four wings combo with texas toast, French fries and lemonade. The sauce used to dip it in was delicious (not even sure what it was made of). The chicken was tender and fresh, but most importantly hot and delicious! The lemonade was great and actually wasn't too sweet. The French fries were nice and crispy and combined with the chicken worked out very well. The store itself is very clean and well maintained as well. If I ever return to Scottsdale I'll definitely drop by again!"}
{"text":"Really great food and great service absolutely love the chicken!!! 10/10 service is very good as well. Very fast. Maybe due to the reason chicken fingers is all they make lol. Great family eatery!"}
{"text":"The chicken fingers here are excellent when rated on a scale of fast food. Delivered to your table by first name, hot and fresh and ready to eat. My only complaint is, for example, when ordering The Caniac you only get 2 sauces. Ask for an extra one and you will pay for it (thirty cents). They're pretty stingy with them. The employees are friendly, fast, and attentive. Go in with a \"fast food\" expectation and you will love it here!"}
{"text":"This place Raising Cane's I think is a bit overrated. I have heard from locals and visitors that this place is a must try for some legit fried chicken strips. I was really looking forward to trying this place out after all the hype.   Walking inside there were tons of people and the line was fairly long but it being right by the outlets could be why it was crowded, just saying lol. The menu wasn't very big, it was quite limited. I expected more variety and more side dishes. I ordered a 3 strip combo which came with fries, bread and special sauce. The chicken was good don't get me wrong but it just didn't blow me away like I thought it would. The strips had a crispy crust which is always a plus, the fries were mediocre nothing special. The special sauce looked like thousand island dressing kind of but it sure didn't taste like it, can't explain the taste but it was a bit peppery but very good. Now the bread was my favorite part of the meal, it looked like it was a grilled hot dog bun of some sort. It was buttery and had a hint of garlic, it was so good!  Overall the food was good, prices were ok and service was good but I feel as though it wasn't the best chicken strips I've ever had. I would go back but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I LOVE Raising Canes!  I was able to eat here again during my LV visit.  I was not disappointed.  The chicken was so soft and tender.  Very tasty.  The toast was soooooooo good I could eat ten of those if it didn't make me gain weight.  They gave plenty of fries but I didn't eat that all.  The coleslaw was very tasty also.  I was very happy to find somewhere that sells sweet tea that didn't taste like medicine.  Service:  Was very pleasant and quick, they brought our food to the table.  I saw the staff cleaning up right away after someone leaves.  They fill and clean the drinks, utensils, sauces a lot.  Parking:  There was a lot of parking available at the shopping center."}
{"text":"This place specializes in chicken strips. Each meal comes with chicken strips, the dipping sauce, fries, and a delicious piece of moist, buttered bread.   The chicken strips are crispy and delicious. And the sauce compliments the chicken so well. The fries are fries. Haha. But the bread is so good especially with the butter. My brother got our bread buttered on both sides. I would actually not get that, personally, because my bread was a little too salty for my liking. I also got a Fresh-Squeezed Lemonade which was outstanding. Definitely quenched my thirst. And they have the good ice that is kinda crushed, which I love.   I think for the three piece chicken meal, it was $6.19. So not a bad price. Definitely one of my top fast food places to go to now! Too bad I don't have one near me. :("}
{"text":"It's chicken fingers,and theirs are incredible. I love the sauce, but I usually sub out the bread for extra sauce.   and the sweet tea is awesome, but a little too sweet for me, I usually ask for half sweet tea and half regular!"}
{"text":"My son loves this place. I'm so glad they built one close to our house. The one on S. LV Blvd was close to but this one is closer. They can be a lil slow some times but lately they haven't been. They do get busy. I will definitely be back often. Thanks for always pleasing my son!"}
{"text":"There was a time when I went to Canes 2 - 3 a times week for a month. Oh boy, did I have a grand time. It's different now. Don't get me wrong, it's wonderful.. but my taste buds have become tolerant.. I guess I blame myself. Anything you choose off the menu's gorgeous.. I wouldn't try the burger though.. Save that for In-N-Out later.  You can also swap items such as coleslaw for Canes sauce or extra toast. Which I also do because I'm not a coleslaw-er.. lol"}
{"text":"It's bomb. Get a box combo, switch out the cole slaw, and bring me the other canes sauce.  UNLV students, don't forget to show your Rebelcard and get that discount. At this location only!"}
{"text":"Eat here once a week. The food is great. The service is friendly. The drive thru is fast. All in all it is a A+"}
{"text":"Fried chicken STRIPS?! I'm down. They make the strips super moist and super crispy, two things I did not expect from chicken strips. Their sauce is bomb and addicting. The combos are pretty hefty so beware and share :)"}
{"text":"Looking for good food that doesnt break your wallet like everything else in Vegas? Well, this is definitely the place to go.  Discovered this past weekend, I paid $5.99 for 3 chicken fingers, texas toast, fries and a drink.  Don't underestimate this meal, it actually will make you full. Included with the chicken fingers is their famous Cane sauce which reminds me of the spread at In-N-Out. So delicious, you want it in every bite. I even dipped the toast in it. Located on Las Vegas Blvd so if you're coming from California, make sure to stop by this place before you check into your hotel (and when you're heading back too).   Really good, satisfying food. Will definitely go again because it's cheap and worth it! Better than Chick fil A in my opinion. Only because their sauce and bread makes them unique!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the drive- thru service is poor. They always get my order wrong, dont know if the guy is listening or not. I am speaking clearly, order the box combo, instead they think I ordered multiple orders of the three finger combo or something else. Then I have to sit there for awhile until they figure things out because its incorrect and the bill is higher than whatI am expecting. Think I am done going to this location for awhile.  One last word... Listen to the customer and verify the order to make sure its correct so you dont mess the order up. Dont speak so fast either, I can hardly understand whats being said because they speak 1000 words a second... Slow down..."}
{"text":"I've heard about Raising Cane's for awhile, but never made the trip out to the one in the OC, so when I came to Vegas, had to stop by when I passed by.  Located in the same plaza as the Target, maybe a 5-10 minute drive from the strip. Came on a Tuesday around 1 PM, it was busy, but the lines moved quickly.  They're famous for their chicken strips, so I had to get their most popular combo, The Box Combo. It comes with 4 chicken fingers, a piece of texas toast, some fries, cole slaw, and a side of the Cane sauce. After you order, you sit down, when it's ready, they'll call out your name, and bring your food to you! Great service!  The chicken fingers are DELICIOUS! Probably some of the best chicken fingers I've had. Super crispy on the outside, but still moist on the inside. The Cane sauce is pretty good, it's pretty peppery, which I liked, but other than that I couldn't really taste a flavor, maybe it was kind of tangy? All I know is that it's good with the chicken! The rest of the box is average. Fries were whatever, and the toast didn't blow me away. It was buttery and toasty, but not superb. Cole slaw wasn't the best, next time I'll be subbing the cole slaw for extra sauce!  Overall, great fast food place, definitely worth the trip out if you're visiting Vegas. It's also cheaper than most of the food you'll find on the strip!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I guess that's not going to happen. The food wasn't that great but the service was good.  The chicken was very dry and the fries were nothing special. And their special sauce is nothing special, it's just mayo, ketchup, and pepper. At least that's what it tasted like to me.  They don't have much of a selection. I think there only 3 different types of meals you can choose from. I wish they had some meals that have dark meat.  The Texas toast was the only thing that was enjoyable. It was fluffy and lightly toasted.  We went through the drive through and it took a very long time to get the food and then we almost didn't get our drinks. And then we get drinks and they aren't the right ones.   All the employees were very friendly. They get 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Good chicken fingers, but a whole reataurant dedicated to them? Hard to believe but true.  The sauces are tasty and they do sanwiches with. The fingers too. Its just, how many times a week can you eat chicken fingers? I mean, its not PIZZA!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but nothing special.  If you are going to specialize in only 1 item it should be GREAT!  The chicken fingers are average... Not bad but wouldn't go back.  The Texas toast was good"}
{"text":"Really. I have experienced better.... called Chick-Fil-A.   So many people have told me about how AH-mazing Raising Cane's is. I have yet to be impressed. The chicken has very little flavor, and the fries are absolutely bland. It only has helped they have really good Cane's sauce... if they would just not charge so much for extra sauce. I probably would return only if I was really hungry or there was a plethora of Cane's Sauce to dunk everything in.   I appreciate their employee's good service, but that doesn't make up for sub-par food."}
{"text":"A couple of friends who were celebrating their birthdays in Vegas over the weekend wanted to try Raising Cane's for lunch. There are multiple locations around Vegas, but this one was the closest to us and off-strip.  I had no idea Raising Cane's was fast food and didn't know what to expect. The place was packed around 1:30 pm and we got into line, which moved quickly. They specialize in chicken fingers, so there aren't many options. I decided on The Box Combo, which included four chicken fingers, Texas toast, coleslaw, crinkle-cut fries their famous Cane's sauce, and a regular drink for $7. It was more than enough food for me and I couldn't finish the fries or slaw. The chicken tenders came in huge pieces and were super filling, although a bit dry on the inside but the yummy Cane's sauce helped with that.  Service was awful. The cashier who rang me up was clueless, distracted, and rude. I asked her what was in the coleslaw and she straight up giggled and said, \"I don't know.\" I just looked at her, thinking she'd ask a manager or provide some other response, but nope; all I got back was a blank stare. Okay... After that lovely exchange, she seemed completely disinterested in me and kept making googly eyes at this guy behind me, who I assume she personally knew, and basically had a side conversation with him while I was trying to order.  Overall, Raising Cane's reminds me of another chain, Chicken Now, as they're pretty much on the same playing field. To be honest, I'd rather go to McDonald's (guilty pleasure) than come here again, but I wouldn't be opposed if friends wanted to come back. But before then, I'd like to try Strip 'N Dip Chicken Strips next time since I've had that bookmarked for awhile."}
{"text":"I feel like I could eat here everyday, but alas once a week is fine. I love their chicken so much haha it's definitely worth your time, taste and money. Their sweet tea is good but I personally have to water it down. Come on in!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent chicken, excellent piece of bread, the hot sauce is really really hot I love it but I do think they should give you a dipping sauce for every two pieces of chicken. You can add another $.31 for every extra dipping sauce for the chicken.  one dipping sauce container is not enough for four pieces of really thick chicken. Coleslaw is a little bland could use some seasoning but all in all it's better than KFC."}
{"text":"I think of all the places that serve fried chicken fingers, this is the best. I ordered the combo which had 4 pieces of chicken, fries, cole slaw, Texas toast, and a drink. What makes the chicken so good is their sauce which is unlike all the other places that offer ranch, sweet and sour, or bbq. Their sauce is their own made. The cole slaw was pretty good too though I had to sprinkle some salt and pepper. I really like their Texas toast which is grilled on only one side. I wish they would open one closer to where I live in Pasadena (hint, hint)"}
{"text":"Chicken tenders from Raising Came are some of the best out there! We were leaving LV and needed something to eat on the drive back home. And so I got a kids meal ($4.50) that came with 2 chicken tenders, their special sauce, crinkly fries, a sippy cup with a fountain drink, and a lame sticker activity. The tenders are a little small but who cares they're so crispy and good especially with that bomb sauce. Even though I'm supposed to be a grown adult they still let me get it and this served as a nice snack.  If you just want the tenders you can buy them in bulks of 25 (so 50, 75, 100+) a la carte. Or if you want a combo they have those too that come with their special toast and fries."}
{"text":"Came in last night with the family and food still lives up to its reputation. Not much have changed except the prices went up for 2015 and the chicken got smaller. Not too sure what the deal is with that but I sure hope it goes back to how the portion sizes were before. I would still go to this location but would seek a different option for the price."}
{"text":"Best chicken strips I've ever had. The bread was delicious too. We need these in California!"}
{"text":"I love Raising Caine's! These guys are fast even when they get suuuper busy. They're located close to the University so they are always full of people. With that said, I wish their restaurant was bigger. It sucks when you can't sit down and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"I love Raising Cane's. Their chicken is so tender and the sauce is to die for!  The staff in this location are suuuuper friendly!"}
{"text":"So far my favorite Raising Cane's location. I love Raising Cane's, so I will walk in to one even if it's a cardboard box with a R.C's sign on it. Their food is good no matter what, so I rate the restaurants based on the staff and their service. These guys in this location are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Not intentionally planned, but Raising Cane's somehow became my first food stop during my last trip to Vegas.  I have had it bookmarked for quite some time and just happened drive by it when I was looking for a Target store.  Also, I've been fascinated by how the chicken strip game in Vegas is pretty strong with Raising Cane's and Strip N Dip.  So I had to try it to see if it was worth the hype.  And it was!  I ordered the Box Combo (http://bit.ly/2ljiNaq) which included four Chicken Fingers, crinkle-cut Fries, Cane's Sauce, Texas Toast, coleslaw, and a drink.  The chicken strips were huge, crispy, and juicier than I expected.  Also tasted good when dipping in Cane's Sauce which is like a tangy-er version of Chik-Fil-A's Signature Sauce.  Good stuff!  And I was surprised how buttery the Texas Toast was.  It almost tasted like brioche.  Overall it was a very filling and satisfying meal.  I was pretty stuffed after.  If I'm ever craving chicken strips when I'm back in Vegas, I would definitely consider going back to Raising Cane's again just because it is conveniently located near the Strip.  I still have to try Strip N Dip, so I can't say which is better, but after this one visit to Raising Cane's, I'm convinced that the Vegas' Chicken Strip game is strong no matter where you go."}
{"text":"Heck Yes! OMG, this place! I'm kinda addicted. Chicken is moist, love the fries, and that toast! I avoided coming here and trying the food (due to a misconception on my part, I thought it was going to be a greasy repeat of some other chicken joint) but no. Canes is very good!"}
{"text":"I don't know about you but I really love this place! The chicken is phenomenal and the sides are pretty decent. The sauce is catchy and they have more than just your typical soda. Love the sweet tea and their lemonade. Be prepared, this place is always a madhouse especially when the kids are stopping by for some lunch. Even with the rush, they push out some chicken fairly quick. If you haven't tried Canes, perhaps it's time to leave your house or moms basement and see what this place is all about."}
{"text":"Ordered the three finger combo. The chicken was soft and juicy. The Oreda-type fries were crispy. The Texas toast was good. The Cane dipping sauce was very delicious. The service was fast and friendly. Will come back again."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever trying Raising Cane's and boy, have I been missing out! I ordered the Caniac Combo and it sure included a whole lot more food than I expected. It included 6 chicken tenders, fries, coleslaw, Texas toast and a drink...oh and how could I forget the delicious Cane's sauce! As far as the customer service goes, I was pretty blown away. They were so welcoming, friendly and patient. You can definitely tell they enjoy what they do! All in all, I highly recommend everyone (especially if you're a chicken tender addict like myself) to go and eat here! Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is unbelievably good. Never been disappointed. They're fast, simple, and so worth the price. Always come here every time I'm in town. I have had everything from the menu and it's all fresh. Crunchy, hot, and juicy. Love how they give you a nice toasted bread. Now the sauce... normally I like things plain but the sauce is soooooo good. Can't wait to try to recreate it :)  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Cane's is probably my favorite fast food joint.  They don't taste greasy like fast food, but they do have a drive thru.  Everything tastes fresh, and they keep it simple, only one thing on the menu: chicken fingers and crinkle fries.  They do one thing and they do that one thing perfectly.  Never greasy, not even the fries, never dry, never bland....they are just always delicious, even the Texas toast is surprisingly delicious!  You can't go wrong, get the 3 piece box, ask for extra Cane's sauce, and enjoy some sweet tea!"}
{"text":"Great food! \"OK\" service. Didn't have plastic knives which is kind of sad considering your a restaurant. Seems to not be ran as good as some of the other ones I have been too. Worth the visit but maybe a different location."}
{"text":"Awesome! Came here early and it was already packed but food came out quickly.  The chicken fingers are just chicken fingers but the sauce, toast and fries are what makes this place amazing.  It is definitely no Chick-fil-A but still a great 2nd place.  They charge for extra sauce and lemonade refills (Chick-fil-A does neither).  Other than that it is a great place to grab some food!"}
{"text":"The chicken is soggy. The fries are soggy. Everything is deep-fried and horrible for me.  So why do I find myself here at least once a week? There's something that keeps drawing me back to Cane's. Maybe it's the sauce. Maybe it's the super-moist chicken. It's probably not the always-friendly and borderline overly-enthusiastic employees, but they're certainly a nice bonus.  Once I dip the chicken (and the fries, and the toast) into the Cane's sauce, any complaints of sogginess go out the window and all I want is more sauce. The fresh-squeezed lemonade and reasonable prices ($6.29 for three fingers, fries, toast, and a drink) are also appreciated.  Even though nothing really stands out as mind-blowingly good, I find myself addicted to this little fast food chain."}
{"text":"Went there as soon as they opened was so so fresh and hot service is great.i do recommend to anyone and everyone"}
{"text":"Uninspiring. Good location though, right down the street from the game stop where I took my son before coming here and surprise surprise half the people I saw at the game stop were here which allowed me to further cement my point. See, if all you do is eat crap and play video games all day you will end up like all the fat losers in this place. Menu was extremely limited. Better like canes sauce or ketchup because those are your choices. The Cole slaw was sloppy and smelled and tasted like it was made with elmers glue. The chicken was freshly cooked though...."}
{"text":"Box combo is a perfect amount of food. 4 fingers, slaw, fries, Texas toast and a drink for around $7. Fresh cooked to order non frozen chicken fingers!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't heard of Raising Cane's until I moved to Vegas but man have I been missing out! Generally speaking, restaurants that have a smaller menu result in them being really good at the dew items they specialize in. Raising Cane's is definitely one of those.   The sauce is KEY. The chicken is nice and tender and always comes fresh. When chicken tenders have 90% breading and 10% actually chicken it angers me to no extent. But knowing that every time I come here, I'm going to get a healthy hunk of chicken under that crispy breading makes me sleep so much better at night.   If you haven't tried it, try it."}
{"text":"Seriously?.. Why so much complaining? I think it's great for fast food! Would you rather eat chicken rubber selects from Mickey D's instead? Didn't think so. Raising Canes is legit!"}
{"text":"Great new location. Very friendly and attentive staff. Food was awesome, I love the way they cook up their chicken fingers. Good value too. Me and my wife shared a 6 piece meal with the texas bread and slaw. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's always has great food quality and taste and a great dipping sauce for their chicken.  This location is right on St. Rose Parkway which is a great location - it's out of the way of Eastern Ave. traffic.  The four or six piece meal is the way to go. It has fries, coleslaw, and a piece of bread as well as their dipping sauce.  The wife always likes to get the lemonade even though it's a little more expensive - and it's great!"}
{"text":"The most delicious chicken fingers I've ever had. Very soft and crunchy, and fries so good they compare to homemade ones. Idk what they put on their sauce but it's so good. We definitely need more of this back east."}
{"text":"I like Raising Canes but only go there when my friends drag me there or if it's free at school. Or when I just don't care about being healthy.   The chicken is really good and crispy. Small, but 3 pieces plus the toast, fries, and slaw will make you full. I don't ever get the slaw, I just ask for more fries. And speaking of the fries...  Seriously, what's up with the fries? It's like those fries you can just microwave. Really nothing special at all and what amazes me is that I would rather eat McDonald's French fries (& I hate McDonald's). Maybe if there fries were better I would actually wanna come here more often.   & the sauce to me isn't worth another 20 something cents. It's really good but please just give us that shit for free to make up for the tasteless fries.   On the other hand, I do love me some Texas toast! Nice, buttery, crispy and high cholesterol toast. I could eat that all day.   There's no hype for me about the sweet tea though. It's just sweet. A bit too sweet for my taste so I mix it with unsweetened.   I don't come here often, but when I do, I make sure it's when idgaf about eating tons of oily goodness. Fix those fries first and start giving out free sauce, then we'll talk."}
{"text":"People are nice, food is AMAZING! There is no reason not to love this place! I get the box combo, minus the coleslaw and an extra canes sauce! HIghly recommend and if u are skeptical about coming, do it!"}
{"text":"This place is just so BOMB!!! like literally all of the food on the menu is just amazing. They should open up more branches because I can eat there for days."}
{"text":"Great fast food sauce...hence SAUCE. The sauce is absolutely fantastic, most especially for a fast food joint. The chicken was bland, but perfectly cooked. The fries were absolutely atrocious. The bread was okay. The sweet tea tastes more like syrup rather than the classic smooth sweet tea that I remember from Alabama.  The sauce was so good I couldn't stop eating...I was originally going to save it for later :(...as soon as my sauce ran out I threw the rest away, because the fries were just that bad."}
{"text":"The cole slaw and fries are really good.  The chicken tenders were soggy."}
{"text":"Love love love. I would eat here every day if I were skinny. The chicken is fried just right and the cold slaw is to die for. I just want to order cold slaw and toast."}
{"text":"Chicken so good make you wanna slap your momma! Twitter fingers turned into chicken fingers . The freshest chicken you'll get from a fast food chain . Don't bother adding more then just the box . Oh , grab a gallon of Iced Tea ;)   Thank me later"}
{"text":"So I really wanted to try their sweet tea because people have told me it's the best, and it definitely was!!! I did love the service, very clean and new, not over crowded and neat overall. The only problem is the music they played the entire time, which made me feel as if I was at Chuck E. Cheese. Nothing but Hannah Montana. For the disco ball in the room we should be listening to music up to date, here are a few recommendations: Remedy, Bro Safari, Vanic, Dash Berlin, or Andain. I will definitely come back, but I really wish the music was better than what was played today :("}
{"text":"Love Cane's but this one tends to be really busy & served chicken does not taste very fresh at peak hours"}
{"text":"This place had a party for their people on Labor Day!!!! Others made them work. I support and say good things about places like this. Coming to eat good and hot.  Lancelot Davis"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Canes. A must try. Get extra Cane sauce I usually get 10. So I can have some to put on my food the next couple days. Goes great with steak!"}
{"text":"The chicken is so juicy and fresh!  Fries are nice and crispy. Sweet tea is a little sweet, but with ice, tastes great.  Service is friendly and they offer military discounts.    Sometimes drive-thru can get backed-up, but they try to move it along as fast as possible.  At least the food is always hot, so for me, it's worth the wait!  :-)"}
{"text":"They have the best fries chicken I've ever tasted! They have amazing prices, MY boyfriend and I share the 6 piece combo and it fills us up. That's 2 people getting fed for under 10$ and we have a lady on here complaining about their prices... Are you insane? For the quality of food and quantity you get pretty unbeatable pricing over other fast food places with horrid food."}
{"text":"Friendly service and good food, the chicken was moist and tasty, and make sure your rolls are B.O.B.S. they bring your food to your table for you, just make sure you bus yourself afterwards. I would give it 5 stars, but parking was rough, being in a strip mall parking lot."}
{"text":"Place is clean. Food is decently priced.  Chicken is nicely cooked. Dipping sauce taste like fry sauce and old bay seasoning. Toast is good. Fries are nothing special (crinkle cut).  Ice tea is really good.   Not amazing but nice for fast food."}
{"text":"Oh my god, a place that specializes in chicken strips, yesyesyesyesyesyes.  This place is as straight up as it can be. Chicken strips, fries, texas toast and a drink. Only thing that separates everything on the menu is, how hungry are you?   Chicken strips, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, fries, perfectly crispy, toast, is well, toast. Yay. BUT THE SAUCE. The sauce is the key basically to the meal. Put it over everything, I'm not lying. Its obviously for the chicken, but dip your fries in it and dip your toast in it. Take shots of it if anything.  please, open one of these in NorCal, I'd absolutely appreciate it."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I said after my first time eating Canes in a different area, I'd never come back. Then I got a job around the corner and started coming to this one. Now I'm hooked!!!!!!! And the bread!!!!!!!! Oh my goodness! I can't say anything bad about it!!!!!! If I had a car I'd be there almost every day. The staff is always nice and are always willing to crack jokes with me and my co workers. Yes my fat loves this place!"}
{"text":"Treat yourself, Don't cheat yourself...  If you haven't gone to Raising Cane's yet please take the time to do so.  I'm ashamed to admit it but on my last visit to Cane's I ordered a Caniac which is 6 pieces of chicken tenders, crinkle cut French fries, Texas toast, and it normally comes with coleslaw, but I always substitute it for another piece of Texas toast...and I ate the whole thing in one sitting :( lol.  I absolutely love their freshly squeezed lemonade, and one trick I do to make sure I enjoy every drop of it is ask for no ice because if you don't they will surely serve you ice with a shot of lemonade.  Learn from my experience. Everything else is great.  Also make sure you don't go during lunch time if you want to have the best experience ever."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time today.  The customer service was great.  The gal that took my order (I can't remember her name although she offered it) was very helpful explaining the menu.  The food was yummie and the service quick.  I like it!!"}
{"text":"my vegas trip is never complete without a taste of canes before i leave! i LOVE their chicken fingers and their sauce. the fries are sooo delish! the service is usually pretty good. great fast food joint to get away from the strip! =)"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to this chain. Menu is limited, but food is delicious! You do have to ask for lemonade at the counter. It does cost a little bit extra, but very worth it. The general manager was great, running around encouraging his employees. Place was clean, food was great and employees were friendly"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken fingers!  The sauce is awesome with the fry's also. The ice for the drinks isn't the big cubed ice. Best fast food chicken fingers in town."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Raising Cane's, so I decided to try it out for myself today for lunch.  I ordered the Chicken Sandwich Combo w/Fries & a Bottle of Water and I ordered two Chicken Strips on the side.  Since I ordered it to dine in, they gave me a receipt and said they would bring it out to my table.  While I was waiting for my meal, I looked around and saw many customers enjoying their food.  I must be getting old because I felt like the music was way too loud in the restaurant.  After a short wait the girl who took my order brought my food out.  I tried a few of the Fries first....they are the crinkled variety.....they were good, but not great.  Next I bit into the Chicken Sandwich.....***Caution, the Chicken is extremely hot***  I burned the hell out of my mouth with that first bite.....the Chicken must have come right out of the fryer.  Wow!  I couldn't taste anything because my taste buds were wiped off the face of the Earth!  I munched on a few more Fries while I waited for the Chicken to cool down a bit.  After a few minutes I finished the rest of the Sandwich and thought it was good....but again, not great.  The Sauce in the Sandwich was the highlight.  The Chicken was just OK.....was kind of bland to me.  I then tried the 2 Chicken Strips I ordered on the side.....again, I thought they were kind of bland.  The quality of the Chicken was very good though.....nice, tender White Meat Chicken....just not enough flavor for my tastes.  Will I return?  Probably not....it just didn't \"Wow\" me."}
{"text":"Love the chiken always fresh and fast. Service is good even though they are busy especially on the weekends, i love that they bring the food to your table and always are paying attention to the customer service. great spot my kids love it too."}
{"text":"The employees are always professional and very courteous I love the upbeat spirit in this place!!! The employees are very happy to serve you and the food is good. Way to go Raising Cane, teach classes to the rest of the nearby fast food places."}
{"text":"Best service ever very friendly love this fast food eatery. Love the tenders piping hot and fresh. Fries crispy and fresh."}
{"text":"The food is the bomb! I usually don't like fried chicken but this place makes it so tender and delicious!! Great food and great prices!! Best fried chicken sandwich in town They only do combos but the prices are great You get a 3 chicken fingers sandwich, fries and a drink for only 5 bucks.... you can't beat that"}
{"text":"I thought I would give it a try since everyone says how good it is. Not the case. Chicken was super greasy and too much breading. Fries were cold and soggy. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the service was good."}
{"text":"The chicken is excellent, but the coleslaw is horrid, and the fries even worst.  They have to know how terrible the slaw and fries are...just sayin'. We get only the chicken and go to Popeye's, or KFC for fries and slaw.  I wish the owner cared enough to step up to the plate and get better slaw and fries!"}
{"text":"I am fortunate to live less than a block away from a Raisin Canes, and I go there often. Best fried chicken *ever*. Seriously, you just have to try it. Plus, I get a teacher discount, so I eat there more often than I care to think about. The price is reasonable, the fries are good, and the Texas toast is to die for. If you use the drive through and there is a dog with you, they give you a treat in a little bag. And my favorite part is the staff are always friendly and happy. I go about once a week, they are inerrantly cheerful. Seems like they really like the place, and the mood in the restaurant is very positive."}
{"text":"This is the closest to my mothers Fried chicken I will ever experience. This chicken brings me back to my childhood. This is absolutely delicious. So juicy. So fresh. Simply delicious. I love this place, and you will too!"}
{"text":"Canes is bomb. If your looking for quick, delicious tasting chicken, this is your spot. All they do is chicken. Sometimes the drive thru can be long but that's when I sneak inside for a quick grab and go. The ice for their drinks is something special too. Won't stop going here for a while."}
{"text":"Love these chicken strips! So yummy! I need a barrel of the canes sauce in my kitchen so I can dunk everything I eat in it! Never been inside. Always drive through but it's quick my order is always right & my food is still hot & delicious when I get it home to eat it!"}
{"text":"My travels have produced many casual passes of these locations around the country, but I never really knew what they were about until my friends on Yelp helped me out.  So, I decided to swing by here to grab a small lunch on the way to the airport.  Unfortunately, none of their meal deals look like a \"small lunch.\" Especially one that could be eaten on the move.  I did go inside to check out the menu at my own pace, and the store was a 9 on a scale of 1-10 in terms of the madhouse factor. All tables packed, kids screaming with no parental control and just an atmosphere I want nothing to do with on this planet.  Even an attempt to wash my hands upon entering the restaurant was not successful as both restroom doors were locked and apparently require a key from the front counter. Honestly, this is the first time I have ever experienced this at a fast food restaurant anywhere. Gas station off a highway, yes? Fast food restaurant in the city limits, nope.  While there was chaos from the customers (except the guys who work at UNLV athletics who were behind me in line), the employees were calm, friendly and got me in and out the door fast!  My \"small lunch\" comprised of two chicken fingers, a piece of Texas toast and the sauce. This was the first time I'd ever seen a dipping sauce on the menu at an additional price, but it obviously is one of their signature items and it had a zesty flavor. The Texas toast was also tasty, but I found the chicken fingers kind of average in size and flavor on their own without the sauce.  My fast food needs going forward will likely be satisfied by other options, and I certainly will not be walking into this particular Raising Cane's again for decent chicken and that locked bathroom."}
{"text":"Best chicken strips and the Cane's Sauce is soooo good! My favorite is to just get the chicken sandwich with extra sauce when I am not in the mood for fries. It is super tasty and hits the spot when I have a craving. A quick and easy meal!"}
{"text":"Wish they were closer but love having a location near pv mall so if in the area we grab food. Sauce is delicius that comes with the chicken. We end up getting one extra. We haven't been inside just yet. End up going through the drive through but it looks pretty clean. Employees are nice. Never had an issue."}
{"text":"favorite chicken finger place ever.... cane sauce and texas toast are amazing. always eat here everytime i go to vegas"}
{"text":"This is the best chicken strips on the Las Vegas strip! The sauce they give you to dip in is AMAZING!!! ALL the food to be honest is awesome!! Ill go to Canes any chance I get!"}
{"text":"Succulent and fresh chicken tenders that were not overpowered by heavy breading. The cane's sauce was sweet and peppery - delicious! Don't forget to ask for the Louisiana Hot Sauce - that really brings everything together.   Delicious crinkle cut fries! Just as another had suggested. I devoured all the fries.   Coleslaw tasted fresh and not overbearingly heavy on the mayo.  Overall, excellent chicken strips, but I can't do too much fried foods anyway without getting an upset stomach, so this will be saved for my once in a while fried foods indulgence :)"}
{"text":"I love coming to raising Cannes!!! I don't ever have an issue with my order and the food and service are always great."}
{"text":"It's very good and the employees are great.  I'm going to be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I landed in Vegas around noon and needed a quick bite to eat. This place didn't disappoint. I ordered the 2 piece combo which came with a piece of the yummiest texas toast for $5.99. Great service? Yes. Cheap & quick eats? Definitely. The BOMB sweet tea? Oh yeah!  I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Such horrible customer service at this location! I typically go to the one by campus . (ASU), but since relocating to this area, it makes more sense for me to come to this location. It never appears to fail, staff at the second window are always so RUDE! I get it, you hate your job. No one told you to stick around though. I'm going to start commutig back to the campus one, the quality of customer service is so much better!"}
{"text":"I think the kid could smell the Cane's on my breath. After I had my lunch at the other location, he begged me to take him there for dinner. So, this was the drive thru--not too busy, friendly staff. Kid got the three piece--no bread but extra fries instead. No idea how he learned that trick. He said the chicken was hot and 'perfect' Another first rate Cane's experience."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat. Ok maybe not for the diet conscious. But for those that like a low key ambiance with great chicken strips and sauce. Like omg. Seriously. Of course it's a college vibe with all the \"kids\".. ok, I'm old.. Anyways excellent staff, attentive, great service, and great food. So what if I ignored the Texas bread calling my name while the angel whispered \"you can't have it all, woman!\". Also ignored most of he frys. But hey, if you have THAT metabolism, or you're young.. well do it to it!!"}
{"text":"Yes, I know it's a chain. And yes, I know it's fast food. But wow, after moving back to the Bay Area, I really miss Raising Cane's. Most San Francisco Bay Area residents have no idea about Cane's, except for the younger ones who make yearly trips to Sin City. But, in the $5-$10 range, Cane's may be the most filling, albeit limited, fast food option.   The chicken strips are hot and crispy, but the meat is incredibly moist and succulent. That freshness aspect really sets it apart from other fast food joints. The crinkle fries, which I also ask for well-done, have that slightly salty favor that goes well with the strips. They offer a sweet, crunchy cole slaw and a buttered Texas toast, with both being great additions to your combos. And the sauce. Where do I begin with the sauce? A little tangy, a little spicy, and a whole lot of goodness. You have to try it to believe, or experience it for that matter. The sweet tea is perfect, not too sweet and ultimately refreshing. When eating in, patrons get as many refills for all beverages, even the sweet tea.  Oh Cane's, how good you've been to many tipsy and sober Las Vegas locals and visitors. Whether you're looking for a good-sized lunch or a alcohol-soaking, carb-filled meal, check out Cane's. It will surely not disappoint."}
{"text":"i wanted to give canes one last chance because honestly i've never been WOWED with their food but i went in with an open mind. after getting my three piece chicken combo i scarfed down almost all of it and found a HAIR in my fries. almost threw up that shit isn't cute. but i don't wanna get anyone's feelings so i just left my food. probs won't be returning :/"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Every time we are in Las Vegas we take our family there. I wish we had one here in Utah. Better than Zxaby's!!! The Canes sauce is awesome. It's all chicken. It's awesome!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for a fast food joint? Yes, Raising Cane's actually deserves 4 stars, but since they get involved with the community they are getting 5 stars from me! They support \"The Rebellion\" which is the UNLV student section. Since I am alumni, how could I not support a business giving back to my Alma mater especially since Cane's is from the south with not particular connection to the university other than being located across the street. They also give free kids meals to crowd members who watched a mountain west basketball or football game, just as long as the rebels WON. Just make sure to save your ticket from the game.  When this location first opened I did not understand the hype and actually thought they were pricey. Gave Canes a second chance and now I love it.  The batter is not too thick like most chicken finger places and you could tell these are freshly made and not frozen. Just like everyone else I too like the Texas toast because its soft and buttery. Nice touch with crinkle cut fries and Cane's sauce, which is delish. I also like the community/university vibe of this place especially after a basketball game. They also give 10% discount, but they will ask for student ID."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this place from other locals in town.  I was thinking to myself... how can chicken strips be THAT GOOD and what is this supposed CRACK SAUCE that is so good, you must order an extra sauce since they only give you just one?? The food did live up to the hype!! The menu is very small and limited, but that's ok.  You know what you are coming in for when you eat here.  The chicken strips were fresh and good quality white meat.  The \"fried-ness\" wasn't too greasy and made you feel sick from all the oil and grease.  The texas toast was fresh and crunchy, just the right amount of buttery goodness. Crinkle cut fries were on point! and this chicken sauce... HELL'S YEAH!!.. it tastes like a chipotle mayo ranch type sauce, definitely a ranch sauce with a small spicy kick! The customer service was very friendly as well and just a good fried chicken joint!! The take-out line was super busy too!! I will definitely be back to get my fried chicken fix next time!"}
{"text":"Canes never disappoints. I go here at least 3 times a month! The cane sauce can't be beat, and don't compare it to Chick Fil-A. There two totally different chicken strip joints! All I gotta say is don't be so stingy when I ask for Louisiana Hot Sauce. 3-5 packets doesn't cut it for a Caniac! Fork em out!"}
{"text":"Awful! Just straight awful. I'm not a health nut but serving 3 different starches in 1 meal is just crazy. The bread, fries and batter on the chicken strips is way too much. Not to mention the batter on the chicken strips is terrible. No flavor and it just all felt like too much. Never again."}
{"text":"The best fast food chicken period.....my family loves this place!!!"}
{"text":"Really good and fresh chicken.  I get the sandwich combo. Don't know what it is but the bun is really good. Ithe bun of the sandwich can make or break a place for me."}
{"text":"I give Raising Cane's 5 stars because the food is yummy and the service is always constantly on point.   The box combo is my favorite and the sweet tea is amazing.   The sauce is bomb.com :)"}
{"text":"If you love Chicken strips then I recommend this restaurant to you.   Here's why :) *The chicken taste so fresh, the batter is very light and crispy.  *The fries are very yummy. *Sweet tea is my favorite here. *The toast is delicious. *Price is very reasonable. *Customer service is always great. *Restaurant is nice & clean. *Fast & efficient. *Lastly, can't forget about the special sauce, OMG it is yummy in my tummy!   I would like to mention, I love how each restaurant represents the city of Las Vegas in their own ways. From supporting unlv's football team to having photo of supporting local events/teams in our community.   If your from California (like me) and love Chick-fil-A then you will LOVE cane's :) The 2 special sauces are very different; Chick-fil-A is sweet & Cane's is more tangy but over very delicious.   I hope this review helped you decide what to eat."}
{"text":"I go to this Cane's a few times a year, and I love it! Usually I eat a mostly vegetarian diet, but every once in a while I make an exception for Cane's. It's that good!   The lines here sometimes can get long (I've never seen one of their locations that doesn't occasionally have a long drive-through line) but the staff works quickly and the line always moves pretty fast.   The fried chicken is great, much better quality meat  than most chicken places. I'm usually not a fan of crinkle cut fries but I like them here! Probably because they come with the amazing Cane's sauce. (I always get an extra when I'm splitting the Caniac combo with my husband.)   Also, it's really nice that they offer 15% discounts for teachers that show a school badge. This year they even gave free box combos to teachers on Teacher Appreciation Day! It's a really nice gesture!"}
{"text":"Out of the 5 or so RCCF's around Las Vegas I like this location the best.  The staff here have always been friendlier than the other ones.  The chicken fingers as good as any...  Be a Caniac Maniac!!!"}
{"text":"We are talking about a chicken joint that is better than KFC, Popeye's, Chick-fil-A, etc.!  Albeit they only serve chicken fingers.  That's all right though cause if you do something you're the best in, then...it's all good. Raising Cane's definitely makes the best chicken fingers.  Their Texas Toast is the best too.  I've never quite tasted toast like Raising Cane's Texas Toast.  Yum! cannot describe it.  The cole slaw they offer is not bad either.  What makes Raising Cane's my favorite fast food joint though is their sauce.  The chicken fingers are good but the sauce makes it better.  Raising Cane's is also very kid friendly.  They offer a kid's combo that includes cool Raising Cane's stickers.  I also like the decor and atmosphere of RC.  It's much more laid back an friendlier than other fast food joints.  A note to some skeptics who like chicken nuggets better than RC's chicken fingers.  Do you know what nuggets are made of?  Is there a part of a chicken that is called \"nugget\"?  Chicken fingers are made from real deal breast meat.  The operative word being \"real\".  Open up your palate a little more people and truly try to experience the differences the world offers.  Raising Cane's is definitely different from other chicken joints I've been to.  I'll definitely continue to come back again and again!"}
{"text":"No seasoning on chicken tenders. Juicy but flavorless. Too costly. Not only did they get the order and correct it was a very expensive flavorless and just not worth the money"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here getting sidetracked by KFC and other tasty fast food options in the interim.  This is my closest Raising Cane's and the one at which I joined the Caniac Club and subsequently got a free box combo along with my membership card for doing so.  If I have to pay full price for chicken tenders (no coupons or specials available), then Raising Cane's is my preferred choice for overall flavor, portion size and the included side dishes. The chicken tenders are both larger, juicer and cooked to a higher state of perfection than the notably smaller variety being sold at PDQ.  On the other hand, PDQ does has a variety of tasty chicken sandwich options available in addition to its chicken tenders or nuggets while Raising Cane's is pretty much exclusively a chicken tenders establishment.  This is why I usually get most of my chicken tenders at Raising Cane's while my go-to location for truly tastebud-stimulating, deluxe chicken sandwiches is PDQ.  Since PDQ does regularly have 2 for 1 coupons available for their sandwiches and combo meals throughout the year, they do get a fair amount of my business whenever such a 50% off option is available.  Coupons are few and far between at Raising Cane's.  Note that PDQ also will give you a completely free combo meal of your choice (not just a 2 for 1!) on your birthday, while the best that Raising Cane's can do is a free drink."}
{"text":"Let me first say that as a Louisianian reviewing a popular Louisiana-based fast-food franchise, my review may be a bit askew because of our high expectations for taste and originality.  Canes has always been an unashamedly bland commercial rendition of fried chicken with a very limited offering of sauces to try. What they do have going for them is a clean, wholesome dine-in setting with timely and friendly service."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on 7/9/15. Their chicken strips were yummy better than Chic-fil-a (I don't eat there anymore). We enjoyed the Texas toast, fries and the Sweet tea was perfect in flavor and sweetness. The service was quick and friendly. Will be one of our go to spots when we go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Lewis is the best part about this place!! Talk about a manager that takes pride in his work! I had lunch here today and they were slammed. I have never been to a place and seen such hard work and care for his customers in my life. He went above and beyond today and he deserves a major raise, if he has not been given one already! Hats off to you! oh, food was delicious as usual!"}
{"text":"Confused as to how I asked for extra crispy chicken twice yet the chicken is not crispy. You may wanna talk to your night crew. Besides this 1 incident, Canes is love. Canes is life."}
{"text":"If you like chicken fingers this is the place to go. The dipping sauce was really good and the Texas toast had a good butter crunch. If you want something other than chicken fingers you have to go elsewhere - that is really all they do. But they are really good."}
{"text":"Good chicken. Wish they had hot BBQ sauce or something. Coke machine wasn't very carbonated."}
{"text":"This is our first time here and the food that we ordered was a pretty small portion for $8. Although, their fountain drink was VERY good AND my chicken was FRESH."}
{"text":"No complaints.. All friendly service and fresh food!! Only downfall are the bums that hang around there...."}
{"text":"Food is basic canes always what you expect so it's good but the thing that got me is how shady the employees are at this location. They have promo tickets on the drink and the 2 drinks I ordered have already been peeled half way to see the prizes. I've never seen this level of scumbaggery from a fast food joint before. Tip to the management get it together! If something as simple as this goes bad I wonder what the hell else could be going on. Sadly I won't be returning to this location. Your staff is quite shady!"}
{"text":"I should have just stayed home and baked some dinosaur nuggets... Chicken fingers (only) and lame employees. I ordered the sandwich hoping to get something different then just chicken fingers, but no, they just slapped 3 chicken fingers between a bun and called it a chicken sandwich...   The employees dont speak at all either and they mad dog you when you place your order.... My kids like the place and is the reason for the 2 stars ( one for each kid), but what kid doesn't appreciate fried garbage..  If only they had a disco ball.... oh wait they do!!!"}
{"text":"We tried Raising Canes by accident when a friend had some take-out at a UFC party. It was freaking fantastic! We went by and scooped some up for dinner tonight and was once again totally amped. The chicken, which is delightfully fried - was so succulent. Ridiculously juicy strips is what we're talking about here. The meals come with fries, texas toast and cole slaw - but I'm in it for the chicken. It's awesome and is definitely on my favorite to-go list :)"}
{"text":"Amazing the food is great and always fresh and tasty i recommend the 3 peace meal you will love it!"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's just raised the bar for chicken strips to heights I never fathomed reachable for this familiar finger food.  Chicken strips, chicken tenders- call them what you will. The name won't add any juice or flavor to these boneless pieces of white meat, coated in bread crumbs then deep-fried to mask their dry texture and dull nature.  Ironically, in the middle of the parched Nevada desert, I found the moistest chicken strips I've ever had. The chicken was coated in a crunchy cover of breading and broke apart lightly. It came with an orange-colored, slightly tangy secret sauce that might have been some house version of thousand island.   The crinkle-cut fries were cooked medium to medium-well, slightly crispy on the outside; ordinary, but they fulfill their purpose as a filler. The Texas toast was a unique surprise, a thick slice of buttery brioche slightly toasted outside while fluffy as feathers on the inside.   The menu at this small fast-food chain from Louisiana is simple: 3 pieces (The 3 Finger), 4 pieces (The Box), 6 pieces (The Caniac), or 3 pieces inside a Kaiser roll (The Sandwich). All come with the toast, fries, and a drink; the 4 and 6-piece combos also have the addition of coleslaw.   I got the 3 Finger Combo which was a good-sized lunch. For 6 bucks and some change, I learned that chicken tenders can be tender, and that food can be fast and affordable and still fit the bill for great grub."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Cane's and will continue to come, but the manager or the supervisor, whoever he is, is very rude. The manager is a punk ass who thinks it's okay to be rude to his customers. From what I saw too, he was very lazy and got upset when someone else helped him out. Please do not take this the wrong way, do come enjoy a meal here! But just be wary of the manager."}
{"text":"So I just went to this canes around 1:30, I waited in the line for like 15 minutes only to get cold food and watered down sweet tea. This was absolutely terrible. Recommend not going there around late night unless you're down for lukewarm food. This canes doesn't display how canes really is and should be ashamed of this location. Beyond disappointed & wasted 15 dollars on the worst after work dinner for my girlfriend and I that we were looking forward to."}
{"text":"Sweet tea and toast is the bomb and this place is famous for chicken! A lil pricey though, but good food. I still like chik-fil-a better."}
{"text":"Looking for cheap and good food after a long weekend in Vegas? Well, this is the place you're looking for!   I got the three chicken strip combo that came with a drink, fries and buttery bread! OMG...the bread is delicious!! You have to dip the bread in the sauce they give you. It's amazing...TRUST ME, YOU WON'T REGRET IT! And the sweet tea is just perfect too! It goes great with the whole meal!   I'm definitely going back when I'm in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Well I don't usually eat fast food unless it's the only option but I do have to say I love Cane's. Love the fact that they are very simple and they have their own special sauce for their tenders. Without their sauce the chicken tenders just wouldn't be the same. Everything was super fresh and hot. They also have the option for huge family orders which is great for parties or game days. They have really good tea and lemonade and sell it by the jug too. Love their toast that comes with the meals. Service and prices are great and it is definitely not a normal fast food place which is why I will only eat here for fast food and not anywhere else.  You definelty have to try the sauce with the tenders!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of fried foods, but I'll be damned if these aren't the best chicken fingers ever.  Lightly breaded so it doesn't feel super unhealthy, insanely delicious dipping sauce, and accompanying texas toast that's just perfect.  One of my bosses gets a platter of fingers once in a blue moon, and it's always one of my favorite meals.  Not sure why I'm not eating here more often."}
{"text":"The chicken is average at best and the lack of sauce selection is extremely disappointing.  The sauce flavor is not my thing and the selection of meals is far too small.   I recommend going to PDQ instead. Their chicken, menu and sauce options are amazing and the flavor of everything far exceeds Canes."}
{"text":"Holy crap. I have never had more delicious chicken fingers in my life. And the sauce! Not to mention the bread! It's dangerous that this place is right next to where I work!"}
{"text":"\"Hey! \"Don't listen to a word I say \"Hey! \"The screams all sound the same \"Hey!\"  \"Though the truth may vary \"this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore\"  --------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------  It is a chain and the same food is offered here as everywhere else the company operates. We're not here to discuss the food ...  Although, I must mention that the coleslaw is close to inedible. You may think the truth may vary on this account; however, you will be finding that you are sorely mistaken. Coleslaw's nasty.  What are we here to talk about then if not the food?   --------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------  Service The service at this Raising Cane's is exceptional for a fast food chain. They are usually so friendly, they might even inch out In-N-Out for friendliest service in this category. They have employees cleaning other patrons' messes (more on that later), bringing patrons their food, retrieving patrons' finished trays, et al. They are truly best in show (ahem, pun intended) when it comes to service to customer. Which leads to ...  Customers I have never met a bigger group of obnoxiously loud, rude, messy people. Not in an elementary school cafeteria will one run into such mayhem. They leave enormous messes on tables, under tables, on seats, under seats, et al. They are the loudest day and night, weekday and weekend.   The first time I patronised this location, I imagined it was because teens from a nearby school come here to act like idiots. \"Damn, these kids really need to get the fuck out of here\" is what I thought. It was not the kids.   It is epidemic. It does not matter what time of day I visit. This location consistently has a cockfighting ring aspect to the ambiance in terms of noise and messiness. The employees are running around trying to clean all the preposterous messes left behind; however, it is a losing battle.   This location is a lost cause.   --------------------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------  I don't expect enough peace and quiet to be able to meditate at any fast food establishment.

{"text":"Came here for the first time yesterday and it was delicious! Chicken was juicy and tender. I like how the menu options are small and not too overwhelming. We went thru the drive thru and they didn't offer us any sauce or anything but if they had hot sauce it would have been perfect. The cane sauce was okay nothing special. We will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is the best thing ever and I love coming to this place. The food is by far amazing and I love how they are very fast and efficient with your order and service. I hear they are opening up one on St Rose Pkwy right by my house and I am super excited for that to happen. They have the best chicken tenders, in my opinion, and they have the best sauce as well. That Cane's sauce is to die for and I love using it with your chicken, Texas toast, and fries. You can't even beat their prices at all. They give you about four chicken tenders, fries, Texas toast and a drink for about $7. That is a pretty amazing deal to me!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the box combo. Perfect combo of chicken fingers, slaw, fries, and bread. Love the dipping sauce. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Nice fried chicken and fries....got to go there..when you are damn hungry and Caniac combo is my favorite........"}
{"text":"Loved this canes when I was living in Vegas! Service was kind of slow here and there but they never once messed up my order and always had friendly smiles on their faces."}
{"text":"Have come here a lot, consistent good food and service Everytime. Chicken is crispy, fries are my favorite part, and the toast is soft and buttery. It's seriously packed every night I come here. The patience definitely pays off though."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the number two. Three pieces of chicken, Canes special sauce and the piece of bread. The decor is wicked awesome with the 80's and old school movie posters. The place was clean and for first time tonight, the manager i would assume made sure everyone was ok. He was so helpful. I've been going to canes for six months and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I ate here all summer long when i lived down the street. The place is great.  Small menu makes it great because they specialize in chicken and only that. OH THE SAUCE is addicting. The funny thing is when i've gone through the drive through some of the employees will play around. So me and my own roommate played with. :)  The decor is oh entertainers of past with vegas flair and a cute pooch for what the name of the restaurant came from. Chicken. Bread and special sauce.  Infact the sauce alone.. Is so good. A little tangy, a little bb-q-ish. A little piece of heaven. So good that when canes comes to the work place everyone jumps on it. Well.. anything is better then employee food. But this is the holy grail. ANd if no chicken is left the sauce will go on anything, including the pb&j that is smashed in. :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Cane's in Gilbert often. Since I was in Mesa drove by it and decided to cruise thru the drive thru. This was the worst, greasy and gristly chicken I have eaten! It was 3 in the afternoon so I understand they are slower then but the chicken cold?? I have never bitten into chicken where the gristle was so tough I couldn't even bite through it?!  Thank goodness I only got a three piece, didn't even eat one, but the fries were good in the \"canes sauce\".  I have never been happier than this time to have that bread!  The chicken went into the big field near my house which I am sure rodents weren't picky about how icky it was!  VERY disappointed in this Cane's and would never repeat visit.  :( bummer....."}
{"text":"Based on the other reviews I am confused. Maybe it was a fluke or someting, but I am from California and I grew up in Texas, yet I've had better chicken strips at McDonalds. They were was bland and didn't have much favor at all.  The fries were ok but reminded me of cafeteria fries.  The dipping sause was really good, but everything else was just not that good. Plus, there was a large group of teenagers there being way loud and annoying."}
{"text":"This will definitely be on my list of post-vegas spots to go to before heading out of the city. I'm more of a chicken wing/buffalo wing kind of person but the chicken tenders here are really good! They're moist, not overly battered and paired with their sauce makes for a satisfying meal. The 3 finger combo comes with 3 chicken tenders, texas toast, fries and a drink all for under $7. The fries and toast were delicious sides, I'm surprised there were so many reviews that gave them negative notes...but my fries weren't soaked in grease but were crispy and my toast was top-knotch! I was stuffed after the meal, but if you have a hefty appetite you might want to opt for a larger combo. Overall, I'm a fan !!"}
{"text":"What's not to like? Fried chicken and fries and the best sauce I've ever had. This sauce is insanely good I don't even know how to describe it. Ugh. Just trust me on this and order extra for the 29 cents. My fries are never crispy enough but it's ok. This place is always busy and for a good reason! It's so good! Just when you're craving chicken fingers and fries like the little kid in you loves. Decent pricing and good portions for your money this is definitely a favorite and better than chick fil a."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place got such good rating. Came here for  a fast snack on my first day here in town because it was on afew hours before dinner. The chicken fingers taste nasty and they only had two sauces the cane sauce is basically Thousand Island dressing mix with something, it taste nasty, I forgot what other sauce they had but it wasn't ranch. I won't be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  these fingers have zero taste.  I do like the fries and texas toast.  one star for each."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying the restaurant. The chicken was okay.  The sauce was outstanding.  The service not so great.  I ordered two extra pieces of toast and when the girl gave me the order I saw only three boxes for the three meals I ordered.  I questioned the extra toast and she assured me it's in there.  Got home and no toast.  Also, they serve the best ice on earth (soft) so when I saw this,  I knew I needed an extra glass of just ice.  I go back to the girl and tell her I just want a glass of ice.  I've worked enough places to know the sometime they need to charge for the cup, so I tell her I know you have to charge me something and it's okay.  I didn't expect to have to pay for a soda ($1.87).  Anyway,  sadly will not be returning here for food."}
{"text":"We've always been greeted with a smile, our order has always been taken quickly and brought to our table quickly. The best what is the food of oh, the chicken fingers and cainiac sauce are amazing I would not hesitate to eat here, anytime day or night."}
{"text":"Saw a guy double park, come in the restaurant and fill up his chick-fil-a cup with soda and leave. 5 stars. Food and service were good, but entertainment was priceless."}
{"text":"One of the better fast food options. There is an obvious focus on customer service/interaction  and to the quality of the food they serve. The dining area is always clean and the drink counter isn't a sticky war-zone. I can dig this place."}
{"text":"Oh YUM.  Fantastic chicken strip shop!  Honey Mustard dressing is delish, Texas Toast is delish too!  The lemonade is wonderful!  Cane sauce just eh, fries are nothing new, cole slaw is bleh.  Who comes here for fries or cole slaw anyway, it's about the CHICKEN!  These strips surpass anything I've had before, they are wonderful."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to finally see a canes in summerlin where I grew up :) went for lunch today with some of my family and the employees are great. Very friendly and constantly checking if you're doing okay, need refills or any trash to be taken from your table. It is absolutely awesome. Simon took my order, he was very friendly. Brandon was running expo (he ran our food out to our table). Amazing people working for this location! Love it."}
{"text":"My 2nd time here. And I still think chick-fil-a is 100x better. This place has one item on the menu. Chicken fingers (and a sandwich i don't feel like trying). They only have their Cane's sauce (a tangy, chipotle mayo mix i didn't like) and Louisiana hot cause. The fries are the ruffled ones (too soggy) and the Texas toast isn't good at all (soggy as well and needs garlic or something to make it taste better). All in all the chicken is pretty solid. It's not great by any means - I'll pass going forward unless I am craving chicken and no nuggets / chick-fil-a is around."}
{"text":"I am a chicken lover, all types and varieties. I also have eaten more fast food in my life than is medically advisable. This is the zenith of both avenues. Raising Cane's has a chicken finger that is simple, yet executed flawlessly. The menu makes In N Out's menu look complex by comparison. It's simple: you want tasty chicken fingers fast? Here you go.   The breading on the chicken is thin and provides just enough flavor so that you enjoy it but the chicken is still the main emphasis.  The fries are also thin crispy crinkle cut masterpieces, a perfect complement.    The staff is also always excited for you to be a customer but not awkwardly over involved with you. The balance is actually quite well done: fast service with a strong attitude of making sure I am happy with the chicken.  Not how people don't rate this five stars, simple, fast, tasty. It's worth the trip every time.  Maybe the only negative people get cranky about is because it's so popular the drive through often wraps around the building....but you can already see why that would be a good thing right? If people are waiting in the drive through 10 minutes to get it clearly it's a high quality product."}
{"text":"I've been watching this Raising Cane's as it was being built and was glad to see it open.  I am a fan of Cane's and since it's close to home, I have another option for dinner.  I went inside and ordered the Box combo which is four chicken strips, some fries, cole slaw, a piece of Texas toast and a regular size drink.    After ordering, I was given a paper cup for my drink and there was some ice put in the cup before giving it to me.  I took a seat and I watched as almost every person dumped their ice into the grate on the Coke machine.  At one point, an employee brought a pitcher of hot water and melted the ice that had been dumped there.  The ice machine was working so I don't understand the need to give you a cup with some ice in it already.  In a brief time, my name was called out and I indicated where I was and the basket was brought to me.  The chicken tenders were cooked well and the chicken was very moist.  The fries are standard--nothing special.  The cole slaw is OK.  For me, they could leave off the Texas toast.  It's a thick slab of bread that's been buttered but it tastes like a big slab of partially frilled white bread.  All that being said, I am a fan.  The price point is good."}
{"text":"I LOVE it! First \"fast food\" type place that has quality Texas toast. I'm a chicken tender lover and a picky eater but I loved it here. Simple, good prices, great signature sauce, great hours, great staff. 5/5. :)"}
{"text":"I had a gift card for Cane's and I stopped here last weekend.  The place wasn't too busy.  We found a seat and I ordered 3 piece combos for the two of us.  The food was ready quickly and I waited at the counter rather than have the kid bring the plastic trays to the table.  During this time, I got the two iced teas we would have.  The food was very hot and it was good.  I'd been to Raining Cane's before and I knew what to expect.  I got a refill of my iced tea before we left.  My only complaint was they level of air conditioning.  Damn it was cold in there.    Cane's is a now and then kind of thing.  A drawback is it's very family friendly and the sometimes loud, howling youngsters detract from the meal."}
{"text":"Love the chicken, fries and sauce - yum!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food friendly help.  If u like tasty food at affordable prices this is a place to try"}
{"text":"Simply put, Cane's makes Chick-fil-A, Zaxby's and all of their other competitors look like total trash.  Let me tell you a story. It's kind of long.  Long before my wife and I moved to Vegas, we came from Chicago as tourists many times. On our very first visit, we stopped by the Atomic Testing Museum. Afterwards, looking for a cheap lunch that we couldn't get back home, we checked her original iPhone (before everyone had one) and looked up our nearby options.  We ended up at In-n-Out on Maryland, over by UNLV. It was horribly overrated. On the way over, though, we drove past Raising Cane's, and I exclaimed, \"A restaurant devoted only to chicken fingers! We HAVE to go there.\"  We didn't make it back until our next trip, and the meal I had then changed my life.  After that point, I had Cane's wherever I could find it - which was not often, since there weren't (and still aren't) any in or around Chicago. When we visited Minneapolis, we found the Cane's by the university closed on Memorial Day...so we drove to the suburbs for it. Afterwards, we bought a 32oz cup of the sauce and drove it back to Chicago. Every time we came back to Vegas, we'd have lunch here at least once - usually twice.  As you might imagine, when we moved here, we went nuts. We haven't gotten any fatter, but I did get a Caniac Club card and have racked up something like 40 visits in a year. There simply isn't any other fast food this fresh and this flavorful. When we want a cheap, delicious meal, there's only one option - box combo, double toast bbs, no slaw, extra sauce.  And that sauce is, indeed, boss. Totally fucking boss."}
{"text":"The food is great. It's always one of my top choices for a \"cheat meal\" However, what's even more great is their customer service skills. It was IMMACULATE and PHENOMENAL!  The white gentleman manager and the cute Asian girl cashier who worked on 10/10/15 around 4:45PM were amazing!!! They really helped me out today, and I would like to give a huge thank you. They deserve a raise.  They're customer service skills were genuine and rare to see nowadays, especially here in Las Vegas. Thanks again, guys :)"}
{"text":"I just moved down the street so its always a plus when I have A cane's right down the street!! The only thing was that the wait in the drive through was extra long.  Always have to get extra cane's sauce!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They make fresh sweet tea! Their secret sauce and chicken are a delightful combo. Only a marketing genius could come up with a witty, suggestive combo named '3 finger combo'. The only negative thing I could say would be that the disco ball was static. WTF, vibrant pop music playing and no spinning disco ball. I hope it's spinning glamorously my next visit."}
{"text":"One of the best  fast food joints  in Las Vegas. It beats most of its  competition hands-down. We had a six tender pack  combo the. Food was hot and very very well presented. For a fast food this is great value for money. Service is impeccable :-) faces by staff. It's a class act, way above McDonald's or KFC."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken! Friendly employees. Clean establishment. The food is always ready so quickly. This particular restaurant always has a lively feel to it. It might be because of its proximity to ASU and the abundance of college student patrons. The only minor gripe I have is that it can sometimes be a little hard to enter and exit the restaurant's parking lot due to the people rushing in and out of it. However, it isn't so bad to deter me from wanting to return."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! It reminds me of Zaxby's, which we have back in my home state of NC. In fact, it is virtually identical, but that is not a bad thing. The chicken is awesome and the sides (fries, cole slaw, and toasted bread) are good too. It's also not a bad price. We got 5 meals for about $36. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"By far my favorite canes!!! Everything is fresh and tastes made to order! But my favorite part of all is the customer service at this location. Not once have I had an order mess up or an employee be rude. They are nothing but sweet and complimenting to the great fingers!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure I dream about the Texas toast. They kind of have that In n Out vibe in that they only serve one thing, but they do it really really well. Service is fast and friendly. The chicken tenders are never dry. Portions are great. The prices are good, too- it costs me more to hit up Burger King for the same order, and obviously this place is much better than Burger King."}
{"text":"Had the sandwhich combo, which was amazing! The chicken is so crispy, just how I like it! The fries were nice and crispy and their special sauce is A1!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite chicken joint. The portion sizes are big, the chicken juicy, the sauce is adds just the right amount of flavor, and they give you a nice big piece of toast."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time when I visit Vegas I feel like this is a must. The people who work at canes are just great they welcome you and they cater to your needs and wants. The food is so good. They have some great sweet tea as well. I wish they'd open one up in Pasadena ca. That'll make my entire life better and I guarantee it'll make a large amount of money."}
{"text":"The chicken, fries, and toast are excellent! I would really recommend this place because they have a lot of GREAT food!"}
{"text":"The menu is simple, but the food is great. They didn't have straws when I went, how did they run out?"}
{"text":"Two words = crack sauce!  I love Raising Cane's and I don't even like Chicken tenders! Ha! Unless of course it's from Raising Cane's! Chicken is so fresh and you can totally taste it!  1 star = for all the cool combos, 3 finger, the box, and even one with 6 fingers. Can't go wrong with these options w/ different hunger dependencies.  2 stars = crack sauce. I don't know what's in it, but it's bomb! Not too tangy!  3 stars = Texas toast! What? Seriously so good. It doesn't even have to be super toasted, it's good warm and soft! Yum!  4 stars = Crinkle Fries. Shoots! All my fries are crispy. I can't be more happier than that! Love them!  5 stars = The story behind this place. Check it out: http://www.raisingcanes.com/our-story  Hands down, a Las Vegas staple for fast, fresh, and great tasting food!"}
{"text":"As a note, I've only been once, and I picked up our food through the drive-thru.  We had a bit of trouble speaking with the lady at the intercom, who kept verbally messing up our order, but that was a minor issue.  She confirmed everything, so it's not like our final order was actually incorrect.  We received our food in less than a minute.  The service was superb -- I glanced at some other reviews that mention workers goofing off and horrible wait times, but I saw none of that.  (This is not to say that this doesn't happen, only that I saw no evidence of it when I went.)  The cashier at the window was incredibly friendly, asking if we needed condiments or a tray for our drinks.  He even apologized for needing a signature because we paid by credit card.  The chicken was tender and moist and delicious, while the sauce was great.  The Texas toast was also very yummy.  The french fries and coleslaw were good -- nothing special, but they were tasty.    All in all, I had a great experience.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots while I was going to UNLV!  Neither good nor bad but always reliable.  I usually get the box, a gallon of lemonade, and if I could I would replace the coleslaw for another bread.    It's cool when I'm eating with my peers but sometimes an occasional indigent would come in and just sit there or wait outside and hassle.  Don't get me wrong but I like to help like the next person, just let me spend my money first then ask me for some on the way out."}
{"text":"Went to Cane's just to buy 4 chicken fingers not the combo, trying to cot down on the carbs. Went to the drive thru and paid on the first window. Got to the second window and got the fingers. Here's the messed up part, I asked for the sauce and they said it's 35 cents, told them shouldn't it come with the tenders they said \"no, it's separate\". Paid 70 cents for 2 sauces. Not that the cost bothers me it's just the principal of buying a product that goes with it.  Last time I'm going there Chic-fil-A right around the corner going there instead."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat too many fried foods (especially with a DOG as the mascot, makes you think exactly what is in the fingers) but this place is a most welcome exception.  I work close to this one, so I took the gf one day for lunch.  This place is busy!  Took us a bit to find parking and get in the long line.  This place serves only 4 things, chicken fingers, Texas Toast, fries, and cole slaw.  But oh...do they do it so well!  I usually get tired of seeing chicken fingers because EVERYWHERE you eat they seem to have it, and it's not that great.  But the smell here was enlightening, surprisingly fresh for stuff being fried.  I was in the food business...this is a sign that the oil they were using was FRESH.  Good start.  I ordered the Combo #1 - The Box Combo (their most popular one).  It came with 4 fingers, fries, cole slaw, Texas Toast, and a 22 oz. drink.  I pay, wait for our order to come, and get us some drinks.   I expect to see the same ol'...you know, Coke or Pepsi.  Pepsi equals yucky, so I'm a Coke fan (born in Georgia but raised in Maui, no joke).  But what do I see besides Coke products?  3 machines, 2 with Sweet Tea and one with regular iced tea.  Oh....my....God.....you're kidding?  Sweet Tea?  Are we in the South?  Lemme at it!  I love this stuff so I was curious to try their version.  Wow.  It was just right, enough sweet, enough tea.  Totally right!  Add some lemon and it would be heavenly.  I was already a fan and I hadn't even eaten yet.  I think I had like 4 glasses of Sweet Tea before our food arrived.  This stuff is sooooo good they sell it in one gallon jugs for 5 bucks each.  And people buy it.  We got our food and sat down.  I got ours to go just in case we were short on time.  I excitedly sat down and secretly hoped their food was as good as their drink.  I opened the box....and it was like angels singing!  It was like the gates of chicken finger heaven opened!  I didn't even put anything in my mouth, but the smell of the food was intoxicating.  Everything...so fresh!  My chicken fingers were perfect, not greasy....moist and crisp and hot with great flavor, not too salty or heavy.  Their 'secret' Cane Sauce, I have no clue what's in it exactly, but it compliments the chicken well.  I get a hint of ketchup and possibly relish.  Better than Ranch.  The crinkle cut fries were done just right too, crispy and not greasy.  The cole slaw went great as a side too, not too creamy but with a nice zip.  Their Texas Toast is bomb!  Garlicky, crunchy on top, and chewy in the middle.  All of it great washed down with Sweet Tea.    This ENTIRE experience only cost me....$13.  So worth it!  The service was speedy but friendly, understandable because the line was so long.  Place was very clean and colorful and bright, especially with all the movie posters.  Reminds me of a kind of modern diner (hmm...that's almost an oxymoron).  I go here quite a bit now, I just make sure that I do a few extra sets at the gym that day....heh heh.    Anyone reading this should go here (unless you're vegetarian....cause they don't make no tofu fingers) and give this place a try.  You will not regret it.  They only make a few things, but boy do they do it well.     Y'ALL GO DOWN THERE....YA HEAR!"}
{"text":"Still some good chicken fingers!  This Raising Cane's is about the same distance in the opposite direction as the one we usually go to from our house.  Funny enough, this one is right near an In-N-Out too!  Smart real estate I say, place yourself near an establishment that has a guaranteed customer base!  If you like burgers and fries, you might like fingers and fries as well!  This location is pretty consistent with any other Raising Cane's I've visited.  Same type of building, same type of décor, lots of red, lots of memorabilia, and lots of pics of dogs!  Although at the one we frequent more I do enjoy that Chuck Norris poster, always gives me a chuckle.  Come on, when Chuck Norris does a push up...he's actually pushing the earth down??  Yeah, very Zen!  Food, at least in my experience is consistent as well.  I usually stick with the Caniac Combo to share with the wifey - sub out coleslaw with an extra Texas Toast.  Six chicken fingers, large fries, toast, two Cane's Sauce, and a large drink?  Not much color for your diet, but damn near finger lickin' good!  The best way to enjoy Raising Cane's is dining in.  You can tell if you get the freshest food made in the freshest oil.  Fingers and fries will be crisp but not greasy, and the Texas Toast will have a nice crunchy crust.  Dip all this goodness in Cane's Sauce and hot sauce!  If you take Cane's to go you can sometimes get disappointed because the steam in your box can cause the fingers and fries to go soggy, and get your toast wet.  I've had it before to go and it's just not the same!  If possible do dine in!  Gotta love a place that serves Coca-Cola.  But even better, sweet tea!  Raising Cane's makes some decent non-alcoholic southern comfort in a cup.  I like to mix half sweet tea with half unsweet tea.  Not too sweet, and also saves on some empty calories.  Because when eating at Raising Cane's we all should be watching our figure!  Service was speedy and polite.  Our order was done and ready in about five minutes.  I'll be back as long as they keep up the quality of food, service, and of course the Coca-Cola!"}
{"text":"Whoda thunk...a restaurant that sells only chicken fingers?  Like that's gonna last??  Well, looks today like Raising Cane's is the Mickey D's of fast food fingers.  But they do a pretty good job at it.  Keepin' it simple and keepin' it good is one of Raising Cane's mantras.  Make it right, and they will come.  First time I came to a Raising Cane's was like 7 years ago.  It is still the place I come to now if I want a fresh meal of chicken fingers.  Thankfully, their product is fresh battered and fried in house, not frozen in a bag just needing a reheat.  Fresh = Good!    Dunno what it is about chicken fingers, they are like America's past time food now.  Kids clamor for chicken fingers!  Don't like fried chicken?  Have chicken fingers!  Need a quick party food?  Get some chicken fingers!  Like Ranch dressing?  Here, eat these chicken fingers!  It's somehow completely taken over the finger food world.  No, Raising Cane's isn't a fancy place (but they do have some cool memorabilia), and if you're looking for a juicy burger this ain't your joint.  But they do some damn fine chicken fingers, crinkle cut fries, cole slaw, and Texas toast.  And damn you Raising Cane's for your yummy sweet tea!  I could damn near drink a gallon of this stuff, feel my blood sugar rise, and drink another cup just for good measure.  You don't make it any easier with that ice you serve either, caviar for ice-eaters like me.    What is it with that damn Cane's sauce, huh?  The addictive, what I'm sure is crack-laced dip that I dunk everything in to?  I've been trying for years to distinguish with my taste buds exactly what is in that sauce of yours.  I get ketchup.  I get mayo.  I get some garlic.  I get black pepper.  Perhaps a hint of Worcestershire?  I've made it at home but I can never get that taste like yours.  What secret am I missing?  I could dip a rusty anchor in your damn Cane's sauce and it would probably taste delightful.  This location is almost always busy it seems, maybe because of placement.  It is after all by a major highway, and flanked with a plethora of different eateries all within walking distance from each other.  Like - In N' Out, On the Border, Panda Express, and across the street is Subway, Smashburger, and Café Rio.  I'm sure Raising Cane's benefits from all that foot traffic.  Service here is very quick, friendly, and sufficient.  Although I don't think I've ever seen an employee over the age of 25 unless you're the manager or assistant manager.  Lots of high school and college folk manning the registers.  Oh well, as long as y'all don't mess up my fingers and sweet tea I guess we'll be OK!  Oh yeah, one last tip - Stick with the chicken finger combos.  I dunno why some of you INSIST on the sandwich combo!  Sometimes I wish Raising Cane's would take that thing off the menu.  It doesn't work with lettuce!  But, if you absolutely need a chicken sandwich do the following:   1) Before you go to Raising Cane's, bring some sliced pickles in with you.  Look, go buy some and bring them in a Ziploc or something.  Just make sure they're good tasting pickles.  Don't cheap out!  2) Order The Box (if it's just you), The 3 Finger (if it's just mini-you), or The Caniac (if it's me) and sub your coleslaw (even though it's good) for an extra slice of Texas toast.  If you buy The 3 Finger combo you'll have to spring for buying an extra slice.    3)  Upon receiving your order and eating, take one slice of Texas Toast, slather with Cane's sauce.  Place hijacked pickles on sauce.  Top with 2-3 chicken fingers.  Put some hot sauce on fingers if you like spicy.  Take other slice of Texas toast, slather with more Cane's sauce.  Place slice on top of fingers.  4) Ta-Da!  Your own damn chicken sandwich!  Yes, simple.  But sooooooo good.  Trust me!"}
{"text":"I just slammed a box combo down in about 9 bites. This place is outstanding. Seems like their chicken fingers got alittle bigger? I'm gonna eat here every day for the rest of my life. Hopefully my kids will get to try this place."}
{"text":"Cane's is good fast eats that is easy on your wallet. This is usually one of the first stops that I make when I arrive in Las Vegas and it is sometimes is the last stop before I return to Cali as I like to order a jug or two of their sweet tea to take home. They have best chicken fingers, texas toast, and southern sweet tea EVER!  The only thing that I do not like at Cane's are the fries. I tend to order a la carte and get extra chicken and toast instead of the fries. When dining in I like to sit in booth between the superman and Jessica Alba posters! =)"}
{"text":"I think the review of this place is simple.  Just go and get some really good chicken fingers and don't bother getting the extras like the fries and texas toast, they are rather gross."}
{"text":"Here's what you need to know about this location: 1- its a zoo !  Always packed, parking lot is a safety hazard with the drive through line wrapping 360 degrees around the building. Park elsewhere!! Save yourself!!  2- its all about the chicken fingers. They are very good, tender with nice breading.  3- all the rest is...ok at best. Standard ho hum krinkle cut fries.  4- the Texas Toast is a NO GO! It simply has no flavor.  5- GRAB a seat when you walk in or else !  6- dinner for two us about 15.00  In the end.......just give me 4 fingers and a coke!"}
{"text":"For those that read my last review on Rio buffet knows that I was in Vegas last week.  So while driving around town in Vegas I've passed by and noticed a huge \"Cane's\" sign.  Not sure what that was so the moment I got back to the room, I've decided to look them up.  There I realized that it's not \"Cane's\", but Raising Cane's Chicken Finger Restaurant.  So being a curious foodie that I am... I had to make a point to check them out before I'm heading back to good ol LA.  My initial reaction... chicken finger restaurant?  What the?  I really got to go see it.  Upon my arrival (10:50am), There were like 3 people getting some food in front of me.  The location is right on Flamingo and near Maryland Pkwy which you can't miss, and it's super clean!  (Sorry for the sidetrack but I'll focus now!)  So the interior was squeaky clean to me!  Perhaps it was early in the day but it definitely smelled really good, super clean, very pleasant.  So now I'm approaching the counter.  The clerk was extremely courteous!  Very nice touch because I'm a sucker for service!  I told her that this is my first time here and that I'm from LA, and she gave me a good quick run down on the business history and what they offer...  I'm sure they were part of the procedure but nevertheless it's interesting to hear.  Very simply menu... it's pretty much 3 pcs of chicken with toast, fries, cole slaw and sauce, the 4 pcs version, or the Caniac (6 pcs version which was their large combo)  Having people in my party I had to get the 6 pcs with 2 sauces...  Here's how the food tasted...  Chicken finger was great!  Solid chicken pieces, freshly prepared, but to me it was slightly small that I would have liked for the price (which I'll get to in a minute).  Crinkle fries were pretty good... (I don't complain much about fries as they are my favorite, but I don't like steak fries too much because it's like eating an entire potato)  Cane sauce was decent, it was pretty much a hybrid of mayo based sauce mixed in with chili of some sort.. not too salty which is great with a little kick to it.  Texas toast was a thick piece of loaf with very little garlic butter on it, and the cole slaw was a cole slaw... nothing out of the ordinary and mediocre at it's best.  It also came with a drink though... (They got southern sweet tea which was pretty sweet!  LOL!)   The total of my meal came out be just under $9... it's little steep for me but the experience was very positive.  Again the chicken tender pieces could of been either bigger, or they could have substituted for more pieces considering that we are paying $9 bucks, but I have to say the quality of the chicken was very good and will definitely visit them again in the near future when I go back to Vegas.  So the history was about a guy writing a business plan on opening a chicken finger only restaurant, but was shot down by his professors, countless bankers, and eventually, worked hard a a day job and saved enough money so he can make his dream come true... Very inspiring if you ask me!  So maybe this review may not be as funny as others, but do remember that as long as you put your heart in doing what you love to do, work hard and not give up, you will eventually be rewarded!"}
{"text":"For fast-food, chicken fingers in particular, I love Raising Canes!  The chicken is always juicy-not greasy and the dipping sauce is super yum!!! The fries are crinkle-cut- pretty average but very handy to dip into the aforementioned yummy sauce!"}
{"text":"The billboard on the 15 Fwy plus EVERYONE saying they are addicted really hyped this place up for me. Yesterday I went for lunch. Its 9 miles from home so I was already thinking, This better be worth it! I ordered the 4 piece strip combo, with coleslaw, texas toast and fries and a medium drink. They boast giving military discounts, but after I showed ID and mentioned it, no discount on the receipt. Also I asked for extra sauce .29 cents. charge. The fries were crinkle cut, cafeteria style. Yuck. The coleslaw was ok, think KFC style. The strips were good, just strips....no seasoning or spicy or anything just crispy. They were good, juicy, meaty, but just...ehhhh. The bread was the BEST! Soooo good! My friend ordered the same thing. Got extra sauce for free, military discount and a large drink, no extra charge.......hmmm. Well, I'd go back if I was in the area, for strips and toast. :) For $8 bucks I was full but they need to make better fries, season the chicken and stick to their discounts!  Sorry but Wingstop wins.."}
{"text":"So glad I got introduced to this place.  It is perfect spot when I'm craving something quick and don't feel like splurging near the Vegas strip. I opted for their 3 finger combo (includes 3 strips chicken tenders, crinkled - cut fries, Texas toast, medium drink).  Their menu is very simple and consists of chicken fingers and chicken sandwiches, their selections are very similar to one another but just different sizes. Chicken strips was perfectly battered, not too salty, crispy, cooked just right, and you get them freshly made. It comes with their signature cane sauce and their Texas toast was warm, buttery, so good.  I wish they had a location closer to home then it would be my favorite fast food!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy! We love their chicken and get this about once a week for a decent dinner instead of traditional fast food."}
{"text":"Love canes! Always great service from this spot. Never had an issue with food or time it takes to get it.   Every one is super friendly too! A lot better than other spots"}
{"text":"We do not have a Cane's where we live, so we decided to try something new. Checked yelp and they had fantastic reviews. SO glad we did! The chicken is juicy, lightly breaded, and delicious. The fries are pretty good, the special sauce is pretty good, but the sweet tea is amazing! We are defiantly stopping by here again before we head home. The staff was also absolutely fantastic. They were super nice and helpful. Very pleased with our visit here. We both cleaned our plates :)"}
{"text":"6 years since my last visit here.  I can't really say anything different.   Restaurant is clean, food was just okay, and coleslaw was still watery and Cane's sauce is terrible."}
{"text":"Worst possible place you can eat at. The girl working the counter was rude. I went to get ketchup for my meal and their machine squirted it all over me and my light clothes. I told the girl and she laughed and said okay? There was no sympathy, no free meal which I expected considering my 70 dollar plus outfit was ruined. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Raising Caine's is a great place but this time was not the best. I ended up getting a Caniac. I went through drive-thru. This drive-thru ended up having me wait 7 minutes. I know it is fresh but the food was soggy. My fries were sitting for a while and they were not crunchy and they were cold. The chicken was soggy as well and was not hot. There was no crunch it seemed like the chicken was sitting for a long time. The toast was also really soggy as well it is usually my favorite part of the meal but this time was off. It was not my best experience at a Cane's. I wish that the service was consistent and the food quality was better. I am hesitant to go to Cane's again."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers were crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. The fries are top quality, too. Then why only three stars? The sauce! For me, chicken finger is all about the sauce. But their house sauce (the only kind of sauce offered, I think) is way too sweet and not even as spicy as regular ketchup!"}
{"text":"Have only been here a couple of times, but the food has been great each of them. Tenders are fresh and flavorful. Slaw is crisp. Of course that Cane's sauce is dynamite. Love their sweet tea and crushed ice. Giving them only 4 stars because of variety of the menu. Would be really great to see something fresh on there. Maybe a chicken finger salad over some fresh greens or at least a side salad to build your own."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service! Claudia took care of me and made sure that I got all my condiments. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"The sauce is the boss! Love the food. I always get the three finger combo. They do offer a military discount btw. The canes off of Craig road isn't that great. I usually drive out to hear when I need my fix."}
{"text":"The price is great!!! You get 3 different choices of a box to your appetite of how much food you want... The canes sauce is to die for its finger lickin good I can tell you that! The bread and chicken fingers go and accommodate very well to the canes sauce the fries are kind of just there for a filler but overall a great experience and the workers are so friendly and get the job done"}
{"text":"Everyone always raves about Raising Cane's, so naturally I had to go and give it a try. I'm generally very health conscious and not a fan of fried food and wouldn't go out of my way to eat it either. But we were close by and I really wanted to know what the deal was with this place.  The inside looks very nice. It is clean and has an appealing decor. The menu looked very simple, we ordered two of The Box, which comes with (I think) 4 fried chicken strips, cole slaw, fries, a buttery toast, and a special sauce.  The chicken was good, the meat inside actually looked and tasted like chicken. The sauce had interesting flavors. I really liked the cole slaw though, and the toast... I think totally unnecessary and just adds more carbs to the meal. They should offer some healthier options to that, maybe some apple slices or a side salad? The overall experience was very pleasant.  As I said, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go and eat there but I would definitely let friends peer pressure me in going :)"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is great when you're on a time crunch, but it could easily be greater with better sides.  The fries are so boring, and the coleslaw is a fucking nightmare.  So what keeps me coming back?  Their chicken tenders are always fresh.  I like their Cane's sauce and their Louisiana Hot Sauce packet even more.  Sometimes I get a little crazy and double dip my fingers in both sauce.  It's really wild.  Chicken Tenders are a dollar a piece, but i'll overlook the price since i know i'll be getting quality pieces."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place and give them 5 stars, but it was hard because I was a bit disappointed. I gave Cane's 4 stars for their service, cleaniness, and because they have the best fast food chicken tenders in Las Vegas.  Another reason for the 4 stars is because I can't find a Chick fil A around me. So, this place will have to do.   What I've Tried: -The Box:  4 Chicken Fingers, Texas Bread, and Fries:  Fries were dry and the chicken fingers were greasy.  Atleast the chicken fingers were real chicken breast cuts and cooked fresh.  The Texas Bread was actually the highlight.  -Chicken Sandwich:  Pretty good, but still with greasy chicken fingers.  This was basically the chicken fingers inside a bun.    -The Sauce:  Another highlight  Really wanted to love this place, especially since fellow yelpers and friends swear by them. All this place really did for me was crave Chick fil A even more.  Don't get me wrong, the chicken fingers were pretty good.  Just not good enough for me to give it 5 stars.   My other issue is their menu.  Not much more than just a Chicken Sandwich and Chicken Fingers.  At least Chick fil A offers wraps and breakfast. Maybe this place has a special menu like IN-N-Out.  I suggest they create a Texas Bread Chicken Sandwich.  Now that would be good."}
{"text":"You're insane if you don't think this place deserves 5 stars, service and food. INSANE!!!!  It's a must try if you're in Vegas. I took my aunt and uncle here when they came to visit and they were blown away as well. Outstanding each and every time I visit."}
{"text":"Went to this location, won't ever be back. Rude management, cashiers who don't know how to ring up someone or do the Mother's Day promotion... unless there is a card present... horrible... glad there is a Chik Fil A in town now."}
{"text":"A Vegas staple, just wish they didn't charge extra for Cane's sauce...seems a little \"nickel and dimey.\""}
{"text":"When I first pulled up, the drive through was packed! I decided to wait in the line and to my surprise it moved extremely fast! Staff was friendly, food was great !! The only thing I would recommend is to serve ranch as a dipping sauce too!!!"}
{"text":"I like Cane's. It is delicious and reasonably priced for the quality (fingers, lemonade, sauce, toast). The only bummer is that I have had multiple issues with order accuracy. Which is surprising considering the order is repeatedly read back. Today's example is a box combo which was ordered and read back as \"no slaw, no fries, extra, extra toast\". My boss brought the lunch into the office and it was no toast, no slaw, extra, extra fries. It isn't a huge deal that the order was very incorrect. It would be even less of a big deal if the order were correct. I probably wouldn't have wrote a review. Who likes reviewing fast food places? Since we're here though, here is some free feedback that I feel could benefit Raising Cane's. The fries suck and take me back to public school cafeterias. The slaw is mediocre and shouldn't be packaged in the same container as the hot fingers, fries, and toast. Styrofoam is less than mediocre and isn't great for hot food either. That is about it."}
{"text":"ElizaBeth and Heather were so friendly I had my small Yorky with me and they offered me a dog biscuit I thought that was awesome a lot of places frown on you when you have your service animal.   It was my first time here I don't normally do the whole deep-fried chicken but I'll be honest with you it was really good I will be back"}
{"text":"Yelp Challenge 2016. 17/116  One thing for sure, Canes sauce is off the hook. Would it be okay for me to lick those containers clean, because seriously I want to. No better yet just hook up an IV of that sauce and pump it into my body.  On the other side of the speaker in the drive thru was the most cheerful employee who busted out a Rhyme. She apologized for the wait as I was paying. Ummmm....5 minutes is not a long wait.   They offer two classic items here. Chicken Fingers and Chicken  sammies in a box with crinkle fries, cold slaw and some tastey Texas toast.  Sizes can fullfill any appetite. We ordered the 4 piece and the 6 piece box. They also sell fingers in large quantities. For chicken fingers these are pretty good. Lightly breaded and super moist. Crinkle fries were just okay. Kind of too soggy for me.  Between the two of us, we couldn't finish the food. Its okay, because we finished it later, cold and all.  Both meals came with a Coca-Cola product, lemonade or tea with the most perfect little ice cubes.  Located away from The Strip off Tropicana near Valley View in a shiny new building, with easy access to the 15 freeway. Plenty of parking. Easy drive thru experience.   I am a fan. A huge fan!!  #833"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken strips, great sauce...very reasonable"}
{"text":"Oh man this is the best chicken and fries you can get. I  cant wait till they make there way to California. when ever we are out of town this is our stop. deserves no less than 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"When I feel like blowing my low carb eating regimen I head to Raising Cane's, otherwise known as chicken carb city! It's worth every single carb and calorie to eat here. Their chicken fingers are cooked to order so you'll never get cold food or soggy fries. You can't go wrong with anything on the very simple menu. Your choices are chicken fingers, cole slaw, Texas toast and fries. Pro tip: when watching calories you can order the kid's meal for under $5 and get a tiny drink, a special prize, 2 fingers and a smaller portion of fries. That's my guilty pleasure and they've never given me grief when I order one for myself.   I grew up in the South and I think their freshly brewed iced tea is legit. They have sweetened and unsweetened varieties and both are excellent. Dine in and get all the free refills you can handle. Sometimes I'll swing by just for a large cup of tea.   This location is open very late and has a drive-thru. Kids seem to love it too. In fact, I've never met anybody who didn't love Raising Cane's. It's high quality food that's made fresh. I never mind the short wait after ordering because the food is being made just for me; it's heat lamp free.  Bonus points for the super duper friendly and enthusiastic staff, the spotlessly clean dining room, and the booth with a \"Wall-E\" poster on the wall (my favorite movie of all time). That's my special seat so keep it free for me guys, thanks!"}
{"text":"Has been fire every time I come. Haven't had a bad experience yet, which is hard for fast food places to achieve. Always have the best customer service! They come check to see if everything is okay with your order & are always super friendly. The food itself is amazing and always fresh. Get the sweet tea when you come!!"}
{"text":"Slowest Canes on the planet!!!! It's worth it to drive to a different location....you'll save time!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was decorated with a lot of different sports and entertainment memorabilia. The chicken strips were extremely tasty with just the right amount of batter. The Texas style bread was moist with a nice crunchy crust, their special sauce completed the meal. Overall the food was great and is definitely a great place for lunch or dinner on the go."}
{"text":"I always order extra crispy chicken when I come to this location , and I sometimes usually hear the employees complain in the back  saying \" really \" \" you serious \" um I'm sorry but that is your job ? Who cares if someone wants their chicken extra crispy? It's take a couple more minutes to cook the chicken extra crispy and satisfy the customer. Because why would you not want to take the extra five minutes to cook the chicken a little longer and give the customer an order they won't be satisfied with it. when it only takes five more minutes out of their time. And I do not mind waiting"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. This was my first time eating at canes. The chicken was very moist, but the batter has no flavor! Tasted so bland.... I'd rather have KFC. I did not really care for their \"famous sauce\" either. Was just so so, and even that couldn't hide the fact that the chicken is so bland! The fries did taste good, however.   I'll give it one more shot, maybe this location is still figuring it out since they're so new, but so far, I'm unimpressed..."}
{"text":"The tenders, the only choice of meat, were moist and not over seasoned or too salty. However, the menu was rather limited and we only ended up ordering 10 pieces a la carte. The sauces were NOT included and had to be ordered at $.29 each. We probably would've needed at least 2 each of the two flavors, honey mustard and bbq, but passed on them. The cost for just the 10 tenders including tax was $14. Not worth the cost or the wait in the snail pace drive thru. Other sides we could've ordered were coleslaw, which from the photos seemed like you'd get a paltry amount, and crinkle cut fat fries which seemed like the out-of-a-plastic-bag variety and not fresh cut. The combo items seemed overpriced for what you get and who wants breaded fried chicken on a bun? We stopped by just out of curiosity. Curiosity satisfied, appetites not."}
{"text":"Best chicken place by far! Amazing flavor and ginormous sizes. Their secret sauce is also amazing! First time here and can't wait to come back. Wish they had one closer to me. The place was packed, which also tells me they are popular to the masses not just me. Place was clean, friendly service, fast service and one table held all 6 of us."}
{"text":"I like the idea I like the simple menu been there several times the only downside is once in a while the chicken will be rubbery but that just depends on the chicken I guess"}
{"text":"What a brilliant concept! Chicken strips onDemand; I wish I had thought of it.   Tender, juicy, beautifully breaded chicken strips fried to perfection. Dip them in the oh so magical Cane's sauce and you'll have a life changing experience.  Crinkle cut fries and melt in the mouth garlic bread come on the side to make this delightful meal complete. It's a new favorite for Vegas.  Downfall: Coleslaw, no one likes coleslaw."}
{"text":"I've been to nearly all of the Cane's in the valley and this one is by far my favorite. I've always had great experiences in the store even when things were hectic. The managers takes time to be present and speak with many of the patrons. The store had been crowded with high school students occupying the dining room for a while, but the issue has been somewhat alleviated recently."}
{"text":"Definitely great chicken strips and fries. Great sauce.  Not much to say.  This place is always busy."}
{"text":"First time here.  Only complaint was the cashier asked if I wanted a fountain drink or lemonade.  I took the lemonade.  The cashier failed to tell us the lemonade wasn't part of the basket deal we'd ordered and charged us 30cents more.  The price certainly didn't break the bank but she led us to believe fountain drinks and lemonade were the same price.  There is no sign that states that either.  Then she tried to refund our entire meal and I wouldn't take it. I don't think she ever really understood what she had done was wrong. Good food tho."}
{"text":"Customer Service was above and beyond. Price has raised in the past few months, and that bums me out cause I actually like this place.  Charys, the manager on staff, always takes care of the customers with delight. Max, the gentleman who served me, was quick with our order and even humorous while expediting the process.  I'll keep coming here as long as they lower the prices!!!!!!! Seriously, they were high before... I'm heading to Chik Fil A until the prices drop"}
{"text":"Fried chicken is a hot topic in some circles... and I am voting to say that Raising Cane's has the best fried chicken strips!   The chicken is white meat, battered lightly and fried. It comes out hot and juicy.  I dip mine in their honey mustard, as I'm not a fan of their Cane's sauce.   There's a drive through if you are picking up to go home, but so you know, the chicken tastes better, fresher and crispier in the store.   If you sign up for their loyalty program, you can get a free combo."}
{"text":"I had never had problems with other locations but today I waited in line patiently and I ordered and guess what I repeatedly said KIDS combo and the lady was to start of rude I had my debit card and she did not want to take it until I showed an ID like seriously i bought here Tuesday and I paid and the lady did not ask for ID thankfully I had cash but imagine. Plus ruining my order how do you think caniac combo is kids combo seriously not coming here anymore plus my food was not warm."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is has taken Phoenix by Storm with its new locations.  They build from the ground up, so all their locations look the same and thus are brand new and super clean.  The food was fair, I was hoping for more of a Chik-fil-a style nugget or stripe, but instead got large strips that were pretty heavy with greasy fried coating.  The price was also high for a fast food value meal.   I would drive the extra few miles to hit up a Chik-fil-a vs. going to the Cane's that is closer to my house, but its worth a try just to check out this new chain the valley of the sun."}
{"text":"I went to Raising Canes for lunch.  Canes took over an old Burger King and spruced it up such it didn't look like an old Burger King.  That's a heck of a lot better than your basic 'berto's makeover.    The menu is limited; chicken strips, fries, coleslaw and Texas toast.   I had the 4-strip chicken box.  The chicken strips were freshly cooked and better than average, although I wish they had a bit more spice in the marinade or the breading.  The fries were crinkle cut, and were delivered warm and crispy.  The coleslaw was ... meh.  The Cane dipping sauce did enhance the taste of the chicken strips.  Overall the food was as good as what I would expect at a Church's or a KFC.  What was better the the competition was the look and cleanliness of the restaurant.  That is what I see as reason to go to Canes.  The table did not have the greasy fell you can have at other deep fry palaces.  I'll likely be back, but not for the food.  I'll be back for the item of the meal I have not discussed; the soda fountain ice.  The ice is finely crushed, almost to a slushy texture, which makes it great for sipping and chewing.  So rare to find top notch crushed ice these days, you know."}
{"text":"Great chicken tenders and the service is very friendly The lemonade was very good and the french fries are also really good"}
{"text":"This place was okay, but I can't understand why they only offer their cane's sauce or honey mustard. That really killed the experience for me. The chicken was good, fresh, but lacked seasoning and taste. A good cold buttermilk ranch sauce would have complemented the crispy chicken well. The fries were sub-par. A little soggy and very tasteless without adding salt or pepper. I tried their cane's sauce to make up for the lack of ranch and discovered it tasted like ketchup and ranch mixed together. I'd definitely recommend a different chicken establishment. Very over priced for the experience."}
{"text":"Very good fast food. Chicken fingers are generally a kids meal but Cane's makes it an adult feast. Very good Texas toast and delightful sweet tea."}
{"text":"All my friends and co-workers with the palate of a 5-year old swear by this place.   The chicken fingers aren't that bad and the crinkle cut fries are okay, but the food gets too cold too soon.  Not a fan of the cole slaw and I like that they let you substitute for another sauce or more fries."}
{"text":"My friends say Chicken Shack is better, and they're right. This is still pretty good though.  Raising Cane's is a chain featuring fried chicken and various accompanying sides. I've opted out of trying them for a long time despite their convenient locations all over town, but my co-worker ended up with an extra combo after using some sort of buy one get one free offer through their rewards program.  \"The Box\" ($7.19 regular price as best as I can tell via business photos) consists of four chicken tenders, a small order of crinkle-cut fries, a small side of coleslaw, a slice of \"Texas toast\" and a drink.  - The chicken is pretty good and has nice breading, and it's very reminiscent of what you'll find at arenas ir theme parks, perhaps slightly superior because it is purportedly made from chicken that's not frozen. However, they're not as plump and juicy as Chicken Shack's.  - The Cane's Sauce is a flavorful and creamy accompaniment, but the alternatives are scant if any; they simply lack the variety of Chicken Shack.  - The fries are good and taste best when fresh, but they are not anywhere near the spectacular shoestring fries of Chicken Shack.  - The \"Texas toast\" is a buttery piece of bread which is crisped to a golden brown. This and the creamy slaw are lovely and don't have  comparable counterparts in a standard combo order at Chicken Shack, but I don't really need more carbs than the fries, and I'm not desperately in need of slaw with this food.  I would definitely take advantage of special discounts at Raising Cane's or visit for convenience's sake, but they're not quite as enjoyable overall as my favorite local fast casual chicken tenders and fries."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers were awesome Howard really love the coleslaw. Bread was awesome.  french fries were served cold but they did get us a hot order.  It's a keeper for having some chicken fingers cuz they were really good.  I'd like to have a little bit of southern white gravy to go with them.  Take the girl out of the South but you can't take the south out of the girl.  Okay enjoy them"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is our favorite place for chicken fingers.   That pretty much all they make.  The cane sauce is awesome and we love the consistency no their food.  The Texas toast is our family favorite and we sometimes replace the Cole slaw and get double toast.  I like the slaw (so I get some kind of veggies!).  We also love Raising Cane's because they support our local law enforcement and that is important to us.  We love this place and you will too!!!"}
{"text":"Where the chicken is kick' n and the sauce is boss!! The kids love to come here! Chicken is always fresh and hot!  They make a killer Arnold Palmer!! This would be a 5 star but at the drive up window they kinda toss you your food out the window...the drive up like is always busy!!"}
{"text":"My favorite chicken strip place!  Fan of the sauce the sweet tea and the Texas Toast! yes yes and yes!"}
{"text":"When I first heard about this place, I was reluctant to try because chicken fingers are one of my favorite foods. However, I finally gave in and decided to check it out, and let me say, I have been eating here at least twice a week since. The chicken fingers and fries are great, but what really makes the experience amazing is the Cane's sauce. It is so good I almost want to dip everything I eat in it for the rest of my life. The sweet tea is consistently amazing, something I appreciate because places like Lucille's and Memphis BBQ struggle to keep their sweet tea consistent.  This place is definitely worth giving a try, and if you're a sauce person, ordering an extra side of Cane's sauce will probably be necessary."}
{"text":"LOVE this chicken and the sauce oh man this sauce I would put it on everything if I could this location is generally really fast inside but drive through is a bit of a pain in the ass t Her than that everything is great!"}
{"text":"Great food. The chicken tenders were crispy and the fries are always fresh. The Texas Toast is a must and their sweet teas and unsweetened teas are to die for. The staff are super friendly and efficient. The place gets busy around lunch time and the tables would get filled up. As soon as a table is open, an employee clears the table and wipes it down.   Recommended if you're looking for food fast and fills you up."}
{"text":"This place is amazing...everytime I come to vegas I make it a point to eat there for lunch at least once.  YUMO is the way I describe that Texas toast and chicken fingers...cant forget the sweet tea.  If you want to save some of that cash you bring to Vegas then this is the place to eat. ;-D"}
{"text":"Love this location :) food has always been good. Well... the other day my fries weren't 100% cooked they were soft and soggy. I have been to this location bunch of times and never had issues. Just bummed because I had to put my fries into the oven myself to cook them. I just got off work and was too tired to drive back. Why they got 4 stars... I'll just make sure they are cooked next time"}
{"text":"Ok, I came by around 10:30 pm in the  drive through, and had to wait till 11:00 pm for my order. Byes 30 minutes in the drive through.  Very poor service."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place till yesterday. And just found out we have one closer to my house! Anyway, loved the prices for what you get. It includes drink, fries and sandwich or chicken tenders. What a great deal! I was pretty impressed by the chicken, was delicious and the sauce they add one was yummy. I am not a fan of eating chicken at fast food too many food poising but this place was A+ I will be going back again! Oh try their tea!!! I fell I love with their tea."}
{"text":"Love the caniac combo! Substitute cole slaw for another texas toast :) Yum !"}
{"text":"We love Cains. Finally open near the house. The lines aren't too bad for just opening. Fresh and fast! Gotta try the tea...."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time since my fiance said it was awesome, to me it was so-so.... just another fried chicken joint nothing special to me"}
{"text":"It's good when it is hot....don't care for the coleslaw the lemonade isn't as great as they claim I think it's because it always tastes watered down."}
{"text":"Yummy chicken fingers bad customer service. The girl at the register tried to take our order without looking at us. When she asked for my name a second time I mentioned that it is also on the credit card in her hand. She replied that she never looks at the cards. Wow!"}
{"text":"This is gonna be short & sweet... The Positives: The chicken is great, which is good because that's what Cane's is known for. The sauce is pretty good too. And I do enjoy the \"toast\" (half of a New England style hotdog bun), when it's warm.  The Negatives: The fries are soggy, ergo under cooked.  The slaw is runny, and as another Yelper stated, bland as hell. And it seems to be the only available side other than the aforementioned soggy fries.  The fact that you have to pay extra for those sauce is ridiculous. I'm buying a meal, gimme some extra sauce for pity's sake, what does it cost? Pennies?   In short, go there for the chicken, that's it. Maybe the toast of you hit them in a good day...but pass on everything else."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is definitely a nice place to eat at. Good atmosphere and the chicken is nice and crispy. The texas toast is also very good. Eat here and thank me later!"}
{"text":"The food at Cane's is great!  The noise level is TERRIBLE !!  DO NOT GO ON A SUNDAY EVENING.....There is an 8 person group card game that has a few guys who are very loud (near yelling at people across the table from them).  Experienced this on two different occasions.  First time I did mention it to Mgr. as I was leaving.  I was told, yep they come in every Sunday night, I should have brought it to his attention earlier, he was in the Kitchen and was not aware of the level of noise and swearing.(For 20 minutes the mgr. was in the kitchen and did not come out into the dining area?)  Stopped in on April 29,2018, same group having their card party.  Mentioned to the mgr. about the noise level, I was told yep I have it in check.  I guess Cane's acceptable noise level in a dining area is a lot higher than I would expect.  Watching for about 15-20 mins while I ate it became apparent that the loudness comes from 1-2 of the people.  One of them left to the restroom and there was an immediate noticeable drop in noise in the dining area.   I guess the best way to deal with this is NOT GO ON SUNDAY OR NOT GO AT ALL!!!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at a Cane's. I have been having a craving for fried chicken. I read some reviews on Yelp and decided to give this place a try. I was not disappointed. I got the box? Chicken strips, coleslaw, Texas toast and crinkle fries. The chicken was moist and tasty, the coleslaw was perfect, the toast was great and the fries were hot and fresh. The sauce was also very good, I dipped my fries in it, and wiped up the toast in the last of the container. I will definitely be back! Service was also very good, went through the drive thru."}
{"text":"It was a quick stop for a midnight craving!  easy walk from our hotel.  Loved the disco ball they had node dining area.    The interior was very light, filled with others so also had that midnight craving.  And for a fast food restaurant, very clean...  Service was quick and friendly, and we walked away with a 6 piece chicken strip combo that had  fries, slaw, and a bisquit!   For all that craving I couldn't even finish the meal...  So much food!  Chicken strips were really good!  I've going to have to skip everything else next time, even the delish bisquit to be able to finish the strips!  Yes, chicken breast strips that were done soooo perfect amd still so tender inside.   Would definitely come back when I have midnight craving in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place serves some of the best fast food chicken fingers hands down. It's tender, moist, and you don't get that frozen food taste that you get from other fast food chains. We currently reside in San Diego and always look forward to coming here! AUURITE!"}
{"text":"Had never been until coming to Tempe. Overall, have to say the experience was just okay. This is because the price is too high for the taste and portion that you get. It's kind of like a slightly better Sonic meal with a higher price tag. Kudos to this place though because it seems that the drive thru line is always full, so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"I would love to see some side options happen here.  Like some mac n cheese, sweet corn or corn bread. Ya know? To be quite frank, the coleslaw sucks!  But other than that, the combination of fried chicken strips, Texas toast, fries, and Cane's sauce is a perfect and affordable lunch or dinner option.  The chicken is always hot and juicy. The Texas toast is a carb-o-holics new obsession.  I always switch between the 3 finger combo: 3 chicken fingers, fries, & texas toast  OR Box combo: 4 chicken fingers, texas toast, slaw, & fries Just all depending on how hungry I am."}
{"text":"YEAH, a Raising Cane's closer to me!  Exciting news!  Today was the grand opening for this location.  I have been counting down the days to the opening for about a month now.  I swung by today to check it out and I was pleasantly surprised.  The building itself is beautiful.  Well designed and makes the neighboring places look old in comparison.  The inside is the usual motif of all of the other Raising Cane's and looks great.  Now the important part!  The food!  I got The Box Combo and was happy as usual with my lovely lunch.  Everything tasted great and was up to the normal standards of the other Cane's I have visited.  Nothing super special, but exactly what you want when you go to Cane's.  The staff was also great as well.  Everyone was super happy and welcoming.  Everyone seemed to still be figuring out running the place, but they made up for it by being so pleasant to talk to and deal with.   On a side note, if you visit Raising Cane's regularly, sign up for their loyalty card.  They will send you lots of freebies and free Boxes through the year.  It's free, so you might as well save some moolah!"}
{"text":"Good junk food with awesome sweet tea.  The service is fast, the staff is friendly, and the food is always good."}
{"text":"I was out in the Midwest for a few weeks and one of the few places that I truly enjoyed was Raising Cane's.  We don't have these in California, so when I was out in Vegas for work, I got super excited when I saw a Raising Cane's!!!  The chicken is fresh, well seasoned, and crispy.  The ratio of chicken to batter is on point.  I also substitute the fries for the slaw, not because the fries are bad, but because the slaw here is amazing - it has the perfect amount of tang, sweetness, and freshness.  The Texas toast was also very good too - crispy and not too greasy.  This meal (with drink) cost under $7, which is the cheapest meal that I had out here in Vegas, yet was absolutely tasty.  I love Raising Cane's - def one of my favorite fast food choices."}
{"text":"First time at this Raising Cane's, all the employees are friendly and professional, I ordered the 3 piece meal which is a good portion. Denise who took care of my order was friendly and had a great smile the whole time she assisted me. My food was brought to me fairly quickly and it was hot and fresh. I will be coming back to this location when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Ok , my sis lives in California & I think canes is the only reason she comes and visits me !! Lol , the chicken here is the bomb , always fresh and cooked to order , not overly breaded and consistently juicy !! The fries are best when hot and salty ( eat them first !) , the coleslaw is pretty fresh , but for some reason doesn't taste good the next day ??? & I know I'm going to piss some people off , but the Texas toast is just ok and if on a diet not worth the calorie count/carbs !! And being that i'm a saucy type person , ( they never give you enough,& have to buy extras ) I recommend one sauce for every two tenders !! And pay a little extra for the lemonade it's worth it , and as my sister always does she takes a couple gallons home with her !!"}
{"text":"I just love Raising Cane's.  They may not have much to offer but what they do have they do right.  Their chicken fingers are insane.  The sauce is even better.  The cole slaw is a classic style creamy slaw.  The sweet tea is the best this side of the Mississppi.  The texas toast is light and fluffy with the perfect buttery toast marks.  You really can't go wrong.  I usally get a Box Combo which is four fingers, cole slaw, fries, toast and a drink.  It is just the right amount of food and an OK price.  Maybe a little much when you consider it is just simple finger food but still worth it once you taste everything.  As a little tip, try the sauce on the fries.  I think that is even better than the sauce on the fingers.  An interesting little note, Cane's is a strong supporter of the community.  As I understand it, each store has a charity they donate too.  Some times even an entire days profit.  That is pretty cool.  As if their food wasn't good enough they give you this reason to support them as they support so many others."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in how they are putting their sauce in smaller containers. I see what they're doing."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in how unprofessional the staff at this Raising Cane's location is. We went through the drive thru window and heard their whole conversation on how \"pissed off the last customer made them.\" exact words we heard from them at the window."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here just to get away from the strip a little bit. For off strip fast food the food is awesome and the prices are a welcome \"relief\" from \"on-strip\" pricing. If you make it here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So convenient for work. I have ordered food for potlucks and everything else. Their sauce is like crack  My only reason for 3 stars would be because every time i try their lemonade it taste different. Like i was craving it the other day and walked down there and it was so different. I was upset. Then when i get the 25 wings it doesn't come with anything else. Like $35 for some chicken that don't come with any sides. No drinks. Not even a piece of toast. I know y'all better than that    Customer service is great though. They're really nice and every time i walk in someone is cleaning so on a positive note I'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"Love the older guy with the mustache that works here. He has such a great work ethic and attitude and he will be cleaning the tables and scrubbing the floors while singing."}
{"text":"Found this place going from the strip to the mts.  Great chicken place. Chicken was fresh and crispy.  Everything tasted good and seamed reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I love the simplified menu.  You know your going to get great chicken every time.  The only draw back is that the restaurant is super noisy and super busy any time of day.  The drive thru is typically very long but they do a great job of getting the line moving fast.  I like how they have people walk through and pick up your tray after your done, it shows they care about the tidiness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time a couple months ago. Not as great as I thought it would be. At least on the day I went. Wasn't worth the hype.  Their sauce is pretty good though but that was about it.   And I'm pretty sure I made the mistake of switching out my Texas toast for coleslaw. Don't ask why I did it cause idk why either -_-   But anyways, yea, this place wasn't as great as I thought it would be."}
{"text":"I have to give credit to the company as a whole. They are consistent from every restaurant in every state, you can count on Canes to have an excellent meal. This place was just as good as the ones we eat in California"}
{"text":"This place is so bomb. Their chicken is nice and tender... I never knew ice teas could be comparable but man this place is unmatched!! You can buy their ice tea in jugs too.. Something I frequently do!!   Sometimes I come to Vegas just for canes. Seriously."}
{"text":"The sauce, toast, and chicken were awesome. I love how the strips were not long and thin but were thick and juicy. The fries reminded me of the fries you got in elementary school cooked by an oven... not great. The house sauce went really well with the chicken and fries though.   I want to go back again tonight but my gf is being wack."}
{"text":"This is the Newest Addition to the Raising Cane's Establishment! As other Yelpers have stated, It is located on Decatur and the 215. Across the street from LVAC, and Right Next to Winco Foods.  The Parking is Only a Few Stalls here, but you can Always Park in the Burger King, or Winco Parking Lots. There is a Drive Thru for your Convenience as well.   I had my 3 Fingers Deal to go, and it took Less than 5 Minutes for My Wait. Customer Service was Awesome, and if/should you have Any Questions, The Counter Girls will be More than Happy to Answer it for you, as I Witnessed today while Ordering My Food!   Be Expected that at times, It Will Get Busy....You Will Not Find a Seat inside, and the Drive Thru is Busy as well. Just Try to Be Patient..  =)  Their Sweet Tea is Awesome!!! Just had to say that....lol!  Happy Yelping!"}
{"text":"Hot chix!!!! Living in the south for a quater of a century I must admit, I was a little bumed leaving some of that style food behind. Moving back home to the west is awesome and then....wooHoo! Bonus Big Score! Raisin Canes....A bit of the deep south, right'cheer N da desert!!!! If you've never eaten southern fried yard bird, check'EM out! The sauce is Bombdigity!"}
{"text":"I just had this the first time a few weeks back. I really enjoy the sauce they provide with the chicken, kinda dumb you can't get ranch like who does that? It's a little pricey for chicken strips but overall it's good"}
{"text":"Chicken fingers are basically my favorite thing, so I have to praise these! Love the light breading, fries, toast, and the SAUCE! Not to mention it's fresh every single time you eat it. Bomb!"}
{"text":"Had another great experience last weekend with their exceptional customer service, quick service, and amazing food. I normally order the Sockeye Tail Gate for my practice a few times a month and never have a complaint.  Truly great non greasy chicken."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is a chicken tenders eatery.  They do nothing but tenders, served with fries, cold slaw and a texas toast.  They do the tenders perfectly.  This location is very crowded a lunch.  Hard to get a table and then you have to have someone clean it.  The drive thru is insane and parking is a problem.  I am handicapped.  I park in the handicapped spot, but all the cars at the drive thru block your way by being in the marked crosswalk to get into the building.  One word of caution, last time we were there I took a bite of my tender and burned my upper palate."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is a nice restaurant. They have Chicken, Fries, Toast, Salads, ETC. My personal favorite is the 3 finger meal. You should definitely go here sometime."}
{"text":"Dare I compare to Chick-Fil-A?!?  Raising Cane's is similar in deliciousness to Chick-Fil-A but they have garlic bread! You can make a garlic bread sandwich! I always get the 3 piece combo, along with their special sauce, and coleslaw - I'm in heaven. LOVE LOVE LOVE Cane's!"}
{"text":"I loves canes!! Delicious chicken fingers and fries!! Sweet tea is pretty good to!! When I've been craving it for the longest I get the Caniac combo and and extra toast!! I know hella fat but I don't eat this everyday so why not!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cane's before, it was ok...it was forgettable enough that, quite frankly, I've never been back.  And that! is the test.  (And then there's their lemonade.)  So last night, even though the line was around the block, I was hungry enough to wait, so I waited.  I got a \"Box Combo\", which was four chicken strips, crinkle cut fries, slaw, Texas Toast, and their own sauce.   The food was hot and delicious.  And unlike McDonald's, I didn't have to wait in two lines for the guys in front of me while MY FOOD gets cold. Spoke briefly with a very nice manager, re: speed of the line, she was great!    The chicken was hot.  Very hot.  Delicious.  1/4 strips was not as tender as I'd like, but do the math: that means 3/4 WERE tender.  And they were tender...and hot.  They were tender and HOT!  Fries actually could have been hotter; there were not as hot as the chicken (in their own way.)  The price of this Box Combo was, with tax, $8.00.  $8 bucks, on the head.  Attention Subway, McDonald's, et. al.: this is a better value.  Quite frankly, a MUCH better value.  Tell you the truth, if you took away the fries, @$8.00, is STILL a better value than MickeyD's or Subway.   Now, the lemonade.  The lemonade is so weak that to make it a \"signature item\" is just silly.  It's not that good.  It's actually not good at all, actually.  It barely tastes like lemonade.  Frozen concentrate lemonade from a grocery store tastes better and I'm not being sarcastic.  I've now had the lemonade from Cane's twice, at two different locations, so it's not the day, it's not batch, it's a mediocre recipe.  Wait.  That's too kind.  It's completely disappointing.  Here's the biggest test of all: would I go back?  Yes. I would go back to Canes anytime.  Good value, great product.  $8 bucks for what I got was a good value!"}
{"text":"The hubs and I decided to check this place out Friday night.   We loaded up the pup and headed off.   We always roll through drive thrus and go home to eat. The staff there was sooooo friendly! They even gave our dog a little doggy biscuit, how cool is that!   The meal itself was tasty. The breading is like a light crackery crisp yumminess going on. The sauce is great but wish there were other options. The coleslaw was tasty. Hubs went nuts over the bread but I wish it was toasted on both sides. The fries are nothing special, but ok.   We really liked this place a lot and will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"The staff here was stellar. We were greeted with smiles, and our food came out quickly. It was super hot, which is always great. Instead of the chicken tenders just being thrown into the basket of our Caniac, they were neatly displayed in a 'fan' style. Nice touch.   There was an employee in the lobby the entire time who cleaned as people left their tables. Nothing was left for very long at each table. The manager stopped by to make sure that everything was to our liking.   I have said it before, but I really appreciate that Raising Cane's wipes their tables down with paper towels to clean them. I really grosses me out to see employees using rags at other places. Who knows how long those have been in use. So thank you Cane's!"}
{"text":"Ok, this is not my favorite Cane's. Its actually my least favorite of the three that I have visited. That being said, it is the closest to my son. He lives on the east side, and it seems there are no locations on that side of town.  This location is close to UNLV, and therefore has mostly college students as patrons. Today was the worst experience here for us. the music was so loud that it caused everyone to yell to the person across from them. It was nearly impossible to hear my own family talking. The food here is always hot, but there is something off about this place. My guess is that the fryer grease is old. It just doesn't taste fresh. This was my last time coming here."}
{"text":"It was our first time at this location, and it did not disappoint. There were plenty of tables inside, and they were quickly cleaned once the customer left.   We split the Caniac, which is 6 chicken strips, fries, Texas Toast, Cole slaw and two Cane's sauces. It was excellent. As always, Cane's food come out steaming! The cole slaw was ice cold. Perfect.   I like that this store was clean, inside and outside in the parking lot. Always a pleasure."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. I've been to one other Cane's in Northern Colorado, and that one did not even compare.  This location was CLEAN. I was so impressed to see an employee cleaning after every table emptied, and the best thing about it...they cleaned using paper towels instead of a nasty rag that's been used over and over. Awesome!  We split the Caniac. Six tenders, fries, Cole slaw and garlic toast. Plenty for us. Everything was hot and tasted fresh. Some people do not like their Cane sauce, especially for fries, so it was nice that they provided two self serve pumps of ketchup.  Great experience."}
{"text":"I love Raising Cane's. This location is no exception when it comes to their food.   Hot, fresh and crispy. What I don't care for is the parking lot. You have to be cautious about the traffic coming in and going out onto the busy street in front of the restaurant. If you park on the east side, you still must cross in front of the drive thru to get to the front doors.   Other than that, they have service with a smile, and good food. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Most Disgusting thing ever!!!! I got my food and drove home. Once I opened the box everything looked normal and I was about to make a sandwich with Texas toast and chicken and then when I picked up a piece there was a BLACK PUBIC HAIR!!! It was GROSS AND DIDN'T WANT TO DRIVE THE WAY BACK THERE!  This happened around 545-6 pm on Sunday August 28 2016 so you can talk to your damn employees to be more hygienic!!!!!! Never going back to raising canes ever!  If I could give it a 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"1 Star for the mixed up order, slow service and poor customer service received here.  Wanted to try this place out, and ordered the 4 strips in the store to go. I waited a few minutes and noticed that they served about 6 cars in the drive thru before asking where my order was. The guy told me it would be right out, then the next orders that came out were for others that ordered way after I did. I went up there again to see what the problem was, and the female drive thru person with the dirty black sweater, glasses and a headset said my order would be out in 4 seconds. I said yeah right, 4 seconds are up and it came out close to another 4 minutes later. I basically wasted 15 minutes of my life in this hell hole. The food wasn't all that either, more like Raising cr@p to me..."}
{"text":"This place is BOMB! The Texas toast is everything and the chicken is so juicy! The Coleslaw is okay, nothing to rave about. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place is good and usually fast but for some reason tonight this place is so slow and there r not many people inside or even in line drive-thru"}
{"text":"5 stars for Fast Food is different than dining establishments.  5 stars for awesome Chicken fingers.  The caniac is what I always get."}
{"text":"I used to eat at canes roughly every other day whether it be at this location or the one on Craig rd but it all stops today. This evening I walked in and approached the counter to start my order when I was asked, \"are you by any chance a cop\" I replied no as I am not and was told I would not be served and needed to put my sidearm in the car and come back. I come here very often and always have my gun on me. Well I ride a motorcycle and that was not an option so after getting very frustrated he proceeded to ask if I would like a meal to go which again, HOW!!! Canes was one of my favorite restaurants until now. I refuse to go back to Canes. The fact that people die everyday fighting for our lives and freedoms so I can have my second amendment and you refuse to serve me because of that? This company is a non-gunfriendly place and I will make sure to let all gun owners know that you are not welcome here."}
{"text":"Pretty good chicken strips! Nice staff and very clean inside! The cane's sauce (Awesome) and the honey mustard are the only two sauces they have. The fries and texas toast are bomb!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today and it was good. I had strips and fries. The dippng sauce was pretty good also. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Awesome excellent & clean. The staff is friendly, the restrooms are clean.  I ordered the chicken strips & fries with the coleslaw.  The dipping sauce is the best for dipping your chicken in...  and I see a location has launched up in Downey Ca.  I will be visiting that location as well. ?"}
{"text":"Never ceases to satisfy me!  I love this place! Every time I'm in town I make sure to stop by.   THE CANIAC COMBO: 6 Fingers, fries, coleslaw, and bread -STARS: 5/5  SWEET ICED TEA: The name really says it all and it is amaze balls (really the ice is actually small ball shapes). -STARS: 5/5  This place is heaven!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE Cane's!!!  The Sweet tea makes this southern girl heart sing with joy!  The chicken fingers are always amazing!!  Cooked fresh so they are hot and never greasy.  The Texas toast is yummy!!!  The Cane's Sauce.....I could bath in it!  The staff is usually friendly.  I have only had two staff members I wanted to advise to give up a career in Customer Service.  The dining area is always clean and I love how they walk around and clean tables and ask how the food was.  I CRAVE this place!!  In fact I am so gonna beg my hubby to take me tomorrow!"}
{"text":"The chicken fingers are good and juicy but they're not the best I've ever tasted. I wasn't that impressed by the dipping sauce or the fries, but I loved the Texas toast."}
{"text":"As a lot of the previous reviews states although the chicken is good, the sauce is the big selling point. That being said, I was above and beyond disappointed to go in today and come to find that the sauces were downsized to almost half of the amount they used to serve. If you are going to have an added charge for an additional sauce then it should be an amount of that value. The food has always been great but I feel as though they are starting to care about saving the extra buck than providing the quality meal a customer deserves."}
{"text":"So good even though it's fried chicken. The pieces are very tender with a light batter coating. Good portion sizes with fast service"}
{"text":"I never thought a restaurant that only serve chicken tenders could be so good but they are I wish they had one on the West Coast"}
{"text":"My husband and I are not typically fast food goers, however Kane's sounded really good this particular evening. We decided to dine in and we never expected that their customer service would be as exceptional as it was. We were immediately greeted, everyone seemed to have a smile on their, and by the time we ordered the young lady upfront (with the good makeup) already knew what we wanted because she overheard my husband and I discussing what we wanted. Our food came out faster than we could sit down and it was delivered straight to our table. We were acknowledged by many employees who made sure we had everything  we needed. The assistant (to the) regional manager came to our table to make sure we were doing ok. We were curios about the fish and hard hat and he was happy to tell us the backstory to raising Kane's. He was a very nice guy! Overall we were very very pleased with our visit. Also the food was amazing! The toast is the most!"}
{"text":"If you are tired of KFC, Popeyes or Church Chicken and you are heading to Vegas. Go check it out and you might have the same feeling i do everything taste better when it's fresh."}
{"text":"Chicken is always good and the sauce is the bomb!!! Prices are good!!  They have booths which we like because they are more private when you have children.  The only thing I would change are the French fries but it's not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here. Food was good and I don't even like to eat fried foods. Service was amazing."}
{"text":"Amazingly fast service! Deliciously unhealthy food.   I can't recommend this location enough."}
{"text":"A mis hijas les encanta a mi esposo también siempre terminamos comiendo en Canes !!!!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Raising Canes. I've visited three locations in the Vegas area and each location has deliver on delicious food and great customer service.   Whenever I visit this location I like to go inside. I personally do not like the drive through because it is weird but I prefer going in and ordering to check out the decor. I like that there is a disco ball at the entrance and it makes it looks like their is always a party going on. This location is very clean and my food has always been hot and fresh. I usually visit this location after I have been out in Summerlin shopping and need a quick refill while I travel home.   I usually order the box combo but on today's visit I ordered a children's combo. The children combo helps hold me over until dinner and it comes with two large chicken strips, fries, and your choice of a apple juice or fountain drink.   I love the crispiness of the chicken strips, their sauce and their always hot fries."}
{"text":"Raising Canes reminded of Zaxby's. I think this place is a really great fast food eatery for a quick and yummy meal.  My favorite is their special sauce that comes with the chicken tenders & the Texas toast. Also, if you ever order a meal with coleslaw, you can substitute it for another Texas toast. Yum!  If you eat the chicken tenders without the special sauce, then the chicken is pretty bland. I like to order my food to go and when I get home I add some seasoning to my fries.  I can always count on my food being hot fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"My first time here and I will be back. My favorite is their canes sauce and it compliments the chicken strips perfectly.  I also tried their lemonade and it was a bit more bitter for my taste, but it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"The food here speaks for itself- it's awesome and cheap! What can be better? Well, the staff has always been precise. They don't get personable, but they do their job and make sure you get your food fast. That's a huge plus in my opinion! This place is always crazy busy, yet I get my food in less than 3 minutes every time. It's kind of funny cause they have weird decor in the restaurant (i.e. a superbad poster). I want to know why... Anyways, the only negative I have is that their soda machine is never quite right with the taste. It either lacks sweetness or it lacks carbonation. Please fix it and this place would be 5 star perfect!"}
{"text":"I would give negative stars if I could! I came in with a coupon that required a raising cane card-which I had, but the card hadn't been registered long enough and they wouldn't honor the coupon. That alone wouldn't have upset me enough to write a negative review but the staff were ridiculously rude and unapologetic. The manager-Paul was asked to help and he was so unhelpful and mean about being bothered to help me. I had waited already a half an hour for my food and I was so frustrated and disappointed in a place that in the past I had really enjoyed eating at."}
{"text":"The chicken is very bland tasting and they serve it at 1000 degrees. The fries are frozen crinkle fries, the coleslaw is mediocre and their house made lemonade is way too sweet. The best thing I had was the $0.59 side of bread."}
{"text":"Good food, but I think its a bit over-priced, hence 4 not 5 stars. The box combo with chicken fingers, fries, texas toast, and slaw is the popular way to go. The food has always been fresh, and the staff is over the top happy. It almost freaks me out a little bit that every single staff member smiles so much. I would assume it's because the working conditions are great and not that they are robots (literally).  I have officially made the switch over from McDonalds nuggets to Raising Canes, which almost pains me to say considering those Micky D nuggs are part of my youth!  Overall, I highly recommend for a lazy, redbox sorta night."}
{"text":"I have heard many positive things about this place so I finally had to go try it. I went with a coworker. I got the three finger combo. It came with three tenders, fries, Texas toast, and a drink. For the price, this is a great deal! The chicken and fries weren't greasy! That's really important. This location is sort of difficult to get to. There's plenty of seating and the girl that helped us was new, but very friendly. If I'm ever in the area again, I will be coming back."}
{"text":"I eat here often for lunch since I work nearby. I like that it's always cold inside after escaping the Las Vegas summer heat. The food is good, the chicken could use more flavour but that's what the 'secret' sauce is for. 9/10 times the fries are good. Sometimes they aren't salted enough and taste like straight potato. But there are salt packets so it's not big deal. And in my opinion the price is very fair. For a little more than $7 you can get the Box Combo. I'd recommend subbing the coleslaw out (which is decent) for a second texas toast or more fries, extra finger, etc...  They are constantly cleaning the restaurant which I like very much since I am a clean freak, even though my room looks like a pigsty. The tables are usually cleaned within minutes after the previous customer has left, and they are constantly sweeping the floors and wiping the windows. My only gripe is sometimes the booth seats are forgotten and will sometimes have food on them.   It does get very crowded on the weekend, but that is to be expected since it is near the outlet mall and Town Square."}
{"text":"Coming from California to Vegas and finding a good chicken spot besides kfc , this place is AMAZING. I always drive past this place on my way to work and never really thought twice about it because I didn't recognize the name but today my mom and i , after having a terrible experience the previous night at kfc decided to try it . Boy this place did not disappoint. Great prices for bomb chicken. The chicken isn't greasy it's good quality meat. Everything was made fresh from the chicken and fries to the Texas toast  the staff is friendly and u can tell they love their job. Very fast in getting my food. Good atmosphere. Best quality chicken I've had. Will definitely be coming back! #bomb.com"}
{"text":"BOOM! I don't care that my gf says that this place is overrated. I just don't agree. I love the chicken strips at this place. Full of flavor and huge. The TX Toast is awesome. Also you can ask for no coleslaw and extra fries. The Caine's Sauce is also awesome, you only get one cup and I think it's extra for more, that's maybe my only little issue.  I am not a  big sweet tea fan  but this place being originally from the South, they do have great tea. I usually get the unsweetened. I can't say I am a huge fan of food chains but this place is always on the money, any place I have ever had it. The Golden Standard of chicken strips!"}
{"text":"This place is good. The chicken is crispy and juicy. I like the dipping sauce. Even the long drive thru lines tend to go fast most of the time. When they were new I had a problem with an order and the manager more than made up for it. I go here once a week and haven't regretted it yet. I wouldn't mind if they had some mac and cheese, though. It's always fries, slaw, toast."}
{"text":"Its ok theres alot of crack heads coming in AND OUT I GUESS THATS VEGAS DONT NO ? Im from california. Food is great if u ask me it tasted like churches chicken"}
{"text":"This Cane's is always rude to us when we come at night. My last experience here we tried to make sure they got our order right and then barked at us and interrupted us and sent us on our way before we could make sure it was right. Always in a rush to get us out. I work in food service and completely understand that mentality but benign awfully rude is not the way to go about it. The good food does not make up for the way they treat us or get our orders wrong."}
{"text":"Wifey and I got off work and we're starving so we decided to get In-N-Out originally, but saw the long line so decided to go to Canes instead which had no line. Makes sense as to why no one was there ...  Upon getting my order my Dr. Pepper was flat, so I exchanged it for a Coke instead. Same deal. Flat.   When I got home to eat my food, the fries were gross. Tasted old. The girl at Canes said they ran out of lettuce, so I would be without lettuce on my Sandwich combo which was fine, but now the whole meal was off. Then, the Canes sauce on the sandwich was very little and the bread was gross.   I'm no stranger to Canes. I typically love their food, but last nights visit made me rethink. Totally disappointed and should've waited in that long line for In - N - Out. Step up your game, Canes. Be consistent with your food and train the employees to be better when a customer returns a drink. No apology was given either."}
{"text":"Context: Went here this past weekend for something quick, fried, and filling! Went with a couple of friends and we were out the door in no time (in a good way of course)  Food: Chicken strips are what they're know for, but I guess it wasn't as crispy as I'd like it to be! The batter felt a little soft for my liking but they do use real chicken. The sauce is to die for, a spicy chipotle type of feel! The fries are delicious, and it comes a nice toast of burnt cheese bread and sweet tea. No complaints here.  Price: I paid less than I believe $7 for my meal, such a steal!  Environment: A fast food feel like environment  Service: Friendly and patient cashiers and workers! They're always smiling! Also super quick too!  Check this place out! Good for quick and fast eats that's tasty and a great price too"}
{"text":"This one's alway's usually pretty busy (especially the drive-thru lane) but on Super Bowl sunday, it wasn't crowded, which was nice for us. Lunch was not loud either. (The  maryland/ flamingo one is the busiest, fyi). But after a little while, we were just about done, little by little, more customers walked inside.  This is my favorite place to get chicken fingers, because the tender chicken is not heavily breaded- cooked perfectly, seasoned just right, the coleslaw is yummy, and our picky-eater son never has an issue eating the food (*his fave meal is chicken & ranch*). We (hubby, our son, & I) usually split the caniac combo (fingers, fries, texas toast slice & coleslaw), and add a couple of extra fingers. Oh and the sauce is yummy, too.   Clean tables, good service, the manager made his rounds checking on the customers, yummy food, it's what keeps us coming back for more."}
{"text":"We were curious and wondered what the fuss was, with this chicken finger restaurant. In my twenties, I loved chicken fingers. Now I have them on occasion. Since we heard about it from my Mother-In-Law, we knew that this place does not serve ranch dressing with the fingers- it's not uncommon in the South- they probably think that we're weird for ordering ranch for our fingers & fries.   We came here on a sunday for lunch. The menu, though simple, had different combinations to choose from- and there is a drive-thru window for those of you who just want to take it home. Surprisingly, the chicken fingers were very good. The breading was just enough- I hate when restaurants use so much breading in their food. The seasoning was very good. The red sauce (signature) was good too.  Very generous with the fries- I didn't eat all of it and threw the rest away. My husband likes the Texas Toast. Little by little, people started coming in who had just come from church- and it did fill up by the time we were done with our meals. I am mentioning this if you do not want to be in the middle of a large crowd and try to find an open table (drive-thru window). Free refills on drinks. Tip: Mix half the sweet tea with the regular unsweeted tea to make the right mix of Iced Tea."}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars.  I was really wanting chicken fingers (hadn't had them in a long time). But I didn't want heavily breaded ones (I hate that). Enter Raising Cane's. Since we were going to Target, the Dollar Tree, and K & K, we went here.   It was packed inside- should've known, the parking lot was full. Man, was it super loud. Our little one had just fallen asleep. Not for long! The music is pretty loud to begin with. There is a very loud yell for your name to pick up your food- even the girl next to him was like \"Dang!\" One of the few booths available were right up front, so we were stuck there. The remaining seats were stools in front of the window, opposite the cashier counter. So, the crowd, music, and the shout-out for your name made this a loud environment. Note to self: only bring the baby when he is awake.   The food came out fast. Free Refills on soda. I love that the fingers are not full of breading. The sauce is really good (kinda like ranch mixed with thousand island dressing). I don't normally like cafeteria style french fries, but the crispy ones were tasty. Pump-style ketchup (like Wendy's and Arby's) at the counter next to the soda fountain. I must've been hungry (or anticipating, or BOTH) because I ate most of (OK, almost all of it- you caught me) my 3 finger combo meal- three fingers, sauce, texas toast, fries and drink. My husband got the Box lunch combo- mine plus another finger and coleslaw.   Clean place. The clerk was going around collecting customers' garbage. Drive-Thru window. Tailgate Packages available- perfect for large parties and events."}
{"text":"I love the food. If you ate here every day you would be dead of heart disease by 40. So I make it a once in a while treat. I think you should skip this location. It is always super busy. It feels like they can't keep up with the crowd. You are easily the 12 th car in the drive thru. Today I went inside. They had one person taking orders despite a long line. When I finally did get my food everything on the plate was luke warm at best. The bread was ice cold. The chicken looked heat lamp burned. I NEVER take stuff back but I did this time because it just didn't look good. So I took it back. They made me another and were pretty cool with it. But finding a table was hard because they were all dirty. I worry this is what places will all be like as costs of operating keep rising. The people working looked like they were working hard. I didn't see any body just sitting around. I wonder if staffing is an issue. I will do other locations but I am done with this one."}
{"text":"I attempt to be very conservative with 5 star and 1 star ratings, but I really can't think of anything I dislike when it comes to Cane's. The chicken isn't too greasy.  It has the perfect amount of breading. The texas toast is delicious.  Ask for \"double buttered\" for them to butter both sides. The fries are good.  Not crispy, but not limp either.  Its cooked perfectly. What it really comes down to is the sauce.  Its like thousand island but its got a kick to it.  I usually substitute my slaw for extra sauce when I get the combo so I have plenty for my chicken as well as for my fries."}
{"text":"Super busy Saturday night due to the ASU sun devils game.  Even tho it was rowdy and packed with people we had no trouble finding a quiet corner to enjoy our meal.  It was our first time at this joint and it seemed pleasant.  Staff was very polite, kept the place clean, fully stocked, and got our orders out quick and correct.   Food was delicious and filling! Love their texas toast and fries!"}
{"text":"Who would've thought that a fast food place that \"specializes\" in chicken tenders would be such a hit? Well, Cane's did!   I'd say that it's a place that is comparable, if you've ever had it, to Chik-fil-a. The tenders are so full of flavor from the breading to the meat itself. I don't know what they call their sauce but it's not bad, pretty peppery, I like it.   It was pretty cute how they decked out the place for Halloween. Service was good, they were pretty nice here."}
{"text":"The best chicken tenders ever!!! Don't forget to ask for the special sauce! You could tell that the chicken is not frozen; its fresh... How I miss that place.  Their toast is good too."}
{"text":"I got the chicken strips and fries. I love me some crunchy chicken strips. I only remember that the sauce was good, but the chicken strips were not notably special. It was just a regular chicken strip with not a great breading or crunch.   Moving on to other chicken strips..."}
{"text":"I still am not quite grasping what's so amazing about Raising Cane's. I give a solid 2.5 stars.   Their chicken tenders are meh. Breaking seasoning is meh. And even their dipping sauces are alright. I don't care for their house original sauce, but enjoyed the honey mustard.   The kids menu is a good deal, and enough food for one belly."}
{"text":"this location is easily accessible and near the freeway. it always is full butworth the wait. i was surprised when they ipen that they could accommodate a big  order of a party plate and itcwas quick. there food is always good- chicken fingers and toast are my fave!!!!if you have your dog with you when you drive through they give a dog treat."}
{"text":"The food was fresh, the place was clean, a great place for lunch or a snack."}
{"text":"best chicken tenders in Las Vegas. Good service good food good people. If you drive through with your best friend in the car they'll even give you a biscuit."}
{"text":"Double the toast, minus the slaw. You can't go wrong with Cane's. Their sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"I go to this one all the time and last night I went in and service was awful, they're usually friendly but this time they were rude and took a long time. Gave attitude, not going to this location now, left a bad image for me"}
{"text":"We've all rolled into Canes at 1:30AM after a party tryna get some chicken, the only thing w canes it's always super cold in there and the chicken always super hot. Anyway butter your toast on both sides, it'll change ya life"}
{"text":"For Chicken tenders this is your spot. It's not going to break your wallet , but it will fulfill your hunger. The quality of the food is great, tenders are always juicy and tender, you combine the tender with the Cains sauce, but don't forget the Toast it's a Mona Lisa in the chicken tender world. I'm telling you you will not be disappointed. If you are really \"Hangry\" get the canica combo, 6 tenders with fries , toast and cole slaw oh and your large drink. I'd suggest the Sweet tea."}
{"text":"Clean feeling from the moment you walk in. Fast and friendly service with plenty of attentive staff working to keep your tables clean and your order delivered fast and fresh. And I'm pretty sure their secret sauce is laced with an illegal substance. Great food and service, will return."}
{"text":"This place is great to be just a chicken joint. The texas bread is spectacular! My kids loved it here and was so excited when our \"waiter\" Jasmin brung out our food. The people here are really nice. And they always have fresh chicken when i come!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh. Line is long pretty much all the time. Fast food without tasting like fast food so that's kinda magical."}
{"text":"I was going to give three stars because its  chicken fingers and French fries.  I decided this place deserves only two stars because they have only four items in the menu -oh, five if you count the kids meal.  Chicken fingers -quality.  Two thumbs up. French fries -okay, but not great. Cole slaw -no clue cuz I gave mine to hubby. Texas toast - short and thick white bread that's been toasted or grilled and it is white bread good.  The special sauce that even they can't describe. I would have preferred Ranch dressing, or Devils Spit BBQ sauce, or blue cheese dressing, or mustard or Catsup. It just wasn't very good.  I did feel it was nondescript.  It's all okay but not good enough to bring me back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This location gives the smallest chicken fingers. Compared to the others.. go to another location if you want your moneys worth. My family and I go to canes 2 to 3 times a month and we live near in the middle of this spot and the one on Charleston and Decatur.  Dont know if theyre trying to penny pinch because they just built this location from ground up..but definitely small compared to the.other locations.."}
{"text":"The majority of reviews are quite correct. Great fast food with friendly staff. Ordered the \"box\" and wasn't dissapointed. Watching the other guests, everyone was enjoying the food, and all finished the entire serving, either a  clue that it was good, or a comment on our \"growing\" american obesity. Or both."}
{"text":"Being somewhat new to town, I always heard the whispers of how Cane's is the best chicken place in town, etc etc. I don't know why, but I always imagined it as this hole in the wall chicken joint that just put out amazing food. Man was I surprised when I pulled up into this location for the first time.  This is a modern, clean, good looking fast food chain. It looked brand new, and things were well maintained. However, what REALLY surprised me were the staff. The person that took my order was awesome, she called me by name multiple times, anticipated what I needed, even pre filled my fountain soda cup with ice. I mean really?! Putting some ice in so I don't have to?! That's service.  Now down to the food...it was delicious. I had only ever had their chicken before after it was cold because someone brought it for a group, however this time around it was piping hot and unbelievably good.   There are a few reasons this is a 5 and not a 4. These are those reasons:  1) Great staff, loved the friendliness and helpfulness  2) The value, I expected this place to be expensive, but at around 6 bucks for a 4 strip meal...I was pleasantly surprised. That's cheaper than KFC meals, and MUCH better food!  Anyway, will be back... and frequently."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! My Wife and I come here often and the chicken is the best! Not too greasy and their Cane's sauce is amazing and pairs perfectly with the chicken fingers. The portions are generous as we usually share a Caniac Combo (~$10 after tax). The staff here always seems a few notches above fast food and are always very pleasant and in a good mood which really adds to the whole experience! The place seems very clean, definitely top tier for its category of food service!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is fair, I hate that I can't get ranch sauce, only cane sauce. They do not allow substitutions so you end up throwing the coleslaw away if you are not a fan. The drive thru takes forever. The tenders are all different sizes, so when you buy in bulk, it does not nessasarly feed the number of people it states."}
{"text":"My husband loves this place and prefers it over a chick fil a. So I gave it a try and definitely was not feeling it. Our food was way soggy! 3 minutes in to chicken and chill and it's soggy.... the bread was pretty good and service was great but that's about it, our chicken was dry soggy chicken like how?"}
{"text":"Just hard the worst chicken fingers. The chicken was dry and cold as were the fries Really bad!"}
{"text":"The best place to get fried chicken. I love the Caniac combo. I always get extra Cane's sauce. The fries and chicken would be mediocre if it wasn't for the Cane's Sauce. It's a little overpriced, but trust me that it will fill you up and you will be happy."}
{"text":"I received a follow up regarding my comment and went back my order was exactly how I wanted it, extra crispy.  I also decided to try the lemonade and on a 109 degree it was refreshing"}
{"text":"Very fast friendly service. Their drive through lines are long but I love that it moves very fast! Great food and I love the Texas toast!"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's lived up to the hype: it's good fast food, served in a casual atmosphere. It's much better than the rest of the chain restaurants in the area. I love the Box Combo: four chicken fingers, a pile of crinkle-cut fries, coleslaw, Texas toast, and a drink. The famous Cane's dipping sauce is addictive and is a perfect accompaniment to the chicken fingers. Although I didn't care for the coleslaw, the fries and Texas toast were just fine.   The restaurant is clean and the servers are friendly. I'd recommend coming here with the family after a trip to the nearby outlets or you can go through the drive-thru on your way out of Sin City."}
{"text":"GREAT Chicken and love the food, but the customer service at this location is POOR. Went inside for the 2nd time to eat and waited about 30 min for my food, when asking about it I was told there behind on orders... not acceptable, some people who ordered after us with even more people has there food before us. This also happened on the 1st visit and talked to a manager and all I got was it would be out there is nothing we can do.   But other then the service the food is GREAT!"}
{"text":"It's very good chicken fingers surrounded by sucky French fries and sucky toasted bread. The special sauce is good too. I really don't see what the big deal is. They have chicken fingers...period."}
{"text":"So excited that this location opened up. We have already been here a few times but after last nights experience I knew I should leave a review.   The service was fast even with a long line of cars. The staff were nice, cheerful and didn't mind me asking their opinion on the lemonade. The food ( we ordered 2 caniacs combos with extra toast and no slaw) was hot and soda was not flat. Next time I am so trying the lemonade.   Chicken was crispy Sauce was cold as it is suppose to be Texas toast that is never a disappointment Friendly attentive staff that seem to like their job"}
{"text":"Always up for for some fried chicken tenders and french fries I love the sauce but I also know that it's addictive and when it comes to the Balanced lunch this definitely isn't it. But if you like deep fried well then it's darn tasty Cheers"}
{"text":"I came through the drive through with my two kids one evening for some chicken. I knew the menu was limited beforehand, but hoped that the chicken and fries would knock my socks off. Spoiler Alert: They did NOT knock my socks off.   The chicken is pretty good, the fries kind of suck, the garlic bread is soggy, and the coleslaw is delicious (and I'm not a coleslaw fan). The cane sauce is just your basic fry sauce (mayo, ketchup, and a wee bit of spice). There, that covers the entire menu.   It would be so bad except that the price is ridiculously high. I would much rather go to Chick-Fil-A for comparatively delicious chicken and much better other menu items. Sorry, Canes, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"First time at Canes and I really enjoyed myself. The menu was simple and the Chicken was amazing.  It was a little loud, but that's just being a little picky. This will be the first restaurant I will think of when I want chicken fingers."}
{"text":"I only need the three wings to satisfy my hunger but it does not come with cole slaw so I always just order the box and give my extra strip away.  Dip your Texas toast in their Cane sauce! YUUUM  I wish they would open one in SoCal."}
{"text":"MUST EAT, whenever I am in Vegas.   I crave this stuff and it never disappoints.  Sweet tea is yummy and their lemonade is definitely worth the up charge.  YOU HAVE TO dip your Texas toast in the cane sauce!!"}
{"text":"WHAT I ORDERED-- 30 Pieces of chicken strips with plenty of sauce. Came with sides of coleslaw and plenty of more sauce. They packed everything up real well for their to-go orders. The chicken strips were very juicy and the breading was great, but the chipotle sauce is what you come back for."}
{"text":"My experience at this location was unsatisfactory. They must have hired a new staff and did not properly train them because the african American women on duty were irrate, participating in personal conversations while speaking to customers, they seemed annoyed and did not listen for my substitutions (honey mustard instead of canes sauce, replace coleslaw with texas toast). After paying and driving all the way home, I was very disappointed to find that my order was not correct. Usually, this place is great, but i will not be returning.  Thank you."}
{"text":"I LOVE CHICKEN FINGERS! I could probably eat them every day of the week! But sadly, that dream is not going to be reality anytime soon!  Reading some of my other Vegas Yelp friend's reviews, I bookmarked this place in hopes I could talk Minh into going before we hit up the outlets, which by the way is in the same area as this place!  Don't look for anything fancy here; it's just a good ol' drive thru fast food joint. Except when you walk in ::drum roll:: its clean smelling and clean looking! All the employees are actually happy to be working and even greet you!   Since we were having a late lunch, we decided to share a meal and went with ordering:  The Box Combo: Four Chicken Fingers  Fries  Coleslaw  Cane's Sauce  Texas Toast  Regular Drink  There is plenty of seating inside, we found a booth but wasn't 100% clean. Maybe we sat down too quick. An employee was walking by so I asked him if he would not mind cleaning out table. Instead of the rude yeah okay. He was nice about it and even said sorry that the tabletop was not totally clean.   Our number was called and Minh went to go get our food. When he got back to the table, the box was huge. The smell was inviting and the taste was the best! The chicken tenders were lightly seasoned and juicy! I had a bite of the coleslaw and that was pretty darn good too! Texas toast was out of this world yummi (I paid dearly for it over the next couple of days since I cannot really eat bread anymore) but it was worth it! Light and buttery this toast was thick!  The Cain sauce had an interesting taste; it was a unique and went well with the fries (which were not oily) and the chicken strips!  Raising Cane's was built from a dream one guy had. When others turned him down for loan he didn't give up instead he hustled and built his dream on his own. Todd Graves story is amazing along with his dog who the business is named after!   I'm hoping that they will bring this urber rad fast food joint to sunny California soon, otherwise this will be on my list of must have again before we go shopping!!!"}
{"text":"Usually love this place food is always good not to happy I had just sat in the drive through for over 30 minutes for them to tell me I can't get my food cause I don't have my ID for my card. So now I have to drive all the way back home to grab my ID and sit in there drive through again for almost another 30 min cause I'm not going to eat my first order when it's been sitting their now cold. I will not be returning there for this ridiculous situation."}
{"text":"Great food, they are quick, very friendly and want to make your visit a great experience. Manager came by and said hi and went outside and chased off people soliciting customers for $$ in the parking lot ( no hesitation on her end to tell them to leave)!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places I've been told in AZ. I've been here for almost a year and I can't believe I haven't been to this place! The food is excellent! The sauce is even better! 5 star for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok so maybe I went at the wrong time, but this location was packed with rowdy high school kids, it was a little annoying. The service was incredibly slow, I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that this is a new location and they are still working some bugs out. So I amy update this review on my next visit. I will say they were very nice and quite apologetic, so thats a plus. The food is good as well. So here is hoping I do better on my next visit. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"My favorite chicken place to come to. Good always hot and always fast. Love the environment and employees with great attitudes. Highly recomendable."}
{"text":"This is one of my Wife's favorite fast food places. I always forgot about it, but every time we go I say \"dang this is good stuff.\" The Chicken fingers are very substantial and really should be called Chicken forearms. Our family (wife+baby), usually orders The Caniac Club with extra Texas Toast and share it. The 6 giant chicken fingers, fries, Cole slaw, and toast is plenty enough food for us. The signature dipping sauce is very tasty too."}
{"text":"We loved Raising Cane's when we visited Vegas and wished we had this place in Phoenix.  Our wish came true! New hot spot, the parking lot was full of RC customers (we had to park across the street @ Olive Garden), chicken is hot and crunchy like we remembered in Vegas location, friendly customer service and friendly & fun atmosphere.  We now wish for a location close to North Scottsdale:) Whenever we are in Phx, we will stop for some yummy RC!"}
{"text":"I picked up 50 chicken tenders on Saturday morning for a kids birthday party. The employees were great. Polite,  accommodating and clean cut. The manager came out and was very engaging and communicative.  The store was spotless and the chicken was a huge hit. Well done. I haven't seen this in a fast food carryout in a long time. There are a lot of choices in this area but don't pass this one by."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers!!! Husband has noticed the sign the past few weeks on his commute, so we decided to try it out. The menu consists of: chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, Texas toast and a chicken sandwich (which is chicken fingers on a kaiser w/lettuce & sauce). The fingers were awesome - tender, juicy and crispy. The Cane's sauce was good, but I'm not a super fan of it. I usually don't like cafeteria-style fat soggy crinkle fries, but these were thin and crisp - so yum! The \"Texas toast\" kinda looked (and tasted) like a hot dog bun. It had a weird yeasty/frozen taste, and was not super crunchy. Overall, it's decent, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Top notch quality chicken strips!  I became a fan after the first yummy sauced chick strip hit my lips!  The closest I can describe their special sauce is a pepper ranch.  The sweet tea is to die for, and the slaw and Texas toast is as good as the rest if not a hair better.  I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful too.  The only reason why I went four and not five stars is grease.  My strips, although delicious, were just a bit greasier than I would have liked.  Overall though I would love to see a  location in Surprise."}
{"text":"The customer service is top notch especially for a fast food joint.  I ordered the 3 piece chicken finger meal and it was good. The chicken is fried but greasy at all, on the inside the chicken is very moist and and tender not dry and overcooled like most chicken finger/ tenders.   The only downside the breading could use a little bit flavoring.  Overall the food was high quality and not to expensive, I would go back."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!!! I have came to this place twice and I have got my order wrong!!! People that work here give you attitude especially an Asian lady!!! I don't recommend coming to this location!!!!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru and forgot my wallet, after confessing to the cashier, Felicia, she talked to her manager and she gave the meal to me for free. Best canes I've ever been too, the food was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Not sure how anyone can say that this place is anything less than awesome! I got the Caniac Combo and it was so great! Loved the light breading on the chicken fingers and the Texas toast was so soft and buttery. Coming back fo sho! :)"}
{"text":"Alright place to go if you want to try some slightly overpriced chicken strips. I ordered the standard box combo and the food was made quickly. (You definitely get your money's worth on the portion-size).  The chicken itself is nothing spectacular, I like the strips at Chick-fil-A a lot better. The sauce is unique and I'd definitely try it , though the sample they gave me was a bit watery."}
{"text":"Of all the times I've been to Vegas, I've never tried this place until today, and boy, am I glad I did! I didn't think chicken fingers would be so special but these ones are delicious. It's fresh and hot, with meat so tender and perfectly fried batter. The batter was just right, not too thick and very crispy. Better than KFC, Popeyes and Chick Fil A nuggets, even though I still love the Chick Fil A spicy chicken sandwich. The Canes sauce, which some call the crack sauce, was also pretty good. Seems like a mixture of thousand island, ranch and some peppercorn sauce. I just wish they had more sauce options. I love the Chick Fil A sauce and honey mustard. I didn't try the Cole slaw because I'm not a fan of slaw, but I'm assuming there is nothing to write home about it, like the fries. Nothing special. However, the Texas toast was yummy. Soft, buttery, goodness with a nice crisp on one side. They also have fresh brewed sweet tea and lemonade, two of my fave drinks, separate or as an Arnold Palmer. I wish this chain would come to Orange County, CA!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The chicken and fries are hot and fresh. The fry sauce is delicious and the coleslaw is so yummy. We love this place!"}
{"text":"I didn't have to live here long to find out that Raising Cane's has a Las Vegas cult following. I've been to Raising Cane's three times now (three different locations) and this location is the best of the three. I think the food is good, but not something I crave or would seek out.  My last visit was based on the convenience of the location. I had an after work hair appointment and didn't want to go home to cook. This is how I found myself at Raising Cane's.   This location has the fastest line of the locations I've visited. The drive thru was moving and I made it through in less than 10 minutes at the height of the dinner rush. My only beef with the drive thru was how tight it was. At least it keeps out the people that want hangover food.   I ordered the Box Combo (four pieces of chicken) for me and the Caniac Combo (six pieces of chicken) for my husband. The chicken is the highlight of the meal and has a nice breading that isn't greasy. The Cane's sauce has a nice pepper flavor that goes nicely with the chicken. The fries, coleslaw, and bread are average. They aren't anything I would get excited about.  For a place that offers such a limited menu the pricing seems high. My two combo meals came out to $17 and some change. Maybe I'm out of touch since I don't eat a lot of fast food, but that seems high to me."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about the food. However, my cane's sauce was limited. I ordered a sandwich so you don't get extra sauce that comes with it. I then ordered extra sauces because I'm low-key obsess with it. I learned that sauces are $0.31 each so I gave the girl a dollar to just give me 3 and keep the change.  I got home and only got 2 sauces in my meal. I don't mind the few stolen cents but I was sad because I didn't have enough sauce to dip my fries in. :("}
{"text":"Great customer service at this location. Raising Cane's has chicken tenders or chicken tenders... it's a good thing the chicken tenders are really good. The best part is the special Cane's sauce... great for dipping fries, tenders and the Texas toast bread... they do charge $.29 for each side, but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is no big deal. I personally think Chik-fil-a is better. The chicken is decent but it's not as good and other places. The sauce is alright but the best thing they got going for them is the toast and then bringing your food to your table. I don't think I'd go out of my way to get this place again."}
{"text":"Please use a basket when giving out change on drive-thru.  If not, give the paper receipt first to the customer. Not really easy to get out of the car with limited space between the building and my car."}
{"text":"My bro threw Raising Cane's as a recco to me when he found out I was going to Vegas. He said it was a good place for a snack, and he was right.   Bf and I were faced with a dilemma: eat two buffets in one day or get a snack and then close out the night with a buffet. Me? I was down for the former, but he wanted to save room for Green Valley Ranch's Feast Buffet, so we chose to get a snack instead. We hit the location near the outlets, because that was closest to Henderson. It was 2 pm on a Friday and the booths were all full, but the tables in the middle were open.  They basically have chicken finger combos that come with Ore Ida-cut fries, 2/3/4/6-pieces, a piece of buttered-and toasted-to-perfection Texas toast, a 21-ounce drink (self-serve), a small container of coleslaw and a small container of mystery dipping sauce (looks like a combo of Thousand Island dressing with Ranch). The bf and I shared a #1, which was a 4-piece, it was about $7 and it was the perfect snack before a buffet three hours later. We added another soda for $1.59, and I like that they don't try to gouge you on the drinks just because the combos seem really affordable to me.  The chicken was crispy and moist, and it wasn't overpowered with batter. There was a generous portion of fries and they were fried to just the right touch of golden goodness. The slaw was tasty, as was the dipping sauce. Sweet tea is always too sweet for me, so I usually do about 1/2 sweet and 1/2 unsweetened for that perfect combo. I love that they used crushed ice and they serve Coke, not Pepsi. The place is clean, service is really friendly. Great place to grab a snack if you can't decide on what to eat and don't want to pay luxury casino prices."}
{"text":"I feel really guilty for loving this place especially because I am with the \"anti- fast-food chains\" movement in America. But this is the quintessential palace of chicken for me. This is my ultimate splurge of fried goodness. I actually dream of this place while eating chicken at other restaurants.  Why do I love this place so much? Simplicity. Chicken fingers, fries, toast and iced tea. That's the main attraction and that's really all they serve. If you make a good product, stick with it and run with the idea. So I humbly \"bow in the presence of greatness\" and I am a proud member of the Caniac Club."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers here are delish! My only complaint is that it's freezing in here lol"}
{"text":"This is the first time i have ever been to a raising canes restaurant. The food is all fresh, the chicken is never frozen and hand battered to order. Chicken tenders were delicious, had yummy salty crinkle fries, enormous soft buttered Texas toast, fresh brewed sweet tea and coke products which i love! The staff was friendly and the food came out quickly and piping hot. The only reason they do not deserve 5 stars is because the honey mustard costed extra and the only sauce they have is canes sauce, ketchup and honey mustard. Since I dont like the cane sauce or the honey mustard I was seriously bummed that they didn't carry ranch or BBQ. Will definitely return for a Togo order and dip in my own ranch :)"}
{"text":"The food at this establishment is amazing, the 'canes sauce' is extremely flavorful and delicious.  Above and beyond the best \"chicken fingers\" that I have ever had!!! The manager that had the brace on his right hand(June 30th, 2018 @ 3:30 in the afternoon) was quite possibly the most attentive manager that I have ever interacted with in the past. Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Please build more locations- and come to the East Valley! The Peoria location is somewhat close to my office, so Iv'e been to Cane's a couple times. Much like the new fad of restaurants focusing on ONE menu item (a la In 'N Out, Five Guys, Chipotle, etc.) Raising Cane's is all about the chicken finger. And they do it well. Perfectly battered, lightly fried (not too greasy) and served with awesome crinkle skinny fries, toasted Texas garlic bread, and cole slaw it's a great meal.   Leave your diet at home though, this place is creeping with calories. Brave customers can order the \"Caniac\" meal which includes 6 fingers, 2 toast, cole slaw, fries and a large fountain drink. They serve Coke products and also make a fresh squeezed lemonade, which is worth trying (switch to soda if you're not impressed but pay an extra $0.35 to upgrade to the lemonade). Staff is friendly at this location- you order up front, find a table and they bring the food out to you after calling your name.   Make sure to ask for hot sauce if that's your thing. The meals come standard with \"Cane's Sauce\" - which is sort of hard to describe. It's sort of ranch, black pepper, and mayo mixed together? It's really tasty- seems like most people go nuts over it, dipping everything in it (fries, bread, chicken).   Cane's is a franchise chain, so hopefully they'll expand in AZ. The restaurant is named after a pet dog, which is cool for dog lovers- that's the theme- dogs. Decor is kitschy but it works."}
{"text":"My previous rating was 5*, but, if I based my future Cane's visits on today's experience, I would never return. Both the fries and the tenders were double dipped in frying oil.   My 10 year old son brought it up first, and I realized he was totally correct when he said the fries were nasty.   We've been here lots and lots of times and never had gross food. The bread and dipping sauce were fine, but, this crew threw Cane's off their game. Don't double cook the food to save the $4 in cost to your business, because it's probably lost you hundreds in revenue from our family."}
{"text":"The first time I visited this location the food was great and I couldn't wait to get back to it. Then I tried it again a few months later and it wasn't the same. I was a bit disappointed but I'll give it another try at a later time. I love the Cane's sauce and Texas toast. The crinkle cut Fries were delicious but the chicken strips were just ok."}
{"text":"Defin really good chicken fingers. The batter was light and not overbearing where you barely get any meat.  The fries and coleslaw was delish. Prices is cheap for vegas and they are fast! defin will return!"}
{"text":"Their menu is quite simple, it's just chicken strips.  But they're obviously doing something right because I keep coming back for more!  They offer toast, fries, cole slaw, and their special Cane's sauce that is so addicting that I always buy an extra container to dunk everything in it.  You can customize your order by switching out different sides.  I always end up substitute my french fries for an extra piece of toast because its oh so good.    Chicken strips have a nice crunchy coating and is moist and hot on the inside.    Ask for your toast to be buttered both sides, you won't regret it!   If you're a UNLV student, show your ID and you get a 10% discount.  Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, but charging people $1.69 for a small cup of water is beyond ridiculous. $25 for lunch and you can't give my toddler a drink of water??? Definitely leaves a bad taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place. I'm here at least twice a week. I might have to start going to addiction meetings for this."}
{"text":"Ordered food today and found a bug in my lemonade which is the nastiest thing ever when you're at a food place! Then when I go tell the cashier that I found a bug in my cup she turns to another employee and says see I told you, so you guys know there's bugs and you guys are still handing out cups like it's okay? Horrible customer service obviously unsanitary be careful when eating here cuz there might be bugs in your food and they know about it"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Raising Cane's. However, I recently discovered this in my chicken two times at this location!!"}
{"text":"There are a couple of Raising Cane's around town but I like this one because *TIP:* they offer you a student discount with a Rebel ID. I mean, being so close to UNLV, it makes sense, but this is the only location that does it and I don't think a lot of people know about it!  Staff is always friendly and just like any other canes, I love the food."}
{"text":"If you like chicken tenders, you have to come here! It is always and quite small, but totally worth the wait. The sweet tea is amazing as well. YUM!"}
{"text":"The chicken fingers are great but they always put way too much ice in the drinks.  Even if you ask for \"light ice\" they still fill 2/3s of the cup.  It's a pretty blatant ripoff."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Tenders in the whole world. They have texas toast that is very buttery but sooo good! Their secret sauce, is the best!  This is a super cut above any fast food joint in town. Kids love this place.  My niece doesn't like to eat very much.  But one day we brought some home and she tried it and said, \"what is this? this is really good\"   Sweet Tea might be too sweet for my taste, but it's sweet tea! Yummy!"}
{"text":"This is only the 3rd time I've been to Cane's but damn it is good. The do it made-to-order so it's always HOT & FRESH!   After my last review I received an offer from Cane's to come in & try their BOX Lunch for FREE.  If you know me you know I LOVE FREE!!  The staff was very friendly & quite helpful. The food came out quickly.-NOT like In-N-Out Burger where you expect to wait 20+ minutes for a burger.  The chicken was light & crispy.NOT Greasy and the crinkle cuts fries had SNAP! The coleslaw was tasty and the special sauce is good for dipping everything!!  This is one fast-food place you'll never have that heavy bloated feeling leaving. DAMN Tasty Food."}
{"text":"I thought I should write a review for this place because I got an extra chicken finger in my meal... (vegas luck?) and I also won money gambling that day...and it started off with that extra chicken finger!  I ordered #2 which comes with 3 chicken fingers (but i got 4 and I saw it as a sign that I had good luck to gamble haha), fries, and their very buttery toast bread!  Fast food is usually not my thing with all that extra grease and oil, but Canes was pretty good with their special canes sauce that I dipped everything in. I think the chicken is just ok and their unsweetened icetea is pretty good. I mixed the unsweetened with 1/8 sweetened ice tea (otherwise it's just too sweet).  My favorite was definitely the bread though (I would exchange that over fries) :)"}
{"text":"I just called into canes for the mother day special for the buy one get one free . I do not have my card on me so I called before I went to see if they could look up my account by email or phone ?? I was trying to explain the situation to the man on the phone was awful read interrupted me every time I opened my mouth I couldn't even get a full sentence out rude !!! Just rude !!"}
{"text":"A very good fast food chicken fingers joint.  Their very good chicken fingers are moist, not dry.  Good dipping sauce.  Their fries and bread are average to above average.  I don't prefer cole slaw, so I don't rate that part of their combo.  A must try restaurant."}
{"text":"My coworker recommended Raising Canes shortly after I loved to LV. My first trip through the drive- thru I was so disappointed to learn that they did not have ranch to go with their chicken strips. \"What kind of place doesn't have ranch?\" was my first thought.  When I got home I figured out real quick the answer to that is: the kind of place that doesn't need to have ranch. Their cane sauce makes up for any sauce they don't carry and their chicken is so tender and juicy. Now they just need to open one in the Sunset/Stephanie area of Henderson."}
{"text":"The husband brought me here for the first time! Their chicken strips are delicious. Love their fries! Love the tastes of their teas. Friendly staff. We will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Always good, but prepare to wait. New location, great service. Drive through line, even when long, moves fast enough."}
{"text":"This is my second time at raising canes. I think the chicken is awesome,  but my pieces were kinda small compared to the last time i ate at one.  The fries were plentiful but not done all the way so they were mushy. Small condiment area that allows one person at a time so it's a little slow when u have to wait in line for ketchup"}
{"text":"Yum!  Since I don't do burgers - I love a place that does good chicken!  The sauce is tasty, the breading is delicious and the bread is always tasty and the fries are even good.   I generally get The Box with a Sweet Tea which is always too much bread and fries for me, but the chicken is so good!  I also love that you can get a gallon of the sweet tea to bring home!  I am sipping on some right now, and it has been days since we went there!"}
{"text":"Best fast food chicken I have ever had...super cheap and filling. My meal was 3 pieces of chicken, fries, damn good toast and a drink. All for less than $6. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Went in yesterday and Jasmin the manager remembered me from the last time that the service wasn't good and offered to discount my order and thanked me for coming back. Thank you Jasmin, I was not expecting anything and you made my day."}
{"text":"Came here today and went in the drive thru with only 2 cars ahead of me and ordered only 2 Caniac combo meals extra crispy. Paid, then was told to pull up front because of the \"special\" order of \"extra crispy\"! Watched at least 5 cars pull out of the drive thru that came after me and still no order. So I walked in and asked where is my order? The \"manager\" asked at least 4 other employees and they seemed as if they never put in the \"special\" order! I was then told that because of my \"special\" order that it takes a few minutes longer! I'm standing there for at least 10 mins at the counter now, and yes I already put in my \"special\" in the \"drive thru\" but yet watch other customers get there orders and other cars  in the drive thru rolling pass my eyes! The excuse of the \"manager\" saying because of your \"special\" order that it takes 5 times as long is a poor excuse because that's my usual order, and \"hot and fresh\" has nothing to do with it not being fast food! By the way, thinking that a \"reward\" card for a \"box\" combo for \"next time\" waiting now close to 20 mins since putting in the \"special\" order is absolutely ridiculous! I can guarantee this though, from now on when the employee tells me to pull up front to wait, I will put my car in park right there and then and see if they like making ANYONE behind me wait for \"Hot & Fresh\" fast food! Bottom line is to make every single customer feel the same as any other paying customer and never make them feel like you know what customer service is all about but don't. The icing on the cake is they even forgot to put ketchup in the bag because they were in such a RUSH to get me my 2 Caniac extra crispy \"special\" order! Thanks for ruining a normal day for me and my family."}
{"text":"Now I've had Raising Canes before at other locations...and I've always love the chicken, Texas toast and lemonade. This location left me disappointed. The chicken was fried too hard and was very dry. That totally ruined it for me. Yes the Texas toast and the Lemonade were great, but they gave me chicken that was not good. I will continue going to Canes, just not this location."}
{"text":"The food is really good good chicken but sometimes the leamade is too sweet. It's one of the best places. You should try it #1 chicken. It's really good. Coleslaw is sometimes hot. It's ok."}
{"text":"POOR customer service but the food was good!  It was my first time coming here since they don't have these in California. I was expecting southern-style food like Popeye's but all they had was chicken fingers - da fuck? They need to diversify their menu.  The fingers were hot and fresh, the slaw was good and the toast needed more butter. There's also sweet tea and their sauce was the best part and complimented the fingers well.  This location looks new and it's clean. As for the employees, they didn't seem welcoming (none of them greeted, it was more like a GLARE) and clearly hated their job. 3 words: You. Need. Sex."}
{"text":"Very limited menu, I prefer chicken on the bone. But this location is well run. The food has always been fresh. It gets very busy on Friday and Saturday nights, hard to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"Great Chicken, Great Sauce. It's simple and that is what makes it so great. You can't go wrong with the classics and canes does them right. It is always clean and from what I've seen the workers enjoy working there and that is rare at a fast food joint. Fries suck though."}
{"text":"Tried this place again. Food tasted fine and then we found a hair in our sauce. Yeah, appetite lost."}
{"text":"If a fast-food restaurant only serves chicken fingers, I would have thought that it would serve the greatest fast-food chicken fingers I have ever consumed.  I thought wrong.  Very wrong.  The food that I ate left me pondering the mystery of how Raising Cane's has such a hardcore fan base.  I tried the 3 finger combo.  3 chicken fingers, fries, a slice of texas toast and a drink.    I'll start with the good. The texas toast. It's a massive piece of fluffy white bread covered in butter.  The bread is so soft that it could be used comfortably as a pillow.  But, I wouldn't recommend that because you could choke to death by accidentally eating said delicious texas toast pillow in your sleep.  The bad. Everything else in the box. I appreciate that the chicken wasn't greasy, but it certainly wasn't crispy.  The actual meat was dry and the breading was severely under seasoned.  And whatever that Cane's sauce is supposed be, it's disgusting.  It's some sort of a barbecue sauce and ranch dressing mixture that tastes like an unidentifiable somewhat smokey, somewhat spicy, creamy mix of blandness.  It really doesn't say much when the specialty (and only) sauce a restaurant serves makes its underwhelming main dish taste even worse.  Or maybe that says a lot.  The fries were just standard.  Considering chicken fingers are all that's on the menu, I don't see any reason why I would return to this or any other Raising Cane's.  If for some bizarre reason I end up eating at a Raising Cane's again, I'll just order 10 slices of texas toast and call it a day."}
{"text":"I'm hooked. The chicken is tender, the crinkle fries are amazing and the sauce is the best part. Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area and looking for some food."}
{"text":"Came here a couple days ago to try the hype.  The minute we walked in to Raising Cane's, it smelled WONDERFUL.  I mean, wow, we were so hungry, so we ordered:  Cainiac Combo: 6 chicken fingers, cole slaw, 2 special sauce, french fries, texas toast and a large drink (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/raising-canes-las-vegas-3#FjvP2zipmRzAiCj7LdHOFA)  Kid's Meal: 2 chicken fingers, french fries, 1 special sauce and an apple juice box.  The guys who work here are super friendly and definitely work hard!  As soon as you find a seat, they make sure your table is wiped down.  A few minutes later, someone will walk around with food and call your name out.    French Fries - They tasted like the Ore Ida-cut fries from the frozen bag.  It was cold, soggy and some fries were frozen.  After 4 pieces of french fries, I was done.  Chicken Fingers - They were actually juicy and seasoned well, but that sauce was nasty.  I wasn't sure how a lot of people could like this sauce because it just tasted like mayo, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and some garlic powder. It really had a heavy mayo taste and it actually turned me off.  When I walked up to the guy and asked him for BBQ sauce, he said they didn't have any but had Louisiana hot sauce.  So, I mixed hot sauce and ketchup and dipped my chicken fingers and it was definitely better than the weird sauce they gave us.   Cole Slaw - Oh this was gross and had a weird taste.  I think it was loaded with MSG or something because I got thirsty all of a sudden.  I hope they can get KFC's recipe for cole slaw!   Texas Toast - Holsum's Texas Toast from your neighborhood grocery store can be found here at Raising Cane's!   Nothing really special about their toast here, except it's soft and buttery. I've had better garlic toast at my local diner.   Overall, the service is awesome and the workers are super friendly.  It has a family-friendly vibe and it's a perfect place for soccer moms to take the kids here after the game.  After all, the food is cheap and so is the quality."}
{"text":"Less fries more chicken please.  Less bread more chicken please.  Less ice-tea more chicken please.  Look I get that people rave about Raising Cane's, but to be perfectly honest I only believe it to be an okay establishment. It does have its place in many people's chicken strip loving hearts, but my experiences here have been lackluster.  The last time I went I got the 3-strip combo, which comes with 3 chicken strips, french fries, and of course, their tasty bread. I got a Dr. Pepper, because I don't like their sweet iced tea (ohmahgawd! I know.) It's too sweet. It's nothing like my Mother's Texas Tea, and well, she makes it better so she wins, the end.  As for the combo meal, I felt like I had more carbs than anything else. Were the fries good? Ya. Was the bread good? Ya. Were the chicken strips good? Ya. But I felt like I should have had more chicken strips than anything else, and my chicken strips were very much on the small side. If you're going to base your establishment on chicken strips, shouldn't those suckers be BIG, juicy, and plentiful?!   I also made the mistake of taking an order to go. Don't do it. The take-away box makes everything soggy, especially the fries and bread. Best to just eat there, unless you live less than 5 minutes away."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and clean, bright dining room makes me happy. As does crispy chicken, yummy fries, and tasty bread! Cane's has all of these things.  This particular location is situated among a bunch of other fast/sit-down dining options off of a shopping center by Centennial and the 2-15. The place is busy and Cane's was busy, even when my husband and I stepped in a little after 9 PM. This Cane's is open until 1:30 AM. Pretty good place if you have a late night fried chicken craving.  What I like best about Cane's is their customer service. Employees are nice to customers and that makes the ordering process better than most fast-food places. Also, in case you were not aware, Cane's gives a discount to military and military dependents. You will need both your ID and your spouse's ID to get two discounts per combo meal, but it is worth it! With two discounts I saved over $2 on mine and my husband's food.  The combo meals we received were great. Nicely fried chicken strips, not greasy, fries, also not greasy. Came out with the much needed Cane's sauce (for me anyway). And of course, the mandatory chunk of bread. I'm not a huge fan of the bread, but it's all right.  Overall I would return to this locaiton when I am back in this part of town."}
{"text":"Fried chicken, special sauce, tasty Texas-toast style bread, and crinkle-cut fries.  If you can't get down with that, well, I don't know what to tell you, but Cane's delivers.   Always hot and tasty, crispy, yet also moist and juicy - the Cane's way of chicken strips is one of the BEST. Add to this the tasty, slightly salty, crinkle-cut fries and you have a winning combo.  This Cane's in particular is a busy and tends to be a tourist magnet as it is on LV Blvd and next to the Outlet Mall. However, even when it is packed, customer service is not lacking.  If you want some chicken strips that you know will be good and you don't mind going to a chain, Cane's is always a good bet."}
{"text":"So I have been coming to this location since it opened and it is usually really good. The last time I went through the DT though, I got chicken that wasn't so hot and fresh. But I called and they said they would replace it on my next visit with my reciept. I went today and got the replacement food and it was remade hot and fresh. The manager was very nice and apologized and ensured it wouldn't happen again. I will keep coming to this location and the staff are really nice. :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight, and was impressed with absolutely everything. Well-lit building in a decent location in the Arcadia area. I drove here from the Garfield neighborhood and it was well worth it. Juicy chicken and awesome cafeteria throwback crinkle fries, along with one of the best slices of toast I've ever had. All three of these foods were still crispy when I got home, which almost never happens with fast food. I wish I had gotten the girl's name who took care of me. She was cute as a button- very enthusiastic and happy to answer my questions. I'll be back here soon!"}
{"text":"This is our first time at Raising Cane's.  For us, this was a lot of food.  The menu is simple - chicken fingers with fries & toast.  There were 3 of us and we each ordered a 3 piece fingers combo, which consists of 3 chicken fingers, their sauce, fries, a piece of toast.  This was a lot of food for us.  ~$20  At most, each of us ate maybe almost 1/2 of what we got.  Seriously, we could have ordered the 6 fingers one for the 3 of us - 2 adults and a 15 year old. Had we done this, it would have been about 1/2 the cost.  We didn't know but we know next time we can just order one 6 fingers for the 3 of us or if we have our son, maybe two 4 fingers.  Simple menu.  The place was teaming with people, but we were able to get a seat, so not packed.  Service was fine.  Food was fine.  We went through the drive-thru and then realized we should have ordered inside and just ate there.  Love their ketchup packets, but they are big and it can be wasteful if you just want a little ketchup."}
{"text":"Always fresh! Delicious chicken every time, my two boys and I love Canes !"}
{"text":"After the order taker refused to honor the peel coupons that have an expiration date of 3/31, I put an appropriately bad review on here to warn people off if they wanted to use their peel coupons. Shortly after I was contacted by 2 different people from the location to apologize and right the wrong. It is refreshing to see that their management team values customer service. Thank you for taking such quick action when something went wrong."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience when I walked in to place my order.  Since it was my first time there, the young ladies who took my order where amazingly very helpful with making recommendations on what to eat.  The chicken tender meal was very good. If you are looking for something quick to eat, this is the place."}
{"text":"The drive thru line was out to the street.  Went inside to find no line.  The lady working the front counter was so cheerful and helpful.  I did not want combo meals but it turned out with her help combos worked out and saved me on price.  The chicken fingers are incredible.  Love this place."}
{"text":"I can't really figure out why this place is so tasty.  Basically everything you can order is brown in color and is composed of pure fat + carbs.  Oh that's why it's so good.  This is the kind of place for a late night belly filler where you need to ignore your health.  This is likely also a good place for the weekend visitor from LA to stop by on their drive back.  It's just a few short minutes from the strip to the South and has a drive thru.  The chicken fingers are juicy, flavorful, and the \"Cane Sauce\" is uniquely sweet, tangy and practically drinkable.  I was tempted to order more, but one little tub was enough for 3 chicken fingers.  In addition to this, the fries are a bit on the soggy side, but the Texas toast is firm and slightly crunchy.  In fact, this is how I imagine Texas toast should be like.  Considering all the fat and oil in a simple 3-piece meal, I didn't feel it seeping out of my pores like some fast food makes me feel.  It wasn't a pick-me-up or anything, but it didn't put me to sleep right away either.  Worth a visit if you want something quick and yummy.  Still, make sure to go on a jog later and burn all those calories off!"}
{"text":"We love Raising Cain. They have the best chicken fingers and Texas toast. This place is so close to where I work so I would \"treat\" myself every other week. Their customer service is amazing and they offer military discount too.  My daughters are always at a Raising Cain restaurant almost everyday after school. Love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Location: Close to campus, easy to reach from both sides of road  Inside: Kept up by college students so was messier than the other Raising Canes in the city, bathroom was messy when we went  Time are: 5pm on a Friday  Food: Food is delicious as always. Canes sauce is always the best. Recommended based on food but might want to eat at other location if you want a cleaner restaurant. Great college good though."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight.  The menu consist of chicken fingers or a chicken sandwich meal.  I got the 3 pc chix finger meal for 5.99. It came with texas toast,  fries and dipping sauce plus a d drink.  I like how the chix is breaded and moist.  The sauce is really good.  The menu may be limited but I believe that is what helps the service to be quick. I like it and will return."}
{"text":"Prior to visiting this place I had heard people ranting and raving about the chicken here so on my last visit to Vegas I finally stopped by to see what all the fuss was about.  We got the 6 piece meal with bread and fries.  The service was quick and the staff was friendly.  The chicken strips were good, but not great.  The chicken did however taste fresh so +1 for that.  The sauce that came with them was pretty good and the crinkle cut fries were solid.  But I'm left not understanding what all the fuss is about.  I've had better chicken strips before.  But then again I suppose if you're completely shit-faced from drinking all day in the heat then I could totally see how this place would be extremely satisfying."}
{"text":"Went right before they closed. The lady working the drive thru was extremely happy & had great customer service.   We ordered the Caniac combo! Comes with 6 chicken tenders, a side of crinkle cut fries, a Texas toast, side of coleslaw, & a drink!! Came out to $10 & change.   Order their freshly squeezed lemonade. Worth!!"}
{"text":"Wish they had one in Prescott, excellent chicken tenders, moist, good batter, and tasty sauce. Have been to 2 different places and they are consistent. Recommend if u want really tasty chicken tenders."}
{"text":"The secret is in the sauce...I wish they came in packets so I can take some home! It has like a peppery ..zingy taste to it . I had the Chicken Sandwich combo that comes with fries and Sweet Tea to drink. The chicken in the sandwich is crispy and juicy and is topped with the sauce. Yum! The fries are also done just right so they are not soggy . I also love the Sweet Tea here .. it tastes just as good as the Tea at Memphis BBQ. The decor here is fun with different movie and music posters adorning the walls. It gives me something to look at while I'm enjoying my meal!"}
{"text":"Fresh fried chicken tasting chicken fingers. Cane sauce on point order an extra. Lemonade was good and the customer service was awesome I lucked out with the manager or supe because she made my reg drink a large since I said please and thank you! Also doesn't come with refills but I went back to buy one and she remembered my name and just said take the lid off with a smile and boom I was set for my walk back to the outlet mall. That's as good as it gets for fast food ladies and gents! Enjoy and be kind you bunch of assholes! Haha ;)"}
{"text":"A great place for chicken fingers. I typically get the Caniac Combo with extra toast and no slaw. Everything is hot fresh and made to order. I only wish they had a ranch sauce because the sauce they give you does not seem to cut it for me."}
{"text":"This was a great choice for a fast inexpensive meal. Pretty simple menu, which is something that I can appreciate. The Texas toast that is served with their combo meals or on its own is pretty freaking fantastic. The fingers were nice and juicy and the fries hot n fresh. I was not a fan of the house sauce that was served and will probably ask them next time if they have any other alternatives. My kids would probably love this place, so I'm glad it exists and will be back next time I'm in need of a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Best chicken strips in fast food, hands down! Always hot and fresh! The fries are cooked perfectly all the time. Nice hot crinkle cut fries are delicious. The garlic bread toast is amazing especially if you dip it in the Cane's sauce. Their food is always good. Have never had a bad experience. Order the lemonade if it's in season!"}
{"text":"this 1 of my favs... eat practically every week... i usually pick up a box ( no fries, extra toast instead ) and bring it home to some fresh made rice, and vegetables on the stove... i'd like this place even more if it had some type of vege... now I'd give 5 stars but the only gripe i have, if it's called a gripe, is last two times i've ordered, came home and opened box, styrofoam is melted in some places where the chicken was touching it.  I'm not sure if im eating styrofoam or not when i eat the chicken.  It doesn't taste any different so i eat it anyway.  I understand that the chicken is so fresh its probably right out of the fryer and put in box but i wish there was some type of foil or something to prevent it from happening..."}
{"text":"Just as good as I remember! We are Southern California natives, so we've made sure to always treat ourselves to Raising Cane's during our trips to Vegas. We only make the trip a handful of times a year, and have frequented this and other numerous locations in the Paradise area. We ordered closer to midnight so I wasn't expecting the strips to be as fresh, but nevertheless the meal was still on point.   It's a simple menu- a 3 piece, 4 piece, or 6 piece combo, each comes with a drink, coleslaw, (OMG so good and consistent, creamy, chilled to perfection, and beats KFC coleslaw every time!) Texas toast, (buttery, fluffy, light, and delicious) crinkle-cut fries, (manages to stay crisp & the perfect compliment to the strips) and you CAN'T forget the sauce (the best dipping sauce of all time)!! The limited menu only allows for a consistent, quality meal every time, and Cane's has quickly become my favorite fast food meal of all time.   Highly recommend Cane's to chicken lovers like myself, and not only chicken lovers, but those who can appreciate quality, boneless, white meat. I have debated with many whether or not Cane's can stand up to Chick Fil A, and in my opinion Cane's is so much better!"}
{"text":"I love me some Raising Cane's, no matter what state I am in.  Came to this particular location on a Saturday night in the middle of the summer. There was no line and hardly any people inside. It was really weird as all the other locations I've ever been to the line goes out the door and you have to be like a hawk to find a table. It really didn't matter to me, the food was delish as always and the service was good.  The parking situation is not to shabby at this location as there is parking on three sides of the restaurant building itself. There were a ton of cars in the drive-thru so getting down was def a better idea.   No complaints from this happy camper! Thanks Raising Cane's for being so amazing."}
{"text":"This was the best Cane's location I've ever been to! The service was quick & friendly, and the food tasted so fresh! We had a group of four of us and we all got the box combo. It's a pretty large amount of food (four chicken tenders, Texas toast, crinkle cut french fries & coleslaw) and yet it was so good we ate ALL of it! Very happy we chose this as our lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Came with my family. And I fell in love with the basket servings. The spot is nice and clean. The food is good. I would come back. Maybe not regularly but definitely with out of town era for a quick bite between sightseeing."}
{"text":"The owner's allowed us to have a fundraiser at their restaurant for the Uplift Foundation of Nevada and we bought a crowd. The counter people were friendly and they bought you your order. I do like their food and the youth we bought could not get enough. Thank you Cane's and we will be bringing the kids back."}
{"text":"Not bad for the price.  Better chicken fingers than the other fast food \"chicken\" strips."}
{"text":"I'd never heard of this chain until coming to Vegas.  It was right next to some outlets, too, so it was a perfect spot to grab a quick lunch.  The place was hopping!  My friend and I shared the Caniac, which came with six pieces of chicken fingers, fries, cole slaw, texas toast, a drink, and two containers of their special sauce.  I think it only cost about $8 - cheap.  The chicken fingers were pretty good for a fast food chain but what I really enjoyed was the Texas Toast!  It was soft yet sweet.  Delicious.  I also liked their sauce - it tasted like a blend of ketchup, mayonnaise, soy sauce, pepper and sugar.  It wasn't quite as sweet as I had expected (it has a color similar to Thousand Island but it's definitely different) but it went well with the chicken.  Food came out quickly, too, and the crinkle cut fries were nice and crisp.    Great little fast food joint!"}
{"text":"What are my choices? Chicken tenders, fries, toast, slaw......umm ok I'll have the tenders with toast. No.slaw please.... Over priced for overrated tenders. They're ok but nothing to go out of my way for. I certainly won't be a repeat customer. Their special sauce taste bland in my opinion. I prefer Popeyes chicken. Raising Canes needs at least mash potatoes and gravy! Wtf? Also that billboard they have off the I-17 Peoria exit needs to change.... I know the dog is what inspired the name of the place ok I get it but what are you advertising? It looks like dog food. Lol. I seriously thought it was dog food til I stopped by QT next to it and realized it was a fast food joint. Overall nothing special here... Go to Popeyes."}
{"text":"Where the sauce is the boss and the toast is the most. Canes chicken doesn't have anything really spacial about it and the fries are not anything exciting either. But the sauce is amazing i have to get four extra every time to dip my chicken and my fries in it. I am a fan of slaw but canes slaw is pretty bland so I usually substitute more toast for the slaw."}
{"text":"Like the food but this location consistently gets my order wrong. I would recommend finding another location until they get better management and train competent employees.  Problems again. Manager making it right. Hope they can get the kitchen staff to focus on getting orders right."}
{"text":"Woo hoo. We have found another restaurant safe for my son with nut allergies. The chicken fingers are fresh and well breaded and seasoned. Unlike others we like the crinkle cut fries. The sauce is to heavy on the pepper for me. Service is okay. Location has been busy every time we have gone. Iced teas is fresh and not bad. Texas toast is okay if you don't thin of it as Texas toast. All in all a good place to go for an affordable quick meal."}
{"text":"Arguably the worst Canes franchise out there. These employees have no idea what they are doing. Management doesn't seem to care. Shootings nearby. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I realize that I am a fan of chicken with the bone in. I prefer all white meat but not really in chicken strip form. It was my first time here and it was pretty okay. I had high hopes since everyone always says good things about their chicken. I ordered a regular 3 piece chicken combo which comes with garlic bread, fries, and a drink. Their Cane Sauce is actually pretty good and the perfect amount of flavor to add to the chicken. For the price, it is decent for the amount of food you get. I would actually prefer Popeyes over this knowing I can get some juicy chicken from there."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers, hands down. The special dipping sauce is awesome and you always get huge portions. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Im giving this 2* because the chicken fingers are so damn good. I still have a major fucking problem with their policy. I order 6 chicken fingers and they actually expect me to pay for sauce. Wtf kind of a restaurant makes you pay for sauce? If i wanted EXTRA sauce, ok sure, but no. They give me no sauce at all and ask if i want to pay extra to get sauce. How bout get fucked assholes! Whats the number or email to corporate? I will cause a shit storm in their lives! Thats about the dumbest thing ive ever heard at a fast food joint. Wendys gives me free bbq sauce, so does mcdonalds, so does every single fucking place ive ever been to. Suck a dick raisin canes!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Never been as we are from SAN and we're here for the weekend on a quick getaway.  A friend works in corporate in Tx and recommended.  We hit the drive through.   I have a son with a peanut  allergy and the girl that took the order double checked that they use vegetable oil. Chicken is seriously good. Not to salty and the breading is like fried clam breading: crumbly and not too heavy. Chicken is white meat and moist and looks and tastes like chicken. Sauce interesting. I confess that I wish they had other flavors or a spicy version.   They forgot the coleslaw :-(   Sweet tea is VERY sweet.   They are the In N Out of chicken fingers..."}
{"text":"I LOVE Raising Cane's!!!  Best chicken strips ever!  I used to eat here all the time in Louisiana.   The chicken is always fresh and hot, the sauce is amazing, fries crunchy and piping, coleslaw is good, and I even like the toast (although usually too full to finish it.)  One of my fav spots to eat...so glad Vegas has these too!!!  How can you not like a place that specializes in one product only...you got to know it's good if that's all they sell!   Lastly, they are always polite...,Unlike the other rude fast food establishments, where you worry how they treat your food too.   If you have never tried it, you are missing out."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers! Cheap, huge portions, and that texas toast is on point. I hate cole slaw but this was the first cole slaw I gladly devoured. The sweet tea is good too but it's a little TOO sweet for me.. had to drink an extra water on the side to dilute it a little. Overall, a great joint if you're short on time and money."}
{"text":"The family loves this place.  Simple menu and tasty food.  Chicken sandwich or strips?  Either one is good.  The breading is perfect and crispy on the chicken and not too greasy.  Good with or without the cane sauce.  But the cane sauce takes it over the top!!!  Meals come with crinkle cut fries are lightly salted and crispy.  And don't forget the Texas Toast.  To me this is my favorite part of the meal.  I can't explain it but I love it and sometimes even order an extra.  Gotta eat it warm though.  Go at it first cause it will give time for the chicken and fries to cool as they just came out of the fryer.  I top this thing off with freshly squeezed lemonade.  The family likes the tea but I don't mind paying the extra for the sweet tangy lemonade.  Don't go to any other chicken finger wanna be restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  Top 2 chicken place.  Chik-Fil-A and this place for some reason makes my mouth water.  The Texas Toast is buttered to perfection.  Crinkle cut fries crisp and not oily.  And the chicken, man, best tenders I devoured.  I can eat it without their cane sauce but I would not recommend it.  This is the best Canes location we come too.  Service is always good here."}
{"text":"I just recently moved to Arizona and was ecstatic when I found out that Raising Canes had just recently opened up here! I used to live in Louisiana where this place originated and I would eat there probably 3 times a week, I am addicted to it. I read some of the other reviews complaining about how there is no variety and in my opinion that is what makes this place so great. I love chicken tenders, and they make the best. If I want to eat chicken tenders I'm going to Cane's. I find that because they only make chicken fingers they actually make a better quality more consistent meal (don't forget that we are still talking about a fast food restaurant). The lemonade is my favorite amongst any other food chain and I can't get enough of their Texas toast and signature sauce.    If you don't want chicken fingers don't go to Raising Cane's, if you are in the mood for some awesome Chicken fingers and lemonade then this is your place."}
{"text":"OMG why is the chicken so good!?!  Normally I just do drive thru, but this is for my inside Canes experience.   The staff is extremely pleasant.   The place is so clean. Spotless clean. Loved it, not what I was expecting at all.   There was ample seating, comfortable seating, and the cashier will bring your food to the table.   They only serve chicken here and Texas bread, or a chicken sandwich. The chicken has always tastes fresh and juicy. Never once have I had an issue with them.   For a quick bite you have to come here."}
{"text":"I was expecting so much more. I first had visited a Cane's about 8 years ago in Vegas just after the wife and I had landed and we needed to get our grub on. That visit the chicken was juicy, the batter was damn near tempura style, the crinkle cut fries were that perfect balance of crunchy yet soft on the inside, the dipping sauce was a wonderful taste of garlic and pepper and creamy deliciousness and the toast was perfectly toasty and buttery. We were blown away and I have told countless friends that they were the best fast food joint out there. Fast forward to present day and my favorite fast food joint served a dud. The chicken was overcooked, the batter was too crunchy and overdone and my fries were limp. But you say, \"Josh I can see the container, you took it to go, surely that caused some of the problems?\". I say no. The restaurant was a block from my hotel and was only in the container for a short time and could not have caused said damage. If it did shame on Cane's for offering drive thru. Cane's, we will always have Vegas."}
{"text":"This is still an ok place..Courtney was awesome on this visit but she did keep my Canes Club Card so I guess I am no longer a card carrying member...LOL  I don't go here often, I just had a craving.  Prior to this visit, the food tasted like it was cooked in old oil.    This is one reason I do not visit this place often:  . Where can I find Raising Cane's® nutritional values?  A. At this time, Raising Cane's® is in the process of performing nutritional value testing on the food we serve. Thus, we are unable to provide you with the nutritional content information you've requested.  This is from their website..if a place that has been in business for as long as they have and their website still says they have no idea about the nutritional value of their food, it is a place to use caution with when deciding where to go eat.  I know some people do not care what is in their food, a place SHOULD still be able to tell you the nutritional value of their food.  If they do not know then the question is where are you getting your supplies from???  Just saying..."}
{"text":"The food is still decent but they do not offer military discount on the entire menu...they only offer military discounts on combo packs not tailgate packs which I don't understand???  A military discount should be on everything.    Either way, this is still a decent place with good food.  It is hit and miss as to when they change the oil so the taste of the food is not always the same so just be aware if you come across a place with older oil being used, your food will taste different then if you catch a place with fresh oil.  I recommend this place over any other fast food place with a drive thru for fingers and fries."}
{"text":"I could eat at canes everyday! Simple menu of amazing food. My favorite chicken place. The sweet tea is amazing and the service is always great. This location is, in my opinion, the best in las Vegas. You should go check it out!"}
{"text":"Gives chic filet a good run for its money, the chicken is cooked fresh and served nice & hot, it just needs to add Ranch and bar b cue sauces for dipping"}
{"text":"CANES OFF BASELINE IS MY HAPPY PLACE. Everyone in there is so personable (probably because I go more than twice a week). Very clean bathroom at all times. Food is always perfect. I always get the same order with sweet tea. OH Cane's how you have the best sweet tea in the world. It's nectar from the gods. And their special sauce, you have to dip everything in it. Even the bread. I even bought a Cane's t-shirt because Cane's is life hahaha"}
{"text":"Today was my first time to try Raising Cane's. The chicken was very dry. You would think that a place that does nothing but chicken fingers would have moist, juicy chicken. The sauce was flavorful but too sweet for me. The Texas toast was just thick white bread with grill fry - tasteless. I threw it away. The fry's were ok - standard crinkle fries cooked right. I usually give a place a second try but I don't think I will be going there again."}
{"text":"Seriously for fast food you have to give this place a five. This simple menu with the chicken fingers and the spicy sauce and the bread and the crinkle fries it's just amazing down to the ice they put in their soda which is chewy ice it's just really good"}
{"text":"Visiting from Michigan I believe these are the best chicken fingers I have ever had.  The fries and cole slaw were very good. And how come nobody in Michigan can make sweet tea?"}
{"text":"I went in on a Sunday shortly after 11 am. The place was packed, take out only at this point. I waited a only a few minutes in line. The girl took my order and I probably only waited about ten minutes for my food. Not bad at all, especially as mentioned earlier all tables and booths were occupied and there were about three people ahead of me in line. The food also lived up to its standards, as I was a bit concerned since I didn't wait that long for it to be prepared. Side note.. Do not go in on a Sunday around 11- 11:30 am as it is extremely busy."}
{"text":"For a while I saw this place being built and finally it opened.  I was excited to finally try it, but I went a while before I actually did.  Im a huge fan of anything chicken and I guess I thought this was a wing place before seeing that it was literally all chicken fingers.  Ok, no problem.  The food is good.. but nothing blew me away.  I ordered their 4 chicken finger meal, which I guess is very popular.  It came with a side of fries, a piece of garlic bread and some slaw.  My favorite coleslaw is still the one from KFC.  The bread was soft and tasty and the chicken was ok.  The sauce they gave you to dip it in helped.  So it was good.  Would I go back? Sure, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I took my photo after checking in and said I'd write the review after I finished eating... Well that was four hours ago. The food was so good I completely forgot I never even wrote a review. Firstly let me start by saying my wife and I just recently moved here from Florida and were super bummed to find out Zaxby's aren't in the west. However, now our attitudes about that are... WHO CARES?! I mean my goodness the chicken here put Zaxby's to sleep.  Perfectly breaded chicken tenders. Not too much to where it feels dry and not too little to where it feels almost like a lazy effort, but the happy median making the tenders amazingly crunchy to the bite. That crunch is followed by the juiciest tenders I've had in a very* long time. The fries are very good as well. My whole basket was well made. No surprise raw bites in there, no hidden burnt fries, all delicious. The bread?! I'm not sure what's going on with the bread. When you first bite into this \"Texas toast\" it just tastes like normal bread but after you swallow your first bite some hidden deliciousness just creeps up on you! I am so glad we found this place and we will gladly become regulars here."}
{"text":"My love for canes is slowly diminishing. I used to think the food tasted great and was nicely seasoned, but the last 2 times I've come, I don't taste anything. Just bland.  Usually I get the 3 piece but I wasn't hungry so I only got the fries. The worker did hook me up on free sauce when they apparently charge for extra.  They bring the food out to you which was nice but it stopped there. The chicken didn't taste anything special and the fries were way over salted despite me dipping in sauce to mellow it. I left with a stomach ache. Another friend tried canes for the first time here with us and he agreed with me, it wasn't anything special.  Sorry but nah."}
{"text":"I frequent Cane's especially on weekends,late nights it's my go-to spot for a quick grub. A typical box consists of Chicken fingers,crinkle-cut fries,cane's sauce,coleslaw, texas toast and a drink. They are definitely superior to your average fast food,the buttery texas toast alone keeps me coming back.It's a good size sesame seeded bread. The chicken fingers are tender, flavorful and go well with their Cane's sauce.I'm not a fan of the slaw.  Another plus for me is that they stay open until 2:00 am Thursday through Saturday. The drive-through is quite fast considering it's always swamped.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wow the chicken is freaking amazing.  3 strip meal got me full and it was much cheaper than a meal from a big chain fast food stop."}
{"text":"A reasonable restaurant with kind Waitresses. Thank You, Samantha!"}
{"text":"Love them! Yes their menu is small, they know what they do and they do it well!  Chicken cooked perfect, love the dipping sauce and their sweet tea is yum!  This is our usual location, yes there is generally a bit of line, but it moves quickly.  We've always had our order correct and the staff has always been friendly.  Our go to place for chicken if we are out and about."}
{"text":"Fast food....    Chicken fingers are good.    Fries are ok.   Texas toast is Yummy Yummy Yummy!   Lemonade is good.    Great for a drive-thru....    Quick and the price is right!   My son who usually doesn't like chicken fingers and he devoured these..."}
{"text":"I didn't even order. I walked in and the smell of rancid grease hit me so hard, I almost gagged. Absolutely foul smelling."}
{"text":"Here's the deal:  The other reviews that talk about the chicken being pretty much \"Ok\" are on target.  It isn't 'bad' chicken, it's pretty good....it just doesn't \"wow\" you like you'd think it would at a place that pretty much just does this ONE thing.  Chick Filet chicken strips are superior in my opinion, as are Popeyes.  The reason?  Flavor and seasoning.  The strips at Canes are just 'there'.  Not really a lot of flavor.  So why 5 stars you ask?  Three reasons:  1.  The Toast and sauce are amazing.  Like, I mean, another planet-type amazing.  The fries and cole slaw are pretty good, tasty but about average, like the chicken.  But the Texas Toast is the perfect texture, a golden brown toasted buttery slice of body-convulsing heaven.  The Canes Sauce and honey mustard are also both awesome.  So, so good.  2.  The cleanliness of the place.  It's clear that Cane's places a high priority on cleanliness and things looking fresh and clean.  the color scheme is also nice, the entire layout is simple yet fresh and modern.  You actually feel good and calm while you're in there.  It's hard to explain.  Just walk into one and you'll see what I mean.  3.  I saved the best for last.  The CUSTOMER SERVICE is out of this world.  I've been at different times, through drive thru, walk in, and every person has been the same:  bright, friendly, energetic, and seemed genuinely happy to see me and serve me.  Think about it:  we all have bad days.  Days when we're worrying about personal stuff, finances, days when we're sick or don't feel good.  Even in the service industry.  People are people.  We're all human.  But everyone here, down to the cooks and people cleaning the lobby, are fantastic and make you feel like a super star.  This can only mean two things:  a.)  customer service is heavily emphasized by management here, and, more importantly  b.)  these people actually enjoy their job and being there.  That is rare and a great thing.  Final Analysis:  The chicken is 'meh'.  Not bad, decent enough.  Maybe a smidgen above average.  The reason you go here is for the bread, sauces, and the way you are treated and feel."}
{"text":"My friends and I ate here for lunch today and the female cashier and male greeter/ busser / waiter were super amazing. The male greeted us with a friendly attitude and big smile. Then, the female cashier helped us make a decision on what meal to order and gave us advice because it was our first time there. We ended up getting the meal that was around $9 and it fed me, my boyfriend, and friend. The chicken tenders were filling and I liked he toast. Even if they do charge for a large water cup or sauce, it's reasonable because it's extra and everything has a cost. Those resources shouldn't be unlimited because it can lead to waste and it costs money to give us those items. When we sat down, the guy came by and made sure we were having a good experience and said if we needed anything at all, then just let him know. That is amazing customer service especially knowing that as a fast food restaurant, they are likely not to get tips. They seemed genuinely happy, friendly, attentive and helpful. It was if they loved their jobs unlike some other people in the food industry."}
{"text":"Seriously??? This is what everybody is raving about? The chicken has absolutely NO seasoning whatsoever. It is just bland fried chicken strips. The fries remind me of the frozen crinkle cut fries you buy at the supermarket. Then they serve it with a thick piece of buttered white bread, I'm assuming that is an attempt at Texas toast. Come on man!  The atmosphere is reminiscent of a high school cafeteria. It is very noisy in there. The funny thing is all of the noise is coming from the staff in the kitchen.  This is why I rarely frequent fast-food establishments. I definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple cane's locations, but I'll never return to this one. I only ordered a 3 finger combo from the drive thru and it wasn't at a busy time. They made me pull into the parking lot and wait for my food for 10 minutes. It wouldn't be a big deal, but the people behind me in line got their food immediately, multiple cars."}
{"text":"I love Cane's. It's another one of those chains that I only discovered after having lived in Vegas for a while because it doesn't have a strong presence back in SoCal. I used to like Chick-fil-a but I have converted now. I did drive-thru multiple times at this location and they ask for my ID every time and also to sign the receipt. I understand if it's protocol but it's still frustrating because when people do drive-thru they are usually in a hurry and just want their food and be out. This is probably why their drive-thru takes so long if they have to subject every customer to this. Not sure if it's the same at other locations."}
{"text":"Overall, every time I've been here the food has been amazing and same with the service. I've had a few hiccups with messing up orders before, but they always offer a free meal when there's an error. The Canes sauce is fantastic. And the bread?! Delish! I've been here enough to fund someone's college education, and don't plan on stopping any time soon"}
{"text":"A must every time we are in Vegas, we stop and have this. Just love it so much that we take one on our way back to LA. Too bad there are none in California."}
{"text":"Really really GOOD chicken fingers! The Mgr was really nice and gave me a sample of the special sauce so I could be sure if I Liked it. I LIKED IT!  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant, fries and chicken are always nice and crispy. They are never flimsy. The sauce is awesome as well as the home made sweet tea."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this restaurant. The employees take customer service seriously and are well trained. Michael assisted me with my order and was very helpful and informative. The restaurant was very cleaned and well run. The food is delicious.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm not sure, if I've eaten here before. I heard so many stories that there chicken is delicious and the sauce & sweet tea is to die for. So I had to try it. I got the 4 piece meal with large sweet tea!  The chicken was fresh and DELICIOUS! The best thing ever was the special sauce! I dipped the fries, chicken and texas toast in the sauce and they only gave us one container. They need to give us more special sauce. I was actually impressed with the meal overall. I will def. eat it again in the future and maybe at least once a week. A must try, if you like chicken strips."}
{"text":"bland and overpriced.  For a place that specializes in strips, you'd think they would be better than KFC.....they are not."}
{"text":"Raising canes has always been one of my favorite places to dine out and it never disappoints me or my family, also my wife always enjoys the bread"}
{"text":"Have messed up my orders for 1-2 people multiple times and were unapologetic at best, accusing me of ordering wrong at worst because they claimed they didn't repeat back the order I wanted. Not sure if it's because they won't admit their mistake or because they wouldn't anyway, but unlike other places, they won't give you anything as a way of saying sorry. Terribly slow service at the drive through also doesn't help.   TL;DR: will mess up your order, and the customer is always wrong."}
{"text":"If you want quick and tasty breaded chicken fingers this is your place. Whenever I'm in this shopping plaza there always seems to be a line for the drive through so I figured this place must be doing something right to have that much business! We decided to eat in for our first visit and entered to smell the appetizing scent of fried chicken. The menu is very basic and consists of primarily individual combo meals or large party packs. While this does cut down on ordering time I would like a more convenient option for a chicken only package that doesn't feed an army since it seems you can only order by the piece if you want just chicken with no drink or sides.  I went with the 6 piece combo. The sides are already determined for you and are Texas toast, coleslaw and fries. It was ready only a few short minutes after we got our drinks and sat down and were piping hot. The chicken was a large portion, tender, juicy, with a crunchy crispy breading. The breading itself was well executed but a bit plain as I needed the special sauce on the chicken finger to add more flavor dimension to my meal. The sauce itself was pretty tangy/vinegary but had a creamy component to it as well. It was alright but after a while it was too one dimensional of a flavor for me.   Unless I missed it on the menu I didn't see any other sauces available other than the ketchup at the counter for the fries. I really would have liked some hot sauce to go with the chicken fingers instead of the creamy vinegar tasting sauce.   The fries were crinkle cut and plentiful. The coleslaw was cool and refreshing but a bit bland tasting to me. The Texas toast had a salty buttery outer layer and was pillowy soft on the inside.   Drinks are self serve and the options are sweet tea, unsweetened tea, and Coke products.  Service was fast and friendly.   For what it is, a fast food chicken finger place, this restaurant delivers just as it advertises. While I do prefer other fried chicken places better, you can't deny the quickness and efficiency of Raising Cane's!  3.5/5"}
{"text":"love love the sweet ice tea =) tasty chicken fingers and the dipping sauce is just perfect...they also have big portion so for me my daughter and my husband we always order the caniac combo and it fills us 3 =)"}
{"text":"Why is it that the fast food in Vegas is better than the regular restaurant food here in Rhode Island? I can only think of one place anywhere near me that serves a freshly made chicken tender...  The chicken tenders here are just about perfect. They are actually TENDER because they aren't dried out frozen pieces of chicken sponge like they serve at most places. The fries are good, the texas toast is damn good and the coleslaw is perfect.  The sauce though. Kind of like a texas petal sauce. Really different and interesting but I liked it. Then I dumped a package of their Texas Pete hot sauce into it. And I really, really liked.   Five stars, loved everything. And just noticed that they have a location in Boston. That's only an hour away. That's not too far for fast food....is it?"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service at the drive thru. The chicken fingers are huge, more like strips, and fresh chicken breast meat. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.   The only good part of my meal was the coleslaw, which is usually my afterthought and gets thrown out. The chicken was tasteless, as were the fries and watered down lemonade. The sauce? While I understand it's a hit, I HATE ketchup ... The sauce is mostly ketchup, mayo, and pepper ... Yes, I know there are other ingredients. BUT they really should offer alternative sauces since the food is so bland by itself.   I'd like to say I'll try something else next time, but just like no other sauces, they have no other food either lol."}
{"text":"I love this joint!  But okay, when you go to Canes bring company. Then take your Canes chicken finger and ask them to pull it and see what happens...  Actually, I'm just kidding."}
{"text":"i know this cane's just opened but, i had the worst experience ever and i had been to the other canes on peoria and I17. i came in with a big order: a caniac combo and 4 box combos. i sat there for 50 minutes waiting for my food which was to go but other people got there even thou they got there after me they got there food. when i went back to see if my order is done and then the manager told me they will put it back again...waited 50 minutes and then 10 more to have my order. of course for the inconvenient i thought they will give me something as a apology for the wait but there was nothing they asked me if i want ketchup. im very disappointed about that and if you guys want good costumers you have to work on that."}
{"text":"Same problem tonight. This drive thru employee Ana takes her job way too seriously. I'm in the car as a passenger trying to pay for my fiancé and I 's meal and low and behold she can't take my payment because no ID. I understand having to asked prevent fraud but if someone doesn't have it you're going to refuse service? Complete bullshit. That's the last and final straw. I've dealt with this employee's bullshit numerous times but never said a word. Guess I am going to have to make that 20 minute drive to the other damn location, but at this point I have no problem with it because the food is good and I have worked for the company before and do respect the company overall, but this particular employee at this location is a complete asshole. Until the owner of this franchise decides to fire her then I am never coming back. I've never had a problem with any other employee at the location or at any other location for that matter so the 20 minute drive is going to have to suffice."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is like Chic-fil-A. They didn't invent the chicken finger; they just perfected it. (Well that's close enough)."}
{"text":"Ended up going to chic- fil-a to get what i wanted. At Caines I Don't like their sauces and did not want a drink. Cashier tried to sell me a meal. Told her I don't like the sauce and did not want a drink. I just wanted fingers and fries. She told me that a meal would be cheaper. I replied i don't care how you ring it up i only want the chicken and fries. She kept arguing with me so I told her to forget it and walked out.   I just did not want to waste the drink and sauces since all i was going to do was throw them away anyway.   I went to chic-fil-a and got exactly what i wanted since their menu accommodates the choices.   I like Caines chicken but if their help cannot be creative on orders or the menu cannot add the ability to order just chicken at decent price then i guess i will go to chic-fil-a more often"}
{"text":"Sheer greatness, is all that is Canes!!!! Dig your teeth into the delicious, juicy tenders as the crack, that is cane sauce drips from your lips  Ooooohhhh yess, breakfast lunch and dinner good!!"}
{"text":"DANG AND WOAH are words that come to mind when I think about this Canes location!!!!! I couldn't be happier with the staff and taste of the food!!! On my last birthday, they all ( including everyone in the restaurant ) sang at the top of their lungs to me and I had a great time! 10 stars if I could! Check out the picture of the cool staff and me on my last bday on my profile!"}
{"text":"\"See the chicken here is cooked fresh, not refrigerated. You can tell the difference\" is what my friend told me as we took a look at the menu. My friend treated a number of us to either 'The Box' Combo or the '3 Finger' Combo complete with coleslaw, french fries, texas toast, chicken fingers (4 pieces with the Box and 3 with the 3 Finger) , a dip and a drink. It didn't look a lot but I still ended up taking home 2 chicken fingers. It could just be me - I'm not a heavy eater - but the meal was undoubtedly very satisfying.   Also, I absolutely adored how the walls were lined up with movie posters - American Pie, Hangover and all that jazz. It had a very American vibe to it and was just the right place to hang out after having to go through 3 hours of speeches from communication class. Fun, enjoyable, place felt like it was in a rush hour - it was packed and the food was ultimately savory. What are you waiting for, everyone?"}
{"text":"The food was good.  I got the regular chicken finger basket that came with coleslaw and texas toast.  The chicken fingers were nothing special and the Cane's Sauce was alright, not as great as everyone led on.  I am disappointed that they don't have ranch dressing... The coleslaw was good, if you like coleslaw, not like KFC coleslaw but still good.  The Texas toast was probably the best part of the meal, as silly as that sounds, it was phenomenal.  Honestly, this is a quick stop for something different on the go, pretty good overall."}
{"text":"This is our go to location. It is always clean and tidy. I was beyond pleasantly surprised, however, when I used them to cater my daughter's birthday party. They went above and beyond expectations. The general manager, Malcolm, made sure everything was perfect, and even personally delivered the sweet tea and lemonade that I forgot to pick up with the order. These guys truly know what customer service means. Thank you Malcolm!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I couldn't believe how perfect everything was.  Easy menu, GREAT food, awesome service, clean environment.   Secret sauce got me fallin in love."}
{"text":"I went to Raising Cane's for lunch today with the family. This is only my second experience here but it was just as delightful as the first time. Everyone ordered a three piece combo, which came with three pieces of chicken, french fries, bread, sauce and a drink. Surprisingly, each of the meals was a little over $6; lately you can't eat anywhere for that price.   The service was great and super friendly. The employees bring your food right to the table, unlike other fast food places. Overall the place is quite clean. All of the tables are wiped off and set, which is nice considering the amount of business they have. Also, the posters on the wall give the place a nice and welcoming vibe. There are also a few wall cases that have the local schools' logos and attire, like GCU, Moon Valley and Cortez.   On the other hand, if you aren't a fan of the sauce, Cane's would just be an average chicken place for you. The only factor that truly makes it delicious is their special sauce. And if you're a ranch person, they don't have any to offer."}
{"text":"The chicken and bread-delectable. The sauce- good, and the fries-meh. Good price and good customer service. Would go back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Raisin Cane's... I wish I never had you because ignorance is bliss. BRING ONE TO SOCAL! 5 Stars for doing what you do, really really well.  These tenders have the crust and texture of a crunchy thick juicy piece of fried chicken, but... it's chicken tender? Definitely not like your typical breaded chicken tender.  They only have ketchup for your fries and their secret sauce for the chicken, but their sauce is all you need, I would get extra.  So now you already have a reason to come here... but wait!  DON'T FORGET THE TEXAS TOAST, IT'S UH-MAZING!  I always get extra toast instead of coleslaw. It has the softness and slightly sweet taste of a sesame burger bun but they cut it in 2inch thick fluffy slices and toast it on a griddle with garlicky butter.   ALSO, I normally don't like sweet tea, but there's definitely something special about their's.  Every time I've gone there, I've had excellent service.  This is always a last stop on any Vegas trip for me. No matter how hung over I am or how drained, I will eat it there or get a Caniac box for the ride home with a giant sweet tea. Even after a 4-6 hour drive home, it's delicious.... if it lasts that long."}
{"text":"Raising canes is the best dam tender juicy fried chicken on earth .... the sauce is second to none ..."}
{"text":"Cane's is a fast food chicken joint. It's a chain. But it is tasty. There is nothing mysterious. Just simple fried chicken fingers done southern style. With a spicy mayonnaise sauce to dip it in. Fries for a side and a slice of Texas toast. Plus coleslaw. That is it. That's the entire menu. If you like chicken fingers you'll like this place. It's pretty cheap and has good portion sizes. It's comfort food, so don't expect to eat healthy or save calories.  Good stuff.  Only one suggestion for Cane's stores---  Please add GRAVY as a side sauce!"}
{"text":"I've been to different locations and all consistently great. I always go there for lunch so good. Great service at all locations food always fresh and hot.,.love toast and sauce. A must try beats all chicken places."}
{"text":"I'm from California and I was always told to try Raising Canes when going to Vegas. Overall, it was a good amount of food for the price. The chicken was good , but personally I believe that it is a bit overhyped. My personal opinion."}
{"text":"Being from the south I will also be a fried chicken snob. With that being said this place was right on par with one of the best chicken tender places I've ever been. Large cuts of white chicken fried crispy on the outside and super juicy on the inside with a decadent chilled dipping sauce... No wonder this place is always slammed!"}
{"text":"Love raising Canes but this location is a joke.  My 3 piece combo looked like a kids meal w some skinny ass straps."}
{"text":"Raising Canes raises fast food to a new level. Using the analogy that Raising Canes is a platform video game (e.g. Donkey Kong or Burger Time) it would be platform level 4 of 5.    Ever since I wrote my review on the Flamingo at Maryland Raising Canes a year ago, I remain a fan. It just so happened that this past Sunday, when I stopped at the Decatur at Charleston Starbucks, there stood a Raising Canes nextstore. Leaving games of chance for the casino,  before hours of hiking I wanted a meal that was guaranteed to be good. I walked into Raising Canes.   What keeps me wanting to return to Raising Canes is their Caniac Combo. At far less calories, the Caniac Combo probably is just as filling as the Heart Attack Grill. The Caniac Combo is overflowing with food. There is the Texas Toast which to toast is what a baked potato is to a potato chip. There is delicious coleslaw. The plate is overflowing with fries. The fries aren't nearly as good as Chick Fil-A or Nathan's, but they are filling without all the salt that is prevalent in the fastfood industry. Included is two small plastic bowls of Raising Canes sauces. The best way to describe it is thousand island dressing blended with ketchup. In reality there is probably some secret ingredients that are to be kept secret.    The best part of the Caniac combo are the six chicken fingers. This isn't chicken, this is more like Foghorn Leghorn chicken. The chicken fingers appear larger than KFC chicken legs. Using the platform game anology, it's like the Loony Tunes Chicken Hawk finally caught Foghorn Leghorn at the level 4 platform then dropkicked the Colonial and Popeye down to the level 3 platform.    On my visit, there was one glitch. It took ten minutes from the time that I ordered to the time that they brought me my food. At 11 a.m., I was the only customer. That shouldn't happen when it takes less time at the hyper-busy Las Vegas Boulevard location. It was my day to relax and some things are worth waiting for. Plus the employees were friendly. And does McDonald's or Burger King bring food to your table?      When it comes to the game of fast food Raising Canes is a winner. My check-ins at Raising Canes will continue, because when it comes to eating out, I don't play games."}
{"text":"Raising Canes is raising the bar in casual fast food. My first visit in a Raising Canes was a similar experience to Panda Express. I am hooked and keep wanting to return.     Regardless that Raising Canes is named after a canine, it is fast food for a King. At Raising Canes you are not a number. When your order is ready, they will call you by your name. And there are times where they will deliver your food to you.     The combos are abundant in quantity and quality. My favorite is the Caniac Combo. It includes:   *6 chicken fingers..tasty & huge.   *2 canes sauces..little bowls instead of packets. Kind of tastes like 1,000 Island.   * Coleslaw......very good.   * Fries.....tastes like supermarket fries (don't they sell White Castles and Nathan's hot dogs in supermarkets anyway?). Still good   * Texas toast....usually full by the time I get to it.    * 32 ounce drink.....Nothing bad to say about Coke beverages. Still, it would be cool if they had 100 flavors like Five Guys or the new Burger Kings.    The one negative is that Raising Canes is not cheap. To be fair the prices of fast food have escalated in recent times. So $8.96 for a Codiac Combo, which is a dollar above the average fast food meal, is not off the charts expensive.     Raising Canes is raising the standard of fast food. Now when I pass an out-of-business fast food restaurant, I know what I want to see go in there."}
{"text":"Visiting my brother in Gilbert, we had a large to-go order.  Nothing special here.  Hot, semi-crispy, moist, and flavorful.  Dipping sauce was better than the chicken.  This place blows away nasty places like Chik-Fil-A, but pales in comparison to similar fast-food offerings such as Popeyes.  Overall: AVERAGE."}
{"text":"The homegirl claudia need to chill. Opens the window aggressively forced our food in the car. Now I get home & my sandwich didn't have sauce or lettuce. My fries are scraps. :("}
{"text":"Love this place! They have the most flavorful and juicy tenders anywhere!   They are also a very charitable organization and that is something I respect!"}
{"text":"During a recent trip to Vegas, we ate at Bachi Burger, Border Grill, and Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace.  But the meal that we probably enjoyed the most (and was by far the least expensive!) was the quickie breakfast of chicken fingers and crinkle cut fries at 9am at Raising Cane's.  Chicken fingers and fries at 9am in the morning you ask?  HELL YEA!  You know that something was really good when you eat it and 3 hours later while driving down the freeway, you keep on thinking about how good it was!  Why don't we have chicken fingers like these in California?!!"}
{"text":"I was headed over to Sleepy Dog, to get one of the wonderful Pizza's from the food truck provider, Pizza Deux, but they had closed up shop so heading back home i saw this place and decided to  give it a try. Well, I have to tell you, their chicken tenders are amazing! Tender and juicy and just wow, and so well complimented by the Cane Sauce, which is sort of like a peppery thousand island. As for the Texas Toast, okay but seems odd, maybe it is from a different food culture of which I am not familiar. The  fries, nothing special though the coleslaw is light and just slightly sweet and a good counterpoint to the chicken tenders.   I'm not a big fan of fast food but this has an unexpected authentic feel and quality that runs rings around the chicken tenders at places like Popeye's. Looking at some other reviews it seems the reason for the quality of the chicken is that it is never frozen, good to know, see what you can learn from your fellow yelpers?   Bottom line, different from your average fast food chicken place and worth a visit. :-)"}
{"text":"Favorite fast food joint. Bomb bomb bomb! The best chicken tenders and sauce, and toast, and sweet tea! Don't forget to ask for some Louisiana HOT sauce."}
{"text":"A good and decent quick lunch spot for people on the run.  The menu is pretty simple, just different combinations of chicken fingers, Texas toast, cole slaw, and fries.  The chicken fingers are seasoned and fried well and come with a house dipping sauce.  Extra house sauce does cost you a little bit though.  I usually get the Box combo or if you're really hungry the Craniac combo.  I like the Texas toast, not a huge fan of the fries and cole slaw.  You can substitute the coleslaw, bread, and fries for extra of something else which is nice.  Overall this chain is consistent.  This location has fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"You will never get better treatment than from Taylor. THE best and most enthusiastic, and sincere service in my life. Oh yeah, the food is fresh, well prepared and very tasty. If you can find a better fast food eating experience...HA! You won't. Loved it-Thanx Taylor!"}
{"text":"consistently bomb. Always change the salad stuff for some good 'ole Texas toast y'all"}
{"text":"Simple menu, fantastic food. The restaurant is clean and their employees are nice and very presentable. I love all the locations but this one is new and fresh. I hope all will try it out."}
{"text":"SWEET TEA!! SWEET TEA!! SWEET TEA!!  Came here randomly and was very excited that we did order food and not only the sweet tea. We ordered The Caniac:6 chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, texas toast, yummy sauce and a large drink. Chicken fingers are great! Very light on the batter and the chicken, not dry, and was not overcooked aka extra crunchy too! The dipping sauce is crack! Its like a mix of thousand island and bbq sauce.. HEAVEN! Texas toast: buttered on both sides and toasted to perfection!  The sweet tea is good by itself. Think of McDonalds but 10 times better! Our friend reccommend to buy the gallon. Which we did! Who would have thought? Buying a gallon worth of sweet tea at the drive thru. Yes, it comes in a gallon size container. Im glad we did cus it lasted the whole weekend!  I would make an effort to come to on of their locations in Vegas. It is worth trying. Plus sweet tea in the Vegas heat..is refreshing!!  Make a location in the Bay Area..please!!!!"}
{"text":"love it worth at least trying I was in the hotel and ventured off the strip and I didn't regret it at all I went 3 times in a week and right as I was leaving I live in CA so I knew I wouldn't have more anytime soon"}
{"text":"recently moved to Phoenix from California and I have to say raising canes is in my top 3 favorite places to eat. The texas toast is to die for! I love the canes sauce, it's so addictive! It's a great atmosphere in the restaurant, I've never had a problem with this place!"}
{"text":"Friendly faces, from the moment our door was opened for us and even the moment that we were leaving. The staff here are so nice and helpful. They also make sure that our table are clean and free of clutter. Talk about restaurant service in a fast food place. The chicken is always so tender and always cooked to perfection, and THE SAUCE ! THE SAUCE! (Tip: add hot sauce to it) The sauce is to die for. Just love coming here and getting my chicken fix"}
{"text":"Amazing, the sauce is like crack. Cant get enough. Best place on earth. If i had to have a last meal before dying I would quite possibly consider Raising Cane's , they only make one thing, chicken and they are amazing at it. The iced tea should be the only beverage you order , its homemade and tastes different from ice tea regularly found in establishments."}
{"text":"I came into here with high expectations. The chicken fingers were good as was the bread. The sauce for the chicken fingers was different, and that's about it. I can make better sauce at home. The fries and coleslaw were nothing special either, I was annoyed at this place by the unsupervised children, one little group of kids kept \"squeezing\" by me over and over between me and a support beam I was sitting by. That day the clientele was ghetto as fuck. I would not return, just to be annoyed by misbehaving children alone."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple raising cane's & this is probably the cleanest of all the ones I've been to.   I usually just get a 3 finger combo since anything more than that is a little too filling. I'm not really a big fan of toast but theirs is really good! The chicken is always battered correctly and their fries are amazing. The sweet tea is really great too!   The workers are a hit or miss sometimes. Sometimes they're nice & sometimes they're not. Lol"}
{"text":"I tried Raising Cane's for the first time today. I ordered The Box...4 Chicken Fingers, Cole Slaw, Texas Toast, and sauce. I also tried their sweet tea....and I like their sweet tea. Just the right amount of sweet yet you could taste the tea. The fries had me skeptical at first but they were hot, fresh, and good. But it was the chicken fingers that wowed me. Crispy outside, juicy inside, and cooked to perfection. And when dipped into the sauce...I was like wow, I get why people come here so much! And the Texas Toast was the first I've ate the whole piece as i usually hate Texas Toast but this was good!   Add in great service and you get a 4 star review that is really close to being bumped to a 5. I will go back and bring others with me when I do!"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is one of those places where the food is always good, and this location is no exception. I always order The Box, with an extra side of sauce and a large Sweet Tea. And I know by doing so that I am guaranteed failsafe food.   I don't like how they ask for an ID if you use a debit / credit card to pay, and their cole slaw has issues. But the rest of what comes in \"The Box\" from the fries to the Texas Toast to the best dang chicken fingers in Vegas is dang good.   (This is a \"skate\" review as my mind is elsewhere today, in Aurora, CO and focused on the aftermath of the Aurora tragedy. )"}
{"text":"Raising Canes is usually what I call fail safe food. It's really hard to mess up chicken fingers with a big cup of lemonade or sweet tea. And their \"Box\" combo with Texas toast, cole slaw, fries and 4 strips is priced right too. But all that being said this Cane's location found a way to serve some of the soggiest, saddest fries you can find in Vegas. While the chicken fingers were hot and the Cane's sauce was cold as it should be, the soggy fries left everyone disappointed today.   3 Stars.Sorry but the fries just didn't get it done."}
{"text":"Cane's one love is Chicken Fingers. And they prepare them like nobody else. While I miss Chick-Fil-A, Cane's takes care of my chicken cravings in Vegas quite well. A Box Combo, add an extra side of their famous sauce, and a large sweet tea that is some of the best sweet tea I've found beyond what I make myself...and you've got a surefire lunch or fast dinner that always satisfies. Add in always friendly customer service and you can't go wrong by stopping here."}
{"text":"What's this place? Chicken Fingers?  YES! It's so good. Yummy like umami good!  I never had chicken fingers piping hot from the deep fryer. It's finger-licking good I tell yah.  The Bread: I don't usually like having bread with my meals since it makes me full faster but how can you resist Texas Toast. Trust me, get 2 orders.  What to order: If you're petite, go for the 3 Finger Combo and add an extra Texas Toast. The combo comes with 3 chicken fingers, crinkle fries, Texas Toast, Cane sauce and a drink.  For you man-eaters, get the CANIAC: 6 Chicken Fingers, Extra Crinkle fries, Coleslaw, 2 Cane sauces, Texas Toast and a drink.  I don't understand why this place hasn't made it to California. Cane's will give Chick-fil-A a run for its money. Definitely the chicken fingers at Cane's are better, especially with the sauce."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit Tempe, Cane's is at the top of my to do list! Being a San Diego native I do not get to experience their tender chicken fingers and tasty sauce often and whenever I visit it's always a treat. Much better quality chicken than the Anaheim location and consistently delicious! My boyfriend and I usually split the caniac and get extra toast in place of the coleslaw. So good and so much food. The tea is also heavenly. Fav fast food place."}
{"text":"I remembered reading that this franchise primarily serves chicken fingers so when I saw the sign I made a U-turn and walked in.  I bought two to go as well as a small container of sauce. The chicken fingers were light and flavorful."}
{"text":"All they sale is chicken. That's saying they can concentrate on making it the same everytime. I've not been disappointed. Good eats!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while. I mean, even if it's fast food... it's a place that specializes in chicken fingers. That's pretty much all they do. So they have to have the most amazing, flavourful chicken fingers ever, right?   Nope. I mean, they weren't the most awful chicken fingers I've ever eaten - there was some moisture there - but they were bland. So disappointingly bland. The dipping sauce (thousand island dressing?) helped a little, but I won't be hopping back in my car to buy more. Popeyes is further away, but much tastier."}
{"text":"So after 2 years of telling by mom how good this chicken finger place is, when she got here she said I can't wait to try it. She lives in Florida so she doesn't come out here much.  According to her words, \"you're right this place is so good. The chicken is fresh and it not heavily breaded, which I like.\"  Btw the lemonade is delicious too."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's food is good. No doubt about that! But today they messed up my order. Instead of giving my three box combo. They gave me a caniac! Most of you would probably be like: what's the big deal? You got more! The thing is, I don't eat much. I don't even finish the fries! So the food will go to waste. Feel bad for the person who will be getting my three box combo instead of their caniac combo."}
{"text":"I don't visit fast food restaurants often, but I like Raising Cane's! Their chicken fingers are juicy, all-white meat accompanied with a light, crunchy batter. The combos also come with crinkle cut fries, Texas toast, coleslaw, and a delicious dipping sauce (properly dubbed \"crack sauce\") - it's good with the chicken and the fries..and the toast. It's really good on everything!!  The fries are just normal probably-frozen crinkle cut fries, so they're whatever. The bread and slaw are both fine as well. Nothing special about these guys, but they are good with the chicken.  The other menu item everyone really enjoys is the Sweet Tea. For good reason since it's yummy and refreshing. It is a bit sweet for my taste, so I normally do half sweet and half unsweetened for a great balance.  When the Rebels win this season, you can get a FREE Rebels Combo (two chicken fingers, fries, and secret sauce) with your game ticket -- redeemed within 24 hours."}
{"text":"Returned to Canes for a quick lunch. Their menu is limited so if you don't want chicken tenders take your business elsewhere.  Their tenders are scrumptious and juicy. Their fries and Texas toast crisp. Their sweet tea is also so delicious. The place is clean and the staff always friendly. Being further away from canes is one of the main disadvantages of my recent move. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"\"This is so bad... But it's so good!\" If you're looking for a healthy meal that makes you feel good about your caloric intake, this may not be the place for you. If you're craving good fast food, you must drop by & try it for yourself!   Delicious white meat chicken strips that aren't the typical dry ones because these were surprisingly moist! With garlic bread, fries, & a drink, the 3-strips combo was quite filling. Love the dipping sauce & the sweet tea! This place is quite packed but the line moves quickly."}
{"text":"I know people who rave WILDLY about Raising Cane's, but I just think it's okay. I've eaten their twice, once drive-thru another I ordered inside. The service is quick and friendly and the restaurant is always clean. If you want something flavorful, I would suggest going somewhere else. But if you have a chicken tenders craving, you probably can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Ok spot for lunch spot. Fast, easy, and semi-tasty.  Lemonade is wonderful here, just sweet and tart enough to be refreshing and served in a non/styrofoam cup. Chicken is moist and tender. Slaw is crisp. Fries are just ho-hum, so only 4 stars for food. Plus a minus star because they charge for extra sauce, 30 cents a piece and only give you 1 for free!  Bad form when Chick-Fil-A extra sauce is always free. Oh yes, and besides charging us $.30 for an extra sauce they didn't even include it in our bag so there goes another star Canes"}
{"text":"They have ROACHES. saw a roach crawling up my booth inside their restaurant today. Called the 800 number online. Supposedly the GM is Gallo g me back. But BEWARE"}
{"text":"Chicken is melt in your mouth!  Food was great, but the experience was made by the Manager on Duty! She was the happiest fast food manager I have ever come across, especially in the drive thru.   Another great thing is I know the food was fresh, how you ask... it was still hot when I got back to my office 10 min away.   The value is there, because it is great food, at a reasonable price!  Great Service, Great Staff!"}
{"text":"The food is consistent with other Cane's locations I've been to, very good actually! The reason for the three star review is the cleanliness and the staff. I understand that I was visiting during the lunch rush, but regardless, the place was disgusting. Every table that was open was covered in crumbs and straw wrappers with similar trash all over the floor. Cleanliness is CLEARLY not a priority at this location.  The girl at the register was less than friendly and never gave us the honey mustard sauce we asked for. We walked in and greeted her with a friendly, 'Hello! How are you?' She responded with a simple 'what can I get you?' I've gotta say that I consistently have better experiences at the Centennial location."}
{"text":"Although Raising Cane's just opened one by my area in Southern California I decided to try the one in Vegas out when I was in town.  I came here close to midnight on a weekday as Yelp directed me to this one.  If I have to be quite honest I had high expectations for this place.  It isn't bad but I think it's more hyped up than anything.  It's pretty generic chicken fingers and nothing terribly special about them.    The concept is great.  All they service is chicken fingers.  Not a lot of restaurants have this concept where they serve one item.  If you're super hungry go for the 6 strip box but I really think the 4 strip combo box is good enough.  The size of the chicken strips are pretty large.  The coleslaw was decent at best but the Texas toast was good.  The chicken strips are a bit lackluster and dry but the Cane's sauce makes up for it.  Think of a creamy zesty ranch sauce.  The food was hot, I went through the drive-thru and it came out in a relatively timely manner.   Why do I knock two stars?  The food was inconsistent.  Some pieces were incredibly tasty but others just tasted like dried up chicken.   I really want to like this place but until it's more consistent, 3/5."}
{"text":"Visiting family and heard this was a local hot spot. The Texas toast was amazing, the sweet tea to die for, and the chicken was super moist and tender. I will definitely want to try this place again when we return. Also, for people with kids, the kids meals are reasonable and come with plenty."}
{"text":"So happy to have Raising Cane's closer to home!  Previously, I had to go to the Charleston & Decatur location to get these magically delicious chicken fingers, but no more!  Thank goodness for Raising Cane's Summerlin!  Living in Las Vegas now for almost 10 years, I've enjoyed some amazing chicken fingers from both Raising Cane's and Farm Basket.  I myself always get the Caniac combo and I'm even a cardholding member of the Caniac Club!  I love their sauce and their Texas toast!  I am really hoping to one day buy a t-shirt for the place to proudly display my love for them!  Remember folks, great food takes time and they really do an amazing job here at Raising Cane's!  Here's to many more visits and the hope that I'll one day win the FREE Raising Cane's for a Year promotion!"}
{"text":"If I could spray canes sauce as a perfume every morning, I probably would.  If it was socially acceptable to bathe in canes sauce, fill up the tub.   If you could swap out my blood for canes sauce, I would probably die.   But I'd be willing to try it.     Love how quick they get the food to me.  My husband and I shake a caniac combo.  He's a teacher so we get 20% off and it comes out to about $7.50.   Not bad for two of us to eat.     FYI- You can swap out a cole slaw for a Texas toast of bonus canes sauce if you want.  We always get on that so we both get a toast.     Fries aren't mine blowing but I do like them a lot.  They are the crinkle cuts if you wanted to know.   They are fresh and go well with everything.   Fingers made to order.   Always hot, always pretty juicy.   But a little bland to me.  Without the sauce they wouldn't get these taste buds out of there seats.    Staff is always nice.   Noticed that sometimes they slack on cleaning the tables.   And when they do, they shoot the cleaning spray recklessly and it goes all over.    Always a winner for a quick meal that tastes good and won't break the bank.  Just slightly clog those arteries.   So do yourself a favor and eat some veggies tomorrow after your canes today."}
{"text":"I ordered and picked up a large order for a group lunch today.   The food was great, everything seemed freshly made, the chicken fingers were hot and the fries were fresh, not soggy. The group loved the food.   My only gripe is that they didn't give me plates, napkins, or ketchup. I had requested all those items with my large order.   I'll be sure to thoroughly check my order prior to leaving next time. Once I realized I was missing items, it was too late to go back."}
{"text":"Bombast fried chicken with no horrible fter taste. Plus the freshly brewed ice tea= super tasty. Everything was well crafted from the perfectly toasted Texas toast to the freshly made coleslaw. All I can say is QUALITY and great price. That's why u always listen to the locals on where to eat."}
{"text":"Well well well....let's say the experience went down hill very fast after we ordered. I ask to have a table cleaned while we were waiting for our food and was told they would be right there. When the food came I asked AGAIN for the tables to be cleaned so the young lady bringing our food sat our meals on DIRTY tables then went and got a cloth and cleaned our tables. Must admit this killed my desire and appetite. Please tell me this is not a common practice"}
{"text":"This canes chicken is always so fresh, and compared to other stores I think they follow the recipe correctly for the canes sauce because its always on point! Service is Nice as well. Good job guys. Its literally the only canes I go to now."}
{"text":"cant go to vegas and not eat here!! we went when we got there and right before we left! I heard they are putting one in Costa Mesa! I cant wait!"}
{"text":"I wanted something fast for lunch and was @ The Outlet Mall so I grabbed some chicken fingers to take home. The service is very fast and friendly. I ordered a typical combo plate that came with chicken,fries, cole slaw and a chunk of texas toast...and lets not forget the most amazing sauce for dipping those fingers!! Me and my little guy made a picnic in the living room and pigged out. He loved dipping the fries in the sauce! LOL I will never again go to KFC!!"}
{"text":"This places serves exactly what they advertise, I just wish \"light ice\" actually meant \"light ice\" for the sweet tea in the drive through. Being offered ketchup would be nice too, not a huge fan of the sauce that automatically comes with the meals."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about Raising Cane's but overall I was disappointed.  The chicken strips were good and the coleslaw was tasty, I didn't care for Cane Sauce - Mayo, ketchup, and paprika..too heavy and just not for me.  I also thought the toast was a bit soggy and the crinkle cut fries were limp.  The things I do like about Cane;s don't have much to do with the food, the restaurant is named after the owner's dog and they support local animal welfare groups. They also support education and hunger programs and a variety of other community initiatives.  I will return for the chicken strips because they are very good, I'll just skip the sauce and take them home and dip them in a sauce I like."}
{"text":"I love canes, but sometimes the people they hire can hurt the business. Did you know Canes offers military discounts? I use this discount often, but when I went to use it at the rainbow location the staff member forgot and didn't even bother to apologize or correct her error. I called and let the manager know but never heard back. Please hire better customer service staff! Your food is to awesome to lose customers due to workers."}
{"text":"This past Friday I decided to try Cane's on my break because coworkers have said how good this place was. Well let me just say, fighting all the traffic near ASU, while the Tempe Arts Festival was taking place and University shrinking down to one lane was well worth it! Plus even after my 15 minute drive back to work my food was still hot.  I got the 3 Chicken Finger combo which came with fries, Texas toast, Cane sauce and a drink. It was probably the best chicken fingers I've ever had!  The chicken fingers are made with 100% never frozen chicken tenderloins which is marinated for 24 hours so they come out extremely moist. They're perfectly seasoned and breaded, not too much and not too little. The cane sauce is so yummy.  It tastes like it has ketchup, mayo, worcestershire, seasonings but I'm not sure what else is in it, however its excellent, you have to try it! The Texas toast had a crisp outer crust but is soft inside. It was buttered and wonderful. The fries were pretty good basic fries; salted and crinkle cut.  I highly recommended trying Raising Cane's if you've never been!"}
{"text":"Clean and they keep things simple with only 4 items on their menu - so it's great if you're like me and really indecisive.  But ever since they've opened, I feel like their chicken strips have been shrinking.  I remember stopping by the first month they were open and those chicken strips were tv-worthy - think big, juicy, chicken tenders, with minimal batter.  But now, they've shriveled and look like they came from a sub-par kid's meal.  I still stop by from time to time to get my fix of chicken strips, but I make sure to lower my expectations before walking in so I'm not entirely disappointed."}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week, my elderly mother loves the food.  I do, too, it is great.    This review is more for a server (than the food or general service) because I am getting really tired of inattentive clerks.  I had to give my order to Marco three times because he just wasn't paying attention:  two 3-finger combos to go, no drinks.  First got kids meals, after that correction, got the bill with beverages, then eat-in and, FINALLY: two 3-finger combos to go, no drinks.  This happens so often that a clerk is supposed to be serving you and they are talking to others, not listening to what you say, etc.  PLEASE, employers, train your staff to give their customer their undivided attention, it is part of what we pay for and it is annoying to have to give an order 3 times because the server isn't listening.  (Yelp is showing me in San Francisco...I live in Las Vegas)"}
{"text":"Was not all that impressed.  I have hade better chicken strips from a bar"}
{"text":"Always busy, fast, and friendly. Chicken and fries are good but not exceptional. Not enough sauce if you order more than a 3 piece. Coleslaw is ok. Texas toast is mediocre. Very clean restaurant and excellent, friendly service. Atmosphere is pleasant. If you like chicken, check this place out."}
{"text":"Every time I go there they mess something up. Whether it be my extra sauce, which I pay for, adding an extra wing or forgetting to throw in some ketchup even after they asked me."}
{"text":"After my previous review I was contacted directly by a distract manager. They apologized, were inquisitive about how the staff messed up the order, and rectified the situation promptly. I can respect that. That was real. So thanks and I appreciate the great customer service."}
{"text":"Had Raising Cane's this past Tuesday. Although it's good food, what the hell is up with the small ass pieces of chicken? Damn near look like chicken nuggets than chicken tenders. Those things where about the size of my middle finger and that's the finger Raising Cane's need to look at if they think I'm giving them any more money for those little ass tenders. I'll cook my own."}
{"text":"If you want fresh, juicy chicken strips - this is your place!  They only serve chicken, along with fries, coleslaw and Texas toast.  They may have chicken sandwiches....I'm not sure....I only get the Caniac Chicken Strip Combo because it is SO FREAKING GOOD!  I've never had fresher chicken strips anywhere else.  The Caniac Combo is about $10 but you get 6 strips, crinkle fries,, slaw, toast and a drink.  The service is always on point when you arrive.  Very attentive - these people care.  We love this place and it is regular stop for us."}
{"text":"The chicken is pretty good, but the pieces aren't at all close to uniform. The lemonade is good. The staff are nice. But you would think you would at least get a cup of water with your chicken for free? Instead I was charged for the whole cup which was like $1.50 ... for a cup of tap water with ice."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying this place. We were on our way out from a weekend of fun. The chicken fingers proved to be the best choice for eating in the long car ride back home.   The staff was nice, and the place was very clean.   Their chicken fingers were perfectly cooked and lightly breaded. And their dipping is freaking awesome, so awesome that the charge for them. :["}
{"text":"Great spot for chicken wings and the canes sauce is on point. The fries are not any better than frozen food section crinkle fries heated in the oven and come slaw is what it is. The Texas toast though...take it home and put some peanut butter and jelly on it and enjoy...super good stuff there."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the workers are super nice! The Cane Sauce and lemonade are delicious. The customer service at this location is the best I have experienced. We will definitely be back...Lacey provided excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Canes is great place for a fast food joint. We cam here once about 2 years ago and decided to go their again before our road trip back home.  Very satisfied. Great customer service and food.  I recommend the chicken strip sandwich Combo only $6 A little cheaper then Chik-Fil-A. I was told that their is lots of them in the South, just a fact.  i will return again when I am in town."}
{"text":"This particular location has great service!  Great toast and chicken fingers!  The star is definitely the Cane's dipping sauce!  LOVE it!!! (And yes, Matthew, I did marry it!).  I get the unsweetened tea, which is great.  I've never had their sweet tea, but it's really popular and the sell it by the gallon as well."}
{"text":"EVERY TIME I'M IN VEGAS - I'VE GOT TO GO TO RAISING CANE'S!! and the question I leave with...  \"why isn't there one in the bay area?!\"  Brief Summary - Fast Food - Limited Menu, but good at what they do - ONLY Chicken Fingers - get the CANIAC meal - why isn't there one in the bay, dammit?!  OK so first off, I was born and raised on fried chicken. All my Filipino family loves fried chicken. My favorite is Popeye's because that's what we have out here in the Bay. NOW if there was a Raising Cane's in my area, I'd be there!   They ONLY make Chicken Fingers. Which is basically a smaller chicken strip. They're super juicy, fried and crispy. And you dip them in the special CANE sauce. I don't  know what it is about the Cane's sauce, but it's really good. I'm usually a bbq or ranch fan but man give me some Cane's special sauce and I'm good to go.  I like their simply wavy cut looking fries. They're NOT cris-cut frieds but they're pretty simple and I like that they're simple. Not overly salty and not overly crispy.  I love the TEXAS TOAST. My family is a big fan of carbs especially bread and rice. So the texas toast is somewhat similar to Sizzler's garlic cheese toast minus the garlic and cheese. I don't know it's nothing super special but it's tasty.  I usually get the coleslaw too with my meal. I've always loved coleslaw, and I wouldn't rate Cane's coleslaw as the best, I say it's decent and it tastes good. With all the food in my Caniac meal, it's a good contrast to the fried and toasted.  What do I drown it all down with? oh yes, SWEET TEA. I love tea, especially sweet tea. Which is why cane's is so great. It's simple and it's to the point. It doesn't cost an arm and a leg but you get so much food. Caniac is like 8 bucks.  For those picky and people with their noses up *ahem*, expect a simple and tasty meal. If you want a whole bunch of selection go somewhere else. I don't know why people always try to expect a lot out of a simple place like Cane's. They're good at what they do and they stick to it! Why not be good at one thing instead of being mediocre at a whole bunch of things?!  I love Cane's and hope they open one out here in the Bay Area. It would make a killing where I live. I've been to this location and another and I loved this one just a tad bit more. The people were super friendly and it was pretty busy but they keep everything going and get tables cleaned pretty quickly."}
{"text":"This place is getting one star because if they can't stay open for the hours that they say they are then I don't care how good this place is. I work nights and if the place is it supposed to be open till some time and the employees decide to close early to get to cleaning then maybe they should change their hours, that really sucks and is an inconvenience when you only have so long to go eat for lunch that late at night and you have to take time out to find out the place isn't open when it's supposed to be. Never going back here."}
{"text":"Place is amazing!!!!!!!!! Don't see why it gets!a 1 star. The chicken is da bomb and the service is great!! It rocks!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite's! i don't usually go to fast food places, but i just cant resist this place. First of all their sauce is amazing and goes great with their fries and tenders and they Texas Toast. They have many different sizes of meals, whether its more tenders or more sides like their coleslaw. They also have some pretty bomb lemonade and tea which just so happen to make a great Arnold Palmer."}
{"text":"Hoping the 5 star customer service we received is a sign that THIS particular  establishment is making changes in a positive direction.  We came here this past weekend and it was packed! We figured we would have better luck if we went inside and we were right. The line moved quickly and the gal that took our order was bubbly and efficient. She even accommodated my special requests ( additional to go boxes and bags ). Our order was huge!!  Our platters of chicken tenders were hot, fresh and cooked to perfection. The wait wasn't long at all. I noted the manager was very much on top of things. Making sure employees stay up on cleanliness of dining area by removing trash and making sure gloves were being used in the process. 5 stars for great service, clean establishment, working with your employees to make sure all of the above mentioned ran smoothly.  I told him how impressed I was with the gal who took our order and he was approachable and extremely receptive. I think he said his name was Joe, again they were packed!! I like to give credit, where credit is due though.  Our chicken tenders were delicious that's what matters most to me. The limp fries were not a hit. I dont know if the french fries  sat in oil too long or what? Just eww. Resulting in a strike to the 5 star rating dropping it to 4. Room for improvement for sure.   I would recommend and we will definitely return for more tenders!! Will update if needed. For now, Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Slowest service here! All the raising canes are just as busy but the wait is not as long. This location better work on their speed. 45 minutes for just a caniac combo with sweet tea....seriously?!?!?"}
{"text":"Food is always good and hot. Prompt service and very courteous service, especially Dominica!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now actually, once on a whim and once to cater our Superbowl kickback. I've never heard of Raising Cane's or the story behind it, but I definitely enjoyed their mouth-watering chicken fingers. Oh yeah--only come here if you are in the mood for chicken fingers.  The recipe they have here is better than Chick Fil A or anything like that. It's never frozen chicken with something called a \"24 hour marinade\" that keeps the chicken really juicy. As a first-timer, I order The Box and it was more than a full meal. There are a couple of other chicken finger places in Tempe that I have been told to visit, but I will definitely come back to Cane's in the future."}
{"text":"noisy!! blaring rock music, staff screaming order names. long line that wraps around the entire place, there menu has 4 options. dirty booth tables that move and shift about, this was all too much, until my first bite! this is  life changing food! So crispy, melt in your mouth delicious food. Amazing sauce, make sure you get extra! The sweet tea is fire! that piece of bread that you get is heaven! I put  that sauce in my coleslaw and it was the best damn slaw. I will forever love canines."}
{"text":"This location was awesome great staff! Everyone here was extremely friendly. I even had a comedic back and forth with the person doing the drive through PA. Food was excellent as always, only down side was the drive through wait. Was about a 10min wait however was well worth it. The staff did apologize for the wait but no apology was needed. I understand how busy Cane's can get"}
{"text":"The BEST sweet tea in Vegas...spoken by a true Texan.  The food is always fresh and hot.  The line can sometimes be long, but it's worth the wait.  This specific location has a terrible manager that yells at his employees.  This poor girl Amber was crying while she handed me my change, because he was yelling at her.  The drive through window was closed, but I could still hear each and every word he yelled.  Shame on you sir."}
{"text":"5.0 STARS  Location Overview: Although this is the \"closest\" location (still pretty far) for any Henderson Residence, it is well worth the drive. The location is in a good area. This Raising Canes is next to an outlet mall and other food places. The location is good. No bad area other than the highway which is about half a mile away. A little congested with traffic but decent movement.  Customer Service: I have gone to this specific location numerous times and I have always had great customer service. The employees show nothing but courtesy welcomes and a good experience.   Food Quality/Quantity: The quality of this food has been more than perfect every time. I have never had any disappointing feelings towards the food quality at this location. Everything comes out hot and ready to eat. The quantity is more than enough. I have seen a 3 piece combo meal fill up a grown man and he is plenty full.   Side Notes: It does take a little bit of extra time for the food to come out. This location is almost always busy with customers."}
{"text":"When the craving for chicken hits it's nice to have a Cane's near by. I was at work and my coworker and I got super hungry and didn't have much time to stop. Thankfully Cane's was close and super quick. We were able to fulfill our hunger with some amazing chicken strips (and sauce!). Don't forget the Texas toast. It's simple but for some reason always hits the spot. Cane's will be in my mind the next time that chicken craving comes by!"}
{"text":"Chicken is bland, but otherwise, no harm.  Texas Toast is hardly toast, no butter or garlic flavor. NO CHEESE!?!  (and ultimately no veggies, but that's really not a problem for me).  the rest of the items are decent, but nothing memorable about them."}
{"text":"Staff was very good- chicken fingers were awesome but I have to admit the toast was rocking beyond- probably the best we have ever had. I traded my cole slaw for double toast, it is cool that they let you do that. The sweet tea was also very good . They don't do a lot of different things but what they do they are good at."}
{"text":"They have the best employees. The shift manager Mike, took care of a previous issue by comping our meal today. Totally above and beyond service. I was totally shocked and very well-fed, along with my little family. The caniac is my go-to on the menu, swap out the cole slaw for a toast (butter on both sides), extra cane sauce! The lemonade is so delicious, along with the fries. I remember when I first moved to Las Vegas I used to frequent this location because this was new to me! I would eat it about 3 times a week. Now I just have to be careful as to when I eat it, because this is definitely a cheat meal. I love the staff, love the food and the quickness and cleanliness of everything."}
{"text":"A problem happend with my Order two times and I got a call it was the manger this was funky wierd and then she was harassing me the women manger was a fucking weirdo I don't know why she called my phone like I did something bad they really like to pay attention to the people there the people that work there are funky weird and two times I had a problem with my tailgate order I better go 10 miles more than come to these funky people rednecks"}
{"text":"The chicken was moist and the batter was light and fluffy...it was overall good. I don't like crosscut fries, but at least they were the skinny kind. The staff was really friendly. You have to try the ketchup dispenser..it's the best ketchup dispenser evvvvver. I don't give it a 4 bc I never give 5s and for a 4, it's something I'd call home about.  But I loved it. It was good and a good earing experience.  Got full fast. Makes me wonder if there are car enhancers in food. But I'd also suggest just ordering one order. It's enough for 2 adults. Most certainly unless you're a really big person with a big appetite."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more. Chicken fingers were excellent. The problem lies in everything else. There are only four choices on the menu and all are just variations of the same thing. No salads and only one sandwich. The french fries are nothing more than the crinkle cut type you find in the frozen food section of any supermarket. I guess the biggest WTF? came when they told me there was only TWO sauce choices for the chicken fingers...their house sauce and honey mustard??? Really? No BBQ? No sweet n sour? No ranch? No buffalo....etc."}
{"text":"I am sad. Oh, so sad.   My friend had been telling me about how good Raising Cane's was ever since we began the drive up to Vegas, and she talked about it all weekend long: they have the moistest chicken fingers, their sweet tea is the best out there and has such a clean taste, their Texas toast is out of this world! Needless to say, my expectations were pretty high.   Well, we ended up going to Raising Cane's on Sunday afternoon, right before our drive back home. Why we decided to do this, I'm not sure, but thinking back...wow, we were stupid! Anyone who has been through 48 hours of Vegas chaos should know that you probably won't be feeling too great by the time you're through. I managed to take a bite or two of everything - yes, the chicken tenders ARE that moist, the toast IS that good, and the sweet tea IS that clean - before I started feeling nauseous. After about 10 minutes, I had to admit defeat; I closed the lid on my \"Box Combo\", laid my head down on it, and waited for my friends to finish.  Sad, sad day. Raising Cane's...please open in California!"}
{"text":"This place SOooo reminds me of Zaxby's in Georgia with their \"sauce\". I'm not really sure what's in the sauce other then yum. But it Is pretty fantastic. The chicken fingers really look like white meat chicken and not that processed stuff. It even tastes like the chicken fingers I make only the batter isn't littered with cayenne pepper. The meal is simple with the chicken, fries, coleslaw, texas toast, and fancy sauce. I actually like their sweet tea too. I'm not big on sweetened tea. But this is pretty southern authentic ;)"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is the place for fresh and perfect-breaded chicken fingers! Juicy (not dried), piping hot and fresh chicken fingers + extra fries + Sweet tea. Nothing better than that on a summer day where you want to refresh and have something quick yet delicious!   This location is very clean and the cashier is welcoming and always ready to order.   The food is always consistent and fresh.  The good part is you can always do substitutions. My sister doesn't like their Texas toast (a preference) so she ask for substitution of extra fries which they were willing to substitute.   Always ask for extra sauce as well! One of the reasons for coming back to Raising Cane's is for their sauce.  As for the Sweet tea, it is a little too sweet even with an entire cut of ice. So what I have found is that doing half no-sugar sweet tea + half sweet tea is the perfect sweetness for my taste."}
{"text":"hit or miss really...had it great and had it not so great....but what really irks me is if you ask for ONE extra sauce (once after getting 28.00 worth of chicken)they want to charge you....really ? It's the point of it...obviously I can afford it...but I think that sauce should be on tap out front.  I can get really good chicken fingers at Carl's Jr. and they give you all the honey mustard I want which is just as good. So I usually bocott this place even though it's one block from my house. ..."}
{"text":"This place was next to the Target and looked interesting. I tried their box special that included chicken strips with sauce, texas toast, cole slaw, fries and a lemonade. Everything cooked was piping hot and the cole slaw was nicely chilled. The lemonade was very tasty and they also used crushed ice which is really good. They really do cook the chicken after you order it. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Raising Canes has two fatal flaws that prevent it from being something truly enjoyable for me. The first being the pedestrian cafeteria style crinkle cut fries. Today my fries had a horrid stale oil aftertaste. Canes needs to do something about their bland fries, maybe take a page from wing-stops book and season them and upgrade to a skin-on frozen fry or even cut their own in house. I think the fries are nasty and generally not worth the calories.  The second flaw is that the menu is completely boring. There are no flavors of chicken fingers to chose from so you are forced to order them plain. What about a seasoning rub? What about dipping them in sauces? You may have 1 love and primarily focus on chicken, but why not offer different presentations of your flagship item?  Cane's gets credit for dealing with a perpetual flow of student eaters and gets your food out hot and fast every time. Still, I can't eat here often not because I can't afford it but because the calorie content is super high. Today I wished I spent those precious calories on something with a big more flavor. That, and each combo box is $1-2 overpriced, $9.80 for 6 fingers? whaaaa? Next time I will order them a la carte and skip the fries, slaw, bread, and diabeatus tea."}
{"text":"Great fast food that tastes better than \"fast\" I found this location to be a bit noisy - lots of hard surfaces and not many booths.  Would have loved an outside patio table..."}
{"text":"Fast service, classic cane's! Great for a quick snack for yourself or the kids."}
{"text":"I've seen this chain in Texas and Nevada. Wish they had it in California!!!!   The special sauce is so delicious. You can order the sauce in a large container to take home.  Chicken tenders are plump and juicy. The fries are seasoned and the thick slabs of potatoes....not the matchstick ones.  I love this chicken place and look forward to going everytime I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place a few weeks ago and loved it. But I just went today and my chicken fingers needed salt.  The lady at the drive through with pink hair was extremely rude.  She was speaking to quietly and I don't her I couldn't hear. You could hear in her voice that she was annoyed.  I told her I just wanted chicken fingers anf she automatically said we don't do that.  But the sign said 1.49 per chicken finger. So I told her and she said how many then and it doesn't come with any sauce. I said no thank you and a large sweet tea.  She was telling me to pull up and I said did you happen to get my sweet tea. You can hear her sigh and say so you want sweet tea? Small or large?  Of course I wanted sweet tea why would I ask for it. When I pulled up she wouldn't even look at me. Then she practically threw my food at me. Which was bland a gross. She didn't even say have a good day or thank you. Idk who ever is the manager you need to retrain the chick with pink curly hair.  If she doesn't like her job (that's how she acted)  maybe she should just quit.  She was working on 9/2/17 at 10 something am. I give it 2 stars because I like the tea."}
{"text":"I absolutely love everything about this place! The food is so good. The Texas Toast, the coleslaw, and the chicken fingers are to die for. Oh and you can't leave out the awesomeness of the lemonade they serve.   The Thomas Rd location is always busy but the service is fast and correct the first time. Ample seating for large groups or families is also a plus. And the customer service is awesome! One of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow. I've tried both the drive thru and walk in. The staff doesn't seem to have any sense of urgency. Waiting over 20 minutes for fast food is unacceptable ."}
{"text":"Have heard this is place to get chicken.  Totally disagree.  There is something in the breading that I can't put my finger on that gives it a unique taste and one I can't say my family loved.  Chick fil a so much better.  And if you want sit down goto LOLO's."}
{"text":"Got lost in the sauce! Wow! Can you say finger lickin' ? Um, yaaaaaa! $7 and I'm fully satisfied!"}
{"text":"A very simple concept of a handful of items on the menu that has always been perfectly executed. I have yet to be disappointed by this location of this awesome franchise.  I came in and ordered my food and it was ready within minutes without it tasting or looking like it was sitting under a heat lamp or recently heated up. Everything was correct and tasted of being fresh/recently made. Fingers and fries were hot and crispy. The garlic bread was toasty and garlicky. The cole-slaw wasn't overly sweet. And I got the extra sauces I ordered.  I wish more places I ate at would be as consistent with their food and service as this establishment is. I have been eating Raising Cane's at this location for years and I will keep going back."}
{"text":"I think its great. Love the bread!!! Comes with everymeal! Fries are great and moist chicken..."}
{"text":"Mess up on orders 70% of times. Food is good. I recommend ordering without modifying menu to avoid paying extra and not getting what you wanted."}
{"text":"It's my first time at this location & it's now the closest to my house. I'm used to Raising Cane's customer service being equivalent to In N Out. I usually see young people working here but delivering incredible customer service, in store & at the drive-thru. I did not receive that this time around. The girl running the drive through was extremely rude when she was taking my order. She was very monotone, until she kept asking me to repeat my order. When I spoke up louder asking, if she heard me...she yelled very rudely, \"Yes, I heard you! Is that all!\" I was not complete with my order, so I told her the rest and she continued with her short attitude.   When we approached the window we asked for ketchup and hot sauce, which we did not receive. The girl handed us a drink & then spilled our next drink. Instead of saying sorry or anything, she just filled the same cup up with more tea & put a new top on. When she handed the drink to my husband she didn't even wipe the sides off & it dripped all over him, as well as our car.   I will definitely never be back to this location. I've never had a bad experience with Raising Cane's but this one was very poor & disappointing."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Simple menu with tender chicken strips, fries, toast, and SWEET TEA!  YEAH!  I actually give this place 4.5 stars because I found the slaw to be somewhat bland.  Been at this drive-thru two Vegas trips in a row, now.  They should open these in Orange County.    Attention, Raising Canes Management - Portillo's of Illinois pulled it off in the OC.  You can too!"}
{"text":"By far the best chicken strips I've tried in Vegas. As a new vegas local, I'm constantly trying new restaurants, and Raising Canes is definitely a must go for tourists and new vegas locals looking to try quality delicious food. I always get the 3 chicken strips with their crinkled fries with their delicious toast. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Out if control is all I have to say bomb ass lemonade, juicy flavorful chicken, garlic butter Texas toast heaven is all I have to say don't sleep on this place."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars if I was rating on the food and customer service only!  However, as a business sometimes what patrons you brings you down as well.   Let's start with the chicken; it is really, really good.  What is better than the chicken; the bread!  Anyone who has eaten here knows the bread is killer.  The sauce, yep, don't forget about the sauce it to is killer, and will draw you back for more.   The customer service is outstanding. The young kid with the \"poofy\" ( I mean that in a nice way) who brings out the food is a sweetie.  The counter girls are also very efficient, even though it is so busy in there.   Now, the chaos!  The patrons!  This place is super busy during mid day and there were a group of rude, loud, obnoxious girls in BIKINIS eating while all the mothers inside were trying to distract their kids from noticing.  One of these scantly clad divas came up to my table while my son was alone, and just grabbed a chair.  No asking, no excuse me, no nothing.  Fortunately, for me and her I only needed 3 and not 4 chairs. I didn't want to have to embarrass my kids with a scene.   I have since gone to the Henderson location and it is just as lovely minus the Divas!  Love Raising Cane's....."}
{"text":"always take my family from out of town to raising canes cuz im not sure where else they have this business. love the toast. chicken is obviously tasty.lol everyone needs to give this a try if they never had it before"}
{"text":"We picked up a large catering order in the restaurant last Saturday.  We were there right in the middle of the dinner RUSH, and the staff treated us like ROYALTY.  We were shaking our heads as we left with our order, marveling at how they can prepare 100 chicken tenders (all HOT), countless pieces of toast, cole slaw and TWO TRAYS of french fries with Cane's Sauce in addition to serving their eat-in customers during the dinner rush.  AMAZING.    Plus, the staff was polite, cheerful and went the extra mile to pack the food in such a way as to make unpacking especially convenient.  They made sure we had everything we needed and offered to help us carry it out to our car.  Whoa.    This restaurant, their management and their staff GET IT, and they are quite special.    NICE WORK!"}
{"text":"BEST.FOOD.EVER! And the sweet tea is to die for!! My fav! You can be sure your food is always hot, the staff is in point and friendly, and the tea is refreshing! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Still my all time go to when I'm hungry!! Everything from the Texas toast to the sauce, to the lemonade is amazing! My husband always buys a jug of the sweet tea for later. Sometimes the line is a little long but it's worth the wait. The staff is super friendly too!"}
{"text":"This place is insanely good. I'm from southern California, so we don't have this place anywhere. Let me say, the chicken fingers are to die for. I basically had a perfect experience. The girl working the cash register had a great attitude too! I forgot her name, but she had a very peppy vibe that definitely rubbed off on me! Definitely should be noted. If you've never had Raising Cane's, do try. It's not just chicken. It's Raising Cane's."}
{"text":"Heard such great things about this place.  We had time to spare so we exited early and went here for a late lunch.  The chicken fingers are really tender and moist.  When I think chicken fingers/tenders, I imagine an overly breaded piece of nothing that is dry and stale.  Not here.  Not at all.  This was nicely breaded and the chicken was amazing.  Who said tenders/fingers are for kids?!  The best part was the sauce.  Most of their meals comes with one or two, but I ordered an extra for 30 cents or something.  I guess the other best part was the freshly brewed sweetened tea.  Brings me back to when I used to live in the South and where sweetened tea is their specialty."}
{"text":"The crunchy hand breaded chicken fingers always hit the spot. The special \"Cane's sauce\" along with the thick buttered toast and a sweet tea compliment the meal well.  This was my first time visiting this location, and everything was up to the standard I've come to expect of this chain. If you're a fan, you won't be disappointed. If you've never tried it, you definitely should check it out."}
{"text":"Their menu consists of chicken strips and chicken sandwiches which is just the chicken strips on a bun. The chicken is all white meat and lightly breaded. Super moist and melts in your mouth. If you get a combo it comes with their special made sauce. Fries are okay and sweet tea is pretty good. I gave this place only 4 stars because the chicken is always fresh but the sauce is terrible. My kids rave of this place and absolutely love the sauce. I'm not too impressed but I would go back."}
{"text":"If you are reading about Raising Cane's, chances are that you have been here already, or know they are known for their amazingly fresh and crispy delicious chicken tenders and secret Cane's sauce.  This review is for those who think fries and a tasty slice of Texas toast is too much to handle with your tenders.  Every time i get gas at QT i hit the drive thru and order just 3 tenders and 1 Cane's sauce, and it satisfies.  Update: got soggy strips last time, they said my next meal was on them, they replaced the strips but charged me for the sauces because they said I didn't claim there was anything wrong with them previously, past couple times I came, I was nickel and dimed for an ice water in the drive thru. Was"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite chicken house! The Cane sauce is AMAZING ! Too bad they don't serve desserts there..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love chicken fingers!!! They are so nice and friendly at this location too! They especially love my pug roger and almost always give him a treat! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always good, service is great, and the sauce is to die for!Yum"}
{"text":"I'm really torn on how to review this place.  I wanted to give it more stars, trust me.  But the more I think about it, the worst I feel.  I mean, this place isn't bad, I just left kind of feeling meh.  Here's why.  For starters, I will say I love the service I got here.  The girl behind the counter was friendly, upbeat and really nice.  That's the one thing I liked about this place. Other points, not so much.    The menu here is really limited.  You basically have 4 menu options to choose from. That's it.  No side items, build your own meal, nothing. I'm a girl that likes options, and sometimes I don't want a gigantic meal, just parts of it.  So I went with the smallest order I cound find, which was the 3 chicken strips, fries, drink and Texas toast for $5.99.  When the food came out and it wasn't half bad.  I felt like the toast could have been cooked a little longer, even though it was really yummy.  Fries could have been a little crispier, and the chicken wings were pretty good.  Overall, the food was good, and not bad, I just wasn't moved or overly impressed with it as a whole.  Plus, I don't think you can get different dipping sauces, even though their \"secret sauce\" was quite tasty. What I mean, was I didn't see an option for ranch or bbq sauce on the menu.  I wish they had more menu options here. I know you can only cook chicken so many ways, but it would be nice to see a salad, or a la carte type ordering, which they didn't have.  Service was great, and overall not a half bad experience."}
{"text":"Canes is one of my favorite fast food places. I rather eat here than BK, McDonalds, Wendys and so on.  If you are going to eat here, you MUST get their chicken fingers EXTRA CRISPY, or the breading will fall off. Also, i highly advise using salt and pepper because they dont salt anything, which is standard for most places seeing that some people have different standards of how salty or peppery they want their food. The fries are normal french fries, nothing fancy. The sauce is a nice touch to their chicken fingers for sure. As far as the menu, its small, simple and to the point. At canes they do chicken fingers, and in my opinion they do them well. But to each their own.   Are their fingers 5 stars, eh they arent 5 stars but they are very good. The service is questionable at times but for the most part good."}
{"text":"My friend from Vegas raved Raising Cane's, and we went there after having a couple of drinks. I'd say it's good drunk food, hungover food, or cheat day food.  The menu is mainly made up of fried chicken fingers, French Fries, and breaded fried chicken sandwiches. I wish they had some vegetable options. My vegetarian friend was extremely unhappy here haha.  It's fine to try but I wouldn't seek it out."}
{"text":"The best part of canes is not having to decide what you are having for dinner.... You are having chicken fingers. They are good as they are cooked without being rock hard. Fried are alright and cole slaw is good. Don't understand why someone needs a half loaf of greasy toast with their fried food."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, I tried this place when visiting my parents in AZ and it's AMAZING!! We need them down in San Diego area please!! Such good food!"}
{"text":"Drive thru is always fast! Love that this place is on my way home!! Hard not to go here when they are so bomb!!!  Order the box with extra toast! Get em"}
{"text":"Great food with fast and friendly services. I love how crispy the chicken tasted. But the only thing I didn't like was the fact that there wasn't a larger order of fries to chose from."}
{"text":"Some of my wife's co-workers recommended Raising Cane's chicken so we gave it a try.  The chicken tenders, lemonade, sweet tea and Texas toast were all excellent! The homemade sauce is kind of weird to me and they wouldn't let me switch it out for something else which is not a customer service friendly policy. They also didn't have BBQ sauce which is a staple with fried chicken in half the country. This was the only reason I gave four stars instead of five.  A clean and well decorated store with great food! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time eating at a Cane's and the first time at this location.   Their stores are all fairly new and look really nice on the inside and outside. They are also very clean. I am leaving a three star review instead of the four star review that they could have gotten because of the fact that they don't offer BBQ sauce or ranch dressing. I realize they feel Cane sauce is amazing but it's basically ranch mixed with thousand island dressing. If you're not a fan of thousand island dressing then you won't like the sauce. And they charged me 34 cents extra when I asked for a honey mustard sauce! (Which did taste homemade)  The chicken fingers are really good, the Texas toast is good, the sweet tea and lemonade are really good! The fries are so so. The service was good and there is ample parking as well.   Good enough to go back but not worth the 20-25 min wait in the drive through on a Sunday afternoon!"}
{"text":"everytime I come this weekend and its clean and I love the bathroom it smells like candy and the water is warm great customer service quick"}
{"text":"I always come to this one bc its always clean! They have good customer service and are pretty efficient. .CANE SAUCE. .. I'M ADDICTED TO. .. YUM."}
{"text":"yummm.. i could eat their toast alllll day. lol  this is my faaaavorite place to get chicken fingers. the chicken is always consistently good. crispy..juicy.. and the size is perfect.   i normally don't like crinkle cut fries but i like them a lot here. sometimes crinkle cut fries can be a bit soggy but here... they are on the thinner side so they stay crispy.   i like their secret sauce but i am not like blown away by it. but that's ok cuz i come for the chicken fingers and not the sauce.   i've found that you either love or hate the sweet tea. if i could i would make a meal out of the toast and sweet tea. :)  this location is super clean.. everyone is super nice.. and i think even the manager comes out and asks how your meal is going. awesome for a fast food establishment!"}
{"text":"i'm really picky about chicken fingers. esp. cuz most of the time they're really dry. but i love them here. and i love love love the texas toast. i get the snack pack.. it comes with 3 strips, fries, texas toast, and the sauce. and of course a drink! their sweet tea reminds me of the arizona sweet tea thats 99 cents.. which is such a steal.. IF you can find it! at least i know where to go when i dont feel like hunting down the cans. last month at work they were giving away coupons for a free strip meal so i hope more ppl find out about this place. theres the one on charleston and decatur in front of walmart and lowe and thats the closest to me but i dont feel like looking up the address bla bla bla..  $6.13 for the #2 combo.. better than paying that at kfc for a strip meal and not even having a drink.. plus their canes sauce is better than any ranch, honey mustard, or bbq that any place can offer. zesty..creamy.. and oh so yummy..  oh! and if you get the other combos that come with fried and coleslaw you can get a double side of fries or slaw.. or another piece of texas toast.. (get the texas toast!)"}
{"text":"Get lost in that sauce!!   I visited this location on 3/13/18 around 5pm and our server Sergio was incredibly friendly and attentive. He was informative about the menu and helped us to get the best deal for our chicken needs. The bread was perfectly crispy and the chicken was juicy and hot and the sauce was boss. Get lost in the sauce. I love this location for its cleanliness and customer service."}
{"text":"The place was packed, there was a line about 8 people deep.  It was really noisy and there were no empty tables.  I think they could have done a better design to keep the people in line better, it spilled into the dining area and blocked the walkway.  It made it hard for people to get drink refills and for the staff to empty the trash.   I wasn't crazy about the food runners yelling out people's name.  John 2 loafs, Janet 3 loafs, Pete 1 loaf.  What's a loaf?  I thought I was there to get chicken?  The shouting just added to the noise and commotion there.   On to the food.  I've never had Canes before.  Everyone was talking about it like it was some sort of Mecca of fried chicken.  I got a Box Combo that had 4 pieces of chicken, fries, coleslaw, toast and a drink.  $6.99  I suppose that's a decent value for the money.    The chicken strips is what we came for and I was expecting taste beyond biblical proportions.  They were OK.  I've had better strips from chain restaurants.  You could tell they were fresh, they were breaded there.  The breading was tasty, it certainly wasn't pre-made and frozen.  They were just average and they were a little on the small side.  They expect you to fill up on the other stuff I suppose.  The fries were absolutely nothing to write home about.  They were probably frozen.  Mine were mushy and had no real taste to them except salt.  The coleslaw was good, it could have used less dressing, but it's hard to make good slaw in huge batches.  And the toast.  That's their gimmick, it was good, light and fluffy and had a good taste.  Probably the best part of the meal.  Then there was the sauce.  I suppose if you just want to eat a cup of flavored mayonnaise, it was fine.  I had a few dips of it, but passed.  Canadians put mayo on their fries, not Americans!  To drink, I had their \"Fresh sweet tea\", I just knew it would be too sweet so I cut it 50/50 with regular tea.  It was good.  I could tell they didn't filter their water.  The ice had a weird taste and so did the tea.  When will restaurants learn they can't use tap water in Arizona?  There's not much here I would expect them to change, they are a chain restaurant.  They obviously have a following as was evident by the crowd.  My suggestion to management is put in some sort of system to tame that line.  Put a filter on your water and ice.  Otherwise, it was as good as I expected (which was 3 stars).  I'm sure my review won't sway you from trying this place.  I was curious about it like you.  I suppose I'm one of those people who just expects a little bit more out of their fast food dining experience.  There are plenty of other places around to consume 900 calories for lunch which will satisfy me better."}
{"text":"I was surprised by this place.  When I first seen it, I was thinking it was just another fast food joint. When I had gone in side. I was like, \"whit is this, it just have chicken fingers? What gives.\" Then I ordered and, Wow.\" The food was great. And I can see why specialising in one foid type, really makes a difference. Service was good, inside was clean and well decorated.  Though the price is a bit high."}
{"text":"This is the other Raising Cane's I've visited (the other in Grove City, OH) and the complaints are much the same... it's a little pricey, the sides lack flavor (especially the fries), and the staff just don't seem to give a sh*t about being there and have no care that you can tell.  But if you've got a craving for mechanically separated chicken breaded up all tasty-like, you'll probably manage to enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times over the years my friend is obsessed with this place! Honestly I think it's a little overrated there's nothing spectacular about raising Canes. The chicken strips are decent but they are quite small. They give you a tiny portion of fries when you order the combos I thought it was a kids meal. The sauce is ok but nothing amazing I think it's just ranch mixed with ketchup. I do like their sweet tea and fresh squeezed lemonade. The prices are decent so that's always a plus. There is always an extremely long line through the drive-through so I prefer to go in. This is the Las Vegas is version of Chick-fil-A. I will come back if a friend wants to go but other than that I can do without canes."}
{"text":"this is in comparison to the raising cane's in california (orange location). so having it once before i expect a place to have consistent quality. i appreciate that this has GREAT service. multiple people working behind the register to get my order out quickly as well as for them bringing the food to you. so in comparison to the other location the reason why it was not a 5 star review is because yes, the chicken and sauce were consistent... but the lemonade (which i paid extra for) was not very good and didn't tasty as refreshing and lemony. also the fries didn't seem as fresh.  come here if you're trying to get some good chicken... and a large meal for a good price but eh, i like my chik fil a fixin better..."}
{"text":"The only chicken place I had really been to around this area was Popeyes. A friend took me here the other day and wow. The food is great. I ordered the caniac, it was so much food for 9 dollars! The fact that you can also substitute the cole slaw for another piece of the amazing Texas toast is awesome. The fries are also really good! I will be making a return to this location, the workers were really friendly and I think next time I'll get the 4 piece instead of 6 haha. :)"}
{"text":"This is the place to go right here!!   I have never heard of a chicken strip-and-fries-only establishment before but dang it sure does work great!  I was really impressed with the food and for sure walked away with a borderline carb-coma (which was fiiiiiine by me!)  Not only do you get awesome chicken strips with a crazy tasty coating, you also get crinkle cut fries, coleslaw, and freaking Texas toast!  Oh yeah the dipping sauce is nutso too, I was told its a mayo-ketchup-creole season concoction and it jives together perfectly."}
{"text":"The caniac combo is perfect for sharing! It includes six high quality chicken breast tenders, a large order of crinkle-cut fries, a piece of Texas toast, coleslaw, a large drink and two super secret Cane's sauce. The food here is cooked to order, so everything was hot, crispy and delicious. Their lemonade is made with pure cane sugar and definitely worth the 30 cent upcharge! Although their menu is very limited to those items (there's also a sandwich available made with 3 chicken tenders and lettuce on a kaiser roll), they do it well!"}
{"text":"Delicious! (Way better than KF.... The other chicken joint) Tender chicken with crunchy skin, excellent fries, & garlic bread! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"The chicken strips are amazing I would recommend this place for  it's not too expensive"}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed, first time eating here. Major downside for me is the flavor of these chicken fingers. There was none actually...no flavor or seasoning in the breading. Its crispy on only some parts of the fingers, big no-no for me. I really like my chicken crispy all around. To be honest, even KFC has more flavor and more crispiness and thats just sad. Chicken fingers were pretty big in size and soft however they were also borderline dry. Hence I had to dip into the canes sauce and ketchup like crazy to make the tenders more tasty and tolerable. I kinda regret ordering the caniac combo, after eating my third chicken finger, I couldn't force myself to eat anymore, just too dry, bland, and not crispy :(  The combo came with crinkle fries, which tasted good as long as I ate it with the canes sauce hehe. The sauce tastes better with the fries than the chicken itself surprisingly. The sauce sort of reminds me of thousand island dressing mixed with lime juice. The coleslaw was nothing special. The texas bread, was just toasted bread with butter. Service was super quick and the cashier was nice. Unfortunately, I think this will be my first and last time I'll visit here."}
{"text":"One of the better fast food fried chicken places we had tried. My bf really liked this place. We needed some food on the drive back home to California and decided to stop by here. We got the 4 piece chicken which came with their special cane sauce, fries, Cole slaw and also a bread toast. The toast was really light and fluffy. It was good. My bf really loved the Cole slaw as well and the chicken so super soft and tender! The cane sauce went well with it and they also have ketchup as well. Service was super quick. Wish they had this in NorCal!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm just not into fast food, because this place did nothing for me.  Why they got 3 stars:  Service was swift and courteous. Chicken was fresh and hot. Chicken was actually chicken, not nugget substance.  Why they did not get more stars:  \"Texas toast\" looked and tasted like a hamburger bun. Didn't eat it. They must have walked across the parking lot to Target to get frozen fries. These just weren't any good. Didn't eat them. The \"secret sauce\" tasted like mayo mixed with a bit of catsup and Lawry's seasoning. They promised tangy and a bit spicy. It was neither. Didn't eat it. Oh, yeah, wasn't I supposed to get cole slaw?  So, of the boxed meal I ordered, I ate the chicken. The rest wasn't worth chewing.  Overall, the food was entirely meh."}
{"text":"It's tough to give a fast food chain 4 stars but this is by far my favorite. I just call it \"crack\"cause it addicting. I love the crispy outside of the chicken. The meat is definitely high quality. The sauce is perfect and the Side bread is incredibly tasty and incredibly unhealthy. Crinkle cut fries are perfect."}
{"text":"Not sure why but I it seems they have changed portion size. I have loved this place but I just ordered the 3 finger combo $7 and was disappointed the chicken strips look smaller, and fry portion is smaller. Disappointing they can't stay consistent. These are more like nuggets ."}
{"text":"she is beauty, she is grace, she is canes.  canes has my whole heart.  nothing else to it :')"}
{"text":"Great food and a amazing staff always quick and foods hot and delicious. Mike always takes good care of us. Will be back soon and often"}
{"text":"The staff and manager are friendly and the atmosphere always feels upbeat whenever I go in.  The lemonade is very tasty!  The chicken and accompanying fries and bread consistently taste good.  I wish they would offer fresh (made in restaurant) ranch dressing and other side options.  I typically take my food to go via drive thru. Service has quick which is helpful when one is on a limited time lunch break.  It's very close to my work location which makes it a regular place to go for lunch.  They cater!"}
{"text":"this is going to be a super short review...because it is what it is a fast food restaurant that sells chicken fingers.   The things that popped out to me was one the sauce made everything dope...the freshness of the fried chicken fingers , and the toast. We don't have this in California so i wanted to jump at the chance to try it.   It was good i have to admit..this is a spot if you're in a rush to get the funk out of dodge or  need a filler for one of your meals in the day or something to fill up your tummy from a night of galavanting in a city full of alcohol.   I'm a little disappointed that we don't have this in cali...but Bombskis nonetheless  thanks Nicole and Jay for the heads up on it."}
{"text":"Its chicken fingers so I thought how hard is it to make them right.  Not only did they do it right; they did it SPECTACULARLY."}
{"text":"Probably the first time I've had a chicken basket that the chicken was not horribly deep fried.   The breading was flaky and perfectly balanced with the moisture of the chicken. Needless to say- forget the other big name places- best chicken basket I've ever had."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  Canes sauce....Freaking yummy!!!  Texas Toast...YUMMY...  and the chicken so moist and juicy, not greasy or or nasty.  I cannot wait until the one on the West side of town is finished so we can eat it more often.    Wish they had a few more options on the menu but in all..most of my family love chicken and fries.  Thanks Canes!"}
{"text":"this place was okay.  I liked the fact that they had a drive thru and it's easy to eat when you're on the go.  - chicken - tastes like real chicken.  it's tender but a little bit dry - fries - they put way too much salt on there.  ask for no salt and put it on yourself.  better yet just eat it without salt,  healthier lol - butter bread - yum! crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I like! - dipping sauce - it was okay.  goes with the chicken but not that great - coleslaw - didn't like it. had 1 bite and threw the rest away   overall they have one close to my house in Costa Mesa.  I would come back if I'm in the mood for chicken and fries"}
{"text":"Yeah, it's fast food. But the amount of food that they give you and it's all good.   The chicken was delicious and their sauce? Spicy and perfect. The slaw was decent. And the Texas toast was delicious. I was so full after I ate and so full of self-hate and loathing.   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while outlet shopping....LOVED this place.    This place was busy but not crowded. Staff was friendly and treated you like a member of their crew - very refreshing and welcoming.  Chicken fingers, fries and Texas toast are excellent....and the secret sauce was out of this world.  Sweet tea definitely hit the spot  - especially on a hot Las Vegas afternoon.  Before leaving, I ordered a gallon of sweet tea (knowing I could not have anything like this in California.)"}
{"text":"Whenever we want \"junk food\" but don't want to feel too terribly guilty, we go to Raising Canes!  The chicken fingers are juicy and perfectly cooked every single time!  The Caniac Combo is perfect for two.  Dun.  Avoid McD's and go to RC!!!  Customer service is always good too!"}
{"text":"Kinda bothered right now after paying for a 4 finger meal and paying extra for the infamous Cane's sauce, but ending up with no extra sauce and they also messed up my friend's order as well. When prompted to pay at the window, we had the girl re-read our orders (initially putting the 2 orders together), which she read correctly the second time. I know drive-thru can be crazy at times with so many orders coming through, but it's a little frustrating when you don't get your extra Cane's sauce you pay for and when your friend doesn't even get a Cane's sauce with her combo meal :/  Definitely going to In-n-Out next time"}
{"text":"A great suburban Mecca for suburbanite kids, their families, even single travelers. Fun for all.   As this is their opening night,  seems to be a high school meeting place.    This place is like all the other Raising Canes. Great chicken and a simple menu. You can combos or just chicken. The best part is that it is finally in Henderson!  I like all their choices. However I got this for the family. I am focused on healthy eating so I am not sure what I could eat here.   This is their opening day and it is busy.   Definitely an added addition and judging from the teens it will be quite popular.   Take out is a bit slow and so is ordering but perhaps it is just opening day!  GK says check it out but bring your patience."}
{"text":"If you have a bunch of kids or picky eaters, then this is the place to go.  I would give it a 5 star based on this only.  However, since the fare here is fried and breaded, I have to lower this due to fitness and health reasons for kids.  Ok, I do admit I liked it regardless.....  1.  Chicken Tenders - Very tasty, tender and the right size. Juicy and piping hot.  2.  Fries - Great when hot, however if you order to go and bring them home, they need to be properly warmed up.  3.  Sizing - They have all sorts of sizes for the appetite and the prices are reasonable.  Several times I have ordered a tray of the tenders and the fries. I usually go for the 25 piece tenders and find them just not enough...  Clean and Easy toilets, great parking, and fantastic service.   GK says, for fast food, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of fast food. You won't find many reviews for a fast food place. This place does rate oddly enough.  a.  Ambiance - For this \"east\" part of town, very nice. Clean, good flow and organization. At 4:30 on Friday, it was 75% full.  A great testament either to fast food or good quality.  b.  Service - I really like the consistency and the good service from the people cooking, the cashier, the people prepping your order. High quality in my book.  c.  Food - They do a few things and do it very well. Fresh made chicken tenders, fries, texas toast.  I find the tenders to be awesome for a breaded fried product that I normally stay away from.  The toast is great. The fries, no go.  d.  Price - Can be reasonable. I spent 85.00 ordering a tray of 75 chicken tenders, served in 3 tin foil trays and 1 tray with fries. Very reasonable and a lot for the money.  e.  GK says, this place is NOT bad at all. Highest level of fast food I have tried besides In and Out."}
{"text":"Today's Father's Day \"Box to Box\" buy one, get one... Staff,  Management, \"Wayne\" clearly clean, customer service, in my book. Mistakes corrected, Special Sauce, (2) instead of Cole Slaw. Thanks To All. We will be Back."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers are excellent and not to mention the Texas toast which was amazing.  My only complaint is that they wanted 31 cents for a tiny container of sauce. They only give you two containers to begin with, which is  inadequate."}
{"text":"For me canes is a once in a while type of place. I sometimes end up feeling like crap after eating but it tastes so good going down. Go to is box no coleslaw extra toast, with an extra sauce. The sauce is really good with everything on the plate. The fries are perfectly fried and so is the chicken. Sometimes they give me over fried chicken so the breading on it is too hard so I end up picking it off. This place also get busy sometimes so seating is limited."}
{"text":"I came here visiting a friend in Vegas. Best bang for your buck. The chicken is moist while the outside is extra crunchy. Love the simplicity of their menu: chicken tenders ahaha. Everyone who works there also were so nice. This is pretty much a fast food joint and a worker had walked to my table to give me my order."}
{"text":"I will be honest I am a HUGE fan of Fried Chicken in most any form. Typically I am a dark meat type of girl but Raising Cane's has DELICIOUS batter and quality chicken. This was my first time at this location and everyone here was super friendly and they are on point as far as making sure food arrives in a timely fashion. The food speaks for itself but this is my favorite canes thus far because of the quality service and friendly smiles and fast delivery of the yummy food.  DONT forget to try the cane sauce but if you aren't a fan you can always get some yummy honey mustard!"}
{"text":"Being from Denver the closest location to me would be the one in Fort Collins Colorado. So it wouldn't be a Vegas trip unless I went to canes to grab a caniac with extra toast and canes sauce!"}
{"text":"Went there & no healthy options!!! All Sugar in everything & KFC or Churches tastes better!! Tea is bitter & instead of making a better kind it is turned into a sugar syrup"}
{"text":"Went back and chicken was better...still a little room for improvement but I did bump it up to 4 stars"}
{"text":"I have always gone to this location for food and never have had any problems till now. I ordered a Caniac combo with no coleslaw, no toast extra fries with an Arnold Palmer. A 3 finger combo no toast extra fries with a Dr Pepper and then 4 extra sauces. I did not get extra fries and I only got 4 sauces total and last time I checked the caniac 2 sauces and the 3 finger come with 1 sauce so I should have gotten 7 sauces. I will post pictures of our boxes and the receipt because we got charged for everything even the extra sauces."}
{"text":"Great fast food, chicken was fresh and all white meat, zero fat with a great breeding. Fries were adequate, and toast was awesome!  I hardly eat fast food but when I do this is on the list."}
{"text":"This canes is horrible. I just go to this location because it is right by my house. Every single time I go I get my fries and chicken extra crispy and they literally screw it up every single time. Have wasted so much money at this location."}
{"text":"Our friends ordered Raising Canes to go. This was my first time trying it. The chicken was good and so was the Cane's sauce. Basically what makes this is the sauce lol Otherwise the chicken fingers weren't anything special to me and I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat this. I'm generally not big on fast food in general. It also may have been the fact that on this Vegas trip I've been drinking a lot and eating everything. So I didn't have much of an appetite for it. Maybe I'll have to give it another go when I'm more sober haha"}
{"text":"Three stars because the food is good but the business is not firearm friendly. Their \"no weapons\" sign is about the l size of a small postcard and is placed in such a manner that, unless you get real close to it, you'll miss it hidden on the bottom of the door behind thick window tinting. CCW carriers beware."}
{"text":"This spot is really simple but crazy good. I luv a good piece of chicken and the strips they do here are crispy and tender and the sauce is like crack! The fries r crispy krinkle cut like DT and great esp. with sauce. Cole slaw is simple better with some sauce. The toast is buttery and is a great contrast to the  whole meal. Finish it up with the homemade sweet tea and thats one meal! The only question u should have is how many do i get? Answer: always more.. Or can I have more sauce! I do not recommend takeout tho everything gets a lil soft."}
{"text":"Was happy to find a drive through open late (till 1:30 am).  The staff was friendly and proffessional even close to closing. The chicken was fresh and juicy. The dipping sauce is their own special recipe. It is tasty with the chicken and the fries. They also have the cutest ketchup packets! The combos I ordered came with soft and fluffy garlic toast, fries, and coleslaw. The fries were not greasy and the coleslaw was crunchy and fresh. I got half sweet tea and regular tea. My husband got the lemonade. Both tasted good and not too sweet. This is a great fast food place for chicken strips in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place and I love it even more now that it's in Henderson. The times that I have been there it has not been very crowded and my order has been taken fairly quickly. The employees there have always been very friendly.  Now I have been to the raising canes at Beltz and if you do not get there before 11:30 it is very difficult to find seating but at this location there is more seating available. Food has always been great and the sweet tea has never disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place! Try not to go here too often but I can't resist. Especially after shopping at Belz for awhile.  It gets pretty busy at this location around 12 and on so get here early or possibly be prepared to wait around for a table. What can I say about Raising Canes but the fact that they have really great tasting chicken fingers. If there were a chick fil A nearby it could be a tough decision.   The dining area is decent sized and they have movie posters, rebel memoribilia, etc as decor. Customer service was very friendly and at times they have promotions with UNLV sports."}
{"text":"*EDITED* Although our first visit was definitely a disappointment, they have redeemed themselves and offered for us to try it again. After emailing the company, they reviewed the video and confirmed that our food was substandard. Hopefully we'll love it this time around!  I will NEVER eat here again. For the amount of money we paid, I wish I had taken all the food back and got a refund. I guess my only complaint is the chicken... Which was the whole reason we went!!! We got 3 meals and every single one had dried up, old chicken tenders. This was our first time, this can't possiby be what all the reviews rave about!!! I'm not exaggerating when I say I would not be surprised if these were from the day before. And this was on a Friay night in Vegas!!! Beyond disappointed"}
{"text":"Worst Cane's in the Valley.  Constantly serving soggy ass fries. And they ALWAYS forget my extra sauce!"}
{"text":"I guess as far as Raising Cane's goes, I'm in the minority looking at all the 5-star reviews this place has been receiving.  For the unfamiliar, this is a fast food joint that specializes in one thing, and only one thing - chicken fingers. That's about all there is to this place. All they have are chicken fingers, fries, bread, their signature Cane's sauce (and basic sauces like ketchup), and drinks. Nothing else. There is ONE KIND of chicken finger, so if you're expecting a place like Buffalo Wild Wings where you can go in and get your chicken cooked in one of 15-or-so types of sauce, go back to sleep. Variety is the spice of life, and Raising Cane's doesn't have it.  The staff here are always friendly and have a positive attitude, however I find it annoying the way they ask for your name if you're dining in (this is so they can call you up when your order is ready.) Can't they just give a number like other fast food restaurants?   And then comes the biggest blow of all - the food isn't that good. These chicken fingers are so oily inside that the outer breading practically hangs off of them. I have heard of people from the office I used to work at getting sick here, and after having tried these fingers, it isn't hard to see why. The fries are nothing worth writing home about, and I think they could easily have come out of a frozen Ore-Ida box. The so-called special Cane's Sauce is just fry sauce with a few extra spices thrown in (and it isn't special and unique in any way when you consider that the Chicken Now place in the nearby Outlet Mall has practically the exact same sauce.)   For your chicken needs, go elsewhere. This place has a limited menu, lackluster food, and nothing that really makes it stand out. Nearly any other fast food restaurant has better chicken products and more menu selections."}
{"text":"This is a newer chicken place in town. They server Chicken Fingers, Toast, Fries, and their special Sauce. If anyone has ever been to Lucky Wishbone in Tucson, it very much reminds me of their chicken fingers meal. It is excellent and their homemade lemon aid is to die for. We always have to order extra because we fight over it.   Slightly pricy for a fast food place, but you do get the quality you pay for and they have a club called the Caniac Club you can sign up for and get free meals.  Whats not to love? As my 2 year old says \"Bok Bok Chicky!!!\""}
{"text":"Came in on June 24th at 3:30 PM. This place was still really busy for that time of day! FIRST Time here. Ordered the kids meal 3 Pc. chicken finger combo $4.19 & the Reg. 3 Pc. chicken finger combo $6.99. Both meals come with a drink and fries. Show pictures of the combo meal with a side of slaw never got that, but the best tasting thing was the garlic toast..They have a \"special sauce\" that's served with the combo as well. It was kinda a creole style dipping sauce. It tasted like old bay seasoning in mayo & didn't care for it. The chicken fingers didn't have much flavor to them, batter used bland- no spice. Didn't care for it at all. Have had better chicken tenders at the local grocery store that are WAY better than these! Don't see what all the \"hype\" is all about with this place? Sadly, it was my first and last experience here. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Bye bye KFC, hello to Cane's!  This place is in a different league - chicken fingers are crisp and delicious, not slimey. And fairly priced at $5.99 combo. I'll be back again"}
{"text":"The place looks great inside. But i always go thu the drive thru. There is usually a long line in the drive thru, but i never had to wait too long. Their workers always seemed very friend, happy, smiled.  I always buy the Caniac because it comes with the most food. Their chicken is freshly cooked, which explains why it's so hot when you first get it. I love that about them, because no one would want food that has been sitting under a heat lamp like other fast food restaurants right?!  As everyone has mentioned before, their fries are the crinkled kind that you can buy at any grocery store. But that doesn't bother me, so...  I'm not a big fan of coleslaw to begin with, so their coleslaw was pretty good here. Nothing i would rave about. I also think they would do great without the coleslaw and switch it for some other type of side food, like mash potatoes & gravy :]  Their toast...omg their toast man! I fell in love with it the first time i tried it. It's this thick cut slice, toasty on the outside so that it has that nice crunch to it, but soft in the inside. I always order extra toast when I go here.  Their sauce is one of a kind. Hard to describe, but it taste tangy to me. I like it alot, however i feel like too much of it on my chicken or fries would make me shiver ....yes shiver :P But i love putting the chicken, fries, and their sauce inbetween two toasts, so that its like a sandwich.  Overall: -good service -friendly staff -nice, warm, freshly cooked chicken -ok fries -amazing toast -great one of a kind, tangy type of sauce -ok coleslaw"}
{"text":"Plain Jane Cane's!  I don't think I've ever had such a bland, uninteresting meal. The simple menu could do with something to compliment the otherwise good (not excellent) chicken strips. The signature sauce is simply gross. Yes I have mixed ketchup, mustard and mayo as well, but trying to dress it up with a sort of Mrs. Dash type seasoning, completely failed. Really? A couple of other dipping sauces are going to eat up the profits? The Texas toast was a nice addition, but there ain't a place on planet earth that doesn't at least serve a 3-cent honey packet. Maybe the goal is to be as boring and middle-of-the road as possible. Having said that, the staff was great!"}
{"text":"I first heard of raising canes from a friend who insisted of it being delicious. Menu wise isn't much too choose from but who cares lol it's chicken fingers. Who wouldn't love it lol! Prolly one of the best chicken fingers ever tasted."}
{"text":"Been a while since my last review but had to write some choice words for Cane's not only for their out-of-this-world chicken and sauce but more importantly because of the customer service!   So here's the scenario: just me, the kids and a family friend, all ten and under, at Cane's for a quick bite. I ask the kids to take a seat at a larger, open booth and I proceed to get in line. Lo and behold, I'm the first one up. Score one point already!  I make my order - largely kids meals and my four fingers with a slaw/sauce swap - and the antics proceed. The first order gets wiped out when the register freezes. When the cashier gets it running again, it proceeds to freeze again when I use a gift card with a whopping $2.17 balance that I have on me. It's getting a little crazy, but the kids are keeping each other company in the booth and I'm just chilling with no one behind me.   The cashier calls out her manager whose name escapes me at the moment - female, darker hair and glasses? - who rings me up on another register. When I give her the gift card it reads $0.   Before I could even say anything, she tells me not to worry and that the meal is on her for my \"troubles.\" Keep in mind that I have only been waiting a couple of minutes more than normal and that my gift card would only have purchased a medium cup of that delicious sweet tea. I try to tell her it's ok, but she insists, and my kids, their friends and I proceed to grub on some free Raising Cane's! Needless to say, we were speechless - both because of their level of customer service and the fact that our mouths were filled with that addictive \"chicken-crack\"  ...and I didn't think it could taste any better!  Awesome service guys! And crazy delicious chicken to boot! Just another reason we will always be back to Cane's!"}
{"text":"I love raising canes & after my last visit I love them even more. After a quick trip to Petco with my dog I was starving and we hit the drive through. The cashier asked me if my dog would like a treat and I said of course he does they have me a wrapped milk bone which was so sweet the only other place that acknowledges my dog is Starbucks and I love having options for him to feel included. The staff is always so friendly and so nice and the food is amazing. I'm obsessed with their sweet tea the best sweet tea sweet of the south!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this establishment.  The staff was friendly and the food came out fresh and quick.  I like the food here better than \"Rock-n-Roll Fingers\" here in Tempe.  The chicken fingers, fries, and garlic bread tasted really good.  Also, this place even has a drive-thru which is nice."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend...and they were right.  The chicken strips, fried, coleslaw and,biscuit were AMAZING. Loves their sauce.  They give you so much food.  Looking forward to going again soon!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good spot for something quick. The chicken fingers are crispy, the fries could be a crispier consistency. Some of the fries are and some of the fries aren't crispy. Maybe they weren't cooked through out? I love the canes sauce. It compliments the chicken fingers, toast, and fries well. The Lemonade here is tasty."}
{"text":"I tried this place on recommendation of my cousin. Don't get me wrong, I completely understand why people like this place. I especially appreciate this place as a former Louisiana lady.  However, I was underwhelmed. They only serve baskets of fried chicken strips, fries, coleslaw, Texas toast, and their special sauce... Items are also offered a la cart. The chicken was good, not over fried, and tasted well like a chicken strip. What others may like about these chicken strips is that there is not a lot of breading. A+ on this! The fries were okay and sadly no competition with McDonalds. The toast was good but so soaked it butter with salt I couldn't enjoy more than half of it. The coleslaw was okay and the SAUCE was well just okay. I see why others might like it. It has a strong pepper taste with a mix of whatever else (likely ketchup, mayo, and spices) but was a bit too much to have to whole meal. I really wish this place offered more options, especially in terms of sauces."}
{"text":"I received a gift card, so I went again--been several months.  I remember why I didn't go back.  The staff and service were excellent--this is NOT about the employees.  I ordered The Caniac Combo.  First, the french fries are like those Ore-Ida Golden Crinkles French Fried Potatoes you bake at home.  Not much flavor and they go limp with all the moisture in the to-go container; the worst.  Second, the chicken tenders are too thick and the breading has no flavor; it's edible, but I've had better tasting chicken tenders from Fry's grocery store.  The sauce is terrible--it's like they mixed tartar sauce with some barbecue and mayonnaise.  I'll never be back.  It's like Val Vista & Williams Field is a retail food corner with lameness oozing from underneath.  First, the Burger King that we never went to (been here almost 15 years), and now this.  At least Bush's chicken down the street has better sauces.  But if you want good chicken & fast, stick with Chik-fil-a.  I have no idea why these RC's keep going up all over the place--nothing special!"}
{"text":"Went here today to see what the rave was about! Staff at the counter was friendly there was a few people in line so another cashier jumped up to help us. We took it to go, came out surprisingly fast and we were offered ketchup for fries and a drink holder which was nice since we had several meals. When we got to our destination food was still hot to touch which was nice, since Togo sometimes compromises the food quality! I must say they delivered, the famous sauce didn't disappoint and I even won a piece of Texas toast off my cup, not that I need another reason to eat another piece ! Lol  I will be back for sure !"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!! I've heard so many good reviews about this place from watching mukbangs on YouTube lol. My bf and I decided to give this place a try since it's  less than a mile away from our hotel and we don't have one in NorCal. I got the box combo and my bf got the caniac combo. Although the food was amazing, the caniac combo is more than enough for 2 to share (this is coming from 2 ppl with big appetites!). Chicken tenders were crisp on the outside, moist in the inside. Crinkle cut fries are always a win in my book and coke slaw was meh. My bf and I could both agree that the Canes sauce was amazing and addictive. The sweet tea was a bit too sweet so I filled half of it w/ sweet tea and the rest with unsweetened tea, which was perfect! Definitely recommend trying it at least once while in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and ordered a few things. When I got home they were missing a caniac order. Went all the way back and they treated me like I was lying. I have a lot of money, and drive a nice car, I don't give a damn about ripping you off for 8 dollars LOL. Blonde \"manager\" young girl gave the worst service. If I wasn't hungry, I would've slapped that bimbo. In the end, I forced them to remake my whole order (I did eat some of the first order suckers), and got drinks. Bunch of idiot teenager kids that work there and run the place. Too bad."}
{"text":"Worst drive thru .. so ordered a kids meal with an extra piece but I ordered another 2 extra piece shut I requested to have that extra piece inside the kids meal since it's not mine and but fucking girl or whatever she is in the window told me they can't move it coz they aren't allowed to touch the food like wtf .. its not even hard to do it wash your hands and grab a fucking gloves .. like i work for food industry and this shit never been a problem I ask the first window says it's OK just change the container wtf is wrong with the second window .. never gunna come back here i love canes but this place is shitty ass service just i am just at the drive thru smh .."}
{"text":"Great fast food with an awesome staff. Super busy but the cleanest dining room I have ever seen with crowds like that."}
{"text":"I have been to Raising Cane's in Monterey this is the first time we decided to go to the one in Gilbert. Worst mistake order was wrong. called  ask for the manager Steve of course he's tied up so I had to talk to the other manager she was no help the food is great but make sure you check your order before you leave cuz after that's done God can only help you terrible terrible as far as getting your order right"}
{"text":"Service here is incredible.  The nicest staff. They even put Chick'fil'a to share.  Their sauce and bread is so good.  Great little chicken joint."}
{"text":"This is our favorite location of Raising Canes! Their food is always fresh and delicious and we never have to wait very long for our food! They were training new employees the last time we visited and were doing a great job, we didn't have to wait longer or feel that awkwardness that you usually do when places are training! Love that they have the good ice and the best sweet tea on this side of the country! We love the Canes sauce and the French fries! We also love that the caniac combo is enough to share with your friend! This is our favorite place in Vegas and we are so glad that this location is close to our house! We visit at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. Chill place to take my son and eat some good food. I never liked fried chicken sort of food ever before trying Canes. I now go here like once a week. The chicken is always juicy and the sauce..the sauce is so good. I could eat buckets of that sauce. The fries are great and the to-go ketchup packets are awesome. You can squeeze or dip(it's the little things in life...). I really like the lemonade, but usually wait until the ice melts a bit as it is SUPER sweet. My son loves it though. The garlic bread is on point and melts in my mouth as well. Overall, just love it. It gets really busy sometimes and they close on most all holidays so their employees can have time off. Sign up for their rewards program and you will get emails for free boxes."}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience here. There was a new employee a little blonde girl who had the most amazing attitude. She was the sweetest and was just so nice. I'm not really a big fan of chicken but this place is decent."}
{"text":"I liked the chicken tenders. The Canes sauce is good. Loved the Texas toast. The unsweetened Tea was a good flavor. I will go back. My only wish is the had a few different sides."}
{"text":"Went to this location for the first time yesterday. Not disappointed! Super fast on the wait time, very polite, and the employees were constantly around making sure the other tables were clean. I hadn't had fix in awhile and it was so good! Love the sauce! Always have to get an extra. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great chicken fingers! Love the sauce, bread, and fries. The lemonade is really good too. I think this place is way better than chick fil a! Plus it's open late if you get those late night cravings!"}
{"text":"I love raising Cane's and the food is always excellent and the service is usually good. Except this one, worst service of all the Vegas Raising Cane's. The girl at the register was more interested in trying to help her friend fill out an application than listen to my order. People at the counter just talking while all the empty tables were dirty or had garbage on table. Too bad, I hope this one gets an overhaul soon because I will just keep taking tourists to the store on LVB by the outlet or to In-N-Out instead."}
{"text":"I love raising Cane's and they are all really good. The service is the only thing that varies a lot. This one is on the soso range since the kids that are working were more worried about rapping back my order instead of getting it right. But its all good the food is still unreal and you cant go wrong here."}
{"text":"Nothing is more perfect than Raising Cane's and this is my favorite one in Las Vegas with the best service. The Perfect Chicken strip thick and juicy, the unreal sauce, toast and great fries. But you cannot forget the sweeeet tea!! So unreal! This meal is easily in my top 5 and maybe even a death row request!"}
{"text":"Chicken strips and fries made fresh, served HOT, and with their signature Cane's sauce. It's all done right but it all tastes somewhat mediocre. If only they would season the batter and breading more, have regular fries instead of crinkle-cut, and offer another sauce option it would be a thousand times better.   Their sweet tea is much better than McDonald's."}
{"text":"If you're looking for chicken wings, you're at the wrong place, read the name of the restaurant...it's literally just that.  Checked out Raising Cane's one night, came in around 10:55pm.  We ordered our food to eat for here but the cashier asked the manager if we could still eat there since they close at 11pm but  the manager said we could stay as long as we wanted, pretty much since their drive thru is open till 1am.  Very cool dude, appreciated the great attitude and customer service from a fast food joint for once.  Actually, they cashier and the other staff we encountered were way friendly and cool.  The Chicken Fingers were alright, can't say they were outstanding or anything.  The CF from KFC probably have a little more flavor but that's just me.  The CF came with one kind of sauce.  Couldn't figure out exactly what the flavor was, it was kind of like a cross between Thousand Island dressing and the sauce from Chick-Fil-A.  It was good but, I would've rather had Honey Mustard or BBQ.  The rest of the food...the Fries, Texas Toast and Slaw were pretty basic.  I did however love how they offered Sweet Tea in their beverage selection."}
{"text":"This Cane's location is near many other good fast-food restaurants so if they are crazy busy, as Cane's gets sometimes, a very short walk or drive will get you to a reasonable alternative.   Raising Cane's pretty much does only one entree item: chicken fingers.  Granted, they have a sandwich but it is just their chicken fingers inside a bun.  Given that they only do ONE entree, it should be good, right?  Well, mostly it's good as long as you don't eat it too often.    The chicken fingers are usually moist and tender but when they are tough and dry (for whatever reason), they are awful.  Unfortunately, this was most the case in my last visit.  Their fries are crinkle-cut and just plain great.  If only they offered other entree items so I could enjoy their fries with a burger or non-chicken-finger sandwich.  The cole slaw is forgettable to me, but I'm not a cole slaw eater to begin with.  Even those who like cole slaw don't like it when the container is overpacked and bursts open when you touch the lid (not an unusual occurrence at any Cane's).  The Texas toast is ok but (of course) bready and really needs to be dipped in their Cane's sauce to be fully edible.  Fortunately, you are welcome to swap the toast for extra sauce or extra cole slaw.  Service always seems to be good and cheerful at every Raising Cane's I've been to.  Perhaps they add a secret ingredient to their chicken to make their employees so cheerful, or perhaps they just love serving chicken fingers.  Whatever the reason, I've yet to encounter an unpleasant Raising Cane's employee here or at any other location.  Parking seems to be okay but I've only arrived at off hours."}
{"text":"Out of the way by my usual Vegas visit standards but close to my favorite Vegas popcorn shop.  Has the usual Raising Cane's food (a good or bad thing depending on how you feel about their chicken wings and crinkle cut fries) with friendly staff and seemingly decent parking."}
{"text":"When in the mood for chicken strips, can't beat Raising Cane's.  Not that the craving comes all that often.  In comparison, Church's isn't as tasty and Popeye's isn't as tender and juicy.  Oh, and they have good, crisp, crinkle-cut fries that are among the best I've had.  This location is on the outskirts of the La Vegas Premium Outlets so if there is no parking right in front, park on the outlet side, where there should be lots of space."}
{"text":"The fatboy inside me makes me come here. That dipping sauce is addictive as well."}
{"text":"Finally opened up in my neighborhood, SUMMERLIN! You can't complain about Canes. They are just good. No need to say anything. Consistent quality of food. This location is better than any other locations in Vegas. It's clean and the servers are all nice. I was carrying 3 boxes and 3 drinks and one server offered to help. Such a nice girl.   This location just opened up, so there are so many people on drive thru line. So if the drive thru line is backed up all the way down to the gas station, just walk in and get your orders to go. It's faster than staying in the line for drive thru!"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant in yelp.  We ordered the combo \"a box\" in which the portion is large enough for two.  People mentioned on yelp that this restaurant is from Louisiana and it's because the rating is pretty high so we just gave it a try.  They didn't disappoint us.  I like everything in the combo; the fries, the chicken finger and the toasted bread.  It's near South Point so if next time I live there again I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Just had this for a late dinner tonight, their sauce is to die for and I wish I could buy it by the gallon!! So incredibly yummy, restaurant is always packed (which is a good sign!!) and the staff was super friendly!"}
{"text":"When canes showed up a few yrs ago around here, I thought how dumb. I can get chicken fingers any where. Well my kids and the wife love it, so I got overruled to where we would go eat. So to me I still can get chicken fingers anywhere...same style to, but not at the same price. I like the price! Oh, did I forget the Holy Grail?! The sauce... And now I like Cane's, but don't tell my kids I said so. Oh yeah, the bread is nice too..."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what all the hype was, but totally get it now!! Best chicken strips I've ever had!! Sauce they give you is amazing and I see why they charge extra for it. Service was friendly. Can't wait to come back! So good!! A definite must try while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Now don't get me wrong I absolutely LOVE Canes! However, I just had the worst food experience ever! My fries and chicken were old, very old and cold. The toast was saggy and limp. I'm new this Decatur location as I just moved and I was completely disappointed.  It maybe worth the 13 mile round trip ride just to get good Canes. I will not be visiting the Decatur location again, not even with someone else's money!"}
{"text":"We have wanted to try this place after driving past it for the past couple years as the drive thru is always packed.  I was disappointed in the small selection of meals...mainly unflavored tiny fried chicken strips with some frozen crinkle fries and a piece of bread...oh and some bland coleslaw and a not so very special sauce.  Hardly what I would consider a decent meal much less pay for it and actually feel there is a need to actually have an establishment devoted specifically to this type of food.  I mean, why develop an entire menu of meals where the main difference is the quantity of strips and sides??? The bf thought it was okay but he had to order the large meal and also ate half of mine.  The cashier was nice enough, but had either a hearing problem or attention deficit disorder...she had my drink order wrong twice...diet soda, no ice...not sweet tea with ice or diet soda with ice.  I do not understand the hype at all especially when there are so many other places to choose from."}
{"text":"Yup - a chicken finger specialty place.  Shall I have chicken fingers or chicken fingers?  Pretty good stuff.  If you are nearby and like chicken fingers just a bit, you gotta go for it."}
{"text":"The south sure knows how to fry up some good chicken and carb load you to the max and I love it!  Decent pricing, good food and tons of seating in a clean place. This place is always busy and packed, even with a drive through.  Honestly, I've never heard of Raising Cane's and was brought here by some classmates. I got the Three Tenders and a Sweet Tea to drink. The tenders were juicy on the inside and had a great crisp, seasoned crust and you can also tell they're freshly made by how hot they are when they are served. The meal comes with krinkle-cut fries and a slice of Texas Toast which is crisp on one side and fluffy on the inside. Their signature sauce is creamy with a hint of smoke and tang. It tastes great with anything dipped into it. Also, I made sure to refill my sweet tea because it is so good!  Definitely a great place for chicken tenders and fries, it's simple and done well!"}
{"text":"I admit I was skeptical about a place that only serves  chicken fingers. How good can they be, right?  OMG!  They are awesome. They only use the tenderloin so they are very tender and juicy. The batter is light and the sauce is awesome too. The sweet tea and the Texas toast are a plus. I'm going to make sure I go to Raising Cane's whenever I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Yummy chicken strips and tasty sauce. Oh and the Sweet Tea is the best I've had on the West Coast.  If you like ice, they have the little crunchy cubes ;). We got the 6 pc strip meal, it came with a drink, Texas toast, fries and two sauces of your choosing. They specialize in strips so you'll find no burgers at this joint, the menu keeps it short and sweet."}
{"text":"First time to a raising canes,  It's pretty simply and easy to order. They only serve chicken fingers and  about 3 sides. Now Best thing about this place is their customer service they greet as you walk into the door and thank you when you're leaving. Being that said. The food is just fine. Can't say nothing negative about this place."}
{"text":"First time at raising canes and I'm quite impressed! I requested extra crispy chicken and fries, and a cup of lemonade. Everything was really tasty! Tables were clean, service was normal, and food was nice and hot."}
{"text":"I love this canes, it's the closest one to me. Anytime I feel like I need some good ole Cane Sauce and Texas toast this is the place to go. Oh how I love the chicken here. The sweet tea is also great when I'm feelin a little ache in my sweet tooth (maybe I just need to go to the dentist). The fries are also very good! Dip them in Canes sauce and honey mustard for an even better taste!"}
{"text":"Love the batter on the chicken fingers. Delicious.  Awesome service from the worker that took our order here. I appreciate that this morning!!!  Not overrated.  Got the 4 piece.    They need one down here in the 562 area code. The nearest one to me is in Downey, CA.    I heard there's gonna be one nearby Lakewood Center Mall in Lakewood, CA soon....hopefully!!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try the hype about CHICKEN TENDERS! I've heard so many great things about Cane's and finally got the chance to stop by and try it in Vegas. I shared the Caniac Combo which comes with 6 tenders, coleslaw, Texas toast, fries, cane's famous sauce, and a large drink. The chicken was delicious and reminded me of the juicy chick fil a chicken! The cane's sauce bursts with flavors of different spices. The soft Texas toast has a nice buttery taste and the cold coleslaw with the hot fries matches well with each other. I know this is a lot to say for a fast food chain, but I have never been to Raising Cane's and it definitely rose to my expectations!"}
{"text":"Oh Canes.... So I have lived across the street for 9 months and have tried so hard not to cave! Ah where do I start.... The chicken...? The sauce...? Everything was perfect. I got my large sweet tea and my 3 finger combo which was absolutely perfection. The drive thru was surprisingly quick and painless as opposed to the other canes in town! I will be back ;)"}
{"text":"I rarely eat fast food, but I like this a lot.   I love chicken fingers at bars, but skip out on fast food ones...it just doesnt taste of love, usually pre-made and has too much breading that gets too hard after frying and sitting in a heater box. Blah.   I like that here its fresh- cooked to order and crispy, but not too heavy batter.I wish though they had some side options. I love chicken fingers and potato salad, but coleslaw, fries and toast with special sauce is good too...just sometimes I want to mix it up. Portions are pretty big. My BF and I usually get the 6 finger box (add 2 more fingers for us and our dog and cat go apeshit for this as soon as they smell it at the door so we keep extras for them to share) and it's plenty of food to fill us up.   Sweet tea! I know its a pound of sugar in each batch but I love it.  Best of all, open late! I dont have many fast food late options near home and this is one of the tastier, fresher fast foods out there."}
{"text":"DUDE!!!!!!!  I grew up in the South so as such I have become like a fried chicken connoisseur and I must say that Raising Cane's is the first and last stop in vegas for awesome fried chicken.  The chicken is always juicy, the breading is simply perfect.  It doesn't have they frozen, institutional taste to it like you get at a Popeye's or KFC.  The Cane's Sauce I'm pretty sure has crack in it as I can't stop eating and most likely have woken up in cold sweets in the middle of the night craving Cane's sauce (ok ok just kidding but it is darn good).  Go here, seriously, or you hate happiness, puppy dogs, and rainbows."}
{"text":"I like Cane's but at least every other visit at this location, they give you fries that are soggy, wet, and frankly don't look appetizing at all. Not sure we'll be going there anymore for that reason alone. Chick-Fil-A never has that issue."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for chicken fingers, Cane's is the place to go for a quick and awesome meal!  Me and my husband usually get the Caniac to share.  Its typically just the right amount of food for us.  Comes with 6 fingers, fries, two pieces of toast, coleslaw, and a drink.  6 fingers might not seem like much to split between two people, but with the sides, it makes for a pretty fulfilling meal for two people.    The fingers are always tender and juicy.  It has the perfect amount of breading and is never really greasy.  Their fries are nothing just fries and the coleslaw is just coleslaw.  Their texas toast is definitely something to mention.  It's awesome.  Its toasted so perfects!  I like to take a little bit of the toast, wrap it around a piece of the chicken, and dip is in the sauce.  The sauce is one of their biggest selling points here.  It's like a spicy mayo peppery sauce.  Goes hand in hand with the chicken fingers IMO!  My suggestion would be to eat there.  The food tastes much better fresh and doesn't get soggy like it would if you took it home.  Plus, refills on the delicious sweet tea!"}
{"text":"The people at the register were friendly, now onto my review.  I thought I would try this place since it is one of the new places to eat around work. I ordered \"The BOX\" and got it to go. I was surprised just how long it took to get my food despite there being maybe 5 or 6 people sitting down at the tables and nobody else in line. I asked if they had other dipping sauces since special sauces are always disappointing, and they don't have any. Seriously? Not even BBQ? You specialize in chicken fingers and don't have BBQ? Ok fine, I'll try your sauce. It was terrible, I ate an entire finger using it hoping that it would get better, it didn't. I had to go find some hot sauce here at work since the chicken itself was so bland.  Chicken - Not bad texture wise, but bland.  Sauce - Terrible. Get more sauces, the one you tout as the best doesn't have the ability to stand on its own. Asking others in the office its either a love it/hate it verdict, which essentially means those who hate it won't be repeat customers.  Fries - Did you get these from Fry's across the street? Crinkle cut bland fries, yeah that sounds like store bought.  Texas Toast - Great  Coleslaw - Never been a fan, so no review here.   Apparently this place stays in business by those who actually like the sauce since everything else they serve is underwhelming."}
{"text":"I'm new to Vegas and since finding this place I've been in love. They NEVER disappoint. Tonight was my first time going through drive thru and I ordered my usually Caniac combo with no coleslaw & 2 extra sauces. I didn't think to check the box cause they always provide but when I got home- there's only a handful of fries in my box, and I have no sauces! I'm not going to drive back right now for my two sauces but when I come back tomorrow I will let them know and show them my receipt that I paid for it. Also my coke was an inch below the top- small things but I'm disappointed compared to how satisfied I usually am"}
{"text":"The service was excellent last night!!  They were very friendly!!  I have only been there a few times since they opened due to the long drive thru line.  I walked inside and ordered it to go.  It was super fast!!  And I was amazed at how super sweet they were!!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"My dog is making me write this review.  Always great food and fabulous service. Ruby (my dog) and I went through the drive thru today.  Ruby says to tell you how nice Claudia was. And that she loved the treat. Ruby loves when someone tells her she's pretty. Both ladies at both windows spoke to her. She loves Canes best after today and getting a treat!"}
{"text":"I only give this place a 5 star rating because the food is literally TO DIE FOR!!!! This location is almost always busy because it is a college town and the food is cheap, easy, and fast. There is basically four options on the menu so you really can't mess up which is super nice. The staff is always so kind despite the long lines of annoying college kids (yes I am one of them). There is nothing like this place and if you are in town, it is a must try!!"}
{"text":"It would never occur to me to order chicken fingers under any circumstance, but my wife practically lives on them.  So, a couple of years ago, we discovered Raising Cane's, and we do not EVER leave Vegas without stopping at the one near the Las Vegas Outlet Mall a couple of miles south of Mandalay Bay.  They basically serve chicken fingers and a chicken sandwhich with sides such as crinkle-cut fries, cole-slaw (better than KFC), and their Texas Toast for which I would make the drive to Vegas anytime.  The dipping sauce is what, for me, makes it great.  It is some kind of spicy cajun concoction.  The chicken fingers literally fall apart in your hands they are so tender.  Anyone want to become rich instantly?? Open one of these bad boy's in Orange County!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Arizona and this isn't something that we have in Northern California. But the first time I went here I was hooked. It is absolutely delicious. It's the In n Out of chicken places.  The butter friend bread, the chicken strips, the fries. There is absolutely no way to go wrong here."}
{"text":"One of the best Canes to visit! Besides the delicious chicken, the staff and management are very kind and courteous. The restaurant is very clean and usually gets a little packed. Everytime I come through the drive through it's a breeze. The staff there is very efficient and making the drive through the best option when you're in a rush. I definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Typical raising canes, efficient and good food"}
{"text":"Wow that's some damn fine bird yo!  Did the drive thru at 5pm and the line was all the way around the building.  No problem!  Limited menu means the line flows quickly.  Three Cariacs were enough for the four of us.  The chicken is great.  The slaw, fries and Texas Toast are even better, and the secret sauce is crazy good and goes on everything including Pizza or Pancakes :-)"}
{"text":"Nothing crazy out of the ordinary here. You get some chicken strips that taste like any other chicken strip you can get anywhere (not worse nor better). The fries are crinkle fries, kind of like the ones you get at del taco (i like del taco's better actually). I liked the cajun dipping sauce that came with them it was almost like a cajun ranch, the bread was also really good. As first timers we asked the clerk about what she would recommend and she was amazingly nice. She was patient and helpful in our decision, she also had a big smile on the whole time. Just because I wasn't wowed by this establishment (i like chik-fil-a better), I probably won't be returning but if it's the only thing around I wouldn't discourage it."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here.  We ordered what everyone else orders, chicken fingers and coleslaw.  The service was really good, she was very informative too about the history of the company as we were reading their board in the lobby about how the company got created.  Food was fresh, hot and served quick.  HOWEVER.  I absolutely didn't see the hype in this place.  The chicken fingers were soft/tender which I love, but NO flavor.  Definitely lack of seasoning!  and SMALL!!!  So due to the size, they are OVER PRICED!  I did like the sauce but all in all who cares about the sauce if the main item isn't worth the price and lacks flavor.  I definitely have to say that the chicken fingers at Carl's Jr (although they are a bit pricey too) are the best around!   I would not come back to Raising Cane's at all, I wasn't impressed by any means. I'd easily give 2 stars but the 3rd star is for service, knowledge of the employee and food was hot/fresh however small, bland and over priced.  Thanks but this place wasn't for me. Definitely over hyped!"}
{"text":"For only having a few items, they are always crazy packed. Food is pretty good and service is always fast"}
{"text":"This new establishment opened about 1 week ago. This is located on St. rose parkway near St. Rose hospital sienna campus right next to the Tommy's burger place you can't miss it.   For someone who is really hungry order the caniac! it comes with 6 pieces of chicken fingers, coleslaw , fries , a piece of bread with two special caniac sauce and a drink all for $8.59. Bam! What a deal! Oh yeah they will charge you 29 cents for honey mustard sauce be aware. Grrrr! I'm a stinking Asian every penny counts for us joke!!:)  Fast food establishments aren't my usual cup of tea. But I made an exception with this place. Customer service was great you were pleasantly greeted, the drive through had a long line but they managed to get everyone out if there within 10 minutes. I really enjoyed my food. The thing I like about their chicken fingers is they use lean white meat and the breading was great! Can't go wrong if your on the run and looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"this is not matt this is stee bon by the way, the f'n disco ball wasnt spinning tonight and im pissed! straight up im not happy. 2 stars"}
{"text":"I love this place, I've found the drive thru to be a slow and not efficient for a quick stop. Their canes sauce is AMAZING. I wish they could give extra sauce at no additional price and have other condiments available."}
{"text":"While heading back to our hotel we were looking for something to eat, my gal friend saw Canes and insisted we stop here since they had one of these back in Texas. I wasn't expecting much since the place only serves chicken strips, but they were actually pretty good, the fries were fine, & the Texas toast was pretty much a soft piece of bread.  The thing that sold me the most was whatever their sauce is. I'm usually a BBQ sauce or nothing person when it comes to chicken strips so when I found out they don't have any other dipping sauce I was kind of annoyed at first, then I decided to actually try something different for once and I'm glad that I did. Then chicken strips aren't life changing amazing, but they are really good, the real thing that makes the food here good is the dipping sauce that I didn't bother asking the name of."}
{"text":"The Food is Fast and Fresh,cooked to order so its Super hot when you get in.So give it a minute or two before U dig in.Also check ur email for specials on your Raising Cane's card, this location is great honoring them.Also they fast and open up more registers if there R too many people in line.Overall a great great place for either dinner, or Lunch-the food consistently tastes great and very filling.Keep up the good Job Flamingo office!"}
{"text":"Good thing the chicken is good.  I had to wait 20 minutes in the drive thru.  Sad for lunch.  I don't plan to return for lunch unless there is no line"}
{"text":"yummy!! I've been told its like the In-n-out equivalent with chicken strips. The wait here is just as long. but not to order. I guess since it takes longer to cook chicken.  Gotta love that sauce though.  Its like crack! Its my go to place for lunch if I can't decide where to go."}
{"text":"After a long journey up Interstate 15, we arrived to the welcoming, bright lights of the Strip.  The first thing we needed to do was kill the hunger from the long road trip.  Someone suggested Raising Canes and promised we wouldn't be disappointed.  He was correct.  Tasty chicken fingers and the bread was good too.  The best sweet tea since I was in North Carolina.  Five days later, we had to return to this place before our journey home."}
{"text":"Toooasstttttt.....  Drive up to the drive-thru like what up I want a chicken box.  With some extra toast. Toooasstt!  Here I was all excited, about the toast and all, and I pull up to the first window to pay and the cashier Sarah (I'm assuming it's Sarah cause, surprise, they put the name on the receipts) is snotty towards me. Ugh, what did I do to you chick, I just wanted some extra toast! She goes to hand me back my card without saying a word to me, but see's a coworker/friend on the other side of the parking lot and feels the need to shout REALLY LOUD to him, like \"bye\"or some shit. So in the mist of that she drops my card and just turns around to close the window. UH OK. Maybe if you didn't have those hideously obvious, fakeass colored-contact lenses in, you'd be able to see what the fuck you were doing and not drop my shit without so much an apology. You asshat.  Got to the other window, got my delicious food with my fucking extra toast that I fucking really wanted and was like fuck yes, and drove off.   Food wise, the chicken is good but if you're looking for a crispy country-fried version, this definitely ain't it, and the toast is obviously the best thing on the planet. The only thing I hate about this place is the french fries. They're those little wiggly, scrunchie shaped ones that remind me of the frozen shit they served in my elementary cafeteria. Blek. Toast is the best though for sure, and the only reason I even bother coming to this place.  You know I fucking love the toast if I'm dealing with little shithead teens to get it. YOOOOooooo"}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 92/100***  Always fresh, never frozen! I'm a big fan of this chain. The only downside for me is this particular location tends to get really busy during lunch time and drive thru orders can take extra long, sucks when you only have 30 minute lunches. Besides that, everything is great!  I usually get the Caniac combo which comes with 6 pieces of delicious, hot and perfectly breaded chicken tenders. Fries, Texas toast, coleslaw and 2 Cane's sauce which I assume is what crack would taste like, soooo addicting! It's plenty of food but I like to share. Also worth mentioning is their Sweet tea. Staff is always nice and apologetic when wait times tend to be longer."}
{"text":"Memo to self-Raising Cane's is consistent across locations.  Paste in review of location on S. Las Vegas Blvd. here:  wtf?  Where is my review of the one on S. Las Vegas Blvd. from like 2 years ago?!    It went something like this:  Do one thing and do it well.  Some chains take this approach and do well with it.  In & Out for example.  Raising Cane's does the same with chicken fingers.  Great chicken fingers.  Fries.  Texas toast.  That's it.  But they do it really well.  Well enough that if I'm in a hurry for lunch (fast food time) I will choose Raising Cane's over the McWendyKing's of the world every time."}
{"text":"This is the greatest fast food restaurant in the world. Maria and Jared at the front were fast and friendly, the food was top shelf as always, and the manager was nice and knowledgeable. Try your Texas Toast \"buttered on both sides\" (BOBS) and make sure to get extra Cane's sauce. You're welcome."}
{"text":"BO-RING!  I don't get the Raising Cane's love.  I don't.  I used to go to Raising Cane's when I lived in Texas and I've been a few times here when I'm sick of everything else.  I could make better fries in my oven.  The chicken is okay, but I'm not blown away.  I HATE the Cane's sauce.  HATE.  I wish they at least offered BBQ.  If I know I'm gonna have to eat here because my fiancé has a hankerin' for some mediocre chicken strips, I always bring a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's in my purse.  Some people around us (and the workers) usually laugh or make fun, but by the end of our time dining there, a few people also ask for a squirt of the good stuff.    Plus one star for excellent iced tea."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken joint in town! They specialize in fried chicken. Their menu is narrow, but the are great at those items: fried chicken, fries, toast and coleslaw.   They have a loyalty program that gets you some free food, but not often. You can get a free finger if the Cardinals win!"}
{"text":"Actually, I give this 4.5, of course, round half up plus infinity rule makes that 5 stars.  The half star comes off due to the Texas toast being too healthy, as in not covered in a garlic butter cheese and oil topping in order to more effectively clog my so-called \"arteries\", are those really important?    Interesting fact: Raising Cane's is based out in Louisiana, and part of the capital raised to start the business came from salmon fishing in Alaska.  Pretty cool, huh? On to the food!  Chicken fingers are pretty much the bulk of the menu, and they are really REALLY good!  And the batter isn't as heavy as other chicken fingers, so they don't feel all greasy when you pick them up.  And the sauce they come with?  Some kind of tangy mayo based dip that made it different than eating fingers with the usual honey mustard, BBQ or ranch, although I think you can get honey mustard at certain locations.    I split the Caniac combo with my wife, which allowed us to have 3 fingers each, I got both sauce cups(my wife tasted the sauce but I ate most of it) and the cole slaw, split the toast and the fries and shared a large drink. Liked that the cole slaw wasn't oniony. The fries were standard crinkle cut, but they taste pretty good with the sauce!   Raising Cane's has inspired me to find the best chicken fingers in the metropolitan Chicago area.  Fortunately I live nowhere near this place, otherwise I would probably gorge on a Caniac by myself every day that ends in -y."}
{"text":"This is my must have every time before I leave vegas! The chicken is so tender with just the right coating of crisp of breading. The Texas toast that comes with it is so flavorful. You can taste the butter and the right amount of crisp to it. The large amount of fries that come with it. Not to mention the \"crack sauce\" as I call it that comes as dipping sauce for the chicken fingers is amazingly good!  The staff was nice, friendly and fast. Our order was taken right away and we got our order within seriously a minute!  on the side note: -plenty of parking space -restroom is clean! (smells good)"}
{"text":"I like this Caine's better than the Centennial one l. The food was really good and the servers were really nice."}
{"text":"Sadly, this isn't the first time this has happened to me at a Raising Cane's. I was hoping it was just the location I went to prior but now it seems it's a chain problem. We ordered a couple Box Combos from Drive Thru and when we got home after eating some of the food, I broke one of the chickens apart and found a 4 inch Black/Silver hair stuck inside of the breading of the chicken  I'm not sure what has happened to the quality of Raising Cane's but it seems that as they have grown, the quality has become less focal. At this point, I don't care to go to another Raising Cane's bc it's happened at multiple locations and I feel as if it's possible to happen at any of them. Take a look at the photos I've put with the review, and see what I am talking about."}
{"text":"This is the 1st time I had Cane's. So what's the big deal?? Hmmm..because I don't see it. They're OK, definitely had better chicken strips else where. I do have to say that I am picky with cole slaws and I've only ever like two different ones my whole life-now it's three lol. #sorrynotsorry   I was actually a bit disappointed. Since everyone always made a big deal :/"}
{"text":"Canes is amazing, it's so amazing that it's alway's packed.  On my last trip, i asked the counter helper if they had desert; she answered \" Chicken? \". I twas awesome."}

{"text":"Chicken strips!  Heard a lot of people rave about this place, so I had to give it a try when I came to Vegas, and it was pretty good. This location was pretty busy since it was near the outlets so it was a struggle to try to find parking, but finally got in, the service was pretty fast. The menu had some pretty good combo deals I went with chicken strips, fries, and toast deal and it was pretty good. The chicken strip was flavorful, the fries weren't too salty, the bread was my favorite part of the meal, yummy! Also the canes sauce really is crack, make sure to put it on everything, yum!  Overall, for a fast food joint, this place isn't too shabby; for a quick tasty bite in Vegas, id be back here for some chicken strips and toast :)   Happy eats, loves! ^_^"}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     53/100  First time going to a Raising Cane's (about 2 weeks ago). I know, right?! What took me so long? haha. We went through the drive thru.The friends I was with are huge Raising Cane's fans. First time I had their chicken tenders was at a friend's party, they ordered a whole pan of chicken tenders.   I ordered one of the meals. Chicken tenders, texas toast, and fries.   I really liked it. The chicken tenders had a good amount of batter and crisp. The toast was soft on the inside, would've preferred it grilled longer, I like my toast to have more crisp when grilled. The fries and Cane's sauce were tasty as well.

{"text":"I've been coming to Vegas for just over a year and everyone says yah gotta stop here.   I'm sorry, but it's chicken fingers/strips.    They were good, but really? Chicken strips?    Customer service was amazing and the dipping sauce was like \"fry sauce\" only better :-)  I'd stop here instead of another chicken place (except Popeyes) or fast food in a heart beat...but won't make it a goal.   Sorry guys. Not a nut for chicken strips. No matter how good....and these are just that...good.   Side note. Coleslaw is acceptable but the kernel has better...the fries are limp and lifeless, Texas toast warm and tasty."}
{"text":"This location just opened today close to home and I hit their grand opening for a free box combo and also happened to be a lucky recipient of a much larger coveted prize (goodbye waistline, hello chicken from now til next spring-that's right, free cane's for a year).   The festivity itself was a hit as they really pulled out all the stops for this grand opening...the who's who within the organization showed up along with a professional and friendly cane's crew (the warm faces in fast food commercials that you think don't exist in real life secretly work for Cane's) as well as the Mayor, Mrs. Goodman, and a radio station for promotion. It was cool learning how much this place gives back to the community in a speech given prior to the ribbon cutting ceremony. They do a lot for local children in need with their make a wish foundation and seem to treat their employees like family. It's no wonder they have a reputation that reaches beyond their outstanding food.  As for the food...I've long been a fan of the Cane's franchise...you simply can't beat the quality of the chicken they use, the oil they fry it in, and of course, their insanely addicting sauce. The combo box of tenders consists of a light golden tan breading that allows the chicken be the star of the show, some fresh crinkle cut fries always cooked in fresh oil (which tastes like it's changed daily) and nothing too heavy handed with the salt, quite my style. Add to it a generous sized piece of \"Texas toast\" and a side of coleslaw and you've got one of the better meals in town to be handed across a drive thru window."}
{"text":"Got the itinerary all set for the next Vegas trip....this place!  The buffets can hold off for a while, the 21 tables will always be there.    But until they expand to the Bay Area, their 4(?) Vegas locations are as close as it gets for their \"Box\" special or 6 piece Caniac combo which could really feed two at one sitting.  The tenders don't sit around, they are always crispy outside and juicy inside.  Throw in homemade slaw (good but a bit soggy), Texas toast (better than Sizzler) and seasoned crinkly fries (better than Del Taco) and it didn't even need their secret sauce but a little didn't hurt it at all.  I try to keep the fast food reviews to a minimum but sometimes you just feel like telling everyone!  Their mascot is a Lab.  More cool points right there."}
{"text":"Chicken is always fresh and hot.  French fries always seem to be soggy but we come here for the chicken tenders so who cares!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and the garlic toast is to die for!!!! A buttery garlicky party in my mouth! Mmmmmm.  The chicken fingers have very light breading. Not greasy at all. And the signature sauce is amazing!!!  Check this place out."}
{"text":"Fucking love this chicken joint! Omfg the chicken is cooked to perfection! The sauce is whuuttttttt!!! And the Texas is toast is fucking killer!!!!!!! Fat kid party but so Yummm!"}
{"text":"Not bad, the decor of the place is great; it looks clean, new and contemporary... I didn't really understand why there's a disco ball in the lobby but what the hell.  It's one of the best fast food chicken fingers intown, the meat was very tender. Fries are good, sause was great, cole slaw was good; however, it's been 30 minutes since my meal and my body feels like it's overdosing on cholesterol...   I'll be back if I don't suddenly die right now."}
{"text":"I'm honestly surprised this Canes has such poor recent reviews, but often only the disgruntled leave these... I checked in and took a pic so you'd know I really went in today!   Been here several times and the experience was always fairly speedy with no problems.  No different today. Walked in, ordered right away, got my food 7min later and it was all good. Very clean inside and bathroom , well lit, safe, tunes and nice temp and I'm super picky about thinking it's too cold!  The young lady cashier was nice and laughed at my jokes although I am pretty funny. Other than a little one (toddler) terrorizing the villagers it was a pleasant experience. Only not 5 stars because that's reserved for truly above and beyond wow experiences."}
{"text":"Had lunch here Saturday and was up all night with food poisoning. Thought I was going to die. Will not be eating here again the rest of my life. Can I guarantee that I got if from here no. But 8 hours after lunch I was dancing around the bathroom. Worst pain I have had in years. Just check to make sure your chicken in done that all I have to say."}
{"text":"Going to college in Tallahassee, the one spot that was a winner for everyone was \"Guthrie's of Tallahassee\"... Same style menu & the staple of a college meal here at Raising Cane's. Even more fitting that it's near ASU Campus. Chicken Fingers, Fries, Texas Toast & coleslaw (swap-able). Granted, it's a chain with locations globally I believe, but it still provides that same level of comfort I had back in school... A simple and great tasting meal!!!  Its a basic concept & they keep it simple. They sell chicken tenders and that's what I like about them. Expanding the menu to do \"too much\" would take away from things, so hopefully they keep it simple. If ur a dipping person like me, order an extra sauce or exchange the coleslaw for another item like toast!"}
{"text":"Great fast food at a good price! The chicken is always fresh and I love the canes sauce."}
{"text":"I had a misunderstanding with their manager but I got a free meal for it, much obliged"}
{"text":"I had heard raves about Raising Cane's chicken fingers.  But I never thought chain restaurant chicken would taste so awesome.    Lightly breaded and the moistest chicken I've ever had.     Raising Cane's is my new go-to chicken finger joint."}
{"text":"RC's always hits the spot.  It's one of the only fast food joints I hit, but it's the \"bossy sauce\" that makes it work!  I doubt I need to describe the food to you, and if you have never been here before, just imagine juicy chicken strips, yummy fries and toast, and a great sauce that goes well with everything.  Not much more to say...it was clean and the service was friendly.  Just come eat lol"}
{"text":"I love cane's but this location needs to get it together. I know it's just dunks, but if I'm paying for something, I address the issue with you and you don't even attempt to fix it then it's very upsetting to me.  We came, ordered our food. For the combo we asked for a caniac combo with an Arnold palmer and another large Arnold palmer (keep in mind they charge extra for that drink). We get out drinks and the lady hands me a regular Arnold palmer and one thy is just lemonade (not even the natural one, they put the Minute Maid one). I told her what was wrong with the order and she brushed it off kind of shrugging and said \"well that's not what it said on the order\"....look at my receipt as we left and it turns out I was right"}
{"text":"My Children and nephew's love it! It is a great place to take the kids! I would recommend it for younger children all the way up to high school students!"}
{"text":"A couple years ago, while I was on one of my first trips to Vegas, my boyfriend decided to take a walk with me to Target. Unfortunately, I no longer had energy and desperately needed food. When I looked to my left I saw a fast-food building called Raising Cane's. Ever since that fateful day, I have been addicted.  Raising Canes has got to be one of my favorite fast food places for chicken! Their chicken fingers are always yummy, and the dipping sauce for them is so good. It adds a kick of flavor to each chicken finger, and tastes great with the fries and texas toast as well! My favorite thing about eating here has to be the texas toast. Please order extra, you will not regret this decision. If you don't care for coleslaw like me, you can ask them to trade it out for another piece of toast! It's so great!   I definitely recommend coming here if you like cheap, but delicious fast food."}
{"text":"Zoey and Tyrus provided exceptional customer service. From the parking lot to the table they even gave us reward cards. Their energy was out the roof! Navarro, attended me at the cashier and was helpful with the menu :) Also, the food was great"}
{"text":"It's chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw and Texas toast. Nothing else. They just take those same things and mix them around a bit. BUT if you think that's a bad thing then you've never been there. It's simple, good, inexpensive food in Vegas. We loved that it was piping hot, fast and served with a smile. No need to study the menu... Want 2, 3, 4 or 6 pieces? Want coleslaw or not? Thats about all the decisions you need to make. We liked it and will probably have more before leaving Sin City."}
{"text":"I occasionally have to scratch my Raising Cane's itch and drive from deep Henderson to this location, as it's the closest to where I live.   This particular location is clean, and the service is excellent. I usually go inside because I've found the drive-thru can back up and take longer than ordering at the counter. The food is always good and consistent.  The menu is simple, but it's all about the chicken tenders and trademark sauce. If you don't like coleslaw, you can substitute more fries, an extra piece of bread, or another sauce.  It can feel tight traversing the skimpy parking lot, but that's of no concern once you're inside munching on one of their signature chicken tenders.   Raising Cane's is definitely one of my fast food guilty pleasures, and this location doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is like any other fast food joint.   They were nice, I like their sweet tea, & their Texan toast is diff. But nothing life changing about this place."}
{"text":"Ok, so after hearing so much about this place & checking the reviews, my family and I finally got a chance to check this place out tonight...The drive thru-line was packed & so was the inside. I thought, this place must be great...We got two boxes of The Caniac which included: Cole slaw, Tx Toast, Fries, & 6 chicken fingers...We also got the Sweet tea...My verdict: Bland, Bland, Bland...Wow...I cannot believe how  season-less this chicken was...Almost like they just threw it in the fryer...We've had better strips at Chili's...Fries: I love crinkle fries but these had no taste whatsoever...The cole slaw was just plain disguisting...Tasted stale. The Sweet tea & Tx Toast was the best thing in the combo...We drove pretty darn far to get to this place & now I'm pissed that I wasted my gas. Kids ate it but only because they were starving. My daughter said it was ehhh ok....Oh, almost forgot about the sauce which people said they couldnt live without. We even bought extras for $.31 cent a piece...Totally not good. Right now, I'm eating these chicken fingers with ketchup and threw a bunch of season on our fries when we got home...Maybe the other locations are better...."}
{"text":"I was sent on the long treck from the speedway to Raising Cane's as a emergency graving fix for my honey. Let me describe my Fat Man he is one of the pickest eaters I know so off I went hopeful it was as great as he said. Well the staff was very hyper could be good to some I was more annoyed then anything but hey if I worked somewhere with sweet tea I would be bouncing off walls to. So I order we get everything it's hot it's fresh but it was just ok there are 2 exceptions the sweet tea is Fabulous and there Texas Toast was the best ever and I'm not even a fan of Texas Toast! The chicken well it reminded me of chicken fingers from a hospital and the French fries where as someone previously said on par with Del Taco. But on the next occasion I get talked into going there I think I'll just gets sides. The chicken I can live without"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and the food is always amazing!!! The ice is grade A haha and I always love their little intro when you pull thru the drive thru! All the people there always have a great attitude and have fun while they're working I love it"}
{"text":"Texas Toast and Cane's Sauce. Really, that's all you need when you come to Cane's. Something about the buttery, crispy deliciousness of the Texas Toast with the creaminess to the ambiguous Cane's Sauce (similar to a Thousand Island dressing with far more pepper) - it's euphoria in your mouth.  As for the chicken fingers, they are definitely better than what they used to be. When Cane's first came to Vegas, the fingers were dry and the downfall of the place. However, they have most certainly improved - moist and perfectly fried. The fries are decent, just sub-par crinkle fries that I tend to not even order. The slaw is good, but nothing extraordinary.  Then there's the tea - a bit too sweet for my liking, but always consistently good.   But I'm telling you, the toast and the sauce. All you need really. If anything, get the chicken on the side."}
{"text":"The menu is so small but just enough! Toast, fries sauce and chicken! You don't need a lot to make a great business!   The chicken is always so soft and juicy inside and crunchy and seasoned on the outside. The sauce is like a thousand island dressing. The toast is buttered, and the fries are salted perfect. The place is always BUSY! From the drive thru to the front counter. With all that business they are so fast with service. I was in and out within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Damn, when I heard they're bringing a Raising Cane's to SoCal, I was like woooooohoooo!! I love coming here when I go to Vegas and their chicken tenders are amazing and I should know because if you ask any of my friends what I majorly order at restaurants, it is chicken strips/tenders. Don't believe me? I order it at BJ's, Yardhouse, Red Robin, Cheesecake Factory, and even as an appetizer dish from Denny's, Ihop, and Boiling Crab and there's mooooore lol.   Besides that, if there was a Raising Cane's, I would probably go right now. Food is great, it's a fast food restaurant and the price is decent. Depending on location, it can be packed and the seating being limited. If any case, that would be my only thing about this location. There were lots of people standing up waiting for a seat because it was that popular. I do recommend putting the honey mustard and their special sauce together. I thought that tasted good. I definitely recommend coming here or just at least try it when you're leaving Vegas."}
{"text":"The chicken strips were really good but the sauce they provide to dip sorta sucked. Maybe I can try it again next time I'm in Vegas..."}
{"text":"AWWWW YEHHHHHH IF YOU LOVE SOME CHICKEN FINGERS THEN THIS BE THE PLACE RIGHT HEREEEEEE.  The place size is average, but you don't really have to worry about finding a seat. A table usually opens up every few minutes. Just order at the counter and wait till they call you up!  To be honest the chicken fingers and fries aren't spectacular nothing really taste worthy. But their texas toast is what makes up for it. When that warm crunchy bread hits your lips and you take a bite out of it, you'll just know...that this is not game. I don't know how to describe the flavor but it's just so damn good! I also love love love getting their iced tea! It's always on point and if you have a sweet tooth this is the perfect drink to go with your hot meal ^^.  Pro tip! You can substitute any of the items in your order for another item! I usually exchange the coleslaw for another toast :)  If I could change anything about this place it'd be the prices for their cane sauce. They  charge so much for such a small sauce -__-"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place ): it was good but not great.. Their sauce is good but I drowned my chicken in it because my chicken was so dry... The Texas toast is good and so were the fries. But I guess I had high expectations on the chicken and was sadly let down. Maybe I just had a bad batch. The sweet tea is so good! Try it. 3 stars for everything else!"}
{"text":"I was at this location yesterday and my order was for the most part right but instead of our 4 extra sauces and fries, we receive 1 extra sauce and fries and 2 chicken fingers. (Not complaining I'm down for the extra food) so I gave them a call and they knew exactly who I was as soon as I called. I was directed to Matt who was the manager on duty and he was extremely nice. He told me I could come at my convince for the misunderstanding and he would take care of me for the inconvenience. I went in today and again great service. This time Mario (gm) helped me and again I didn't even need to explain myself. I said my name and they knew the situation. To conclude this trip, not only did we spend money here yesterday but we also spent money again today because of the great service. Keep up the good work. This is the best canes I have ever been too. Thank you. You have an amazing staff and amazing management!!!  I will be coming back for sure ."}
{"text":"If you hate coleslaw.. you can sub it for an extra piece of toast. What what!!  Love this place and it is great for the days where you want to make easy decisions. Because there is literalyl 3 things on the menu. It is awesome!"}
{"text":"After passing the location many times I decided to give it a shot... and after seeing how many cars were lined up there regularly I was expecting a parade in my mouth... was it that??? Ehhh...Not so much. The likely most ordered box is the combo box for about $7 after taxes. It's basic chicken strips, drench fries, some cole slaw oh! And a piece of Texas toast. The chicken was nothing to write home about. Regular old fried chicken strips... not very seasoned but I suppose they bank on their sauce which is okay. I'm not a big sauce person. The cole slaw was good... the friend were regular old crinkle cut fries and for some reason had some funky taste... but I'm going to charge it to the grease possibly needing to be changed. The Texas toast was well Texas toast. Their \"Arnold Palmer\" better known as a Muddy Water...(half sweet tea half lemonade) was okay.   I'll give them a solid 3 because they're fairly fresh and the service is friendly. This is a good choice when you don't know what else to eat and just need something quick and filing."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Very nice and they go above and beyond better than other canes I've been to."}
{"text":"Always been a fan of Canes. Today they were packed to capacity.  You could tell the workers were racing. One tiny snafu but Our food was perfect. These employees are second to none.   I will definitely continue being a loyal canes customer."}
{"text":"Love this place but really wish The drive-through would run a lot faster. even at 1:30 in the afternoon it still takes a while to get through the line. People who have 30 minute lunches be warned it will take you a while to get your food!"}
{"text":"This will be my LAST visit to Raising Canes. The service and the employee attitudes are horrible, nasty and mean spirited. With the exception of my first two visits my experiences at this location have been horrendous. Missing items, cold food, poor customer service and accusations of attempting to get free food. On this visit I ordered a Caniac Combo plus an extra order of fries. After waiting almost 10 minutes for the order to come I noticed that one of the included items was missing (not he first time this has happened). It was the coleslaw. I went to the counter and informed the woman behind the counter of this missing item (she was the one who, initially, took my order. Her replies back to me were: A) Are you sure? (I told her to come over to where I was sitting and have a look for herself) and B) You must have substituted it for something else (no, I didn't and showed her the receipt). She, still, refused to give me the slaw. Finally another employee intervened and handed me a slaw. As all of this is going on Paul, the location's General Manager, is sitting at a table no more than 5 feet away. He does nothing to help. Just sits and looks. Fifteen minutes later he decides to come over and asks me if everything is okay. DUH!! I told him that you know what happened. He gives the most lukewarm apology and walks away. NEVER AGAIN will I come to this location and, most likely, to any Raising Canes location. I am fed up, totally, with this restaurant chain. It's like they don't care about satisfying the customers."}
{"text":"I live near this location and eat here often. Most of the time the chicken and fries are great! Recently I have been getting some rubbery/tough pieces of chicken, kinda strange. Not sure if it is the meat before cooking or something that happens during the prep/cooking process.  I really like the way the fries and chicken strips go with their sauce, good combo. The drive through can get REALLY backed up, it is not uncommon to see the drive through very busy at evening dinner hours. Service is usually very fast if I go inside. The workers there are nice and courteous (most of them anyways)."}
{"text":"These guys messed my order up TWICE! I didn't get bread today, and yesterday they forgot my drink. I'm unsure of there business practices."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in month's. Why? Bad service the last time I was here. The service and overall experience was exceptional and I always left ready to come back again. The last time i was there will be the final time i will be there. It might be better now, but I'll leave that decision to you."}
{"text":"The service was friendly, and the chicken ok. Fries were cold and not good. The drinks were served dripping down the outside in the drive thru. I also don't like to be asked for my ID for a cheap fast food purchase. Especially without the option to use debit and enter a pin. Giving some teen my ID at a fast food restaurant is not appreciated."}
{"text":"Place is a mess, all booths were filthy or had food and crumbs scattered everywhere. The place stays open late but shouldn't be this dirty. Food is usually good but when it's this dirty on the outside it sort of makes you think what the back looks like."}
{"text":"Spent 20 minutes in the drive through, not good service. Sorry if my review is too short, just nothing good to say."}
{"text":"I heard this place was really popular in Boston.  And it's my friend's favorite chicken joint.  I personally thought it was okay, nothing great or mouth watering.  It wasn't bad though.  My friend and I each ordered the 3 chicken finger meal, which included the 3 chicken fingers, a lot of fries, their special sauce, and a drink.  If you want a free drink and it's your first time hitting up this place, check in on FourSquare so you can get a free drink if you order a meal; I believe it was lemonade.  I checked in after the fact and found out what I could have gotten.  What was lame was I couldn't save the deal for later like how Yelp allows us to do so.  Just an FYI...  Oh yea, they have the staff call out your name very loud to let you know that your order is ready.  If you don't come for it, they'll go looking for you in the restaurant, which I liked.  I didn't like how the tables weren't clean.  A good # of tables had crumbs of chicken and stuff on it.  They should have the staff going around more often to clean them, especially since this location was pretty busy."}
{"text":"Love some cains the chicken is always great and hot. Always get my order correct when I visit the drive through...The Cain sauce is the best!!"}
{"text":"First time I've ever tried it n it was bomb. The chicken was tender, the cane sauce was good, & Texas toast looks smaller in person but still good lol I would forsure go back"}
{"text":"I am fond of a good chicken strip now and again. yet the cane's I had was crispy on the outside and a bit slimey under the crispy crust! It skeeved me out so bad, I will never go back. It would be nice it they has a \"side\" of strips you can get without the mounds of greasy soft fries. Ill pass next time."}
{"text":"Best chicken strips I have had in a long time and who doesn't like Texas toast!?"}
{"text":"I went there the other evening around 11 PM and was delighted to see they were still open in spite of the fact that the Arby's across the street had closed. The layout of their parking lot is horrible and the wait was absolutely insane. There were 4 cars ahead of me in the drive through and it took them 10 minutes to move the first one so I could get to the menu and place my order. When I did, I waited there for 5 minutes for them to move the next car and 7 minutes went by and STILL the car in front of me (who was at the window) didn't move. I was tired and hungry and I had lost patience. The problem is, their drive-thru is so narrow and surrounded by trees, you can't leave...you're basically trapped in there until someone moves. Luckily for me, I drive a big SUV and I drove up on the curb and around the car in front of me so I could leave this drive-thru from hell. I saw the single-bag orders going through the window so I knew there was no excuse for this to take so long other than an incompetent crew working that night. I will not return and will gladly take my money to Arby's or In-N_Out across the street. It's not like the place was fulfilling a catering order for 100 people...we're talking 4 people in a drive-thru and it took over 20 minutes to move them through..that's insane. I went across the street to In-N-Out and got my meal in less than 5 minutes, even with 6 cars ahead of me."}
{"text":"I'm upgrading my review to 4 stars.  I continue to eat here once or twice a week and the problem I outlined below hasn't repeated.  They provide fine service.  My previous review from 2/8 was for 5 stars, but I'm upgrading it to 2 stars.  I've been eating at this Raising Cane's about twice a week.  What I've noticed is that serving portions can vary greatly.  On one day the 3 chicken strips on my sandwich can be huge and the next day (like yesterday), the 3 chicken strips are minuscule.  The quantity of french fries can also vary significantly with the quantity being a very large amount of 1/3 of that amount.  And on Monday, they got me to sign up for the Caniac's Club with a card to be swiped each visit.  Then I go to their webpage to register and discover that there are no rewards based on number of visits.  It's just a scam to get my email address so they can send me advertisements."}
{"text":"We were there today (3/12/17) at around 1pm. We love Raising Cane's. We are from CA and they are just now making their way over. Anyway, the food was great as always but I felt the need to write a review because the customer service was fantastic at this location. There were 2 cashiers who were so customer service oriented. By the time we got our drinks and sat down, they were already bringing our food to the table. It was hot and delicious. As soon as guests left a table, they were right behind them cleaning up. They kept talking to my 2 year old son who thinks he is spiderman. They were great with him. I wish more restaurants had employees like these 2 ladies."}
{"text":"Great chicken fingers. Bland and boring coleslaw. Regular old krinkle cut fries. Come for the chicken fingers and cane sauce, skip the rest."}
{"text":"This location's dinning room closes at 11pm and the employee's are super nice about people coming in late or people coming in minutes before closing. They didn't rush my friends and I and still took our order at 10:59pm. The cashier and the employee's who were bussing tables kept telling us to take our time as they cleaned around us. I felt bad so I just packed my food and left but they were very persistent in their customer service. I really appreciated that! Their chicken is very good and it always tastes fresh each time I order from here. I commonly order the Combo, it comes with fries, chicken strips, bread, and a drink. When you dine in it's free refills, they have coke products available, as well as some sweet/ unsweetened tea. The only down side was the tables and chairs weren't wiped down, it was oily and it had crumbs to where my friends and I had to wipe it down ourselves. But we came in at a time when they were closing so it's understandable."}
{"text":"I can't explains why it's so good, but it is.  It starts with the sauce and finishes with the sweet Tea.  They serve nothing but chicken fingers, Texas toast, coleslaw and French fries.  Why this formula works, I will never know but it does.  You need to try it."}
{"text":"I LOVE CANE'S!!!  I've been to this location a million times, and the quality of the food is stellar.   I love the Texas Toast, and the Cane's sauce is awesome.    Sweet tea is great too.   And the Chicken?  Awesome.   :D"}
{"text":"What can I say?   Its Cane's!  Love it.  Standard, and similar to the other locations.  Delicious.  Friendly staff.    Winner. :D"}
{"text":"I don't see what's so good about their chicken fingers. I was curious to try them during a recent visit to Vegas. Definitely not Chick-fil-a."}
{"text":"It's always so very good - this time I brought my own bbq sauce condiments. If only RAISING CANE's offered bbq condiments -- I'd be in chicken tender heaven without my condiment stash. But until then... I love this place - the recipe for good food, CUSTOMER SERVICE and success can't be beat."}
{"text":"Ok people, In and Out has fab burgers and that's all they serve.. Raising Cane's has fab chicken fingers and that's all they serve.. for some reason In and Out is allowed to specialize but not this place? They aren't bland when you dip them in the yummy sauce that comes with them. Also this place is great for eating on a budget... the SO and I get the #3 (I think it's all of $7 or so), and it feeds both of us.   Love the toast, love the sauce, love the fries. When I'm craving chicken fingers this is my go to place."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers done to PERFECTION. Awesome sauce (I know it has to be basically thousand island, but I swear it tastes way better to me!), crinkle fries, yummy toast. AHH how I love it.   The employees at this location are particularly friendly and helpful. They came by to pick up my trash, and asked how I was doing twice.   If you're a semi-light eater I'd get the kid's meal. It's $3.99 for 2 strips + fries + drink. Perfect size for me. I typically add bread for $.69 too, because I'm a fatty."}
{"text":"It was good when they first opened. But I recently went to Raising Canes the chicken was ok, the fries were soggy and the sweet tea taste like it was sitting out for too long... it was beyond gross... the best thing about the meal was the bread and the sauce... I was really disappointed"}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times with co-workers.  The menu is limited but very good.  That sauce of theirs is super good!!  Service is always fast even when there is long lines.  Pretty clean for fast food, and everyone is super nice with great sense of humour.   Overall a good location."}
{"text":"They only do chicken and they do it well.  Wait, the sauce is pretty awesome, too.  Definitely a place I frequent.  I only wish there was one closer to my house.  Wait, probably best to not have one near me.  I love the food here so much that if it were close then I would probably be broke from eating at Cane's too much."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe your eating fast food, seriously, the first time I came here I was impressed. The chicken is not greasy, cooked just right, and my favorite part is the JUICY TENDERNESS- OOOHHH SOOOO TENDER. LOVE it. And thats not the only thing I love- HELLO?! Texas Toast! and the house sauce. The menu is super simple and everything is good so you cant go wrong :)"}
{"text":"I love the chicken strips, tx toast and sweet tea!  I was a little disappointed tonight to find the strips are smaller and thinner but hopefully it was a one time thing.  I always go through the drive thru and they are always pleasant and have the silly little things they say. Raising canes has been one of my favorites since I was first introduced to them about four years ago. Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here isn't necessarily bad, it's just bland and lacking taste. The staff is friendly, and the restaurant is VERY clean. All and all, I wouldn't object to returning here to eat in the future, but I don't think I'll be craving it anytime soon."}
{"text":"Originally tried this in Las Vegas... and these are about as good as chicken fingers get and the Texas toast is heavenly. I am NOT sold on their fries or coleslaw. I would like more dipping sauces to choose from too."}
{"text":"Good Simple Food. A great lunch spot just off the strip. The Texas toast rocks! Don't be surprised that half the patrons are under 12."}
{"text":"About as boring a meal as you can get without dozing off into your plate. Bland, plain and tasteless. The only part of the meal with any flavor was the large piece of salty bread. Avoid."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. Yummy secret sauce. Dippin the chicken, swimmin the fries, and soaking the bread in it. I've been to Cane's in New Orleans, Columbus, and Vegas. The crew at this store are super friendly and helpful - as is true with ALL the stores."}
{"text":"The chicken was crunchy and very juicy! The food came out within 5 min or less. He staff was very friendly and welcoming. The restaurant was clean and all the tables were wiped down properly. Overrall a good experience and will be visiting this location again"}
{"text":"Thank you so much for being a very friendly and honestly being the best location in town. Your company has done so much for our family by providing a good meal. The food is very fresh and yummy. I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed. I think it's worth the wait in the drive through, even though the entrance to it is a little wonky. Raising canes also needs to the there cole slaw and add tomatoes to their sandwich. Bus seriously the cole slaw at all locations is gross and they need to address that ASAP on a corporate level."}
{"text":"A good friend kept harassing us to try Raising Cane's. He loves it. I have no idea why.   Limited menu, no healthy options and the food was not that great. I make better chicken tenders at home. Your choices are deep fried chicken tenders or a deep fried chicken sandwich along with deep fried french fries. Seeing a pattern here? Deep fried everything. No thank you.   I can't imagine why anyone would eat here. Fast food doesn't have to be unhealthy. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Raising Canes is a fast food chicken tender resturant.  Their food is always made fresh to order, so definitely expect a little bit of a wait.  However, Canes is always a great place to grab hot, fresh chicken tenders.  I really love their specials canes sauce for my tenders, in addition to their garlic bread."}
{"text":"OK. Raising Cane's is just about one of my favorite places to eat at. Way back, years ago when I lived in TN, there was a place called Sawyer's. The owners readily admitted that they were blatantly ripping-off another restaurant (from FL, I believe). I think they were talking about Zaxby's, but having never eaten at one, I can't be certain. But the point is, copycat or not, they had insanely good, near-addictive food. Then, after it was sold off, the quality took an immediate nosedive and Sawyer's closed down. A place called Wishbone's stepped-in, opening several locations within a couple of years. I also knew the guys who owned this place and they also readily admitted to copying Sawyer's, right down to the dipping sauce, but these guys were kind of the slimy, slumlord types and, while pretty good at first, their corner-cutting and blasé attitude quickly manifested itself in pretty crappy food and I couldn't bring myself to eat there anymore. Then, I moved to ATL and found a burger joint called Canyons that also, while not what they were trying to be known for, had amazing (fresh, hand-breaded) chicken fingers, crinkle fries and that awesome sauce on their menu. The burgers were quite good, but they just couldn't compare to that chicken. Then I was banished to Carson City for far too long and nearly forgot how (if done properly) wonderful something as simple as fried chicken fingers could be. Then, I moved to Las Vegas and discovered Raising Cane's! Hallelujah! This place does it just right, freshly-made chicken, crisp, hot crinkle fries, that delicious dipping sauce and a glorious side of Texas toast! (Like with the other places, they also serve cole slaw, but that's just not my thing.) Everything is so simple, but so perfect. I'd eat here everyday if I could. The food is unfalteringly-fresh and tasty and the staff have always been extremely friendly to us. Yeah, maybe it's just fast-food fried chicken, but it is really, really good fast-food fried chicken...and exactly what I've been looking for for a long, long time now. I'm so glad I found this place."}
{"text":"I am in love with Raising Cane's!  Cane's has delicious sweet tea and everything is fresh.  I do wish their toast was crunchier. The service is friendly and welcoming.  You can tell they have fun at work and do a good job at the same time. It is always busy in here."}
{"text":"Good place, good service.  The food's good too, but you better like chicken fingers.  Much in the style of In-N-Out burger, this place goes with a very minimalist menu - chicken fingers and fries.  The food was good but not having any choices bores me..."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service with a smile. Chicken was hot, juicy, and crispy. The place was packed, but there were two employees constantly cleaning, so it was still comfortable. Our food was out quickly, hot and fresh. One thing really stood out to me. A Guest was in a wheel chair, and one of the employees took the time to get his soda and napkins for him."}
{"text":"I'm from Louisiana and that's the original home of Raising Canes    This is not a burger joint and they don't do anything but chicken strips and fries, they they are fast, fresh and dam good.     The canes sauce is awesome too and I dip my bread and fries in it too.  They also have a great sweet tea if you like iced tea.    Here is a tip.  If you get the caniac which comes with a bread and a slaw, you can just ask to substitute another bread for the slaw if you prefer.  My wife and I order that and split the meal whcih will feed two for under $10.00.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me, \"the next time you're in Vegas, go to Raising Cane's.\" So after a night of a few drinks I woke up with a fried chicken craving!!  I took a taxi from Bellagio over to this location and the food was ok, I should've stayed on the Strip. Nothing too special here. The chicken tenders were freshly fried and juicy, so that's were my 3 stars go! The crinkled fries were fries, and the Texas toast was a soft piece of bread toasted on one side. I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Not sure if i am reviewing the right location (not from Nevada) but the chicken was very good.  Not generic chicken strips like other fast food places.   Very large portions.  Extra sauce costs more which isn't cool.  Coleslaw wasn't very tasty.  Would go back for chicken and Texas toast for sure"}
{"text":"Yuk... Don't know what the hype is... We deserve a better restaurant in this location..... Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"In terms of taste, all of their competitors make much better chicken. However, if you're hungry for late night munchies, I suppose anything is worth 5 stars. Service is always exceptional, though. I like the concept of the small menu because it makes the whole thing really simple for both the customers and the employees."}
{"text":"KFC move aside!  If you're looking for some really tasty non-greasy fried chicken, then look no further as this is the place to come.  Be warned though they only serve chicken fingers! The place can be a little crowded as it was on the weekend we visited so you may have to wait for a seat to open up if you're looking to dine in.  Alternatively you can choose the drive through but that line was long.   The restaurant was clean, well lit, and spacious though there wasn't a lot of space between some of the tables/chairs. Service was fast and the menu was very simple which I'm in favor of!   Ordered the 3-piece basket and a lemonade.  The lemonade wasn't too sweet but cool, refreshing and tasted as if it was fresh squeezed. The fries was plentiful and was shared.  The basket comes with a slice of buttered toast similar to Texas Toast which was soft, chewy and practically melted in your mouth. The chicken tenders was well seasoned, crispy, not greasy, tasty, juicy but what really stands out is that it was light.  It's filling but you don't feel that overstuffed after eating them.  I really like the simplified menu, the lemonade drinks, and the chicken tenders which is definitely a draw for me to be back here!"}
{"text":"My first meal in \"Sin City\" has landed my appetite in not only one of the hottest bookmarked businesses in Las Vegas; but a fast food joint  that I don't see back home. Raising Cane's are one of the many businesses that Las Vegas have that the Bay Area or the entire state of California don't. Maybe one day that founder Todd Graves will work on expanding the franchise to California. Hopefully, the Bay Area will be first.   I was here and ordered the \"3-strip\" Combo. For $6.99, I get three battered boneless chicken breast strips, with a side of fries, spicy dipping sauce and a thick \"Texas-Style\" grilled toast. I usually get chicken strips from businesses like Popeye or KFC, but Raising Cane's version are a tad better than the other competitors. I also get a fountain soda (Coke) with my meal.   My lunch: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZFyJ83LJkkO1dP82kzXKNg?select=oiFbSMhV9l4Uiz7DgTb52g  The meal wasn't too bad to jumpstart my visit in \"Hot\" Las Vegas.   As I was enjoying my lunch, I was admiring the picture of Snoopy embracing with his master Charlie Brown. \"How cute!\"  The picture: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZFyJ83LJkkO1dP82kzXKNg?select=OwGMpqVXfe-ovM2tad-YPQ"}
{"text":"Used to love their chicken so much but it's kinda gone downhill! Especially at night, you can tell the chicken has been sitting out for awhile sometimes and the chicken is so stringy and lots of cartilage. Ughh but the canes sauce  the sauce gives it a 3 star review but literally everything else is mediocre."}
{"text":"Having uncertainty when deciding whether you want thighs, breasts, tenders, drumsticks or a mashup of these?  No deciding here- chicken is one way at Raising Cane's & it's the right way!  Delicious combo options.  I'm not a chicken person, nope not even chicken fingers, however I crave Raising Cane's.  It's the Only time I do have chicken if any kind or combo.  The coleslaw is my absolute favorite! I will be honest and admit, I go here once a week order the large size of coleslaw and leave. It's addicting.  Yes, that dipping sauce they have is as well.  That sauce it probably why this is the only time I have chicken. No, no Texas toast for me- extra coleslaw it is!  I even dip the fries into that sauce.  Again, more coleslaw.  Then a chicken finger or two, dipped into the sauce.  No double dipping!  Extra dipping sauce as well- please;)."}
{"text":"Finger lickin' good;) Having sticky fingers here is a given, and the only way one should obtain these is by having the chicken fingers and fries here:) Succulent, piping hot, fresh and tasty.   No variety of sauces here, one sauce is all they provide.  Hey Raising Caines, why not bottle and sell this tasty sauce please?!  You sell the ice tea by the gallon, why oh why not that sauce?!  It's as addicting as my Peter Lugers steak sauce at home (which at times I sneak a tablespoon of).  I would do the same with that sauce! It is all about the flavorful sauce, extra sauce please since I also dip and no I don't double dip the fries;) The fries are always done right, not burnt and mushy.  The coleslaw may just be my favorite;)  Made with fresh ingredients daily- always order extra:)"}
{"text":"I am so happy that this place opened up right across the street from me! There is only one thing on the menu and that is chicken fingers, and boy do they know how to make good chicken fingers! The chicken is high quality and not overly breaded. There are 3 sides to chose from: slaw, texas toast, and fries. The slaw is alright but if you are not a fan you can replace it with another toasts or extra fries (highly recommend this). The texas toast is from another planet good! It is always toasted to perfection and lightly buttered. The fries are crinkle cut and always cooked nice and crispy. (I have had better fries in my life but these aren't bad).   Now let me tell you about their cane sauce. I really have no idea how to describe it other than it is the best dipping sauce I've ever had. When I first went there I was disappointed to find out that they didn't have ranch for my fingers but once I tried this sauce I was hooked. I get cravings in the middle of the night for this stuf! Which lucky for me Raising Canes is open until 12 every night and 2am on Friday and Saturday.   The staff is always incredibly friendly (sometimes too much so). If you are in a sassy mood and don't want perky, happy, smiling people around you don't come here. There are lots of boths to sit in, which I love. It is an awkward layout for big groups though.   Awesome place! Great food and great service! Just don't forget to substitute the slaw for an extra toast or more fries and you are set.  *The drive thru isn't super fast because they cook to order the chicken. *They only have one sauce option (that I LOVE) but I could see kids not liking it"}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Especially for the cheap price. My fiancé and I make an effort to come here every time we drive through Vegas. It's so delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm a Canes regular..at least at the Centennial and Decatur (@215) locations. Ate here last weekend and the fingers were tiny. I had guests from out of town and they mentioned it first...cmon Charleston Canes....you can do better."}
{"text":"Hands down if you love chicken strips you'll love this place. It's always fresh, flavorful, hot, and yummy. The cane sauce is a must. French fries are crinkle cut. Thick piece of Texas toast with a hint of buttery garlic. I usually don't like fast food Cole slaw, but it's good. Not awesome but good. Lemonade is tasty and fresh made. Not that chemical tasting minute made stuff. I wish we had this place where I live. But until then we will visit everytime we come to Vegas. Or wherever else we find a Raising Canes. I would have pics but um..... we ate Alladat! Maybe next time. #greedy"}
{"text":"Love the food but this place was filthy. Tables were sticky full of crumbs. I had to wipe down the table and seats. 2 stars for being dirty."}
{"text":"Not really much more needs to be said about this successful chain.  Happy to add this review for this brand new location near Summerlin.  I love it, however I do know that there are those who do not.  To each their own :)"}
{"text":"Went to Raising Canes today. First I have to say the place was clean and the staff was nice. I had  the Box which consisted of 4 chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw ,toast and drink. The chicken was hot and not too greasy and seemed pretty fresh, but bland bland and more bland !! The sauce was okay but no real spice or flavor, need more choices in sauces, fries soggy not fresh, frozen and not cooked well, coleslaw out of a box not fresh. In my opinion it was very expensive for the quality of food. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! The best Chicken strips. Fries not that good, ask to substitute for coleslaw or extra bread."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to say about Raising Cain's.  They seem to have an identity crisis.  Is the restaurant Cain's (in big letters) or Raising Cain's (with the word \"raising\" in ultra-small letters?).  Why use the word \"raising\" if it really isn't important as a part of the name?  Yes I know it was somebody's dog's name.  Memo:  nobody gets that.  I accidentally found a location tonight (the one I'm reviewing) after seeing a billboard sign.  Kudos, your advertising dollars were well spent, I guess, by placing a billboard right over the store I probably would have seen anyway.  I never heard of them so I thought it might be a good alternative to KFC, as I had a major chicken urge.  Turns out that it looked a LOT like stereotypical fast food restaurants.  And it turned out is is.  With one exception.  While most fast food places have a very diverse menu with one or two featured favorites, Cain's does not.  Their menu, in fact, is downright weird.  The girl who greeted our bewildered looks simplified it ... \"we got chicken, chicken and nothing but chicken\".  Yeah, but only in one form.  What they call \"fingers\".  Can you order a box of 2 or 4 or 6 or 8 fingers with a side of slaw or fries?  Nope.  You get your \"choice\" of one of 4 packages that they're selected for you that have a mandatory drink and an extremely limited choice of peripheral items.  We wanted to take about 6 -8 pieces of chicken home with a side of enough slaw to comfortably feed 2.  Nope, can't do it.  The best we could do is buy that many extra sides of chicken \"fingers\" at over a buck each and a pound of slaw (way too much) and total price way too expensive.  Turns out the girl at the counter was creative.  We could substitute the hell out of any of the pre-determined combos, but we would only end up saving about 80 cents by doing so.  At that point nothing looked good.  But it was late, we were hungry and it looked like an entire high school's sports team had just arrived so we each chose the box with 3 chicken \"fingers\", subbed slaw for fries, deleted the drink and accepted the so-called Texas Toast.  Got it home and opened the box.  First impression was it was hard to believe how tiny everything was (except the toast, which was huge and probably there to delude you into thinking you had a filling meal.  The \"fingers\" were just that.  The only thing that kept them under any consideration was that they seemed to be made from real chicken meat rather than the ground up chicken paste some of the other fast food places are known for serving.  But the \"fingers\" themselves were dry, very bland and had too much breading.  Adding to the tiny \"fingers\" was a slaw container about the size of a shot glass.  Really?  Cabbage cost you so much you can't serve enough to have your customers get a real taste of it?  The \"toast\" was, well, a fat slice of bread, mushy and pretty tasteless.  And the final thing, a small tub of dipping sauce, tasted great but I prefer my chicken to taste good enough that it doesn't need dipping.  Bottom line:  as you were folks, nothing to see here.  They don't even serve real chicken parts like wings and breasts and legs.  Dull.  Boring.  Not worth going back.  Oh and my rating?  It started as 3 and dropped to 2 mostly because I got a nasty tummy ache right after eating.  Not saying anything for sure about what caused it but that is only the second time I ever had a negative food reaction ever in any Phoenix-area restaurant."}
{"text":"Love, love, love! Great food and good people working there. I do have a suggestion for them though. My dad loves your chicken but instead of just fries, coleslaw, and texas toast, he'd like to see more of a variety of sides. He'd also like to see different pieces of chicken and not just chicken fingers. I am happy with it the way it is, but you should probably increase the menu for others."}
{"text":"I swear every time I go to Raising Cane's I think the workers hate me, because I always put in complicated orders that don't need to be complicated. The first time I asked for just a few chicken strips, without fries and just the coleslaw and texas toast. When it would have been much easier to just order on of their pre-set menus. The second time I asked for a party tray of chicken strips and a few cups of coleslaw and texas toast, and again it would have been easier to order one of their preset menus. Sorry Raising Cane's! I need to read your menu next time.  but seriously though, that FRIED CHICKEN, TEXAS TOAST, and the SAUCE. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"There's just not much that can go wrong with deep fried chicken! The meat fell apart so easily, and it was so tender and juicy. The outside was really flavorful and crunchy, and the chicken was extremely hot, fresh out of the fryer.   DAT SAUCE THO! Dip it, drizzle it, drench it, bath it, slurp it, lick it, either way it's D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S.  Texas Toast! I was thinking that this would be like french toast when I heard about it, but it's more like a really yummy dinner roll. Coming back to Raising Cane's again."}
{"text":"This is the dirtiest Cane's We have ever been too  all the tables and seats are full of grease and crumbs. The floors, that's another story . At least the food is good."}
{"text":"I tried the Caniac combo: 6 pieces, toast, fries, cole-saw, and drink.  - Chicken fingers are better than chick-fil-A! Very tender, soft yet, crispy! - Sweet tea is similar to McDonald's (which I like), but more addicting and less sweet.   - Fries are not special, reminded me of frozen bought fries.   ^___^"}
{"text":"I love this food.  I don't like too much fast food, but this food is always fresh, hot and delicious.  The toast, which I wasn't even going to try at first, is very tasty.  The SAUCE is marvelous.  Addictive.  I could eat it on anything.  Fresh fries.   Chicken is moist, marinated, wonderfully cooked and hot.  Even their ice for the drinks is perfect texture.   I don't live by one of these, good thing, I would be here all the time!"}
{"text":"This place is scrumptious. For fast food chicken fingers! Man! These were succulent and juicy. I normally hate these kind of fries but they do them well... And they have a peppered fry sauce. Awesome! The place was clean and the brought the food out quick. They have Dr Pepper here too! Believe me, Coke products are hard to find near the strip."}
{"text":"The chicken was soft and tender, the fries had a lot of flavor, and the bread was delicious! Best of all, no wait time!!! Love it!"}
{"text":"Best place to get a late night snack. There's now a location in Southern California which is great. Their lemonade is also super good."}
{"text":"The one and only sauce is pretty good. The fingers also are fried just right!"}
{"text":"Will  not be back!   My receipt says Amber T took my order in the drive through.  I told her it was my first time there.  I ordered 10 chicken fingers. She asked if I wanted sauce.  I said yes and asked her what kind of sauce they had.  There were two choices.  I asked for 2 of each.  I got three of the same sauce.  Chick Fil A  is much better with great sauces."}
{"text":"True quality Sweet tea outside of the south is hard to find but I wouldn't expect anything less from a Louisiana born company and they do deliver not only in their tea but in the quality of their chicken, sauce and consistently friendly staff.  Yes it is fast food but for value, taste and service they are hard to beat."}
{"text":"Chicken is lean and delicious , Texas toast is to die for , and the sweet tea!? Let's just say we often take home a gallon to go . Very coleslaw too.  Get extra toast- the fries are so-so. Very friendly staff inside and in drive thru as well ."}
{"text":"I live in California and look forward to visiting this establishment every time I visit Vegas. Best part of the trip."}
{"text":"It's a pretty popular place for lunch time. It can get busy during lunch hours. They have friendly workers and the food is great long with their amazing sweet tea! They also have another location near arrowhead mall up north in Peoria. I sometimes would get uncooked chicken strips over at that location where it's lightly pink. But this location I have not had a problem with it yet! For some of you, if you guys haven't found out, they have hot sauce too if you ask for it, it's not displayed."}
{"text":"We definitely need Raising Cane's in California. Love it! I look forward to visiting whenever in Phoenix or Louisiana. I'd trade in KFC anyday to have a CA Raising Kane's :-)"}
{"text":"I have to laugh at the fact that someone below seemed irritated by the lack of 'healthy' choices. It's a place serving fried chicken. If you want healthy, you started off in the wrong place. Fast food is never healthy, not even when you're ordering a salad. Enough of my rant on common sense from the masses.   This place does a very few things and they do them all well. I have been here several times. The chicken, fries, toast and cole slaw are always good. Is it going to send you screaming out to tell all your friends? Probably not. But it's good and their menu is easy to order from. It's also better chicken than you will find at probably 90% of the normal fast food drive-throughs.   It's definitely a place I like hitting up when I can and I will continue to do so. I have yet to have anything there that was a turn off."}
{"text":"Because sometimes chicken fingers ARE the answer. This place seriously is too good. I'd eat here all the time if I could. And I would also be 200 lbs bigger. So I guess it's good I dont.  But seriously it doesn't get much simpler than their menu. Do you want 3 chicken fingers and fries? 4 with fries? 3 on a bun with fries? Or get a caniac combo with 6 and two sides? The answer is always yes.  Do yourself a favor and ask them to swap out your coleslaw for an extra toast instead."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Raising Cane's, let me count the ways I love thee!  I've been wanting to try for a while but I thought, \"how good can a place that only serves chicken fingers be?\"  I got SCHOOLED.  It can be *really* good.    They serve up juicy and fresh (not frozen) chicken tenders; Texas toast, which is the best side ever; crinkle cut french fries, which just hit the spot sometimes, you know?  I did think the french fry portion was a little modest, so-to-speak.  But I chose the 3-finger meal and was full afterwards.  The dipping sauce is the real deal - so good.  My husband raved about the crushed iced.  I was all, \"really?  The crushed ice, babe??\"  But I admit, there's just something about it lol.  I do think it's strange that lemonade is 10 cents extra but no biggie, it's good.    This location feels like it should be UNLV's student center lol.  Just has that college feel.  It's cool though.  I remember those days and would have been there almost every day!    If you haven't been here yet this place is going to surprise you with how simply good it is.  It will fill you and you will enjoy it, but don't take my word for it.  Ready.  Set.  GO!!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't good. The chicken tenders were soggy and the toast. The fries was good but other then that very disgusting. Customer service was wack they look very unhappy was t cheerful at all... just being in there for 5mins seen a few bums in and out and while we was eating one came up to ask for money... if I can give no stars I would."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite fried chicken place in the valley. Way better than the other big national chains."}
{"text":"Fast fresh food. Alot of food for the price. The sweet Tea is delicious. And the location couldnt be better."}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is awesome. I always order the Big Box, The Fingers are made fresh and come out HOT. So its best to let them cool off for a bit. The French Fries are good, offering Onion RIngs wouldnt be a bad thing. The Staff are always friendly and checking to make sure everything is ok. Something about the sauce. I prefer the Sweet Tea. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers taste just like it does at other Raising Cane's. Fresh food and french fries and the sweet tea. Friendly staff BUT they need to stay on top of keeping the tables clean because i had to wipe down my own table."}
{"text":"I must have ordered a vegetarian combo as there wasn't enough poultry in my meal to spark a PETA protest. Perhaps they were running low on chicken but my fried strips were not much larger than a French fry and contained little to no chicken. Far different from the location on Las Vegas Blvd which always has plump, juicy chicken strips. Even my dog was unsatisfied and went in search of table scraps elsewhere. 2 stars for the Cain sauce though!"}
{"text":"I have heard so much about their food, and the chicken fingers are delicious and juicy.  The Texas toast is terrible, coleslaw not bad and thankfully they have real tea...not that flavored crappola.   Location is terribly busy, little parking and seating is difficult to find. All in all, certainly worth the chicken.   Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"I kept on hearing about this place from my friends whenever they went to vegas and I have been meaning to try this place for awhile now. So I figured the best time for me to try it was when I was hungover this past weekend.    I got the Caniac Combo and shared it with my friends.It had 6 strips, cole slaw, texas toast, fries, large drink, and 2 Cane's sauces. The strips were really good and did not taste like most standaard chicken strips. And the sauce is what makes this place sooo soo good. Its addicting. The fries were ver bleh though...nothing special.   I wish they would open one in Orange County...This place is really good for a fast food joint and I usually don't like going to fast food places too."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice. The first time I dined in and had my truck filled with my sons bikes. My son went for a ride on one of the bikes and the workers saw this and ask us who owned the red truck,  that someone may have stolen a bike. They were watching out for their customers. How very nice.   The next time I went to raising cane I went through the drive through and the attendant ask me if I was having a good day, I told him I was not having a good day and he bought and paid for my dinner ! What? Who does that? I could not hold back the tears at this kind act. Thank you Gabrial!!! You have no idea how that affected my life. You see my son (the same one on the bike & about your age) had just been incarcerated unjustified and I was feeling very sad and alone and betrayed by the court system. You are an angel. Restoring my faith in the human race."}
{"text":"I love Cane's! Service is quick and fast because all they serve is chicken fingers. they have their own sauce which I love and the tenders aren't greasy. First time I tried it the sauce was bland but next visit it was much better. They make the batches so it varies depending on mixer person. The Canes over on 79th ave and Bell has more of a chipotle kick to it so if you like smoky heat head over there. the one on cactus has been consistently good for food and service. We only had one instance of bad drive through service with a young lady who didn't seem to give a crap about orders that day with an attitude to go with it. 1 out of 25 isn't bad so we will continue to patron Canes :)"}
{"text":"I tried to pay for the order with my phone. Samsung pay works on any kind of a machine that accepts magnetic strip card payment. They said something about the policy and that they don't accept that kind of payments. Made me feel like I'm trying to cheat them out of paying or something. Poor experience. It's 21st century. Keep it up Cane's."}
{"text":"Do you have a hard time deciding what to eat at a restaurant?  Do you like chicken fingers & fries?  If you said yes to both, then this is your place. The food is decent, the restaurant is clean, & the staff is friendly.  If you're feelin' like fingers & fries, eat here."}
{"text":"Great Texas toast, incredible dipping sauce, fries are so so, the chicken is always cooked right, and the fresh lemonade is worth the visit alone. Walk-up service, employees have always been polite. Bathrooms have always been clean."}
{"text":"You wouldn't really think to ever go to a place that sells just chicken fingers... But I'm so glad my friend dragged me in here on our way home from Vegas! Their chicken fingers are so moist and the batter is unlike and chicken fingers I have ever had! I didn't think I would finish four (their big pieces) but I couldn't resist! They were so good!! The house made sauce they came with was a little too peppery for my liking, but they went just fine with ketchup. Also try their house made lemonade and iced teas! Definitely coming here after every Vegas trip! See you soon Canes!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and it was pretty good. Here is the deal, it is fast food, but there is always room for variety.  Chicken tasted much better than most fast food chicken."}
{"text":"Went early and only had one car in front of us in the drive thru. We wait 15 minutes for our food to get home and see that it is wrong! We ordered two Caniac meals no slaw extra fries and then two extra sauce and three toast somehow ended up with 7 pieces of toast and a handful of fries! Between the two meals what a waste! Ice was melted because drinks were given right away, fries were cold and chicken didn't seem fresh have no idea what took so long!"}
{"text":"A co-worker told me raising cains was good and I had seen under cover boss which featured raising cains long ago but there was no location in Los angeles. When in Vegas there quite a few locations. I happen to be staying at a casino near one. So I decided to try it.   I wasn't impressed it was decent but not great. Without the sauce it would be just too plain to me. I wish they had more sauce options then their house sauce. Also I got it to go and when I got to my hotel the fries were basically all soggy. I was only five minutes away.   If it was my only option to get food I would go back but I wouldn't go back because it was so good. It's ok."}
{"text":"Let me just say. I love canes. I visit more than I'm proud of. Usually once a week. However this location seems to be gradually getting worse. When I first started coming it was great. Food was always perfect. Customer service was great. But not anymore. The employees aren't very friendly anymore. The past few times I've ate here the chicken and fries (especially chicken) has tasted like old / burnt oil. It ruined the whole meal. They've also forgotten something (usually sauce) the past few times too but no biggy theyre usually good at fixing mistakes. Also, the lobby hasn't been as clean as it usually is. The employees are usually on top of it but now most of the time I find myself cleaning the table off myself or having to wait for one to be cleaned. The soda has been off lately too not as \"crisp\" I guess you could say. Not quite flat but not super carbonated either. However I still give it 3 stars because the food usually is good, the service is always quick and bathrooms are always clean."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, they are not the best chicken fingers I ever had but in a pinch I'll head here. After leaving a concert on Friday night I was desperate for a small bite to eat, didn't want a greasy burger or spicy taco's so late at night. I also didn't have the patience for a sit down meal. Raising Canes is around the corner from our house and was relieved when their drive thru was still open (til 1 am on Friday and Saturday). Their chicken is tender white meat pieces, never greasy, cooked to order, so they are always fresh. I hate the dipping sauce (my hubby loves it), so I've been known to take a bottle of Kens honey mustard dipping sauce with me to the restaurant (shhhh!). I'm not a fan of crinkle cut fries, so I skip em. The coleslaw is okay. Love the Texas toast though. Their ice tea and lemonade is an added bonus:)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Definitely  not good for the diet but excellent treat yo-self days. The employees are always enthusiastic and welcoming! The service is fast and the drive thru is efficient despite them being busy almost all the time. Food is consistent tasting each visit."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that the reason I eat here is because they have the best fast food chicken fingers that I can find in my area. That, and the bread and sweet tea are really good, too. I would give Raising Cane's as a company at 4 stars normally. They would get 5, but they only offer their special sauce. I don't care for that sauce, so I end up buying my own sauce elsewhere. This location gets 3 stars due to the not so good experiences I've had here. The location of the restaurant is terrible, and the parking was not well thought out. Sometimes, the drive thru line wraps around the building and blocks people from getting out of parking spaces. The one time I didn't have to deal with a crazy parking lot, I went inside to order my food since I was ordering for 3 people. The girl at the counter was pretty unpleasant, and didn't get my drink order right. I might return, if I am in the area again, but I am certainly not going out of my way for it anymore."}
{"text":"Came in the morning time the staff was so amazing I couldn't believe this is a fast food restaurant. Morning staff you're amazing"}
{"text":"How does one screw up chicken fingers?  You're probably thinking dry, overcooked, not enough meat are acceptable answers?   Not to me.  Whether it's at a place that specializes in typically plump, tender and juicy fingers like Raising Cane's serves or whether I'm at the bowling alley eating a flat and dry piece of breaded cardboard, I usually end up satisfied.  All that being said, Raising Cane's makes a stellar example of these delicious fried treats that I have a hard time resisting.  I almost always end up with the Box Combo, which comes with a generous portion of fries, a piece of texas toast, 4 chicken fingers, and some negligible side of cole slaw.  Do people eat those?  I don't even bother asking others in my party anymore if they want it.   The texas toast usually is a good balance of toasted on the outside with with a soft middle.   The fries can be hit or miss and like a lot of restaurants can depend on if you stumble onto them fresh out the fryer.  The hotter the better.  The chicken can have the same issue, as I've had some moments where it felt like the chicken may have been sitting for a while, but this is by far not the norm.  They usually are hot and fresh as well.  I love the Cane's sauce they provide and like to mix it with the hot sauce to make my own miracle sauce.  I could bathe in this stuff.   Sure I'd have to take a shower afterwards and it'd get in some uncomfortable places.... on second thought, I would not bathe in it.  It's damn tasty though.  Service is typically fast and efficient, and the price is reasonable for the amount of calories, er food that you get with each order.  There should be one of these in every bowling alley.  3rd best idea I've had all day."}
{"text":"My friend had recommended that he enjoyed this place when he was in Vegas.  They finally brought the first franchise location out in the valley. Raising Cane is a paradise for any chicken fingers lover.  There are movie posters all around inside the restaurant and even in the bathroom area.  A disco ball above is rotating and reflecting light beams down while you place your order.  They have plenty of spaces for parking.  The chicken fingers were really crispy, but nothing too special.   I do like the Texas Toast.  As Norm mentioned, I wish it was more garlicky as well.  The coleslaw was far too wet for me.  I think the Cane's sauce was similar to one of Arby's sauce. I so wanted to give them more stars, however there are so many places that have better chicken strips for that price."}
{"text":"Want fast food fried chicken? Texas toast? Crinkle cut French fries? For a fast food chicken place it's pretty darn good. Is it good for you? No...but if you're in the mood for a fresh deep fried juicy chicken strip this place is for you.  Perfect for those  late night munchies :) omg the Texas toast is divine. It's so bad it's goood mmmmm.  We went at peak lunch and didn't have any issues with service. It's fast food people not fine dining!"}
{"text":"I decided to try out their chicken tenders on account of the rave reviews from a couple of my friends. The tenders are super moist and the breading has that perfect crunch. Surprisingly, what got me was their Texas toast and secret sauce. It was quite hyped up in my option; however, if a Cane's was near by and I was craving chicken, I would make the stop for it. The lines were long in drive through but I was in and out within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"When you hit prime-time this place is gang busters in and out.  When I have been during a dizzy busy spell - management has staffed well (I've even gotten service at the table and check up service!).  On off hours - it's just like any other fast food place.  Their sauce is great with the chicken for the the first 1 1/2 strips then it just goes down hill for me from there on taste (this has happened each time)...  I have a daughter that likes it and she loves the toast that comes with the meal.  It's just ok for me."}
{"text":"They fry their chicken in a peanut oil making it taste great. It's pretty unhealthy, as everything is fried, buttered, or has mayo. The staff is very friendly and the place is clean which is hard to find now a days in tempe."}
{"text":"Just left the drive thru 20 minutes ago (@11:30ish 07/30/16). Drive thru had a pretty long line. Wait time could have been better. Operations manager was working the register. Got home with my food, the chicken fingers I got were stuck together, breading still mushy and not fully cooked. Management should be aware if staff is stuffing large portions of battered chicken into the fryers, because that's what happens. Quality is not guaranteed. Fries were cold, guessing that they were old, and toast was damn near burnt. Their saying is \"one love\", but I can tell you for a fact NO LOVE went into my dinner."}
{"text":"The chicken is so tender on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside! I like the light breading that isn't the usual heavy fried chicken batter and when you dip it in their dipping sauce, it is outta this world! The crinkle cut fries are okay, the cole slaw is delicious and the garlic bread is usually something my kids steal from my plate since the kids meals don't come with it. My only gripe about this place is the price. For me to feed my family of four I usually spend upwards of $25 which is a little steep for a fast food joint. The fact that they have sweet tea makes up a little for that. This is a nice change of pace from other fast food restaurants so I'll keep it in my rotation."}
{"text":"Canes is a good place to eat if you are looking for strictly fries and chicken strips. The places is clean and the staff is very friendly. Their sauce is yummy. Only reason why I didn't give this place five stars is because they are stingy on their canes sauce. They charge u!!! :)"}
{"text":"The wait for putting in an order was pretty lengthy but that was not a problem for me.  Plus, the food came out fairly quick w/out any problems with my order (even with a big order).  The gentleman that took my order was pleasant. However, it was very surprising when I realized that military discounts only entails for one item on your entire bill."}
{"text":"Why this place is always packed is beyond me, the food is okay but not life changing. Everytime I pass by, there is an extremely long line both inside and outside of the establishment and have no idea why! I got the three tender piece meal and the best part was probably the Texas toast. The service wasn't excellent, it seemed as if the employees would rather be somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ive went a couple times and its always busy so the service can be slow. Food is good but a little pricey. The Texas toast is great! I think they should offer a dessert. I took my dog with me in the drive thru and they have doggie treats!! The parking lot is way to small especially during peak times."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time the other day. Service was fantastic and much to my surprise, for being an only chicken strip place it was really good. Chicken was just the right amount of crispy, a bit dry but then again most chicken strips are. The special dipping sauce was very good. We tried their lemonade which was mediocre. But everything else was great. Place was very clean. We went around 1030am and there was not much of a wait, but about 15 minutes later is got pretty busy."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite. Canes is a staple in my lunch rotation. This one is close to work and can get kind of crazy at lunch, but they still are quick and super nice. If you like chicken fingers that aren't muddled with that thick frozen coating, this is your place. Their sauce is awesome, but if you don't like it, you may not fully get the appeal. Lemonade is AMAZING."}
{"text":"I hit this drive thru for dinner on my home a lot of times and they are always pretty quick and friendly. If you've never eaten here, the chicken fingers and fresh and the sauce is amazing.   Can get busy inside on the weekends, so sometimes the tables aren't 100% clean, but hey, the food is amazing and if you come in during a quieter time all is well. I always recommend this place."}
{"text":"great food. fresh chicken that came out hot and fast. service was excellent and we came during dinner time, which was busy.   if you order a 6 price meal, you get two special sauces and a large drink which is perfect for two people.   they decorated the restaurant all for christmas, which was really cute and festive. definitely recommend this location. easy to get back on the highway from here and is close to the strip."}
{"text":"My son is  a very picky eater his 4 and its hard to please him ... but canes chicken did it for me ... their chicken is really fresh  ... u can tell change their oil very ofter cuz everything has fresh taste/...    their lemonade is a must try"}
{"text":"Awesome place, great sweet tea and amazing Chicken. The sauce is ok, but it doesn't quite do the Chicken justice. Very Clean place with friendly staff. :-)"}
{"text":"First time at this location and I'm giving it 5 stars bc of the short line (actually think there was nobody in line), which in itself is a miracle if you've ever seen the lines in so cal.  The food did not disappoint!  Chicken was hot and juicy and I'm drooling as I write this.  Some tips to enjoy this place is to eat it ASAP as it doesn't taste good when it's cooled down and to eat it with their special cane sauce.  If not, you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The box includes four fried chicken strips, french fries, cole slaw, and toasted bread.  The sauce is a tomato based with pepper.  I enjoy the crispy chicken strips, the sides, are just sides, but the toasted bread I save and dip in the sauce and that's why I go back to Cane's."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!!! Service was pretty good, high energy happy folks. I will be coming back for more"}
{"text":"This is my very first time at a Raising Cane's and after listening to all the hype from friends I decided to eat here. I'll have to say that it stood up to my expectations   Cane's is a nice place to grab a quick bite to eat if your in the mood for some delicious chicken.  Their breading is a lot lighter than Chick-fil-As but their chicken is SUPER juicy. The fries are average in my opinion."}
{"text":"Love it! Chicken strips and fries... strips are juicy and cooked perfectly. Their sauce is good mixed with hot sauce. Fast service."}
{"text":"I love this place! Believe it or not, Raising Cane's is #1 on my list of what to do when I go to Vegas (twice/yr). Isn't that hysterical? I love their food, from the chicken to the bread and dipping sauce. OH, and their sweet tea! Thank you RC, for your recipes, wonderful workers and amazing food!   I'll be back next time . . . . (I should probably open one in So. Cal!)"}
{"text":"I love this location because of all the young people working and they are so spunky! The food is hot and deelish...of course! Keep up the great work West Charleston!!! The Outlet location is a close 2nd behind you!"}
{"text":"I had to try this place before I went back home to LA. My cousin lives in Vegas and he always instagrams pictures of the food here.  It looked so good in the pictures, but they are deceiving! The taste of their chicken fingers were so blah that I've had better.  I love chicken fingers and I know that they're suppose to be crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. These were not crisp or juicy.  The price for the combos are a-ok as to why I didn't deduct even more stars. Their sauce that you dip the chicken fingers in is really tasty, that's probably what made me tolerate the chicken fingers more. The coleslaw was pretty good and the fries are good.  The bread it comes with is delish!  The sweet ice tea is sooo refreshing especially with the weather they have in LV. It's unlimited drinks if you dine in.  Would I come back here? Only if we need to grab a quick bite before we head back home to LA."}
{"text":"I checked out this place from a billboard I saw on the freeway. I'm a sucker for chicken strips, so had to check them out. When you walk in, it's a great industrial/ modern feel. They have pop culture posters & signs hanging everywhere. The menu is pretty simple, chix strips, slaw, fries and garlic toast, the options range in the amt of chix strips you want. I went with what they call The Box, I chose the lemonade, it looked fresh and was delicious. I enjoyed the chix strips, they were not greasy and actually had a good amount of chicken. The fries were the ole fashioned Ore Ida kind from when I was a kid. The slaw was ok and the garlic toast was great. The dipping sauce was average, I thought it was lacking a kick. All in all I would frequent Raisin Cane's again."}
{"text":"Solid food (once in a while).... First off I'm not a fries or chicken finger person on a regular basis BUT as a once in a while option (like maybe once a month), I think Cane's is pretty good. I definitely think price is decent and tastes are pretty consistent. Unlike other reviews the \"canes sauce\" is unique and tasty and I do like that peppery flavor.  Slaw is actually on the yuck side (you can sub another piece of butter toast in place of the slaw at no extra charge). It has really no flavor...needs something more it's just Bleh.  Butter toast is pretty yummy but what's not to like its bread and butter.  Fries are ok but nothing special about them.  Overall it's a good meal for lunch at a decent price.   Tip: canes sauce extra is .29"}
{"text":"I went at 11am on a Friday to try and avoid the typical lunch time rush and was surprised at the amount of time I still ended up waiting.  I stood in line for over 5 minutes despite the fact that they had 2 registers open and only 3 people in line ahead of me.  Then, I waited 14 minutes to receive my run of the mill chicken fingers with below average crinkle fries.  The toast was standard buttered texas style and the coleslaw was a little too runny for my liking.  The only thing worthwhile in this place was their dipping sauce which isn't enough to make the bland tasting chicken worth a good review.  While eating our lunch, a worker was cleaning tables and sprayed the table next to ours with a windex like substance which ended up misting my daughter and I.  Nothing like the taste of windex with lunch, nice touch guys.  I had pretty high expectations of this place given all of the \"hype\" it has received but I will not go back and won't recommend to any of my friends or family.  Chick-Fil-A has them beat by a mile."}
{"text":"I am hooked on canes big time the chicken strips have the best breading I have had on a strip. Its amazing some place could take such a staple and just blow it out of the water. Got to love the never frozen mentality of there strips. The Texas toast is a great addition to the meals and the lemonade is a must have and I always get a refill(not free but worth it)."}
{"text":"Best fast food/fried chicken on the planet. Hands down. When I am in need of a cheat meal, I am headed to Cane's. If you are looking to get fried chicken, I cannot express enough how badly you need to stop looking and just go here.   To Cane's: STOP CHARGING FOR EXTRA SAUCE. Still love you though."}
{"text":"I never really cared for chicken fingers until I moved to the west coast and tried Raising Cane's. Now it's my go to fast food restaurant. Chicken is hot and juicy, fries and good, and I love the Texas toast. The sauce is my favorite! The price is great too. This location is surrounded by ASU, so it's full of college kids during the evening/night and packed on late night weekends. I've been to this location at least 20 times and every time the fries seem to be missing salt, I'm not sure what that's about. Every other location gets it right. Would be 5 stars if fries got salted"}
{"text":"The food is so fresh! I had the box combo, 4 chicken fingers, fries, drink, and coleslaw. It was delicious! I went through drive through and it was fast and prompt! I really wish they would give 2 sauces with the combo, it goes well with the chicken--so make sure you ask for a second one if your getting take out. The bread that comes with it as well, I thought it was going to be hard and crunchy, but it was soft garlic toast- better than all the places that serve it hard as a rock! Oh also try the sweet tea- great flavor and not too much sugar. Overall, I loved it! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Gave Cane's a shot last night and really came away impressed with their staff and the food. The chicken was fresh, had the taste & consistency of chicken and we enjoyed it. The crinkle fries were good and their \"special sauce\" was pretty darn good as well. Their staff was very good for a young group and who are working at a fast food joint. At least 4 different people greeted us or said something nice and everyone was friendly and polite, job well done! I don't think we'll eat here too often just because we don't eat a lot of fried food but it was worth giving a shot and especially if you want some good chicken fingers and great customer service."}
{"text":"Great food, service - you get a lot for ~$10/person with the value meals. The fries are krinkle-style and and not too salty or over fried, which is nice. The texas toast is a nice inclusion for the meals too, and there's cole slaw as well. Go for the lemonade and ask for extra sauce."}
{"text":"I saw this place while home in Atlanta on Tv. Glad I tried it. It was really good for a chicken tender spot. Their signature sauce was yummy. Reminds me of zaxbys but better.  Try it for those quick cheap meals."}
{"text":"PROS: - Chicken fingers aka moist reasons to live - Texas toast.  It's so fluffy, I'm gonna die! - Cane's sauce - Sweet tea - Super friendly staff  CONS: - No ranch here, so fries get lonely  TIPS: - If you decide to share with a significant other, order the Caniac combo $8.29, which has 6 chicken fingers as opposed to the Box combo $6.79, which has only 4.  Trust"}
{"text":"Interesting place to eat when your in the mood for good chicken, a good friend recommended to try out the chicken. And I would say it's definitely good, though it's nothing special. The prices are reasonable and the staff are friendly and attentive.    The chicken is good but it's nothing special, I had friend that recommended the place. The food isn't bad but I wouldn't say it's the best chicken ever as my fridge would put it."}
{"text":"Got our food quick but asked for three separate orders and they put it all into one card and gave attitude lol."}
{"text":"This is really good chicken. It doesn't necessarily have the flavor that Chic-fil-a has but I think a combination of the crispiness of the batter  and juiciness of the chicken is perfect. Normally not a big fan of crinkle cut fries either but they are really good here. The sauce is pretty good too. Very reasonably priced as well. Anytime I see a Raising Cane's I stop coz it's that good. I don't know if he was the manager or what, but whoever was helping up front was also very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"They have the best toast! Chickens are always fresh. Love the crush ice that they used. Just don't like always having to wait for the long line and too many kids hanging out there."}
{"text":"I'd come back. Not bad as fast food restaurants go.   That said, I don't really understand the five star reviews. The chicken strips, while well prepared and tasty, aren't really that unique. I loved the Texas Toast. Didn't really care for the bland coleslaw. The Cane's dipping sauce was serviceable, but I longed for an alternative. The French fries were good, but just fries.   That said, I don't really understand the one star reviews either. We did not experience the poor customer service that some others have noted. Quite the contrary. We were impressed with the speed and efficiency of the staff at a very busy time. The menu does lack variety. I don't mind that either. It's okay to focus on what you do well. It's also refreshing to have the food delivered to your table.  Overall, a nice addition to the PV Mall area. Just be thankful it's not another burger joint!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this odd food joint we don't have in Hawaii. Upon pulling up my family was like.... what's with the creepy dog family photo thing? Then we came to call it the dog-chicken place because there's a logo on the wall somewhere with both.  Anyway, I hadn't expected the chicken strips to be so huge. I would definitely come back just based on the amount of food. Yes, people are saying it's bland but I actually kinda like it that way. Thing is, they were soft and juicy and not dry which is the beat thing about them, plus it's not regurgitated chicken-paste, it's actual white meat strips.  The large toast things caught me by surprise too. Why is all the food so large? Those tasted good but seemed far too oily and bad for me lol.  Either way, staff was friendly and I think my family got a great value for the money. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"When I ate meat, I would go here for juicy chicken fingers and addicting cajun special sauce. The fries are alright, nothing to drool about, but dip them in the sauce and they become your best friend. Prices are ok, but if you want extra sauce, you have to pay for it :( Best thing about this place? Bring your DOG through the drive through, and they will give it a treat!"}
{"text":"This was my very first trip ever to a Raising Cane's and pleased with my choice. I got the 3 finger combo which was fairly large meal (comes with a large amount of fries, Texas toast, and a drink). The chicken was made fresh and arrived hot to the table, and I was excited to see they serve crinkle fries! Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I was told about this place of a friend that used to live in California with me. When we came to Las Vegas she told me I had to eat here . she knows how much I like chicken and crinkle cut fries. And the sauce I can't forget the sauce the raising canes sauce is the whole reason why every time I come to Las Vegas I have eat here. It is super addicting. Like I've never had a sauce like it before. If I can bottle it take it back with me I would .  I wish there were more closer to me so I could eat there more than once every few months when I visit A MUST HAVE when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"First time at Raising Cane's and I was very impressed by the customer service from server 453 Gregorio at the south Las Vegas location . He was patient and professional taking the orders of our group of 5. The portions were great and best of all, the taste and quality of food was superb. I thanked the store manager for leaving a very good impression on my family and I."}
{"text":"3 fingers combo with Texas toast- hot off the fryer and tasted great Sandwich with fries- fresh and tasted great Sweet tea- great Crew- efficient and friendly"}
{"text":"This spot has some goood crispy, delicious chicken as well as good customer service too. This round I gotta give 3 stars because after sitting in that long line, they got my order wrong.. After going back and waiting in line they corrected my order and even upsized the drink for free, nice touch!"}
{"text":"When do I NOT come here?! Whenever i'm in LV, I usually stop by here before the drive back to SoCal. This time I rolled through with a party of 8 and we purchased their party pack. It came with 40 or was it 50 chicken strips? Texas toast, cole slaw, and we ordered some fries on the side. The chicken strips were juicy, not dry what so ever!! and the coating was tasty as always. I wish there were more Raising Canes and one in SoCal!!  Their sweet tea is better than Micky Dee's and their chicken is definitely better than KFC and Popeyes. My group that I rolled with was expecting the consistency and the chicken to be dry or over battered like the ones you get a KFC or popeyes but really enjoyed this meal and fell in love with the sauces."}
{"text":"...my friend came to visit me and bought me tenders and fries....the sauce is BONKERS amaze balls....so Yumma....I almost wish I never had it cause now I'm gonna be a bigger fatty from craving and wanting it all the time....seriously fresh and hot and THAT SAUCE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Turn down the volume on the music. I'm eating chicken fingers. I'm not at a music festival. It's so loud the cashier can't even hear the orders."}
{"text":"Being from the Bay Area of California, I had never heard of Raising Cane's.  Honestly, I don't care for chicken strips, chicken nuggets, or deep fried chicken.   I kept hearing about how great this place is.  A few months ago I moved a few blocks away from Cane's, so I gave it a try. 5 STARS!!!! 5 Stars for awesome food, cleanliness, fantastic employees, great atmoshere and consistant great service.  Did I mention the food is fantastic? The chicken strips are so good, mmm, the sauce is tasty, and I really like their fries & the texas toast.   I have had my friends try it and my family when they visit.  All of them have liked the food.   One concern . . . . I live way too close to this location!!! We have Cane's at least once a week and sometimes more often!  Mmm! I'm getting hungry :-)"}
{"text":"Was skeptical to try them as it looks as just another chicken chain popping up. Very simple menu, chicken fingers, fries, slaw, bread (buttered Texas toast). Not hard, shouldn't confuse the cooks. Was very satisfied with the plump tastiness of the chicken, not overly greasy as some places fingers become. A- in grade My only drawback to this place is I wish they would cook their fingers like an extra minute, I kinda like my chicken a little crispier and a tad more done, just for safety sake. On that note, I don't want to scare anyone off thinking they serve raw chicken, they do not, its the difference between a medium rare steak and a medium one, just personal preference. And i really wish they had a spicy strip. Their slaw is about a C, nothing special and you can get no slaw & extra fires in your meal. The bomb however which I rate a A+, their special dipping sauce which does cost a few cents if you want extra and their sweet tea & lemonade. Yum. Place has always been super clean with a nostalgic travel poster decor and the drive thru has always been lightning quick even with long lines wrapped around the building. 4 stars solid."}
{"text":"This is the WORST canes in the city. The drive-thru line is always ridiculously long and slow. I was parked once over toast, then they forgot my order and I had to go in and ask about it as I looked at it sitting in the counter.  Next time they asked me to park I said no and the girl slammed the window, when I told her to have a great day she rolled her eyes at me and slammed the window again.  The food is always soggy.  The employees are rude. They aren't personable. They never repeat the order back to you and they never get it right, then they get mad when you ask for what you actually ordered.  Tonight we waited in the drive thru for 15 mins until we got to the cones that block that little section next to the trash, and we ended up moving the cones just so we could get out.   I will drive the extra ten mins to the centennial location from now on."}
{"text":"I can never make up my mind so it's nice that they only have a few god options. Good place to eat when you are really hungry, as these meals will fill you UP! I also heard a rumor that it's not low fat. I'm not sure I believe it, though. I like that they advertise the #hashtag in the drive thru so you can upload your pics to social media!"}
{"text":"A favorite of mine!  Great tasting chicken & crinkle fries!  There dipping sauce is to die for! Get your Texas Toast buttered both sides, too!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't see what the hype is all about. This was the first place on my list after hopping off the vegetarian train last month. Well, the wait wasn't worth it.  Don't get me wrong, it was decent, but from what I've heard about the place, it didn't match its hype. Tenders were small and flavorless without the dipping sauce and the fries had nothing to them. Had to add salt, and I hate adding salt! Last, when they give you your drink cup, they fill it almost full with ice before you go to the self service station to choose your drink. I'm thinking, OK, the ice isn't at the drink station...but it is! So why are you giving me ice upfront? In hopes that I won't overload on soda? I ended up dumping more than half of it out because I hate a lot of ice in my soda!   Will I come back? Maybe. But I won't go out of my way to eat here. Only if in the area and with someone who was seriously jonesing for it."}
{"text":"I was excited to see this place open up near my house.  I took my 6-year twins because they love chicken strips.  I was quite disappointed when we went.  The service is absolutely atrocious.  I believe employees should have fun where they work, but these kids took it to a new level.  Many of the employees were horseplaying, and were therefore very inattentive.  We sat in the dining room far from the front counter and could hear the employees yelling and singing very loudly (and badly).  Again, I don't mind employees having fun, but not at the expense of some degree of professionalism.  My kids liked the food, so if we ever come back (not likely), we'll go through drive-thru."}
{"text":"The chicken was cooked to perfection. Moist not dry. The sauce is the best. Texas toast was yummy. I think they should add more items to the menu but every item is super good. Kids love Canes and they give out free stickers"}
{"text":"i visited this establishment when i was last in vegas, one of my friends said that this was a must try, so i figured i'd give it a shot  it's probably important to note that i'm not really a fan of chicken fingers, and after eating a raising canes, my stance did not change  i ordered the 3 finger combo, which came with 3 pieces of chicken fingers, fries, texas toast, special sauce, coleslaw, and a drink  sadly i thought the best part of the meal were the fries, they were crunchy on the outside, and weren't too salty, the fries went well with the special sauce too  the chicken fingures tasted dry, even with the special sauce  the texas toast was bland  the coleslaw was meh  this is supposedly a very popular chain in vegas and down south, but it's just not for me, i won't be going back here anytime soon"}
{"text":"Raising Canes was ok. But to me it reminds me of Zaxby's  from the south. They almost have the same type of stuff except Zaxby's have chicken wings, and they have salads and stuff. I think they got this idea of this place from there."}
{"text":"Trying Cane's for the first time while we visit Phoenix. Basic menu of chicken tenders, fries, coleslaw, texas toast and cane sauce. Chicken is good. Texas toast is a nice thick cut of bread but ultimately underwhelming. Fries were ok, the oil could stand to be changed. Bonus for me that they have PEBBLE ICE."}
{"text":"Possibly the first AND last time here.  I had read about this place and thought that it was a cool concept....do one thing and do one thing well (chicken fingers).  I decided to stop here on my way down to the game.  I went through the drive through and placed my order.  I ordered \"The Box Combo\" which included 4 chicken strips, cole slaw, fries and a drink.  The price wasn't bad (under $7.00) and it sounded like it would be fantastic.  The drive through line took at least 10 minutes before I got my food.  Once I did get the goods, I pulled over, parked and dug in.  Here is how the food was............  Chicken Strips-  Meh!  The strips were a decent size but there were a couple of things working against them.     #1.  These things were WAY too hot.  I appreciate freshly made food but maybe you might want to let that shit sit for a minute and drain or something.  These were so hot you couldn't even eat them without burning your mouth.  Even after mouth breathing/cooling and sitting there for 10 minutes, my last strip was as scorching as the first!    #2.  I really didn't like the breading.  It is a really thin coating that is just a bit greasy.  The breading was kind of falling off in pieces and just seemed a bit \"off\".     #3.  The taste of these things.  They were super duper plain jane.  It seemed like they could use a ton more seasoning and really didn't have any flavor.  The dipping sauce helped, but still didn't make up for the fact that these strips looked good but had no taste.  Were they the nastiest things I have ever had?  No.  Can I make just as good or better chicken strips at home?  Yep!  This is their niche and unfortunately I didn't think they were anything special.  I much prefer Popeyes strips...at least they have flavor!  Fries-  Standard crinkle cut fries.  They were ok.  Crispy but needed some more salt.  Cole Slaw- Didn't try it.  Texas Toast-  This was the best part of the meal.  Kind of reminded me of Sizzlers cheese toast but lesser quality (That is one thing Sizzler does better than anyone else....cheese toast.)  If I could have traded my fries and/or slaw for another slice, I would have done it.  Soda- Coke Zero tasted a little \"off\".  I have had a few instances so far in Phoenix where fountain soda has tasted weird.  Don't know what it is but Raising Cane's Coke Zero is in the same boat.  Sauce- Their sauce is a mayo based sauce...I took a tiny taste and didn't like it.  I did pay extra to get some honey mustard.  Their honey mustard sauce is actually pretty good.  Service in the drive through was friendly.  Slow but friendly.  I personally probably won't come back but I can see myself ending up here eventually...my wife loves chicken strips and I'm sure she will want to try this place out and I will be forced here with her.  Meh, right?  We shall see................"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic but I'm done coming here. I've been here about 10x and almost every single time they mess up my order. I just get frustrated going there now. How hard is it to make a meal no toast extra fries. I give up."}
{"text":"Chicken strips southern style.   Love the chicken, the sweet tea and the sides.    Price is right at ~$7 for the combo.     Ask for packets of hot sauce.   As far as the chicken goes, it's better than KFC (better quality chicken)... different than Chick-A-Fil (less spices).      I think it's worth a visit if you're in the mood for fast food.   Nothing you should go out of your way."}
{"text":"Raising Canes is hands down the best chicken strips joint in all of the land.   I'm a Californian and unfortunately we don't have any of these anywhere in sight. I usually get my fix whenever I hit Vegas. I was in Phoenix for the day and totally remembered that they have Canes in the area.   Their chicken strips are amazing along with the Canes sauce that comes with it. I always go with the Caniac Combo even though it's a lot to eat. The Texas Toast is amazing as well. It compliments the food very well.   I give this place a 5 easily, especially since their restaurant area is open until midnight. The other locations nearby are only opened until 11, with this one being open an extra hour. It definitely helped since I visited about 11:40 in the evening.   Definitely hit this place up. The staff is pretty nice as well. Great overall experience. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Raising Canes is the biz, seriously!  I'm not even really found of chicken strips but the ones here are pretty good.  The chicken they use and the way the make it is excellent.  On top of that is their Canes sauce that compliments the chicken well.    The fries are forgettable in my opinion.  I actually see the fries as their major downfall.  Just reminds me of Ore Ida homecooked fries.  The Texas toast is pretty good and goes great with the chicken.  The coleslaw too is great.  As you can tell, I ordered a Caniac Combo that had 6 pieces of chicken strips, fries, Texas toast, and coleslaw.  They've also got their ice down, similar to what Sonic's did.  Only downfall is that they put too much ice leaving you with very little soda.    Can you please open up some locations in Southern Cal?  That would be GREAT."}
{"text":"I just go for the bread and lemonade. I went during my lunch break and the service was pretty quick and I had all the condiments necessary to enjoy my lunch."}
{"text":"Very fresh delicious chicken strips. . The texas toast is soft and delicious with just a slight toasted top .....very well worth the stop in VEGAS before heading home to los Angeles"}
{"text":"Consistently good, even when ordering the \"Tailgate\" boxes. Best lemonade in town, although a little pricey. Fries are okay, not as good as the rest of the food. Five stars for the great customer service!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy. Favorite place to go if I'm in a hurry. I love everything they have. Nothing is ever bad, customer service is great."}
{"text":"The chicken tenders at Cane's is amazing. Gone many times with friends just to hang out and eat some really good chicken.  Environment here is really coo after the Devils win a mens basketball game.  The staff are also really relaxing and helpful."}
{"text":"Momma said to always count your chickens.   I don't know what that means and my momma never told me such a thing. Actually, my fingers felt like that was the thing to type. But seriously, count your chickens!   Now I'm not one to do that. I don't want to be the one car at the drive thru opening each box up for quality assurance/control. However, the past 3 visits...in which we rarely ever come here to eat...I've been jipped out of a chicken, side order of fries looks like it's under a budget cut, and I'm actually quite annoyed. Yes, I know. 1 piece of chicken. BUT! When you order your kid a kids meal and all he gets his ONE chicken when there's supposed to be two and like 9pcs of fries...seriously.  I'm not one to gripe about food, but 3x in a 9 month period being short a chicken. Kids meal short a chicken happened twice, last visit we ordered the 3pc combo. Instead, we got 2pcs so basically it was pretty much a kids meal. But what does that really mean when two out of the 3 visits our kids meal came with one. I never called to complain because I really feel silly for calling about being short a chicken, but at the end of the day...you're paying a price and you should get what you paid for.   Workers seem diligent at the drive thru window and on point, but somebody isn't counting their chickens and I'm ready to tell their momma. Just felt like typing that in too. Lol.  Whenever we pull through the next time...whenever that is... 3 strikes have been used and now I'm gonna have to count my chickens. Other than that, we all know Raising Cane's chicken isn't bad at all.   But buyer beware!"}
{"text":"This is grrrrreat I'm from Cali an a my Vegas native cousin recommend I try Canes and boy oh boy am I glad I did. We ate this 2 days in a row while out there tried the other location on flamingo 1st an it was great also same great taste and quality both times got the canes box the first time good portion I was full after the next day I got the box as well except I substituted my co-slaw for a extra Texas toast. Not a fan of slaw but there's is decent. Can't wait till one opens in Cali but so Ive heard someone bought out the rights so it cannot open in California but I'm not sure anyways if your in Vegas this is a good place to grab fresh hot food at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"Chicken strips were awesome.  My only complaint was the sauces (or lack thereof).  I didn't like the Cane sauce, and ketchup didn't do it justice.  Wishing for some BBQ or honey mustard sauce."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Thank you, Levee, for your very positive attitude. With an attitude like that, you're beneficial to any employer!"}
{"text":"Raising canes! Please open up in Los Angeles please! This is probably the best chicken fingers I've ever had. On top of that the Texas toast is orgasmic in my mouth! I can eat their toasts for months and months. If only I didn't have to travel all the way to Vegas for it.. Sigh. Something I do look for while in Vegas.  Last but not least the sweet tea. Lord oh lord! The sweet tea is bomb dot com!!!!!"}
{"text":"rafael had great service!!!! yummy food. he definitely served with a smile on his face and our food came out speedy gonzalez    i came back and tyler also has great customer service. i had a bunch of problems and questions and he answered them all. canes, keep him around!!! hes an asset to your company"}
{"text":"Not like I am a huge chicken finger connoisseur by any means but I can safely say that these are by far and away the greatest chicken fingers I've ever had. The fries suck so if I were to do it again, I would just buy the fingers and then go to Mcd's for the fries."}
{"text":"Raising Canes is one of the only fast food restaurants I'd go to when I need something cheap and quick on the way versus your usual McDonalds, Burger King, Jack In The Box, etc. The chicken there is never frozen and your order is cooked upon ordering. Their famous Cane's Sauce is made from scratch at the store and it's always perfectly consistent. For an average female, I always order the 3 Finger Combo (3 chicken fingers, a Texas toast, fries and a drink) and it's just enough to fill me up. I'm completely addicted to their sweet tea. It's a must get whenever I come here, not too sweet and no bitter or after taste. Their Texas toast is bomb! Order it butter both sides if you like it more crispy! They also have honey mustard which I occasionally replace the Cane's sauce with since I love that as well. The only downside is that their chicken fingers are a hit or miss, juicy or dry. The drive thru is usually packed and wait times can be long especially during peak times."}
{"text":"Came here because I haven't been for 5 years! I fell in love when I used to go to Las Vegas for basketball tournaments. I looooooved this place.  What I love the most? The SAUCE. It is to die for. Peppery and creamy goodness.   I ordered the Caniac combo with 20 extra sides of sauces to take home. I know you can order like a 32 oz cup of it but I thought it would be easier in the little 2 oz cups.   It tasted good. Not as good as I remember but maybe my taste buds changed or I was expecting too much?  I used to get random dreams about Canes back home! I had to come! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Sauce is the boss! Delicious! I love how I can get naked tenders, since I have to eat gluten free, and still enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Compared to other fast food places I give it 5 stars. Best chicken fingers I've ever had and the Cane's sauce is the business! The service was great. Everyone is nice, polite and helpful. Must try if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's always clean, staff is friendly and chicken fingers are the bomb."}
{"text":"Chicken was good. My girlfriend I weren't too fond of the canes sauce, it would be better if they had ranch. Overall it was pretty mediocre, we probably will not be back next time we're in vegas."}
{"text":"Only in Vegas can there be a restaurant dedicated to chicken dishes!  Their chicken fingers were quite good and for the price it was a whole lot of food.  Definitely worth the drive just off the Strip."}
{"text":"Have been there twice, I don't get it. Dry, salty, blah food, and the place is always full. This generation must have been raised on microwaved dinners to like this."}
{"text":"The kids love their food and the Cane sauce that comes with their meals.  I like the fact that they have crushed ice. I do, however, feel that they are over-priced.   It's always busy, but the kids working the drive-thru always have a pleasant attitude."}
{"text":"Went through drive through. 1st window: Asked if i can give my rewards number and he looked at me like we dont have a rewards card. I then said Caniac and it jogged his memory. Still couldnt retreive it via phone #. The person was not friendly and did not say thank you.  2nd window. I asked if extra fries were in bag, she asked for receipt, it was not added in order but instead charged for 2 extra sauce . She did not try to accommodate or at least apologize with empathy. She just said that will be $1.94.   No time to dispute as I was picking up lunch for my husband.   This could have been an isolated incident but I just need to let Canes know!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Raising Cane's from my co-worker that I thought I finally pay this place a visit on my way home from Vegas.  I ordered the Caniac Combo.  It came with a lot of fries and 6 big pieces of chicken tenders.  The Cole slaw was ok, nothing to write home about.  The fries was pretty good when it was still hot, but did not taste that great once it cooled off.  The roll was grilled with butter and tasted fresh.  The chicken tenders was pretty big and I couldn't even finish it.  I had to take half of it home.   The sweet tea was pretty good.  Not too sweet and I like that the dispenser was self serve.  Definitely would come back here when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I thought if I moved so close to a Raising Cane's that I would go here frequently, but I've only been here once in the last 5 months or so.  I'm not really crazy about the food here anymore.  Fries are a little lackluster, texas toast is so salty I feel like I've run my tongue on a salt lick, and I wish there was more than just the thousand island dressing to dip the fingers in.  A little variety would be nice.  Yes the chicken is good, but that is all I like, literally.  One more thing that bugs me - they don't really have any small plates of food.  Everything is massive.  Yes I know I could just order a la carte, but sometimes it would be nice to see a special plate with a smaller bit of food."}
{"text":"Ate here once on a lunch break from a PMP prep class I was taking.  I am not a fan of chicken fingers, but these were the best I'd ever had.  Delicious, crunchy, moist but not greasy.  Perfect."}
{"text":"The food is very good, but to me it's the sauce that brings the experience to another level.  I dip just about everything in it--the chicken strips, fries, and toast.  My only complaint is that while the chicken strips are good, they seem to have gotten smaller in the past year; so I occasionally feel like I'm not getting my money's worth."}
{"text":"Where to begin? I must say, I have been a BIG supporter of Chick-Fil-A over the years. However, Cane's chicken tenders/strips/what have you are outta this world! The portions are HUGE so the cost of under $10 for a meal like this is outrageously good. The sauce is better than any other specialty dipping sauce I have tried and the lemonade is simply the best. Even the Texas toast is the best I've ever had. It is fast food, but it doesn't truly feel like it. The staff at every Cane's I have gone to is friendly as well.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Last visit left me disappointed. I came back and am very happy. Service is excellent, food is outstanding.  When Cane's is on their game, they have some of the best chicken in Vegas."}
{"text":"C wanted chicken on his way to rehearsal so we stopped at Canes. C loves this place. Our counter girl was Stacy. She was very nice, smiled at us and greeted us as we walked in. C and I ordered the Caniac Combo ($8.79) with an additional finger ($1.29). After we placed our order we took our cups over to the beverage bar. Decent selection of Coke products plus 3 fresh brewed Tea dispensers. C and I got our drinks and found a table. The staff brings your food to you so as some have noted, for fast food, this is a plus. Our food was brought out fairly quickly. The 7 chicken fingers were good sized and very hot. You could tell they just came out of the fryer. The Texas toast was warm as were the fries. The toast tasted fine as did the slaw but the fries just had a funk to them. The closest thing I can relate them to is the fake butter taste you get on cheap movie theater popcorn. But, we weren't here for the fries. After a few minutes our chicken had cooled down and we dug in. Good stuff for sure. The chicken was seasoned right, not overly breaded and tasted great. Winner winner chicken dinner. Great staff, clean dining room, tasty chicken, vegeline tasting fries, decent slaw. 4 stars"}
{"text":"This raising cane's is absolutely amazing! In the beginning I was very upset about how long my order took. Then to make it worse they messed up my order. However, when I drove back (20mins) they exceeded expectations. The manager personally came out and handled every piece of the reorder. When I got home my family was so excited and happy!"}
{"text":"People raved about the chicken. They seemed okay but not something out of this world.  Would I have it again, maybe if nothing else was near or open."}
{"text":"Family tradition every time we are in Vegas! This place makes the best crispiest moist and tender chicken strips you will ever have! The sauce is addicting and delicious!! A must if your in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was mine and my boyfriend's first visit to this location. We were greeted as soon as we came in the door and the friendly cashiers quickly took our order.  We did not wait long for our food,  but the cashier came to our table while we were waiting and told us it would be right up. Then,  she brought it to the table.  The chicken tenders were fresh,  juicy and delicious. The cole slaw is amazing and the sauce they serve with the chicken is very good as well! This definitely lived up to the great things we have heard and we will come back."}
{"text":"Yum, hot and fresh chicken fingers with a tasty sauce. They will let you substitute another toast for those of us who aren't fond of cold slaw. They have both sweet and unsweetened ice tea; so you can add just a hint of sweet to your tea, or mellow out your sweet tea. They use a larger diameter drinking straw, than most fast food restaurants, similar to the ones at McDonalds, except Cane's are clear. My number one reason for visiting regularly is that they open at 9am, and it's frequently difficult to find restaurants serving lunch menus at that time."}
{"text":"Hmm... I don't get what the big deal is with this place?! The chicken and sauce are ordinary. I got more excited with their fries and lemonade. I guess the food here is not my cup of tea?!  The plus side is there's a drive-thru, which is very convenient."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high and maybe it was the location (according to my friend it was) but this was just okay. Nothing to rave about. I would try it again, albeit another location, but I'm not rushing to get back. The portion sizes were good and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Check your order before you leave.  My 9.52$ caniac combo only came with three tenders, and they were incredibly over fried. Not enjoyable, but still edible."}
{"text":"Great chicken tenders. Juicy and tender staff Are really nice  Reasonable prices. This is a keep coming back place :  )"}
{"text":"Are used to come here for after Football game to eat dinner with my team. The food always came out consistently man do I respect or restaurant who could serve you quickly and consistently never have I had a bad meal here at canes the fries are all Scripps the chicken tenders are obis crispy on the outside and the tenderness of the scan his mouth watering the sauce and the one of a kind sauce the secret that combines the whole flavor profile together man I enjoy cans please stop by if you've never been."}
{"text":"Little girl and manager were both rude as hell my card works fine else where and at other terminals  in thier store but they wouldn't take my payment or even enter it manually. Truly ignorant and annoying long day just wanted a quick meal. I come here all the time. That register has issues I see them swipe cards all the time a few times but I'm done with this low grade service. I will never return to this location the food has honestly gone down hill in the last few months customer service is not great eiather obviously. So I think I will just not go to canes any more. I have been going multiple times a week.. so I'm gonna just start eating cleaner anyways not this garbage thanks for opening my eyes I'm gonna pass the word along as well. ?"}
{"text":"Over priced chicken fingers.  this was my first time Here and I was not too impressed.  There were lots of teens hanging out.  The only reason I came here was out of curiosity... doubt I will be back"}
{"text":"Is is possible to award 5 stars to a fried chicken place...? Hellayeah it is...!!! I'm from the south, TEXAS and listen, we know about fried chicken. These guys know their stuff. Succulent slow marinated QUALITY chicken meat lightly fried to perfection, Texas toast, french fries and cold slaw (although the slaw would get 2 stars) Sweet tea and lemonade... seriously what more could you ask for..."}
{"text":"Ultra fantastic service and great quality food here with manager Mike...! Had a big order and Mike took care of all the details perfectly."}
{"text":"Our first time time here, and food was okay, probably better if it was fresh ( drive thu was the I my option) cole slaw was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is really clean and the service is got to be one of the best around.  Fried chicken is different in a good way.  It is flavorful but not heavy.  The fries, cole slaw, and Texas toast that accompanies the meal are all very good.  They have sweet tea and ice tea.  Again, very good flavor for both.  They have a sauce that compliments their chicken and fries."}
{"text":"The food is always Raising Cane's good.  Always great service, what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"+ Great chicken tenders  + Sauce makes it 5x better + Bread is GREAT + Their combo is perfect  Every time I'm in Vegas, I try to make an effort to come and visit this place. It's something different from the usual Popeyes/Church's/etc. Their chicken tenders are soft and retain a lot of flavor, matched up with the bread and fries. Also, don't forget to dip it into their crack sauce, it's really good.  Service was great, and the establishment is kept clean. This is probably fast food done right. If they had one in Southern California, I'd probably be there many times out of the year. Overall, can't say much other than 5/5 wood eat here again..time and time again."}
{"text":"The chicken was so fresh and tasty. I wasn't a fan of their special sauce, it tasted A little much like herbs. It was a little cramped in the place but the overall experience was good."}
{"text":"LUH me some Cane's whenever I visit my good friends in Gilbert. This location on Val Vista is nice. I wish we had one near where I live in the Los Angeles area. I luh the chicken fingers. I luh the Cane's sauce. I luh the sweet tea. I luh the crinkle cut fries.   We decided to come here after the Lantern Festival in Queen Creek and were all super hungry. I got the Caniac Combo to share. In fact, we ordered several Caniac Combos to share amongst our group. The Caniac comes with 6 chicken fingers, crinkle cut fries, 2 Cane's sauces, cole slaw, a large drink and a texas toast. The chicken is tasty, the sauce is great, the sweet tea was good, the fries were just ok. Good stuff. Everyone enjoyed the food.  Customer service especially from the young lady at the register was very nice. Pay at the counter, your name will be called and your tray brought to you. All the staff were super nice. I will for sure be back the next time I'm in town. Cane's!"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick bite of chicken & texas toast in Gilbert.... I had always seen Raising Cane's in Las Vegas but never did get around to eating there. Finally on my 2nd trip to Arizona, I was able to see what the fuss is all about. I was quite satisfied.  I got the 3-piece chicken combo with crinkle cut fries & texas toast. I substituted the cole slaw for another piece of that damn great cheese toast. Loved it... The chicken pieces were good, especially dipping them in that cane's sauce. The fries were good. I was dipping some of those crinkle cut fries in the cane's sauce too. Make sure you order extra. And yes, they do charge for them. I loved the bread, like I said and I dipped that too in the cane's sauce. Everything was good and tasty. The food wasnt too greasy. I wish we had Raisin Cane's in LA. It would do well & kill it IMO... Gotta have the sweet tea. I love me some sweet tea and free refills on that goodness?? Game over. It's the cherry on top. Get it!"}
{"text":"So, I have been to a Raising Cane's on two separate occasions now... and I'm still on the fence on whether I'm a fan or it's just A-OK.  However, I enjoyed the chicken fingers at this particular location more than I enjoyed them on my prior experience at another location, so I'm going to give them the extra star.  The GOOD... the chicken (at this location) has a lot of flavor and is seemingly made to order as mine came out hot and juicy.  I'd even go so far as to say that the chicken fingers/strips are better than those Chick-Fil-A.  The NOT-SO-GOOD... when my chicken fingers came out, I asked if they had any sauce to go with my chicken AND THEN... she looked at me for a moment and then looked at the line of people waiting to order... and then looked at me again... and then finally said, \"Yes, but it costs $.29.\"  I responded and said, \"that's fine, I don't mind paying.\"  Then she said, \"and we have hot sauce that is free.\"  I took that hesitation and entire exchange as meaning that she was not sure if she should make me wait in that line for a packet of sauce for $.29 or take me ahead of other people who were already waiting.    This entire awkward exchange could have been avoided if the individual who rang me up had asked if I would like any sauce with my chicken.  Or, since they had the long line, the girl I had my exchange with could have just handed me a free sauce that day and told me to be sure to order it along with my chicken next time.  Anyway, I had recently learned that hot sauce and ketchup mixed together is actually a pretty tasty dip for fried chicken, so I opted to go that route rather than let my chicken get cold while waiting to order a packet of sauce.  I guess I'm still at beginner level when it comes to this place... but I'll probably give them another chance.  ****FOUR STARS****"}
{"text":"A good clean fast place to go especially for lunch.  I always get the box with chx, toast, fries, slaw and sauce.  They keep it simple with \"one love\"  not trying to serve everything in an inexpensive fast food restaurant.  I know very few people that dont care for Canes but they are the same ones who like and or review Subway, Wendys and BK...too funny."}
{"text":"Garlic Toast is really good  and perfectly cooked every time and the chicken is never greasy and is great when dipped in the special sauce also the sweet tea is good a little to sweet for me so we mix half sweet and half unsweet and it comes out perfect"}
{"text":"I love their chicken it so good with the cold slaw and garlic bread it's so good you have to try it"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place out I've always heard of it from my friends in Atlanta so when I saw that there was one in Vegas I had to try it out. The interior of this place was clean the people were nice and attentive just overall a nice place to take your family for lunch or dinner. Now to the food its self, all I can is that it was amazing the chicken strips were great the fries were crispy, the Texas toast tasted great the Cole slaw was on point but what really topped everything was there special sauce I absolutely loved it it gave the chicken a kick and really tasted like no other special sauce I've ever had. Overall when I ever I come back to Vegas I'm always stopping by this place"}
{"text":"This is the only Raising Canes I've been to and the food is always great and fresh. The only bad thing is how crowded the parking lot can get. We always get some honey mustard since I prefer it over the cane sauce."}
{"text":"We visited right before lunch and was greeted right away at the speaker by a friendly and up-beat employee. Service was super quick from start to finish. To top it all off, our food was absolutely fresh! Parking lot and drive thru lane were spotlessly clean."}
{"text":"Today I had my first taste of Cane's chicken fingers in Las Vegas and it was amazing!  The chicken, fries, coleslaw, and toast tasted so good and so fresh!  I would not call this fast food my any means.  The prices are very reasonable and the quality is great! Love the vibe and the happy employees!  Definitely a place to visit if you want great chicken!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy this place and this location has some of the fun-est friendlies staff ever, they actually seem to enjoy their job and it shows.    Stopped here while we were next door at tropical cafe for a geocaching event (google geocaching if you're wondering, we're a fun crazy group..well some of us are) and decided instead of eating there we will indulge in some of the AWESOME dip sauce.  Chicken strips are always crispy on the outside and juicy in the center, our only complaint is the bread wasn't as delightful as normal just a bit greasy."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get chicken tenders and fries. They have a special sauce and the Texas toast is a favorite of my son's. It get pretty busy, but so worth it."}
{"text":"I like this place. A little pricey. But it is way better than the other typical fried chicken places. The chicken looked like chicken and tasted like it too. Closes commercial chicken you will get if you dont want to make it yourself."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the 10 year old boy still in me but I LOVE chicken fingers! The thought of a restaurant dedicated solely to chicken fingers lead me to believe they MUST have perfected the art of amazing chicken fingers?  So I thought.  Went to the counter and was really surprised how small the menu is- it's tenders and a few sides, that's it!! Order the 3-tender basket which includes fries and some toast or bread. Asked for ranch STOP we only have our Cane Sauce. BUT I want ranch I exclaimed! We only have our Cane Sauce. and so on... Got my drink, by the time my drink was filled the guy from the counter was behind me with my basket in hand before I could even find a seat.   Fingers - so the chicken fingers themselves were breaded, moist and tender, not greasy at all, however I felt they could be a little more crisp... They were much smaller than the ones in the picture at the store and web site.  Fries - I don't normally eat fries. Don't get me wrong I like fries, I just avoid the carbs so If they were really good I would have eaten them. These were SOGGY, old-school crinkle cut fries!! The place sells chicken fingers and fries. WHY NOT MAKE AMAZING HOMEMADE FRIES? Why not do what the belgians do - cut 'em fresh, fry 'em TWICE (two different temperatures) and make them amazing? These were SOGGY. I would rather eat fries from Wendy's or even McDonalds.  Decore - Very nicely laid out, modern looking store. They spent some money on the place, it's evident.   BOTTOM LINE: If you are going to be a specialty store, you had better ROCK the few menu items you make. It'l be interesting if you are around in a few years."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating Raising Cane's... not a big fan of fried chicken. (yes, I'm Black)Lmao:) But I must say this stuff is so friggin' good. I ordered a #1 box combo with four chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, lemonade and toast. The toast was almost better than the chicken. It came with some sort of dipping sauce, not sure what it was but it made the chicken a whole lot better. The staff was really excited... Even the girl moping was smiling ear to ear. I'll probably come back on another cheat day."}
{"text":"This is the best experience I've ever had at Cane's. Eric was fantastic! He made our friends first visit amazing. The staff was so personable, the restaurant was clean, and the food was, of course, delicious."}
{"text":"I am staying in Las Vegas on the strip.  I grow weary of buffet foods and went on to Yelp to find something new and different that was off the strip.  Based on what I read I went to Raising Cane.    This place is a fast food format restaurant that serves chicken fingers, fries, and texas toast.  The food was very good, and the service was fast.  I now have a happy full stomach.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was told Raising Cane's had the best chicken, as it was really moist. The were right. They have the best chicken strips I have ever had. My wife and I really enjoyed the meal. The servers were friendly too."}
{"text":"Impressive for a soft opening!  Parking is tough, not sure the parking lot will be big enough.  Ordered 4 piece combo. Took awhile to appear at the table but understandable.  Food was hot and very tasty!  Problems I felt was very cold and it is very loud. It was maybe 1/2 full at 6:15 and we could not hear ourselves talk :(   Since they call your name for ypur order it makes it very hard because we could not hear our name called. Not sure what can be done about that.  We will be back so please look for an update ;)"}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders I've had in a fast food environment. These are restaurant quality strips. The fries are like Del Tacos but fresher. The Sweat Tea is delicious and refreshing."}
{"text":"I liked this place so much I went two days in a row... :)  The staff was definitely friendly both visits. Saturday morning it was a little slower, but that just meant that I got extra attention from the staff.   The chicken was outstanding! And loved the Texas Toast that came with my order.   Welcome addition to our neighborhood. (I'm pretty sure my hubby goes through their Drive-Thru often.)"}
{"text":"Went Yelping for a quick cheap bite since it doesn't seem to exist on the Las Vegas strip. This place came up and me and my boyfriend went for it. Definitely no regrets there. Here's why: -There was a line but it moved quick. -Orders came out speedy quick as well. -Toast-- Yum for bread lovers. The slight sweetness of it really offsets everything else. -Chicken-- Pretty damn good for chicken fingers! Lightly battered, crispy, and moist. Made the fries an \"ehh\" for me. And I love me some fries. Oh and I almost forgot about the coleslaw. Cuz it really didn't need to be there for me. -And it doesn't even burn a hole in your wallet. Definitely a revisit whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of coming here because the line at the nearby In n' Out was long. Bad food. Dry chicken, bad sauce didn't help. Toast of some kind didn't help either. Bread was soggy, french fries were soggy and were obviously the previously frozen kind that had been re-fried and left under a heat lamp for at least an hour (they tasted awful). The best thing about the meal was the ketchup...per-packaged Heinz ketchup. Don't waste your time or money here. If  In n' Out is busy, try the Wendy's across the street on Lake Mead.  Yuck"}
{"text":"The chicken is 5 star The sweet tea is 5 star The Texas toast is 5 star The Cain sauce is 3 star. The fact it is Cain sauce or nothing is horrible. Start offering Ranch Dressing. The fries are 3 star. Much better elsewhere. Overall 4 stars. Good place/good value."}
{"text":"I was excited to go to a place that specialized in chicken strips.  I love chicken strips so I was thinking this would be like the In and Out Burger of chicken strips- simplified menu for an amazing food product.  Not the case.  It's average or even below average chicken strips and fries for not a great price. I think Wendy's, Jack and the Box and Denny's have better chicken strips.  The sauce was strange tasting too.  If you really want good chicken strips try Four Peaks chicken strips.  Amazing."}
{"text":".., probably the best chicken strips I've had to this day. A new must stop whenever in Vegas thanks to Adam & Mia!  Combos come with fries, Texas toast & their delicious dipping sauce. Damn good sweet tea & friendly service. We'll be back!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a simple Chicken Finger meal....... It had great fry's - dipping sauce- and fantastic service...... With all the fast food places around this place  really know how to treat a customer rights.  Great tasting food too ,"}
{"text":"Food was great! Even the husband loved it, and he hates everything! Parking lot was too small and too chaotic. The noise level was way too high. Can't hardly hear your party.  The dining room was too cold!  When people are wearing jackets and its 100 degrees outside, that might tell you its too cold, and hard to enjoy your meal. I'm still giving 5 stars because of the food.  Work on the air temperature!"}
{"text":"My review is based on the lack of attentiveness from staff. I have been coming here on and off since opened. Food is decent. I will give them credit for doing one thing and one thing well. Every time I come here I always order unsweet iced tea. Every time they give me sweet tea. It really bothers me that they can't follow a simple order. Now every time I take a sip to make sure it's not sweet tea and time and time again it's sweet tea. I called the manager the second to last time I was there and this occurred and her response to me was, \"as a diabetic I understand that it is important to get the order right and you can't have the sugar\". First off, who the heck said I was diabetic????? Why is management assuming that someone is diabetic because they order unsweet iced tea???? Maybe the three or four people working the drive thru window should spend more time reviewing an order to make sure it's accurate instead of joking around and not really working. Just a thought."}
{"text":"Mike is managing this store very well. The venue was clean and the chicken was delivered steaming hot! He and his staff had checked on our table multiple times during our lunch. This kind of service does not go unnoticed."}
{"text":"04/02/16 this is rediculous I been going to canes for a while now way before the Tropicana location opened up and it just seems like this location is just really damn slow I don't know what it is my time is way smoother at the last Vegas Blvd location the food is great but this location is horrible...."}
{"text":"Sorry ass place i can go to any other canes and use my fucking card but i come to this sorry ass place and have a fucking problem if your gunna run a fucking business run them all the fuck the same my god...."}
{"text":"Although I first had Raising Cane's in California, the food always taste better in Nevada. Raising Cane's specializes in chicken tender and they do it well. The food is always fresh, hot, and crispy. I'm not a fan of their dipping sauce but everyone I know can't get enough of it.  I really like the ice pebbles for their drinks, I just feel it makes the drinks taste better and it's fun to chew on. I'm not a fan of their cold slaw but they allow you to substitute any side at no charge. I always get double toast. This location is fairly new (under 1 year from this review) and its incredibly clean and constantly maintained by the staff. I recommend going inside the restaurant to order, even for take out, because the drive thru line is usually really long"}
{"text":"It's good but WAY too expensive for what you get.  The 'box' combo is 7 bucks and consists of 4 chicken fingers, fries and a biscuit. Why do places like this always push the 6-7 dollar meal? How about a box (no meal) with ten chicken fingers, instead of 25 or 50?? I'd pay nine-ten bucks for that.  The fries are crinkle cut variety. They really don't belong at a 2011 chain like this one - but in a value bag at Family Dollar. The chicken is good but nothing crazy. It's better than most chains, but I prefer Popeye's. This place is alright but the fast food market in Phoenix is now saturated with these boring, bland chains. Dean's review is spot-on."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place was disappointing. I was expecting the greatest chicken tenders ever and it was the complete opposite.   Chicken tenders has that crispy and crunchy texture on the outside, with the juicy meat, however, that's just it. There's no seasoning and it was very bland. I was later told by another customer who dines there regularly that Raising Cane is known for their Cajun dipping sauce. Meh. I prefer it on the chicken.   The restaurant is pretty small and fills up quick! It's busy, but I wouldn't wait for this chicken. The sauce isn't spectacular so I may not come back."}
{"text":"Normally when I think of chicken fingers, I think of over-battered insipid dried pieces of chicken just short of reaching jerky status.  And this is for the chicken fingers that I considered pretty decent.  Raising Cane's chicken fingers completely shattered all my preconceived notions of what great chicken fingers were.  So moist and hot, they should come with a disclaimer, as the hot steam escaping from your first bite will surely burn you.  I doubt that one can even find chicken fingers so good in a sit-down restaurant setting.  The dipping sauce that it comes with is ok, akin to a peppery mayonnaise, but left me wishing that I had one of those little travel size Tabasco sauces.  Next time I will get it to-go or bring my own sauce.  All of this for a price that even a college student would consider a bargain."}
{"text":"Man people love chicken fingers and that thousand island sauce. I admit I do too, it's always busy so avoid rush hours during lunch.  Their parking is small and there are always cars wrapped around the building.  Ice tea is awesome but a little on the sweeter side for me.   I'm glad I don't live near here since I'd come here all the time."}
{"text":"While I'm not big on fast-food, Raising Cane's is my fav in that category.  I've been to almost all of RC's locations, this was my first visit to the newly opened Henderson location.    I took my two little ones for a quick dinner on a Saturday evening. As you can imagine, it was busy. Not packed, but definitely a good amount of traffic. Staff was extremely friendly from the moment we walked in.  When our food arrived, we were advised that they gave us an extra chicken each because they were small pieces. Nice surprise! Thoughtful.. When does that ever happen in a fast food restaurant? Never!!   While we were eating, I noticed staff continually going around, cleaning up, asking if everything was okay with our meals, etc.. honestly at one point I thought- is this fast food, or a full service restaurant?? I have to say I was already impressed when the  GM stopped at our table moments later to ask how our experience was. He introduced himself and we had a nice little chat about the newly opened location.   I'm really impressed with the experience we had at this new Henderson location. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place and the reviews were stellar so on my last trip to Vegas I decided to give them a shot. For fast food it is good, but there are a million bars and restaurants that have better chicken fingers.   I will say that the chicken itself was very moist, tender and juicy. They get credit (and the 3rd star) for that. Unfortunately the breading was very bland and tasteless and the sauce was only okay.  Be prepared, the ONLY thing this place sells is chicken fingers and a chicken sandwich made from chicken fingers. So if you are eating with someone who might want a burger or something else you will need to go elsewhere.  I was quite disappointed that they didn't appear to have a selection of sauces. I would have preferred a good BBQ sauce to their Canes Sauce, but considering the lack of options on their menu I guess their business plan is to tell people what to eat rather than let them decide what they want for themselves.  Again, not bad I guess for fast food, definitely better than the chicken strips at Burger King or Jack-in-the-Box (not that the bar there is set that high) but if you really want good chicken fingers you can do much better."}
{"text":"Really bland, you have to use the sauce. Chick-fil-a blows them out of the water. If you are looking for quantity over quality then this is the place for you"}
{"text":"This place is really expensive for chicken fingers. They sell chicken fingers, fries, toast and coleslaw... that's it.   All these 5 star reviews must be from Californians who are deprived of food that doesn't taste like absolutely nothing. California = the land of no seasoning; I would know, I lived there for 10 years. These reviews can not be trusted. Yeah, I said it.   Their special sauce sorta tastes like paprika, salt, pepper, and mayonnaise? The honey mustard is decent. They charge $.50 for it but the first time I went the guy behind the counter gave me some for free.   The fries are horrid. They're like the Ore-ida frozen crinkle cut fries. The chicken is good but it tastes exactly like what my mom and I  make at home from scratch for pennies. Homemade is ALWAYS better.   I would love it if they served their food in something more biodegradeable; eat-in orders are even served in styrofoam takeout containers that are never gonna break down. :-(   They need to lower their prices, a couple chicken fingers, frozen fries and toast isn't worth like $7+"}
{"text":"Expect nothing but greatness from this location. The service is extremely fast and the food comes out blazing hot! I always get the three finger combo and it never fails. I suggest ordering an extra side of the fry sauce because it's way too good to only have one. The order comes with a side of Texas toast which is buttery and warm. I'm also a huge fan of the crushed ice this place uses. It makes any soda taste 1000 times better."}
{"text":"They do it right here.   Definitely a guilty pleasure, so when I come here I go all out!   Go Caniac, full-out, from the start. Don't mess around with all that other stuff. Trade your coleslaw for another \"fancy sauce\" (I don't know what they call it but Dale and Brennan call it fancy sauce), and dive in! The sweet tea is great with the salty, peppery sauce and chicken.   Another great perk to this place is the 20% off for military or veterans (and I am sure officers). Helps a lot, and lets me get 20% more FOOOOOD!!!!  I have been to this location probably 7-8 times since it opened and never had a bad experience; not even anything close to a bad experience. They are always properly staffed, stocked and clean. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Very good food.   The service was quick and good.   The place was pretty busy and chaotic.   The location was a little too small for how many  people were there."}
{"text":"Very good chicken and toast Wish they would carry a box combo with no drink,there sauce is amazing i want to put it on everything, toast is made with garlic and very good.With the limited menu i guess you have to do it right or you wont last long.There mascot golden retreiver is super cute too."}
{"text":"I love this place. Chicken fingers are one of my favorites! I frequent this location, however, this last visit has left me wondering if I should go the extra mile to the St. Rose location. To have to repeat your order five or six times and for it to still come out wrong, seems something may have changed here and unfortunately not for the better."}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego and one week later, I'm still craving Raising Cane's!!  This fast food joint had a lot of people around lunch, but we still managed to get a table and my food pretty quick.   Ordered the CANIAC COMBO which has 6 chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, Texas toast, 2 cane sauces, and a large sweet tea. I split it with my friend, so we had to order an extra toast. The food was amazing!! The sweet tea tastes exactly like McDonald's sweet tea....still refreshing. The chicken fingers and toast were ON POINT.  The service was just as great as the food. Each employee had a smile on their face and were never hesitant when I asked for something.  Definitely a place to eat when you want something different and fast, especially if you're not from Vegas. Great place to eat right before heading home...can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This place has gone down in customer service and the amount of food they give. I came here tonight and got 2, 3 finger combos and both of them has almost no fries that came with is. Are you guys rationing?"}
{"text":"I was hangry for chicken strips but hubby didn't want anything here so I decided it was just easier to go through the drive thru. They had forgitabotthat cole slaw & crinkle cut fries that needed ketchup badly. Regrettably I said no:(  When I bit into that Texas toast it was gone in a few seconds! It was so yummylicious! I wished I had seconds on that toast! The chicken strips were actually very delicious. Not heavily battered or greasy. The flavors were yummy, juicy & tasty. Making me want more but my eyes are always bigger than my tummy. I could only eat 2 & saved the other 2 for the next day!  Try it bc you will be pleasantly surprised! Normally I'm a true fan of CFA that I have to admit this Raising Cane's chicken strips were just as good if not better. Did I really say that? They gave us sauce that looked like thousand island but I'm guessing it was RC's signature sauce. I tried it & liked that too. I'm sure I'll be back one day as it's not a chain here in Northern California yet! Too many CFAs in town! LOL   It was so convenient right there by the Las Vegas South Premium outlets! Not far from our hotel! Hubby noticed that all they do are chicken strips. Very minimalistic menu. I faintly remembered hubby asking if they do soup but nope! I see they are located in Reno Nevada & Southern California. Either way that's a long drive! I'm patient in this case! Hehehehe!"}
{"text":"*Customer Service 1/2 Stars, Average customer service here. Have been here multiple times and it's good but nobody goes out of their way for anything to make it premier.   *Experience 1/1 Star, No issues so far when going here and of the times I e been here it's not overly crowded like all of the other Raising Cane's locations I've been to so that's always a plus.   *Food 1/1 Star, Raising Cane's is by far the best fast food Chicken fingers you can get here in Arizona and it's also a plus that you can get everything extra crispy by simply asking when you order! To top it all off their Texas toast is like the icing on the cake, simply amazing!  *Would I Recommend 1/1 Star, Would absolutely recommend, especially if you haven't ever been here before. If you love Chicken fingers I can promise you won't be disappointed in Raising Cane's."}
{"text":"This is a great example of good fast food: the chicken is well cooked and pulls apart easily and the fry is light and not too greasy. I'm not a fan of crinkle fries but these were good and went well with the signature Cane's sauce (a thousand islands-esque mayo sauce). Their lemonade and sweet tea are both super refreshing and the food is filling and affordable. I didn't like the Texas toast but would definitely go back for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I love Canes!!!! They have great customer service, the food always comes out piping hut and fresh, and LOVE that they have a drive thru."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a negative star.  I went there twice hoping the second time would be better.  The chicken is extremely plain.  It tastes like it was boiled and breaded.  No spices what so ever.  And their so called \"Texas garlic toast\" was no more then a soggy piece of bread which had no garlic what so ever.  Just lightly buttered.  I did like their sauce so because it actually made the chicken have some flavor.  I believe that's why they give you alot of sauce with your meal because they know their chicken is horrible.  I will never come back again, EVER!!! Save your money for a better place like Popeyes, which is 1000 times better."}
{"text":"Love this place but they are a little overpriced!!! The sauce is what makes the chicken taste even better! Raising canes is fab. 4 stars due to prices!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken fingers and the toast from here. Their dipping sauce for the chicken is delicious and you definitely need it for the chicken fingers. Delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"If you don't like chicken fingers, you aren't going to like this place.   Fortunately, I do. The chicken was moist and flavorful, with batter that wasn't greasy at all. The Texas toast was perfectly toasted and didn't have that weird microwave popcorn taste. Fries are crisp and taste really good too.  The sweet tea was excellent.   Clean restaurant, quick service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Something different for a change.  I love that their focus is solely on chicken fingers.  The service is always friendly and the drive thru peeps are upbeat.  However, I can't give more than 3 stars.  You would think that a place that specializes only in chicken fingers and boasts that they are never frozen would really blow you away. But Raising Cane's just doesn't do that for me.  The menu is simple, which is great.  I usually get the most popular meal \"The Box,\" which comes with 4 chicken fingers, fries, cole slaw, texas toast and their special dipping sauce (which is the best part of the meal, IMO).  I like my chicken fingers to have a crisp coating, and these just fall short.  They were almost soggy, and I just wasn't impressed (I've eaten here before and I don't remember having any complaints, so maybe their quality has just gone down over the last couple years).  The fries are nothing spectacular.  They are crinkle cut, and I think I've had better from Ore-Ida.  I find the cole slaw to be tasteless. Same goes for the texas toast.  Yes, it is toasty, but I just don't think it had a lot of flavor.  The dipping sauce and sweet tea are really the only things that save this meal for me.  If I could bottle that sauce, I would.  Also, the sweet tea is refreshing and delicious.  Although, I figure it's pretty hard to screw up sweet tea.  I also think that they are a bit overpriced.  I was there a couple of days ago and 2 meals cost $16.  That's just crazy!  I will keep them at 3 stars because of the service."}
{"text":"First time at raising cane's chicken spot. Visiting Phoenix area and everyone claims this is the place for fried chicken so we visit d the spot so I can try it out. I have to say I was impressed with the layout and how fast they move their product. The chicken was really good with most of the flavor from the sauce. The fries are basic at best and the sauce helps keep them at par. For a fast food joint I would say their fried chicken is really good and wouldn't mind having more, but I would leave the fries out. I had their Cole slaw and Texas toast and that was pretty good. Unfortunately they do not have one close in my neighborhood so it will be awhile before I visit another cane's chicken."}
{"text":"Cane's is my favorite chicken finger spot in AZ. Chicken fingers are great, fries are fine, Cane's sauce is addicting and the Texas Toast and sweet tea combo is a must. 10/10 would eat again."}
{"text":"Like it!  Simple menu and fast service are a good start.  Meals all seem to be a pretty good value for what you receive.  The fingers were fresh & tasty, fries & slaw also very good.  Didn't have that \"I ate a greasy fried lunch\" feeling an hour later, like some fried stuff will do to you.. that's a huge plus.  Not quite to the high standard of the now-defunct Rock & Roll Fingers, but close.  A solid 4 stars, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A guy in the bathroom offered to sell me cocaine and I said \"no thanks breh, there's enough of it in the Cane's sauce.\"  Okay I didn't say that, but the first part was real, and I love Raising Cane's."}
{"text":"Good food but nothing too special.  The sauce is pretty delish.  I have to say the customer service is def outstanding.  I would eat there again but it isn't something that I would be dying to eat."}
{"text":"I just wish my chicken was more fresh and hot. But service was really good and they're tables are almost always clean. Solid food, they toast is so bomb"}
{"text":"I totally got fooled by all the Yelp reviews! I absolutely LOVE chicken strips and usually am not picky about them but Raising Cane's chicken sucks. It was probably one of the worst chicken strips I've ever had. Fries were just whatever too. Also we used the drive thru and specifically asked for no Texas toast on any of our orders and to replace it with other sides. We confirmed this at the window, and of course we all got double Texas toast. Pretty ridiculous. Also they don't have ranch or bbq sauce so you're forced to eat the chicken with their house sauce or ketchup. Basically if you like chicken strips...don't go here."}
{"text":"If your looking for something fast and taste great. Then Raising Canes is for you. The chicken fingers are the best and the Texas toast is the perfect side."}
{"text":"We have used this location multiple times for corporate catering.  The food arrives on time and hot, EVERY TIME.  Our employees and guests love the food.  Chicken fingers, fries, slaw and Texas Toast.  Make sure to order the Sweet Tea.  I have also given out gift certificates to technicians as a reward for a job well done.  They loved it!"}
{"text":"Went to the new Shea location! Hey, it's a hit at our house although the server did not know where Canes originated Hello! Shouldn't the staff know that.  But the food is really terrific.  The chicken was so tasty and tender and deliciously crunchy with great breading.  The Texas bread is a big deal because everyone loved it.  The Cole slaw, would like more! The fries OK.  We' real so glad and welcome to Scottsdale!! Joshua knew everything I wanted to know and was amazing.  He even shook my hand.  He knows what a great place he works at.  Thank you Cane's.  I can't wait to come back for more.  One thing, could you offer a dessert?"}
{"text":"I've had good experiances every time ive gone, its a little pricey but worth the price for their chicken and sauce. The drive through is ALWAYS busy, but if you go inside, you can get your food pretty quick. Along with that if it's busy you know your food will be hot and tasty :D."}
{"text":"My bro has been telling me to check out this fast food joint in Vegas for a long time. We ended up trying this place cause I was still away from dinnertime with the group but was a little bit hungry. Luckily, it was really close to the ATM stop that we needed to go to before reaching Vegas.   I ended up ordering the caniac combo. It came with 6 chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, Texas toast, and a large drink. The chicken fingers were juicy and hot when I received it. I ended up making small chicken sandwiches. Pieces of bread with the chicken and some coleslaw was really tasty together.   Overall, good deal for a fast meal."}
{"text":"Favorite fast food place in town honestly. Food is delicious, customer service is great, and the atmosphere inside is very pleasant. Highly recommend eating out here if you're looking for a fast and tasty meal"}
{"text":"Very good for fast food chicken. Completely different than other chain fast food chicken jojnts. All boneless and never greasy. You may have to wait a moment for your food because it is cooked to order but it is worth the few extra  moments"}
{"text":"I love Raising Cane's.  I probably eat here once a week.   I'll tell ya why they're great: 1) They're fast 2) They're hella cheap 3) The food is great  4) They give a military discount  I stopped by yesterday 6-7-15 around 2PM for a sandwich combo for $5.89.  The chicken strips were hot, juicy, and crispy. The bread was fresh.  The fries were hot, crispy, and salty.  You can't go wrong with this place.  They are consistently awesome."}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders. Lemonade is great . Fries are the best and the Texas toast. Nice friendly. But the chicken is never frozen. Very tender . Yummy place . Found it going to Tommys next door and decided to try it. Wow. No more kfc for me . At least for now. It's definitely special chicken"}
{"text":"So yummy! Always have to make an effort to stop here when in Vegas. Without even stopping by the strip or our hotel yet, we came straight here right after exiting the freeway after a 6 hour drive waiting to fill our hungry stomachs with chicken. Perfect meal to start or end your Vegas weekend.  I got the box combo. The chicken was fresh, still steaming and made to order, and super tender and crispy. The sweet tea is a must! I also love the bread. So glad my friend didn't want it so I could have a second slice. It's buttery and perfectly toasted on the outside, and soft and warm on the inside. I opted for the box combo since it has coleslaw included. Makes for a nice fresh touch when mostly everything on the plate is fried. And of course as everyone's already mentioned, the sauce is great.  You definitely get your money's worth! Not expensive at all and you'll most likely be taking a box to go for your leftovers. A sure go to next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great service! And of course the food never disappoints! It's a must whenever I'm in Vegas. Can't wait for Raising Cane's to make an appearance in SoCal!  The workers are really friendly. Our group noticed a family was leaving, and before we sat down a worker kindly wiped the table clean for us before we sat. After we were done eating another worker cleared our table as we sat and chilled a bit before we left."}
{"text":"I agree with Daniel D.  EVERY TIME I'M IN VEGAS - I'VE GOT TO GO TO RAISING CANE'S!!  enough said!! everything here is great!!!"}
{"text":"I love Raising Canes. Another great consistent fast food place. I was here on Saturday night around 9 and this place was empty. First time I'd ever seen a canes empty. It was nice because we didn't wait long at all for our food. I ordered the 3 finger combo and my bf ordered the 6 finger combo. My favorite part is enjoying the Texas toast with my chicken fingers. The fingers are lightly breaded and so tender! One serving of the sauce isn't enough for me so I had to go back and order 2 more. Sucks I had to pay for them but they were 30 cents each. Worth the cents! Haha this location is great because it's finally on my side of town!!"}
{"text":"I had a late night craving for chicken and searched for a restaurant.  This was my first time at this diner. Both the parking lot and restaurant's interior were very clean.  I didn't check out the bathrooms. I was disappointed that this place only sells chicken fingers, very few sides and NO desserts.  .  what few choices were left, were also pricey.  I ordered the sandwich for my daughter and 3 chicken finger combo for myself.  While the chicken tasted like \"real\" chicken, it lacked the seasoning I'm used to and had more breading than meat for me.  The cole slaw was kinda off, but the fries were on da money.    Nevertheless, I won't be eating here again, as I was looking for chicken pieces not tenders."}
{"text":"How do they make the chicken here?  I always assumed it was magic because I have never had a bad chicken strip here. The consistency in the chicken is superb. It's always very moist. The menu is basically Chicken strips, more chicken strips, and a chicken strip burger. You won't find variety here unfortunately. The Texas Toast that they have here is also very good and very popular. It's a big, fat, soft, buttered piece of toast they provide with every meal (except the kids meal, and the burger, I believe). The french fries are nothing too special and the coleslaw is decent, although I always tend to substitute it for an extra piece of toast at no extra charge! I believe the sweet tea and lemonade is made in-house and very good. I don't remember the last time I haven't had the sweet tea here.  With this location in particular, you may find it VERY packed if you come at the wrong time. I believe since it's closest to the strip, and a lot of tourists have heard about this place. You might be waiting a while and scouting for a table. They have a drive through, but you might be waiting a bit as well if the line gets pretty long.  Prices are fairly reasonable, ranging from $7-$10 depending on how many chicken strips you want and how big the drink is with the combo.  I would stop and try this if you haven't been to a Canes before. This is a big favorite for locals here in Las Vegas. Everybody that I bring here for their first time ends up being addicted and finds themselves back here sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Great food but lousy service. 5 different people had ordered after me but received their food before me."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious!!  I always know what to expect when I eat at Canes!   I especially love the sweet tea!   This restaurant in particular has a great staff and quick service!"}
{"text":"Best customer service from the cashier to the associates that clean the tables. Top notch service you can tell all associates love their jobs"}
{"text":"This trip to Cane's was a little disappointing, as the chicken strips were a little overdone, thus making them a little too dry. To make up for it all though the drive-thru service was great, all very friendly, unlike the standard non-patient drive-thru attendants. Not to mention they give your dog a treat if you have them in the car with you."}
{"text":"First off, I have had better chicken fingers elsewhere. I've had better fries, sweet tea, and everything else this place serves.   However.  Cane's puts it all together and pairs it with this SAUCE that I'm sure is just Thousand Island with some black pepper but It makes everything taste better. But then again that is the major flaw of Canes as well in that It needs this sauce to really cross the threshold of beyond \"average\" because without the sauce, the chicken fingers are quite bland and have very little flavor (tasting somewhat like Church's Chicken) despite being juicy and fresh-cooked to order.  The Texas Toast is what does it for me though. I love that bread and it's perfectly grilled every time! The Fries are average fries, there to look pretty and munch on after you are done with the toast and chicken.  The price is right though and the service is fast. Can't complain too much about this place, and the ambiance of the actual restaurant is good for just sitting and conversations.    And the mascot is a DOG WITH SUNGLASSES so that bumps the star count to 5"}
{"text":"Good food, they just take a while to get your order. This location is very busy. The customer service is okay, they aren't rude but aren't exactly welcoming."}
{"text":"This location isn't the best kept, but the food seems to always be decent.  My boyfriend is a regular here now. They even know him by name.  I always get the three finger combo which comes with: Texas toast, three strips, fries, drink, and one Cane's sauce.  I recommend getting extra Cane's sauce because the amount they give you is NOT enough."}
{"text":"Ok let me just start by pointing out that I'm from south Georgia. That being said, you can find almost anything here in Vegas. But up until now we have not found good sweet tea anywhere, until we came here. It's awesome.  This place reminds me a lot of zaxbys (a chicken chain on the east coast)  The menu is really simple, the food is really good, the tea is really sweet, and the sauce is amazing!  Not to mention this place has the best customer service of anywhere. Yea yea some of the reviews were complaining about having sugar in the bottom of their sweet tea cups and the chicken being a little greasy or oily. With the tea, they probably ended up either getting it right after the sugar was put in and hadn't dissolved yet or the very last bit in the pitcher. It's not like every cup is going to be that way. And yea the chicken might have a little oil on it. It was just fried in oil.  No one ever eats fried chicken and sweet tea to be healthy. It's definitely not. But for every now and then, it's definitely fucking delicious."}
{"text":"Simply put, their food is not only dreadfully bland but is also made with lousy ingredients (preservatives), so it leaves a bad aftertaste and an allergic reaction."}
{"text":"There are chicken tenders , there are good chicken tenders, and there is raising canes. I honestly have not had better combination of chicken tenders and sauce ever.  The caniac is the combo to go with. 6 pieces of the holy grail, no friends but another piece of that epic toast please!! Get that large iced sweet tea or their awesome lemonade and do yourself a favor. Get extra sauce, a lot, and if you don't use it all ship it to me please."}
{"text":"The food is good.  I love the Cane's sauce.  But my last visit left me questioning whether or not I would ever go back.  While waiting for my order with my girlfriend and her mom, the manager/shift leader (Aurélie, I believe) who was working the window was making fun of my name, all this while I was sitting not more than 10 feet away. I found it to be rather distasteful.  Even the cashier who rang me up called her out on it but she continued.  The whole thing made it hard for me to enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great chicken fingers. Raising Cane's has delicious chicken fingers. Be sure and sign up for their rewards card."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Too bad there isn't one in California. And the guy who I believe is the manager is great and welcoming!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing my 400th Yelp review on Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers. Not only 400 reviews, but a 5-star one at that? Get outta here. Seriously though, I was sitting on 399 reviews for the longest time, thinking about what type of \"special\" restaurant I could review. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I'm just a simple dude who loves eating cheap, good food.  Listen, I love chicken. I can cook chicken a bazillion different healthy ways at home. But there's one thing I refuse to do at home, and that's deep frying. It's just too messy, too much of a hassle, and I can't stand looking at all that oil. But when I'm going out to eat, it's a completely different story. I search out for anything that's deep fried.  Thanks to Yelp, I had this place bookmarked for the longest time. On the next Vegas trip, we just had to check it out. The menu is pretty simple, as it all depends on how hungry you are for chicken strips. We opted for the \"Caniac\" combo, which comes with 6 chicken strips, fries, dipping sauce, cole slaw, toast, and drink for about $8. What a steal, and it was enough to feed for 2.  The chicken strips were of high quality, not greasy at all, not frozen, and not overly coated with all that breaded nonsense. When I took a bite, it was nothing but juicy, moist, and flavorful chicken. Dipped in their \"special\" sauce, it was even better. The sauce is a bit hard to describe, but there's definitely mayo, ketchup, and various spices like garlic, cayenne, and black pepper.   The crinkle fries were good, not soggy, crisp on the outside, which is all you can ask for. The surprise, for me, was how good the Texas toast and cole slaw were and how well they complimented the chicken fingers. The grilled toast with butter and garlic was tasty, and the cole slaw was cool and refreshing. I couldn't stop eating the stuff.  If I had things my way, I wished there was the option of more spice with everything. Maybe spicy chicken fingers, some hot sauce, or even a nice red squirt bottle of Siracha. For a fast food joint, I'd take these chicken fingers over something from Chick-Fil-A any day of the week. We seriously need one in SoCal. Now."}
{"text":"the best chicken finger place i ever went to. my homie told me i'm gonna love their secret sauce, and i DID. thanks to him i'm craving for it right now. the sizes of the chicken fingers are humongous. it's that sauce that will make you fall in love with it. you guys have to try out this place. i know i will when i come back in Vegas"}
{"text":"I love simple concepts like this. Limited menu items, which means you're getting consistent quality food at a fast pace. Great, filling chicken fingers and sides.  I will say that the pricing can get a bit confusing depending on what you want. In my case, it would have been cheaper to get MORE food with a combo meal, but opted out as I didn't want to waste food."}
{"text":"2weeks ago their Caniac without a drink was $7.89, but today they charged $9.03.. a 15% increase.. what a ripoff to us on a fixed income.. I wish ss would give us an increase like that... shame on u raising canes"}
{"text":"3 stars is for the service. Wednesday evening 11/02 at 544pm. I was the 12th car when I got in line. I got my food and excited at 627pm; 43 minutes in a drive-thru line! I understand they are still new and are probably much busier than expected, but 43 minutes is ridiculous! I went there 5 days ago at approx.the same time and was about the same place in line and waited 18 minutes. They need to figure something out."}
{"text":"I really like this place, mostly for the simple menu. They do chicken fingers and lemonade!  But, really, if you do just one thing, ya better be doing it well, and they do. The staff must like it, too, which explains why they are all so happy and were so eager to serve me...no long meetings and staying up late learning all the menu items!  Got the top item on the menu, which is my advice for going in virgin style and not knowing what's good, but then again, they only do chicken fingers! Mine disappeared before I knew it, and the traditional sauce had just the right spicy undertones with a smooth finish.  Drive thru looks like it runs pretty quickly, so now that I know what to order, chicken fingers and lemonade, I'll be driving thru when I'm in a hurry...nice job, dog!"}
{"text":"This is the best chicken for the price. Always clean. Staff is alway courteous. Drive through or walk in are both quick to get you your food."}
{"text":"Drive thru heaven!!! The drive thru is always a line even at night time beeeee-cause! It's the best chicken finger ever!! And the sauce is amazing! Did I mentioned fresh squeezed lemonade!? It's sooooo good!   Plenty of parking space so if you wanna eat in, don't chu worry, you won't be fighting anyone for a space."}
{"text":"We don't have a Raising Cane's in Hawaii, so when I came here, I had no expectations that I would be eating some ono fried chicken!!!  While I was driving to Trader Joe's in downtown Summerlin, I just so happen to pass a In-n-Out burger joint, so I told my pops that I wanted to stop by for a burger. When I actually got to that In-n-Out joint, I realized that the In-n-Out was a brand new restaurant, and that the restaurant had not opened yet (they were closed for a team meeting), as they were still putting the final touches to the restaurant.  From there, I noticed a Raising Cane's restaurant next door...........being that I'm from da 808, we don't have any Raising Cane's out here, so I figured we'd drop on in to see what they had to offer.  Upon walking into the joint, I was stund, as I realized this place was pretty popular..........I mean the joint was PACKED!!!!!  While waiting in line, I looked over the wall menu, and I guess Raising Cane's is similar like a Chick-Fil-A, as they only serve chicken here..........frrrrrried chicken that is! (Which is perfect for me!).  Although the line was long, the clerk was very efficient & moved the line quickly. Upon getting to the ordering counter, I ordered the following items -  1. The Sandwich Combo ($6.28) - which consisted of a 3 Chicken Fingers,  Cane's special sauce, Lettuce, Kaiser Roll, Crinkle Cut Fries, & a Drink from the open soda fountain.   2. The 3 Finger Combo ($6.47) - which consisted of 3 Chicken Fingers, Crinkle Fries, Cane's special sauce, Texas Toast, & a Drink from the open soda fountain.  What can I say about the grub?  You gotta new fan here from da 808! The fried chicken fingers was OUTSTANDING!!!  The chicken pieces were plump, juicy, crunchy, & did not taste oily at all! I really enjoyed how they did the chicken! To top it off, that Cane's special sauce was awesome too! Not sure what's in that special sauce, but if you told me it was crack, I'd probably believe you! Lol!  What an unexpected pleasant experience dining here! Should I ever visit the downtown Summerlin area again, I'll be sure to stop by Raising Cane's again!  To my friends from da 808, chance 'em gang! No can go wrong!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously my new addiction! Everyone is super friendly without totally overdoing it and making me feel uncomfortable, the food is reasonably priced and their secret sauce is to die for! I highly recommend this to anyone that's out with friends or just needs a bite to eat. There IS a drive thru! :))"}
{"text":"Tried Raising Cane's for the first time -- Amazing!!  I love that this place is ASU orientated. You have the Sun Devil Logos and vibe. The restaurant is clean and appealing.   I ordered the Box Combo: 4 Chicken Fingers, 1 coleslaw, 1  Texas Toast, Fries, and a drink. The food came out in less than a minute, which dazzled me.   I sat down and began my meal. First, the TOAST! My new favorite! The Texas toast was amazingly soft and incredibly tasty. The french fries were good, as well as the coleslaw. As for the chicken, it was juicy and tender.   Overall, the food and combination was GREAT. Will come back!!"}
{"text":"First time in a few days ago. Surprisingly at 200 pm the place was slammed full house hard to find a seat. Ordered a three piece tender meal with side waited about 6 minutes and they brought it out to me. The chicken was delicious unbelievably juicy and nice white chicken. The side was good and I had the sweet tea which was delicious as well. I'll be back. Great deal and value for the money."}
{"text":"The food is good and worth 4 stars. The Vegas Blvd facility honors the veteran with a 20% discount on 1 item not the whole order. 1"}
{"text":"In this lifetime there are certain places one should try and Raising Canes is included on that list. If you visit Las Vegas and don't stop here, you've missed out! Aside from the lemonade being fantastic, the Cane's sauce is by far the best condiment I've ever had in my life! I wish they bottled it up and let you buy it. Great food, basic and non-overwhelming menu makes Raising Canes a family favorite. All locations are consistent with each other, so don't worry you're missing out trying one over the other. One Love!"}
{"text":"Not the best when it comes to fast food but you get a lot of food for what you pay for. Stick with Chik-Fil-A for the better tasting chicken, though. I think I was jut happy to eat here because it felt like a breath of fresh air after the expensive dining options on the Strip."}
{"text":"Cleanliness: 3 Stars The front of the restaurant looks like the rest of it, everything was completely cluttered. For the volume this place and being a chain resturant the amount of people this place sees on any given morning I am disappointed by the food storage and prep areas..  Hospitality: 4 stars The staff was smiling and greeted me with a welcome. Friendly and repeating of my order with a smile.  Food: 5 Stars The portions are large and made fresh to order. All our meals were hot and came accurate.  Overall: This place is great for a \"quick\" meal and more affordable than a traditional sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing people and the managers are awesome. Been coming to this place for I believe 6 years when we moved to spring valley. We come here at least 6 times a month. Kind of upset with an issue that happened about week in half ago. Order my usually caniac for me and husband. Was missing a finger they were so small, fries were way too crispy our toast wasnt bbs and instead of sweet tea I somehow got coke. I never ever keep receipts they never mess up not in 6 years ive come here that's how awesome they really are. We go back and told because we didnt have receipt they couldn't do anything even though the girl recognized us from not even hour ago. They pretty much didnt believe us and I felt like I was a liar to them."}
{"text":"\"Welcome to Raising Canes where the chicken is kicking, the sauce is the boss, and the toast is the most!\"  Kicking chicken? CHECK. Bossy sauce? CHECK. Most out of the toast? CHECK.  There's really nothing bad to say about this place unless you're anti-fast food OR hate waiting in drive thru lanes.  I LOVE that there's one located on the southwest side. It's very convenient for me =)  I will continue to come back here time after time."}
{"text":"This is one of many food options at the Vegas outlet mall. The usual suspects were all present and I had never heard of this place before so we stopped in. I was hesitant at first because of the concept...just chicken strips..but boy was I pleasantly surprised!   First of all, the atmosphere was great! Lots of movie posters on the walls and plenty of pictures of Cane. The staff was lively and the place was packed for lunch. We ordered the standard offering of chicken strips, fries & Texas toast.   The strips were marinated and very tasty even without the sauce. It is the sauce that puts this place over the top. I will definitely try to make a return trip next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had my first experience with Raising Cane's today.  I got the Three Finger Meal and, for fast food, it was pretty good.  The breeding on the chicken was not overdone and, although not very seasoned, tasted pretty good.  They serve crinkle cut fries here, which I'm not usually a fan of but were actually decent.  The meal also came with Texas toast which basically was like a grilled half of a hot dog bun.  It was ok, if a bit of a gimmick.  The meal stood fine on its own without the extra carbs of the bread.  Lastly, the fresh squeezed lemonade was good.  Not overly sweet.    I guess the thing I liked best was the atmosphere.  The staff was friendly and the service was quick.  The location I ate at is pretty new so they may still be in the honeymoon stage, but I'd definitely return should I get a craving for chicken fingers again."}
{"text":"Just came from raising canes and we're pretty satisfied. Reality is chicken strips are chicken strips. I mean it doesn't send me over the moon or anything but it gets the job done! Wondering why I have four stars? Well for one their dipping sauce is CRAZY GOOD and so is their service!!! I went during lunch rush and it was super busy, did this slow things down? Nope! Got my food within less than five minutes and found a table pretty quickly despite the crowd. Now some other people weren't so lucky BUT their employees were nice enough to help them get a seat. I mean a worker stood there for 5+ mins holding a customers food till they got a seat! Not to mention they would also greet every single person who entered or left. Pretty good service for fast food I'd say!"}
{"text":"BEST FREAKIN CHICKEN FINGERS ANYWHERE!!! AND I DONT EVEN LIKE CHICKEN FINGERS!  The Texas Toast & Sweet Tea is a great pair. Chicken Fingers are Juicy as hell. Canes sauce is really great with the Chicken.  This is a must if you are in VEGAS. i dont think they have Raising Canes anywhere else.   I recommend the Caniac. Its worth the $8. Their food is still good as left overs.  I ordered the 3 pc once and i finished it and was craving more chicken the whole time!!"}
{"text":"I went to this canes after a long day, I had gotten a new card in the mail. Activated it and threw away the temp. I then proceeded to pay and it wouldn't work. I was frustrated and annoyed and the next window the manger had said don't worry about it we all go threw those problems. Here you go it's on me.  Amazing customer service very understandable and I had pulled in front and had time to get my card situated.  Very caring and loving. My favorite canes in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"First time customer! It was very good. Yes it's just chicken tenders but that dipping sauce was awesome. Location was clean, Food was fast amd a variety of choices for drinks. Came into town from San diego and just had to try it."}
{"text":"very good chicken for a fast food place. juicy meat in the chicken fingers and it tastes awesome dipped in the Cane's dipping sauce. I like that you get big pieces of actual chicken. I did not like the coleslaw, but I'm not a fan of coleslaw in general. the sweet tea is great - not TOO sweet like at most places. the worst thing about my meal was the fries. they serve the crinkly cut fries like you used to get with your cafeteria meal in elementary school. no flavor at all to the fries.   I'd definitely eat here again, but if given the choice between here and Chick-fil-a, I'd rather eat at Chick-fil-a because they use more flavor in the breading on their chicken and their waffle-cut fries are MUCH bettter than the fries here."}
{"text":"Awhile back I had a one of a kind canes experience. As a frequent visitor of many canes locations, I've often come across workers who seem to only worry about getting food out, whether the order is correct or not. Never having been to this particular store, I did not have high expectations for service, and am only drawn back to canes at all for the food. Luckily, I met the most fantastic employee who was more than helpful, extremely attentive, lively, and one of the best workers I've met in the food service industry. Be sure to look out for Nicole Benavente, she is the hero of this story. Despite the many unruly customers ahead of me, and a hectic atmosphere, I took notice of her kind and friendly attitude throughout the whole line. After servicing many crazy customers, I kept expecting her to be burnt out and just shuffle me through as many employees would, but she remained energetic and made me happy to be there. Normally I prefer to tell managers directly about their employee's great service, but I feel this young lady deserves a public post about how incredible she was. If you see this, thank you, Nicole, you're a great kid and I hope you get more of the recognition you deserve."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand what the hype is over this place.  The food is alright, there's nothing special about it. It was pretty bland to me as well.  Came here with my parents for dinner and as soon as we all took a bite, we looked at one another and said \"Chick-Fil-A is better.\"   Staff is nice and service is fairly quick. We sat down and probably waited 10mins until our food arrived and the place was completely packed."}
{"text":"They don't advertise it, but they also have a honey mustard sauce if you don't like the regular sauce.  Just ask for it.  It's good :)"}
{"text":"Raising Cane's is a must try as well as a must EAT on every visit to Las Vegas. Here's the reason's why:   +Fresh and delicious food +Texas Toast +Tasty Fries +Friendly staff & service +Wife LOVES the sweet iced tea +Will allow you to substitute the coleslaw for a Texas Toast free  This location is not too far from the Orleans Hotel & Casino as well as the In-N-Out Burger on Dean Martin Drive. Basically the same layout as most Cane's stores. The parking lot is great with ample parking."}
{"text":"First time trying Raising Cane's. I looked it up on Yelp and saw all the positive reviews, so it was on my list when visiting Las Vegas.   First of all, this was by far the best chicken fingers/strips that I have ever tasted.  I had the 3 Finger Meal and it was VERY delicious. It tastes more like fried chicken and that's awesome. One of the best items that comes with the meal is the Texas toast. I loved the buttery flavor and how soft it was. The crust side has sesame seeds. The fries are also great as well, not oily.   The staff is very friendly. It got busy at this location, as the line went out the door at several occasions. Inside was crowded with customers enjoying their food. The restaurant is clean. I could see a worker on several occasions wiping the tables. The worker even wiped down the seats! Something quite rare to see in these days. So yes, very clean.   I thought the prices for the combo meals were affordable.   In summary, this is a great place that specializes only in chicken fingers. Food is affordable, abundant and delicious. Will definitely return here and be on my list of places to frequent."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Great food, very, very good sweet tea. Food is always hot and tender. The waiting time is very short, and I like it when they bring food to your table."}
{"text":"The best fried chicken I have ever ate!!! Everything about Raising Canes is amazing. My friends and I would eat this everyday during EDC music festival. I'm huge on sauces, and boy does their sauce sauce not disappoint! I believe it was canes sauce? It was an orange color. The chicken tenders were nice and crispy. I savored each bite! A shame there isn't any on the East Coast. The sweet tea was the best sweet tea I've ever had and I live in Atlanta."}
{"text":"Man do I love this food chain. No matter what you order from the menu, it's good and filling. I just discovered this company last year so, I visit it at least once every other month Or when outer townies come to visit.   Mr. JP   p.s.  If your at this location between 1030 am - 3 O'clock and you order in.... When they ask for your name... Reply : TIANA..."}
{"text":"This is my chicken finger fix!!! Kid's meal for $3.99 and life is good. The staff is always super fun. Sometimes they sing to you.. The staff at this location has offered me a rap on what to order, they make my day:]   I don't get chicken fingers anywhere else because I know I will be disappointed. Here, they are so simple and that's what makes them so good. Juicy, tender, & flaky breading. Pair this with their magical sauce... Yeah, you'll be back.   I think I am the only person to visit Cane's to not have their sweet tea or Texas toast.. Perhaps sometime in the near future.."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love canes the food is delicious. Its mainly the customer service, I ordered the box combo with an extra toast aside instead of coleslaw and i also ordered the sandwich combo with canes sauce and toast aside. While ordering the girl is taking our order through the drive thru and while my bf is telling her the order you can hear male voice yelling on the background at the same time as the girl is taking our order. She repeats what we wanted, everything seemed to be ok, that guy on background did bother me because my bf had to repeat himself. I was already iffy once I heard the guy, anyways we go to the first window to pay and the girl at the window also repeats the order and I tell my boyfriend she didn't mention the toast or canes sauce on my order. So he tells her and she says that will be 1$ extra, she already had run my card too! So there goes another transaction. And I'm thinking fine, I'll get my toast and sauce.. ok.. we get home to find no toast for me, just one sauce and my bf did get his extra toast. I'm pretty upset, I didn't check the food at that moment because we let them know at the window and it was paid for already, I trusted them. My sandwich combo also always has canes sauce on the buns, well guess what. It didn't have any at all! The chicken fingers seemed to be dry due to that. For future reference the workers should pay more attention to what people are ordering."}
{"text":"Why did the chicken cross the road?  To have a family reunion at Raising Cane's!  ...I have a weird sense of humor.  I apologize.  I've been wanting to try Raising Cane's for a while after hearing the teenie bopper at work rave about it on and on.  After losing $15 in Bingo, we decided to swing by to soothe our aching hearts and rumbly tummies.    When we first walked in, the place was desolate with the exception of a few tables.  After we sat down and were waiting for our food, the place got busy.  There were four combinations to choose from and a kid's meal as your options.  I chose The Finger Combo since I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw.  I got three chicken strips, crinkle french fries, and Texas toast with my meal.  The chicken was pretty good!  Great flavor, I like the breading, but they were a bit small.  They give you Cane's sauce for dipping them in which tastes mainly of mayonnaise, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce.  NBD, why is everyone freaking out over the sauce?  It tastes kind of like Thousand Island dressing.  I was later told by my brother that I should have asked for gravy.  Mmm, gravy.  Anywho, the fries were okay and the bite of coleslaw I yoinked tasted decent as well.  I'm loving that Texas toast too!  Don't park east of the restaurant because this place gets crazy busy and the drive-thru line could block you in.  All in all, it was decent eats.  But $6 for three tiny chicken tenders?  Come on!    \"I want to be strapped to a table, while a family of chickens argues over who gets to eat my legs.\""}
{"text":"Does it get any better than this? Only chicken fingers, crinkle fries, cole slaw, Texas toast, dipping sauce and beverages adorn the menu. It's like the soup nazi does chicken...except it's the best damned chicken you've ever had and the customer service is more than delightful. I'm a fried chicken. NUT and this place not only slays, but it serves the best fresh hand battered and fried chicken I've had in a commercial kitchen. Period. My waistline don't lie, y'all. You can TASTE that it's not frozen. And the sauce is seriously killer. I don't put ketchup on fries and hardly use condiments at all and I can drink this sauce like it's V8. Get your chicken-lovin' buns to Cane's...the menu is simple and so is the experience; simply amazing."}
{"text":"I love raising canes but this particular location is going downhill they have way to many young people working here.They are messing up people food alot mangers need to get the staff together seriously."}
{"text":"Seems a litle overpriced for chicken, fresh or not.  I think if you skip the value meals and just get singles pieces of chicken, it may be a little more worth it.  This place doesn't hold a candle to Buffalo Wild Wings.  BW3's has more sauces, more selection and better prices.  I'd say hang on to your $$ and go get a snickers bar."}
{"text":"One of the best Fast food Chicken places! You can never go wrong with their chicken fingers, fries and coleslaw with texas toast.  Do not forget to order one extra of their special sauce. That is what makes this chicken even better! They are breaded lightly and never too much. Crispy but not too much. Just perfect! Dunk your fries in the sauce its better than ketchup and I love ketchup.  The sweet tea is awesome! Perfect match with your meal! Yum!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give them a 0. But today is the last day I will go this location and maybe Canes in general the manager that was duty early in the afternoon was real rude. I don't want to get into all the details. But thank you Canes because you showed that you don't care about customer service.."}
{"text":"After a day of travel and tiling the hallway, Dad was hungry and wanted something filling. Cane's answered that call.   Cane's fried chicken is awesomely delicious. The menu is very simple, you have you choice of 3 - 6 chicken strips, with fries, bread, maybe coleslaw. And lets not forget there dipping sauce.  So dad got the 6 piece, i got the 3. I'm not a huge fan of the dipping sauce, but Dad ate it like it was going out of style. I'm not really sure how to compare it. Its a little sweet, little spicy, not quite bbq sauce. It looks like white gravy, but so did not taste like it. Maybe thats why I had a distaste for it.  The chicken and fries themselves were delicious. The bread was on point, but my meal was a little large. Next time i might just get the kids meal. Dad ate his whole meal, but then again, he was waiting on me to land before he ate."}
{"text":"Weird things happen to me when I visit Vegas.  That night at Imperial Palace and the aftermath is something I can't comment about, but if questioned by the police I will plead the fifth.  For some unknown reason, I ended up here. The traffic on the 15 was frightful and I took a side street and instantly became hungry. Go figure.  The long race from LA to Vegas left me famished and comida was needed.  This concept of a small amount of menu items dominated by chicken was experienced by this Yelper many moons ago in Tallahassee during my days as a student at The Florida State University.  Guthrie's was the name I believe.    Pun intended:  I didn't experience a religious revival of my soul after eating here.    The 3 finger combo (pic included) should be appropriately changed to the middle finger combo.  3 chicken fingers, fries, buttered toast (more butter is needed), and a 22 ounce soft drink for $7.    The chicken was nothing to write home about.  The word Ore-Ida crossed my mind when devouring the fries.     I can write more about my meal here, but why take up more of Yelp's space..........."}
{"text":"I love this chicken! It's so good, and the sauce is awesome too. I have never had a bad experience or had bad food here. Love it."}
{"text":"Ate here twice on vacation and had great experience. Staff is friendly, efficient and takes pride in their work that is seen in everything they do.  From cleaning tables, to cooking food, greeting and serving customers. The chicken was obvious quality, white meat chicken breast in fingers.  It was moist and not heavily breaded. Really wish they had one in Oregon"}
{"text":"Oh Cane's....I am in love with you!   I ate here for the first time only a few short months ago and I can't believe I never discovered this place sooner. Every time I come in (which lets face it, it's at least once a week) the staff is always friendly and the service is quick.  For $6 I can get 4 hot, perfectly seasoned chicken fingers, a whole lotta crinkle fries, the most amazing, buttery Texas toast I've ever ate and to top it all off... I get this blissful little cup of Cane's sauce, which is to die for. Really, $6? Best value for the quality of \"fast food\" you get...I can't even get out of McDonald's that cheap.  Hold up....let me circle back for just a moment. Did I tell you home much I love the Cane's sauce? I dip EVERYTHING in it (including my fingers!). You only get one with your meal but I am willing to sacrific my coleslaw side for them to throw in an extra one for me. Plus if you need more, they're like 19 cents. Big whoop.   This place is what dreams are made of ;) Swoon!"}
{"text":"A 3 piece chicken finger sandwich, fries, and a medium drink for $6 is an amazing deal. Cane's sauce is amazing but they don't put enough on the sandwiches so be prepared to pay an extra I think .29 cents for a cup of it."}
{"text":"Chicken tenders are a weakness for me. If I don't know what to order, I always revert back to tenders. We had raising canes probably 3 times on our trip out here and each time was consistently fresh. It's all they make so they better make it right, right? Texas toast is awesome too. Wish they had one in colorado!"}
{"text":"I love love love anything fried and Raising Cane's chicken is fantastic.  They fried the chicken right as you order it; so it's fresh, crispy, and very flavorful.  I was in Vegas for the weekend and I had this place 3 times, it's so addicting.  Can't wait til they come out to LA!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken fingers at Raising Canes! You can always expect a hot meal, quick service and friendly staff! I would like to commend Brandon at the drive thru window 12/04/14 for his excellent service! It's amazing how far a little kindness can go!"}
{"text":"Traditionally I don't eat fried Chicken but I was involved in a charity walk for the Crohn's Colitis Foundation of America (@ccfa) and food was donated by one of our local Raising Cane's.  Not only was it fantastic to me, everyone at the event felt the same!  The lemonade is wonderful and the chicken is NOT greasy unlike other chicken restaurants.   Raising Cane's is a great community minded restaurant with the best fast food fried chicken I have tasted. My husband loves it and now requests it for meals after our charity walk! Well done!"}
{"text":"Second to only Zaxbys !  But since there is no Zaxbys on the westcoast... They carry the crown for chicken finger spots. The service is better than there franchises in the south."}
{"text":"I just went here the other day and it wasn't as clean as it used to be. There was food on the table and the cashier didn't wash her hands before handling food utensils/plates and touched the interior of my container. The food can never be bad because well...it's canes chicken. This place is much more convenient than the other locations so that's a big plus. The rating is solely based on the food and location. While the chicken may taste amazing, it's the sauce that keeps people coming back."}
{"text":"First off, I love the ambiance. I love that they incorporated a lot of southern interior design from their walls to their floors.   If you are new, I suggest you get \"The Box Combo.\" It includes all their goodies: 4 Chicken Fingers, a side of fries, coleslaw, their infamous Cane's sauce (which I think tastes like Thousand Islands with some seasoning), Texas Toast, and a drink of your choice.  Also, if you've got a big appetite, I suggest you get \"The Caniac Combo.\" It is exactly what it sounds: 6 Chicken Fingers, extra fries, coleslaw, 2 Cane's sauce, Texas Toast, and a large drink! They also have a kid's meal.    Service are super friendly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The chicken is the best part of the meal with the sauce. The fries are really starchy and not what I was expecting. They had great customer service, I was given the wrong order at the drive thru and I told them and they gave me a whole new meal and let me keep the other one. I will go back just for the chicken."}
{"text":"Crispy chicken nuggets -- delicious! So - so fries. Their signature sauce leaves something to be desired but that's just my opinion. Kid at the drive thru was a bit off, though... I paid, waited for my food, received my food, then he asked me if I'd already paid. Haha, just a little chuckle to give me a lasting impression."}
{"text":"Not something I eat a lot but enjoy it whenever I do go. One of my pet peeves is places that serve cold fries or stuff that's been sitting for awhile. Never happens here always fresh and reasonably priced. Seems to be real white meat chicken and not the processed stuff. The sauce is for sure awesome! I add honey mustard dipping as well for a small charge. Only thing I don't like is the ice that they use. Sounds weird but it's the real tiny bits of ice. Good spot for a quick lunch at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"They have the best food. So good I go comatose.. That sauce is amazing! haha.. Another good thing is they have quick service usually. Always greeting with a smile."}
{"text":"I love everything on their menu. Bring it on! I went to this location pretty much everyday on my trip to Vegas. I recently found out that they are in Chicago area as well. Can't be more excited!"}
{"text":"Not what I expected, for some reason I thought the chicken strips would be more crunchy and flavorful, maybe I have been eating way to many Blue Ribbon strips. At first, they didn't seem anything special, but I quickly became addicted to them. I ended eating 9 strips in one sitting, probably the most chicken strips I've ever ate in a single meal, that says a lot. lol"}
{"text":"So unhappy right now that Utah does not have Raising Canes. The food is good here.  It's the perfect semi cheat meal. They're deep fried so fat and calorie content are high, but if you can convince yourself otherwise.  They are chicken breast which is very high in protein, then that makes it ok. I guess? Just pass on the fries.  Wait.... The fries are good too! Just eat here. Worry about burning the calories later."}
{"text":"Yes Yes...it's true, not much more I can add or say that my fellow Yelpers have not already covered. Cane's rocks me like a hurricane!  I usually get the Caniac combo: 6 Chicken Fingers  Extra Fries  Coleslaw  2 Cane's Sauce  Texas Toast  Large Drink   I say go big or go home!  It's been awhile...but I can still remember just the way you taste..."}
{"text":"Everything is great about this place. I always get The Caniac ($8.79) and share with my husband. It comes with 6 chicken fingers, fries, and coleslaw. Their sauce is bomb too. The Texas toast ever fails. My favorite thing from here is the sweet tea. It's not sugar water like other places. It's the perfect combination of tea and sugar. Every time my husband and I come to vegas, Raising Cane's is always our first and last stop."}
{"text":"My sister & her family live in Minnesota & they rave about Raising Cane's so I was excited to see we have a Cane's in Phoenix. However, I thought the chicken strips were just good, not great. The coleslaw was inedible and the fries were pretty mushy. I'd rather go to Popeye's or KFC."}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers ever! I heard a lot about this place from  the south and it definitely lived up to the hype.   Chicken fingers are just perfect Special sauce is on point  Texas toast was a nice addition  The fires aren't really that good and unnecessary in my opinion.   If you ever see one of these anywhere, pull over and try it!"}
{"text":"Serving a burger with no lettuce is sloppy work. You represent a chain. Quality is expected. I have my receipt. Being busy is not a reason to slack off."}
{"text":"Zoey and Tyrus are AWESOME!! Before our crew even entered the restaurant, the dynamics duo of Zoey and Tyrus caught my eye. Their respective, positive attitudes set the tone to such a wonderful evening. And a big shout out to Anthony Navarro for being just as awesome! This was my very first time dining at this restaurant and I must say, the food was delicious but the staff was amazing. Zoey and Tyrus have an amazing future with big goals and dreams and I pray that their dreams come true in the grandest way. Stay blessed you guys and keep being the bar that others need to raise their level to!!!"}
{"text":"Raising Canes is on point.  The Texas toast is cooked to the Chicken Fingers are always cooked to order and piping hot and goes well with the delicious dipping sauce. The coleslaw is a throwback from when you wouldn't think about eating anything\"green\" but is just what complete the meal. Chow!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken tenders I've ever had.  Their sauce is amazing too.  The sauce is also good with their Texas toast and french fries.  Even if you see a long line at this place, it won't take more than 10 min.  They are extremely quick their.  Their food is always hot and my order has always been correct."}
{"text":"So I live in LA, and there are no Raising Cane's chicken in California.  I used to live in Denver, CO and frequented the Raising Cane's in Fort Collins.  I already wrote a review for that one, so here's the link to that review:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/raising-canes-chicken-fingers-fort-collins#hrid:1ns4kDv57mzgVrBFXMM02Q  UPDATE -I DID drive the 3 (actually 4 to be more accurate) hours to Vegas to get Raising Cane's chicken!  Although it was 6 hours this time (damn Friday traffic *shakes fist*) ......and I'm also dating a guy in the area, so now I have 2 reasons to come to Vegas.  :)   In fact, I'm eating my 3 strip combo box right now....I didn't need to buy the extra Cane sauce, but I'd rather be over prepared.  I would have eaten Canes yesterday when I got here to Vegas, but I found a Chic Fil A in Upland on my way out of CA, and because those are scarce in LA as well, I ate lunch there.  I know, I know.....how could I, right?  Truth is......I think I enjoy both chicken places equally.  It's the motivation of \"the trip\" to a rare eatery that arouses me.  Chic Fil A with their tasty chicken, waffle fries, side salad and lemonade, and Raising Cane's with their tasty chicken, crinkle cut fries, garlic texas toast and sweet tea.  They're sort of like brothers.  Anyway, go put some Cane's in your belly.  ASAP"}
{"text":"I gobbled up their fries, Texas toast, and chicken tenders in about 30 seconds flat. Absolutely amazing"}
{"text":"Busy for dinner! Cars were wrapped all around the building and almost all tables inside were occupied. I was surprised to see how fast they move because we didn't have to wait very long. It is one of the best fast food chains so I can see why. They also have great combos!"}
{"text":"Got sick for eating the chicken even my cousin we both spent all day in bathroom dieing"}
{"text":"You don't expect too much when it comes to fast food but this place blew expectations out of the water. Customer service was amazing and the food was great! It also didn't break our budget to eat here which was much appreciated."}
{"text":"Fast service. Ambience just like any other typical fast food franchise. Chicken is good. Texas Toast and the Cane's sauce keeps them in the competition."}
{"text":"Before writing this I fully admit I love Popeye's Chicken (spicy) and if Church's Chicken has it on their menu they are my 2nd favorite fast food spicy chicken joint. I was convinced to give this place a try and was sorely disappointed in fact both of us were.   First on the positive side the chicken fingers were nice and juicy all white meat chicken. The order taker was helpful in explaining the menu and options but that is were I have to start on the negatives.  No spicy chicken option. They give you a pack of hot sauce but its just a regular vinegar based sauce not my favorite and not particular spicy.   Their signature sauce is OK but nothing special. In this humble Yelpers opinion it tastes like they mixed a few condiments together. Not bad but nothing special enough to build a franchise around.   Its not a bad franchise but if you are craving spicy or even flavorful chicken you have better options available less than 2 miles away in either direction"}
{"text":"some of the best chicken fingers you will find is here, there crinkle cut fries are a step ahead of the traiditional fries you see everywhere, and what sets all the chicken and the fries flavor off is there cane sauce, ( cost extra ) but well worth it. the chicken is very moist and flavorful and comes with delicious Texas toast. so good, worth the trip everytime!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Cane's here on Flamingo and once again it's ok but nothing to write home about. Check out what I think:  Sweet tea is great!  French fries are crinkle cut and nothing exciting  Chicken Strips....: Eh... they are ok. Personally I hoped for more taste and flavor. Personally the strips are not that exciting  Texas toast: It's toast that is the size of Texas... need I say more?   I go only because it is close to school and personally I am tired of everything they have on campus."}
{"text":"I am so impressed with Cane's and Laz for taking care of me and my complaints. I can say I have no complaints now and am proud to call my self a CANIAC, I will continue to come only here, and bring my friends and family only here for our fried chicken fix. Fries are crispy and fresh, Texas toast amazing, slaw perfect mix, and the chicken, it's just the best!"}
{"text":"I thought about doing some pros vs cons on this one, but I could not find too many cons. They are nice and accommodating, They bring you the food quick and politely. The place was very clean and they did a great job managing the crowd."}
{"text":"a few months ago my son and I ate at the casa grande location and we both got very sick. hadn't had anything to eat prior to going to here. called the mgr. chris and told him, I even wrote to corporate and have not yet heard a thing back from them. wasent even offered my money back, just told me hope you get well. I hope this does not happen to anyone else."}
{"text":"Chicken was hot and fresh. The special sauce compliments the chicken. The service was fast"}
{"text":"I really wish they had one of these in the OC/LA area. But I guess that would be bad because I would eat here everyday, if that were the case.  I always make it a point to stop here on the way in to Las Vegas and on the way out. I love everything about this place, from the sweet tea to the amazing dipping sauce!  The food is always fresh and comes out piping hot! The prices are great and the 6 piece combo is definitely enough to split between two people (but add an extra thing of Texas Toast because it is just that amazing).    You will not regret eating at this place."}
{"text":"Chicken fingers?   More like chicken nuggets.  For the nearly 7 dollars I spent I was expecting much more.  Pretty weak."}
{"text":"I tried Raising Canes about 2 weeks ago and have gone back 4 more times so far. This restuarant is only a mile from my new house that I purchased 11/04.  I've had the strips alone and the strip sandwich. The cane sauce is great on the sandwich but when I eat the strips by themselves I prefer the honey mustard. Where the hell is the ranch and bleu cheese?  The chicken is fresh and the batter is light which I prefer.    My only knock on this place is a small one. It has to do with the way they take my order. Lets say I order a three chicken finger sandwich. The conversation will go like this - (EVERY TIME)  Hi can I get  a chicken sandwich with Cane sauce please?  Sure - What kind of drink would you like with that?  Huh? Who said drink? Just a sandwich with cane sauce please.  Oh OK im sorry, Sandwich Combo with no drink please pull around.  At Window - That will be $ X (about three dollars more than I have in my hand)  What? I thought the sandwich was $4.32  Sandwich? You wanted fries and toast too.  No I didnt, I hate french fries and I dont even eat toast in the morning with my eggs.  Oh Im sorry, I must have misunderstood.  Other than this, which I have gone through every time - even the one time I went to the location on the other side of town - I have to say the service is pretty good. The people are friendly and the place looks clean. I know that this high pressure approach is the result of stupid managers pushing sodas and 'combos' to people who dont want them and not due to the ineptitude of their employees."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken fingers EVER. I wish San Diego had this place instead of wings n things. I was craving chicken late at night when we were visiting family in Vegas. Canes was open til 11pm so we zipped on over. The chicken fingers are soo juice y and full of meat and not breading like some chicken fingers. They are also no greasy. I love love love the dipping sauce and the fries you get with the combo. I m not so into the toast you get with your meal so i gave it to my bf :)"}
{"text":"This location is finally open and I can try their food!!! everything was pretty good for the most part. You can't really mess up chicken fingers or fancy them up. The chicken was crispy and tender and so were their fries. The chicken meals come with a garlic butter toast which was good but seemed a bit out of place ad everytime I took a bite of the toast I wanted spaghetti. The service was great, everyone there seems happy and energetic, probably because it's their first day open. It's a fast food joint but the workers came around and provided service like offering to take our trash and giving us refills. overall it's a pretty good spot if you're in the mood for good quality chicken fingers."}
{"text":"One of the only fast food places I will ever visit. The service and food are really good for such a simple menu. It's really just chicken fingers, French fries, Texas toast and Cole slaw.   I recommend joining the Caniac club which is free to join, just ask for a card, register your email and you will get a free box combo as well as emails for promotions. Today for Mother's day,  it was buy 1 get 1 box combos and they usually do the same for Father's day."}
{"text":"Great chicken strips. Hot, cooked to perfection, plump and juicy!  I never get the fries or toast or anything, but the chicken is fab!"}
{"text":"I really wish their chicken wasn't so bland!  Also, they're so SLOW!  Don't bother with the drive thru if you're in a hurry, it ain't happening.  Sometimes and I stress sometimes, it's easier to park and go inside."}
{"text":"I know this is a fast food restaurant.... but I LOVE Cane's! Great food!   Although I never finish it all, I always order The Box, so that I can have a taste of all the good food- it comes with chicken fingers, yummy dipping sauce, fries, toast, coleslaw, and drink! I appreciate the fresh brewed iced tea!"}
{"text":"Start your review...food to be mediocre. I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted freshly cooked chicken and fries. The staff did not cut any corners even though it was close to closing time.  The girl who took my order was very friendly, however after she took my order she close the window and stated something at which time several other staff members came to the window to stare at me. I don't know if it was because I was in an unmarked security patrol car or it was because I was in uniform but I was a little uneasy about that. Once I receive my food I felt I needed to double check it to make sure nothing had been done intentionally to my food. Nothing had been done and the food was awesome but the demeanor of the staff detracted from my experience at this specific location.  I would suggest this place only for persons not in uniform or working as many times we are targets of misplaced aggression of cooks and other personnel. That being said if I was not in uniform or driving a patrol car I would definitely return to this location. The food was awesome and on its own warrants my return."}
{"text":"This place just isn't as amazing as it used to be. I used to be obsessed with Raising Cane's and their sauce and texas toast, however things change. I went thru the drive-thru hoping to get a delicious meal before studying. The service was pretty good, the people were smiley and friendly, but the food, BLEHG. I've never experienced such un-fresh food from what is supposed to be a really good fast food place. The fries were cold and soggy, the toast was mushy (which has made me awfully upset because that's the best part), and the chicken was not hot. They say it's \"fresh\" but my whole box just felt old and like it's been sitting back there for hours. Needless to say, I was disappointed and most likely will never return unless someone else wants to go there."}
{"text":"Love love love Canes! The food is cooked to order so everything is super fresh! Usually a long line every time I go. But worth it. The fresh lemonade is good. Military discount offered."}
{"text":"I don't review many fast food restaurants but Raising Cane's is always a pleasantly consistent experience. Don't look for health food here, just perfectly cooked and delicious chicken fingers. The crinkle cut fries are crispy and the cole slaw always fresh. I usually sub an extra canes sauce instead of the bread. The sauce is a perfect match with the chicken.   The employees here have always been friendly and the service fast. Even when the drive thru line is long they get you in and out quickly.  I don't eat here too often but when I get the craving it's hard to resist!"}
{"text":"Cane's is the epitome of chicken fingers and honestly fast food in general.   The food you get here is always top notch in flavor and quality. This is not your usual rubbery, reject chicken that has been fried and comes out coated in grease. I don't know how they do it, but Cane's uses the juiciest, most flavorful chicken that I have ever gotten from a fast food place. Their fries are always crisped to perfection and don't suffer from being mushy or under cooked. Don't even get me started on the Cane's sauce, it is like mouth magic. The texas toast brings any meal together with its toasted exterior and fluffy texture.   Service is always fast and friendly and if there is ever an issue (which there rarely is) you can trust the staff will help you. Out of all the times I have come here, I have only received one \"bad\" chicken tender. It was really small and was made of mostly breading which is not normal at all. I brought it to the attention of the staff and they promptly replaced it and even offered me an extra tender!   This is my go to fast food!"}
{"text":"Canes is the last bastion of the long lost concept of \"customer service\" in a world of unreliable, apathetic  and pathetic experiences i pay to have. Canes cares about each customers experience and produces consistently amazing freshly made food."}
{"text":"Chicken portion was small, menu pictures look much bigger. Chicken seemed to have been sitting in fryer too long. $20 for 3 combo meals not bad. Oh yeah... get some barbecue sauce."}
{"text":"the chicken is always kicken!!!!!!!!! I LOVE THE TEXAS TOAST AND CANES SAUCE IS THE BOSS!. juicy crispy always fresh  minimal menu simple but  kick ass food!!"}
{"text":"Don't come here after 10:30pm , service is poor, food takes to long, the cashiers could not get the right order rung, could not find our anniversary gift, we ask for  Lemonade no ice, he give us ice cups , he got to charge us, second charge for .65, had to pay again, tried to talk to the fry cook cashier manager, she was to busy locking door and playing to hear my concerns. Very loud,lobby  drive thur very long line. Order was wrong we left with what we got and glad to get out.  Yelp says they close at midnight, they close lobby at 11p.  We wish we had gone else where. Not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"Granted the food is okay - nothing to write home about but I did give them four stars for tonights (4/13/15) drive-thru employee who was kind, upbeat and quick.  I spilled my drink on my passenger seat and before I turned back for my change he had a few sheets of paper towels ready.  In this age of customer service these little things do make me come back!"}
{"text":"My son hipped me to this place when I went to visit him in Vegas.  I thought it was really good not to mention a great idea.  We were all really happy when we learned that Cane's Plaza and restaurant was opening.   The selection is limited but the chicken strips are tasty.  The boxes come with cole slaw (or not - depending on the size) and fries.  The toast is awesome and so is the seweet tea."}
{"text":"O EMM GEEE..... I am so in love with Raising Cane's!!   When I lived in California, my favorite chicken place was Chick-fil-A. I was sad to learn that they did not have any locations here in Vegas. So I have been living here for about 10 months now and only discovered Raising Cane's maybe about a month ago. Can you believe that? Where have I been?!?! The first time we ate here, my husband and I liked it so much, that we came back for a second visit in the same week! Or was it 3? :P  This place kind of reminds me of In-N-Out. Simple menu - you pick either chicken fingers or a sandwich. All of their combos come with fries, some of them also include Texas Toast and Coleslaw. I usually order the Box Combo: - 4 chicken fingers: crispy on the outside, hot and juicy on the inside! - Cane's sauce: I have no idea what it is made out of, but a very good dipping sauce. - Fries: crinkle cut style. I like how they don't make my fingers too greasy!  - Texas Toast: Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Buttery goodness! I didn't know about this until my third visit, but you can ask them to \"BBS\" your toast, which means butter both sides.  - Cole Slaw: I was never a fan of coleslaw, so I usually substitute with more fries or another piece of toast. - Sweet tea: great tasting and very addicting! Not too sweet like the one at McDonald's or Chick-fil-A, but not bland, which makes it perfect! I also like the crushed ice!  The employees are very welcoming and friendly. If you dine in, they will bring your food out to you if it's not too busy. The manager will also walk around and stop by your table to ask how the food is tasting.   Also, if you come here often like I do, you might want to join the Caniac Club. You get a Caniac Club Card that will be swiped with every purchase. It's free to join and you earn points for every visit toward free food. I got a free Box Combo for signing up! Awesome! Be sure to ask about it, because they don't really promote the Caniac Club, other than the small print out on the bottom of your receipt.   I am so happy that I found my new home for chicken! I'll be back again very soon. I just wish that there was a location closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Been a fan of Raising Cane's since moving to Las Vegas. The menu is simple - you either pick chicken fingers or the chicken sandwich (or both). I usually get the box combo, which comes with 4 chicken fingers. Sometimes I'll get the caniac combo (6 chicken fingers) and share the extra chicken with my 3 dogs! They love it. I always skip the cole slaw and ask for more fries. The chicken is always great - crispy on the outside and hot and tender on the inside. The crinkle-cut fries are usually pretty good, although once in a while they don't cook them long enough and are too soggy. The sauce is tasty and I usually am too full to even take a bite out of the Texas Toast. For those of you who don't know, you can ask to have the toast \"BBS\" (butter both sides, it may taste better that way).  I have never ate inside the restaurant at this location, but I go to the drive-thru. It's always so crowded. Also dislike how this location is on Rainbow Blvd, where the traffic is really bad. The employees are friendly and repeat your order back to you twice, once after you order and again right before you pay just to make sure they got things right. That's great customer service for a fast food place!   Every year during the holidays, they sell a plush puppy to support local pet organizations. This year its a white elephant puppy, I just bought one today. Still hoping that Chick-fil-A will eventually open a location on the Westside, but until then I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love Cane's!!  Love the chicken, the bread, and the Cane's sauce!  Service is always good, even in the drive-thru!"}
{"text":"Juicy Tender Fried chicken strips! This place is amazing! I don't think I've ever been here and didn't like the chicken... It is always juicy and full of flavor and the fries that it comes with is always Fresh, crispy and goes great with my fried chicken, secret sauce, Texas toast and drink!  If you're in Vegas you gotta try this place, plus it saves you sooo much money not going to a Buffet. Cheap prices, restaurant is always clean, Great/polite services and amazing food!"}
{"text":"One of the best chicken places around..... Staff is pretty friendly and they get your order right! The chicken always comes out piping Hot and juicy -- I've never had a piece of dry chicken at Raising Canes, I really wish we had one in LA, you know how much business they would have here?! Raising Cane's chicken is deliciously seasoned, their fries are great and the Texas Toast is amazing, it seems like they are always busy so the food is always made fresh. Oh don't forget their dipping sauce, to me it tastes like a smokey Chipotle sauce with Ranch? Very delicious! Very Clean restaurant and cool photos/decor."}
{"text":"Wom-wom-wooom!!!  I luv me sum good chicken & these chicken fingers were on point!  They were breaded so rite & real real tender...No lie...U can order them in 3 strips or 4 strips or 6 strips...It comes wit fries (crinkle cut), sum toast, & sum coleslaw...I don't do coleslaw, so I got an xtra toast...Can I jus say the toast is delish?  MAN!!!  My boy MG hooked me 2 this spot(note hooked, not hip...cuz this joint was BOMB)...Definite repeat spot, 4 real..."}
{"text":"What could a name like Raising Cane's possibly be? Well, it proved to be genius when the owner decided to use his dog's name to sell hot, fresh chicken fingers! Its all I think about now.    Having only consumed twice, I can happily say, I am addicted!  The only places I can remotely compare them to here locally are Popeye's, Church's, and KFC.  But honestly, I feel like they are in a separate league.  What they offer is uber simple, yet crazy addicting.  Chicken Fingers + Crinkle Fries + Coleslaw + Buttery Toast, wait a second? Buttery Toast? That's right.  And then they pack their \"secret\" sauce that you must dip into! Its the chicken finger's sidekick!  I mean, can Batman really save Gotham without Robin? Come'on! ;-p  The beauty of their chicken fingers is how the batter is light and thin, yet full of flavor!  I could barely detect any kind of grease!  The chicken meat is perfectly tender! And their \"secret\" sauce is like a peppery thousand island with other unknown variables!  I personally come for the sauce!  Their crinkle fries are some of the best I've ever had, crispy and simply delicious! The coleslaw is average at best but I like how the cabbage is diced into perfect little squares! The sesame toast is lightly buttered and can be enjoyed by itself! Who doesn't like that?!  The two times I have dropped by, I always got the Combo Box Meal.  Comes with 4 pieces of chicken, fries, coleslaw, toast, and a soft drink (crushed ice) for $7 and something cents.  Apparently, it's their most popular.  Quit thinking about it, go get some! Look for the logo of a dog with shades on.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/52sY8-9al5LJi475nNJkyQ?select=VFGVABajhQN8F2M4suGwdA"}
{"text":"This place is a really popular attraction we heard about, so when we planned on going to Las Vegas, we knew we had to stop by. The restaurant itself was pretty big. Since we were a big group we decided to order to go. We ordered the Hard Hat and passed on the cole slaw, so we got all Texas Toast. I loved it. The boneless chicken was so scrumptious. I like not working around the bone for my food, plus there's often leftover meat on those bones. The toast was delicious too! I ate more than my fair share of toast. We ordered a Pan of Crinkle-Cut Fries, which is essentially five orders of fries. Those complemented the rest of the meal so well! We chose a great place for dinner and I suggest anyone else interested in trying it out, does. Definitely making this a priority when I come back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"One of my favorite fast food stops in Vegas. Was pleased to see a new location in Henderson! Went through the drive thru and received great, quick, & friendly service."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite chicken fingers! So far this place has the most delicious juicy crunchy tasty chicken fingers I have ever had! You can tell it actually came from a chicken breast! The menu here at Cane's is simple, you want chicken fingers with fries, coleslaw, Texas toast, or as a sandwich? Why complicate things? At least everything on the menu is good even the drinks! I love their sweet tea, and also their fresh squeezed lemonade, made fresh from real lemons everyday, (which by the way is not refillable and cost a few quarters more). Their secret ranch/ketchup/pepper dipping sauce is pretty bomb too, and if you want extra it's .50c more too, but hey am not complaining coz I LOVE their food! Also if you read up on their history it's pretty interesting too. So definitely try this place out if you haven't yet you are definitely missing out."}
{"text":"We love chicken. We love Cane's chicken. Every time we are in town we make sure to stop in. We aren't coleslaw fans, so we always sub for the Texas toast . Chicken fingers are awesome. Crinkle fries are awesome. Cane's sauce is tasty. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"im a die-hard fan of chicken strips so i finally tried raising canes the other day...i was long overdue...anyhow i drive-thru-ed it cuz i was lazy and i got the 3 strips box with fries and texas toast with a sweet tea. i gotta say it was pretty frickin awesome. that cane sauce has crack in it i think because i was licking it out of the little packet thingy. anyhow the chicken strips tasted yummy cuz they were freshly fried (at least thats what the lady told me in the drive thru cuz i had to wait) anyhow the service was bomb- like i said i had to wait but the lady stayed at the window and shot the breeze with me while i waited...that was cool. if you get a drink do youreself a favor and get the sweet tea....SO YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! The red head girl was very well mannered & the food was freshly made!"}
{"text":"My first encounter with Raising Cane's was in Louisiana and when I came back to the West Coast, I was literally on the hunt to find this place but never did I accomplish! That was, until my trip to Las Vegas baby! I love this place, everything is fresh and never frozen! Their sweet tea is tasty! Too bad this place just has to be so far away from me, oh how I miss you so."}
{"text":"I received service for Dylan W. He was very helpful and very nice working the window! I ordered the Caniac box and substituted the slaw for extra canes sauce with no problem. All around the food is really really good. Little on the unhealthy side but I love it! Good place to goto with friends! I had trouble on the website on how to activate my canes card for points. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"If you want a basic fast meal this perfect for you. The chicken fingers are amazing! I've been in Arizona for 4 days and have been twice already."}
{"text":"I preface this review by noting that I'm not a fan of fried food in general, especially chicken.   Raising Cane's is actually quite tasty. I just don't understand the hype. They are pretty basic and although they taste ok, I don't anticipate making them a staple in my dining rotation. The dipping sauce is nothing amazing, but it does go well with the chicken. The fries are very meh. They're not crispy in the least and lack flavor. If I was going to eat here again, I'd probably only order the chicken and skip the fries.   All in all, just ok but it's a good alternative to some fast food joints in town."}
{"text":"I'm not really a big fan of Raising Cane's, but my friend wanted to meet here for lunch earlier this week so I thought it'd be nice to try something different in the area.   We arrived during the peak lunch hours and the place was packed. Despite the long line, the cashiers got the line moving quite quickly and were busy bussing tables to get them cleared for new customers. I was really impressed by the good customer service and teamwork I witnessed at this location.   We got our meals quickly and happily ate our chicken fingers while we chatted. I'm still not a huge fan of the food, but I do like the sauce and Texas toast they serve with it.   The manager even came by while we ate to check on us and make sure everything was ok."}
{"text":"OMG, this the the BEST freaking fried chicken I've ever had, and I don't even particularly like fried chicken! I went here twice on my last Vegas trip. That itself already says something. Especially in a place like Vegas with billions of restaurants I would normally like to try different places every time. This place was so good that I just had to go again.   I HOPE HOPE HOPE that this chain can make it to California some day. If I had the money, I would be on that right now!"}
{"text":"Cane's sauce is addicting. Good service, quick and juicy chicken. Never had an order be wrong, cold or gross."}
{"text":"I had Raising Cane's in Texas and I wasn't really a fan, but I think the Tempe Raising Cane's deserves props for a few reasons:  1.) They are open on weekends and have consistent hours (they were the second place we tried to go to for chicken fingers that was supposed to be open). 2.) They have pretty decent prices. 3.) Their Cane sauce is pretty delish.  NOTABLE: The restaurant was WAY clean.  I witnessed the tables getting bussed promptly and cleaned off with cleaner and PAPER TOWELS.  This is huge.  They also sprayed and wiped down the benches.  The employees were super duper!  I was being a counter space hog and filling three drinks when an employee came up to refill the iced tea.  I didn't notice him at first, but when I did he told me to take my time.  Then he noticed I needed a lid for the child cup I had and asked if I would like one.  He promptly went and got me the lid before returning to refill the iced tea.  What a great employee!  I wish I had caught his name!  *The only reason I don't give them five stars is that Rock N Roll Fingers, a local business, has fingers that are about 50% bigger for nearly the same price.  They also have multiple sauce options.  If they had been open last Saturday, I would have eaten there.  Alas, they were closed at 1 p.m. on a day that they were listed as open.  :/  Bad for them, good for Cane's!"}
{"text":"There isn't anything negative I can say about this place or the food. The cooks and cashiers do their jobs properly, the food is fantastic, and the employees are quick to clean the place once a rush happens. They play 80s-00s music in the background and they are the radio hits (no rap which sucks, but I listen to my own music anyway). Bottom line is if you like chicken fingers and there's one near you, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I came here orders the 3 finger combo..comes with 3 fried chicken fingers,  crinkle fries, and a piece of garlic bread. The chicken itself was really good just a little oiler than I would like but definitely 100x better than KFC. They only have chicken fingers and chicken sandwich so if you want something different this isn't the place for you. Plus they have some tailgate options with larger portions for parties. But I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, tasty very fair priced.  You can count on the same level of food and service from each location - a great thing to know when traveling"}
{"text":"fresh chicken and the dipping sauce is awesome. sounds funny but they have the best ice for drinks"}
{"text":"Went there on grand opening day at 6:00 pm and was busy as can be and it only got worst by 6:30 pm with the parking lot and drive thru in gridlock.   Chicken stripes as fresh as can be. We shared the Caniac Combo, substituted the slaw and got extra french fries. The chicken is always consistent, fresh white meat. I am a dark meat person would love for Raising Canes to offer dark chicken meat sometime in the future,  but their white meat is juicy and not dry.  The biggest tip is you have to get their lemonade which is awesome!   The strangest tip would be if you are an ice chewer,  they have the best ice with their drinks. The ice is perfect for chewing since it is soft and will not break all your teeth.  The service is quick and the people are very helpful and make you feel welcome.   Glad this location opened up by our house and will be coming here many more times."}
{"text":"The food is good and affordable, but the atmosphere there is horrible.  The employees are screaming and so loud that I wasn't even able to hear the music they play where you eat."}
{"text":"I don't normally leave bad reviews but I expected so much more. I come to canes at least twice a week, and always get great service. But today the girl at the drive through was awful. She got irritated that it was supposed to be two separate orders and didn't smile once. I get it's the morning but I go to canes for the smiling faces and great food and she just made me want to cancel the whole order and go somewhere else. Worst experience ever she should not be working the drive threw or any register at all if she has poor customer service. My receipt says her name was Kayleigh."}
{"text":"YUMMY. I love chicken tenders so I was happy to find a fast food place that specializes in it! I always try to come here when I'm in Vegas.  Chicken tenders are crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Their batter is just right - not too thick. Cane sauce is a MUST. Don't know what's in there but it is delicious. Sweet tea perfectly compliments the meal.   Raising Cane's, please open one in LA."}
{"text":"I really love there service and food they are great workers and really care about all there customers"}
{"text":"I thought I had reviewed this before.  Perhaps not life changing... but just some darn good chicken fingers.  A bunch of chicken fingers with some fries, some cane's sauce, and some lemonade from here is a darn tasty meal to me.  Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"I really like their chicken strips; it's prolly favorite.  The chicken is hot and fresh, not processed.  The breading is crunchy and just the right thickness and amount.  The sauce is particularly yummy and the fries are really good too."}
{"text":"New franchise whose menu is based on simplicity. There is only one sauce for their chicken and if you want extra you are gonna pay. Chicken shack has better fries and a dozen sauces which they don't charge extra for. Unfortunately they are only located in Henderson and Boulder City. I'd chose Cain based on a lack off alternatives."}
{"text":"One of the good chicken fast food restaurants I have been to. I think because it reminds me of Zaxbys so much. The best part is the sauce. Goes with anything chicken, fries, bread, anything. The plate is very filling. Chicken is breaded. I believe there can be less breading but I guess that's what makes it what it is. Even with the breading the chicken is soft and tasty."}
{"text":"Well. I must say. I'm disappointed. Tried this place for the first time since moving to Nevada after hearing it was good for a quick stop. Waiting quite a while in line and this very energetic fellow (Nathan) took my order. When I got to the window, the girl was very dry and lacked personality. Ordered 2 sprites to go with, got sprite and coke even after correcting them 3 times.  Service was slow, food was dry and didn't taste that great, bread was soggy. Sorry Caines, you don't get my recommendation. I'll give you guys a second chance sometime, but it'll be a while."}
{"text":"1st time here and I have to saw I am impressed! The menu is very simple. Chicken finger combos, the sweet tea is amazing! And they have the yummy crushed ice! I went with the Box combo cause I wanted to try the coleslaw. We came just at the right time because after we got a booth the line was going out the door! Our food came to the table by the sweetest little employee. He brought us Heinz and extra napkins. I have to saw that next take in in Vegas I'll swing by here again totally worth the prices!"}
