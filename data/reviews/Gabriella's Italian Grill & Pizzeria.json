{"text":"This place has great homemade Italian food & a great atmosphere . If you want great  homemade Italian food, not Olive Garden processed food .. Go here! Delish!"}
{"text":"Not good.    Italian Sausage had the strangest texture... Almost mealy.  Garlic bread lacked garlic... Even when we requested more garlic, it came back with more butter but not garlic.  Lame!  My friend ordered the \"lasagna\". It looked like lasagna but had absolutely no flavor.  I wouldn't Come back for the food  but I would for the band.  They rocked!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my wife and daughter and was pretty pleased with everything, especially given that I am pretty fussy when it comes to Italian food. The service was more than accommodating and the interior was a real surprise, definitely feeling a little more upscale than most Italian restaurants in strip malls. The bar set up was pretty cool too and good to grab something to eat and watch a game and have a drink. We ordered the calzone, they have family size portions and after splitting this between my wife and myself, we still had a little to take home! It was actually one of the best calzones I have had in a while, had plenty of ingredients and the dough was tasty. My wife's family had owned a pizza restaurant for years and she loved it! Given the food, service, ambience and price, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We at here again tonight. My husband got the linguine and clams and said it was absolutely delicious. I had the lasagna and it was so good. We also started with the Zia's potato and sausage soup, it was so good. Service is also great."}
{"text":"Everything my husband and I have ordered from here has been super delicious. We love pizza and this has to be our fav pizza place. A little pricey but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome! yum yum good!  Its located right next to the movie theatre and we were hungry after the movie.  Atmosphere was great and the food was too.  Zucchini fritts were crunchy and tasty. Salad was good. The shrimp scampi was so  so flavorful!  There could have been a wee bit most pasta on the dish since they say it's family style orders.,,but good.  Will return."}
{"text":"First of all, here's a shout-out to Kyle, who was super awesome and friendly, and happens to share the same cool namesake as me! Thanks for taking such good care of us!  We had a monstrous craving for quality pizza on a late Monday evening and happened across this place around 8. It was near empty and quiet, but the staff was warm and welcoming all the same. The atmosphere is nice and \"classic Italian\", and the place just has a nice cozy feel all around.   We ordered one of their main pizzas, which included house salads and garlic bread (with a delicious and tangy balsamic to dip them in!).   Everything was delivered in the perfect amount of time. In spite of the late hours, the salad was fresh, crisp, and refreshing. Not too much, nor too little Italian dressing. The garlic bread too, was a warm and welcome appetizer. It was quite tempting to fill up on it before the pizza even arrived, but we took special care not to. We were here for the pie, after all! ;)  The pizza itself was EXACTLY what we were looking for. It was placed before us on an elevated frame in the middle of the table, steaming fresh out of the oven. The pie was loaded with wholesome toppings like olives, mushrooms, and tomatoes, and the cheese was melted and gooey to perfection! That's all I can really say. It's just. Good. Pizza. We could't finish it all and ended up taking it home, and it still tasted every bit as awesome.   We also ended up getting some pistachio gelato to take home, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, it was nothing short of absolutely delicious.   This is a great place for pizza made with care and friendly service. I hear there's some live music sometimes (we missed it this time) and the pasta's also good, so we're definitely gonna come back for that. :)"}
{"text":"I tried to order a pizza for delivery. After an hour I called and was told that they had not even made the pizza and that it would take another 25 minutes. Avoid this place at all costs. There are so many other options that won't lie to you."}
{"text":"The food was delicious; calamari for appetizer, sicilian pizza and the best turamisu to finish, everything was fresh and full of flavor, they have a nice patio to enjoy a beautiful night out. But the real highlight of our visit was the outstanding service provided by our server Manny, he was very professional and had so much knowledge about wine, he made our night very special and memorable! if you go to Gabriella's ask for Manny :) he is the best!"}
{"text":"The service wasn't even lousy - it was non-existent. After sitting there for 20 minutes waiting for someone, anyone--Hello?-- to greet us, we decided the wait staff was just too busy to bother with us. The food looked great, but not so great when other people are eating it and no one is around to take an order. Busy place but you better know someone if you want to eat there......."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great, service was excellent and the entertainment was wonderful. My family and I will be back again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for awhile.  Service was great, nice little spot.  Down side is both myself and dinner companion experienced gastro issues soon after leaving.  We both tried different meals......so uncertain if it was something they use to cook with that disagreed with both of us.  Price is standard overpriced meals for Vegas.  Nothing is cheap here....so complaining about over priced meals in Vegas is like complaining about too much heat in the summer......it is what it is."}
{"text":"This only received two stars because the asparagus was awesome otherwise it would be one star.  Nonna Rose's White Pie: Threw it away - either the pancetta was old or it as really bad quality.  Meatball Sub: awful (tasted like bad meatloaf) Crispy Asparagus: Awesome!!! Fried Mozzarella: Good (but really greasy) but sauce was not good"}
{"text":"This place is so good I wish I wasn't telling you about it. 80 beers, great service from Liam at the bar, great wines and a cool bar. The food is so very italian and with a twist. My secret recipe meat sauce that I thought only I knew is is enhanced seriously by Donnie and was so good. Try their signature pizzas.  Don't go, leave it for me. John"}
{"text":"We love this place. Hard to find a restaurant that my young boys like going to and enjoy the food. Wife and I are tired of Chili's.  The gelato is fantastic. The Italian Nachos are a must.  Wow! Something on the menu for everyone. Staff is very friendly and fun.   Stuffed!"}
{"text":"It's always been a great time going to Gabriella's. All their food is delicious from the appetizers to the entree's. Their food is homemade everyday from fresh ingredients. We go with friends as it is so nice to have a family restaurant that doesn't feel like Vegas. It's a great place to sit, eat and drink with friends. They even have live entertainers on some nights, a piano player and a Frank Sinatra impersonator make for a nice atmosphere. The patio is great bonus when the weather is nice....  We've always had such great food there that we had a Xmas party in their private room. They helped lay out some nice family style dishes and everyone went home stuffed!! It is a nice intimate room just off the main dining room so you can still hear the music in the background and doesn't feel like your off in a dungeon. It is easy for the servers to get in from the back so the service was great. Thanks Elias!!    They have a great happy hour with something like 24 beers on tap and food specials. . It's not a video poker bar so everyone sits around and chats, something that is such a nice change from most Vegas bars. Like I said, it's great to finally have a nice friendly neighborhood restaurant with such good food and service.   Keep up the great work Gabriella's !!"}
{"text":"Sister Inlaw and I were having a movie night so we stopped here to grab some food can I sAy I loved it and will be back we got the rat pack pizza and the carbonara pasta and they were both amazing!!!! Since we ordered to go the guy who took our order was extremely nice and friendly helped us decide and even gave us a house salad for free and when gave us our food he offered to help us bring it to the car since we ordered a lot for 2 people lol honestly not many places am I very pleased with but this place was really good and I loved how we got our food fast I can't wait to stop by again"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at this restaurant, the food was nothing to write home about. It's the service that irritated us. The service was possibly trying to be attentive, but we had 6 DIFFERENT restaurant employees check in on our table multiple times (we didn't know who our waiter was because every time someone else came out). We order a large pizza (so/so) and had leftovers - the kicker? There are about 1000 pizza boxes \"decorating\" the restaurant, but the waiter brings out a styrofoam dinner container, stacks our remaining pizza slices on top of each other and crams it into the container. Without asking for additional drinks or dessert we're presented the bill. For the next 10 minutes our waiter passed by 15 times looking to see if we'd put our card in the flap. It was a slow night, this was so over the top that we never want to go back."}
{"text":"Homemade food amazing. And Krista our server was great. Love the atmosphere and close to home. Will def be back!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today for the first time and it was delicious! Husband and I shared the Sicilian personal pizza off the lunch menu, it was absolutely delicious, especially the sausage! We also shared the Parmesan chicken panini with fries and the ketchup tasted homemade. Great spot. We will be back with the kids. Personal pizza was so big that even sharing we still brought home three slices."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time last night. I was greeted by a very friendly staff  very helpful. I ordered some food to go I had the margherita pizza and chicken piccata. The pizza was fabulous the chicken however, was a little over cooked. The portion was great and everything else was awesome.  I really liked the atmosphere and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We have had the pleasure of eating at Gabriella's several times and it is always a great experience. Salads and pizzas are very fresh! The balsamic garlic dipping sauce is great! The service is exceptional! Kyle gave great suggestions and made our experience fun!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family after the gym, we filled up on some good carbs, shrimp linguine, spaghetti, calamari, bread,  salad and wine and more importantly family time. Kyle our waiter was  helpful, courteous attentive to our party. We will definitely be coming back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"We just went today for a to go order had a beer at the bar nice happy hour 2.50 pints coooool"}
{"text":"Very great service and food, especially the grilled chicken Caesar salad I had.  Loved the mob-style music I heard as I entered and the place even airing such movies such as Guys and Dolls and an old Edward G. Robinson classic (title I never picked up)."}
{"text":"This place sucks the garlic bread is just toasted bland bread, the homemade sausage and I use that word loosely is disgusting! The soda had no fizz the lemonade was bland not sweet nor tart! The waiter did not listen to our order because he brought out a salad loaded with vinegar! They also have children in the kitchen area! When I say children I mean little kids how unprofessional and dangerous as well. Flavorless food! I gave it one star because I have to so I can post this review but quite honestly I wouldn't give it a star at all!  The live music was good that is the only positive thing I can say about this place. Do not go here you will regret it. I do appreciate the chef coming to the table and apologizing about the food but it doesn't change the fact that the food was terrible."}
{"text":"The food is good. The bread was burnt. The service was awful. Made a comment about the sun shining through the Window right into our eyes and made a comment about it and was ignored. Had to ask the blond hostess( a true blond may I add) to close the blinds. They did have 1 good server named Dustin. Only with I had him for a server."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town. 24 awesome beers on tap and from 4-7pm they are half off. That's $2.50 for a Kilt Lifter Scotch Ale. Great food, and the bartender Liam always knows how to tempt my pallet with a new beer. I hate microbrews, or at least I thought I did. Liam can expand your boundaries.  Live music always, too"}
{"text":"We have dined here before and loved it, best pizza we've ever had.  We came in Monday for dessert and cappuccino. We asked for cannoli and we were told they were out. Instead of letting us walk away, Devin, the manager found two cannoli shells and made the filling on the spot for us.   It was absolutely delicious. The customer service and family appeal is second to none.   Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Food quality, good. Service, great. Price for food, not bad. Like the atmosphere. Would definitely come back before movie night again."}
{"text":"Very good! This was our first time at Gabriella's, and we will be back again. It was a very affordable meal for a family of 4. We all enjoyed the house salad, too."}
{"text":"We held a birthday celebration at Gabriella's recently. Great atmosphere. The restaurant nods toward the great days of the Rat Pack Vegas style; in decor, menu items, & Music. The 'ol-blue-eyes' entertainer was very good and went out of his way to have the whole place sing the Birthday song; and they did!  Varied & thoughtful menu. Nice to see a restaurant with appropriate meal sizes, rather than the default, excess is best strategy - not skimpy, just right. Food had excellent flavor from Italian Nachos, to Chicken, to pasta. We all had a great time."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed! For being open for only 2 months, Gabrielle's seems to be doing well for itself. Situated on a quiet corner next to the freeway, the restaurant has a beautiful ambiance with a piano included for the night crowd.  Delicious food, I recommend coming here during the lunch hour. It's quiet and the service is more personal.  My only problem is the dill dip that comes with the fried portobello mushrooms. It's not very dilly.  I was presented with a coupon for $5.00 off an entrée and free fried mozzarella. I will be visiting here again, with that coupon in hand, and may update my review with 5 stars. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Let's just say this was one of the most delicious Italian meals my husband and I have had in Las Vegas. Dustin was poised and elegant in his service on a Sunday afternoon making excellent suggestions for our dinner. My partner enjoyed ravioli which was filled with a Savory well seasoned filling which surprised me! There was an abundant amount of gnocchi in a perfectly textured cream garlic wine sauce to make me happy. we love to split tiramisu and were not disappointed with the small order. The large size is huge."}
{"text":"I brought my daughter to dine at Gabriella's the other night after we went to see a movie at the theater next door to the restaurant. We ordered a pesto chicken pizza to share. It was wonderful! I always love how nice the staff treats me when I walk through the door. Our server was so cool, he asked for our movie ticket stubs and returned with complimentary small servings of the most wonderful gelato. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"Sucks, calamari was so greasy we told this to our server he did nothing about it, that was the last time we saw the server, we couldn't get refills on our drinks, food was not good we left our food went and ate somewhere else."}
{"text":"Okay so here goes my review as you know I'm trying to find the best Italian food in Las Vegas been several Italian restaurants and montesano's is still the best I've had in Las Vegas the pizza here which was a pepperoni lovers was a good pizza but if you're going to have a pepperoni lovers Pizza put a lot more pepperoni on it the spaghetti meatballs the meatballs were very good good flavor however the marinara sauce was a little too sweet in my opinion the garlic bread was very dry and not very garlicky the house salad had a good flavor to it very simple salad but good all in all not the best Italian food I've ever had but good ambience and very very good service."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza and is very clean. Service was good except for messing up my order a little. They were very apologetic about it. A little pricey but you pay for the ambience.  Also tried the tiramisu which was very good. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Have been there twice now.  There were issues, but they resolved them  First time they served Stromboli...the bottom was completely burned.  When we told them they replaced, but how did they serve it in the first place?  Second issue was we had a coupon for a free desert for each entree.  So we ordered two.  They charged for the second... and I hope they charged double, because 6 bucks for two very small scoops is excessive.  did not say anything because it did not seem worth it.  And my final issue is probably completely personal.  They have a man playing piano live.  I found it to be intrusive and annoying.  I could not hear my dinner companion speaking.  I don't want to have to talk over music, if they have to have him playing, they should substantially lower the volume.  With all that being written I will go back, because I did enjoy my food."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, service and food were excellent! Nice ambiance when you walked in. We were greeted and sat immediately on a Saturday night. The server was attentive and personable. We were checked up on after every course. We ordered the garlic parm wings and the Roma pizza. Both were excellent! Great selection of beers for those who like good beer. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome find! Heard from a friend about this little gem. The atmosphere is adorable! Great little bar. Awesome service. The wait staff and management were soooooo nice and attentive. I loved the bread and salad that came with our meals. My sister had the Alfredo, which was different because it was really peppery. I had the pesto, which was very light and yummy. If you're looking or something different than the usual Italian places, give this one a try. Pairing this restaurant with the candy store next door and a movie would be a GREAT date night!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! The pizza is the best. Dave Davis (GM) took great care of us. Definitely coming back with family."}
{"text":"Love the service here. They were very nice and accommodating. We ordered take out and they gave us extra stuff. The food was good and fresh. We really enjoyed it. Will definitely come back when we are in town again."}
{"text":"Details: -Saturday night, 7pm -Patio  -Party of 15   Service: We had a sweet waitress who really was trying to give great service. (I'm not sure why the restaurant didn't use 2 servers for our large party). A few meals were forgotten and our server didn't take orders in any particular order, so it was a bit chaotic. Once we were all settled with our food, our server was attentive and filled our drinks regularly. A few times a man who appeared to be the manager/owner came out to inquire about our meal and experience. That was nice. Again at the end of the meal, there was much confusion about who had what food, and what check it was on. . (I was a server for a few years, and I know it can be difficult)   Food: The food was ok. The owner said everything is made from scratch which was great to hear. I was feeling simple and ordered the fettecini Alfredo. It was meh, but didn't exceed expectations.  It was normal but definitely tasty. The best thing I tasted were the Italian nachos (app) . It was amazing!!  Awkward Experience: This was so weird and awkward! So they had a Frank Sinatra impersonator as the entertainment.  We were the only table out on the patio where his little stage was, and thus the only audience. (our table was literally 3 Ft from him and his speaker) My family just wanted to visit and talk amongst ourselves but this guy kept trying to interact and make jokes, which would have been great if we were susceptible to it. He kept making passive comments hinting that we didn't like him and other weird things. At one point my aunt asked him if he could please turn down the music so she didn't have to yell across the table, he was noticeably bothered and just made it awkward. Eventually our server picked up on it and the manager came out to ask him to perform inside. But as the manager was urging him inside he called out \"you guys really don't want me out here?!\".  Talk about uncomfortable. We didn't request entertainment. It would have been totally fine if he just sang and didn't try to be all interactive to a large group that wanted To talk and visit. And then he started smoking while singing very close to our table. So we got to smell his smoke while we ate. We were all so frustrated and uncomfortable.   Wrap-up: I hope the establishment gets a handle on Mr. Sinatra. He was quite a detraction from what could have been a comfortable and nice evening."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place from the staff to the amazing food to the atmosphere. I love the live entertainment. Great family restaurant!!! Vegas needs more places like this!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the food was pretty good, but deceiving menu and charges led to a lower rating.  Menu states that Pizza comes with family style house salad and garlic bread with the option to upgrade to Caesar salad for 3 dollars more. This translates to two individual salads with a 6 dollar total upgrade charge. I'm not even going into the politics of salad differences.  Pizza came out with toppings wrong.  It was one of our parties birthday, and the hostess stated that she would get a brownie. Instead they brought out a 9 dollar tiramisu. It was delicious, just not 9 dollars delicious. Especially when we didn't order it.  Overall decent food, just be careful about hidden costs.  Edit: Talked to manager and he refunded the Tiramisu. Said its not the way they operate."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour tonight. Bartender seemed pretty stiff & stuffy (nose in the air). They were out of a couple of the beers we wanted so we had to opt for second choice. Ordered happy hour personal size pizza and opted to add an extra topping to it. When pizza came out it is large definitely worth the $8. But it was not warm cheese was already set and it just did not taste very good. It didn't have good flavor. And it was greasy. Crust was too soggy. I actually brought it home and put it in my own oven and crisp up the crust more. Metro way better. $2.50 beers are an OK deal. Don't think I will return there's nothing that makes me want to."}
{"text":"Very good pepperoni pizza, the crust is just right with quality ingredients on top of it. They only have one size of pizza but it big enough for 4 people. It came with a salad and garlic bread and a vinegar/olive oil dressing. Friendly service and no problems parking close. They have a bar setup and indoor and outdoor seating. I like Grimaldis up the street  at Eastern and Richmar also but I think this will be a regular stop now as the parking lot in Grimaldis can get full from the other restaurants in its area."}
{"text":"WOW! Second best pizza I've had in Vegas thus far.   The cheese blend on 'The Leaning Tower of Cheeza'; provolone, mozzarella, cheddar and parmesan, was super rich and creamy. I almost went into a cheese coma. We added pepperoni to this pizza, but the cheese was so good, it really didn't need it. I WILL be eating this pizza again very soon. You get a salad to share and garlic bread with every pizza order, so a complete meal for around $20. SCORE!  Service was went well above and beyond. Located in a shopping center with a movie theater, they will offer to hold your leftover pizza in their fridge so you can enjoy your movie and come back to pick up your leftovers. I've never heard of a restaurant doing this, and I think it's a phenomenal idea."}
{"text":"Good food, great service (Thanks Manny and Dustin!) and fun live music!  This has already become a regular hang for us!"}
{"text":"Nice place with really friendly staff. The bartender/waiter Jonathan is very attentive to patrons in the bar area and very friendly to everyone. Spoke to a waitress as well and she explained the favorites in the menu with good detail. The butter bread and balsamic is really good. Bruschetta appetizer was okay, a little in the pricy side for just 6 small pieces of bread and tomato. Food plates come in generous portions, definitely take home left overs. Overall, food lacks taste and this place is not favorable in price."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back! Great food, I like the decor, and the vibe. The owner came to our table and welcomed me and my guest. Our waitress was very pleasant and very attentive. The food was great! I ordered the fettuccine alfredo, a sausage and mushroom pizza, and their calamari as an appetizer. My meal was delicious! I visited from California and I'm definitely coming back when I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"This newly opened restaurant came to our attention through Yelp and we are glad it did. Great service, delicious food, and large portions helped justify the slightly inflated prices. The draft and bottle list had ~30 different varieties and the wine seemed reasonably priced. Along with your normal expectations for an Italian restaurant (salad and bread with your meal), Gabriella's also included cheese, olive, and pepper plate.  Our entrees were quite large and we were told the desserts are all homemade (we were too full to try them).  This place is worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Their garlic bread (free with an entree), pizza, and homemade ravioli were amazing! Also loves the atmosphere of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"On the recommendation of close friends we tried it again. Fourth time was the charm. New management & chef.  The food was much improved. If you like great microbrews sit at the bar where Liam provides great service & knows the beers."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery!!!! When we ordered, we were given a delivery time of 25-30 minutes. We called after 45 and were told they were running a little late. We called again after an hour wait, and we were told the delivery guy was 20 minutes away and that they hadn't started our pizza yet... We canceled the order. We promised our two year old pizza for dinner... She got a frozen pizza instead of Gabriella's. I think we will go to the trouble to making our own next time we want quality food."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, i was born in Italy...my whole family is Italian.,...grew up there and moved to America when i was younger.....the only reason i say this is to be able to QUALIFY this review.....basically saying...WE KNOW ITALIAN FOOD, AND HOW IT SHOULD BE!  Went here with my fiance...he ordered the meatball sandwich and i got fried calamari and the portobella stick appetizers.....the server was not too bad, he was a little pushy but we can overlook that....when my calamari came, i was a bit turned off by the breading....if you have had real Italian calamari you would know that we use flour, not bread crumbs, on fried calamari...its just how they are made....for a place that claims to be \"authentic\" Italian...that bothered me...i took a bite, and had to look down to make sure it was calamari i had eaten, and not an eraser! pure rubber! ok, i thought, let me try a few more pieces, maybe that one was bad....NOPE..they were all RUBBER RUBBER RUBBER! hard as hell, and not to mention flavorless....very typical of old, non-fresh, and previously frozen calamari.....when the waiter came over to ask how everything was, i told him that they were pretty rubbery, and did not seem fresh to me....to which he replied \"oh thats how they are, they are fresh, its how they are made in italy\" haaaaaaahahaha.....i just let his comment go in one ear, smiled, and looked away...i was in no mood to let him know how severely mistaken he was.....when my fiance's meatball dish came out....they screwed it up and brought him the dinner....which was about double the price of the sandwich, that he had REALLY ordered....he was pretty upset because he did not want the whole dinner with the pasta, etc...he just wanted a simple sandwich...regardless, he took a taste....it tasted like tomato sauce from a can...it was very sweet sauce...and he simply did not enjoy it.....when the server came around to check again my fiance let him know that he didnt want the meal, that he had ordered the sandwich instead....the server just said...oh im sorry about that....and walked away....did not offer to make it up to us in any way....needless to say we did not enjoy our meal...for claiming to be an authentic italian place, they should do some research on what Italian food is, and not try to fool us by serving us pre frozen foods...im honestly shocked at how many good reviews this place has gotten...the prices are outrageously high, for not very enjoyable foods...."}
{"text":"Amazing in every sense.  Food, customer service, ambiance--they have it all.  We picked up pizza tonight for my husband's birthday and it was an all around awesome experience.  They were a bit behind so instead of having my mom just sit in the lobby they gave her a tour of the restaurant.  The pizza was phenomenal (had the five cheese and the white pizza with pancetta) and came with salad and bread.  We had 4 hungry adults and 2 kids and had lots of leftovers so the food goes a long way.  I'm officially moving on from Grimaldis and moving up with Gabriella's.  I just hope it gets the local support such an awesome business deserves!!!"}
{"text":"The best place who ever writes a bad review about this place doesn't know what they are talking about.  Authentic as they come.  East coast style Italian restaurant.  Makes me feel like I'm back home in Detroit on old Woodward eating out.  Hands down the best in LAS VEGAS."}
{"text":"12 oz. beer for $2.50 at the bar every night from 4-7. Goes great with a personal pizza for only $8.  Great deal, come here all the time. Live music as well!"}
{"text":"Food is good (not like it use to be) however since the New owners food and service have gone down hill. I use to love this place ... Not so now - I will drive further from my house for Italian food! Sorry - but Much better places up Eastern to eat. What Happened ?"}
{"text":"We have eaten here for a total of 3 times now (in order to give a fair review).  The first time we ate here for lunch it was so good that we came back the second time.  The second time we came...it was not so good so we gave it a second chance during our 3rd visit.  Unfortunately our 3rd visit will be our last as there is too many inconsistencies.  1st visit: We ordered a pizza with pepperoni, onions, and sausage.  It was perfect!  The cheese and crust was cooked to perfection.  It was also served with strips of garlicbread and a side salad for each.  We also ordered the calamari which was good...but nothing special.  2nd visit: We ordered a pizza with pepperoni only.  The pizza came out \"warm\"...the cheese didn't even stretch as we served it.  I don't know about you but We like our pizza piping hot out of the oven...and the waiter this time told us that the restaurant just got a new oven so he would let the new Chef know what our feedback was.  3rd visit: We were so hungry that we ordered the Venetian wings and a sausage/mushroom pizza.  We were served a family style salad and a basket of garlic bread.  After about 45 minutes of waiting for our wings, we asked teh waiter to check on it and he told us that the wings take longer because they serve \"Colossal wings\" and want to make sure it is cooked perfectly.  5 minutes later he arrives at our table with the pizza and the wings.  The wings were NOT and I repeat NOT colossal in size at all.  I was also served barely warm.  The pizza again was not piping hot as the cheese did not stretch.  We really wanted to like this place...but I guess we will have to find another local pizzaria!"}
{"text":"Great authentic food. Server was a little slow but the food was worth the wait. Very good. Family friendly atmosphere. Will come back!"}
{"text":"I'd give it 0 stars if I could. Terrible service. Food took almost an hour and half to come out of the kitchen. All but 1 in our party of 5 sent their food back as some were prepared wrong and every non-marinara sauce was completely watered down. We all sent the salad back. Dressing was heavy, saturated and tastes purely of vinegar. The Sinatra impersonator was so cheesy and not that good. Avoid this place at all costs.  PS, did I mention that they had run out of manicotti and shrimp and about the only things left were spaghetti and chicken? Also it was the end of our meal and no one brought the garlic bread to us. We had given up even caring at that point."}
{"text":"For a new restaurant this place was amazing...in fact, it was great no matter how I look at it.  Service was top notch and the environment was very tasteful and modern with an outdoor seating area available too.  There were three of us and we all ordered entres.  It came with a cheese plate, salad and garlic bread...all of which were delicious.  My lasagna was extremely good, my wife's shrimp pasta was delicious and our friends chicken parmigiana was excellent.  They offered up a nice desert selection, but by the end of the meal we were all way too full to attempt it.  By about half way through the meal we were already plotting our return and discussing how thankful we were that a fine new Italian restaurant was now close by in Henderson."}
{"text":"Like many others, I thought this place would a great addition to the plaza.  I was wrong. To begin with, the service was poor. Our waiter was bussing tables and then serving others without washing his hands. However, we got lucky as the chef(cook) delivered our food as the waiter had disappeared for a few minutes. We could see our order on the rack behind the glass, but the chef(cook) realized the waiter wasn't there so he delivered it himself.    OK, on to the food. We ordered a meatball sandwich(11.00) and a child's portion  of spaghetti with a meatball(7.00). My gf and I wanted to try what should be signature dishes. The meatballs were ok. However, The bread did not appear homemade.  An Italian restaurant should never use packaged rolls. Also, the sauce was very sweet and tasted like it may have been at least partially, from a can.  The sauce certainly DID NOT have that \"made from scratch\" taste and texture. There are some great Italian places close to here that offer MUCH better food."}
{"text":"I got the pizza lunch special. It was really good. That have good service and it was very clean and semi-quite. It is a very cute little restaurant with very nice employees. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood eatery. Greeted with a friendly hostess on a busy Friday night. Decided to sit at one of the tables in the bar. The bartender/server was well versed in the menu and gave us some good tips. We had the Mussels Italiano, one word, WOW! We will be back. Large selection of wine, drafts and bottles. We had a couple of Belgium beers that are seldom seen on menus elsewhere. Nice atmosphere, friendly and knowledgeable staff, great food! Five stars!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night - loved it.  I go to Colonnade a lot and was looking for somewhere to go before/after for eats.  Love Havana but the music is so loud you can't talk.  PT's has the WORST staff I have seen in a restaurant in a long time - the bottom feeders of the service industry.  Gabriella's is the polar opposite - the service was fantastic.  Our waitress Tiffani was very professional and treated us well.    The gentleman who explained the food couldn't have been nicer (Tom maybe?  Manager? Owner? Not sure).  Everything is made daily and the flavor totally speaks to that.  I had the lasagna and it was fantastic.  May be the best lasagna I've had outside of the East Coast.  My friend had the minestrone.  One of the kitchen employees passed by just after the food was served and suggested she try it with fresh ground pepper, she obliged, and said it really did make a difference.  She loved it.  In addition to our server, Tom (?), the pepper guy, and a few other employee's checked in and made sure we always had what we needed.  These people clearly understand what running a restaurant is all about.    You should expect to spend about $16-$20 per entree but the quality and service feel worth it.  They have a bar area that had a few TVs and it looked like you could get food service over there too.  I would highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Just bad. I went on Valentine's Day and it was a wreck. Service took forever, salad was drenched in vinegar. I asked for water without lemons, got lemons. Another person asked for lemons in their soda and got none. I ordered the deep fried calzone, which came with delicious garlic fries. I ordered the calzone with no mushrooms or peppers, and it was chalk-full of them. I am all for being lenient on holidays, but this was ridiculous. The chicken looked like the inside of a McDonalds nugget, and when someone ordered veal, they got beef. It was almost ground beef, but it was definitely not veal. The waitress tried her best, but it was a failing ship. The entrees that were supposed to have a side of garlic bread, but that never came. The Italian Nachos were pretty good, but the mozzarella sticks had very little cheese. They had two live singers. The first one flat out couldn't sing and the second was in a Frank Sinatra character, lip syncing everything, even with recorded cheering. The manager had to come in the end and comp the whole meal, so at least he knew that there was a problem. Not a good experience at all."}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients, delicious sauce on pizzas, and great brick oven flavor. Crust and mozz are high quality as well. 1st time we ate in and all was perfect, pizza was great and homemade pasta was amazing. Staff is unusually friendly for Las Vegas. Good warm service can be hard to find around here so that's a big plus. 2nd time was pickup, also super friendly service, and only issue was pizza was a little under cooked, somewhat doh-ey, still pretty good though. If they can get the cook time a little more consistent, it would be 5 star."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza here a few times combination pizza five out of five.  was really fresh not oily at all definitely using high end  ingredients. Had dinner interior spectacular. service was about a 3 1/2 needs some improvement but overall experience was really nice great job"}
{"text":"So, I want to start by specifically calling attention to our server, Kevin. He was stellar. Very attentive, very personable, he gave great suggestions, and was simply a delight.   My wife got the linguine with clams - and it was fantastic. TONS of clams in it, which is a good thing, and the sauce was buttery and garlicy and just scrumptious.   I had initially ordered the Uncle Tony's Tuna something. It looked appealing on the menu; I'll give it that much. What was served was absolutely loathsome. The combinations of flavors in that dish were the very definition of wrong.   However, in swoops Kevin, like a damn champ, giving me a suggestion which MORE than made up for my error in judgement on my first go 'round. The carbonara was top notch.  All told - we'll be back."}
{"text":"The lasagna and the manicotti is amazing. The server Manny was outstanding.  Phenomenal food for a great price. I will be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night with my lovely wife and mother.   Cozy, casual, (even romantic) gem of a place. I did not feel like I was in Vegas at all.   A soloist singer was belting out songs from the days of The Rat Pack. A tad too loud, but a nice touch that we enjoyed.   Our server was very attentive, pleasant, and helpful. You can tell that whoever does the hiring knows what to look for in employees.  My wife and I shared a white pizza called the Sicilian. I wanted a white pie, and this came as a recommendation. My mom got the sausage and peppers.   We were pleased to find that a house salad comes with most entree's. You can upgrade to a Cesar for $3 We all tried the house salad.  The salad was okay. The dressing tasted of mostly of wine vinegar which dominated the flavor of the salad. (a little crushed garlic, egg and anchovies goes a long way) Since it was offered for free, I did not care too much. I had extra freshly ground Parmesan cheese put on mine and it helped.  I enjoyed a Moretti draught, and the girls were drinking Chianti. The price for our beverages were $4.50 each which I thought was a good price.   Pizza.  MAGNIFICO!!! BRAVO!!! This place knows pizza!  Capicola ham, Italian sausage, Genoa salami, Fontina, Mozzarella, and Romano cheeses. The flavor of this pizza was beautified by the high quality Italian meats that topped it. Crust was thin, slightly charred, chewy and crispy. I asked for a side of olive oil just to finish off the ends. We devoured the whole thing and I was actually sad when it was gone.   Sausage & Peppers  Gabriella's makes their sausage in house. You can tell because it is so lean.  The presentation is nice. They stack a generous amount of links in a \"box shape\" on the plate with a side of your choice of pasta.  My mom loved the marinara sauce, but was not a fan of the sausage preparation.  I thought the sausage had a really good flavor profile. I could not tell if it was fennel or anise seed that was the dominating spice but I liked it a lot. They grill it here, so it is presented charred and with smoke flavor. (the owner/chef is from TX so I get it) Different from what us N.E. Italians are used to. But because the sausage is so lean, I think that it dried out from the grilling process. I find Boiling lean sausage first and then browning after keeps it moist. Still, I finished it with no worries. It went well with my frosty Moretti.   We passed on dessert, our server was quite the salesman but we resisted.   I REALLY REALLY REALLY like this place and will return.   I want to try a red pizza and possibly the lasagna (another recommendation). I don't think it will take much for a 4 star rating next time around.   Thank you Gabriella's for succeeding where so many others have failed.   Right Montesanos?"}
{"text":"Great service, bland uninteresting food.  Ordered the Chiken Parmesean Panini....the sauce was nearly tasteless, the chicken (pre breaded?), was very thin....somewhat saved by lots of cheese.  Nice atmosphere...but they need to step up the food.  I likely will not be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant has an excellent structure and potential. A nice bar, a little store on the side for take-outs and ice cream, and a room for small groups. The menu is fair to good. Could be improved with a couple of adjustments with variety for people that prefer leaner options or pasta al dente. Pizzas are very good. Sometimes there is live music with a good taste. Price is very good as well for the level of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! I ordered the chicken picatta and I must say the flavor was on point!  Very hard to find an Italian restaurant that knows how to season there food right.  The calamari was OK...next time we'll do the fried mozzarella.  The salad was good but didn't care for the dressing... Not to much taste.  Dessert we had the cheesecake and that was awesome!  Only reason I didn't give the establishment a 5 start was because of the service. I'm sorry but service is horrible! Our server was rude the way the food was presented at the table was not acceptable.  Being from Vegas and being a foodie I was saddened by the service we got but I will give it another chance.  I love the decor and the live music...something we don't get anymore in Vegas: ( . Hopefully the management reads this and does some type of training with their staff on customer service."}
{"text":"The lasagna was not to good n meatballs where hard.  Gonna try the pizza next time. .."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but apparently the ownership has recently changed and now the food SUCKS!!!!"}
{"text":"Being from the Bronx the pizza was not good at all and the size for a large is rediculous  won't go back sorry rather got to Montazano on eastern blows them out the water!"}
{"text":"Tried it twice and won't give it a third try. Not impressed. Waiter was slow and not personable at all. Pizza was good but I can go many other places for that. Spaghetti tasted like raw tomato paste.  Not much flavor in any pasta dish.  Prices too high for the quality. Really wanted to like it but just don't."}
{"text":"My wife and I made a trial run at Gabriella's  a month or so ago. We found the food absolutely  wonderful. And the service provided by  Manolo to be absolutely first class.  Our trial run was to check the place out for a neighborhood party of 14 the following week. After our first visit we were sure our friends would love the place too. We were right; everybody in our party gave rave reviews, both about the food and about our waiter, Manolo . We have been back once again and will plan on making Gabriella's a regular restaurant for us  VegasPier"}
{"text":"Not impressed....salad was just vinegar and oil and was not cold.  Everything was rather tasteless.  The garlic bread came with a pure balsamic vinegar...no oil.....very odd.   had the toasted ravioli....no taste.  Although my husband had the sausage and peppers Classico and he enjoyed it.  I really wanted the veal parmigiana but not for $29!!!  Our waiter Kyle was really great.  I doubt we will return.  There are other better Italian restaurants in the area.  Thank heavens I had a Groupon."}
{"text":"I am very picky when trying new Italian restaurants. I always order meatballs or lasagna. I had the calzone with meatball, sausage and mushrooms. First (you can see in my picture) it's HUGE made to share. But he sauce not too salty, the bread and dipping sauce AMAZING, salad was simple with a very nice house dressing. I would highly recommend this place.  One last thing our waiter Manolo is THE MAN. Very nice a prompt with everything."}
{"text":"It sucks that my first review had to be bad, but this deserves a review. I went in with my boyfriend and we thought we were on a prank TV show, employees were arguing out loud In front of customers, we waited 50 minutes to get our one large pizza because we were given the wrong order twice. We had high suspicions that the man at the front counter was high or drunk because he took our order and later approached us asking if we had been helped, We thought he was joking but he was very serious, he was slurring his words and wasn't making much sense. Also the food wasn't what we expected especially after an hour wait. On the plus side, the restaurant was really nice and the bartender and one of the cooks were the ones who came out, helped us and apologized for what had happened."}
{"text":"What's this crap \"price varies\" on all their entrees. This tells me their prices must be high. Just state from $12 to $18. Turns me away from this place. Sorry."}
{"text":"Food is delicious! Huge portions so be prepared to bring home a to go box or split a plate. The salad was good, maybe a little over dressed. Garlic bread was good. Our meals were perfect.  The service was fast and friendly. I liked the simple decor. Very old school italian restaurant.  Loved the piano player. He provided great music for the atmosphere.  We will return here for sure and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"family and I went there last night and had a wonderful time.    Ambience was great. The inside is much bigger then the outside leads you to believe. they even had an upstairs balcony area for large parties. They had a clear glass partition into the kitchen area and a projector screen playing the movie \"Guys and Dolls\" from the 50's. it was really cool.  Service was outstanding. the gentleman helped my family perfectly. There was a note on the menu that said no substitutions and no changes. I was worried since I am allergic to cheeses. the waiter laughed and just said the owner puts it in the menu to avoid outrageous requests and to hold the integrity of the dishes.  I got the chicken and artichoke, family got pastas. everything was perfect. nothing else to say.  The bill came out to $95 thats 4 adult plates, 2 canolis, and 4 non alcoholic beverages.  this will definitely be on our regular list of restaurants. I guess the chef is from LAVO and was rated the 3rd best in Las Vegas at one time.."}
{"text":"Great food!! Amazing atmosphere !!! And best of all fantastic service. Ask for Kyle he is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I'm laughing at everyone else's reviews because it makes me think of the two women sitting at the booth beside me as I type this review. Don't be a prick to the serves because they're people too. I watched the black server deal with these rude women throughout the duration of my dinner and he handled it very well. These women brought in their own bottle of wine and asked for a bucket to chill it in. Their server accommodated these women very politely, including wine glasses. The servers are such kind people, persistently following up on the quality of service. I think this place deserves 5 stars. Super cute little Italian place and great service. It's no Italy, but for a picky person like me, it's no Olive Garden either so I suggest people watch the Yelp! episode on South Park"}
{"text":"So flippin good!   To start the bar tender recommended the house sangria, fruity and really good. My boyfriend and I weren't super hungry so we got appetizers and dessert. You must try the calamari and zucchini fritters.  For dessert we shared the cannoli, YUMMMM! Defiantly recommend."}
{"text":"Hated it. Was so close to taking back the food and throw it at them. I was that upset. Waste of $100.. Placing the order amd receiving part was a nice experience. We were really hungry and reading all the great yelp reviews of this place got us REALLY excited. Now the food.... I could've gotten better food.out of a can than this.  The minestrone was just awful. It tasted like they used pre-packaged powder seasoning of some sort with absolutely no flavor from the vegetables. Calamari was so chewy like rubber that we had to chew like 1000 times. The pizza? Oh my... we ordered the sonny which is their version of a supreme or a combination I think. The sauce was horrible.. it actually made me spit it back out. We also ordered their $20 \"specialty\" pasta. All we tasted was alcohol. Either they were trying to cover up something fishy or just really love using EXTRA vodka in their sauce. The house salad that came with the meals, ughh.. how do u mess up on salads??? Also ordered a slice of cheesecake which was waaay too sweet. Although they were nice enough to give us two free cannolis, they were also just bad.  Only reason we tried this place was because we were feeling lazy to go pick up at grimaldi's which is our usual spot and they don't deliver.  Am I ever going to try this place out again? NO. NEVER. Plus, this place is way over priced. Ughh gross..."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for over a year and suddenly the food has changed.  Our servicer was great, but the food wasn't.   We were told they are under new management and new chef.   If anyone knows where the original owners and chef are please let me know!  We will try it one more time."}
{"text":"Best spot off the strip!! I love Gabriella's!! We've been twice since they opened and I'm excited to bring our friends to our new spot! This place is fantastic and the service is AMAZING!! I've lived in Vegas for over a year and I have NOT received service like I have here!! The first time I came here I was wearing yoga pants and an oversized top bc I just off a long flight... The staff treated me like a QUEEN despite me looking disheveled.   Memo, Wesley, Elias, and Kevin all fantastic! I'm planning a becoming a regular customer bc I love this atmosphere, the staff and the food is a AMAZING!!!   The Soprano pizza and Calamari is great!! Plus the wine selection is awesome and really good prices. I love that the staff knows how to properly serve wine and their knowledge of the menu and beverages selection."}
{"text":"After coming to Gaby's on a pretty regular basis since it opened a few months ago I've decided to give it 5 stars and let fellow Yelpers know about it. I hope many of you will stop in since I really want this place to make it. The food is so good. Had the pomodoro tonight. Delicious. Like grandma would have made, if I were Italian! Ce with a big salad and garlic bread. Great ambience. Super employees. Wonderful everyday happy hour from 4-7 in bar. Really good draft beer selection. All crafts, no crap. Wine list needs some more choices in my view, but they have several very drinkable reds and whites by the glass for just $5. $4 during happy hour. Overall I'm thrilled to have Gabriella's in my neighborhood. And I will be back, often."}
{"text":"hate to do this but carmines is back open. horizon and carnagie. last time we ate here was without liam and not the same. was charged 9.50 for a wells banana bread beer? really? bartender just said \"dont kill the messenger\"  carmines pizza is still the best in henderson"}
{"text":"I really like the live music. So many of us musicians ended up leaving full time music in the late 80's when the Union struck and canned music replaced trained musicians in the show rooms, it gives me great pleasure to see live music in the Restraunt as well as the patio. Last time we had the calamari. It was decent enough, but tonight we had fried mozzarella. I preferred the mozzarella to the calamari. Also had Caesar salad and regular house salad. I really enjoyed the Caesar. The house dressing, on the other was very light.   This time, instead of pizza, we went with the chicken parm and the ravioli. The chicken parm was good. The ravioli tasted like it had not been cooked long enough. It was a bit doughy. Now, full disclosure. They were serving a party of 12 and we did wait a while to be served. We really did not mind that much, because we enjoyed the music, the down time and Heather, our server was so pleasant. The manager was apologetic, so I want to believe that, in the interest of getting food orders out, the raviolis might have come out too soon.  May not be great, if you have to wait on a large party, however, when you have a couple hours to kill before a movie, it is nice. I will probably give them at least one more try."}
{"text":"What a treat to come here for Valentines Day. It was crazy busy! But it was Valentines Day, so no matter where you go, it was going to be busy. Gilbert was an amazing waiter despite the craziness!  We had the Italian Nacho's to start. Those were AMAZING! I had the Mahi Mahi. Fantastic! The Mahi was grilled perfectly and the Parmesan risotto was wonderful. My husband had the roma pasta with grilled chicken. He loved it. To finish the meal, I had the cheesecake. By far, the BEST cheesecake that I have ever had and my husband had the pistachio gelato.   I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"It is nice to have a new Italian restaurant in the area. This place recently opened and it seems like they haven't quite worked out all of the kinks. Our waiter was very nice but not very knowledgeable. Our chicken entrees were just ok. I found the Chicken Piccatta almost too salty to finish. The garlic bread was excellent and the spumoni gelato was also excellent. We will try this place again for their pizza."}
{"text":"Came here the other night for family dinner and was very impressed! The place is a little small so maybe that's where these other reviews are coming from... But I thought they had excellent customer service. Our server who I can't remember her name was friendly and knowledgeable, the manager even came around and welcomed us. The food does take a little longer to come out because it is made fresh, so grab an appetizer and a beer and enjoy the lovely man serenading the restaurant!   MUST TRY THE NACHOS! You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Manny was very attentive and helpful. The food was amazing and the service was fantastic!! I'll definitely be back! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced. We spent $18.00 on a calzone and there was little to no cheese in it. Ridiculous. It has fine dining prices but the food is marginal at best. Go to Carmine's little Italy for a MUCH better calzone for half the price. a HUGE disappointment.  Will never go back"}
{"text":"My wife had the chicken parm and I had the Milano. Both dishes were fantastic and portions decent as well. Tried a cheese pizza also; very cheesy and flavorful as far as the cheese, but overall it lacked enough sauce for my taste. Hence 4 stars not five. Great wait staff."}
{"text":"They have a crazy good happy hour from 4-7 with 2.50 CRAFT beers!  And various live music on the weekends,  the menu is huge so there is something for everyone.  Everything is made fresh from the sausage to the desserts,  try the tiramisu. It's insanely good.  Plus it's kind of cool to be able to see the hustle and bustle through the kitchen window.  Or they show old movies on the projection screen too. It's very charming."}
{"text":"Wow !!!  Awesome time at Gabriella's. Great food with great draft beer and wine list.  The service was great.  Usually when a place just opens you will get little hiccups in the service as they work through the kinks, but not here. Excellent job here tonight. Live music was a nice touch too."}
{"text":"We tried the Mediterranean pizza, it was delicious! Very nice ingredients, plus a very quick delivery (20 minutes). One pizza was big enough for the two of us (we were very hungry!). The garlic bread that comes with was tasty, but small portions and the salad that also came with it was very fresh, but not anything super creative (romaine, diced tomato, two chunks of likely muenster cheese, and one pepperoncini). Over all, very nice, especially for 18 bucks for the two of us."}
{"text":"Family favorite. Great Italian food and atmosphere. Love the music. Try the tomato soup and the zucchini!!! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Very nice and attentive staff, like amazingly nice, and really fun inviting decor, which is why they get three stars.  The food however is fairly bland and uneventful. Overly vinigered house salad, bread on the table that is a bit tough and tastes like they use margarine instead of real butter on it.  The eggplant parmesan had a good texture to it, but the tomato sauce base is lacking dimension.  My boyfriends food almost tasted like when someone uses a nonstick pan to cook without throwing through the dishwasher first.  They took it off the bill and were very apologetic, and even  made him another dish on the house to take home. The prices are very high for how basic this food is.  I could go to circo at bellagio pay maybe a couple dollars more for a mind blowing pasta dish.  I have had real Italian food, that makes you feel comforted and your soul sing. This is not it."}
{"text":"Service was great. The food is made fresh daily and you could tell. We had the mozzarella sticks super yummy, pizza great crust and it comes with 2 side salads, meatball sandwich - bread was good but the meatballs were small and ok and it came with truffle garlic fries, kids spaghetti and meatball great, and portobello mushrooms could have passed on. I would give it 4 stars except for its price. The entire order came to $73 before tip. I like to try to keep our meals around $60 for this type of dining.  The offer a free scoop of Gellato with movie ticket is a bonus."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, lovely decor, great wait staff, live piano music, outdoor seating and yummy gelato...what more can you ask for...recommend the lasagna and shrimp scampi...next time will try sausage & peppers...terrific sauce..."}
{"text":"We had the chicken Alfredo, ravioli, cheese & pepperoni pizza and the mozzarella cheese appetizer. Each meal came with a salad and bread sticks. The portions are generous. Everything we had was delicious. The mozzarella sticks were big and yummy!! Entertainment for tonight was a nice man singing good old fashion music. Service was good, however, I never got the wine list I requested."}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic, though pricey. I am sad to see that this place has closed their doors."}
{"text":"Disappointed due to the fact that they won't accommodate you to exchange their hose salad for a soup. Just got the green salad even if I don't eat it. Will never come back to this place."}
{"text":"This is a place we will certainly visit many times over.  Where do I start?  We were in the mood for pizza and thought we would try our neighborhood Pizzeria.  Kyle, our waiter was terrific.  I mentioned that the salad looked a kind of plain.  He told me it was meant to be light and flavorful and they offer free refills. Hmmm.  He was right!  The salad was really good.  I did order the free refill. Did I forget to mention that excellent garlic bread that came with the salad?  One word, DELICIOUS!  Kyle also suggested a really nice beer to compliment the Sicilian pizza my husband had order. His suggestion was right on the money.  Excellent choice.  I ordered the Chicken Piccata.  I am here to tell you.  It was the best I've ever had.  This place makes everything from fresh, nothing from a can. I tried the pizza.  It was out of this world!!  We are foodies and this place hits a home run.  Once people find out about this place, it's going to a reservations place only.  Shhh! just take your best friends and family here.  Don't blab it all over the place.  I like the atmosphere and don't want to see it turn into a loud and crowded restaurant ."}
{"text":"This place SUCKS! All of our food was very bland, my dad ordered the spaghetti and sausage and the sausage was OLD , my $25 shrimp scampi was nothing excited, I could have made it better and made it look more nice at home. Seriously do not go here . They asked what kind of dressing we wanted with our salads come to find out its $4.00 a salad!!!  There was 5 of us and our bill was $130.00 WAY over priced for terrible quality and small portions. Don't waste your time ."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with the family and family friend. Started with the calamari and marinara sauce and the portobello mushrooms with dill dipping sauce both were great. I had a Brooklyn lager to go with my dinner. The salad comes with the pizza and you can order the house salad or upgrade to the Caesar salad for a little extra. Both were great. They serve the pepperonis, olives, and Munster cheese on the side. The garlic bread comes with olive oil with a lot of herbs mixed in. The pizzas are large enough to serve 2-3 people, we tried the clams casino, saprano, and Roma pizza. I also ordered the clams and linguini, which came with what seemed to be half clams in the shell and half liguini which is a good thing. The bread is delicious to dip in the sauce. My son had the artichoke chicken that comes with angel hair pasta, which he liked. We were so stuffed but we managed to try the Nutella cake. We had boxed up the remaining pizza for leftovers. The staff is friendly and accommodating. My 4 year old spilled his milk under the table and they cleared it right up and replaced it. The staff were quick to clear plates as we moved through the appetizers and salads. A definite upgrade from the previous pizza place this used to be, and a definite great alternative and step up from macaroni grill and Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Very good service, our server Justin was attentive and polite. The spaghetti was bland, the meatballs seasoned well and tasty. Salad good, bread sticks stingy and a bit stale. Drinks expensive $9 for alcohol, $3.75 for Diet Coke. What got to us was the charge for asking for a bit more sauce for the spaghetti. Who does that?"}
{"text":"I had high hopes of this place because of the fun decor....but the service was awful and the food was so disappointing. We ordered a margherita pizza and added chicken to it...the \"chicken\" that was on it had to have been canned chicken at best. I tried picking it off & felt a piece I was taking off feel jiggly/rubbery (typically doesn't happen with cooked normal chicken). At this point - I raised the white flag. The garlic bread was good though. That is all."}
{"text":"Being an Italian born and raised in Brooklyn, I always get excited when a new Italian restaurant opens near my home.   Walking in I was really impressed.  It has a nice quaint feel with checker tablecloths, wooden booths and cute rustic decor.   Our waiter was friendly but I thought his fake Italian accident was a little much and weird.  Whatever.  Lol  We started with the calamari and was surprised on how tender it was.  The marinara dipping sauce had the right kick of flavor.  Good calamari is always hard to find out here, so I was excited for the rest of my meal after tasting theirs. I ordered the chicken artichoke, my husband the eggplant parm and my daughter spaghetti with butter and side meatball.   Our salad came out first and it was way below expectations.  Wet iceberg lettuce with a 1/8 of a chopped tomato.  I could not tell if there was dressing on the salad or if it was wet from the rinsed lettuce. While out appetizer and salad came out in an appropriate timeframe, our food took forever which when you are a restaurant that is kid friendly, is i expectable.  When our food finally came out,  they brought mine and my husbands but stated that my daughters would take longer.  It was noodles with butter-  what was the issue?  Her food came out in an unreasonable amount of time after.   My daughter loved the meatball but didn't touch the spaghetti.  She didn't care for it.  She said it was wet and mushy.   My husbands eggplant was very flavorful but the slices were cut a little too thick for my liking and it was a little salty for our taste.   My artichoke chicken was less then par.  The pasta was mushy-  way over cooked and the chicken had way too much going on.  Nothing blended together in the way you would expect them too.  We asked for more bread, on two super are occasions (which was delic) because my daughter was still hungry but they failed to bring it.  When we got the bill I was shocked to see they didn't include a kids soda with the kids meal.  Her meal (which she didn't eat) was $8 and $3.50 for a soda.   While I do have high expectations for Italian food, this place failed on all levels in my book.  We will not be back.  Save the time, the calories and the money.  There are better places in town."}
{"text":"How could I not love a place that shares my name! My new favorite spot just down the street from out house. I've tried several dishes and everything is delicious. They have a daily happy hour from 4p-7p. $2.50 draft beers, $4 gasses of wine, and $7.95 bar food!"}
{"text":"The decor and the live music was average. For some reason though, I didnt feel any warmth or welcoming enthusiasm from the servers. They all look so sad and gloomy. The whole experience was weird. The food was okay. Nothing that wowed me particularly. Used a Groupon and redemption was easy. Not coming back though."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere! Delicious food!  The calamari was great and everyone loved there meals.  Kids ate everything and wanted to know when we were coming back.  The piano player added a very classy touch and played to the kids with songs from Frozen mixed in with the standards.   Definitely adding to our regular haunts."}
{"text":"Best pizza to date in Vegas. The Sicilian was unreal! Came with salad for 2 and slices of garlic bread for $18!!!! Are you kidding me?!?!?  Sara L that rated it a 1, pull the stick out and go back to Olive Garden where you belong."}
{"text":"Food is good. Staff is friendly. Took us a few attempts to see if they could get it together though. We like having a nice Italian restaurant around the corner. However, still a little overpriced..."}
{"text":"STAY FAR, FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. I was totally stoked when I read the reviews on yelp prior to going. We went for my husbands 40th birthday. I asked the hostess on the down low if they could do anything for him like sign or cake. She totally miss understood the question and started talking about how they host large parities and cater...total blond. She finally got what I was talking about but it was too late my husband had heard the whole conversation. Surprise blown :(  Let's move on to the waiter...nice guy, asked if we wanted drinks. Now on yelp I had ready that they have 80 selections of beer...AWESOME...no, not really. I asked for Mich Ultra and he said they did not have that. I asked for Hein Light, no they don't have that. I said, \"What kind of light beer do you have?\". He said, \"we only have Corona Light. Okay, I can live with that. So what does he bring me...a Coor's Light. WTH?? I feel the waiter was not educated on the beer/wine selections.   So we order apps, Calamari & Brochette. Calamari was good but the brochette was nothing but tomatoes and cheese. Not basil, no flavor, nothing. The baggets were burnt to a crisp, so I would not recommend getting that. The family style salad that you get with you entrees in a JOKE!! The size is small, (there were three of us total) and it was noting but lettuce and tomatoes drizzled in olive oil. Would not recommend this at all either.  Entrees were good, I ordered the Chicken w/ artichokes but thought it was a little pricy for the two small breast they give you, plus they ask you to not alter the dishes in anyway, so I couldn't substitute veggies for pasta.   While eating dinner the sun began blaring in our eyes and the waiter jokenly said, \"I hate this time of day.\" Din't offer to draw the blinds down, nothing. We must have sat with the sun in our eyes for a couple of minutes before I finally got up and asked the hostess to place close them; she reluctantly did it.   Overall this was a bad experience from the hostess, to the server and to the food. I know my family and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Wonderful outdoor patio with a very talented guitarist and vocalist performing.  You could think that your on the streets in Europe.  The food is delicious servers are very knowledgeable of how entrees are prepared.  Nice craft beer selection!  Please support this new restaurant in our neighborhood so they can stay around!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but now that I have experienced it, I will not return.   I kept seeing this restaurant on Facebook and looking at their page, it seems to be a wonderful family owned business with delicious food, so I really wanted to check it out. I finally got a sitter and confirmed that they would be open for lunch on Saturday. We got there at 11:15 am, and no one was there. The girl working at the shop next door said they would open soon, so we decided to wait around. After 30 minutes, we decided to go somewhere else. I was disappointed that after confirming opening time the day before, we still wasted a trip and time. When I expressed my disappointment to the restaurant in a message, there was no reply.  Well, I keep seeing these pictures and posts on Facebook, so I thought we'd give it another try. Arrived at 5:15 on a Monday night. The hostess just gave us a blank stare and finally after a couple of minutes, welcomed us and took us to our booth. She seemed confused the whole night...not really sure what her mind was on, but it certainly wasn't her job. She was really just acting strange. After we were seated, there was no server for a while and the hostess came back over and fumbled around with the chef special, menus, etc. Our server finally took our drink order. There was only 1 other table of guests, by the way, so definitely not busy. 10 minutes later our server came out and took our order. He was great and even offered to bring out the kid's meal with the appetizer. Those came out in about 15 minutes, delicious and hot. Then we sat for 30 minutes. Finally the server came back out with garlic bread and salad (aka romaine with dressing and 4 pieces of diced tomato...do not pay the extra $4 for this!). At that point, a new server took over our server's shift. (The new server was not friendly, and it was obvious he didn't want to be there). At 6:30 (1hr15min after arrival), the hostess came to our table and said, \"Do you need boxes, or what's going on here?\" Wow. rude. I responded with, \"We haven't even gotten our main course yet.\" She said, \"Oh yeah, I saw your food sitting in there, I'll get it.\" 8 minutes later, the server comes out and mumbles something about the chef didn't think the food looked right, so he made it again. Seemed like a cover story, especially since my food was lukewarm. At that point we just asked him to box up our mediocre food and bring the check. We were finally out of there at 6:50. To make matters worse, the restroom needed attention. One faucet was totally broken off and laying in the sink. The other sink had vomit in it. The paper towels were all jammed.   The few pros were our 1st server, large kids' portions, good pizza and fried mozz, and the ambiance. I only wish we could have seen the game, but the only TV was by the bar, and since we had children along, we sat in the regular dining area. Unfortunately, this isn't enough to make me ever want to come back. We will definitely stick with Bravo! at the Galleria."}
{"text":"Just to be clear as I start this review, we have never actually gone to Gabriella's for a \"meal\"...we go for happy hour. My wife and I discovered Voo Doo Stout (as recomended by our bartender Liam who is very knowledgeable about the beer menu and the food menu as well as being the provider of excellent service every time we have been). We get the Italian Stallion sandwhich off the happy hour menu which is the best sandwhich currently known to man; Italian meats and cheese on a great roll all hot and melty. The truffle fries are a perfect compliment.  A couple beers each, a sandwhich each for around $30.00, ridiculously great deal. We always sit at the bar and get great service everytime."}
{"text":"(Actual score: 2.5/5) Food was okay at best, either hit or miss. While I certainly liked the Italian nachos and the garlic bread, I didn't like the chicken parmesan. I thought the spaghetti wasn't that appetizing, and the chicken was a bit overcooked and dry.  The only reason why this review doesn't have a higher score is because of the plate-sharing fee. It's not because of the cost of the fee - it was $4 if you wanted to share your plate with someone. I was with a group of friends, and the waiter decided not to tell us about the fee until after we were done with our food. It would be completely understandable except for the fact that the waiter was standing right in front of us when we verbally decided to share food at the beginning of our time there. Future warning for those who come here with more than one other person."}
{"text":"Visited Gabriella's for third time tonight. Chicken Parmesan was delicious.. red sauce not too sweet. Two huge chicken breasts cooked to perfection. Gilbert provided excellent service. When he was attending to other diners, waiters stepped in to fill glasses and bread basket (which is also superb!)"}
{"text":"We have seen this going to and from our shopping days and decided to stop in and try it. It sits next to a Cuban restaurant we are quite fond of. As we arrived we were greeted immediately in a booth toward the back. Our waiter was prompt to come and get our drink order. Okay, so here is my first issue, in the front of restaurant is a sign that says craft drafts happy hour $2.50. I requested one of the happy hour drafts and was told that was in the bar only. That was not stated on the sign. So I opted out of the beer, not because I am cheap or they were expensive but it does not make sense that that deal not extended 10 feet into restaurant. I would have had 2 beers with dinner a loss for them of $5.00 I ordered a diet coke with unlimited refills. I did ask waiter if I could walk to the bar order a beer and bring it to my table and he said he was unaware of that.   Food. We ordered Chicken Alfredo for me and Josie had the Clams in white wine sauce. Meal comes with a salad and bread sticks. Bread sticks are average for an Italian restaurant. The salad was standard oil and vinegar. It tasted a bit salty and very oily. It needed, for me, grated Parmesan. Gilbert our waiter did not ask if we desired a grated cheese for our salad. The waitress serving the table behind us asked immediately of the guests at her table if cheese was desired for salad. Maybe it is supposed to be asked or she is just more thoughtful that way.   We have discovered that we are spoiled by Pasta Mia our favorite Italian place. Josie's clams were very garlic filed and also had onions. Not sure about recipes for white wine sauces and the inclusion of onions. Other than that it was good. My chicken Alfredo was tasty and contained copious amounts of chicken. It was cheesy and filling. One negative, it did seem a little over salted for my taste. I would like to go back however I hope if they offer a happy hour it transfers to restaurant as well. If in area stop give it a try."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant based solely on the reviews I read here. I was very hesitant because there where a lot of warnings to stay away but I live around the corner and I want small businesses to succeed! Unfortunately, It just wasn't good. The entire process was wrong! Food listed for one price was another, our waitress was horrible...talk about upselling, she kept trying to steer us to the most expensive for everything, we waited FORRREVVVVEEERRR for every item we ordered and forget about the check??? She took 20 minutes to get me back my card, and then told how she likes people to relax with her so she purposely stalls...her words, not mine! The food wasn't horrible but isn't good either! The tomato sauce is SO sweet on the pizza. The white sauce pies were off-putting and the salad dressing the give you with dinner was terrible. I wanted so much to like this place, the manager was so sweet and appeared to really care but unless something changes this place will be a statistic in 6 months!"}
{"text":"I am so IN LOVE with this place. Perfect environment for date night or chillin out with friends. Came here on a friday night, our server was amazing(Justin), demonstrated his knowledge of the menu items, ingredients and preparation, friendly, patient and offered recommendations. The decor was animated and thoughtful, seating was available for small or large groups. I loved that they had the movie Casa Blanca playing on a projector and a live solo singer singing the classics of  Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin- it was great!  Really brightened my experience. Take a moment to check out the history and take note that per our server, the ovens were transported  all the way from the motherland herself, Italy.   FOOD tips- all I can say is that everything on the menu looks delicious. Our meals were wonderful: CHICKEN SALTIMBOCCA AND LASANGA. They give you bread, but if you order a \"flight\" of wine, you get cheese and meats, and do not need to order appetizers. I high recommend ordering that as part of your meal. The menu is varied, so I feel like you have to try something new each time you visit. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT leave without tasting their desert, did I mention they have a GELATO stand at the entrance. I had the almond pistachio, not worth the $15 for a pint, but it was decent. Overall, great first experience. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"This place was REALLY good!  We went there with our family (4 kids) and it was a great night out.  Food was really fresh. Pizza was perfection.  Crust was seriously so good, it is on the thinner side so you won't feel heavy afterwards.  Pizza was less than $20 and came with salad and bread for the table.  You can't beat that.  The atmosphere is so comfortable with live music. Service was top notch.   We will probably eat here a few times a month.  As far as pizza goes, this is a favorite!"}
{"text":"We were happy they instituted a lunch menu at 11:00 a.m. daily recently.  I ordered the Siciliana personal pizza, 12 inches, which was crispy and flavorful with prosciutto, sausage, salami, and fresh mozzarella in tomato sauce (minimal) with herbs. Delicioso! My wife had the Chicken Parmigiana, pounded out breast with mozzarella, parmigiana, and a lovely tomato sauce on a panini sandwich roll. Excellent. The pre-meal bread and balsamic/garlic dip was just okay. That's why the 4. Our server, Dawn, was personable, engaging and checked in with us at various points to make sure we had everything we needed. We'll be back to sample the dinner fare.  This was good, and is head and shoulders above the Don Antonio's that left our neighborhood a while ago."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've had at an Italian restaurant here in Vegas. The service was terrible and the food was below average. We got chicken on one of our pizzas and it looked/tasted like it came from a can. My fiancé had one slice then had to stop eating. The one good thing I can say is the happy hour is decent. $2.75 for a beer is a good deal. Other than that, this place is useless and I do not plan on a return"}
{"text":"Gabriella artichoke chicken very good auth. Italian food  i just expexted the chicken to b bigger.  Music is on point!!!  Flavor is immpecable!!!  Salad was lacking a lot for better words!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place tonight!  Memo was a wonderful and very attentive server! My friend and i ordered one solo pizza.  Memo brought us salad and garlic bread,  he split the salad for us, which was nice.  The pizza was pretty big and really good! He offered us dessert but we were just too full. Nice ambiance with outdoor seating!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had our wedding dinner for 14 guests here Thurs 11-13. I can't say enough about this place. Rick the owner went over everything with us before hand, and helped us plan a fabulous menu. The night of our event went over without a hitch. The food was amazing!! Our guests were blown away. Not many had heard about Gabriella's before, but all said they would definetly be back. The staff (Stanley and Liam) took awesome care of us, and the chef outdid himself. It was the perfect ending to our perfect day. This is the best Italian food you will have... Oh, and the Italian Nachos...to die for!!!! Thanks you guys."}
{"text":"So my Mom and I came in here to check this place out. I saw it because I get my hair done in the same plaza, then also received a coupon in mail. I looked up the menu online and it looked like it could be yummy.   Well it WAS for the most part yummy. Started off with a Caesar salad. I am pretty picky when it comes to caesars and this one I would say it was OK.  I'll try the house salad next time. The garlic bread was absolutely delicious. We had to ask for more. My mother got the Zuppa and the pepperoni flat bread. Both of which were great! I decided on the mahi Mahi with Parmesan risotto and asparagus. Unfortunately the fish was a bit dry. the risotto and asparagus were good though.   It was a cute place with a guy that sang and played piano so it was a nice atmosphere. I will definitely return and maybe even take a pizza to go. :-)"}
{"text":"Food was good just expected larger portions of my chicken not three little miget of pieces, flavorful was satisfied overall."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out after seeing it located right next to the Regal Cinemas where I saw a movie. Overall, I thought this place was just OK. Nothing fabulous, but not bad either, and I'd probably come back if I wanted a quick bite after the movies.  I got the \"Solo\" pizza for my meal. This is basically the \"build your own\" personal sized pizza. It comes with 3 toppings and was actually way bigger than I expected. I could only eat half and took the rest to go. I'm a big pizza gal and I thought this one was pretty good! They have an extensive selection of large pizzas that have pre-determined toppings and many of those sounded delicious. If someone else in my group would've wanted pizza I probably would have went for one of those options.  My meal came with a side salad and garlic bread. The bread was really good, but I found the salad dressing to be very \"vinegar-y.\""}
{"text":"Not impressed. First of all, it seemed as though the waiter didn't know what he was doing. He didn't say much. He didn't check on us after food was delivered, in which I was upset because we were a party of 9 and we weren't checked up on. Food was served seperatly and he failed to let us know the rest out be out shortly. Food was OK. I didn't care for the peppers in my spaghetti. Meatballs were OK. Not amazing. Not my idea of amazing Italian.  Overall, don't bother. I'm sure there's other better out here."}
{"text":"So I went there the other day with the family ..The ambience was amazing and we were seated right away.. We were greeted by a the friendliest sever  . He was very knowledgeable of the menu beers, and especially the variety of wines.He knew the plates from top to bottom    He offered us the special of  four small of wine and an antipasto platter .. it was totally amazing experience."}
{"text":"Delicious,  homemade food. Live music, you can't go wrong. Well worth the trip. We tried the lasagna and shrimp scampi. Would definitely order again, but look forward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a place where I can find real Italian pizza and this is one of them. Tastes like in Italy. Fresh baked! The people there are always super friendly and it is a very clean place. Stuff is super friendly and courteous! Love driving there through the pitman wash with the bike and eat there. Huge parking lot outside as well. Perfect location. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Started with the fried mozzarella, good and freshly made, not frozen like some places!Good pizza! Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Also tried their Zuppa soup in a bread bowl, that was really good as well (they make their own sausage!). For dessert we tried the cannolis, not the best I've had, but good. I say give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice, we ordered pizza with mushroom, sausage and extra cheese.  It was our first time there and it had been a long week so I was looking forward to relaxing and my male friend and I thought we would try out Gabriella since it was close to home.  Our server was not pleasant, he made us feel rushed, he was rude.  We ordered our pizza and it was Luke warm. Our server gave us our bill and kept coming back every three to five minutes checking to see if we put money inside for the bill.  He made us very uncomfortable and was sending a message loud and clear we were not welcomed as customers.  I will not return to that place and will tell my friends don't go.  I hate to complain everyone needs a job,  this   Server was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Well. : strikes and your out.   My 8 yr old loves singing with Moses the piano guy who is AWESOME.  Took 45 months minutes to get our salad and bread.  Over hour 20 for a kids shrimp, a pizza and meatball parm.  Place pretty empty so not sure why.    Waiter and manager don't have answers.  Bottom line come for a drink and listen to Moses on the piano otherwise 3 strikes your out.    Yes vid given them 3 chances"}
{"text":"Gabreilla's is closed. We will miss it a lot. The neighborhood lost a great place to eat and meet your friends. We will miss it."}
