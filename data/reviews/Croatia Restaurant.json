{"text":"The cevapi are absolutely great!  The rest of the food is just as good and the portions are generous.  This place looks to be great for small parties.  
The wines are not bad selection and reasonably priced.

Sometimes a bit difficult to find between the plazas, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing home made Croatian food.  
Soup is home made and like nothing you will find in the area. 
My favorite is the mixed meat platter and they have great seafood. Stipe the owner and his team do an amazing job.  

Try it and see."}
{"text":"I have been to Croatia Restaurant many times and the food has always been delicious! I love their schnitzel and cevapi! The mixed meat platter is a good option if you want to try a variety of meats (cevapi, schnitzel, meat skewers). They have friendly service and make you feel at home. They also have a nice selection of seafood. Their calamari is really good.

This is a good restaurant to try if you like Croatian and Eastern European food."}
{"text":"I agree with the below two reviewers about this place - solid traditional Croatian food, just like your Baka used to make. The meat platter is definitely the way to go here as it has a bit of everything and will leave you more than satisfied. The coleslaw is the traditional vinaigrette based European style and is always delicious. This place has a very homey feel to it and the service is usually above average. The calamari is also phenom! Definitely recommend this place, especially for those displaced Croatians who miss the food back home."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best Balkan food in Toronto. It's not particularly fancy or progressive but what they do, they do extremely well. All the traditional favourites are available, like cevapcici, raznicji and schnitzel. They also have quite an extensive seafood selection with both whole fish and filets, as well as excellent shellfish. The quality of the food is unmatched, and has a home-cooked character. The service is gracious and attentive, but definitely not formal. I highly recommend going with 4-6 people and exploring the meat and fish platters. This allows you to taste quite a range of dishes and make a true assessment. The servings are abundant and the prices are more than fair. I definitely try to visit for at least one family-event per year. This is the best Croatian food I've had outside of Croatia!"}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant with friendly staff. The calamari is the best I have had in the GTA. The mixed meat platter is AMAZING. a good variety of Croatian meats - very delicious. I highly recommend this place."}
