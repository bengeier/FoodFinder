{"text":"Went for breakfast with my family there. Even though it said after 11 they don't serve breakfast. The server still gave us the breakfast option... Super nice people, cute restaurant, amazing customer service...and the best is their apple cake they have it was the most delicious apple cake I have ever tried."}
{"text":"I went here for my first time this week on my birthday because of all the great reviews. 
The food was horrible. We ordered $100 worth of food between 4 of us and besides the queso fundido it was all no Bueno. 
The carne asada platter was old, dry and tough. Not to mention it was already cut up in strips for me. The tacos were the same tough meat. The beans tasted old and a slight burned flavor and the rice was bland. The mgr was making his rounds at the tables and when we asked to see him he skipped our table. This was our first and last time going there."}
{"text":"Came in from Dallas to Scottsdale and came across this amazing Mexican restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly and the food is amazing! We decided ordered a few appetizers, corn on the cob, shrimp asado and the oaxacan queso fundido! My son opted on the no que no burger which was nice and spicy of course I took a bite!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very good lunch. Large portions, served hot and very tasty. Waitress was friendly and helpful. I will go back."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely blown away how this restaurant has received so many 5 Stars.. Loco Patron is better than this place and that's saying a lot. My party of four each ordered something completely different off the menu and we all felt the same way. The staff was friendly, but the food wasn't worth it. 

Pros: Guac was amazing
Cons: To many 

If you're reading this, do yourself a favor and drive a few miles down the road and get Diego Pops.."}
{"text":"I grew up in the area and have never really paid too much attention to this shopping plaza, or any businesses in it. When I was out running some errands I saw a gentlemen holding a sign with No Que No, normally wouldn't think twice about it and go about my day. I get home and the wifey and I wanted to go grab a bite to eat, after several minutes of playing \"what do you want to eat, what are you craving\"she said Mexican. I remembered that sign from earlier, checked the all ever so important Yelp review, got the 4 kiddos ready and we were on our way. We get there and was surprised how much bigger inside than it appears from outside. Immediately greeted when we walked in, sat us right away and took our drink orders (waters). Great in expensive kid menu ($5) , our littles had a bean and cheese burrito and the other street tacos. They finished them! The bigger kiddos had the elote and a burger, also finished them. The wifey ordered a burrito and a side of rice and said it was really good. I'm vegan, I had the veggie burrito, since the rice and beans that come in the burrito were not vegan the waitress brought it out as a side dish for the wifey at no additional charge, I'm instead of the side if rice she ordered and would of had to pay for. This burrito had really good flavor, just wasnt spicy enough for me (nothing ever is). I asked the waitress if I could have a roasted jalapeno, she brought it right out, I put it on my burrito... Perfect! The staff was extremely attentive, never an empty glass, quick to remove finished dishes out of our way. Great service and food. Only wish I would have noticed this place 2 years ago when they opened, this will now be our go to Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Muey bueno! My wife had the chicken fajitas and loved them. I had the mole chicken. The family comes from southern Mexico and they brought the mole recipe up with them. Authentic southern Mexican food. Not texmex. The only downside is that the portions are so large we didn't have room to try desert. At least we have lunch covered for tomorrow.  You can't go wrong here! Enjoy..."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and it's all homemade!! The mole was made to perfection, not a single item was missed. The tomatillo salsa is authentic and with just the right amount of heat. I could not have asked for a better Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have to be more carful about Yelp when people post this many stars.. Really hated the location, sorry but only for this can't be a almost five star they really tricked me.., food was only ok, edible at the point that I will never come back.. 
our waitress seemed like a nice person but doesn't mean she knew about nice costumer service and over that when We left (we were the only one in the restaurant) I had to scream bye to all of them, surprise because we always leave a very good tip (we are from the East coast and I grow up in the restaurant business)"}
{"text":"I should've known when I walked in that my experience wasn't going to be the best. It has the atmosphere of a Chinese restaurant but with Mexican music playing. We got store bought semi staled chips and watered down green salsa. We ordered the carne asada taco plate, which took forever to get and definitely not worth the wait. It was very dry and didn't have much flavor. At $12 a meal, I'd rather go to Taco Bell. The servers were very nice, but the food was not good. I'm disappointed that Yelp steered me the wrong way on this one :-("}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice now- both times were very good. The food and drinks were nothing out of the ordinary for a casual Mexican restaurant, but the people are very friendly and they have good specials. That's enough to keep us coming back!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good food and great happy hour specials! Love the carnitas plate and a cochita pibil plate (sp??). They are family friendly so I always feel comfortable with our 2 little ones here...and the $3 margaritas don't hurt either!"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from a local and loved the Saturday live mariachis with drink specials. Authentic mex food."}
{"text":"Super friendly fast service and great Morelos regional style cuisine.  Large portions are the standard for the food.  They also have the best Margarita menus I have ever seen.  When it comes to margaritas they don't scrimp on the taqueria so be sure have a designated driver because you will need them to drive you home!"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical with all the high reviews, but this place deserves it. Not sure when all these people go cause every time I go there is only a couple people there. One thing I think people might complain about is that the servings are not huge. Might want to order an appetizer if you are super hungry on top of your meal. I think it was the perfect meal size though and they do quality over quantity. Also the salsa isn't very spicy, but still very good. But the freshness and excellent taste of the food makes up for everything. Plus an excellent happy hour with a really good $3 margarita!"}
{"text":"SO yummy! We came here for breakfast and to say it was good is an understatement. The food was very, very fresh and it was clearly made from scratch. We will definitely be back to try out the cocktails and dinner options. Worth noting- they modified a dish to make it vegetarian for us...and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food and drink.  The signature Rita is outstanding.  Little pricey ($15) but worth it. We had the mole enchiladas and it was a good choice. Coming from the Midwest we had to try the shrimp and fried cactus for an appetizer. The shrimp was outstanding. The fried cactus was good but it's cactus.  The server was friendly and the food came out fast  If in town again I'd come back. We bought the Yelp discount coupon and saved $10."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Mexican Food Restaurant for a long time.  This was great.  Loved the salsa and the chicken enchiladas."}
{"text":"Awesome new family owned restaurant with fantastic Mexican food and breakfast.  And the staff is all wonderful!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here and the food and service are just as good as the first time! I hate to 'Yelp' and let others know of this gem but it really is my new 'go-to' place for Mexican food. The margaritas are good both in size and taste. The chips (nice and thin) and salsa (green) are also very good (and that is my scale -would like the salsa to be a little thicker (thus getting the fifth star)but all the flavor is there. The steak fajitas were good and perfect size to share with my hubby. We both highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! I had the mole enchiladas and they were delicious! Service was so friendly! What a great addition to the south Scottsdale neighborhood! We'!! Definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had a delicious breakfast here, I'm coming back for sure. Awesome music, the food is great. We had huevos rancheros and eggs, bacon, home fries, and toast. The huevos rancheros was beautiful and delicious, everything was perfectly cooked. I have a hard time getting eggs over medium, but this place got it right. Good margaritas, great coffee. Live Mariachi music Friday nights. Love it."}
{"text":"Do not eat here.  We have always trusted YELP, yet we cannot understand how this restaurant got over 1 Star.  We'd give it 1 Star for the Margarita, chips and green salsa but that's it.  The food was actually inedible- probably the worst Mexican food we've ever eaten.  It was embarrassing because the lady who served us was very nice and we just didn't have it in us to complain about all three dishes.  My husband is what you might call an aficionado on Carne Asada which is why we decided to try the high reviews for this dish here.  I ordered the shrimp burro, and our adult daughter ordered an egg dish.  There was something seriously wrong with the Carne Asada since there was a good chance we weren't even eating beef.  The flavor and texture was totally new to us, and not in a good way.  And the same went for my shrimp, although I was pretty certain that it was shrimp I was eating they tasted like old shrimp dredged from the bottom of a dirty, stagnant river...rendering it inedible.  Even the basics of good, staple Mexican food such as beans and rice were also terrible.  The retried beans had zero flavor and were very dry.  The rice, on the other hand, would have been better if it possessed the same bland taste; but unfortunately it held a strong, nasty flavor of mushed, mixed vegetables that don't have any place in Mexican rice.  And we're not talking about 'culinary carte blanc', or a chef back there being super creative.  Oh and how can I forget the red salsa that we asked for with the chips on the table.  A small basket of chips arrives with some green salsa (surprisingly good), but when we asked for the red salsa (which the server explained that they didn't have any, and should have been our first clue to get up and leave), she then brought out what tasted like a horrible mole; although she said it wasn't Mole.  Whatever it was wasn't to be consumed by humans or animals.  Look, we love good, classic Mexican fare which isn't that difficult when much of Mexican cooking uses the same ingredients: Fresh Jalapeños, Serrano chilis, in season fresh Cilantro, diced onions, limes, rice, pinto beans, bacon fat, pork, rice, etc...you get the picture.  So how this restaurant is still open is beyond me.  Maybe it's just their good Margaritas?  Maybe their own family and friends added the high ratings on Yelp?  Maybe the cook was out the day we ate there?  No matter the reason we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great location, great atmosphere. The food was excellent and the service was perfect. I definitely will be back and it's a must go place when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly service.

The cochinita pibil caught my eye so I ordered that.  The pickled red onions were amazingly sour and tasty.  The shredded pork was incredibly well-marinated and very fatty.  Super tender and juicy.

Horchata was tasty and there were free refills.  

Bathroom is clean, though the stall door is broken.  I had to pop the door inward so it wouldn't open.  Awkward."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience!  I called in my order ahead of time, which they had not made as I arrived to pick up my order.  We had to wait at least 10 minutes and then they skimped out on the order.  I did not check it, as I left, as I needed to leave, but found as I was on my way home, that I did not receive half of my order!  I called and asked about some of my order and was told that, yes, tortillas do come with fajitas!  I arrived back at the restaurant and asked the accompaniments be added to my order, as i did not receive them, which I did receive.  Really, it is that hard to provide what is on the menu to your customer!!"}
{"text":"Amazing corn, but other than that would never go back. Made us wait for over an hour for our entrees. Didnt even come to ask us if we wanted anything else or give us updates. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood restaurant. Whenever I'm thinking of going out to eat Mexican food this one pops in my mind first."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  My teeth hurt from the amount of chewing with the carne asada tacos.  My sister in law had the carne asada platter, same thing.  My brother in law had the chile relleno and the sour cream came out like a sauce.  I ordered a margarita based on the reviews, it was so watered down, couldn't taste the tequila at all.  The service was good though.  The waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"Reviews were very good.. Walked in, walked out. 

Place stunk of major sewer problems. Had to leave, sorry. 

Fix your sewer!"}
{"text":"Consistently quality food and margaritas!!! The staff is very personable and treat every one with the utmost of importance. My favorites are the chilaquiles for breakfast, happy hour is my favorite I love the camarones asados and the fundido!"}
{"text":"Even though we drove by three times before we found this place it was worth it. Musicians played us a romantic song and the vege burrito was delicious. Margaritas were great, too. Wait staff was so nice. A family place."}
{"text":"Best secret in south Scottsdale
Their special was shredded pork cooked in banana leafs. Amazing!
Great margaritas and coconut shrimp too."}
{"text":"I am so happy I was recommended this place by a friend! They have great food and service every time.  The warmest staff too!  I was originally recommended the elote, and it is awesome, but I have fallen in love with their interpretation of the wedge salad."}
{"text":"Great mole enchiladas! So hard to find great mole but they make it fresh here and it is yummy!  Relleno dish was excellent and fresh!  Great friendly service.  Will definitely be back to try the next item on the menu"}
{"text":"Fantastic little stereotypical Mexican place, went for breakfast and everybody loved it. Pancakes, great omelettes and fantastic chilaquiles."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great margs, and amazing food! The mango and prickly pear margaritas were amazing and a great deal for happy hour. The corn (Elote) on the cob was the best. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"First take did not bode well for this fairly unassuming Mexican restaurant as an unpleasant smell nearly sent me back out the door. However, it is impossible to give an objective r view on something with which you have no experience so we sat anyway.  After the chips and salsa arrived we were told that they would have to charge us for a second small container of salsa??  Huh??

Start out with freshly made lemonade which is way too sweet for my tastes. 

BUT... the huevos rancheros were delicious with potatoes, ham, and fresh tortillas smothered in red salsa.

UPDATE:  sorry but this place failed the 30 min test let alone the 3 hour test."}
{"text":"While it might seem a little unassuming from the outside, we thoroughly enjoyed our lunch here. Many reasonably priced food and drink options on the menu. My brother hasn't been able to stop talking about how delicious his enchiladas were with tomatillo sauce. Give this place a try if you are in the area- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was great and service even better. Very attentive to our needs and friendly making us feel welcome like we were sitting down to dinner with friends. The guajillo sauce was not what I expected enchilada sauce to be but was very good all the same."}
{"text":"We stopped in with a bunch of friends last Friday night.  Fantastic margaritas and well prepared dishes.  Everyone was happy and mentioned they were glad to find a place to stop on their way home from work for a good meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I must write a review for my new Favorite Mexican Restaurant!  My husband and I have had dinner here twice in the last month.  The first time we ordered the Chicken Tomatillo Enchiladas and the Steak Asada Quesadilla.  The second time, we shared the Steak Fajitas.  Everything was SO good!  It is family-owned and everything is made to order.  Fresh and delicious!  I don't understand the poor reviews here because our dishes were all very well-balanced.  I must mention also that the Margaritas are just wonderful.  It's a little hard to find, as it is tucked back in a strip mall, but if you love good traditional Mexican food, you'll love this place.  We'll be back here again very soon!

1/3/2017 -- I posted my original review months ago...and we still LOVE this place!  We try to go about once a week and have tried just about everything on the menu, but keep coming back to the Chicken Tinga Tostadas and the Carnitas Platter.  In November, my Mother-in-law turned 90 and we had a birthday luncheon for 12 guests here.  They were so nice and accommodating and it was a perfect day.  I just cannot say enough nice things about No Que No."}
{"text":"Finally, a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix that's actually good. Wtf. Why is it so hard to find a good Mexican restaurant so close to the border?  Anyway, this place was awesome. The waitress was awesome and they went out of their way to be great. My girlfriend doesn't like onions and they specially made some quac without onions and that was really cool. Plus their burritos actually have other ingredients than rice, beans and cheese which is like so unique in Phoenix. And their margaritas are way better than the ones at the Mexican restaurant that I'm eating at now."}
{"text":"Second time here and still loved it! Had the fajitas which were great! Also go the free appetizer - which was excellent. Margs were great; would recommend the elderflower and jalapeño margarita but even the regular one was great! Great service and quiet - perfect for a family dinner."}
{"text":"Oy! No Bueno No! Skip this place. Weird, tasteless, and so not good. There are so many better places than this in town."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage. The management is not trustworthy. The food is terrible and the kitchen is disgusting. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Pretty good. The people there are really nice.  They deliver which is AWESOME. decent food, could use more flavor and more veggie options."}
{"text":"I really really hope this place makes it.  They've pumped a lot of time, energy and money into renovation, and have turned this into a nice sit down restaurant with a full fledged bar.  I went for Lunch today right around Noon and I was the only customer, then one more guy came in after me!  The food is good, the place is clean!  The location is hidden in a small shopping center and you really need to know this place is there when going.  Its difficult to spot just merely driving by on Scottsdale road.  It's family owned and the people are super nice!  I can only suggest as a businessman myself that they pump up their advertising via social media, Facebook etc.  Run specials on living social and groupon.  Run an ad in The New Times.  People have got to know this place exists and how good it truly is.  It would be a travesty to see it fail.  They obviously need volume, and I commend them for serving breakfast, lunch and Dinner!  They're overhead might be low, at least I hope so.  I just realize the importance of numbers in running a successful restaurant, and during peak season like this they need customers!  Please give this place a try.  You'll be glad you did and you'll vow to come back again!  Evidently they have great happy hour specials as well.  Again, I so hope they succeed, certainly well deserved...."}
{"text":"Good food, but definitely NOT worth the waiting through blaring Mexican music, and the smell. Thats an under exaggeration of what the atmosphere. We waited for almost 45 minutes, and when our food came, it was just average. Our family got into a giant fight over where we should go, and the two choices were to keep searching, or go there. When we drove by the restaurant, it looked shady and not very good. Because of this restaurant's four star rating, we decided to go in anyways. Very disappointed, and discourage people from going here."}
{"text":"Went here with my family tonight the staff was very welcoming of us. The young lady server was such a sweetheart. The owner also struck up a conversation with us, very cordial. The place was very clean and cozy. Beers were a very good price! The food was also very very good had the steak tacos. I can't wait to come back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ok, I admit I tend to judge a book by its cover sometimes. Especially a restaurant. I'm so glad I didn't this time! I went with some friends last night and even though the reviews were good, I was skeptical. It was fantastic!! I ordered the Prickly Pear margarita and I'm still dreaming about it, it was that good. Plus it contained a generous amount of tequila (another reason I'm still thinking about it). Dinner for me was a shrimp quesadilla. Delish! Not covered in sauces and garnishes, simple and good with lots of shrimp. Others ordered carne asada tacos, different chicken dishes, everyone enjoyed. It's not fancy, it's not 5 star dining but really good, high quality, nice people and yummy margs. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We have a tradition to try new different restaurants whatever place we visit.  When we visit family in AZ, Tempe-Scottsdale to be exact, we have had our share of Mexican restaurants that have range from average to flat out horrible, but we found this place tucked in the back of a small shopping center.  The food end up being really good, I had the cochinita píbil which is hard to cook and easy to mess up, my plate was good, a bit spicy with a hint of smoked that was not overwhelming.  The drinks were really good, the smoky cucumber habanero was outstanding, and the service was equally great.  My mom cooked the cochinita Pibil for me plenty of times, and this place was the closest I gotten since then."}
{"text":"I don't say this lightly, but I'm pretty confident the majority of 5 star reviews on here are fake. Note how many of these people have fewer than 10
Reviews total..... that's a pretty good indicator that there is some BS afoot. 

The food is very poor quality and tasted bad. The chips are store bought and stale. The salsa was fresh and good, but somehow their hot salsa was less spicy than the regular version. For dinner I had the steak fajitas. When they arrived the quality of meat was visibly poor, with a weird grey color.  The flavor was no bueno and overall it was so surprising- as I believed all the great reviews. 

Luckily my date was her usual charming, beautiful self- so there was one highlight. Otherwise I have to suggest you go somewhere else for Mexican food. When the word \"No\" is in the name twice- that's a good clue."}
{"text":"We've been here twice so far - just my husband and I the first time and then with a group the second time. Everything we've had has been great and everyone in our group seems to have enjoyed their meal as well. So far we've tried the tomatillo enchiladas, the shrimp fajitas, and the asada quesadilla. The shrimp fajitas are my favorite so far, and you get a ton of shrimp - I just needed a few more tortillas and it would have been perfect. The tomatillo enchiladas were great but a tad spicy for me, and my husband loved his asada quesadilla. 

The staff is very friendly and welcoming as well, which is always a plus! They gave us a complimentary flan which was sweet and kind of creamy (I was expecting something like the jello-y stuff you make from the box). We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm all about good Mexican. This was mediocre at best.

I am not about food poisoning.  A group of my colleagues are here one night and two of us ended up in the bathroom all night. No que no is a nunca mas."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is a little erie. I almost feel like I am in a scene from Big Trouble in Little China, but the food kicks ass and the coconut shrimp are top of the line!"}
{"text":"This was the best Mexican food I've had in ages. We came in late on Mother's Day and I felt kinda bad, but the service and food was still fantastic. We all enjoyed our dishes - from carnitas tacos to fajitas to chicken enchiladas. We also had desserts, which were delicious as well. The restaurant is a little tough to find due to being set back from the street in a not overly busy strip mall, but it's well worth it. Our server mentioned happy hour as well so I'm definitely interested in checking that out too. I've been to the fairly well reviewed Los Sombreros across the street a couple of times and was unimpressed. No Què No will definitely be my go to Mexican spot in Scottsdale from now on!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding and I can't wait to go back!!! I was in the hospital for Valentine's Day and my boyfriend asked me to pick a local restaurant to deliver dinner to my room for us. The food was amazing and fresh and so delicious and the service for the delivery exceeded our expectations. I don't know the name of the gentleman that answered the phone when my boyfriend called just to confirm the online order (which worked seamlessly by the way) or the name of the gentleman that delivered our fantastic dinner, but they sure helped to make our hospital Valentine's Day very special! Thank you !!!!! 

Room 624 :-)"}
{"text":"The food and service is great.  This is an authentic Mexican restaurant and you can't go wrong here.  Try the Carne Asada!"}
{"text":"Had the Huevos Rancheros for breakfast and they were really good. Place was super clean as well."}
{"text":"Poor service, staff acts like you're bothering them,  The food my daughter and I ordered was sub par and cold, we came on a Tuesday evening around 7pm and it was clear that we weren't really wanted.  The place was pretty empty and i guess they wanted to go home.
There are such good eateries all around the area and MUCH better mexican food and service to be had.  I cannot understand the 5 stars unless they are paying relatives to review them.
my advice don't waste your time and money here on dinner."}
{"text":"Smoking good. Best shrimp tacos I've ever eaten. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. A+"}
{"text":"Unfortunately Golden State lost but who cares?  The Cochinita Pibil and the Rellenos w creme sauce were winners with us!!  
I don't remember the name of margaritas but we thought they were excellent, a little pineapple and a hint of jalapeño. 

We really enjoyed and will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! Shrimp tacos are bomb, best elote corn EVER, and try the camarones asados appetizer! They have a great happy hour from 2 till 6 daily! $3 house margaritas (killer buzz from 2) and all appetizers are only $5(some are originally $11) its a must try!!!! All the staff are amazing, constantly checking up on you and getting you what you need. Its never busy but thats even better because your service is better that way!"}
{"text":"Wow what a jewel!  This place not only has an extensive great bar menu (not to mention the bartender will work with you) but their food menu makes it very difficult to try and choose something. 
With a group we tried the guac, chicken mole enchiladas, camarones asados - each one was excellent!! They also have an interesting breakfast menu which I will be anxious to try. 
The restaurant is family owned and you just get a comforting vibe there."}
{"text":"Horrible food. I've lived here for 12 years, and this is by far the worst Mexican food I've had.
I wish fiesta delivered!!!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! Perfect service. I had the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde. So tasty and fresh. Spicy though! Salsa was delish. Everyone in my family was very happy with their food. Overheard
over customers remarking on how great the food was, too. We will all be back again."}
{"text":"Great flavor. In shopping center. Random location. Went on a Sunday at 12:30,  football season. 4 tables and ours made 5. Maria the waitress was alone and i didn't feel the service lacked at all. She was helpful and knew the menu. She's a keeper. Had the fajitas. A burger and a burrito.  All was great flavor. Worth the Uber from Sun City. Margs were #delish."}
{"text":"Sitting at the table now and it is so good I had to stop to write a review. Ordered the happy hour  3$ margs 5$ apps good coconut shrimp, garlic shrimp with prickly pear fruit, and Oaxaca cheese dip plus and live mariachi band. Def worth checking out"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast omelette, home fries and toast!! Fast and friendly service. Nice decor and comfortable seating. will be back!!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has 4 stars. People must have terrible taste in food quality. The place was completely empty because the food is terrible. Do NOT get the queso fundido. EW. It was like they stuck a mozzarella cheese stick in the microwave and put it on a plate (before it was even done melting all the way). We ordered the chicken tomatillo enchiladas and chicken fajitas. Again, EW. Aside from it tasting terrible, the chicken looked really scary. The service was absolutely terrible. We watched our waiter just sit behind the bar on his phone while we waited for the check for like 20 minutes. We will never be back here. Don't waste your time either."}
{"text":"Just no...

The people seem pretty nice.  They have some kind of $3 beer special that sounds interesting.  They also have a fridge with Mexican version of sodas in there which I wish I saw coming in.

We took our food to go since we had groceries in the car.  Carne asada platter and carnitas platter.  The carne asada was cut into long thin strips of overcooked dry meat.  They lacked flavor and kinda seemed reheated.  The carnitas were better.  At about 15 a piece, I've never been so underwhelmed with the portion of rice and beans we got with the meal.  The meat portion was probably closer to a $7 meal elsewhere.  The pico de gallo was decent, and the guacamole is overmixed and underseasoned.

I think this place could be fun to drink in with a large group, but eating the food sober is not fun.  The prices are even less fun.  I will definitely stick to the more authentic spots nearby."}
{"text":"We had breakfast there today. The guacamole was good a little heavy on lime and cilantro.  The ground beef tacos were great!! Refills on the Arnold Palmers were appreciated. The Carne Asada had a nice flavor ."}
{"text":"No question that this place has delicious authentic Mexican food with phenomenal service. The food, especially the (shrimp and cactus) has me coming back every time. Nearly the entirety of each platters homemade. If nothing else, come here for from-scratch flan. 

10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Great home feeling. Authentic Mexican food. Huge burritos! A little pricey... $20 for 2 burritos... But they are big & good."}
{"text":"No Que No is a wonderful little family place.  The ambiance is a little off somehow, but the food I've had has been great.  We order the shrimp with nopales appetizer every time we go there and have never been disappointed.  The conchanitas pibil was also really yummy."}
{"text":"It is very average Mexican food. The service is great and it was not too busy. The food is nothing special, definitely not worth driving out of the way for. If you are in the area and are craving fajitas, then by all means, stop here. +1 for the free queso if you check-in!"}
{"text":"Everything made from scratch at this place. One of the best Mexican food restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just amazing, the food is great, you can also find some dish that you never imagine to try in others Mexican restaurant, the taste is great as Camarones Asados ( with Nopales) or Cochinita Pibil, I love it, they prepare really good drinks and they have the best happy hour! The service is beyond than great and kind and profesional, I thrully recommend it."}
{"text":"This food was good and love that there is breakfast served as well. For an appetizer we had the Oaxaca Queso Fundido, and it was very good! I had a chicken quesadilla and enjoyed the dish."}
{"text":"What a fabulous find!  There were ten of us in our group today.  We were able to take part in the happy hour menu prices.  Most of us started with the homemade sangria which was soooo good.  Some of the things that we enjoyed:  perfectly done coconut shrimp, grilled shrimp, fresh made guacamole, real chili rellenos, carnitas, huge taco salad.  The service was outstanding.  Returning to this restaurant is a must!!"}
{"text":"We decided being in AZ we had to get some Mexican food and this place did NOT disappoint! I got the pickled pear margarita and It was the best margarita I have ever had and I live in Las Vegas (home of alcohol). The salsa they give with the chips was also just unreal how flavorful it was. Both plates we got (steak tacos and chicken quesadilla) were so good! Will return when we come back!"}
{"text":"Great dive place in Scottsdale, super friendly service and the food is authentic. Prices are decent for Scottsdale, but, would be slightly overpriced elsewhere. Worth coming back!"}
{"text":"This little secret place is so delicious. The food is amazing and the service is great! We will definitely be back. They offer unique dishes which are authentic while also offering typical tacos, enchiladas, etc."}
{"text":"We started out with the salsa and chips. I wasn't crazy about the multi-colored chips (red, green, purple and natural). Seems kind of gimmicky (and I'm not so fond of food coloring). But they are served warm and the salsa that comes with it is great--a rich mix of flavor that doesn't over-power.

My wife and daughter had Virgin margaritas, which were good.

They also ordered the corn (on the cob), which was excellent--really almost a meal unto itself.

I split a beef and chicken fajita with my daughter. The chicken was very good--tender and well-seasoned. The beef tasted okay but was a bit chewy for my liking--the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars.

Portions are very generous and the service friendly and attentive. And lastly, the bathrooms are clean.

A nice place we would visit again when in Scottsdale / Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Decent food.  I checked in and got free queso fundido.  The taste was good, the pico was yummy but the queso was stringy from the time they set it down.  You couldn't dip really after a couple min but we still wanted to eat it because it was good, the texture was like mozzarella sticks and wasn't easy to eat.

Ok I was totally sick to my stomach the night I ate it, but just found out 3 of the 4 of the people I ate with where super sick at the same time as me.  The only thing we all ate was the guacamole and the yummy pico and we didn't eat anything the same before or after this.  So I won't be returning.  As it was probably the guac I question the cleanliness cause how can guac make you sick?  Don't know.  What I do know is the toilets were the ones saying \"NO QUE NO!\""}
{"text":"The chk enchiladas were very good! The service is amazing and I will be a frequent customer."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and so yummy!  The coconut shrimp appetizer was my favorite. Service was spot on and so polite!  We found a new favorite Mexican Food place!"}
{"text":"We love this place!   The food is really good (we go weekly) and the drinks are too!  My favorite is a ginger margarita.  The owners are the nicest people too.  The prices are reasonable.  The ginger margarita is $8 and the average price for dinners is $10-12.  I hear they have a great breakfast too.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Food here is not authentic Mexican food. Rice was bland, beans taste like from a can and just overall food tasted synthetic. Ordered a cocktail drink and that even tasted like cough medicine. I rather take the drive into South Phx for real Mexican food and even Fiesta burrito on McDowell Rd has better food than this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time I've tried mole. Was so good. Staff very friendly and accommodating. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly and fast service, delicious margaritas! We had the chicken enchiladas, fish tacos and a chicken burrito"}
{"text":"Terrific variety, lovely service! I ordered the taco salad with lots of changes (no dressing, just pico and salsa, no shell because I already gorged on the amazing chips). They were completely accommodating and kind about it. My friend loved his enchiladas, and the churros were filled with dulce de leche. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is the first place I've been to in Scottsdale to serve Pibil. This is a way to serve pork after it marinating and slow cooking in a certain kind of sauce and spices and you can get it in Any which way you can think here. The inside is cute and the restrooms were clean. We must've come on a slow night but it was nice to get the attention. The other two Families there were enjoying themselves greatly as well. Watch out for some extra charges you wouldn't think of though , like for more than the first serving of chips on the table. Also don't expect any salsa to be real hot. No worries there I guess after my husband asked for the hottest they had and we were brought out a dish of some homemade salsa. Great flavor but not a lot of heat."}
{"text":"Eager staff that merits your attention.  Unfortunately the promising menu comes across as more cafeteria and less homemade.  This point is accentuated when you go across the street to sample the masterfully executed food at Los Sombreros.  Maybe on a future visit I could sample something that is more impressive than the mole from my first visit."}
{"text":"Everything I have gotten here has been so good. Service is great, the staff is super nice and prompt. Best authentic Mexican restaurant I have been to in the Phoenix valley."}
{"text":"While the food was delicious and everything we tried was great, I am not sure I will be back. The plates were a bit over priced (although the serving sizes were generous). The florescent lighting in the restaurant kind of gave it a strange vibe and it took quite a while for our food to come out. I think with a few small changes, this place could be really great."}
{"text":"Brought 10 friends with me to have lunch at No Que No!  Everyone enjoyed their food and especially the coconut shrimp, fish tacos and even the wedge salad. The fish tacos did not have a fishy taste and the way they were served - they stayed hot. Other people ordered carnitas and chile rellenos and all were superb. The sangria was homemade and really tasty.  Everyone said they would go back.  Big surprise at the end of the meal - Costa and Maria brought us a homemade dessert with apples and cinnamon but that is all I can say because it is a secret recipe!  Better check it out!  I will be going back for the weekend breakfast specials at No Que No!"}
{"text":"Great find, full of flavor.  Authentic Yucatan cuisine.  Wonderful service and great, clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food far exceeded my expectations. The beans and the rice were just not like every other place. So much flavor! I had the carne asada taco platter. I'm just visiting here or this would be a regular stop!! Don't be fooled by the dated look. This place is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"One word. Amazing! I'm so upset I didn't find this place sooner. Not only was the food absolutely phenomenal but service here is also astonishing! We sat ourselves upon walking in and we were served drinks within the minute. Then our order was taken so promptly. This place isn't a fast food restaurant but it certainly felt like it in a sense because we received our food so fast. First the chips and salsa came which were fresh as fresh can be. Then the food came shortly after and I was Floored. All I really have to say is that this is now my favorite place to eat and I will be bringing everyone I know here! A++ on all categories!"}
{"text":"All I can say is some of the best huevos rancheros and chiliqueles I've ever had. This place was serving breakfast and although it was quiet on a Labor Day morning, the food was fantastic.
Most dishes came with meat, but the cooks can alter it as you like. Our server was so friendly and smiley. Food arrived quickly and was just so damn good. 
I'm sure dinner menu is just as tasty, but for a delicious Mexican style breakfast, this is my new favorite."}
{"text":"This place is not going to have great decor which doesn't matter at all. It's not about the scenery only about the food here. A family run restaurant offering great flavors. The shrimp cooked in garlic, lime, and red cooking wine was simply delicious! Tonight, I choose the shrimp burrito which was plenty filling. This place is a winner if your craving America's version of Mexican Food."}
{"text":"The place lacks the atmosphere and warm service I was hoping to get. The food was decent. We had the beef fajita. First set of chips and salsa were complimentary. It was a decent amount but not that amazing to order a refill."}
{"text":"Just ate at this restaurant and it was delicious! I live in the neighborhood and didn't even know it existed. It's in a small plaza off of Scottsdale Road and I wouldn't have noticed it, but my husband saw it and suggested we eat there. Great service and good prices. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Both service and food were great at this restaurant. Bit of an odd location as it is located in (what seems to be) a dying strip mall - but centrally located between Thomas and McDowell Rd, on Scottsdale. 
Portions were great and the food very tasty. Margaritas didn't disappoint either! 
Burrito was very tasty! I'd be sure to return to try more items off their menu - lots of good options listed. 
This restaurant met/exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and price."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about, but good Mexican food if not a little boring choice-wise. Common food fare with good flavor. Good parking, good location, clean, decent prices, and kind waitstaff. Allover a pretty decent experience if not forgettable."}
{"text":"Our family came from the Seattle area, a place almost entirely bereft of good traditional Mexican food. Naturally one of our goals was to find a place that had some. Boy, do they.

The horchata was freshly made from scratch and tasted incredible. The mexican corn on the cob was really interesting, with a lot of good acid hints combined with a great smokiness. Both kids really liked the Carne Asada and devoured the Arroz that came with it. My wife was very happy with the enchilada in tomatillo sauce - a sauce similar to their salsa, and full of great vibrant flavors and nicely spicy. I had the Cochinita Pibil - and with the pickled onions, habanero and their handmade guacamole it was awesome.

But oddly, the thing that I crave the most from there was their refried beans. Their beans are made from scratch, use pork fat and renderings for cooking, and are unlike any other refried beans I've ever had. They were absolutely incredibly tasty. My wife informs me that this is how they're supposed to be made, and after having them I feel offended that all the other places don't make them like this. They're great. 

Prices were really good too, and the service was very nice. If we ever end up in Scottsdale again we'll take another trip."}
{"text":"Salsa, Fajitas and coconut shrimp were really good.  The waiter was so nice and eager to please.  It was pretty empty around 7pm on Saturday night.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale & trying diff rest. We stumbled upon here during HH. Atmosphere is not a Sol but a mom & pop rest. We like to support those. Appetizers of coconut shrimp & camarinre asades were great. Also the special marguerita that is equivalent to a Cadillac was super. The steak fajitas I would pass on. All PEPPERS & onions. Ugh. The chix enchiladas were just ok. But street corn was super. Worth coming here for those things. Waiter was very accommodating. Sweet staff."}
{"text":"Really good place. Excellent service. Combo fajitas were enough for my wife and I. 
Margaritas were very good (kinda pricey). 
My wife asked for corn tortillas with fajitas, the waitress said, \"sure let me go make them for you\" and she did. 

Good stuff"}
{"text":"One word sums it up... authentic! But to add to that, the food is delicious and so are the margaritas. Everything is made from scratch and you can certainly tell. Everyone is friendly and takes pride in what they do. If you ask Maria how she makes such a good drink she'll tell you, she just makes them with love."}
{"text":"This is a great spot in South Scottsdale.  We took eleven family members the evening after Thanksgiving and the staff handled them well.  They set a long table up for us that allowed us to move around and talk with each other.  Everyone was hungry so I ordered guacamole and their queso.  Both were a hit.  The margaritas were well made.  Everything we ordered from quesadillas to their cochitino pibil was delicious.  The carnitas are great also.  This is a hometown spot for every day and to bring visitors.  They had mariachis and they kept the entire restaurant lively."}
{"text":"I felt welcomed here from the start. Ordered Carne asada. Normally it is single piece of meat, but this was cut in straps, eliminating the fat.  Tasted great. Thanks to Yelp, ordered free dessert - homemade flan...with just a touch of nutmeg. Great choice"}
{"text":"Peg and I were told about this place by one of Peg's friend, and are we thrilled that we checked it out!  I know that we all have individual preferences for Mexican food. When we aren't able to go to Barrio or Barrio Urbano, we have gone to several places when we have the urge. This mom-and-pop (actually aunt-and-uncle) is now on our extremely short list. The coconut shrimp (who knew!) was perfectly cooked and loaded with coconut...served with a sweet mildly hot chili sauce. I had the Shrimp Fajita which was wonderful,,,shrimp not overcooked, vegetables cooked just enough and not mushy...guacamole, pinto beans VERY good and not tasting like they came out of a #10 can.  Peg had the Guajillo Enchilada which was also wonderful and the guajillo sauce (dried ancho chiles, dried guajillo chiles, garlic cloves, dried Mexican oregano,sea salt, hot water) was incredible We wanted to try the Elote on the Cob (think authentic Mexican street corn) but simply ran out of room.  No Que No! also serves breakfast and this will be next up. They are open seven days a week and open at 7 am. Chef Ramon putting together spectacular food with Maria and Gustavo out front....this is a true gem of a find. \"Why Not\" indeed!"}
{"text":"It's been years since I've written a review but this place is just so good!  The service is always warm & friendly and the food is delicious.  The elote is a must on every visit, as well as one of the dishes with cochinita pibil."}
{"text":"Love this place. The gal that was working when I was there is amazing, reminded me of my mom! 

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros cuz ya I do that a lot. Good news? It was bomb delicious. I ate pretty much all of a very big plate. I also had the inferno margarita!! Omg sweet and spicy! Get one mannnng!

I'll come here anytime I'm in Phoenix and feeling like some home cooked delicious goodies."}
{"text":"I am always looking for authentic Mexican food, especially on Scottsdale Rd. I found it! Great service, friendly, clean and tasty.  I had the tomatillo chicken enchiladas and they were the right kind of spicy. I look forward to exploring their other menu items. Don't let the strip mall dissuade you; the inside of the restaurant is beautiful and welcoming. Full bar and tvs inside. This is a family owned business and it's exactly what is needed in a world of chain restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is hidden and worth the trip.  I have been here several times.  We tried the bean and cheese burrito, carne asada burrito, coconut shrimp and a chicken quesadilla.  The food is fresh and tasty.  I like the green sauce and guacamole they give you.  Even the chips and salsa are great!  The place is nice and clean and the staff is really friendly.  They now have happy hour 2pm-6pm with half off appetizer and $3 drink specials.  I still want to try the breakfast omelette's as I hear they are really good too."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly staff, large portions! My wife and I thought it was very good."}
{"text":"We kept hearing this was a great happy hour value.....and it's true! Coconut Shrimp is awesome....perfect texture and yummy dipping sauce. Elite corn is amazing and our margaritas were totally delicious...no store bought mix....all fresh ingredients.  

Rest of the menu looks very good....we are going back to try the street tacos!  Great friendly service...a real find!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place.  No frills, just good solid Mexican food.  The service was good, place was place and the food tasty."}
{"text":"Does not live up to the photographs or other reviews. The chicken mole was meh -- on the sweeter bland side as mole goes. The cochinita was decent. The rice and beans were on par with a canned product except not entirely warmed up. The guacamole and pickled onions which came with the cochinita were not very good, particularly the red onions were extremely spicy with the over abundance of mixed in habaneros. Our two beers on draft were flat and not carbonated. The food was average at best with poor plate presentation that did not match the pricing, and the atmosphere was worse, especially the ultra bright fluorescent lighting. The staff was friendly and the restaurant is close to home, so I hope they are able to improve their food quality and atmosphere to stay in business."}
{"text":"Have never written a review but have to say that in just one visit we're already declaring it the most authentic, fresh, made from scratch, satisfying meal we've experienced among all the best Mexican food places we frequent. So we had to share a review with you. We also met owner Gustavo and family and saw the passion for what they're doing. Cool.

So listen up. If you live in Arcadia, PV, Central Scottsdale or north Tempe, go there soon and support the kind of food we had, which included a savory, lean Pibil, a crunchy/tangy Tinga Chicken Torta w Caesar and...the best shrimp tacos of all time. Oh and Beans that stayed hot and Rice that could only come from a homemade recipe. And did I mention the full bar and 7a weekend morning opening?"}
{"text":"I was having my car worked on across the street and was very hungry. I discovered this amazing little gem!!! 

The quality and quantity of food here is incredible! I ordered the Veggie Burro enchilada style. I was hesitant on not doing meat because I was so hungry, I was nervous it wouldn't be enough. It was definitely enough!!! The burrito was gigantic and was one of the most flavorful delicious burritos I have ever experienced!!!

The owner, Maria, and her nephew were very kind and friendly. It was a very welcoming environment. Maria informed me all of their ingredients are fresh prepared at the restaurant daily. You can certainly taste the difference!

This will definitely be my number one go to for Mexican food moving forward!! I highly recommend No Que No when your taste buds crave something amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many restaurants throughout the world and when in the Southwest or Mexico I always try to find a home cooked Mexican meal.. guess what, I found it. There is a cactus appetizer that is amazing and everything from the salsa to the citrus cooked pork was fantastic.. 

This is not fast food, it is real Mexican home cooking, enjoy... oh, nice to have a full bar as well, bonus.

One last thing, the place was spotless, I am always comfortable when I go to a restaurant and they keep it cleaner than my kitchen, and believe me we keep it clean.. 

I noticed a review where someone mentioned a friend got ill from eating Mexican food. I wish I had a nickel for every time a friend I was with got sick eating spicy food, some folks need to be careful what they eat... or what they mix with there meals.."}
{"text":"It has been a year and a half since my first review back when No Que No was pretty new... they've become one of my favorite restaurants and I have been here almost every week for the past year because I can't stay away. Their food is consistently delicious, the staff is always friendly and remembers our favorite table, the prices are fantastic - just a wonderful place every time! My favorites are the shrimp tacos, the carne asada burro, the coconut shrimp appetizer....everything here is sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Did not even get a chance to try the food. They never delivered. Kept lying that the driver was out... for an hour and a half. After complaining for two hours to Eat24, I cancelled the order. Driver arrived over 2 hours after placing the order. You can figure out the details with that time in mind. Driver had my number all along. Never called. So it was not that he couldn't find me. I read the reviews and the food must be worth trying. Just don't ask for delivery."}
{"text":"Having lived 6 (long) years in El Paso, we've been disappointed by most of the Mexican restaurants here in Scottsdale...until now!  This place is the real deal...everything homemade, with great service and fantastic food.  We started with delicious homemade tomatillo salsa, followed by the best chile rellenos I've had in town.  Chilaquiles were fantastic as well! Great value for quality...can't wait to be back!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour prices compared to the overpriced Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale. Great prices overall! I had the plain ole quesadilla and well it was like any other yummy quesadilla! The basil lemon margarita was definitely my favorite thing!!! WOW! Service was wonderful too."}
{"text":"Best mole in Scottsdale!

I'm right, so don't argue about it.

Sign me,

David \"Mole loco\" M."}
{"text":"No nó no!

I read these five star reviews and I'm baffled. What happened to our experience? Did we eat here on an incredibly off night? Because I felt like there was a problem with most every part of our experience. 

Drinks and food took forever to be sent to our table. I'd understand if the food was unbelievable.... some things are worth waiting for. But this is not. My date was not thrilled about the tricolor store-bought chips to accompany our tomatillo salsa (which was the best part of our meal. Tasty little kick and good flavor). We then requested their spiciest salsa. When it finally meandered out, we were confused. It was thin and looked good, however it was even less spicy than the tomatillo and had little to no flavor at all. 

My elote looked good with a lovely char, but was slightly undercooked. I asked for the fish tacos with no sides, but I think the server misunderstood and took that to mean no nothing except fish + corn tortillas, so that was a bit of a bust. The steak fajitas ordered came out as chicken fajitas. So tack on some more time for that correction. And when it came out, the steak was not good quality and was a weird shade for steak.

I love little places like this and I hate to leave a negative review. But after sitting on this for a while, I think it's important to note our issues."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at how this restaurant has 4 stars. My family and I were visiting from Tucson. We're not familiar with Scottsdale or Phoenix for that matter. We yelped and this place seemed decent and was the closest to our hotel so we went. We went on a Saturday evening around 7pm and upon arriving we were shocked that the place was dead considering the reviews we had seen on Yelp. As soon as we walked in I was hit by this horrible stench. Almost mildew-like. I immediately suggested we leave but my family was excited about eating here and refused. Needless to say, that even when choosing the safest item on the menu (a burrito) they managed to mess it up. As soon as I cut into my burrito, I could smell the sour cream was bad. Smelled like old milk when it sits out for a while. Ewww! I told the waitress and she agreed to give me another without the sour cream and this time that burrito's beans were so bland and so gross that it literally killed my appetite. One bite and I was done. So disappointed especially when you go in hungry and ready to order it all. And just as I had feared, I totally woke up with a bad stomachache the following morning. Ugh."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Give this place a try.  You will not be disappointed.  We are from out of town visiting and we found this place after looking on Yelp.  Glad we found it.  Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a meal at this place.  You can thank me later!"}
{"text":"So gross. I think they served us cat urine on top of the food. $40 for 2 plates of Asada? They were supposed to deliver and decided not to after hours of waiting. We prepaid for the food. They said it was listed n the website that only orders over $60 would be delivered. Who orders $60 worth of Mexican food for two?  Took our money and pissed on the food. We are calling the Scottsdale health department and trying to close them down. Please stay way, The place has folding chairs and sick atmosphere They close at 9pm on a Saturday night. Wow hopping place."}
{"text":"Blissfully full. That's what I am right now, as I just finished my meal, my first ever from No Què No. Where do I even begin? I guess from the beginning.
The interior - spacious and cozy at the same time. I instantly felt comfortable walking through the door.
The staff - so nice, helpful, and very attentive. Your water will never go empty and you won't want it to, it's the most clean and crisp water you can get in a restaurant. Really.  No tap water here.
Chips and salsa - the freshest, most flavorful chips I've have in forever and OMG the salsa. Forget the usual salsa that tastes like it was out of a jar, this stuff is legit. Smoky with a little heat to go along with the lovely savory tomato taste. Delicious.
Dinner - I ordered the shrimp fajitas, which comes with a side of beans and the extras you'd want: guacamole, pico de gallo, and crema. This place does not know the word stingy!  18 whole pieces of shrimp, a ton of yummy veggies (sweet onion, red and green bell peppers) and three small flour tortillas. I would recommend getting an extra order of tortillas because you're going to want to eat it all!  I know I did. Blissfully full, remember?  Oh and the rice!!  Definitely a family recipe and it's very very tasty, unlike the usual rice you get elsewhere.  As for the guac, pico, and crema?  Delicious. Fresh. Wonderful. In my tummy. Yep. If it goes in my tummy you know it's gotta be good. 
Dessert - Flan. Freaking fabulous flan. Seriously some of the best flan I have ever had. It's this silky thick custard texture on top of what I can only describe as a dense sponge cake. So different and so decadent. Poured over was a sugary reduced sauce that I think included a touch of espresso liqueur?  Whatever it was, there wasn't a drop left as I didn't want to leave any behind.
Everyone, I urge you to visit this establishment. You will be not be disappointed, but in a state of euphoric satisfaction as I am now. Thank you for the most excellent food!"}
{"text":"I recently celebrated a birthday at this restaurant based upon the recommendation of a friend. Our group of 10 received GREAT service and amazing food to match. All 10 of us from from a variety of tastes and backgrounds found something to love on the menu from basics like tacos and tortas to chicken moles and cochinita pibil. The drinks and happy hour specials are a steal. Everyone likes to brag about an unpretentious hole-in-the-wall kind of place that nobody knows about where the food is great and the service matches. This is a hidden gem. Muchisimas gracias a todos por un Cumpleanos de Pelos aqui en No Que No! Porque No?"}
{"text":"Next  I am skipping the food going directly to the margaritas and desert!!! 

The are restaurant is a bit hot..."}
{"text":"So my husband and I were in Az visiting from San Francisco, California and found this gem. I must say the food is wonderful and the service is unbeatable. They welcomed us in and checked on us several times. We felt like family. We ordered the steak and shrimp fajitas and the tomatillo (verde) chicken enchiladas. They were delicious. I urge yall to come through and support this family business. Nice set up inside also. If you drink (i don't) they have a fully stocked bar equipped to make just about anything."}
{"text":"Warning!! This place refused to honor my voucher from Yelp. It was not expired or anything, The manager said, \"your problem is with Yelp, NOT me.\" I can't vouch for the food one way or another, as he upset me and my wife so much, we just left."}
{"text":"First timers to No Que No, and the hubby and I fell in love with the people and food! The corn on the cob was outstanding, as was everything else. Give this place a try! It will be your new favorite go to Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"You rarely go to a Mexican restaurant that doesn't have chimichangas or burritos on the menu & this one doesn't. They give you 1 very small basket of store bought chips - hideous fake red, blue & bright green??? YUCK! The tomatillo salsa is good, but the menu says refills are $2??   The house margarita is fair, weak, weird tasting, but it is only 1 penny for checking in on Yelp, so ya get what ya pay for.... The service is good, staff are friendly, but with only 4 tables the kitchen was too slow. The cheese enchiladas  in mole sauce were only fair, and were almost cold, beans & rice unremarkable. The sour cream watery?? Chicken quesadilla wasn't served with any salsa, just the watery sour cream. Go to Los Sombreros instead if in this part of town."}
{"text":"WARNING  for dinner 5/5/17: Came in for cinco de mayo and they had a single page printed menu with one a couple items available. No descriptions were provided at all. No cheese dip was available for the yelp offer. When we asked for it, a manager came out and told us that it was impossible because ALL THE FOOD IS PRE-MADE and they are just REHEATING IT, and making cheese dip takes too long?!?! Reheating it? That's food poisoning waiting to happen. Also there were no taco available at all and the place wasn't even busy.."}
{"text":"¡Si que si!

Popped in for breakfast. Had the chilaquiles and blta torta. Both delicious. Order the hot sauce if you dare ;)"}
{"text":"Favorite locally owned Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale! Love happy hour because I can get some delicious margs and sangria for cheaper than everywhere else. Talking with the owner every time I've been in is also great, since he's the one personally taking care of you!"}
{"text":"First time in Scottsdale and this place was everything I had hoped for!  The margarita was on pointe and the spicy pork carnitas are to die for!  My friends and I talked about those carnitas the entire trip.  It's a must try!!  Thank you for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"this place is not bad! nothing like crazy or innovative going on in here. its basically just a nice, chill, local vibe type place

margarita was great"}
{"text":"Yum! Love this place. A new neighborhood Mexican restaurant with delicious and strong margaritas! I don't think I could walk out of here after more than 2 margaritas. They also have clase azul blanco for under $20 which is my favorite and a good price.

I had the grilled shrimp served with grilled nopales aka cactus, nice flavors and a healthier option compared to some of the more traditional Mexican food around town. 

It's family owned and family run which always makes for the best costumer service because they really care about your experience."}
{"text":"Ahhh this was good! I would be a regular if I lived closer. 

The food seemed to be made from scratch, which you'll taste for yourself after a few bites. 

The chips and salsa were great, hard to save room for my meal. We ordered the Chicken Tinga Tostadas appetizer to share along with the Red Chilaquiles dish. Both were flavored so well, the chicken tinga was not dry, had great flavor and the two tostadas were much larger than we anticipated. The chilaquiles were also wonderful, not sogged down with sauce, but also not dry and were topped with crema and cotija cheese. The beans were refried, but not completely pureed, which we really enjoyed. 

We both felt you could taste the time and energy put into their dishes. Small, family run, kind staff,  and very clean. We experienced really fast service, but it was not too busy. They seem to be struggling a little bit to get people in the door. They're a little hidden in a strip mall. So please go in and support this local family run business!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic time enjoying this new restaurant. The name intrigued us along with the location being very easy for us to get to.
 No Que´ No  really offers very friendly service, really delicious food and that made us plan to come back very soon.   
      Betty had the carnitas and they were so good, she had to order more tortillas to eat it all.  I had the taco salad.  I know it's not an authentic Mexican dish, but it was what I was in the mood for.  All of the lettuce was fresh and not one wierd piece of browning core! ( These days, every salad I get has at least one brownish/whitish or chunk in it).  I loved the seasoning of the ground beef and the lightness of the huge taco shell.   
      The owner at No Que´No takes great care to pay attention to details and it showed.   While talking to him after dinner, we found out that they are working on getting better and better.   Also they are especially wanting to get the word out that they serve breakfast.  We look forward to trying that out!     
    Give them a try, we loved it and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This was a good stop. I really enjoyed all of the margaritas I had, and the happy hour pricing was phenomenal. The tacos were delicious, as the cliantro and onion perfectly complemented the carne asade tucked away in a soft corn shell. I would however like to see a bottomless chips and salsa option, because the complementary portion was small and where i'm from, they keep em coming! other than that, i would stop in and check this place out again!"}
{"text":"Came in from San Diego and searched for a sports bar to watch first game of the MLB WW (Cubs lost). But, our win was to find this place! Great drinks, friendly staff, and great authentic regional Mexican food.  Man, it was delicious! Happy to have spent the time and money there. We now love Scottsdale! Ordered the tacos Pibil and the No Que No Margaritas. The Pibil is not common-marinated pork with specific seasoning and care in cooking-out of sight.

The bartender is hip and a veteran of his craft. This place is legit and worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from some neighbors on Nextdoor, and since we live in the same hood, we were excited to try it out.  We were NOT disappointed.  Everything was very fresh, and had great flavor.  My sister in law was visiting from Paris and craving real Mexican food, as it is painfully difficult to find in Paris.  She loved this place.  She had the taco platter - cochinita - and loved it!  I had the carnitas fajitas, which were also very good.  My husband had the mole enchiladas, and they were a bit spicy for him (he doesn't tolerate spice well)...the food here is definitely a little on the spicy side.  But he said the enchiladas had great flavor.  We started out with their Oaxaca Fundido, which was AMAZING!  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So close to be a great spot but the chips tasted stale, the salsa was watery but they were offset by great guacamole and huge burrito's  The burro's are on the pricey side at $12 but they are fully packed and can really be cut in half and saved for a second meal.  The beer selection is also pathetic, your typical macro brews and Mexican beers, they could benefit by adding San Tan's Lime beer and Papago's Orange Blossom to their menu."}
{"text":"Wow and yum. Found this on Yelp and it was outstanding. Maria recommended the Shrimp fajitas and they were very flavorful and lots of shrimp. Taco salad was fresh and crisp all the way through.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was ok , 

Came on my lunch hour and it took them 45 minutes  to take our credits. So we came in at 12 didn't leave till 2pm. 

They weren't even sorry about it. They acted upset more then anything. The food wasn't worth the hassle or trouble. I have ate at our Mexican restaurants that was a lot better service and food. Strongly recommended not coming here. Unless you can invest time in waiting for your credit card to be processed."}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp as I was looking for some good authentic mexican food in Scottsdale area.  Was pleasantly surprise with this place - tucked away in a small strip mall, the place is clean and the owner is very friendly. Lots of options on the menu - I opted for the steak fajitas with flour tortillas.  The steak was very tender with just the right amount of seasoning.  Perfect sized portions and the guacomole had a nice spice to it.  I will certainly be returning and recommend that you check this place out!"}
{"text":"Had the carne asada taco platter, thought it was excellent. Meat had a great flavor to it. Very good chips and salsa as well. Great service and atmosphere, will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. The owners and management are very personable and accommodating."}
{"text":"This is a great little gem that serves delicious food. We have been twice now and really love all they do. The cucumber chipotle margaritas are fabulous and the service is great! A good time to go is before 6 when margaritas are only $3 and select appetizers are $5 ea. 7 days a week The atmosphere makes you feel like you are in Mazatlan. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is one of few to serve Mexican breakfast. I ordered Huevos rancheros, the eggs were perfectly cooked the ranchero sauce was good, between the 3 tortillas were beans, peppers and onions avocado on top, served on potatoes. The pico de gallo was flavorful but not hot enough for me as I am used to Tex mex. The Coffee was quite good and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing! Tucked backed in the corner of a shopping center, this place is a must for trying out. Fresh hot chips and salsa when you sit down and strong cocktails that exceed expectations. I normally don't order chicken because beef and pork is just so good, but I went with the chicken fajitas and the flavor/ tenderness of the chicken was muy delicioso. The lady ordered the tomatillo chicken enchiladas and they have a bit of a kick but are well worth it with the flavor punch you get.  With the staff being very attentive and the food so good, we're definitely  coming back to try happy hour and breakfast."}
{"text":"Went Friday night and were the only ones in the place.  Did the Yelp check-in and found we were eligible for a free app or desert.  Unfortunately the waitress told us it doesn't apply during Happy Hour.  Not a good start.  The food was ok.  The chicken in the chicken mole was tough as though it was cooked hours ago.  The other entrees were satisfactory but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and delicious food! Get the habanero or jalapeño margaritas! They're massive and so tasty!"}
{"text":"I'm married to a Mexican who has very high expectations for his Mexican food.  This place measured up.  
We had the poerco pibil (I believe).  And, according to my husband it was just right -- not \"kill the cook\" good, but very good.  

Happy hour drink prices were great.  Also, be sure to check in on Yelp because you get some kind of discount coupon.  However happy hour prices actually beat the coupon so save it for unhappy hours. 

This place delivers but unfortunately they charge a $10 delivery fee -- so we choose to not order.  Otherwise we would be ordering all of the time."}
{"text":"love this place...the shimp dish is amazing .....we had to order another plate for the table .worth a try....you will love it."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious! I have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant since I moved to AZ from Texas &  I finally found it. Quesadilla, fajitas, queso the best I ever had. I when I crave Mexican this is where I'd go. Place is a little crowded in a tacky decor but who cares the food is good. The service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Had Chicken Mole enchiladas it was Soo good. I could taste the \"Abuelita\" chocolate they used to make it taste authentic. I will be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"We were really expecting more.  The food was marginally average.  We had breakfast and it was truly not good enough to go back again.  This is not the place to go for GOOD Mexican food."}
{"text":"We ordered the mole enchiladas and carne Asada tacos, soooo not impressed. Their salsa is green and thick. Great service, just can't pay for mediocre food."}
{"text":"This place deserves five stars for service and great Mexican food.   Rolled in  about 530 on a Tuesday night and had the place nearly to myself. Service was immediate, with a draft Modelo Negro.  Looking over the menu, I was drawn to the elote Mexicano. Beer arrived before the appetizer, but my entree, a chicharones platter came shortly.  Waitress checked on me but gave me plenty of space.  

Price was right with the happy hour beer and appetizer pricing.  It's not fancy, but it's clean, quick, very nice place to just enjoy authentic Mexican food in Scottsdale.  I'll come back here next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Mexico City, 1990-something...In a dark, music-filled, bustling restaurant where very little English is spoken. There I am, intimidated by a huge, sizzling platter of giant bacon-wrapped shrimp. I'm young. I've never seen shrimp so fierce, bacon so underdone. I eat it and I eat it again. I ate everything at that place and then we all went to the disco down the street. 

It's weird the things you remember so well and weirder still when a taste authenticity is what conjures a remote memory. There was no bacon-wrapped shrimp on the menu here but I did go for the Camarones y cactus. Eat & eat! There is the taste of the firm shrimp and smoky grill, the softness and juiciness of the cactus pieces. (Consistency like bell pepper, texture/wetness you'd expect like eating of Aloe Vera plant.) These flavors are delicate yet intense. How is that achieved? 

I don't know but it came through on the Elote on the Cob too. Maybe it's just the mayo! If only it were that easy. Quesadillas were not greasy with a bath of cheese; rather very well balanced with ingredients & sufficiently chickeny! Don't even ask me to tell you about the Oaxacan queso fundido. I've never been intimated by a plate of cheese but I had to take most of this rich and buttery dish home. The flat bread they serve this with deserves a review all its own. And next time, I'm getting the carnitas. 

Nothing is overlooked here! The chips are fresh and homemade. The owner, Maria took our order and made us our margs herself. She takes pride in her place and it seems her nephew (in the kitchen) does too. Unlike the restaurant I'd mentioned, it isn't dark in here. There is a full bar, tv, music and your basic furnishings. There's the happiest happy hour on earth...those margs I'd mentioned... $3.00! (Select cerveza on HH too.) Other specialty drinks/tequila look inviting too. 

\"Authenticity at a reasonable price in a family-owned Scottsdale restaurant.\" Is that undercooked bacon flying?!"}
{"text":"Here for Spring Training and decided to look up a good Mexican food place. This one had the highest rating. We had the Mole Enchiladas and the Chicken Tomatilla Enchiladas and neither dish disappointed. All the ingredients were fresh (I was told everything was homemade), and it tasted like it. I appreciate authentic Mexican so much more than the standard fair Mexican-American dishes found at so many Mexican restaurants. The Margaritas were excellent as well -- only $3 due to happy hour. Can't beat that! I'd recommend this place without a hesitation. Will probably return within the week, and next year should spring training beckon."}
{"text":"My food was good...average I'd say. Nothing horrible nothing fantastic, so if your close by worth trying but wouldn't go out of my way. Also the queso was thick and not tasty, prices are way to high."}
{"text":"Delicious Homemade Mexican! Margaritas are light but, potent. Service was excellent, though; it was not crowded."}
{"text":"Great food!! Friendly staff! I'll definitely come back. The carnitas were excellent, and the enchiladas."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant three times and I have had an excellent meals. This is authentic Mexican food so if you are expecting Tex Mex, street tacos, etc this is not the place. The food and the service has been excellent. I recommend the home made flan which was delicious. The only complaint I have is the last time I was there the air conditioning was not strong enough for 115 degree weather."}
{"text":"Return for lunch and we were a little disappointed. The chicken mole was okay but it is much better at Los Sombrero's. My mother ordered a beef burrito, which isn't on the menu, but what she got was mostly a rice burrito with a tiny amount of beef. The service is still very good as are the Margaritas. Don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant in south Scottsdale. Everything feels clean and new inside. The service is amazing. The service is by far 5 stars. The food is around 3 stars...so 4 stars it is!  We went at around 530 on a Sunday night and it was pretty empty. They have happy hour everyday I think. Draft beers were $3 margarita was $5. We had the shrimp appetizer and it was a little garlicky but delicious. The food we got was pretty good. I got fish tacos. The refried beans were a little bland. The rice was slightly bland as well. The rest of the food was good. It was a very good experience over and an inexpensive bill. Such great people working here!!"}
{"text":"Ok nothing to write home about. Neighborhood website & promo got me there but horrible location. Need to consider moving if wanna be relevant"}
{"text":"A little inconsistent, but yet worth going back to. 

Never too busy, but always some what active. 

Servers who can actually accurately describe the menu items and make positive recommendations. 

Clean, comfortable atmosphere. 

I have been three times now. Good. Not great, except for the value for what you pay"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for breakfast; the best huevos rancheros I have had in a long time. I could not finish, it was truly a meal for two.  It was layers of tortilla, beans, egg, potatoes, cheese and the best ranchero sauce."}
{"text":"Great food and the service is outstanding! !!
We had the Shrimp burrito, quesadillas, cochinita pibal,
And chicken mole'
Happy birthday Khyla King!!! My little earth Mama:-)."}
{"text":"Great spot!! Everything about our experience was nice so we'll definitely be back. Ask for their most popular dishes and you really can't go wrong. 

Prices are reasonable. Food is delicious. Portions are great. Not the best decor but it's a cute little spot in a strip mall so don't go in thinking upscale or chic and you won't be let down. Apparently their happy hour has some great specials so I'll be back to try them. Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I am always so happy and full when I leave this place. I love the drinks way to much and I always try something different every time I come here,thank God for this place"}
