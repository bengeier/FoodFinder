{"text":"Tonight was my first experience at the Smuggler's Inn, I had been anticipating going for awhile. Went with my kids (8 & 5) And felt ignored for the first 7-10minute  and even when the server finally did come around we had to ask multiple times for water and a pop. And even tho it wasn't busy it felt like she was too busy for us. Eventually the manager (on her own accord) came around to ask how things were. I told her that the truth was for my first time I wasn't really enjoying it. Heidi (the manger) was really, really great. She said she was sorry that it was such a bad first experience and I really appreciated that. And went on to comp our dinner which was above and beyond and very thoughtful. Because of Heidi we will back she's a great manager."}
{"text":"Smugs has been a perenial favourite since I arrived in Calgary in 1983. It is probably my favourite prime rib house and while it has seen some transitions the quality of food and service has not diminished. The simple salad bar is fresh and the Portuguese Bean and Sausage soup is awesome! Prime rib sandwich makes for an excellent lunch! There are other excellent choices too!"}
{"text":"Holy wicked steaks batman!   My search on Yelp pointed me in the direction of this gem!   It was my roomies 40th birthday last night and he wanted steak, so I searched on yelp and decided this was the best place to take him for some protein overload!   The atmosphere is interesting. The lights are turned down a bit, giving the place a 'romantic' feel. The chairs are ..... medieval ....to say the least. They are huge King-like chairs. It was a little hard to sit at the table for two since the legs for the table were in the middle, kept bashing my poor knees!   They have a salad bar which wasn't too bad, spinach and basic salad greens with an assortment of veggies and cheese to put on top. They also had various salads to choose from. The German potato salad was pretty tasty! Off to the side was a soup bar with three different types of soup, bread and butter. The salad/soup bar is included with any of the main entree dishes.   My roomie and I decided to choose from their main menu. I chose cut#2 which was a 16oz prime rib and it came with a Yorkshire pudding, mashed potatoes, gravy and brocolini. My adventurous roomie chose cut#3 which was a whopping 22 oz behemoth prime rib (it came with the same items mine did).   When it arrived, both of us gasped in awe. Thing things was at least 4 inches think, I kid you NOT! I said a little pray for all my veggie friends and dug in! The prime rib was juicy, perfectly cooked, tender and seasoned!   If you have meat eating friends and want to take them out for a wicked steak dinner, this is the place to go.   My roomie got a free Oreo cookie, mocha ice cream cake for his birthday which I thought was pretty sweet of them to include!!   The waiter was quick, knowledgeable and efficient. Overall it was a great experience and I will be back!   Thanks Yelpers for pointing me in the direction of this carnivore heaven!"}
{"text":"Still a favorite for an intimate meal, or a special occasion. Reservations definitely recommended in advance.  Salad bar is very good and comes with your meal, but don't fill up on that! Steak soup was very hearty and a rich broth. Taken with a side of fresh garlic breadsticks. There are a variety of salads there too that will appeal to just about every taste.  Bacon wrapped scallops for the starter, with a steak neptune with just the right amount of b√©arnaise sauce for the Mrs, and I enjoyed the Owner's cut of Roast beef, au jus and Yorkshire pudding for the main course.  I nearly downgraded this review further because of the pretentious waiter who couldn't be bothered to bring a proper wine list, but instead took out a hand written ratty piece of paper with only a few wines listed and prices by the glass. We also had to find him for our bill at the end of the night, and when paying he pre-selected the tip by % in hopes of a larger amount.  All in all, we will return for the food."}
{"text":"I can't help it, I love this place. My family has been going here since I was a little kid when the whole restaurant was still intact and it was like walking through a dark maze to find your table. It may be the nostalgia and the ambiance combined with the food we love that keeps us coming back years later.   Every meal comes with a salad bar that includes soup as well. I love the steak soup, it hasn't changed in ages, please keep it that way! I have had most of the offerings on the menu from the prime rib to steak to chicken, but my favorite? The ginger chicken stir fry, I know it sounds weird since this is a 'steak house', but it is what it is!   There used to be a bar in the basement (Back Street?) that we used to go to all the time that is gone now. It is too bad they have chopped the place up even more into different restaurants that take away from the real attraction being Smuggler's. This is why you should always make sure you have reservations."}
{"text":"Service staff were very friendly and knowledgable in introducing the menu and different cuts of steak and selection of wine. The steak is juicy and fresh. It comes with complimentary salad bar. I recommend for all of my friends. I love the Salmon salad."}
{"text":"Definitely a good place for dating!  Good atmosphere, decent servers, and delicious food. Went to there on Valentine's day without a reservation, of course all the tables were reserved, but the kind hostess told us we would like to be offered a table if we can finish dining before 7:30, the time we went to there was 5:40, we were pretty sure 1 hour and 40 minutes was long enough, and of course we accept her offer right away.   I ordered a seafood platter, which was expensive but luxuriant. It included shrimps, lobster tail, tuna, scallops, asparagus, and stir-fried rice. I thought it was worth 40 dollars. My boyfriend order baby pork ribs. He thought that was slightly over cooked, and the meet tasted little dry, but the rest of it was decent. we also enjoyed the salad bar, and it offers all kinds of vegetables and fruits.  After we paid the bill, the server brought me a pink rose as a gift for Valentine's day, and mint chocolate candy. I think we had a good time there, and definitely will go back and try their most famous Smuggler premium steak !!"}
{"text":"Smuggler's Inn staff know how to accommodate and please their clientele. Marco, our server, was one of the best we have had when dining out. Our party of four enjoyed two quarter chicken dinners as well as two prime rib cuts. The chicken was flavourful and you are given the choice or white or dark meat which one doesn't always get at other establishments. Smuggler's Inn chefs do their prime rib to perfection! Medium rare is spot on!  The full salad bar accompanies the entree and is one of the reasons we chose going to Smuggler's. The appealing, fresh selections at the salad bar not only provided a nice way to start our meals, but following our entrees, we went back to enjoy the fruit to finish. We didn't sample the dessert menu on this visit. I asked that the mashed potatoes be omitted from my plate and perhaps extra seasonal vegetables be added - that didn't happen, which ended up being okay, as the broccolini that was plated for all our meals was definitely undercooked and fibrous.  That was the only drawback to the experience. We were with friends we hadn't seen in a long time and we didn't feel rushed to free up a table.  Next time we visit Calgary, a trip back to Smuggler's Inn will most likely happen as well."}
{"text":"Excellent service, an the ambiance of the place is perfect.  The food is very delicious, and it isn't a long wait for it either.  I have been there when it was its busiest and still received excellent service."}
{"text":"Best Prime Rib in the city!! When I think of the perfect dinner place, this tops the list"}
{"text":"This review is for the weekend brunch buffet.  It consists of ten or so chaffing dishes with potato hash, bacon, sausage, eggs Benny, turkey, chicken, pasta, a token vegetable, and calamari (not sure if this makes a regular appearance).  This is followed up by an omelette station, then a carving station that actually had decent prime rib of various levels of doneness.  A small salad bar follows with some cheese and better quality cold cuts.  Finally, a dessert station has waffles, plus an unassuming assortment of cakes, pastries, cookies, and single serving mousses.  The quality of the food was such that I would not bring guests here (phrases such as \"ew\" and \"blach\" were uttered by better half as she inspected the eggs Benny and fowl).  BUT it will certainly stuff the pie holes for a family outing, at only $20.95 to boot including tea, coffee, juice, etc. Also of note was the excellent service we received from our waitress, something a family with kids would appreciate as we'll I'm sure."}
{"text":"Calgary landmark with a great salad bar and beef selection...never a let down over the years....famous for their prime rib but I recommend the bean and sausage soup in the salad bar and the New York Blackened if you like spicey....I always do the Mud Pie as well even though I'm not big on desserts...dark atmosphere but suits the theme....tired furniture should be update"}
{"text":"STELLAR brunch.   I know I've gone there a few times with family/friends for birthdays and Mother's Day, Father's Day, etc.   Lovely eggs Benedict, the smoked salmon just melts in your mouth. And the grilled grapefruit is perfect."}
{"text":"I love taking out-of-town visitors (good for a family gathering) to SI to boast about how amazing Alberta beef is.  Especially if you want to appreciate the flavor of the steak in its simplest form (other than a steak tartar).    I always order the Neptune for the snow crab hollandaise sauce and never forget to pick a glass of red wine to pair!   My only complaint is that the salad bar is absolutely boring, thus minus a 0.5 star.  But who wants to fill up with a boring cold pasta salad and canned pickles/beans if you can bless your taste buds with a perfectly cooked piece of steak !"}
{"text":"This is a phenomenal place! The atmosphere is so cool with an almost pirate/medieval feel. With the high chairs each table feels extremely private. We were there early and the salad bar was fresh and tasty. Highly recommend the salad and soup bar.   We ordered the burgers but this isn't a burger joint. You have to go here for the meat! Next time we will go for the prime rib or steak. Looking around at other people and their dishes, it looked phenomenal.   The best part of this restaurant was the service. Glen was very attentive and happy to do so. Smiles all around! Made the whole experience great."}
{"text":"We mostly come here for the salad bar, but the food is great too! We used to come here alot in the late 80's. The food is still top notch and we have rediscovered a really great salad bar. I do not know why we have not gone in so long, but are glad we rediscovered this Calgary classic. Except on one occasion recently the service is great, with enough attention from the server without being too friendly. In the last couple of months we have tried everything from there beef dip to steaks and chicken. All made to close to perfection.   It's no wonder that you usually need a reservation to get a seat on the weekend."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was GREAT! We happened to be there on a Sunday so we took in the prime rib special (full soup, salad, and bread bar along with your generous cut of prime rib, mashed potatoes, yorkshire pudding...plus a dessert, all for around only $30.) The service was lovely, the atmosphere is really neat, and the food was AWESOME. The banana bread pudding that was included with our dinner was (to my surprise) a HUGE portion- like really huge. It was so delicious and had a healthy scoop of ice cream with it. Usually when restaurants include dessert it's a tiny little taster- this thing was full size and soo good. We had a couple great bottles of wine, and the chairs there are like big thrones! Very comfy and on castors so pushing in and out to get up to go to the salad bar is still quiet! I cannot WAIT to go back to Smugglers, this will be a regular for every one of my visits to Calgary from now on!"}
{"text":"Well not a very good experience. Went for dinner with my father and brother anticipating an excellent prime rib meal that everyone keeps stating. Order the biggest prime rib dinner med rare times three. Well I am very disappointed. When I asked the waiter what type of beef AA or AAA and he wasn't sure. Being famous for their prime rib/steaks I expected nothing but the best, triple A. When the waiter had to go ask the chef what it was I was taken back. I told him before going back to ask, I said it was double A at best. When he came back he said your right. Very shocking and disappointed. Prime rib was tough and chewy and not very good. They did nothing to fix the issue and left very disappointed."}
{"text":"The steak soup to start was top notch.  The prime rib was delicious with huge portions.  We would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Our large party went to Smugglers for a special occasion. The Smugglers Inn was OK but overpriced for the quality of food. We waited over 45 minutes for our entree. One dinner companion's prime rib was nearly raw, everyone's potatoes were cold and the ribs unspectacular, cold, the chicken tough. The best things about our meal was our waiter who was very good, friendly and attentive; and the desserts. We each had different desserts and they were all excellent. Unfortunately the coffee was undrinkable. So all in all not the best experience especially for a special occasion."}
{"text":"No Prime Rib at Easter brunch buffet.  Prime rib listed on menu on table as well as online.  Super disappointed in this.  The server said they were out.....  How is a restaurant that has Prime Rib on the front door out on Easter Sunday.  Cook more you are a restaurant."}
{"text":"Can't believe I forgot about Smugglers! This was always a restaurant that I wanted to go to as a kid but my parents would never take me.  I've managed to go a few times since but haven't been for a few years.    I've read a few bad reviews about it lately so I decided to give it another shot.  We went without a reservation, and I thought that would be fine for a Monday, but it was pretty packed and we had to wait a few minutes.  I ended up going with the tried and true prime rib...the waiter recommended I try it done Cajun with the scallop/shrimp topper b/c it was on special that night ($7 for 2 scallop/2 big shrimp covered in bearnaise sauce).  It was freakin unbelievable! So tender and flavorful it was better then any steak I've had this year.  It comes with a free trip to soup/salad bar and I went with the Smugglers staple of Portuguese bean soup (waiter said that this soup and prime rib are the only 2 original menu items).  After it was all said and done this place is still the bomb and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to impress an out-of-towner with some prime Alberta beef.  Yes it's going to be an expensive night but this is one place where you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"My bridal party and I came here after my dress fitting. It was amazing throughout. Not a single complaint!! Everything was amazing including the food and the service! We could have done without the salad bar because all the rest of the food was 1000% better and filled us so much. My bridesmaid had ribs for 3 days after lol!!  Amazing can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Best prime rib in Calgary !  We hadn't been here in years but we went there for my birthday and we're not disappointed. Not as dark as I remember at all. Much cheaper than The Keg, mature professional servers ( Marco was great ! ) and I had mentioned in my reservation that it was my birthday and Marco brought us a large piece of delicious mud pie to share. I had said \" no singing please \" in my reservation as well, so Marco asked if I had requested no singing because I'd heard him sing !  The portions were huge and perfectly prepared . The appetizers were not too large either. We had to box most of it up - which he said was a common practice since the price was not much more to get the first mates cut ( the middle size ! ) Highly recommended - but make sure that you reserve."}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite restaurant for years. When we crave a good steak, we will come to Smuggler's inn. Even though Smuggler's Inn made some of its room to Tango and others branches, the atmosphere and the food quality remains superb. I love the soups. My steak got over cook slightly, (we all know it happens sometimes); in other hand, my father's steak is soft and juicy!"}
{"text":"Went here for my boyfriend's birthday.  Service was amazing.  Our waiter gave good recommendations for their best steaks.  We went with the medium cut prime rib, medium rare (more on the rare side), and the cajun new york steak.  Both were delicious.  The prime rib came with horseradish and the waiter asked if I wanted more of a kick...naturally, I said \"Yes\" because I love spicy goods...and he came back with a spicy horseradish for my prime rib and it was bloody delicious!    With a bottle of wine, appy, 2 delicious entrees AND their unlimited soup and salad bar, it only came to $125...not bad at all..  Our waiter even went out of his way and tried to help me set up candles for the birthday cake that I had bought for my boyfriend (said he had it all set to go but was just waiting for my bf to come back to the washroom), but we had plans to bring the cake home to eat with his family...so he packed it back up for us.  Tipped him good for sure!  Soup and Salad bar weren't anything great...but hey, it was free."}
{"text":"Hands down the best steakhouse in the city. Also still have a salad bar which is awesome. I recommend the Cajun filet. Prime rib is fantastic too. I wish they were closer to where I lived, but the trip across the city is worth it."}
{"text":"Not realizing when we we made lunch resos on a Sunday, they only offer the buffet brunch menu and we were hoping for a la carte.   Regardless, the spread is pretty decent. You've get the traditional breakfast dishes like eggs benny, sausages, bacon, waffles and then the lunch items such as their roast beef, ham, roasted veggies, seafood and salads.   For $25, you eat to your content and people seem to love it here as it was packed when we arrived at 11:30 - so make those reservations!"}
{"text":"It's not as good as before. Salad bar is mediocre with less variety. Entrees we had were cold and not tasty. Even the prime rib wasn't cooked properly."}
{"text":"Got reservations online.  Table awaited us. We celebrated our 24th wedding anniversary with a nice Shiraz and a fillet mignon for my bride and blackened prime rib for me.  The food was great as usual and the service top notch. Marco was excellent as our waiter. We will return......"}
{"text":"The waiter was fantastic, hubby really enjoyed his meal and the experience could use some updating"}
{"text":"Love this place, the prime rib steak, halibut seafood, and buffet salad bar - great value and taste and environment. They have nice salad and soup buffet. Their steak menu are great, like prime ribs."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Our server was very accommodating and professional. However, the salad bar was awful. Really. Cold grilled vegetables with dishes of other ingredients that had come from containers. Some boiled eggs. It was too dark to see all of the ingredients. The soup had a few bits of meat in it but not many. The bread tray was almost empty.Not impressed with it at all. I can get a better salad at Co-op store."}
{"text":"If I were writing this a couple years ago, it would have at least 4 stars. But my last couple experiences here have really dragged it down. I'd actually give it a 0 based on tonight's service. For starters, we were there for over 2.5 hours! I could not figure out why the two tables next to us seemed to have the same server who I did not observe serving anyone else, and we had this guy who seemed to be serving half the restaurant. He would come set something down and run away before we could ask for anything. He gave us water and said \"do you need a minute?\" I said no we're good and then he turned and walked away?! Plus when he took away dishes, he reached right into my mother in law's face across her food every time. That's got to be an inexperienced server error.  Now, for the food. We typically love the salad bar but they have changed it recently and it sucks! They got rid of the big bowls of pasta salads and replaced them with tiny plates of bland, flavorless \"salads.\" I tried this basil-barley type one and after I took a serving, the main plate was half empty. I also went to grab a pickle and a server swooped in and took them literally out from under my nose. There were still 6 left, at least left me grab one! It was downright rude. EVERYTHING needed salt. Salt only helped some things. It was mostly cold, mushy zucchini, tomatoes and other vegetables. The ranch dressing was definitely off. I normally love the steak soup (as in, I could drink it). Well tonight it was near empty so I politely asked a server if there would be more. He peers in and sneers at me \"there's at least enough for one more bowl.\" I said no thanks I will wait for a fresh batch to which he gave me a dirty look and stormed off. I was very taken aback.  Prime rib. Mine was a very generous cut and cooked well, but my poor husband got this gritty, fatty piece with a huge bone in it and the meat was raw in parts. When he politely said something to our slow server, the guy acted like he didn't believe him and was squinting down at it going \"I doubt it's raw.\" He was offered another cut but we were pretty much done eating as we had to wait forever for him to check on us. The brussel sprouts were hard as rocks and had nothing on them. Who chooses that as a vegetables anyway? It's kind of known as a less loved side dish! And the yorkshire pudding was this dry, almost burnt sad little thing. I have made better from a package at home.  We sat for 15-20 minutes to wait for an offer of a dessert menu and then another 10 for the bill, before getting up and going to the front because he was so slow. He didn't do any type of discount for the inedible prime rib, so we had to explain to the hostess about the whole awful experience and luckily at least SHE was apologetic and comped his meal. The server stood there to whole time we talked about it and didn't even apologize for the slowness. He looked irritated. I am really disappointed but seeing as this is about the 3rd time in a row w'eve gone and experienced sub-par food, I don't think this will be our main spot for prime rib. Our local Keg down the street does much better! And without the snotty attitudes. We are grateful for the nice hostess though!"}
{"text":"Smuggler's is a typical old school steak house with outdated decor and mediocre food. We went with a group of 10 and the majority tried the prime rib as the reviews state it was the best in Calgary. I agree the cut of meat and oversized portions were decent but the sides are lacking. They have a salad bar and soup station that I enjoyed more than my entree. I am going against the grain on this one and still prefer The Guild steakhouse. I can dig old school charm but need flavour, step it up."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is where we take family and friends who are visiting Calgary. The decor is very interesting: giant back chairs, wood and metal theme. It's dark so it always feels like it's night inside. The vibe is cool. The salad bar is fresh and has great quality options. I always get the half of roasted chicken and it is the best I've ever had. My husband always gets the Alberta raised prime rib -what Smugglers is known for. He loves it. The mud pie dessert is to die for and I'm not even a coffee lover.   Service is always courteous, prompt and professional. We always take the earliest reservation of the evening and get out before it starts to get busy - it always does!"}
{"text":"The food as always been top notch and good serving. Number one place for beef as you will not regret it and the steak soup omg .."}
{"text":"My companion and I enjoyed a great big Sunday brunch at Smugglers. We arrived ealy at 9:30. It is my understanding they offer it on Saturday too. Whoa! I ate too much! There was a huge variety of temptations! The fluffy waffles with berry compote was a favourite for both of us. The compote was not too sweet - perfect! The smoked fish was delicious (trout I thnk?) It looked like they had smoked salmon as well. They pretty well had any and everything one could possbly want! Aside from the waffles, I did not indulge at the great big yummy looking dessert table. I was full! The service was great. The price was reaonable."}
{"text":"Totally did not expect the decor ... medieval looking.  I was looking for knights in armor. I haven't been to a restaurant with a salad bar in quite a while and this was a killer salad bar. The soup looked great.  I had the French onion ... excellent for a salad bar setting ... loaded with carmelized onions.  Ordered the Cajun Chicken Jambolia. It was a little small but,  given I had just eaten an awesome salad and cup of soup,  it was perfect. Very spicy and cooked very well.  I would have liked a little more rice in the mix but otherwise,  excellent."}
{"text":"I have been to Smugglers many times over the years but only for lunch or dinner. Went for Sunday brunch with some friends and their kids. We had made reservations and went for the early seating, which I believe was for 10:00am.  We were promptly seated and our waiter came over right away to explain the buffet process for brunch and took our order for beverages. We were advised we could go up, which we did in turns since kids were dining with us.  The variety of food was good, but I expected to see more. They had an omelet station made to order, which I liked as well as other pre-made items out. The typical waffles, scrambled eggs, sausages, potatoes, fruit and that kind of thing. Nothing differnt, unique or out of the ordinary that stood out. The same kind of stuff you would see at any breakfast buffet. The food I did have was good and no complaints. Nothing over the moon fantastic. Price for adults is $22.95 per person and no one went up for seconds of breakfast, so it really didn't make it worthwhile for this price. Only 2 of the 5 adults went up for dessert and we shared. Dessert was fine but nothing I had to have seconds of. It was good and nothing great that stood out for me or anyone else.  As for the kids, they seemed to be the fussy ones and were hoping for pancakes which they didn't have. Most just had fruit and some scrambled eggs which is too bad since the price for kids is $1.25 x their age.  So for an 8, 11 and 12 year old it was pretty pricey since they hardly ate anything.  Would be great to see some more kid's friendly options and maybe add something to the buffet for the adults that isn't in the typical breakfast buffet. Not sure if I would go back for brunch but would defiantly go for dinner/lunch and order off the menu.  Service was good, but then again it was buffet and we only saw or waiter to take our drink order and to provide the bill. So not much service was required."}
{"text":"The food was great and the staff were friendly. The salad buffet and soup were nice but not spectacular or special. We had the halibut which was fantastic. We will definitely be returning to try the famous steaks."}
{"text":"One of the last steak houses in Calgary with a cool vintage vibe. Calgary is so lacking in any kind of restaurant that has character, so I hope this place doesn't change. The steaks are top-notch, as is the salad and soup bar. The service is always attentive and not pretentious."}
{"text":"These guys actually had a pretty diverse selection of beers, although I found most of them of the non-offensive variety.  I didn't recognize a few of the beers, and asked the waiter if they had any IPA.  He suggested Keith's.  I said, \"No.\" I opted for an English Bitter that was well-made.  Steak was good.  Twice-baker was good.  Salad bar was awesome.  Their soups were great.  Really cool atmosphere that is ship-like with lots of heavy wood.  Huge old locks by the Hostess Stand were cool as well."}
{"text":"If you come to visit Calgary, smuggler's is the best place for Alberta beef!  I've been to smuggler's like every second month and so far never had even one bad experience. Service is always friendly, food is always excellent. The most important, price is really reasonable."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food today. They served me fries that were stale and old. Probably from lunch. Then my moms lobster was also awful. We complained and they said AND I QUOTE, \"We're double checking all of our quality on our lobster and fries.\" ummmm ok. That's very nice for the future of your business but what about the fries that I didn't touch or the lobster left uneaten? Nothing was done at all. The waitress was so rude."}
{"text":"Usually an invitation to a steak house is not something I get too thrilled about since I haven't eaten beef for about 15 years, but Smuggler's has turned me into a steak house convert.  The building itself is confusing as hell because there are other restaurants within the building so it isn't readily apparent where Smuggler's actually is when you first pull in, and the whole environment is circa 1978 between the decor and old-timey salad bar, but that is where the disappointments end.  I ordered the Halibut Tarragon and it was fabulous! I received a generous portion of halibut topped with scallops and shrimp accompanied with a light orange and tarragon sauce - yum. For an extra $5 they were offering an add-on of a lobster claw so I couldn't resist. My husband ordered the medium cut if prime rib and a massive roast-sized piece of meat was delivered to him. He claimed that it was the best prime rib that he had had in many years and he had enough left over to have a second meal the next day.   The service we received was excellent and we will be happy to return soon."}
{"text":"Visiting from SF Amazing food and service  I got the 22 oz prime rib and my girlfriend got cajun jambalaya with chicken.  We also ordered 3 side dishes which were the sizziling mushrooms, whipped potato (mashed), and fries. ALL WERE ON POINT THANK YOU."}
{"text":"THE BEST THERE IS THE BEST THERE WAS AND THE BEST THERE EVER WILL BE. My number one spot in the entire city. Have been going here since I was a kid and it is just the best spot. Soup and salad bar is top notch. The prime rib is always the greatest thing I've ever eaten. Escargot is delicious. Great wine. This place is amazing for birthdays, romantic dates or if you are just craving the most delicious Alberta beef prime rib"}
{"text":"For a place that's supposed to be well-known for Prime Rib, I've had significantly better cuts from The Keg and elsewhere. I pretty much always stick to Prime Rib if I'm going to go out for beef, since it's not easy to make a serving at home for a single person (slow roasted Prime Rib is not the same as a Prime Rib steak, but they are both delicious).  I don't intend to ever return as I was thoroughly unsatisfied. Medium rare Prime Rib was medium at best -- not tender at all, no flavour and it was missing the cap (the tastiest, tenderest part of the Prime Rib). I make better Prime Rib at home, so I'm not going to spend $$$ on it here."}
{"text":"Dinner places with Salad bars are always my top pick! Great soup I loved how they had a selection of buns. The prime rib was melt in your mouth satisfying."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone on several dates at Smugglers. Always a great experience with food and staff.  But this time was awful!  We had a group of 9 and 3 of them were very unsatisfied with their meals. One of my guests told the manager Ryan about it, he told her she was wrong and all she had to do was cut into the middle of her steak and he's sure it would be fine then. He was very rude and stuck up and his customer service was the worst I've ever seen. Our waiter didn't seem to know what he was doing and we waited a long time for everything. What made our experience even worse was that they offered to discount our meals which was great...  But if they were to do that, they couldn't split up the bills. This is what the waiter told us. So my husband sent like 15mins trying to figure everything out and when he was finally done the manager comes over and says they could do it on the computer. So now we are even more angry. Then Ryan (the manager) says in front of all the guests, staff and the waiter that the waiter isn't intelligent and that he (Ryan) is the only one who is intelligent. I was shocked that a manager would talk like that about his staff in front of the whole restaurant!! My husband told him he was the most ignorant manager he has ever met. Ryan proceeded to follow my husband outside and tell him how his waiter is always fucking up. And to top it all off,  a mandatory 18% gratuity was added to our bill.  An extra $70 for bad food and service. We will never be going there again!"}
{"text":"Smugglers has been around since I first came to Calgary.   It still has the same rich steakhouse atmosphere.    For our corporate Year End Party this year we went to Smugglers.  The dinners were great, the wait staff funny and fun and gracious and helpful.   The food was good.   The Salad bar was pretty and looked very trendy.   It was fresh greens and other additions which would have been Vegan Approved, but I found the choices a bit confusing.  I wanted just a simple salad before my entr√©e and found myself trying to determine what kinds of seeds and nuts were at the end of the bar.   But The prime rib was wonderful.   I liked the idea I could substitute the veggie medley of trendy kale etc.  for a good old baked potato with all the trimmings and medium horseradish for my beef.   And a  small Yorkshire pudding.   Yes, I'd go back.  But then,  Smugglers is and always has been 'Calgary' to me, no matter how many times they change the names of the other places, it will always have the Piratical flavor to it and it will always taste like Alberta."}
{"text":"By far my favourite steak house in the city, the salad bar is awesome, the prime rib prime rib sandwich or any steaks are always done perfect, I could eat here twice a week if I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Wonderful prime rib. Fab salad bar. Excellent meal and service. Recommend for hearty appetites."}
{"text":"A classic and iconic institution in Calgary, great food great drinks and great service. They are on the expensive side for sure and they could stand to give their prices a double check. Also, they think their salad bar is \"famous\" but it's limited, wilted and limp. Let's be honest though, no one is going there for the salad. Great ownership of the guest experience by every employee from start to finish!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Not outstanding. They have real good wasabi dressing , the steak soup used to be really good. I must say though I did get very good service. Price is reasonable. I must be cynical, but I havent been blown away in a real long time. Maybe the wife is just a really good cook."}
{"text":"This Place is awesome Great I mean great steaks and a killer salad bar decor is wild sort of dark  but really rustic . the prices are good service is good  Over all this place is great had a good time with my friends will defiantly return and would highly recommend this place to any one."}
{"text":"I love Smuggler's.  The prime rib is the best in town and I love the old school soup and salad bar.  The wine list is adequate albeit a bit down market.  The waiters have been here for years and also offer great service.  My only complaint is that I wish they hadn't chopped this place up into several smaller restaurants.  We went to one of the other restaurants and didn't like it and haven't been back.  That being said we go to Smuggler's at least a couple times a year and always have a great dinner."}
{"text":"Nostalgia.  They do some big cuts of prime rib here!  22 ounces of Alberta beef goodness.  We ended up sharing a plate of it, the second person pays $8.95 for access to the salad / soup bar.  Pretty good value.  I really like the ambiance indoors - feels medieval.  Eating steak out on the patio was chilly, but we didn't have a reservation on a Saturday evening so that's where we got seated."}
{"text":"If you are hungry and want a crazy, giant, enormous brunch...go here! It's super old school inside. It looks like an old 1960's steak house with big heavy wooden chairs. But the breakfast buffet was good."}
{"text":"How did this place get so many 5 stars. Tried it 2 years ago brutal service, went last night same thing. On there worst night red water or cattle baron are still way better. Save the stupid chocolates at the end and train waiters to look at a table with empty glasses and a table with empty dished then bring main trying to figure out where to put stuff. they spent more time watching flames game than checking on customers. You want a laugh ordered stuffed potato looks like they stepped on it before they serve it to you. Should have gone to Haru"}
{"text":"Smugglers is uneven in terms of Calgary dining. Sometimes it is amazing and a huge hit for me and other times it's a miss. My most recent visit was somewhat in the middle. The SO and I headed to Smugglers for Father's Day brunch. Not because he's a father. But because we both just like brunch. Some of the fare on the buffet menu was quite good, including a Louisiana seafood bake, but there truly isn't enough non-meat fare for pure vegetarian friends. As a pescetarian, I really was okay, but vegetarians would've struggled to get their value in.  Furthermore, the desserts on the buffet weren't phenomenal, they were just alright. Overall, not a bad experience, and I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Smuggler's Inn is incredible if you want real Alberta beef.  The place is a little dark, but it helps bring the atmosphere of a steakhouse.  The waitstaff is quite good, and often asked if we need anything do not hesitate to ask.   The dining area was not too loud where you would have to shout at one another to hear, and not too quiet either that made you feel like you had to whisper.  Great for going for a casual night with friends.  If you are expecting a great salad bar, this is not the place to go. But then, why would you go to a steakhouse and fill up on salad?  It is a good small filler if you are ravenous and cannot wait for your food to come.  The steak was wonderful.  I had the prime rib, and it was perfectly seasoned.  I have been to many other steakhouses where the steaks are over salted, not allowing the true taste of the beef come through.  My husband had a great New York Strip.  Whoever aged the beef did a fantastic job.  If i lived in Calgary again, this would be a place I would come back to over and over again."}
{"text":"Wow to the salad bar and soup! There are so many delicious choices and sour vege selections to accompany my mountain of BBQ beef ribs which was ginger licking good! The sausage soup was a nicely balanced light spicy sweet. My friends who had the steak soup did comment that it was on the saltier side. Overall, great food for the price we paid. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Since it was my birthday and I was in need of a prime rib fix, my wife and friends took me to Smuggler's Inn. I was impressed by how good the service was, because the place was packed, but our waiter's service was excellent. The prime rib could be cut with a fork and was delicious. The soups and salad available from the salad bar were also delicious, but you really have to watch that you do not indulge in them to much due to the large portion of prime rib that you get even if you order the smallest cut. Simply put, if you enjoy a prime rib or steak Smuggler's is one of Calgary's gems."}
{"text":"Oh Smuggler's how I miss thee.  Your ambiance is dark and sexy and you really spice things up with that wasabi salad dressing.   Easily the best prime rib in Calgary in my opinion.  Your meat is always cooked to perfection, not that you should order anything other than medium-rare anyways, and you're always left satisfied.  The staff are great and always on the ball.  This is a great place for a hot date or a birthday with friends.  Don't forget your old padlocks so your meal will be free."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Smugglers. They have a really good salad bar that I would probably just eat stand alone, but their meals are good as well. You just can't beat the ambience. Old school for sure! And the place is a maze - there are so many different areas to dine including the lounge area. If you haven't tried it before, you should."}
{"text":"They have set the bar pretty high.  The restaurant has that warm, aged feel where the chairs make you feel like you're a knight at the round table and your waiter makes you feel like an honoured guest (Guy, if you're reading this, you are a great server!!!).  They have a kids menu, but ask, because it isn't printed.  I would suggest that you call ahead or use Open Table to book if you have kids.  SI was great, when we showed up with 2 kids under 7, they discreetly put us in a corner of the restaurant, which put us at ease.  We are still talking about the salad bar.  For your money, this place is definitely a must see.  Being from YVR where a good steak dinner for 4 might cost you the same as your entire hotel bill, it was a pleasant surprise to get a bill where a superb steak dinner was completely affordable.  Had my husband had his way, we would have eaten here every single night.  Thank you Smuggler's Inn!"}
{"text":"I recall really liking Smugglers for brunch, and loving Tango for all meals. However, this time, the Smugglers/Tango brunch was... meh. It wasn't terrible, but some dishes were cold or not super. The dessert table was excellent, but you know, it's breakfast, so the amount of dessert permissible is debatable (apparently). The omelette station was nice.  Overall, brunch was ok... but for $23, I expect better. Definitely go to Tango for lunch or dinner, though!"}
{"text":"Food Quality: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Parking: 5/5 Kitchen Speed: 4/5 Value: 4/5  Quality is on the menu here. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"I had come here 2 years ago and for some reason it was awful! So I had refused to come back but since I had visitors, I felt like I had to bring them to have some Alberta beef and so I thought I'd give Smugglers another chance and it was pretty good. Service was good.  We came on a thurs night. Perhaps since it was a less busy night that they were able to execute well? dunno but we had a good dinner."}
{"text":"Found this fantastic restaurant 14 years ago . . . returned this year, 2014, and the quality is still superb.   You will also find value for your dollar.  Under same ownership, salad & soup bar a real gem. Ordered the large cut prime rib - enough for two people.   The rib-eye steak was not quite as tender.  Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"My sister and her fianc√© have been raving about their prime rib and had a $10 birthday coupon so when my older brother was in town we decided to try Smugglers.  I also creeped photos of the food many times and I was happy to finally try Smugglers.  Located on Macleod Trail SW and in the same complex as Tango, they have their own parking lot.  If that's full you'll have to find parking on the street somewhere and walk a bit.  My sister could only get a reservation for 8:15PM but we were fine with it because we had things to do beforehand.  We arrived on time and got seated right away.  I found the environment to be very...old school, country with a bit of a pirately vibe...haha maybe it's the name?  The lights were quite dim but it was alright.  I read about the salad bar so I was excited about that.  As we were looking at the menus, some dishes came by which looked delicious.  There were 5 of us total, 3 went with the smugglers inn cut for prime rib, I went with the prime rib sandwich, and my younger brother went with the lamb.  All of our meals came with the soup and salad bar.  Our waiter gave waters and ice tea as requested and took our order.  After, he pointed to where the soup/salad bar and we walked around the corner to grab some food.  There was a nice selection of salads: greens, pasta, noodle and waldorf salads with many different dresses and fixings as well as some fruit and jello in the salad bar.  There were 3 soups available that night: steak soup, some bean soup and another one that I had forgotten about and some bread and butter.  We put some croutons in an empty bowl and filled it up with soup.  The steak soup didn't have any pieces of steak in but it was tasty, almost like a tomatoy thick soup, salty as expected.  We then went for some salad, my older brother made himself a beet salad because he loves beets and the rest of us got a little bit of everything.  I grabbed a soup bowl and filled it with jello : ) hehe   Shortly after we finished our salads, the mains came out.  My brothers lamb looked delicious, 3 generously sized pieces of lamb, side of beans and a half tomato.  I've never been a fan of lamb but I wanted to have a taste...he really enjoyed it but it's just not my thing, I find it gamey and I don't think it tastes all that great but that's just me and lamb.  Both my other brother and Kenny got a piece of prime rib with a bone in them, my sister got a normal piece without bone and my prime rib sandwich looked just as good as the smugglers cut just a little smaller.  Each of the smugglers cuts came with yorkshire pudding, beans and half tomato and my 'sandwich' came with a piece of garlic bread,  yorkshire pudding and mashed potatoes.  I tasted a piece of my rib with some horseradish and it was juicy but tough.  I thought it was just mine because I had the sandwich but my sister gave me a taste of her and it tasted the exact same, juicy but tough.  I wasn't overly satisfied with the prime rib, maybe because my sister and Kenny hyped it up but they weren't happy either.  They said it was tougher than normal and just wasn't the time as their previous visits.  I did say that it was later in the night so maybe it's the scraps of the last batch but it shouldn't be that tough.  Although not the best, it was edible but, there were a lot of fatty pieces.  The horseradish was perfect, not too nostril burning, it did help with the eating the prime rib.  Overall, my first experience at Smugglers was not as enjoyable as I pictured.  I had high expectations from word of mouth and reading reviews but it just didn't measure up.  Over waiter was great though, attentive and cracking small jokes here and there.  We did ask to see the neat dessert menu which is pretty neat.  We left, full but not completely satisfied.  Hopefully if I visit again, I will go earlier in the day."}
{"text":"This is our favorite stakehouse in Calgary, or almost anywhere for that matter. We were a bit disappointed on our last visit with the \"leftover\" soup, our reservation was nearing closing time(10pm, our reservation was for 9pm) but I felt like we still should have been able to have more than the bottom of the soup pots with little to no meat left in either of their soup choices that were supposed to contain meat. Still their food is very good, especially their prime rib and I was still able to get it rare even at that late hour so I applaud them for that. Desserts are really tasty but it's hard to find room for them when you are so full from their generous portions and of course the soup and salad bar. I love the olden time decore and the big comfy chairs, hope they always keep things with the same Old English ale house kind of theme."}
{"text":"Amazing experience, took my mama who's visiting. We didn't have a reservation and showed up 8:30pm on a Friday night.  The place was pretty busy but they had room for us.  Both my mum and I are gluten free, they were able to accommodate us no problem.  Salad bar and soup was amazing, steak was the best I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"There's no doubt that service is good and should someone be celebrating a birthday, definitely let the staff know because they are kind enough to provide a massive serving of their Mud Pie, which is fantastic.  I appreciate that they don't put on a lame or embarrassing birthday show for everyone to see.    For me, the rest of the food is just okay, with the exception of the bean and sausage soup, which is spicy, filling and hits the spot on a cold day.  The salad bar isn't anything to write home about and the main course I ordered tonight, being the Cedar glazed salmon, was not very flavorful and in fact seemed overly buttery.  I do enjoy the fireplaces, big chairs and the food highlights I mentioned, but it's not enough for me to make a point of going back.  I've only been here as often as I have because someone else made the reservation and it will continue to be that way.  Sorry, Smugglers!  At the very least, an upgrade to the salad bar would make visits more enticing."}
{"text":"Family dinner of 24 and couldn't have been happier with the service. They really looked after our group including 4 little ones. Food was great but my only complaint was the salad bar seemed a little old."}
{"text":"It's always hit and miss here.  The food was good as usual, maybe slightly overcooked but acceptable.  I always enjoy the salad bar too... Service was kinda shallow.  Poor refilling of water.  Had some ribeye boxed up to go, but when we got the doggiebag at home, I got the wrong box... Looked like fillet instead of ribeye."}
{"text":"(Forgive me Marlon, for trying to copy your Don Correlone shtick) Smuggler's.... Smugglers'.... what have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, this dry and brittle chicken breast would have been eaten this very day. And if by some chance the salad bar would have been a bit more modern,  that would become my salad bar. And then, they would be devoured for you.   Smuggler's was literally the VERY first restaurant I step foot in (besides a fast food) when I moved to Calgary.  I was looking for a classic old place, much like some of the places I used to go to in Montreal like Le Biftheque, the Rib & Reef, and the long departed La Dillegance.  A rustic looking place, with steak as the focus, and taste and quality as the battle cry.  Hearing about Smuggler's from my Aunt, this was the place to start.  She wasn't wrong.  The Prime Rib was absolutely wonderful.  The all you can eat salad bar, long a standard of the old fashioned steak houses, was a bit dated, but still a great addition.  Add the unique steak soup, the sourdough buns and superb baked potatoes, and I quickly came to look forward to the special occasion for me to run here.  That has continued every few months for 9 years, until my last visit.  My companion had chosen a chicken breast dish, while I stuck to the prime rib.  THe Prime Rib was still wonderful, though a LOT fattier than usual.  But the chicken was dry and the rest of the food was ok, but nothing spectacular.    I'm wondering if this was an off night, but I've noticed that each visit seems to be based on the Law of Declining averages.  I honestly haven't enjoyed the meals as much as the last, and the service was ok, something they've always been strong at.  I'll be back as I love the Prime Rib, but as my companion can't eat beef or lamb at all, it kinda limits my opportunities to visit and disappoints me to no end.  Still, if beef is the goal, then this is still a good place to go to!  PS: I know the goal of the subdued lighting is to create a romantic or intimate setting.  But to have it so low that I have a little trouble reading, and I have 30/20 vision (fighter jet pilot level!!!).  After a few minutes, it's not so much romantic or intimate as more spooky and even scary a little.  Really wouldn't hurt to put in some better lights."}
{"text":"As a native Calgarian I can't say enough about this place. It's fantastic. The prime rib is the best in the city and the steak soup is so addictive I have had it for dessert. The service is that of a fine dining establishment, but it does not have the restrictions that tend to go with. No jacket, no tie, no problem. Now I'm not saying that it could be seen as low rent, not at all. You can show up to dine dressed in your finest or you can show up dressed in your finest jeans and T-shirt. Either way you will receive the same impeccable food and service. The wine list is extensive and well rounded, while the decor may well be a bit dated when you see the est. 1973 on the menu I find it quite comforting that it feels like the immovable rock in a city that seems to always want to shed it's past."}
{"text":"We are from toronto and Its our first time coming here and I love it! Good price for quality food. I don't understand why yelp has only got 3.5 stars. Anyway.  Please try the rib eye (smugglers cut). It's so good with medium rare. They cooked the beef perfectly and goes with with the reddish. They have house special reddish too But it's a bit strong for me.  I also ordered bison to share. It goes very well with the blueberry sauce. It's so juicy that the bison flavor is well preserved inside the meat.  We got $13 per person for salad bar. They have many kinds of appetizer. I like the seafood chowder soup. They have so much ingredients. The steak soup is a bit too salty for me tho.  Overall, It's good!! Absolutely gorgeous. Definitely come back if I visit Calgary again"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with the boyfriend and it was really good. Loved the salad bar I made mine quite interesting lol! Ordered the cheese bread and scallops to start, bread was average but the scallops were big and double wrapped in bacon and fabulous. We had a couple of strip steaks and they were juicy and well seasoned. Our waitress was pleasant and helpful. Only complaint is seating, the seats are so big it seemed to be in the waiters way which seemed like they were gonna walk into me constantly."}
{"text":"Best prime rib and salad bar in Calgary. Definitely recommend to anyone.  10 times better than The Keg."}
{"text":"A favourite of my boyfriend  and I, the price tag means this is a place we only visit on special occasions - but well worth every penny.  The food is absolutely delicious. I've had chicken and ribs, steak and prime rib within my various visits here and each was well seasoned and juicy. Portions are so ample I often neglect it, but the soup and salad bar can be a meal in itself. VeggIes are fresh and crispy, bread is soft and doesn't taste like premade frozen dough.    Service is exceptional, attention is paid to the small details like timing your meal so everything gets to the table piping hot. They even offer to bring the debit machine to the table, which is much appreciated when in the throes of a food coma. The fireplaces and dim lights give a great ambiance well suited for date night."}
{"text":"Not my dig. Yes you get a lot of food, but I feel like what you get taste wise still does not justify the prices. I feel that the decor is a bit tacky and like you could fit more people comfortably in chairs half the size. I've been here twice, the first time was with my spouse. I ordered the prime rib which I found to be fit for Neanderthal consumption considering the size of it on a plate that's too small. It was totally bland, tasteless and chewy. I was actually pretty disappointed with it considering the boasting, and spent most of supper poking at it. (Just a tip, hands down, most flavorful prime rib EVER in calgary? CHOP restaurant over by Chinook mall. That piece of meat melts in your mouth and the flavor is out of this world.)  I will say the steak soup in the buffet at this particular restaurant is totally addicting and delicious. That's about it. I find most other items on the salad bar weird and inedible.  For our second visit; we went due to a large birthday party being hosted by friends of ours. Rembering my previous experience, I stayed far away from any beef selections (which consumes the majority of the menu.) And settled on chicken stir fry. It was fine, but nothing that I couldn't make at home for cheaper."}
{"text":"Last night we thoroughly enjoyed the prime rib. Last time we were here was in 1984 & we remembered how great the food was. We weren't disappointed!  Love the atmosphere with the big wooden chairs covered with red velvet. Remembered how Dustin & Tammy were in awe. Wonderful fresh salad bar with a multitude of choices including oven roasted tomatoes, zucchini, fresh hot pita bread triangles. They offer several different soups also, but we had to leave room for the beef!  Great service and fantastic atmosphere. Can't wait to come back again, love Calgary!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I've never reviewed this place before, I've been here several times  over the last 15 some odd years and have found the food to always be pretty much on par every time. Of course my main reason for going would be for their pride and joy, the prime rib.   The restaurant itself has been there forever, there's been a fire, they rented out space to other restaurants, but the fact remains that it's still a Calgary institution, even though it needs an obvious reno /facelift,  they do one thing right and that's the prime rib. Do yourself a favor and get the prime rib. If you go to this restaurant and do not get the prime rib, let me just say you're missing out on one of the best prime rib's served in Calgary.    They offer a salad bar which is lovely, I've never had issue with the fresh offerings served, but I do always wander to that back bar where the fresh breadsticks are as they do taunt to me every time, damn you delicious carbs! They also offer soup as part of the salad buffet, but I usually steer clear to save room for the main.  They offer several main choices from fish to chicken and of course their beef offerings which are AAA quality, the richest creamiest mashed potatoes and crispy charred seasonal veg are served alongside this holy hunk of meat but I usually I ask for a double veg portion and steer clear of the potatoes just to make myself feel like I'm eating healthier- I'm pathetic, I know.  The only reason they lose a star is because of their creme br√ªl√©e, it's too eggy and they add coconut flakes to it.  I ordered it thinking it would be made with coconut milk, but instead it was a thick, chunky, eggy concoction that would be considered an abomination to what a true creme br√ªl√©e is supposed to be. Let me say that the portion was huge! Easily enough for two people but it just wasn't right.   The waitress was great and apologized (and agreed with me that coconut flakes have no place in this custard desert) she removed it from our bill and even offered a replacement dessert. I kindly declined as it was getting late and I literally could not move anymore.   I will always return for the prime rib alone, it was magnificent! Thank you smugglers for doing meat right."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, prime rib was cooked perfectly, fries were almost too good and the best part was our waiter was timely and respectful. The only reason I didn't give 4 stars was their salad bar. Although I love the concept, it lacked in items and flavor. The ranch sauce was actually spicy. Which threw me off guard. Aside from that I loved the dinner!"}
{"text":"\"How long are you going to stay?\"  That's not really a question one enjoys hearing while dropping in - but I've just parked my car in a rather tight spot, was tired after a long day in the office, and plain hungry.  \"Should be done in about 40 minutes\"  \"Ok, there's a table booked at seven, you can seat there\"  Now, let me put it clear - I wasn't wearing sweatpants and hoodie at the time. Normal office attire, reasonably fresh haircut, Swiss watch, golden ring, polite smile... What prompted a \"you are not welcome here\" attitude right from the door - no idea.  But anyway, like I said - hungry I was. So I've been seated, got my wine, and checked out the salad bar. Salads and snacks were ok, though bread was not quite fresh, variety was not there, and butter was supplied in plastic little packs. Luxury, eh?  Steak was really well prepared, though - very professional! My waitress was also extremely polite, and people around - just normal middle-class folks. Overall atmosphere was rather comfortable, though not particularly cozy.  Well, I killed these sixty bucks and drove away - not really disgusted, as I obviously ignore this sort of treatment, but definitely leaving a little checkmark in my memory, saying \"next time look elsewhere\".  Other than that unfortunate experience, Smugglers Inn looked like an okay place, a bit on the pricey side, but not really bad. So you may wish to give it a try - who knows, maybe they'd be more polite if you book in advance?"}
