{"text":"We ordered the butter chicken, fish curry and chicken chettinad and must say it was yumm..really enjoyed it. Planning to  buy goat briyani next time"}
{"text":"Hot and spicey and the owner there gives a lot of BS. Keep a lot of water when you pick anything from here."}
{"text":"This place needs to have expiration dates and prices printed on the food. You have no idea how long anything has been sitting there. The 15 dollar CC minimum is ridiculous. A light eater is forced to pay cash or buy two items or more to get to the limit. Talk about upselling."}
{"text":"This places needs to have expiry date set on the stale food they serve customers. Although the food at times has been good, the last order was horrible. In lines with one of the reviews below, they hold on to stale food for long and don't even realize that it is bad.   The owner (when he is present) is very interactive but the rest others who work in his absence are dud. Not going to repeat it in a long time."}
{"text":"Best South Indian food in town. I don't say that lightly. The owner is so nice and so friendly. The food is all natural and everything is made in shop. You can genuinely taste the difference between this food and all the others."}
{"text":"The best homely food I have ever had. Ever. Everything we ordered was fresh and yummy.. just the right amount of spices. So homely! Would love to come back again'"}
{"text":"Really good homely cooked food. Being single I am a regular  there. 9 times out of 10 quality and quantity had been to notch.  And occasional times is still 80-90%.  All in all good place.  Just one thought. Under $15 is cash only. You guys should take credit card for over $5 without extra fees. Being single, everytime my bills is $9 - $11."}
{"text":"I've been boycotting the cafeteria at work (because it's overpriced crap), but today I caved when a co-worker introduced me to Chennai Delicacy. Apparently every Thursday they come into my work with an entree that is freaking delicious! Forgive me for not knowing what I ate, but I will try my best to describe it to you. For $7 I got a huge portion of spicy yellow basmati rice with chicken and cauliflower in it, this thin broth like sauce with chunks of chicken in it, and some fresh diced cucumbers and tomatoes in a milky sauce. The latter was cool and refreshing which matched perfectly with the spiciness of the rice and chicken. Literally so much good food that I want to crawl under my desk and take a nice nap. The guy serving it was really nice too!  I will definitely stop by again on a Thursday to see what they have to offer! If they could  bring in some South-Indian flatbread with the entrees I'd give then 5 stars."}
{"text":"The best Goat biriyani I ate in a food joint - bar none! It's not your typical restaurant experience. The owner sells packed lunches and dinners and he will heat up one for you if you want to eat one right at his place which has 2 tables and a white couch (why?!) I ate my food at his place as I was visiting Cleveland for work and it was as fresh as it can be. Good conversation with the owner, he described his food making process which was informative and felt credible so I'm not inclined to believe those expired food stories in other reviews. Will visit this place every chance I get. Next time I'm even planning to take some food back home to NoVA. Will come back and update if the experience is any different for food taken home."}
{"text":"Great price for the amount of food!  Bummer was no naan, halwah, or mutter paneer.  But, it made me eat out of my norm and was great!  Spicier than I'm used to but enjoyed it!  Samosas were great and had okra in them which was a nice change.  Veg biryani was delicious also!  My dad had chicken and said it was exceptional.  All fresh, non-gmo and gluten free.  Loved!  Will go again!"}
{"text":"These guys used to come to my workplace occasionally so I had an idea of what they serve. I have tried many items from them and pepper chicken remains my favorite. It is spicy as per Indian standards and goes well as a starter. I usually pair it as a side dish with biryani. The owner is friendly and can provide you the details about the food you have ordered. Their samosas are good too."}
{"text":"Best chicken/goat biriyani in town. I would also recommend the fish curry,chettinad chicken and amazing egg puffs."}
{"text":"Chennai Delicacy has a retail store, but it is for large portion to-go only.  It is all freshly made the night before and is very authentic and that means very spicy.  If you give them a day's notice you can get the heat down.  As they do catering to businesses and parties, their hours are not standard and they don't have a menu u can order from.  They cater once/week to my work and it is always delicious.  My family all are big fans of spicy, authentic Indian food and love Chennnai, but southern Indian food is very hot and the standard heat is too hot even for my spice lovers.  The owner is very pleasant and I wish they'd open a real retail location with a lunch buffet."}
{"text":"My brother told me about Chennai Delicacy a couple months ago while we were discussing his favorite vegan places. When he said it is also his favorite Indian place in the Cleveland area, I immediately bookmarked on Yelp.   The owner is a cheerful and helpful guy. He worked as an engineer and his wife as a doctor prior to opening the place. I am glad that they followed their passion for food and now serve up fine South Indian cuisine. Their scientific and mathematical precision are evident in the dishes. Everything is made fresh and in house. Not every Indian restaurant in the area can boast this. They also cater to a few of the local hospitals including the Cleveland Clinic and Metro.  Sometimes there are language and culture barriers for vegan customers at ethnic restaurants. This is not the case at Chennai Delicacy. I went to Chennai for lunch today with my friend and wife. The staff was very accommodating to Liz and her vegan dietary restrictions. All of the meat is halal for any of the carnivorous members of the Muslim faith.   There is a small table to eat at in the store although the food is prepared in to-go containers. They will gladly heat up a meal if you wish to eat inside. There is a $15 credit cart minimum. The portions are generous and can be stretched out to multiple meals. My favorites thus far have been the chicken biryani and guntur chicken. The guntur chicken has an excellent dry spice rub. I plan on having a few beers out on the town tonight and coming back home to this as a nightcap."}
