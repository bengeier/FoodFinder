{"text":"Why is this place still in business?   Only reason is because its the only Greek sit down restaurant around and looks good from far. Durham has really crappy greek food. They dont need good food simply because there is no competition. Vegetables are the noname frozen garbage and they are not even seasoned. People who tell you they like this place have never tasted good greek food."}
{"text":"Been coming here for about 10 years. It's simple, no fuss, quick food that is cooked properly. Any time I have had to eat at a Mr. or Friendly Greeks, I always wished I was at Milos instead. It's the perfect place when you host a dinner for a group of friends/fam (10-40 ppl) Service will be quick and menu choices appeal to everyone's tastes. I think some of these reviews are for other restaurants..since they mention things that don't exist at this here."}
{"text":"Milo's has become one of my favorite Greek restaurants! 

I've been here several times and each visit was superb. The restaurant has a Santorini island vibe in and out and it's pretty cozy and spacious inside with lots of Greek decor and tall windows brining in tons of sunshine.

The staff here is friendly and provide great service. The menu has a wide variety of yummy options. They offer appetizers, salads, soups, burgers/sandwiches, mediterranean dips, souvlaki, gyro, seafood, chicken and lamb dinners. They also have mediterranean pastas, platters, vegetarian dishes, a nice selection of side orders, desserts/drinks and more.

The food here is fresh, hot and cooked to perfection. The potions are pretty generous and the prices are very reasonable. My favorites have to be grilled octopus appetizer ($12.95) - tender and juicy, the vegetarian souvlaki dinner ($11.95)- grilled veggies serve with rice and potatoes that burst with flavor and a Greek salad. I'm also addicted to their grilled calamari dinner ($15.95) - perfectly cooked squid marinated in fresh herbs.

I always like to drown my dinner with their sweet and flakey baklava ($3.50) and Greek coffee ($2.50).

Overall, Milo's is a great Greek restaurant with friendly and efficient staff, delicious Greek food and reasonable prices. They also have free parking and an outdoor patio during the summer time. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my grandpa's birthday. The food was decent, nothing special. The garlic bread had no garlic on it and barely any butter. The waiter was a bit creepy. Got too in your face and was very shaky. We almost wore our food. Needless to say I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Not the best, but not the worst. I've ordered a couple things I will never order again most notably the lamb ( dry ..dry...dry)... but it wasn't inedible. I would never take a greek friend here, I'd be embarrassed...but when I'm hungry for something kinda greek-ish I'll go here."}
{"text":"From someone that has grown up on the Danforth and me being Greek I think I should know Greek food. I went there yesterday with my girlfriend and I ordered the typical Pork souvlaki dinner and she had the Calamari dinner.  In one work I would describe the food as \"\"Excellent\"\" This food is comparable to the best Greek restaurants on the Danforth. Our waitress was friendly and got our food quickly.  I'm not sure why this place got so many bad reviews; the only thing I can think of is the people that are writing these bad reviews don't know anything about Greek food.   Order the typical Greek food and not burgers or pasta and you'll be fine going back there over and over again eating authentic Greek food..  I know I will."}
{"text":"WORST Greek restaurant in the GTA.

Since when is a toasted hot dog bun acceptable with your greek salad appetizer? This should have been the first warning that the main course would be equally appalling... 

No apology and no discount offered. It's clear that the management of this establishment has no love for food or their customers.

 Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"ya not a great place to eat

value for money not good

the dinning room is like a cafeteria 

food is not so good i have only had worse Greek food once

service a bit surly

i think this place stays open because of lack of competition

step up your game people"}
{"text":"Where to begin really? You're greeted by a scowling hostess when you come in and treated as if you're the last person she wanted to see that day. You're then shown to your seat, a sunbleached plastic booth with a stained table. 
After some room temperature water, if you're lucky, someone might come and take your order. No mention of specials, no recommendations, just a notepad and monosyllabic responses.

It's at this point that you look around and think that this place really reminds you of modern day Greece. A lot of unhappy people skulking around like they've lost everything.

Your food comes. Surely, you think, there must be some redeeming factor to this place; there must be some reason it's still open. Obviously the food must be the saving grace. 
No.

You are given a dried out, and well over seasoned piece of lamb, drowning in tzatziki, and sparingly garnished with a few shreds of lettuce. Roll all that up in some undercooked dough, and there's your recipe for disappointment.
Let them know it's not very good, I dare you.
Then you get to meet Mr. Jimmy. 
A thoroughly unpleasant man who accuses you of not knowing what you're talking about when it comes to his cuisine and you're definitely in the wrong because 'everyone' LOVES this particular dish. 

You are offered a substitution for an equally disappointing alternate. A hamburger! Because at this point, Mr. Jimmy has lost all respect for you as a paying customer.
At this point, your server has fully abandoned you, likely at the request of Mr. Jimmy, as you can hear him in the kitchen or in his office speaking in a different language to his staff. 

Your check comes with BOTH items listed. The burger and the lamb horror show. 
Again, nobody will come to verify everything is in order. Nobody will come to even take your money. You have to physically chase down your server to dispute the bill, at which point you are re-introduced to, guess who?

Mr. Jimmy begrudgingly takes the item you did not eat off the bill, all the while acting like you are stealing money directly from his pocket. After you have paid (debit is down, surprise) you are then allowed to leave, and not a moment too soon.

Avoid avoid avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times over the past years. I'm obsessed with their Chicken Greek salads. Don't know what it is about it, but it's just delicious. 
The rest of the meals I've tried,  like souvlaki dinners, are just decent... I've had better Greek food for sure, but I've also had much worse... 

The biggest downfall to this place though is the service... Not friendly AT all...boarder line rude..... So I usually just order take out lol"}
{"text":"This is pretty much the only Greek place anywhere close to us anymore, so we are kind of stuck with it.  I would have given a 2 1/2 but you can't do that.  They are never busy which is good, but I guess the food is why, as it is just meh, nothing special.  They give you decent portions but there just isn't anything exciting about the food.  The salad is what you expect and OK, the bread could use more garlic and butter, the rice is just rice, the potatoes are OK, and the pork souvlaki is OK.  Not great but not bad, just average.  My husband has gotten the moussaka and says it isn't that good and he wouldn't get it again, same for the gyros.  I miss the place we used to go (now changed ownership and down the tubes) since this is a poor substitute."}
{"text":"Good Greek restaurant in Pickering. Has a lot of flavor and portions are huge. Nothing spectacular but very tasty"}
{"text":"Let's start with the bread, it wasn't \"yummy\".  Sure it was soft and fresh but not as tasty in the way that I usually can't stop eating it from the 'other' mainstream Greek establishment around town.  Now the 'Greek salad', it simply was 'not good' (my wife is the expert), but to me it didn't even LOOK as good as the picture on the menu.  She has had a better Greek salad at a 'hockey' pub downtown near the ACC.  Now you know the 'orange potatoes' you can get as a side (I call them orange anyway), well these ones barely had an orange tint to them and consistent with that, barely the flavor that goes with it.  They just tasted like boiled potatoes.  Everything else on the entr√©e was \"okay\".  Finally, the baklava (I insisted my wife try it thinking she had never had it before).  Turns out she has (only not knowing the name of it), and after one bite she said \"it tastes OLD\".  Now I can't explain what tasting old means, but after trying a bite myself, I had to agree - it tasted \"old\".  Kind of like stale except that baklava is a bit of a gooey mess so stale doesn't quite fit precisely.

I was going to give it three stars but the caption provided with two stars is more accurate - \"Meh. I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Love going to this place for Greek food. Prices are reasonable and staff is really friendly. They have a big selection on their menu."}
{"text":"Love the Mousakka here. It was creamy and soft, generous portion given. The salad I got with the meal was light and crispy as well. 

The Spinach/Artichoke dip appetizer was one of the best myself and my parents ever had which was surprising. Usually they all resemble every other restaurants.

 Make sure you have the Caramel Crunch for dessert too, that was a win ending to my dinner. 

The staff are very friendly/attentive and the restaurant is clean. Definitely will be going back soon."}
{"text":"I picked up some take out food from here.  I must say i like the way the take out is a separate door from the main dining room.  The food was decent as far as greek food goes, enjoyable for sure.  However the person who served me seemed almost uninterested and detached from the entire experience, almost robotic in fact.  Anyway, i ordered the regular size chicken souvlaki dinner.  One kebab, rice, potatoes, bread, and a salad for $15.  I must admit i was certainly full when i was done, in fact i couldn't finish it all.  So the portion was certainly good the price was about average i suppose, and the service could use some polish but at the end of it all, i was satisfied."}
{"text":"Very good Greek food, with a great atmosphere and d√©cor. Service however always seems to be a mess - the owner (I assume) needs to step down and hire proper wait staff. He's hard of hearing and the wrong dishes anyways end up coming to the table. He also doesn't appear to be very friendly, however the food itself is authentic and tasty with huge portions. Great prices on the lunch menu as well."}
{"text":"To sum our lunch here was disappointing 

My wife really likes Greek food so when we were looking for a place near Pickering Town Centre this place popped up.  

We sat down and for lunch time there were only 5 other guests.  As we ordered the guy beside us had just been served and he inhaled his meal.  

My spouse orders the chicken with salad and potatoes.  I had the Caesar and the daughter had the pork skewer with potatoes.  The salads both of them were pretty plain.  A lot of romain lettuce with a light topping of feta on my wife's along with one slice of tomato cut in half.   The potatoes were cut way to thick and were pretty bland. 

With my Caesar I asked for bacon bits.  What I got was a whole head or romain with 16 croutons and simulated bacon bits.  But I thought something was missing.  Our appetiser.  So half way through the main it arrives.  

The meal was pretty poor."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. Service is always prompt. Staff are friendly. Food was fast. Parking is free. The grilled calamari was excellent. Their tiziki sauce is amazing! I'd go back just for the grilled calamari with tiziki. Nice lean protein. We ordered 3 appetizers. We split the gyro appetizer and I couldn't believe how big it was. We took half of it home. 3 apps & coke came to under $40 with tax."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this restaurant nor the food they serve. The Greek salad that came with the entrees, the garlic bread and the calamari were decent. The rest  were just disappointing: only one skewer of chicken souvlaki came with  the dinner plate, the moussaka was the most bland I've ever tasted anywhere and in fact was not eaten at all, the steamed veggies were the frozen kind and so flavourless,  and the potatoes, c'mon , we can make more flavourful ones at home. Season your food guys, taste them before you serve them! No amount of flaming plates or OPA's will make me return to this place ..."}
{"text":"Our server was friendly, but the food was mediocre at best. The starter bread was a toasted hamburger bun (literally) with lots of butter slathered on it. Next came our salads, a.k.a our lettuce. There was barely any dressing on our salads and it was so dry to eat.

Lastly, our main meals arrived. I ordered the regular chicken souvlaki. It came with potatoes and rice. The potatoes were good - the best part of the entire meal. However, everything else was rather bland tasting. Also, the little tubs of tzatziki definitely weren't enough. I'd hate to say it, but you would probably get a better meal if you went to a fast food Greek restaurant instead. 

We were celebrating a birthday and also ordered desserts. The desserts were all store-bought cakes (the waiter confirmed this), so they were absolutely nothing special either. The waiter said they used to make their own desserts in-house, but not anymore. 

I will say that they were very accommodating for our last-minute party of 12. They weren't busy when we arrived (on a Sunday evening), but I still appreciate that they put together tables for us without a reservation. It's just too bad the food wasn't very flavourful."}
{"text":"Omg.. 
 Daughter order a salad dinner it was the same as my side salad. When I asked about such told she got two more tomatoes and olives. Really. That justify s the 6 dollars more. Son got chicken fingers way over cooked he left them. Wife pita sandwich ..she had to cut the chicken one big chuck.  Like really. I asked for lamb med got well. 

My server I told I was unhappy he could careless. Finally management came over . Who is the cook. Told doing it this way for 18 yrs. Know I know why this place was absolutely empty. He also should be wearing a hair net. I will never go back. Maybe worst experience yet locally."}
{"text":"We ordered take out and when we arrived to pick up our order, we were told that there was a separate entrance for take out and that we would have to leave the restaurant and go around the corner to the take out section.  It wasn't a big deal but I thought it was a rather arduous way of doing business since there didn't seem to be a lot of patrons in the restaurant or at the take out area.  Oh well.  

We ordered combo souvlaki dinner ($18.95) and a regular size Gyro dinner ($13.95).  And what a sore disappointment both dishes turned out to be.  

First of all, the combo souvlaki dinner is described as having \"2 pieces of beef, 2 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of lamb\" and what we got was really just 2 pieces of each meat with some onions and peppers on ONE skewer.  I thought for that kind of price tag, there would be at least a few skewers of souvlaki.  To add insult to injury, all the meat were grossly over-cooked.  I am not sure whose brilliant idea it was to put three different types of meat with different cooking times all on one skewer but the result was a stick of dried out and unpalatable souvlaki.  Served with 2 choices of vegs, rice, lemon potato or fries, small greek salad and just as uninteresting garlic bread, this was the worst deal ever.  

The gyro dinner did not fare better.  Although there was a generous serving of well-seasoned gyro meat, about half of the meat were dried out outer layer strips of teeth-breaking meat.  

We ordered veg and potatoes for one entree and rice and veg for the other.  And I must say, the only reason for my 2 star rating is their potatoes and the seasoning for gyro meat.  The steamed veggies served came straight out of a frozen bag (c'mon, you can't cut up your own veggies?) as the texture of carrots, broccoli and cauliflower bore the typical sponginess that frozen vegetable products have.  I think it's disgraceful that a restaurant can't even serve up decent steamed vegetables.  

An unfriendly server at the take out counter (a younger lass) who seemed genuinely uninterested in working there just made for an experience that we would not want to revisit."}
{"text":"I have only eaten from here once & will not be back. So let's make this as short & sweet as possible. 
I ordered takeout, came to pick it up about 10-15 minutes after ordering it. It wasn't ready. I had to wait another ten minutes or so to get my food. Finally got my food, took it home & everything was gross. Over salted or over cooked. The whole meal was just gross. I've never been back. I would ever recommend this place."}
{"text":"How very unfortunate....

That's really the only way to start this re-review. A friend and I went for dinner last night and since I wanted to try this place out again and she was feeling like greek food, we decided to head down to Milos. We got there around 7:30 and it wasn't busy at all, two other tables and I think one of them was family members of the owners or something. 

Wanting to try something that would give me a good sense of how this restaurant is, I ended up ordering the beef and lamb gyros dinner (regular size), which comes with a greek salad and two sides. I chose the rice and lemon potatoes. Our salads arrived fairly quickly and their salad is really growing on me. They brought over that weird hot dog bun as bread again but we ate it and it was tasty enough. 

When I got my main, it looked great! Full plate of food, TONS of gyro and tzatziki and lots of my side dishes. My friend and I were chatting away as we ate and as I ate more and more of it, I started to realize it wasn't all that great. The gyro was ridiculously salty. So much so that I left more than half and actually ended up waking up in the middle of the night so thirsty from this salty gyro. The rice was boring boring boring - I haven't had this kind of greek rice before, it had some kind of tomato base in it, but it had almost no flavor and wasn't a good addition to the plate. I was really looking forward to the lemon potatoes because they're one of my favourites but they were mediocre as well. I didn't get ANY lemon off these potatoes and they were basically just hunks of potato cooked in some kind of sauce that didn't have much flavor. 

The service was fine until the end, when they seemed to have forgotten about us. They cleared our plates away and since we were chatting we just kept on talking and waiting for them to come back with our bills or ask us for dessert (I was actually thinking about trying their Baklava or something) and they never did. I had to flag down the busboy/host and indicate that we wanted our check before the waitress brought it over.

All in all, this was a seriously disappointing meal. I'm not sure if this is authentic greek, but if it is then I guess I'm not much a fan of authentic greek food. This was a rather flavorless, too salty meal that didn't satisfy my greek craving at all. It's a sad day when I prefer food court greek over \"authentic greek\" and when I (not greek but italian) can make better more flavorful greek food myself. I'll be back for the salad I had last time, its tasty and the portion size was great, but I won't be coming back to this restaurant to eat in ever again."}
