{"text":"This place is really posh, well... Actually quite snobby, but! The food is brilliant!!!
We had a lovely time there, really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. Take into consideration that it's all light stuff, small portions and lots of tea. So it's the perfect place for brunch. 
Prices are fair enough. So it is rather nice all in all."}
{"text":"I must admit, I normally prefer not spending on finger food but Birks Café is clearly an exception! From the professional service to the beautiful presentation and chic ambience, everything seems perfect. So would I recommend this place? Hell, yes!

{"text":"I am giving this place three stars because the service was long...it took ruffly 30min to get our tea and then another 30 to get the food. We were two having tea and they gave us 4 scones however they only gave us one sweets for each of us by that  I mean the sweets were all different.What the hell is that about ? So we have to share the sweets in half. I am sorry but for the price we paid I was really not satisfied really not I was more disappointed then anything. I've been to other places for tea and we've been two and the other places gave us two of everything and it was cheaper. The good thing part was that the tea was good and the sweets were good as well but the fact that we had to share them wasn't really fun."}
{"text":"Décor 5/5 food 4/5 service 5/5 
Afternoon tea with 4 of my girlfriends... one of them had a seafood restriction so they gave her an individual plate which was delicious. I would give it all a 5/5 because everything tasted exquisite. I dropped it down to 4 stars because since we were 4 at our table I would expect enough of everything to share so that we wouldn't have to cut or split anything. We were 4 so they gave us 4 truffles and 4 macaroons for example...but each macaroon and truffle had a different flavor, so we had to decide who got what. Other than that I would definetly go back."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend who is crazy about high tea. The selection of tea is indeed abundant. The finger food was really great: the Devonshire cream was heavenly but it was the macaroons that stole the show. 

If you have an out-of-town friend who loves afternoon tea, this place would be a great contender."}
{"text":"This is a place where you can go buy diamonds then have afternoon tea. It's like Beverly Hills in Montreal. Girls, if you want to show your man the diamonds you want or score a watch on your wrist. Suggest to have afternoon tea at Birk's Cafe. The service is impeccable, the decor is grandeur and it is not pretentious which was a bonus for me."}
{"text":"The cafe is located inside a jewelry store, so it's definitely a pretty place to walk into. 
I came here with several friends for high tea, and while I can't say I was disappointed, I can't say I'm particularly impressed either
My favorite part of the set was definitely the tea and it's fragrant aroma.
The scones were decent - I wish they brought it to us warm, but what bugged me more was how they didn't ask what jams we wanted and automatically brought us clotted cream and this applesauce jam. Two of my friends who arrived late and ordered after us got clotted cream and strawberry jam, and while it may be petty, I wish they asked what we preferred because I would've definitely chosen strawberry jam.
Another thing that I was confused about was how one of their desserts was literally just berries in syrup.... Can't say I was too impressed 
Long story short, tea is good, atmosphere is nice, and food is decent but I wish they paid more attention to detail and what the customers prefer"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for the high tea after reading the reviews here. Had to wait two weeks to get a reservation for Sunday afternoon at 3pm, so we went to the high tea at Queen Elizabeth at Fairmont the week before. 

We arrived at Birks at 3 and were promptly seated. I looked around and saw that there were a couple of empty tables but these were quickly filled. It was not for another 15 mins before our server arrived, but not before I noticed the tables that arrived after us had already been served. He politely took our orders and we just kept waiting and waiting. The tea, followed by the sandwiches and pastries only arrived more than an hour. 

The sandwiches were good and I liked the foie gras canape but the breads were a little too dried out, as were the scones. A couple of macarons were served squashed. Because our tea arrived so late, they were rushing us out at quarter to five. The server said we could pack everything but not the verrines so we were basically just rushing through the desserts and my pot of tea was not even half finished.

The best part of the experience was the flavorful tea but it was a shame that we did not get the time needed to enjoy it. I hate to say this, but did feel racially profiled at this place. The service that other patrons received were perceptively warmer.
And for all the rush, it was definitely not the sort of high tea worth the value paid.

I would recommend high tea at the Fairmont instead. It is a more leisurely experience. The scones at Gryphon D'or tea room are the best in Montreal."}
{"text":"While in Montreal for a mini vacation, my husband and I were wandering and found this place.  Originally we stumbled into the building to look at the sparkling jewels in the window, but found Birks!  

Afternoon tea is one of my favorite things to do!  I love the relaxing nature of it.  The tea sandwiches and offerings were all delicious.  I noticed that each table that ordered this particular type of tea had similar items to us, but all varied in flavor or filling making the whole experience feel a bit personalized.  

Our server was friendly and even told us about some of the places in Montreal.  I wouldn't choose this place as an everyday destination, but it was great for a little treat while on vacation."}
{"text":"The food and decor was really great. Good tea (I recommend the rooibos). The scones was really good. I recommend to you to try the café. The only con is that it is expensive.

Food 5/5
Decor 5/5
Price 3/5"}
{"text":"Birks offers afternoon tea on weekdays after 2:30 for only $26.50/person so I decided to give it a try with my friend.

Their menu sounded fantastic and offered things such as \"Finger appetizer with smoked salmon and Abitibi Temiscamingue caviar\" but I felt as though they sounded better than they tasted. Despite that, the sandwiches were interesting to eat. Scones were a bit too heavy and my friend couldn't finish hers. Also, I thought that almost all of the desserts were overly too sweet - was difficult to eat the macaron and the desserts in a cup. We couldn't finish the desserts, and it wasn't because we were full.

I know I shouldn't expect too much out of an afternoon tea experience for under $30. For the price, it was a fun time to unwind after all the walking - great service and beautiful decor. I say that it was the entire experience that made it worth it, rather than the food. I am happy that I came here!"}
{"text":"Went here for high tea with the girls and it was passable although I wouldn't really come again. A lot of the things we got on our plate tasted as though they came from a grocery store (sandwich was bland and dried out as though it was made the night before, some of the bites seemed unfresh). I have to admit though that their scones and teas were excellent. I'd say definitely go if the novelty of eating in a jewelry store is worth it but otherwise if you've experienced English high tea else where you probably won't be impressed."}
{"text":"We went to a Briks Cafe, it was recommended by my friend. She's was so right to tell me to come here. The cafe is located inside a jewelry store, so it's definitely a pretty place to walk into. Pricey Macaron, but if I could I'll buy the whole store. They have a nice little cafe, we didn't eat here just because it looks pretty expensive and really I just wanted the Macarons, so we walked up to the counter and buy a pack of 12 for $20 bucks. 

The guy who served us was really nice although he got the order wrong the first time, I didn't mind it too much. The Macaron from Europea BESTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT EVER. I'm not kidding you. I need to go back and get some! 

Why can't Toronto have anything like this here!?!?

Go get yourself some fancy macarons! Well worth the price."}
{"text":"Was here for Montreal à Table, which features a special set menu at $19.  Quick summary: modern interior & decor, living-room level lighting, quiet for easy conversation, attentive service, well prepared and plated cuisine.

The restaurant is inside the west wall of the Birks jewelry store, up a small set of stairs (to their Mezzanine area), on the west side of Square Phillips.

The table is stylishly set with glassware by Birks in interesting, unique sandblasted/shaped pieces, which is a nice change from very ho-hum plain, boring glasses and even sets itself apart from the common crystal of Riedel, Spiegelau and friends.  Leather placemats are also an interesting departure from the norm.  

The pre-game snack consists of individual bread rolls and a little piece of bamboo shaped butter, dusted with green and fleur de sel sprinkled around the dish.  Beside that is a jar of self-serve, well-dressed mixed nuts.

The menu started with a butternut squash soup with cubes of tofu and squash, foam top, and a small sprout of something green for color, presented in dark brown bowl and plate.

Main dish was four raviolis of ricotta, swiss chard with white wine cream sauce and sautéed minced chorizo sprinkled about. Very decoratively plated (single file across the plate, raviolis sitting on leaves of wilted swiss chard and cream sauce, generously speckled with crimson chorizo).

Dessert was a choice of various layered pot de cremes, such as caramel, coffee, white chocolate, chocolate, lemon, etc, all brought out simultaneously for a on-the-spot visual selection.

For a $19 menu this is an absolute steal.  Birks Café did not skimp on quality/service for the restaurant fest."}
{"text":"Le cadre est exceptionnel puisqu'on est chez le fameux bijoutier Birk's (d'où la note)! 
Mais la carte demeure assez chère en plus de ne pas être très variée. 
C'est sympathique d'aller y boire un thé ou un café mais on se sent vite complexé du décorum et des gens qui le côtoient."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, we walked all the way here for their afternoon tea, just to find that the cafe was closed. No hint of that on yelp or google (with the address listed here). Just a small sign in French at the entrance of their now-empty second level where they once held the tea. Too bad. Was looking forward to trying this."}
{"text":"I only do things upscale. If you're poor you just can't hang out with me ok? Sorry. Just make more money. 

So I definitely only eat brunch in the best of places. Birks is such a place. From the excellent and smooth mimosa, to the beef tartare, quality is evident throughout. 

The fries that came with the beef were salted with sea salt, because table salt is for hoi polloi. 

I didn't even bother looking at the time on my Cartier watch. After brunch, I descended into the jewelry section to peruse their inventory. I think I may purchase a tank watch next time. 

Well toodleoo and have a good day. Oh be a good sport and get my car for me."}
{"text":"We did not have a good experience of our afternoon tea at Birks in Montreal. We were quickly escorted to our seats but it took a while before we got to order. Two of our six teas were only lukewarm. The waiter replaced the water but didn't replace the tea.  The appetizers/food came way after the tea. I felt the service was bad, the water could be hotter, and the desserts were too sweet. I would not come back to this place."}
{"text":"Finger foods are good. Desserts still need to improve though. the price is fair and the atmosphere is good too. but we have to wait till 2.30 to start."}
{"text":"J'ai été séduite par l'originalité du lieu qui nous permet d'entrer par une bijouterie puis de s'installer à une table de restaurant le temps d'un brunch. le décor est luxueux propre et très soigné. Coté carte le brunch annoncé me donne l'eau à la bouche même si pour ma part il manque sans doute un peu d'originalité. Coté dégustation je n'ai pas été déçue, coté prix c'est certainement un peu cher mais ça se vaut . Par contre coté service j'ai été un peu déçue ... au vu du prestige du lieu ! A mon gout il manquait un peu de sourire et d'accueil. Mention spéciale au poivrières."}
{"text":"Very fancy looking place that can be quite intimidating at first. The waiters were all very nice and the service was great. The food didn't look like much for the price you pay, but when you get to the scones, then you start to feel full. Everything was delicious and the teas were a delight! I find it pretty pricey, but then again I had a wonderful experience. I would definitely go back again for some girls-day-out activity."}
{"text":"This place combines jewelery shopping and Tea at the same time. Honestly, what more could a girl ask for?

Well, I have to admit most of my friends I dragged here - were a bit taken aback that I said I needed to go to Birks to buy Macrons - because I missed visiting the year before. The place isn't big and the cafe is located on the mezzanine of the jewelery store - so in order to  get to the cafe you would have to pass the counters to walk up the short flight of stairs to get there - which if you think about it give you a chance to browse for anything you \"might\" want to put on a wish list for some future date. 

Price wise the Macrons were pretty good - worth a visit and they held up well - all things considering since i didn't even get around to eating the second box until a week later.

Favorite flavors - definitely the pear and the cassis

Side note for the guys : it's not exactly a bad place for a romantic afternoon tea date either since it combines a girl's love of pretty and sweet things all in one pretty package."}
{"text":"Went for an afternoon tea on a Wednesday afternoon. It was pleasant and the treats were delicious. The tea was really good and complimented well with the menu. Perhaps the only surprising part was a huge sandwich of prosciutto and cheese. That felt like an anomaly amongst all the petit finger food and bite-sized sweet treats. But the overall experience was very relaxing, calm and pleasant. A lovely subdued and classy way to spend an afternoon with a friend while taking a break from shopping along the busy St Catherine street. :)"}
{"text":"When I saw a coupon for the afternoon tea at Birks Cafe, I had to drag my friend and go try it. We loved the ambiance and the interior of the building and the cafe section. We took pictures of the presentation and the tea experience was overall nice, however some pastries were not to our liking. For example the macarons tasted like artificial color and flavoring. Perhaps the chef's specialty does not include macarons, in that case, he should drop making those delicate macarons and concentrate on other mignardises. I'm not sure I'd go back though. I'm off to try the hotel high teas now."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the Macarons from Europea. 

I had a small taste of these petite delights when Kat K & Jennifer K so generously shared them during a previous UYE.  Since then, I've had flashback cravings particulièrement for the pear flavour, so I took hubby to task and requested he bring me back some from his jaunt to Montreal.

On the whole I found the centre fillings a little overtly butter-creamy and très sucrés, but the shell is possibly the best tasting I've tried.  Very light textured yet so almondy with a nice soft delicate crumbliness.  A  word of warning, because of their delicate nature I'd handle them with extra care.  Hubby brought my box of 12 home and about 3 of the macarons were crushed
 :(  then again he is a mega klutz...let's blame it on the husband :D"}
{"text":"D'accord, on est chez un bijoutier qui vend des cailloux très, très chers. L'endroit est bien décoré. La nourriture... ordinaire. À l'heure du thé, du moins. Le foie gras, offert en quantité lilliputienne, est correct. Les petits gâteaux et autres mignardises, les minis sandwichs, ça va. mais pour l'ambiance... Se déplacer à huit pour prendre le thé, c'est assez \"habitant\" . Sinon, on baisse le ton, ce n'est pas le Peel pub. Les serveurs auraient du ramener à l'ordre les clients au comportement dérangeant. Il y a un décorum à respecter. Des gens l'ignorent. Ce n'est pas la place du cellulaire, non plus. Très peu de sérieux dans ce salon de thé. Rien à voir avec Le Reine Élizabeth. Ah! oui... On avait pas pris notre réservation. Allô professionnalisme!"}
{"text":"L'an dernier, je me suis rendue au Birks Café pour souligner mon anniversaire avec ma meilleure amie. Nous avions décidé d'aller vivre l'expérience du Afternoon tea au Café de la célèbre bijouterie. 

Il y a un menu unique, soit le service complet à 26,50$/personne. 

Le menu inclus :

- Sélection de thé
- Petit pot de lait et citron
- Petit canapé de concombre et crevettes
- Petit canapé au foie gras et chutney
- Petit canapé au saumon boucané et caviar d'Abitibi Témiscamingue
- Petit club sandwich aux croustilles de prosciutto
- 2 scones nature
- Crème Devonshire
- Confiture maison
- Petite verrine gourmande
- 1 macaron
- 1 chocolat fin

OUF! Beaucoup de nourriture pour le service du thé! Nous croyions déguster quelques bouchées seulement et ensuite aller souper avec d'autres amis. Erreur! Nous étions repues après le service du thé! 

Les canapés étaient bons, mais souvent secs. Notre coup de cur : les scones, et de loin!

L'ambiance et l'expérience qu'on retrouve au Birks Café est à l'image de la bijouterie : Chic, élégante, raffinée et calme. 

Je conseille aux amateurs de thé de s'y rendre pour vivre l'expérience, mais il ne faut pas s'attendre à être jetés par terre par la nourriture. Ce qui fait qu'on apprécie l'expérience est l'ensemble de l'uvre (belle ambiance, service distingué, jolies présentations, décor, etc.)"}
{"text":"I don't believe this!! For my trip to Montreal I was too busy eating \"MEAT\" and I forgot to have any Marcons.......

My Sweet Kat K remembers my passion for sweet and at our UYE she just presented us with a box of assorted flavours of Marcons from Birk Cafe! 

Even after almost a week, they are still so so so good... The shell has the right texture and the fillings has great flavour...just the right amount of sweetness.. So pretty too... Polka dot marcons! :)

I really want to eat the whole box... but I ended up sharing them with other yelpers... I secretly wish they all said \"No! I am on a diet!\""}
{"text":"I took my mom there for mother's day and it proved to be the perfect spot for the occasion: a three-course meal of small portions, posh surroundings, and a view of the macarons counter. The meal was a fixed $39 pp and we were very full by the end of it, despite the small portions. I love that they have Mariage Frères teas included in the brunch menu."}
{"text":"Birks Café is a fun place to meet your girls for an afternoon tea.  Although it is now open weekdays to serve lunch, you want to go to Birks cafe for its brunch or for its special menu during weekend afternoons. For 26,50$, you can chose a tea from their selection, with a variety of small eats such as scones, macarons, little sandwiches... They even include a goodie bag for you to bring back home! On the regular menu, you can chose a beautiful ice cream with loads of fruits, a sweet verrine or a light dish.  Although a little pricey, it is fun from time to time to pamper yourself ;)"}
