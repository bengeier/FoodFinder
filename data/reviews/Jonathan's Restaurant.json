{"text":"We (five of us) drove 15 minutes to get to Jonathan's largely because of the 4.5 stars on YELP.  The food was good, the prices fair and the service prompt and friendly but  a four or five star breakfast spot this is not.  The menu is limited to ordinary diner food and the decor is non de script.  If you are nearby looking for an inexpensive mean, go to Jonathan's.  If you are looking for more of a great brunch spot, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Under new ownership, cooking one meal at a time. Waited 45 minutes and didn't get my 3 eggs with bacon."}
{"text":"Okk service not too fast or polite but not bad eather. the food if fine n9thing amazing."}
{"text":"Wow ! I can't believe people think this is good breakfast food. (NOT) I travel a lot and trust me this food is lacking in taste! I had a Jonathan omelette and grits and it looked good on the plate but the omelette was just ok and the grits taste like they were instant and mushy and tasteless ! The biscuit was hard as rock! My advice is try somewhere else! You can do better at a waffle house!!"}
{"text":"We held a baby shower at Jonathan's on October 17th. It was great. The food was great, staff wonderful, and the prices are so reasonable. We paid a small deposit, staff set up the room and even offered to help decorate. We went there about a month before to have lunch and was very impressed. A big thank you to all the staff and especially to Sherry who set things up for us and to Ann who worked so hard to make the shower such a success! I highly recommend this restaurant whether going out to eat with family or hosting a party. Thanks again ladies!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed for the area. Terrible host service, very unorganized seating. Once seated I thought I entered a time warp or more like an assisted living or something. NOT YOUNG OR FAST wait staff. Had to ask for the table to be wiped off and I think the white table cloths should be left for dinner but maybe they don't know how to turn over for meals?? Lighting was very dim at 10:30 am. Had to ask for silverware,the response was: \" let me see if I could find some because we run out at this time \". Ummmmm???? Yes that was my reaction. That's  just a little on the inside. The outside entrance was dull and not really inviting with the cheesy neon sign almost on the roof. The duck pond was dirty and emitted an odor. The parking lot needed to be cleaned as well. And the spaces are tight and cars just park randomly. Not good if you don't like door dings. Oh I didn't visit the restroom cause I used my hand wipes so go at your own risk.  The owners need to STOP, reassess and remodel. Maybe then they won't need to have a hand written sign \"looking for cooks\". My 10 yr old would have had breakfast out faster.  Just saying. Good luck."}
{"text":"Both the service and the food was great ...found this place here on yelp coming back from Sunday golf ..glad we stopped in ...recommend the pemeal club sandwich."}
{"text":"This used to be a good place to eat. But the last 2 times we have been there it has been a bad experience. The food was very greasy. The plates looked like they had black soot on them. It would not rub off so it must have been age but it looked awful.

Not a place I can recomend."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Jonathans for a few years.  The health grade rating is excellent .  Every time I dine here I view the rating it is always 100%.  The severs and hostess make you feel special. They make the best grilled cheese and tomato on rye sandwich ever! The tomatoes are always red and juicy.  The potato salad is some of the best I have ever had.
The prices are reasonable and the quality is excellent
They also serve wine and beer....cheers!!."}
{"text":"Great food and service as long I have been going there never I had a bad experience keep up the good work everybody"}
{"text":"All i want is a simple breakfast. Seems like a lot of resaurants out there have to have some kind of unique twist on breakfast and usually it tastes funky. this place is excellent simple idea perfect eggs everytime!"}
{"text":"I've been keeping an eye on the restaurant inspections for Jonathans, and their last 2 inspections were back up in the mid 90's ... good for them.  Tho there is still some sloppiness in the kitchen resulting in their demerits. We have eaten there again a few times and enjoyed the food without problems, tho I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the TV on the wall playing whatever channel someone sets it to ... sometimes it's not a program conducive to a nice meal setting. C'mon people ... pay attention!  Be aware, and make it a nice dining environment for your customers!"}
{"text":"Ok breakfast.  Quiet setting.  The pond out front looked tired, worn, and dirty."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying staff was great friendly courteous and everything about the ordering and such was great.  I have been coming here off and on for years but it has really started to go downhill breakfast was always good now just ok.  I ordered spaghetti the other day for lunch and the meatballs were freezer burnt  and terrible.  Food has just gotten bland  no creativity."}
{"text":"I don't know.

Wow... was I disappointed... the landscaping looked awful with duck and goose crap / trash by the adjoining pond. The restaurant interior is falling apart, the food was bland, and the service on par with Waffle House. How they got a 97 food inspection rating is a miracle or a payoff. And I am in my 50s and I felt young... it's sad to see a place not being taken care of to squeeze every dime it can."}
{"text":"I go there quite often for many years now. The staff treats me and my friends very well; they've gotten to know us camping out after lunch. Food is good and affordable."}
{"text":"Visiting my family from Florida and decided to have a breakfast out. Since it was 10am and we didn't want a long wait I headed to Yelp and came across this place. What a gem! No wait, friendly and fast service, great food, good prices and GREAT coffee!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We were staying at a hotel in Vaughan, and wanted a local place for breakfast without having to go downtown. At first, after seeing the lack of reviews, we were reluctant to go. I'm glad we did! They had a variety of vegetarian/chicken options, and the portions were huge! It seems like a family owned restaurant, the staff was extremely friendly. The diners were mostly locals. We had a pleasant conversation with the old lady sitting at the table next to us. Would definitely come back the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. Our server was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. 

The food is typical breakfast food. We went for the price. It's not the most delicious or fancy type food. But we ordered the $5.95 special and had the bacon. The bacon was yummy. The potatoes were ok. But for the price you can't complain. Normally this would be three stars but I gave it four because the price is cheap."}
{"text":"Your average step-above-Waffle-House type of place. Yummy breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Jonathan's is a very nice place. Very quiet and friendly atmosphere. You must sit by the window so you can see the ducks through the window near the pond. The service is best. I had the Jonathan's Special 2eggs (scrambled) one meat, hashbrowns, home fries or grits (had the grits w/ cheese) it had 2singles of cheese on top of the grits...Lol not really my idea of cheese grits."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast place that meets the target in virtually every respect. I had the steak and eggs which was a good deal at $13.99. The steak was pretty solid for its price point. One thing I like about this place is that they don't overdo the portions. I like how the serving of home fries was a reasonable amount, and not having to feel bad about food waste - or just eating more than you want because it's still in front of you (I have issues with restraint).

About the only negative was that there were clearly two different batches of home fries plated for both my wife and I, since some bites were warmer than others. Naturally, breakfast places go through huge batches and can't cook to order, but they still need to do a better job of managing that.

Apart from that, loved everything about the breakfast, and the coffee wasn't too weak, which is often what you can expect at many breakfast joints. Wonderful service too."}
{"text":"First time diner at Jonathan's, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. Service was friendly and quick even though almost every table was occupied. Portions were decent, food and coffee were quite tasty. Best of all, 4 of us ate for $55, tax and tip included. Great deal, great food and great service. I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great food and service and never too busy to get a table.  The portions are quite good and I often share the breakfast platter with my sister."}
{"text":"From the outside you can barely tell this is even a restaurant, it is definitely no frills. When we walked in the sign said please wait to be seated but the lady bobbed her head and said sit wherever. When the waitress came over she didn't speak english well and was very unkempt. I went to use the restroom which was very clean how ever on the way back I saw 2 waitress leaning on a rail and one was stuffing her face with a sandwich. Meanwhile a lady at another table practically had to yell across the restaurant to get a refill on her drink. These servers were clearly not in the mood to serve people. I ordered marinated chicken tips one of my favorite dishes I have had many times at different restaurants and a salad. When she brought everyones salads to the table there wasn't one for me, so she had to go back and bring one out. When my chicken arrived it looked really yummy to bad looks can be deceiving because it was terrible. It was so bland and the chicken was dry. I tried to add salt and finally I had to use ketchup, the mac and cheese was ok nothing special. Needless to say I was very disappointed and I will not be returning to Jonathan's any time soon."}
{"text":"How can I not be a fan when I eat here so much.  This used to be a Tryon House.  Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner!  This is a different kind of place, more like a comfortable diner.  Plenty of regulars like a neighborhood hangout the staff remember what I like and it is very relaxed, and Complimentary Soup!  You know where you are now!

The Spaghetti with Meat sauce is what I usually get, with Turnip Greens instead of salad.  This is not fine dinning, though it is better flavor than most of the Charlotte area more expensive Italian Restaurants, though that is not saying a lot.  The sign does say Italian and they do have some Italian/Greek/Italian and Greek dishes, though I would consider it more of a diner and an easy 4 yelp stars all the way around, especially considering the price."}
{"text":"Solid place for breakfast standards. Nothing extraordinary, but decent & prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"I must say, I am very impressed.  It is not a fancy smancy restaurant, but it is a good restaurant.  The food is excellent.  I met a friend here for lunch.  There was a total of five in our party.  We order fish, shrimp, jerk chicken, lasagna, carrot cake, lemon mereguine pie and apple pie.  The fist was lightly breaded, the jerk checken was not over powerfully seasoned and the chicken was tender and juicy.  The shrimp was the children's plate and the portion was very appropriate.  The desserts were very good.  Not too sweet and very large.  The restaurant is very clean, the service is excellent, and the food was good without being greasy.  The prices are extremely competitve.  I will definitely visit again, and I would recommend a friend."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here this morning, and it was really pretty good. The place was packed, as it's apparently quite popular with the family set. There were kids and grandmas and moms and whole flocks of people in clusters. It's huge inside, so it would definitely be a good place for groups. 

Four of us had breakfast for less than $30, so it's totally affordable. There's a gorgeous duck pond outside, so I'm excited for the next time my niece visits. We'll go there so she can feed her leftover biscuits to the black swans.

Jonathan's also hosts frequent little shows, which definitely cater to an older (read: senior) crowd, but some of them look like they could be kind of fun. They have Blues Brothers impersonators and a Roy Orbison impersonator on a regular basis. I can only imagine th elaughs that would ensue from a few beers and a night of Roy Orbison impersonator hair."}
{"text":"Small restaurant, clean and causal.
The prices have increased, paid $13 for eggs Benedict, $13 for the Hungry Mab breakfast, $2.50 for chocolate milk and $2.25 for coffee.

Food was average, my eggs Benedict came with smoked salmon but the \"smoked\" salmon was cooked and dry so not the best eggs benny I've had.

I was dissatisfied that the price for chocolate milk and coffee on their menu was different than what we were charged for. Menu price for coffee was 1.95 but we were charged $2.25, and for chocolate milk menu price was $2 but they charged us 2.50... they didn't offer to give us the difference back, which i think is bad business"}
{"text":"I go to Jonathans 1-2x/month and it is always excellent food. I hardly ever have to wait and the booths are quite large and comfortable. I usually go there for breakfast, always get 2 eggs, hashbrowns, sausage, toast and coffee and the price is Great! I recently met some friends there for dinner and a meeting, we had half the restaurant to ourselves. So they were very accommodating for our business presentation. Their menu is quite expansive, so many choices for dinner, I took a good 15 minutes to decide. The wait-staff are always attentive and come by with refills on the drinks every 5 minutes. So if you are looking for great food and a more than reasonable price, you need to go to Jonathans!"}
{"text":"I went to Jonathan's last Saturday for breakfast based on reviews alone.  Wow... was I disappointed... the landscaping looked awful with duck and goose crap / trash by the adjoining pond. The restaurant interior is falling apart, the food was bland, and the service on par with Waffle House. How they got a 97 food inspection rating is a miracle or a payoff. And I am in my 50s and I felt young... it's sad to see a place not being taken care of to sueeze every dime it can."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, but apparently this is the place to be for breakfast.  Need to try it out sometime and then update my review.  

We were in the search for Italian food, but this place has a variety of Italian, Greek, and American food.  It was a bit eerily quiet for dinner on a Saturday night, but that just allowed our server to give us more attention.  This is the kind of place where you have regulars and the servers ask you about how your kids are doing (not that I have any).  Put very local and personal - a nice little addition to Matthews restaurants.

The building itself is \"off the beaten path\" located near the Target in Matthews.  It has a strange set up - as if it was converted into a restaurant after the fact.  It seemed to be like a meeting hall or common space since you come in and there is a huge greeting area and front desk.  Since it was a slow night, only half of the dining room was being used - I can imagine the place going super crazy for breakfast on the weekends, but at least they have the extra space."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! 
Ordered some simple French toast and there was a 4 in piece of blonde hair in my toast! How did I discover it? I bit into the toast! How disgusting! Went back to the establishment and was simply told \"sorry about that\". She wasn't even surprised to hear that I found hair in my food. As if this is something that happens often. Also, other items in my order were not complete as they should have been. I communicated my dissatisfaction to the person \"in charge\" and she completely ignored me and walked away. I will never eat at a place that he such disregard for sanitation practices such as cooks wearing a hair net and a chefs hat and high disregard for customer feedback."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since this was a Tryon House - which admittedly was quite a while back. The place hasn't changed much on the outside, and the inside looks about the same as well. It is possible that even the menu and staff haven't changed much either.

The line can also get a bit crazy at times - there seems to be one almost any time you go by the place, at least in the morning hours (for whatever reason, we don't get by the area much later in the day). Nothing wrong with that - we can use more breakfast places in the area.

Service is generally friendly, without being overly in your face or leaving you wanting, which is a good thing. The menu, as dated as it may be, is fairly uninspiring. There isn't much here that you will be thinking about once you leave, but it's not bad either. Just a simple, solid menu that will typically fill you up and get you on your way.

For those of you that do recall the Tryon House, this isn't it. Where you use to have food piled high (or wide, in the case of a few dishes), you'll come up a bit short. You won't have a problem getting full here, but you may not have quite as much to go as you used to get at the old place. Still not a bad deal if you just want some standard American fare without much surprise to the food or the bill."}
{"text":"Why doesn't this place have more reviews? This is my second time here for hangover breakfast and its starting to feel like \"our\" place

The server is always the same guy. So nice and patient especially when I'm struggling to get my life together and make a decision about my food

Food is solid and comes out quick!  homefries are well seasoned. Good coffee. I got a burger the second time and it was piping hot and delicious. I see ppl order a bunch of diff things and it always looks good.

Will probably be back in a week or so hehe"}
{"text":"The wife and I checked out Jonathan's a couple weeks ago for dinner. We were excited to see that they serve breakfast all day. I do enjoy breakfast for dinner!! I ordered an omelet with a side of smoked sausage and hashbrowns with wheat toast. The western omelet was good sized but lacked flavor. The hashbrowns were very good. My wife said it reminded her of the ones you get a Waffle House. The smoked sausage was disappointing. I'm used to a little \"snap\" with my sausage but this one was almost mushy on the inside. My opinion on this place is they need to over hall the decor and bring it up to date or leave it and keep serving the retired folks. Still debating on whether to give it another shot. On a side note, if you're an Elvis fan, apparently the fan club meets here once or twice a month, so they have that going for them."}
{"text":"Been here mostly earlier and for breakfast and lunch. For what it is , they are great. Really great pricing and good room for privacy."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant with some difficulty. The address encompasses many industrial/retail units which wrap around that plot of land. The address is on the side street although the restaurant faces the main street, hwy 7. Additional signage would have helped. When we were driving closer to it, it was not noticeable until the storefront prior (almost as if the sign was slanted to face away.)

Parking was a bit snug. Many vehicles had parked across lines or right on the lines on both sides of a spot. The parking spaces were of the new narrow size.

The service was very quick. Our refreshments came quickly. I was pleasantly surprised by the enormous personal thermal pot with the hot tea within. The tea was properly brewed and using this system stayed hot for all the cups I drank.

The breakfasts were nicely portioned and presented on the plates. The eggs are listed as three per order but we were assured that they were smaller sized eggs as we had a concern that they would have been too large a portion. My strip bacon was generously supplied and crisp the way I like them, I had not specified. I could taste something else in the home fries but only on a couple of morsels and my meal mate had not noticed any at all on her plate. Her plate had a good size portion of peameal bacon the way she likes it.

The only down side was a rude customer that took two phone calls on speaker. To top it off it appears he was a lawyer and was discussing matters I would not want a busy restaurant to overhear. I asked our hostess if he was a regular and she said she had never seen him previously in the restaurant. Thank goodness is all I can say although he took away from a positive experience."}
{"text":"Nice and small restaurant for breakfast. 
The waitress was really friendly and kept checking up to make sure we were okay. 
The portions are huge and very filling. I got 3 eggs with ham, sausage bacon and toast - for under $10. Although not the best sausages or potatos, but you really can't complain for the price.

Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Was an excellent breakfast cafe style restaurant!

Service was great. 

And the food was delicious!

Always love this independent owned places usually is where you get the best kinds of foods!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant while coming into the area to buy a bathroom fan.  Experience is excellent overall.

Food: I ordered Peameal Egg Benedict with home fries.  Egg Benedict was excellent.  An interesting combo with peameal.  Home fries were outstanding.  Really liked the way they fried it.  Hard, a little dry on the outside, yet not burnt.  One of the best home fries I've had.  The complementary coffee was good.  Not world class, but definitely not bad at all.

Service: What stands out the most for me with this restaurant is the service.  When I came in, before I even sit down, the guy asked me if I'd like a coffee.  When I ordered the Benedict, he asked if I like the egg pouch soft, regular or hard.  After food arrived, guy actually came by and asked how the food was.  Whenever I finished with my coffee, he came by and asked whether I'd like to refill.  All these may not seem like much, but if u really think about it, u probably won't get these kinda service even if u r having breakfast in a fancy hotel restaurant.

Environment: The environment is good overall.  It's clearly a family owned restaurant.  Very relaxing.  U could hear they were joking and having fun inside the kitchen. The place looks clean in general.  I didn't notice any annoying bug, even thou we r at the beginning of June.  When I sit down thou, I did have to wipe off some leftover bread crumbles off the chair.

Overall, from a price vs quality standpoint, I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We discovered this place a few months ago and have become converts.
Let's start with the staff. During the week, the server is fantastic. She's friendly, welcoming and accommodating. Her service skills are excellent. On the weekends, we've gotten a younger gentleman who is just as good as the weekday staff. He's friendly, efficient and attentive. Both are great !
The food is basic breakfast fare. Their weekday specials are great considering the amount of food you get. Deals like these are going by the wayside. Their home fries are worth the trip alone.
I've yet to have a meal that disappointed me, and I've been here at least 8 times."}
{"text":"Thought this was a church at first. The decor reminded me of a Greek restaurant in Detroit, but this is an Italian restaurant. Had breakfast & it was good. Duck/goose pond was a cool attraction. But where there are ducks/geese, there's poop! My lil girl enjoyed seeing the baby ducks tho.....
P/S: HEY ALL YOU RESTAURANTS OUT THERE, PLEASE CONSIDER PUTTING A STEP STOOL AT THE SINK IN THE BATHROOM FOR THE LITTLE CUSTOMERS WHO NEED TO WASH THEIR HANDS TOO!  Thank you, a single mom of two."}
{"text":"Really cute place for breakfast. Good food good coffee. I would have liked the menu to have more choices. Refills were done promptly and very polite staff. I would like to give 5 starts but there is always room for improvement."}
