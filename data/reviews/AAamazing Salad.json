{"text":"Such a delicious and healthy lunch spot. The food is fresh, flavourful and excellent value for the portion size. Definitely not your typical boring salad place. Lots of interesting ingredients and excellent dressings. The staff are super friendly. I now go here at least twice a week for lunch. So far, my favorites are the buddha bowl, rainbow wasabi bowl and super salad."}
{"text":"This is tied with Veggie D'Light as one of the most cheerful spots in Kensington Market! Lots of filling and nutritious options for plant-based people - I appreciate how they clearly mark items as vegetarian/vegan/gluten-free. Try their Buddha bowl - lots of fresh veggies, soba, cilantro, and the most delicious peanut sauce. Not much seating inside but when it's nice out, there are a couple of benches on Baldwin Street."}
{"text":"Love this place! A large salad or wrap, stuffed full of veggies and other goodies, and for a reasonable price. Plus the customer service is great. I would come here 10000x before going to Urban Herbivore. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Gross. Rubber chicken. Can't call yourself a healthy food joint when the chicken isn't pure grilled and fresh. I will stick with IQ."}
{"text":"The salad was perfect, modest portions and speedy service.  Healthy & delicious !"}
{"text":"While on a long walk around Toronto, I dipped into Kensington Market about lunch time. Not wanting something heavy and fatty(burgers, deli, etc.), I spotted Aaamazing Salads. Very small menu, but very friendly service, fresh ingredients, tasty dressing. I got the Eastern salad  with mixed lettuce and spinach, shredded carrots, cucumber, tomatoes, broccoli, celery, popped corn chips, black beans, Edamame, and toasted sesame seeds with classic balsamic vinaigrette and yogurt wasabi. Just $7.99 - including a can of pop/soda. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Delicious soup. Ordered the spinach/tofu and did not disappoint. Perfectly matched with a side strawberry  banana  smoothie.   Back again. Ordered the same thing because it was so good the first time around."}
{"text":"Great little spot in Kensington to grab a healthy, filling and delicious meal. Too bad it's taken me this long to discover it. I stopped by for lunch after a long morning of working out and running errands, and the Tokyo rice bowl with Tofu just hit the spot - brown rice, edamame, tomatoes, cucumbers and other delicious goodies with soy dressing to bring it all together.   The space is small but there are a couple tables for you to enjoy your meal.   They have a good selection of salads, rice bowls and soups. Can't wait to try the rainbow wasabi bowl next!"}
{"text":"My asian salad came with a free drink and the dressing was really good, but I wish that the salad had been a bit heartier. Next time I will order one of the bowls or get some add-ons for my salad, as it was tasty nonetheless. Apparently they donate some of their earnings to SickKids, which stuck with me."}
{"text":"Ordered the Buddha bowl and super salad!  They were both really good! The ingredients were very fresh.  The place is very small, there was only one table, it's more suitable for take out. Will definitely go back! Oh! Loved the noodles in the Buddha bowl!!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something light that I could add protein to. I meant to go to a nearby restaurant, but their door was open instead! The service was fast and friendly, and their food was not only a good value but very tasty (I got a rocket bowl)!  The atmosphere is great, and I love the decoration. The only issue that threw me was that the music was choppy."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place a few times, and it always seemed to be empty. So I assumed this place was fairly average. Boy was I wrong. AAAmazing Salad is - you guessed it - aaaaaaaaamazing. I've had the rainbow wasabi bowl twice and tried a few bites of the buddha bowl. The bowls are yummy and the portions are good! I will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I love AAamazing Salad! The Rainbow Wasabi Bowl is my favourite, but any of the bowls are really delicious. Haven't tried a salad yet but they are very popular too. The owners run the restaurant, and they are always very happy to serve everyone and know the regulars etc. A small portion of every purchase goes to SickKids hospital too. I love having a healthy, fresh, and affordable place to get lunch in Kensington. Similar places like Urban Herbivore are much more expensive, but also bigger portions. I find AAS portions are just right (nothing goes to waste), and the price point is appropriate for those who buy lunch frequently. Each bowl or salad comes with a drink too. They also use the app RITUAL for fast ordering via Apple Pay, and when you pick up in the restaurant you get to skip the line. They also have a stamp card - for every 10 bowls/salads, you get one free (unless you pay using RITUAL, then you can't get a stamp).  Love this place and I hope they have continued success!"}
{"text":"Cute little eatery in Kensington Market serving up fresh salads and savoury soups. Located right across the large parking garage near the intersection of Spadina and Baldwin.  Visually appealing food that's filling and healthy, served by sweet staff. Yes, I definitely would return."}
{"text":"Just finished having my first salad from AAamazing Salads and it was the best salad I've had in a while.  I love that she house makes all of the dressings, you can taste the difference.  Much better than Freshhi and other salad joints and more reasonably priced.  She's also super friendly, even when she was packed with customers she made time to make small talk and thank you for coming.  I will be back, probably a lot!"}
{"text":"AAmazing Salad really is quite good. The ingredients are very fresh, and service is better than average.  They have a nice selection of salad and wrap options. The Asian salad wrap is a personal favourite. However, if you add chicken, the wrap by itself comes to $12.41 out the door. Not crazy expensive, yet not a bargain either.  Seating here is limited. Unless you are lucky enough to get one of there 2-3 tables, plan on taking yours to go."}
{"text":"Love their salads and wrap, good portion and taste so good! It's really aaamazing salad!!!!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to another restaurant, when the pumpkin soup caught my eye. Then the aroma of fresh ingredients pulled me in and I'm so glad it did!  They're Tom Yum soup is delicious and satisfying, especially once you add chicken, egg and avocado! The mango/yogurt smoothie didn't have the characteristic over-sweeteness that overpowers the fruit flavours; it was perfect.   If you're looking for a satisfying, healthy and fresh meal with real food ingredients, this is a perfect spot."}
{"text":"Makes my favourite salad in the city! I love their Cobb Salad! Super fresh ingredients, in house made dressings, impeccable service! Always open to modifications and very reasonable pricing. I am surprised they are not fully packed everyday!"}
{"text":"What a great find ... I know healthy eating and salads are sometimes considered boring but this place does them well with flavour.  Probably my favourite salad in Kensington for sure.  Though it's a small space, it packs a lot of choices and flavours to keep you thinking you should try more.  In addition to salads, there are healthy smoothies, buddha bowls, and soups.  All around a lot of options who are hungry and want something that won't cause them to have a heart attack.  The spot is super clean and though it is small, there's at least 6 spots to sit down and eat if you want.    Service from the gentleman is kind and patient... he offers suggestions as what is popular as there are many options to read through.  It makes things challenging to find just one on his menu.  What I do love is that he double checks everything we want and if something is not quite right to his standards (he didnt want to serve the quinoa just yet... he didnt think they were ready enough).  He apologizes and tells us when he can give it to us.  The other nice touch is that he donates a portion of each item to Sick Kids.  How's that for giving back to the community?  Energy Salad - The overflowing bowl had so much that I had to carefully lift up the first few pieces or I'd start a vegetable avalanche.  With a quinoa, corn, carrots, purple cabbage, shredded beets, spinach tomatoes, crunchy corn chips, and egg... this was pretty filling.  It was dressed lightly in a flavourful an Asian sesame vinagrette.  Everything was fresh... nothing wilted or discoloured.  The best part.. price point.  It was under $11! 4/5  Rocket Bowl - Similar to the energy salad, the bowl was filled to the top and had so much healthy ingredients.  The bottom third was quinoa and then it was sauced up with 'chickpea sauce'. Im not sure what exactly that is but I do know it's a thick savoury sauce that is quite bold and delicious.  It was then topped with tons of corn, black beans, shredded carrots, broccoli, cabbage, egg, avocado, sun dried tomato, pita chips, black olives, green onion and chia seeds.  I dont think we could have fit more into the bowl.  Mixed together, it was a nice bite of crispy, savoury, and creamy.  Similar to the salad, it's really affordable and under $11.  You can't beat the price. 4/5  I think I found my favourite spot in Kensington for healthy food... for such a small store, it really delivers on super big bowls of flavour and great vegetable ingredients.  Definitely coming back here so I can get my day's worth of vegetables before getting ice cream or a matcha dessert down the street!"}
{"text":"This spot is very cute and has lots of selection. It was surprisingly really empty on a Friday night.  I'm not really a big fan of salads/leafy greens but I decided to give it a try anyway (reads: needed fibre). I had the Buddha Bowl with chicken. The base is with a soba noodle with peanut sauce + edemame + veggies. It came with a bag of veggie chips and a bottle of water. I was pleasantly surprised that the bowl was warm when I received it. The noodles on the bottom are warm which made the salad better. I like how well mixed in the peanut sauce was. The lime on the side was a tasty addition. The overall portion was quite big and left me really full. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough chicken. Not quite AAamazing, but worth a try."}
{"text":"After seeing the aaamazing reviews (ha!) I had to check out this hole-in-the-wall place just outside the borders of Kensington market. I must say, I'm a huge fan of all the fresh and bright flavours of their salads!  I ordered the ENERGY SALAD which was put together in a plastic bag and shaken with the asian sesame vinaigrette it came with before being served in a bowl. It's super nutritious with the spinach and quinoa base. I particularly like the toppings of dried figs, feta cheese, crunchy pita chips, and an assortment of fresh vegetables. The hard-boiled egg also added some protein to make it more filling too!  For ~$10 for a filling and tasty salad, I would definitely come back!"}
