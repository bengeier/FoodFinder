{"text":"This is a real old-school pizza joint, run by a young couple.   The pizza is big and heavy, Greek-style I'd call it...  I tend to stick to their souvlaki plates which are HUGE and fantastic quality.   They don't put everything in the same container so you get mushy fries and warm salad, and I appreciate that.  Service is always extremely fast and friendly too.   It's pricier than chain pizza, but worth it, in my opinion.  I'm usually stuffed after 1 slice!"}
{"text":"I remember being little and loving Eastern Canadian pizza; it's thick, loaded with cheese, tasty, and certainly not good for the thighs! This is how pizza should be and to my dismay, after living West for many years, I got used to the thin crust, vegetable laden, chain derived variety. I still miss the donair pizza of the 80s!  Moving back to Montr√©al has reminded me that this city is known for its local little mom & pop shops that add their unique stamp to their pizza. This one injects homemade Greek love into their signature dish. There's also plenty of Greek-Canadian classics: souvlaki (the chicken is so tender) and giros. They throw in poutine for good measure (because every restaurant seems to put poutine on the menu).    The best way to enjoy this pizzeria is to sit down and hangout with locals while watching a game. It can get loud and parking can be tricky, but its a great way to feel the local spirit."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok  But sub are great!! Make sure you do the upgrade to the pizza bread well worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food fair price great service from the waitress definitely i will come back .good lpcation and clean place"}
{"text":"I'm picky when it comes to my pizza, very few places get my approval. I've only tasted their cheese pizza thus far and it's great! It's packed with cheese, nice dough and great not too overpowering sauce. The chicken wings were good as well but I've tasted better (not saying these aren't good just that I've tasted better) :)  It's not the cheapest pizza place but most certainly one of my top choices in terms of quality and taste."}
{"text":"Great Pizza   more topping per Pizza then others Pizza Delivery places in my area  only issu is  closed on monday   only Pizza place i know that is fully closed 1 day a week"}
{"text":"Wow...really great. TBH..it should be 4.5..but I didn't love their fry gravy. Lol.   The west island has terrible pizza. But I searched Yelp on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.   Had the Athena..tons of toppings and excellent crust.   The girl working was so nice. It will now be my go to place!!"}
{"text":"What a gem of a restaurant ... The pizza was delish, their poutine was the BEST!  They were accommodating to my last minute reservation of 30 guests- when we're in Montreal again we will definitely stop by"}
{"text":"just tried their sub with the pizza dough instead of regular bread. pretty good flavors packed with lots of ingredients.i will try their pizzas next time.  i enjoyed it and would return,but don't think i'll have super cravings for it"}
