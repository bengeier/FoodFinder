{"text":"This was one of the better Indian takeaways my husband and I have had in Scottsdale. We had the Chicken korma, makhani, and tikka masala. One thing I will say is that whatever spiciness level you think you are, order one level below that. We love genuinely spicy food and the level \"spicy\" for the makhani and masala were straight fire, as in big chunks of jalape√±os with seeds in the currys haha. It was still great though, just a bit overpowering! The only thing that was disappointing was the garlic naan, hoping it was jut an off night because it was pretty flavorless. We'll get take away from there again."}
{"text":"My wife and I are true Indian food lovers.  In particular, we love to get Chicken Tikki Masala most every where we go.  They have the best in Phoenix.  I love to get it Hot and it is soooooo good.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in the valley that I have been to so far. I like the Chicken Korma and Vindaloo.  I have been here several times and it is consistent and good.   the bad:  they  charge for rice. On the whole, it's on the expensive side, maybe I should go for the buffet but I'm generally not a fan of buffets."}
{"text":"My wife and I keep coming back here!  Maybe it's just the convenience, but whatever the reason we're always stuffed to the gills and very happy with the food and service.  We went in recently for the Champagne brunch (buffet) and enjoyed a selection of things we hadn't tried before.  We arrived about 12:30 (on Sunday) and found about 10 other people in the restaurant.  Over the next hour, people were pouring in, large groups, families.  It appears to be a very popular buffet!  The servers were very attentive, the food was fresh and very good.  The spice level seemed pretty mild, so if you have a thing for hot-n-spicy, you'll need to order a side of hot sauce."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for dinner and take-out. Food is always excellent. My favs, Chicken Makhni, Chicken Korma, Aloo Mutter. The samosas are really good but only if eaten with the chutney and raita, otherwise it's pretty dry. My 4 stars is based on the food.  The restaurant space/decor is pretty sad. Not sure what the space used to be but there are ugly track lights on the ceiling - almost like stage lights. Walls are dark. But whatever, right? As long as the food is great. However, I did go in for the lunch buffet once, and the buffet is set up next to the bathrooms. Is it a problem? Well if you're a mental germaphobe like me, then YES it's a problem. I get that space is limited but a little remodel would really increase the dining experience."}
{"text":"I've had chicken tikka masala at different places around the country. This time it had a different, wonderful flavor. The rice was perfect, garlic naan hot crisp and chewy. I tried the mango dessert, like ice cream. Everything was delicious. Service was polite and very attentive. I didnt think you could find great Indian food in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Dal, alu and curry goat, mmmm I want to go back right now.... On the way over there I  was like, is this gonna be a regular stop because of the distance, but after yesterday I'll be going back.  We arrived when the buffet was still being served, which was cool because we got to sample a little of couple dishes... had the regular items you get at an indian buffet the tandori chicken, curry chicken but i skipped over to the goat, the tikki chicken was good and they also had the cheese version for the vegans and other vegan items as well... ordered an alu paratha of the menu, even though they brought out plain and garlic ones to the table, had to taste more :) the dal was very well season and gave me that home taste style actually all their food was season nice, not something you find at a buffet style.  The service was really good, the place was kept very clean, restroom as well."}
{"text":"Great food and GREAT staff.  Ive eaten at a lot of indian restaurants across the west coast and this wss one of the best.  The tika masla and chicken curry were great.  So was the chili chicken"}
{"text":"We hadn't had Indian food in over a year and got a craving... thanks to the reviews here, decided to give this place a try. Went for the lunch buffet on a Tuesday -- had 45 min left before they closed and there was plenty of food. Sometimes buffets tend to run out or don't replenish. Not here. I'm sure if something was low they would have accommodated. Very tasty and delicious. Tried many different items and will definitely be back. Fresh and lots of variety. Atmosphere very pleasant and the wait staff were friendly/helpful. Easy location, right next to Costco, plenty of parking, tables, food and buffet great value at $10! Try it!"}
{"text":"Worst indian food ever.  When you write a bad review, they'll petition yelp to remove it.  So it's so bad here , I'm writing again.   The tandoori chicken is not authentic tandoori. Anyone can take red food coloring and put it on baked chicken!!! All curries are prepared poorly....water and curry powder doesn't equal curry.   Guys. This place also has the nastiest restroom of a restaurant in scottsdale.  Stay away."}
{"text":"i loved the food very much. i had aloo-baigan (potato, eggplant) curry and garlic nan. the food quantity was generous and i ended up packing some for home. but i think the price was too high.  overall great experience."}
{"text":"best Indian food I have had to date in Scottsdale, solid place."}
{"text":"I just eat there today. The food is OK, I had food from their lunch buffet. The place needs to be cleaned! The floors are black, the air conditioning vents are falling apart (you cannot see that because they have dropped the reflectors lower from the ceiling and painted the ceiling elements black, so unless you really look you cannot see), check out the chandelier in the place, filthy! I saw a tinny bug walk over the buffet foods while I was helping myself. I am not a picky person, but I will never go there again. There are much better Indian food places around."}
{"text":"Best Indian food we have found in the Phoenix Metro area. We live in Yuma AZ & we come here almost every time we come to the area. Never had a bad meal here either from the buffet or evenings off the menu. Always quality."}
{"text":"I ate here for dinner. The food was good. The staff was attentive but the food was a bit expensive. I plan to go back and try the buffet."}
{"text":"Sweet buffet deal, not the most amazing food but decent. Mango lassi comes part of the buffet which is great and you get a champagne/soda included too. My top pick would be the samosa and chicken tikka curry. Flavorful and worth a 2nd/3rd round."}
{"text":"We went there after a long hike and were craving for a good indian food .. This place was truly that.. For )$12 per person all you can eat also included a glass of champagne .. Which was new to me from a indian buffet.. Food was amazing ."}
{"text":"Host is very friendly. Food portions are so big and you can actually share between two or three people. Sure Try it."}
{"text":"Horrible food and super expensive! This place should change or shutdown!"}
{"text":"Oh what sadness the day that this restaurant decided to move their business to the North Scottsdale branch.  We always used to order Indian food from Indian paradise Chandler because they made delicious naan, basmati rice and all things Indian curry. For what it's worth - go check out the Scottsdale branch if you are in the area.  I have yet to go but I promised myself that I will put in a good word for this restaurant once I open my Yelp account.  Living in Chandler I know that I will be going to the Scottsdale branch as soon as I have reason to go in that direction."}
{"text":"Given the scarcity of good ethnic options in the North Scottsdale area, Indian Paradise deserves another star.  We've been on an ethnic binge this week and decided to check out the buffet lunch again.    The garlic naan was brought hot to the table and refilled when our basket went empty.  It had a great crispy charred exterior.  The tandoori chicken tasted brined which probably contributed to the tenderness.  Pretty good selection of veg options like veg korma (mild creamy sauce), dal makhani (lentils), chana masala (chickpeas) and saag (spinach) with potatoes.  All in all a great value and we look forward to coming back for the weekend champagne brunch which is priced at $11.95 and includes one drink.  Buffet offering is also supposed to be more extensive.  Don't forget to grab a bag of crispy spiced snacks on the way out.  They're better than chips and very addictive."}
{"text":"great food great service, love this place !!! try the buffet where you get a good variety."}
{"text":"My love affair with Indian cuisine started about 20 years ago, when in medical school with friends from India. Both North and South India. I learned the difference and also saw that the 20 somethings, male and female knew how to cook a whole meal with the spices they brought from India in the little metal caddie with individual spice cups. They even brought the Basmati rice from home with a rice cooker! I fell in love with the food and the guy ( but that's an other story). Although this place was not great before, it was as close as we're going to get to Indian food in Scottsdale. I've been going for the last couple of years and today I went back after a few months absence and it was just Not the same. The taste, the spices ( not the hotness ) was not the same at all! I have a feeling they changed owners, as even the service was bad. Other friends have also commented that the food quality is bad now, and I for one will not be going back.  The rice was dry and taste severely missing, even the cardamom Pods were missing. I had the curry and my companion the tikka masala and the tikka just tasted like tomato paste, and the curry was tasteless.   Very disappointing !! I soo wished this could last.  The 3 stars is for my previous experience.  Anyone know if the owners are the same or have they sold the place and moved back to the mother land??"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Indian restaurants in Arizona . Very good food, very good service. Their Goat curry is so very yummy and the staff is always so friendly. If you are unfamilar with Indian cuisine then would recommend going to the lunch buffet to sample a variety of dishes. The prices are also reasonable."}
{"text":"The food is very very good with the staff and owners are very rude and make you feel very uncomfortable about how much are eating at a all you can eat buffet. There are other professors around you can go to that are just as good as I would recommend them over this"}
{"text":"What I said in my last review... Still not very busy though so those of you in the airpark for lunch or just want to make a trip to have a good dinner. Make sure you stop by here and get some good Indian food.  Tandoori chicken and the Chicken curry are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? I went to this place for lunch last week as I was waiting for my appointment with the no so genius staff at the Genius Bar at the Apple store down the road.... Thats another story... But I digress.... Anywho, This place absolutely sucks... Indian buffet scares me anyway, but this place takes it to a whole new level....The Naan was dry, the was a choice of almost nothing in the buffet... I almost walked out, but since I was there and wanted to review, I couldn't accomplish my mission without taking my life in my hands and trying it.... Good news, I'm still alive.... Bad news is, I am losing faith that good indian food exists in the valley"}
{"text":"Over the last three years we've tried at least a dozen different Phoenix-area Indian restaurants.  Indian Paradise is easily the best around and as good as we've had in any other city.    We've eaten here dozens of times for dinner, and a couple times for the lunch buffet.  The dinner is much better than the buffet, it tastes fresher and they do a great job of cooking to the requested spice level.    I love the Rogan Josh and get it almost every time.  Also good are the Chicken Korma and Chicken Tikka Masala.  Make sure you order Naan for dipping in the curry."}
{"text":"We were there for lunch today, but had a very poor experience. The food was not fresh, Naan was not baked well, and the service was below average. Won't be going again.."}
{"text":"The environment was nice. Good location. The food....I had to fill my stomach with something healthy. Thats it. The okra vegetable that my husband and I got was 1/4 portion of okra, 1/2 portion of onions and 1/2 portion of ginger. I was getting pcs of ginger in every bite which I just didnt like. We ordered a roti each with it and rice came along with the okra. We didnt bother to finish the veggie."}
{"text":"Great food but not much of it.  I ordered Lamb Vindaloo for about $15 and there were only about 6 pieces of lamb - excellent taste but mostly sauce"}
{"text":"We got takeout from Indian Paradise through Eat24, and had a good experience.  We got the chicken Tikka Masala (ordered it extra Spicey), and it was fantastic!  My wife has q new go-to takeout dish, and I agreed that it was top notch.  We also ordered lamb madras, which we thought was decent, though my wife didn't love the lamb meat.  I thought the madras sauce was good, but paled in comparison to the tikka masala.  We also got some tandoori chicken which was very good, and a super generous portion.  The portion sizes were all generous, and they give you more than enough rice on the side with your order.  The last thing that we ordered was garlic naan and green chili naan, both of which were below average for Naan (I've had a lot of phenomenal Naan, so I'm a bit biased), and this is one place that we both thought they could do a bit better.  Overall, we had a good experience, and loved our dinner, and the yummy leftovers the next day.  We'll be headed back again in the future for the Tikka Masala alone :)"}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times.  Not only is the food delicious but their buffet dishes and serving area is very clean!  I was completely shocked to find the dishes spotless and not wet.  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Great people, delicious food. Some of the best Indian I've had in the valley. I've come for the lunch buffet and regular dinner service and have been impressed each time I've been here. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great lamb korma and rogan josh.  Showed up right at 5 and was done with dinner quickly with good service!"}
{"text":"The service is excellent and the food! If you like Indian food I highly recommend you try Indian Paradise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Indian Paradise has a solid lunch buffet. At $11.95 maybe a little more expensive than usual for a buffet but it's in North Scottsdale so not completely unexpected either. Nice interior and even looks like the patio could be a pleasant dining experience when there's nice weather, surprising considering that the restaurant is located in a fairly bland, out of the way strip mall.  The food was very tasty and will certainly sate your desire for Indian. Comparatively, it was middle of the road as far as the Indian food I've had--not the best but not the worst. But if you love Indian food like I do, you won't be disappointed. The lunch buffet has a lot of the standard dishes: chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, aloo matter, palak paneer, tandoori chicken, etc. Tikka masala is usually my favorite but theirs was just ok. I really liked their chicken curry and aloo matar.  Service was good; everyone was friendly and attentive.  Also, don't panic when you don't see the naan at the buffet like I did. They bring you your own basket. :)"}
{"text":"The food here today at the buffet was abysmal. There were no plates or cups. There was no mint chutney. The garlic non-was undercooked with no garlic. I wish I had ate at Burger King instead and I hate them."}
{"text":"Not easy to find but worth the effort. Simple surroundings but great curry. Try the coconut chicken....its outstanding."}
{"text":"Flipping amzing .The food is cooked right in front of you . I tried the veggie samosas and they were really good they were as big as your fist and a little spice."}
{"text":"I am currently working in Scottsdale and decide to have some Indian. I was not disappointed food was good service was good and a wide selection of buffet options. I will definitely make it a point to come back."}
{"text":"Very good meal -- a la carte dinner. And service above and beyond. Must go back for the buffet."}
{"text":"Food,staff & service all very very poor.interiors very depressing.u are better of cooking Indian food at home it will turn out better than anything served at this place"}
{"text":"Found this by accident and love it. It's our go to for Indian food! My hubs is a foodie and he loves it."}
{"text":"'Unhygienic' is the word I can use for this restaurant. Almost all the dishes they had were dirty. Then my friend found a human hair in chicken curry. After complaining to manager the owner came, apologized once and thats it. Then I went to have salad and found alive cockroach crawling on food containers. On complaining to the owner she said 'The cockroach wasn't big sir' . Wow does that really matter if it was big or not. Second statement from her was 'Sir it happens in all restaurant and not just here. Really! she was trying to justify everything. While I was still talking to her, she started attending another customer, now this is unprofessional. Am surely not going to this place again."}
{"text":"Coming from a place and age where the most exotic ethnic food was considered to be Taco Time, I have spent  many years experimenting with all kinds of different foods.  One of my favorites is Indian food, and thanks to Microsoft and other tech companies, who use workers from India,  there are many more Indian restaurants now scattered throughout the country.  I am not an expert on the food (in fact, until recently, I never understood why Bollywood movies were always playing in Indian restaurants).  But I do enjoy it, and try every Indian restaurant I can find.  I started going to Indian Paradise several years ago, and loved it.  It has a nice interior, and the servers are very nice and helpful.  I always seem to come in the early evening, before they are busy, and I always feel somewhat spoiled the way they treat me.  I love their masalas, curry, and naan, and have, of course, tried all of their Indian beers. I also find the different tandoori dishes delicious.  I might note that I have never made it to the lunch buffet - I always seem to be golfing at that time so I'm just never in the area .  But it is on my list of things to do.  ***Bollywood - Bollywood is the name given to the Mumbai-based Hindi-language film industry in India.The term Bollywood was created by conflating Bombay (the city now called Mumbai) and Hollywood. Bollywood films are usually musicals. Few movies are made without at least one song-and-dance number. Indian audiences expect full value for their money; they want songs and dances, love interest, comedy and dare-devil thrills, all mixed up in a three hour long extravaganza with intermission."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving Indian food. Coming from Japan where there is an abundant amount of exquisite Indian restaurants and seeing such great reviews, we were excited to go. It was \"ok\" which was a disappointment. The service was good, but the Nan....flat and sticky, curry was cold...didn't seem fresh at all. And the buffet style for lunch was an additional \"no\" sorry to say..."}
{"text":"Very good choice. We ordered 5 dishes all vegetarian plus naan. Quick service and quite attentive. Normally we get mild but this was on the hotter side. Fresh ingredients and would recommend for a lower cost meal than other places near Kierland."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to Scottsdale from Chicago. One of the things we missed most (even after a few weeks) was the amazing quality ethnic food.  We are big fans of Indian cuisine. It is our go-to comfort food when we return from a long trip and need something warm, spicy and complex.  We each had a craving on Saturday night and gave Indian Paradise a try.  We ordered carry out and they recommended a comparable lamb dish to my favorite dish at our Chicago place. So I had the Rogan Josh and my husband went with his favorite Tikka Masala, naan and samosa.  Everything was delicious! We are so excited to be able to have our new Indian place here in Arizona. I cannot wait to try their vegetarian options next time."}
{"text":"We come here often for work and always have a positive experience. The food is consistently good and the staff are always present and checking in."}
{"text":"Been to Indian paradise a few times since moving to Scottsdale in September. Tried a few different Indian restaurants but this is the best around.   I've only had dinner here so far. The service is always fast and on point, very authentic cuisine. I've been eating Indian cuisine all my life and this spot is on point with the best I've had.   Chicken Tikka Masala, any type of naan, mango lassi, nuff said."}
{"text":"I have only been here for the lunch buffet, which, at $8.99 is a steal. Seriously, this place is great. It tends towards to more traditional, heavier north indian cuisine, but all of it is done to perfection. The na'an is wonderfully cooked and always plentiful. This place is also great because it offers a wide selection of vegetarian options. A little off the beaten path, but worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Read a review on Yelp that led me to taking a chance for my wife's birthday dinner. INCREDIBLE! The food and friendly service is what we will definitely be back for soon. I recommend it for Indian cuisine regulars and novices alike. They have a great selection on the menu for everyone. My kids even loved it!"}
{"text":"Best indian restaurant in Scottsdale!! Love the food and the service, been here many times will definitely return! Thanks again for a taste of paradise"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to the restaurant,  and was a complete letdown.  While the spread was substantial,  the fare was insipid,  at best.  The naan was probably the best of what was served.  The paneer tikka masala and the Palak paneer were very ordinary (the cubes of paneer weren't all that fresh either).  The dal makhni seemed like it had been watered down,  while a mix of cabbage and potato seemed too oily to try.   I completed my meal with the mango lassi. While the lassi tasted just about right,  the underlying dairy hinted at being close to curdled.   Overall,  lunch here wasn't enjoyable and I would abstain from visiting in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered Lamb Biryani and Palak Paneer for take out.  The food was ready when I arrived (promot service) and the place appeared fairly clean.  The problem was that the food was bland.  The Palak Paneer (my usual favorite when ordering Indian) could only be described as nasty.  3/18/2012 - Update:   have been many times since my original visit and the food is much, much better.  I'm glad I did not give up on this place.   The buffet is a regular lunch stop now; well done."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with my wife and daughter.  Food was great and the owners/staff were very attentive.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Scottsdale awesome buffet, tomato soup always spicy, they keep bringing you fresh made naan, definitely recommend if you wanna get full"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I know of.  I order takeout from this place about twice a month, and have been for like 3 years.  I almost always order very near closing, and they are always happy to take the order.    I know it's kind of dickish to place an order late, but I can't help being annoyed when I call at 9:30 to a place that closes at 10:00 and the \"kitchen is closed\".  That's not how these guys roll.    Consistently great food and great service."}
{"text":"Normally I am a big fan of Indian food. I cannot claim to be an expert but I have tried a variety of Indian food and I am familiar with the taste and how great the food can taste,. We were in the restaurant at about 5 pm when it opened. They were not busy at the time only 2 other customers were present. Food was kind of bland and tasteless. I had the seekh kebab. Was somewhat dry and no taste. The other dish we had was eggplant, also not great, not spicy, and too oily. They forgot to bring the rice and the naan and had to ask twice. Don't like to write negative reviews but this was pretty bad and not very clean either."}
{"text":"First time at this wonderful restaurant.  I immediately observed that they constantly have been rated A by the Maricopa Health Drpartment!  Thus I knew I was about to have a great lunch. The food is fresh and delicately seasoned with an array of Indian spices.  Indian Paradise does not cater to the every day American crowd.  Instead, it offers a variety of traditional Indian dishes and each one has its distinctive flavor. The coconut flavored rice is an excellent addition to any chicken, fish or lamb dish.  The menu offers diverse vegetarian dishes and free Mango  The service is great and extremely attentive I will definitely come back next time I am in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 4 times, all for the buffet and all were good.  Their Tandoori is decent, they always have some varied vegetable selections and the Tikka is pretty good for a buffet.  They have a varied selection and the staff are always friendly and helpful  I like that you can get garlic naan with the buffet.  I have nto yet ordered off the menu there...."}
{"text":"The mango lassi could've been better.  The malai kofta had a slight ketchup taste. The kofta balls could've been better. But it was okay overall.  The naan bread basket was good.  Most Indian restaurants give complimentary pappad while we wait (just like the Italian ones give Ciabatta bread) but we weren't offered any pappad here.  Ambiance was fine."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good Indian buffet and found it. The place is a hidden treasure. The food was delicious and buffet had a good variety. Good service great food and pretty good price. Chicken curry was my favorite and the basmati rice was delicious."}
{"text":"Another perfect lunch buffet. I think this restaurant could prevent suicides. If you die, you can't experience this food again. And you DO want to experience this food again. .....and again......"}
{"text":"We went there for a buffet over the weekend and they had a private event going on which very conveniently took over the entire restaurant! To top the noise and chaos, the food was horrible. I am vegetarian so can rate that food which was pathetic but I was with meat eaters and they didn't have much to say either.   If there was a rating less than 1 star, I would give that..."}
{"text":"Bit too expensive. Their buffet is good, better value than ordering individual entrees. Disappointed with their desserts or lack of it on the buffets. Unfortunately they seem to be the only Indian restaurant around North scottsdale. Good for them, they may survive."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Indian restaurant in AZ. I've never had a bad meal here. And the service is exceptional. Be sure to come hungry. My husband and I always order extra naan to scrape off the leftover curry that we weren't able to get into the to go box... we'd use our fingers if it weren't impolite. Letting it go to waste isn't an option. It's so good!   The goat curry is delicious, but there are bones in it. I highly recommend anything with lamb... you can't fail with the lamb curry or lamb coconut curry. I like the chicken makni, butter chicken, but usually get the lamb. Be sure to leave room for the rice pudding and the gulab jamun. I like to combine the two, so damn delicious."}
{"text":"Having worked in the Scottsdale Airpark area going on 9 years or so, I've eaten lunch just about everywhere. There are plenty of good places, but not many ethnic places... Indian Paradise has the distinction of being both great and ethnic. I've only ever eaten there for the lunch buffet, and it is AMAZING!  I keep thinking that I'm gonna be disappointed, eventually... But every single time I have dined here I have come away extremely satisfied and in dire need of a nap. I keep asking myself, how can it be so good? Is it cocaine? Cocaine in the food?! Is it?!  They have different buffet items on different days, but the the mainstay curry chicken remains a favorite of mine. On Friday there is a mushroom dish that I dream about... and on Thursday they have stuffed jalapenos that are a little hot but oh so gooooooood!  Be sure to save some room for the rice pudding, 'cause it's delicious."}
{"text":"I always love being pleasantly surprised. I love driving to Scottsdale Airpark for Indian food, expecting nothing special (as to not get my hopes up) and being very pleasantly surprised.   Mr. Hottie was coming into town and I had Erin and Ayesha rounded up for dinner at another venue. Well, Mr. Hottie throws me a curve ball by texting me during a layover to state \"I'm craving Indian food.\" I think to myself \"Keep cool chica, sure you can find a good spot on last minute's notice!\" So I hop on Yelp and try to find a good Indian joint that is NOT located in the East Valley. Yay! Indian Palace pops up on my search. Suh-weet! So I alert my girls of the venue change and off we go!   When we arrived at the strip mall location, and walked in, I noticed how big the place was! It reminded me of a big warehouse that was converted into a restaurant. I was also hit with the smell of spices and gravies which was actually impressive because this was on the eve of the complete loss of my sense of smell and taste due to a terrible cold.   The menu for dinner was quite large. I chose the Chicken Tikka Masala (my fave) while my dinner partners chose a few other dishes. Everything was delicious and made to order. I ordered my masala medium, while Ayesha ordered hers spicy and it seemed to come out as ordered. The one draw back that I had with this place is that they charge for rice to go with your meal, but we soon got over it and enjoyed our wonderful meal!   I returned with Ayesha on a Sunday to try their lunch buffet. It was very good and large! For about 12 bucks, you had a choice of about 10-15 dishes, rice, naan, and a drink (champagne was an option for Sunday). On that day there was a very large birthday party being seated and I think they sat about 30-40 people with more revelers coming in the door. So, the restaurant is no small cafe, for sure!   Indian Paradise is the place to go if you don't want to drive to Arizona's \"Silicon Valley\" (Chandler/Ahwatukee area). Their food is flavorful, and delicious. I look forward to trying them again very soon!"}
{"text":"I've had Indian food three times in my life. All three were awful experiences and I swore it off.  I do like chicken vindaloo and had a hankering for it tonight.  So I gave this place a shot. It has redeemed Indian food as a whole! The chicken vindaloo was amazing.   Also had the tandoori chicken, chicken tikka Masala, raita, and paneer pakora.  The only thing I didn't like was the pakora. Everything was great! Oh and the garlic naan.   Make sure to order two!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere amazing service as well...had the makhni chicken highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hello Followers:  I am writing regarding out second visit to Indian Paradise Restaurant today, June 5th.  Because, having good food once somewhere is not a good judge of a restaurant's ability to deliver consistent quality food you can expect at each visit.  I am writing again regarding the weekend buffet.  It appears from our visit today that the buffet varies slightly from time to time.  Positives:  The condiments you get with naan (raita, chutneys, etcetera) are on the buffet so you can help yourself in small bowls to the items you want to have with your food. Naan is included with the buffet.  The first time we had the garlic naan.  This time we had the plain naan.  We found the garlic naan to be better.  The plain naan today was a bit dry and crumbly and was not hot.  Therefore, it was a disappointment compared to our last visit. The mango/yogurt drink was luke warm as opposed to our first visit when it was nice and cold.  It tasted the same, but having this drink cold as opposed to room temperature makes all the difference. The first time at the restaurant we were asked if we would like more naan.  This time it was not offered.  We overheard several tables asking for more naan, so it appears it was the wait staff this time who was not as efficient as the first time we went. Items on the buffet (from noon to three on Sundays) needed to be filled when we arrived.  The chicken curry has a wonderfully rich sauce (same as last time) and the chicken was tender. The lentil dish was far too runny for our taste. The fried potatoes had been sitting out in the chafing dish for too long and should have been dumped and replaced with an entirely new, crunchy batch. The sliced oranges were nice and cold and very sweet as were the white fresh onions. The fresh tomatoes were nice and ripe, but the fresh cucumbers had huge seeds in them and should have either been cored or not served. The chicken masala was very good, again with a rich spicy sauce. The tandoor chicken was very dry compared to our last visit.  My husband and I both agreed it had been cooked too long.  We tried several pieces and they were all dry and hard to cut. Rice is plentiful in a very large rice cooker and you help yourself.  Negative:  It appears the quality of the food and service to your table all depend on who is cooking that day or night and who is designed to wait tables that day or night, which creates inconsistency with regard to expectations."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I'm not a huge fan of Indian food -- however; I do like the food here. The atmosphere is elegant and quiet and the menu has a great variety to it. There are also Indian music videos playing in the background with beautiful men and women wearing every color known to man. The chicken tikka masala was delish and I could live off of the garlic naan for a few days at least."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in the valley!  We moved here 6 years ago and never found an Indian restaurant we liked until this place. Now we are regulars."}
{"text":"Given the propensity of chain restaurants in the area, it's refreshing to have something a little different and a lot delicious for a quick lunch in the Airpark area.   The lunch buffet at $8.99 is reasonable, and the offerings actually change on a daily basis.   The service is a little lackluster, but it's a lunch buffet so I'm not looking for someone to attend to my every whim when I can pretty much handle myself.    I've never seen this restaurant hurting for lunch customers; mainly Indian.  Try the Saag; even if you're not a spinach fan it's creamy, spiced just enough, and is a great invitation for you to use it to finish up every last bite of the fresh naan."}
{"text":"We went for lunch buffet today from work and we are not satisfied with the taste and also they have very limited veg options . However three stars are for thier mango lassi. I dont recommend this place if you are looking for huge variety in the buffet. Biryani I felt overcooked and overall I have a ok experience."}
{"text":"Very average Indian Restaurant.  The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything memorable either.  Food over all was a little bland.  There August pricing is discounted, for $9, it's not a bad deal.  I wouldn't pay their normal price though.  Service was also just average.  Naan came out quickly, but was very dry, needed some oil or salt.  Tasted very stale .  Plates were also not cleared off the table right away.  Only after I had 3-4 plates piled high would anyone come around to collect the plates.  I'll give them another try, maybe the food was just an off day.  WIll update if the food quality gets better."}
{"text":"I had to update my review because my family and I had dinner last night and the food WAS NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING.  Goat Curry, Paratha bread, Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken biriyani, and spinach.  EVERYTHING WAS GREAT.  Tasty and spiced to the level we requested.   The service was great.  They fill the water and checked on us to make sure everything was right.   This is a place you will get your indian food fix and totally enjoy it.   Go NOW! -------------------  February 4, 2017-------------------------------- Another amazing, delicious meal with the most friendly and on-point service that anyone can imagine.  Nice portions, wonderfully seasoned food, attractive environment, white tablecloths and napkins, accommodating service. What a great place!   I can't say enough and everyone should come out to Indian Paradise to confirm what I am saying.    (BTW, not related to the company in any way. I just want to make sure this place gets to stay in business so that I can continue to enjoy this gem of a restaurant.)"}
{"text":"Picked this place based on Yelp reviews while in Scottsdale on a business trip.  I ordered Chicken Korma, Chicken Pekora and Naan and brought it back to my hotel room.  It was fantastic.  The korma had a nice thick, creamy sauce and the chicken was tender.  I've never had chicken pekora before, and it was delicious as well.  The restaurant decor is nicer than you'd expect from a strip mall restaurant, but certainly nothing fancy. They have a lunch buffet 7 days a week which I would love to try.  A great find in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"When I am in the mood for some truly comforting food, I head to Indian Paradise for some chicken tikka masala... and that's exactly what I did this past weekend.  For about 4 years my Husband and I have been frequenting this establishment and after our most recent visit this past weekend I feel compelled to write a review.  First of all, as other people have said, the prices here are high, and possibly not 100% worth the portion size, however, I still go back time and time again and I'll tell you why, the food and service.  We ALWAYS get the chicken tikka masala and it is true comfort in a bowl.  That sauce combined with some garlic naan can cure any issue you may be having in your life... well, for at least a little while maybe.  The papadum and chutney that they give you before the mean is great.  We've had the samosas, which are fried goodness and very flavorful.  Lastly, this past time we had the tandoori shrimp, which was surprisingly awesome... the veggies were cooked perfectly and the shrimp was seasoned well and the lemon was a nice touch.  If you haven't had Indian food, you must try it, and if you haven't gone to Indian Paradise, please do.  We pay the high prices because we don't want to see this gem disappear like so many other restaurants.  This Mom and Pop shop has stayed in business due to their great tentative service and excellent food... so GO!"}
{"text":"Meh. The food was pretty ok. Not good not bad. Tried the goat biryani and paneer tikka masala.  Biryani was good, paneer was not. The paneer was frozen and looked like it was just thrown into the curry and boiled once or twice.  There are many better Indian places in Phoenix (and some worse :))"}
{"text":"I came here after consulting Yelp about where to eat for lunch, I decided on this Indian restaurant. Sorta hidden in a plaza among  a buncha of business building, it has a clean and decorative interior.   I went for their lunch buffet which is $10/person. The buffet consisted of 3-4 meat curries an 3-4 vegetarian curries with about 5-6 side dishes (samosas, veggies, etc). There's enough rice and naan to go around!  The service was okay, as long as you aren't afraid to flag someone down and at 12noon the place was about half full, so not too crowded.  The actual dishes were yum! Pretty tasty, yummy, but a bit heavy. Usually I can fit 2 rounds of foods in my bell-ay, but this time I couldn't even get myself to finish my second plate. And as usual, I shed a tear because there was leftover Indian food on my plate that I couldn't fit in my stomach. *cry*!!"}
{"text":"I have visited Indian Paradise on several more occasions since my first visit. The food remains very good as well as the service. Prices have gone up a bit but is still good value for the money. Try the lunch time buffet - great variety and the food is fresh and well priced."}
{"text":"Oh Dear!  I was so wanting to like this place - close to my home, with a 'no fuss' appearance.  And the Cricket (on the big-screen TV) was quite a fun surprise.   The place could use a bit of help on the 'atmosphere' front ... I think for the whole time of my meal, there was some non-descript sitar music playing in the background, and some of the staff looked like their mother had just died ... but I could live with that if the food were ok.   I ordered Lamb Vindaloo.  It was awful. Vindaloo is notorious for being hot (spicy hot), so when I order it, I don't mind if the waiter verifies I want it hot, but if they don't ask (they didn't this time) I expect to have a mouth-burning experience.  It was utterly bland.  Not only was it bland, but it was lacking in any of the 'vinegar' flavor I've experienced with all the Vindaloo's I've had elsewhere.  My other dish was ok, and the papadums were good, and the rice and Naan bread were good, so I won't go below 3 stars but - quite frankly, my meal wasn't a 3 star meal."}
{"text":"This is the only Indian buffet (lunch only) in the north Scottsdale area. I ate here on the weekend for lunch.  There was a steady stream of customers and there is a large number of employees working here.  The service is fast (refilling drinks, bringing more bread, clearing plates, and bringing check) and the employees are extremely helpful and friendly.    There was a good variety of Indian dishes. However I found that the food in the heating trays at the buffet was room temperature, none were even near warm or a decent temperature which effected the palatability as well as offering possible food safety concerns. The mango lassi was not cold (it was room temperature) and most likely had been sitting at the buffet table for a few hours which again causes concern for the safety of consumption.    I was also hoping there would be a few more dessert choices. They only had rice pudding and a mango pudding dessert when I went. I should also mention that the Indian food here is mild on the spice level and there is not a pungent smell to the restaurant or to the food so you can still safely go to public places after eating here.   Overall I will not go back but would still recommend it to others that live in the area as it is the only Indian buffet in the area."}
{"text":"Avoid the buffet  if you don't want to feel heavy the whole day, little overpriced"}
{"text":"Aaaahhhh. It's SO GOOD. I truly appreciate a good masala sauce. It's one of my favorite things, and this place makes it spot on perfectly. It had a mild spiciness to it which was a welcomed treat because I've had some watered down masala sauces here in North Scottsdale...This masala wasn't super spicy hot, but just had a nice mild kick to it. Very tasty. Rice was plentiful. I ordered and extra rice just in case, but what comes with the meal is plenty, even for leftovers. There wasn't a ton of chicken in my masala sauce, but I guess enough to get by and have a couple pieces leftover for later.  We also ordered the chicken biryani and it was excellent! It's Hubby's favorite when we eat Indian and this was really good he said. Had nice a decent amount of spiciness to it (way too much for me in one meal) he loved it. We also had a butter naan and a plain naan. I LOVE me some NAAN! And theirs was thin, light, and yummy. Definitely recommend the butter naan. Great job guys! You've gained a loyal customer :)"}
{"text":"We were shopping for hardwood floors and our last stop was Arizona Wholesale Supply. We were starving and noticed the Indian Restaurant right next door, so headed in. The waitress sat us down and got us some water. There was no mention of \"Would you like the buffet or menu?\" So we were extremely confused on what to do next. I actually walked over to the hostess desk and grabbed a couple of menus and that is when we figured out the buffet option and the lunch options, and the prices. We went for the buffet and was pleasantly surprised. The food was fresh and delicious. I am not a buffet person, but glad I chose that option! The tandoori chicken was juicy and the fried appetizers were crispy. They also served unlimited naan which was a pleasant surprise. I would have given it 5 stars, but I think the service could have been more in tune with their customers."}
{"text":"On Christmas day, this restaurant was open. I was in the Scottsdale area and had to order a starter.I ordered chicken tikka TO-GO. After picking up Chicken Tikka - The appetizer, when I opened it at home I was highly dissapointed It was just some steamed chicken with sauteed onions and red color mixed in it. I think The cook or chef who prepared it has no clue as to what Chicken Tikka is . Moreover it had too much salt in it and really uneatable. I was charged a hefty $15.01 for this pathetic dish. Will never go in here again."}
{"text":"I came here earlier. That time it was good.but today I had a really bad experience. There are no spices in food, no variety, chicken Tikka smells awkward. Very bad experience I have ever had with indian food.plz change ur cook."}
{"text":"Who knew there was good Indian food in Arizona!!!!!!   Indian Paradise is a wonderful little restaurant that serve great food. Yes, it is not something you'd find in London, LA, or NYC, worth stopping in for a taste!   Their buffet does not have a lot of spicy food, but it's fresh and good. At $11 it's not a bad deal!    I'm a new fan and look forward to trying it for dinner. Oh yeah, the Naan is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Good quality Indian Restaurant. Clean and fairly quick service. The portion size is good. I ordered the chicken Tikka masala and the tate was great and texture perfect. I will be back."}
{"text":"We order takeout on a regular basis. Quality is good  and food is consistent. Vegan and vegetarian options are available."}
{"text":"Yum! Dottsy, Mike and Ayesha included me on an Indian run last Thursday and I'm soooo glad we tried Indian Paradise. It is forever away (okay maybe only 12 miles from my place) but I was up by Hayden anyway.  At 7PM on a Thursday there were only half a dozen other diners sprinkled around the fairly sparse room. I have to say it seems a bit cavernous and light on the decor. Whatever, I'm there to EAT, not to redecorate, so let's get to the main event.   We started with Pakora, which were different looking from the pakora I've had before, tasted fine though. I ordered the Mutter....Mutter...crap I can't remember the name. It was mushrooms and peas in a creamy delicious sauce. I have never seen it before and it was so good I didn't want to share. I also had yellow lentil soup which was decent, and I managed to try the Dal Mahkani (christ I'm bad with names), and the Cauliflower and pea dish. All very standard Indian dishes, familiar by taste if not by name (clearly...)  and all executed classically.  As I tucked into these delights I realized it has been such a long time since I last had Indian food and now that I'm typing this a week later I realize I'm craving it again.   Our server was very polite and just attentive enough and the food came out really quickly which was great because I wanted to eat my fist at that point. I have to say that the prices were great, because I didn't pay. Thanks Mike! But I had noticed very reasonable price tags on the menu so this will be my go-to place for solid Indian from now on."}
{"text":"This is easy the best Indian food in town. Couple that with very friendly service and add in a pinch of reasonable prices and you have Indian Paradise. Oh almost forgot one of my favorite parts, Cricket on the big screen"}
{"text":"Wow.  This place was delicious, the ambiance felt authentic and our waiter seemed to emanate \"The Heart of India\" that of which I have often heard.  My wife and I were in search of food on a late Monday night and we found Indian Paradise on Yelp.  We ordered the Chicken Madras, Palak Paneer, and Garlic Naan and I liked it so much I found myself eating too quickly and wishing I could fit more in my stomach!  The naan was among the best I've had and the ingredients in the Chicken Madras were savory and delicious.  My wife, who spent months in India, said she was immediately harkened back.  Overall, I love Indian food and I loved Indian Paradise.  I humbly offer my 5 stars in thanks for their sumptuous meal."}
{"text":"This Indian food is just delicious! I like that they had several vegetarian options for dinners. I do wish the entrees came with more rice Tho as I had more than half my entree left when the rice was gone! Like most Indian restaurants, the ventilation is not good enough to rinse the air of the spices. This restaurant is no different so come prepared to smell like what you ate and allow for adequate time to go home and shower off the smell and do a load of laundry as to not offend anyone who isn't open to ethnic food! The smell is quite strong and tends to linger long after the meal, especially from this restaurant. Luckily Tho, this restaurant has a small outdoor patio so you can eat without smelling like Indian food afterwards! So that earns another star!! The waiter even came and threw a nice tablecloth over the table for me. It does get dark on the patio at night tho. But they were great and did not forget about me out there! I would return again if in the area again!"}
{"text":"Decent value and quick service. The selections were limited to chicken and vegetarian (no lamb or beef) but everything was flavorful. The naan was hot and served perfectly fried. The only complaints are the server pans don't keep the buffet items hot enough and the seating is getting pretty worn in many of the booths.  The dessert items didn't include some of the standards but I am not a dessert person after a filling buffet."}
{"text":"I'm very impressed by this place, before I give it 5 stars though, I would like to try more of their food.  I had the Beghan Aloo, it's potatoes and eggplant with spices.  It was incredibly good, but also drenched in ghee (not necessarily a bad thing).  I also had the rasmalai, which if you've read any of my reviews of indian restaurants, is my favorite dessert EVER.  It was only okay here, not quite the best i've ever had.  The service was really good.  It's a pretty bare bones restaurant, with a little bit of ambiance, but I don't really care much for that, the one sample dish I had here was pretty darn good, I will definitely be coming back to check out the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Love this place.  GREAT food (curry chicken is amazing) and a fast way to get an amazing lunch at a good price.  I meet my husband here for lunch at least every other week or more.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Don't miss this gem! The buffet has a great selection of vegetarian and meat dishes and they're all delicious! The menu items look great but I haven't made it past the buffet yet. I've been here twice and I'm sure I'll be back for more. A nice family run restaurant serving something a bit  different from all the chain restaurants in the area and at great prices.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"We have been to many Indian restaurants over the year but this place is a top contender!  You can tell that they use very quality ingredients and know how to cook chicken tikka masala and rogan josh to a perfection. We surely recommend!"}
{"text":"We loved our meal at this Indian paradise. Fresh food with wonderful blending of spices, with thoughtful attentive service."}
{"text":"I've seen this place on my way to Costco and always wanted to try it. After my amazing facial at Kohler Academy I decided to stop in solo for lunch. It was about 12:30 and the place was pretty crowded. I ordered an ice tea and decided to go for the buffet. Everything looked and smelled delightful so I followed the other diners down the line-o-goodness.   OMG i LOVE this place! From the tomato soup that I started with I knew I was in for a good ride. I pulled a piece of naan into pieces and dropped in into the soup while it cooled off a bit and then dug in and really didnt want it to end! I'm not even that crazy about tomato soup, but this was tops!  Next I got some rice and ladled some chicken curry and chick tikka masala over it. Then I went straight for the palek paneer (?) spinich stuff. After adding mint, tamarind and yogurt sauce on the side, my plate was full. Back at the table I dug in and was so damn happy with everything I couldn't help but smile (love that feeling!!). Both chicken dishes were so tender and flavorful and the spinach was so good that after the first bite I knew I was gonna get more.   Round two I decided to try the veggies. I got more spinach (natch) and also the peas with homemade cheese ( thats what it said on the sign, I dont remember the Indian name) and the chana masala-a garbanzo bean dish. Holy Buddha it was all so incredible that I wished I had someone there to gush to. I could barely finish everything from being so stuffed, but somehow I managed. I guessed to myself how much the check would be- 19, 20 bucks maybe? Try $12.85!!!!!!! I can't wait to bring my bf back here! This is one of my new fav's!!"}
{"text":"Good Food. Quiet setting.  I have eaten lunch buffet twice here. The food is good although the spices could have had more flavor in it. They keep the buffet stocked up. I like the yellow lentil soup. The service was good and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is a VAST distance from my house. Fortunately, I was in the area on business, met the wife and went here for lunch based on the positive Yelp reviews and the fact that she'd been here before and really liked it. GOD I'm glad I did. The first thing that hit me was the smell as we walked in - amazing. I've been to a lot of Indian buffets; this one SMELLED the best. So far, so good. Found our table but as usual with any given buffet, arse didn't hit the chair before I was schlopping food onto my plate. Dhal, channa, chicken curry, aloo gobhi, chicken tikka masala (out when I was at the buffet, but they filled it up pretty quick after), meat and pea samosas, potato pakoras, and a giant laundry-basket-sized rice cooker to scoop from. Flung a few ribbons of raita Jackson Pollock-like (or Ron Jeremy-like, depending on your aesthetic sensibilities) across the heaped plate and back to the table to dine. Out came some garlic naan (better than regular naan!) which was thin and fresh. Making good on the promise of the initial smell, the food was VERY flavorful. Best buffet I've been to. The chicken curry was actually SPICY, not dumbed down. Why the hell does this place have to be ~40 miles from my house? One thing's for sure, I'll be back. Maybe not for a while, but still - Indian Paradise rocketed to #1 on my Indian restaurant list after the first mouthful and I'm pretty sure the same will be the case for any Indian food aficionado that tries it. Word of warning - it may be too much of a punch in the mouth for newcomers to the cuisine - if that's you, I suggest getting your feet wet at Bombay Spice (Tatum and Shea) first before trying this joint. Came out with my gut looking like an alien was going to bust out of it and my tastebuds feeling as though they'd gone around the LHC a few billion times. Hands down five out of five."}
{"text":"I have never had Indian food so I can't say it is as good as it gets.  I did get the pleasure of eating lunch and sampling the buffet.  I tried many different items and they all were so good.  I love how the sauces (gravies)? are so complex and there are so many different flavors going on at once.  The iced tea was really good too.  I will love coming to visit this place again.  So yum!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service, quite and clean, love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, service, and atmosphere.  I've been here twice for dinner and once for the lunch buffet, and everything has been pretty consistent.  It's never crowded but there are usually at least a few other occupied tables so it's not dead either.    The other night for dinner I had a delicious mango corn soup that the waiter recommended.  The naan here is also very good - light, not too greasy, and never burned (at some places there are blackened parts, which means you're eating carcinogens).  I would say err on the spicier side when ordering, b/c the medium really didn't have any spiciness at all.    I was impressed with the lunch buffet.  Everything was hot and didn't seem like it had been sitting there forever.  There were various fresh vegetables, pickles, and sauces to start with.  For entrees they had three chicken dishes, two paneer dishes, daal, and something else with only vegetables.  Plus watermelon and rice pudding.  Quite a lot to choose from - or just pile a little bit of everything onto your plate like I did.    The waitress refilled our water glasses as needed and brought us more fresh naan.  I noticed the buffet was 9.99 not 8.99 as others have written, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"I love it! Try the tikka masala, aloo ghobi  and naan. We tried a chicken appetizer and have also  tried the samosas and they are divine! Nice wine selection."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've eaten here countless times and can honestly say that I've never had a bad experience! The people are extremely friendly and attentive.   The lunch buffet is where it's at! The food always tastes fresh and never seems dried out from heat lamp exposure! The chicken tandoori and chicken curry are to die for!!   I really can't say enough nice things about this place. If you like Indian food or want to try it, eat here. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love, LOVE this joint. Been here a couple times and we will be back. My children LOVE the food and so do I."}
{"text":"Outstanding Indian Food!  The Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chicken Vidaloo were both standouts.  I love their tandoori chicken and their biryani rice as well as their other dishes! If you want amazing Indian Food, here you go!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet. Easy and casual restaurant to try indian food. I'm not a big fan of indian food and always feel its a bit heavy to get a full sit down meal. For those who want to try a bit of different things - this place is a great spot! Food is surprisingly good and tasty with a wide selection for u to enjoy. Comfortable seating area with polite staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am crazy fussy about food and most especially Indian food. I LOVE it and need for the food to be amazing...and Indian Paradise is just that.  Amazing!  The Sag Paneer, Chicken tikki masala, garlic naan are all wonderful!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat. If you're looking for something new to try or you're an Indian food fanatic, this is the place for you.   The \"mom and pop\" atmosphere is relaxing and wonderful.   Come on the days the have the buffet to get an amazing bargain! Tuesday-Friday 11-2:30 ($9.95), and Sat/Sunday 12-3 ($11.95).   Fill your belly with delicious spice and flavor :)"}
{"text":"We have eaten dinner here many times, and I have never been disappointed.  True, I have had tastier saag dishes elsewhere, but the food and service here are consistently good.  I also enjoy the lunch buffet here, which is consistently better than other Indian food buffets in this area."}
{"text":"never going back. The food was really blend, went with a colleague for lunch buffet, every Indian place I have ever been to at least had good chicken tikka masala but it was just too bad here, paneer was equally tasteless. The place was surprisingly full, probably due to lots of IT companies near by."}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday night. It was pretty quiet. This made for a relaxing dinner where we could easily converse. We started out with Tandoori Chicken Wings-great presentation served on a sizzling skillet and very tasty. For entr√©es, I had Lamb Vindaloo and my partner had Goat Curry. Both entr√©es were very tasty and filling. We both ordered spicy. They offer you choice of mild, medium or spicy. This is great if you can't handle spicy food. We also got a side of naan - fluffy, soft and delicious - especially dipped in my Vindaloo gravy! Service was great and attentive. We will have to check out the weekend $12 lunch buffet on our next visit."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian Restaurants in the Valley. Jonathan is right, really good category! We have had dinner there several times. Lamb saag, chicken vindaloo and chicken tika masala are out favorites. We like it #8 and HOT! Garlic nann actually has garlic on it, unlike so many other Indian restaurants. Great service, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I had always had a good meal here on a weekend. We tried our luck on a Wednesday and it was a bad decision. We ordered the Chicken Tandoori Tikka sizzler and it was okay and not completely cooked. We then ordered our usual Chicken Makkhani and it was very bad in taste. We then complained to the staff that it was bad and not the usual one and the usual taste we have. They asked if we want something else. They did not even said for a replacement. My parents had come over and they had a very bad experience with the food taste. It is really ridiculous they charged me the entire bill and did even ask or go deep into the matter. I was a regular customer but now they have lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"Excellent! We tried it based on the nearby Yelp search and such a treat! This is our new favorite Indian spot.   Great service, 3 different waiters taking care of the dining room. Very prompt to bring crispy naan and sauces when we arrived.   We started with the crispy potato cakes - pakoras - and raita, delicious. Then things got even better... Chicken tikka masala and vegetable vindaloo with garlic naan.   Everything was amazing. We had 4 different sauces to dip in and the flavors were great. We like super spicy so we requested their hot sauce and it did not disappoint.   If you like great Indian, look no further!"}
{"text":"Anytime my girlfriend and I are craving Indian food, we will go here. So good! The people are friendly and it's not that expensive. My favorite thing is probably the vegetable pakoras! :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim while browsing the local sports car dealership. Thought about buying a Ferrari but got hungry so I came to this restaurant. Just so happened to come during this special buffet that yelpers are talking about. Was pleasantly surprised with how good the food was. I took a decent amount of everything and thoroughly enjoyed it. Indian food at other places can be overly spicy or overly dull. The food had great taste and perfect spice mix and the food had a nice quality taste to it. Definitely recommend it to others who are in the area purchasing Ferraris. Or just if you're hungry."}
{"text":"Solid Indian buffet that reminds me of all of the Indian buffets that I've tried.  A tad overpriced but the tasty samosas justify a semi-regular visit."}
{"text":"I had returned from weeks in India and started craving some delicious Indian food.  I did a yelp check and found this place online with a ton of positive reviews.  Although I live nowhere near it, I decided to pick up my friend and head out there.  First off, it's in a really weird location and I almost didn't spot it.  Plenty of parking if you go at night because everything is closed around it, and I almost assumed this place was closed as well until my friend told me we should try to get in anyway.  We walk in and we're instantly greeted by someone friendly and she seats us. They give us our menus and I already knew what I wanted. Muttar Mushroom, which I can't remember what they called it here.  One great thing is they offer it in many different strengths of spicy.  I went with medium but quickly regretted not getting it spicy like they do in India.  It was a little bland and even my friend tasted it and thought it was bland.  He got something different with chicken and his was slightly better on the spice and he ordered medium as well.  One thing we both felt was the food was too westernized.  I normally wouldn't have noticed this had I not backpacked around India for weeks and eaten much of the local food there.  But the prices were reasonable, everything was clean, and everyone was friendly enough to let us stay and enjoy our meal even though it was past closing time.  I would return here and give them a second chance but I think I'll try a different dish with much more spice and kick to it."}
{"text":"I really must do my Yelp reviews sooner.  I had a terrific lunch with Audrey W at Indian Paradise several months ago.  We opted for the buffet.  Although I cannot remember exactly what was offered, I do remember there was plenty to choose from and everything was hot and delicious.  Fresh naan was brought to our table as well.  I also remember the staff was a little too nice.  We didn't realize they close between lunch and dinner and continued to chat away after their closing time.  No one said a word and no looks were thrown our way.  In fact, we didn't realize they were closed until we went to leave and noticed the door was locked..and the restaurant was empty.  It was good conversation:)"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic choice! My friends and I (who have traveled to India) went out for dinner here and couldn't have been happier. The service was great and the food was fantastic. They seem to always have a Yelp deal going on as well."}
{"text":"Yummy, nice staff, kids platter. All good. My only complaint is that it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"I would give them 3.5  We got there for early dinner thinking they had buffet, but they did not. Hubby had been fasting so we didn't want to look for other options and wait longer. We stayed and ordered from the menu. Chicken Tikka Masala (it comes with rice, not all white but I do not know what it has, I checked online and it could be cumin seeds) and we also ordered naan.  Kudos to our server (a young lady) that volunteered some information about Chicken Tikka being served with no sauce (I got confused and ordered Chicken Tikka, instead of Chicken Tikka Masala), so thanks to her timely intervention I got what I meant to order, and not what I had mistakenly ordered, if that makes any sense : P  *We forgot to ask for our food to be hot/spicy : (  We had only water to drink, and overall everything was good. I was a little disappointed with the sauce on the chicken, but that could be because this place is from a different area in India or something...  Garlic naan was really good. Also, the place itself is very nice, they have booths and it is nicely decorated. The place is more inviting than the IP 2  I just would like to mention that I am sensitive to scents and our server was wearing a perfume a little too strong if you ask me.  I would like to go back to try the buffet."}
{"text":"Today I went back there for the champagne brunch on Sunday - this time the service was great! All three staff people were attentive, and warm and friendly.  The food is consistent in being very good. Every time I've been there I have enjoyed it quite a lot.  Today the service matched my delight with the food. The over-all dining experience was excellent."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Lamb tandoori, vegetable korma, garlic naan were so well cooked and seasoned. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food! Their garlic naan is to die for! We had the Buttered Chicken and Chicken tika masala. Awesome service, will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for Indian food. We like that it is a casual environment. We only come here for dinner, which is always pretty calm and not to crowded. I wish I worked close by so that I could try the lunch buffet as it sounds like a great deal. Depending on our appetite we might get a starter, vegetable samosas, or we might just order our meals with sides of garlic naan. If you enjoy naan I recommend getting the garlic for a little bit more flavor. I usually get chicken vindaloo because I love to eat spicy food, but I have had many of the other chicken dishes as well and have never left feeling disappointed. You get a large portion that can be split or is great for leftovers the next day. They also give you a generous amount of rice. My husband never leaves there without getting rice pudding for dessert, which he says is one of the best he has had. Minus one star because I was disappointed that the restrooms were not equipped with a changing table for my baby. No one should have to lay their baby on a bathroom floor, luckily I happened to have a changing pad with me."}
{"text":"Indian Paradise lives up to its name.  Buttery-fresh naan, tasty samosas, creamy palak paneer, savory chicken tandoori, Indian salads, and so many other options make this a place to be reckoned with...  Seriously, they have teleported some of the best Indian dishes into Phoenix and are ready to square off with the best in the area!  Not to mention, the service is superb and the building has a classy/ eclectic flavor to it that is hard to find fault with.   A bit more coconut milk may help to sweeten the dishes, but other than that, this is one of the best Indian buffets that you'll find in PHX!"}
{"text":"be ready to wait more than 30 min for each order.  ordered appetizer and cane 30 min later. ordered naan and got curry .. waiting for last 37 minutes and still no food. they refilled our water glass 3 times in between. very poor service."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Coconut Curry. It was delicious. I got the medium heat one and I had some sweat on my forehead. My family liked it too. I'm happy to find an Indian food restaurant that I like, very close to my house."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit and it was prompted by all of the positive reviews.  Sunday evening it was not crowded at all and the server told us that evenings are not nearly as busy as lunchtime.  We ordered buttered naan bread, samosas, chicken vindaloo with basmati rice and lamb biryani.  Everything was excellent!  Just the right amount of spice, generous servings and unlimited refills of our diet cokes.  The service was prompt and pleasant and the chef even came out to say hello and ask if everything was to our liking.  No issues at all.  Will definitely go back.  Didn't give a 5 star simply because the restaurant itself lacks a bit of ambiance, but other than that 5 stars for the food and service!"}
{"text":"I got take out here so I really cannot speak to the service.  I did like being able to order and pay through Yelp. The service was prompt and they were nice people.   The shrimp vindaloo I had was good and was plenty for two people.  There was plenty of shrimp and nice chunks of potato.  The naan was a bit of a disappointment. It tasted old and kind of off."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner yesterday after I had been craving Indian food for a while. Was pretty good! First we had chutneys with some type of cracker bread and that was good, we liked the green one the best. For my meal I got garlic naan and dark lentils, I can't remember what exactly it was called. This also came with rice. The naan wasn't the best naan I've had but it was pretty yummy. Lentils and rice were really delicious and flavorful, I'd order it again, but there are a bunch of other things on the menu I'd like to try again! I also tried a few sips of mango lassi, I don't think I like lassi but I am glad I gave it a try haha.  The service was not too bad. Slow, but that's just because there was a little party going on there! Otherwise good. I'd come back but probably just for take out."}
{"text":"Sadly, this location is now closed. If you would like to be contacted when they open a new location, send an email to indianparadiseaz@gmail.com."}
{"text":"Continues to be great, new experimental dishes on the buffet today.  A fish medley and a spicy chicken, both very good."}
{"text":"we had our valentines dinner here at Indian paradise, were so excited that there's Indian restaurant here in Scottsdale since we just recently moved from San Francisco. I only gave 2 stars because the food are way to expensive for what you get and thee food isn't that great either. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant at dinner time."}
{"text":"I had an enjoyable lunch here with Rand H. and Mike C. the other day.  Indian Paradise has a very nice lunch buffet with a variety of authentic Indian cuisine items   to choose from.     Restaurant~ very clean and inviting.  It's not a large restaurant but it has plenty of room for multiple groups. The service is OK, not bad but not great either.     Food~ we started with some soup and salad.  They had one soup, tomato soup on the day we went.  It was OK and so was the salad. They bring fresh pita bread to your table.  Some with garlic and herbs, which was very nice.  They had several dishes to choose, some with curry and without.  The Chicken curry was very good and so was their Paneer's.  I was looking forward to the Tandoori Chicken and their Chicken Tikka Marsala, but the chicken had a sparse odor of benzene so it was not tasty. They also had roasted jalapeno's with black salt, which I think is an acquired taste ~ not for me.    All in all, some of their food tasted very good and some not so good. Most everything is a bit mushy so you will need to start at the rice cooker or get a bunch of bowls.  This is a very good place to try some Indian cuisine if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Never had Indian food before, my husband took me to this restaurant.The waitress came and I saw her hitting something with the menu, I ignored it but then I saw what she was trying to hide it was a cockroach on the wall by my table.I walked out never taste their food if they had cockroaches in their dining area imagen the kitchen"}
{"text":"Indian food in America is like Chinese food in America: it is either really good, or really bad. Indian Paradise, in my experience there several times (dinners), falls into the really good category. Lots of great flavor from healthy entrees, breads, salads, and sauces.  I haven't tried the lunch buffet yet, but I would definitely recommend this place for a really good Indian dinner."}
{"text":"Food was decent but nothing to write home about. This used to be the best Indian restaurant in the valley. Sadly, that's not the case anymore.  Got chicken vindaloo and Chana masala. Chicken vindaloo isn't supposed to be tomato-based, but here it was. Tasted like a slightly altered version of chicken tikka masala. Chana masala was average as well."}
{"text":"Usually very good but ran out of a buffet staple, chicken tikka masala because \"we're closing in 5 minutes\" is disappointing  since I and several others were seated 20 minutes ago and first run then was empty as well.  Still my favorite Indian spot in Scottsdsle.  Added 9/4/2015: Today was a good day! Not hit or miss but last visit was a miss partly Bc I came at the very end of lunch buffet on a slow Saturday afternoon and they ran out of chx tiki masala.  Today was a glorious day.  Food delish as I am accustomed and great service and plentiful at the buffet."}
{"text":"Delicious! Our party of four wished we could start over again because everything was so wonderful. We are now using the Naan bread to eat the last of the tikka masala sauce. Give this place a try. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Buffet is great, Good Selection of food even for me the picky Vegetarian. Naan tastes great, choice of plain or Garlic Naan. Food generally tastes good. Rating on Buffet alone, I would have given 4 stars.  However I might not return there for Dinner or Take-out.  Dinner Entries are priced well above $10,  and generally use frozen vegetables (Crinkle cut carrots anyone, god I hate those)   The last time I ordered take out, the quantity of my dishes was about half of what I got the previous time. (Fine, Can I pay you a little less than the bill?) and the food tasted sub-par and my naan was burnt. For this they get only 1 star.  Good place for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"First time we had Indian food & take out. The veggie samosa were fair. The tandoori wings were fair. The tiki masala was very good along with the garlic naan. The shrimp masala only had a few shrimp. The lamb curry was very spicy. My husband did not enjoy it."}
{"text":"So glad I stumbled up this place, it's been years since I've had Indian cuisine. And the chicken tikka masala was just as good as I remember from a place on the east coast I use to get it. Just wish they had a peshwari naan, however the garlic one was delicious. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time on Wednesday, with two other friends for the lunch buffet, around 2.15. Not knowing/understanding that this place closes from 2.30 to 5 pm. The lady told us that they're NOT refilling anymore so we could see if whatever was left over was OK to pay full price for. With the amount of food that there was left that would've been a no-brainer. So I asked her if she meant no more 'lunch buffet price' or NO more period. No apologies or feeling bad for rejecting unknowing customers. Food MIGHT be good, but these people sure don't know how to deal with customers professionally. ESPECIALLY when it comes to rejecting customers."}
{"text":"It's good if you want a fast food Indian, the spices are watered down, the food is not rich in flavor, I've had much better, sorry guys...."}
{"text":"This was my first Indian restaurant experience Ever! I am totally open to try everything and anything. So...I Did. I was debating on the 3-4 stars because mostly of the naan bread! Holy jeebus....that Naan bread and rice pudding and the little sugary dough balls are my favorites go figure.  I wanted to dip that delicious bread into just the masala sauces.  I am half Filipino so me and rice go together like a fish with water.  Only thing I disliked immensely is the different grain of rice.  If i had my own jasmine rice with me i might have enjoyed everything even more.  I love curry and their curry was not bad I loved the kick to it but I am too spoiled from panang curry. When I do not eat amazing curry I almost need my favorite curry to make up for the not so great curry.  The man I worked for said he liked the food more at tandoori times but liked the price more at Indian paradise. Especially since it was a buffet. Will I crave Indian on a regular basis No, Will I still go with other people that want it Definitely but will stop at a thai spot for some jasmine rice to bring with me ;)"}
{"text":"Change it up and get diverse with Indian Paradise  ... Good selections, good taste and ready to serve you  attitude"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  The owner chef has a gift. I am so spoiled.  We eat mostly lamb and chicken curries, spicy, they have never sent out a dish that wasn't pipping hot and perfectly spiced. The owners are very nice people as is their staff.  The only possible negative thing to say is the lunch buffet  can get picked over and be very slow to replenish.  I imagine if I got there early it would be better, so....if you like buffets get there super early.  Like 11:00."}
{"text":"I am glad we found this spot!  It was recommended from an Indian friend of ours and he is just about the most pickiest man alive. So we called them up and placed a big ass feast phone order. Service was great and helpful even though I cannot pronounce many of the menu items correctly.  Lots of vegi options and everything was really flavorful. The pricing is totally reasonable too. I have been back twice in 3 weeks.  I would recommend this place for great take out, a date night, lunch and more."}
{"text":"Solid Indian food with the tikki and vindalos outstanding  Appetizers were well done  Mango lassi was great"}
{"text":"The Naan Varieties are are really delicious. We mostly go for lunch buffets as they have more varieties served and is less expensive. The chicken curry is really good (not the spice that I expected thou), but my favorite will always be Lamb curry at Indian Paradise. Tandoori Chicken very well marinated is adequately juicy."}
{"text":"Indian Paradise... where have you been my entire Valley life?  I've been in search of an Indian place like this since I moved here, and even if it is (what seems like) a million miles away from me, I'm happy to have found something I can fully rely on.  Hands down, the best Indian that I've had in the Valley.  Chicken tikka masala is my stand-by and they cook it well.  I've also experienced the Sunday buffet which I highly recommend.    The service is to the point, as I would expect at most Desi restaurants.  I'm hesitant to drive this far, but I've still done it about five times since I first checked it out, so clearly it has me jonesing a little."}
{"text":"Went for my first time to the lunch buffer.  It was fabulous.  Great food. Worth the $11."}
{"text":"I had a very different experience here, but I did not order from the buffet I ordered to go I had takiki Marsala, Channa Marsala and some lovely veg samosas. This was the first time I went to this place the food was good...some of the best that I have tasted. I will definitely go to this place again the staff was friendly and I guess I am going to have to try the buffet."}
{"text":"Came here in a group of 6 ladies after Bollywood dance class, it was perfect.  We had the buffet lunch, the price is right, the food was delicious and fresh ( the best Indian food in Scottsdale) so far. The staffs were very friendly and the restaurant was nice and clean, what a perfect day for Indian food.  Will definitely recommend to friends and would love to comeback for more. Thank you!"}
{"text":"One of the better Indian restaurants in Scottsdale. I went for the lunch buffet, and at $9, it's well worth the money. The naan (Indian bread) was the softest I have ever eaten at an Indian restaurant in the US. I did have complaints with a couple of dishes though. The potato bhajji (fried potato fritters) were very hard and my girl friend almost cracked a tooth trying to eat it! The chicken makhani had pieces that were obviously shredded ones from the tandoori chicken, But I guess not every dish in a buffet would be exceptional. Overall it was a lovely lunch and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I don't know if the cook was having a bad day or if this is their standard. I ordered very simple comfort food and nothing fancy. They could even get the 'daal' right. Will never go again to this place."}
{"text":"I really like this place and it has become our go to carry out Indian restaurant. I've heard their lunch buffet is very good but have yet to make it in.  My wife and I always split the chicken Tikka masala and butter naan, it is plenty of food for two and the meal comes with rice.  I normally can eat large quantities but splitting it is the perfect amount.  The service is always very good.  Over all, I'm thankful we found Indian paradise."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service and the food is as authentic Indian as it gets. I have eaten at many Indian restaurants but nothing come close to this one. Simply delicious  food, unpretentious menu and relaxed atmosphere. Give it try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"hmm Indian food sounds good tonight, well I am in luck, Indian Paradise is but a mere hop skip & a jump jump, so off we go. Ordered vegetable samoosa's, Rogan Josh and Shahi Kofta Curry.  Both were lamb dishes and both were very good.  I will certainly venture back and look forward to going for lunch!  Our service was just outstanding, absolutely superior, tops!!!  You just can't beat a staff who perform their duties whilst expressing such happiness!  Right!?!  And above all else, they play cricket on their TV!  When I found this out, it was a done deal for me, YAY!!!  AND, the food is good, life is pleasant :-)"}
{"text":"Perhaps our favorite Indian restaurant in town. The staff is always friendly and helpful, but reserved. We've only been to the lunch buffet, at least a dozen times, and we like it. Great options for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. Hot from the oven naan is delivered promptly to the table as you visit the buffet. The food is wonderfully spiced but not too much for our American taste buds. I like the fact that the restaurant is usually about half filled with Indian people, always a great sign that the food must be good and authentic. Highly recommend Indian Paradise."}
{"text":"Some of my brown brothers (it's OK, close friends can actually talk about each others' races in good fun...but that's another topic) recommended this place to me. The food was pretty good for dinner but pretty overpriced as well.  The little side condiments on the table were great though.  There is a waiter(owner?) there who looks like me (Asian) but speaks like an Indian. Awesome! God bless America!!"}
{"text":"We just moved to Phoenix from Colorado. In Boulder there are tons of Indian food and Nepali places to choose from and my family is also Nepali, so when it comes to that style of food, I know what I am looking for.  So when my husband and I were in the mood for some home-cooked food (we dont have a kitchen yet) we yelped up the best restaurant and drove about 45 minutes to get there. When we got to Indian Paradise it was just after 5 so we were the first ones in there. We ordered daal, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, garlic naan and vegetable samosas.  We are always wary of trying new places for Indian cuisine because we are soo often disappointed, but this restaurant was a very pleasant surprise. It was really very delicious. Some of the best chicken tikka I have ever had. I ordered mine at medium spice but I probably could have had it more spicy. I also tried the chicken curry that the hubby ordered and it was very delicious!! We were very very pleased with the food over-all and will most definitely go back even though it was more expensive.  The staff was also very nice. We told (I'm assuming) the owner that we were new and we found this place on yelp and he was very happy about that. We asked of some places to go with some hindu culture and he graciously gave us some ideas. He also gave us his card and told us to call if we needed help finding anything culture based.   The only down side was that I DID get some dirty looks from a woman who pulled up in a yellow corvette. I'm assuming she just is not very well cultured. We eat Indian food with our hands because that is how it is meant to be eaten. I swear it tastes better that way! Ask anyone from India or Nepal and I guarantee you they do eat with their hands and will show you the technique. So when we had been craving some home cooked food I decided I was going to eat it how it tasted best. The dirty looks were well worth it though because the food was SOOOOOO good. Completely satisfying. I am very very glad that we made the drive up there (we live all the way at baseline and central). The left-overs the next day were awesome! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable priced. They are a great staple for the traditional Indian dishes. Good, reliably consistent, unless you order on a mid week early dinner. Must be a different chef. ;)  I recommend, I go on a regular basis and I am from London and know a lot about Indian food, if I do say so myself. lol ;)"}
{"text":"I love their lunch buffet. Reminds me of the indian buffets I would go to in Chicago. Their chicken tikka is great, as is their saag paneer. I love that they have mango lassis as part of the buffet. They have some yummy vegetarian dishes too!"}
{"text":"Indian food is often minimized by attempts to make it less exact and somehow more palatable by other cultures.  This is at the cost often of not allowing the original beauty of the cuisine to be savoured by all. In fact, my visit to the Indian Paradise was not without some sarcasm and pessimism on my part given that so many places in the area get it wrong when it comes to this genre.   Boy, was I wrong!  Don't let the fascade of the place fool you.  When you enter, it takes a few seconds to smell the fact that you are going to have the genuine article here.  If you go at lunch time, you can experience the buffet.  I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was perfectly poised for a sunset dining experience. ALL the food...from the nan to the lamb curry, to the tea, to the samosas to the califlower....EVERYTHING was really good.  But I have to also add that there was a certain family-like atmosphere created by the staff and the service was unassuming yet intuitive.  I found that I did not want to leave.  I just wanted to stay here and talk and snack a little.  That's kind of hard to achieve in a strip mall restaurant yet, this did not feel like that. You should go for yourself and see if I was just way too nostalgic for good Indian or whether its really worth 4 stars."}
{"text":"So delicious! The waiter was so friendly and the service was quick even though it was a little crowded."}
{"text":"The interior is clean and decorated well. Went here for the lunch buffett; for $11.95, you get a good selection of food: chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, samosas, chicken tandoori, aloo gobhi, and some others I missed. All of them tasted good for a buffett, and they made a conscious effort to refill the food quickly. I also got garlic naan with my order and I highly recommend it: it was very crispy and didn't have too much garlic on it. For desert I had the gulab jamun with rice pudding, which was also very good. My only complaint was the rice: it was kinda hard and thin. I'm not sure if they intend to cook it this way, but I prefer my rice kinda sticky.   Service was pretty good as well. They took away the buffett plates in a timely manner and refills were prompt. I got tired of going to the chain restaurants, so if you're in Scottsdale I would recommend this place for a nice change of pace."}
{"text":"Solid Northern Indian food, this is one of the only Indian restaurants in our area, so we were happy to stumble upon some good Indian food. We had the Chicken Tikka Masala, Rogan Josh, Naan and Veggie Samosas, all were delish! This place is also good for carry out, they have a lunch buffet we have not tried, full bar and also work with a few delivery services such as Door Dash and Eat24. If you're in the area and craving Indian it's worth a stop!"}
{"text":"I only stopped in for takeout. Everyone I spoke to was very nice, they were speedy, and the food was delicious when I finally got home. I ordered soup and lamb dish and both were fantastic. Together it came out to about $21. I've heard they have a great lunch buffet-- I'll be sure to try that next."}
{"text":"The food is outrageously delicious! I will always go back when I'm craving Indian food. Which now is a lot more often because it's so good."}
{"text":"Had a urge for something spicy today and found Indian Paradise.  We found a groupon, but it was only good for dinner 5pm-10pm, but we decided to try the buffet as it looked great, and the other yelp reviews were positive.  Well we were glad we went in.  The servers were wonderful and made sure our glasses were full with water and drinks the entire time.  I only usually get water, but they were nice enough to tell us drinks were included, so I had a sprit which was nicely carbonated, which is important!  There is nothing worse than not being able to feel the carbonation in the stomach moving things around. :-)  The servers also made this a wonderful experience in the fact that they also had my plate remove every single time I went back for more food, which was a lot!  All the food was hot and fresh.  I would suggest going around 11:30am when there were not that many people, because by 12:30pm, it was packed!  The food is nicely labeled and they had a variety of chicken, lamb, goat, and lots of vegetable choices.  I am a stickler on the rice and they had it cooked just right.  I think the part I like best is that I did not have to continue to ask for things like naam bread, they just knew to bring it to me.  The impression I got was that they are about the customer experience and not just trying saving a time.  I also asked for plain naam bread and they brought it to me without charge.  The food was not that spicy, I would assume because a buffet, but I am sure they would bring you extra spices if asked.  I was happy the way it was.  We have $25 and will definitely be back!  :)"}
{"text":"We went there for Father's day dinner. The Chicken tikka masala was good but the Chef's tandoori special for $21.95 was terrible! It was like a very horrible fajita with all their lunch meat left overs. The meat was tough and bad tasting not tandoori style at all.The sikh kabab was more like sausage texture. We thought to get the best for my poor husband's Father's day, but he ended up with the most expensive food on the menu that was also the worst on the menu.  The rice also was all broken up and old. Since we were starving and was Father's day, we did not complain. I will make sure NEVER again go for dinner there. Dinner is too expensive and not  good.The Buffet should be OK.  I will give it one more try but on their buffet. It seems they take Buffet left overs and serve it a la cart at dinner time and charge three times more."}
{"text":"Had the lunch buffet & the food was decent  for $10.95. They have a variety of veg & non-veg dishes along with the  Bread (Naan) & Basmati Rice. 2 soups - I tried the tomato soup & it was bad, the paneer dishes(tikka masala & palak) were good, the chicken curry was watery & of mediocre taste,the tandoori chicken was good however,the dal makhani & basmati rice were too bland & the desserts(gulab jamun & rice pudding) were just okay.  Final Verdict: The quality of the lunch buffet ain't that great. I know a lot of other indian restaurants that offer better food than this one. They sure lack the \"quality\" on my scale. You can give this one a try though.  PS: I to-go'd Kadai Paneer once (√Ä la carte) & I loved it, very delicious! Tried the buffet for the same reason, but was disappointed!"}
{"text":"7/25/12  Heard great things about Indian Paradise from good Yelp friends, and I thought it was about time I scratched this itch I had for Indian cuisine for many weeks.  I've passed IP many times before, noting it was on Hayden Rd, but never really memorized its location.  Disregard the directions from Navigation android app and follow Yelp directions, instead.    $10.95 gets you all-you-can-eat lunch buffet with fresh garlic naan and a glass of water.  All other beverages will cost extra.  I ordered a mango lassi for $4.  Buffet selections weren't many, but I managed to gather a varied plate http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg?select=d7H3JJ4h89IFRIFY0IA-7w#d7H3JJ4h89IFRIFY0IA-7w that consisted of (clockwise starting with) Tandoori chicken, Palak paneer, Chicken tikka masala, Dal tadka (yellow lentils), Dal makhni (red lentils), Chicken curry,  Paneer tikka masala (curd cheese in masala sauce), some shredded lettuce for texture (not pictured), mango and tamarind chutneys, and finally Gulab jamun for dessert.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg?select=SzJNBzvd9lXjaDhg9DMh7g#SzJNBzvd9lXjaDhg9DMh7g  The mango lassi was gorgeous, and better yet, it tasted fantastic!  Before I had a taste of it, a man who was passing by my table on his way out of the door stopped to ask what it was.  I guess he liked the look of it, as well.  I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loves mango lassis-- great mango flavor, a touch of sweetness, and a definite yogurt tang.  The naan took a long time to arrive, even after I sat down, asked for a lassi, first had a look at the buffet choices, and then proceeded to gather my plate and utensils before lining up to get food.  I had to wait another five minutes, maybe more, before it arrived on my table, which then allowed me to take a good photo to upload and THEN start eating.  The naan was warm, some parts were crispy, some parts were charred, and not very flavorful.  I couldn't detect a garlic flavor at all.  The dals were OK, the red saltier than the yellow, so I preferred the yellow.  I found the palak paneer to be tastier than the paneer tikka masala, which was salty, yet I found the paneer tikka masala's curd cheese cubes to be more tender, therefore more preferable; The cheese cubes in the palak paneer were rubbery.  The chicken curry was very appetizing!  Loved sopping up the sauce with the naan.  Perhaps the blandness of the naan was intentional, to make it a great companion to the sauces...  The tandoori chicken was very, very good, and perhaps the best I've tried anywhere.  Great smoke flavor, tender and moist-- I wouldn't mind ordering this for an entree.  I was already finished with lunch and wanted dessert (gulab jamun, rice pudding, or watermelon slices) when I spotted the chutneys, but I had some naan left, so I thought to try them out.  The mango chutney looked wonderful, and made me wish I had pancakes or crispy waffles to eat it with.  Before trying it with naan, I spooned a little bit into my mouth and found it to be quite salty, so it wouldn't do well for a sweet snack, unless you like sweet and salty (and I do on occasion, but not in mango chutneys).  The tamarind chutney, more syrup than chunky chutney really, was definitely sweeter.  The gulab jamun rounds were tougher than others I've tried; I kept wishing the centers were creamier/silkier.  I liked the sweet milk flavor, although the syrup wasn't scented with rosewater or saffron.  I'd say pass on these last three and save your calories for a lassi!"}
{"text":"First time at this place and it was sooooooo good. The flavor of the naan was just right...hot and soft. I am definitely going again!!!"}
{"text":"Solid choice for a good weekend buffet. The price on the weekends is $11.95, and it includes soda, or one glass of champagne. Weekday prices do not include drinks but are cheaper.  The spread here had a nice variety of meaty and vegetarian dishes. Such entrees included mutter paneer, chicken curry, goat curry, chicken makhani, mushroom curry, an unusual butternut squash curry (Quite tasty! I love butternut squash), aloo palak, dal makhani, tandoori chicken, and chana masala. Fried items included potato pakora and vegetable samosa. There was a diverse salad bar, 2 different types of chaat, and various condiments like mint chutney. Dessert consisted of mango pudding, kheer (rice pudding), and gulab jamun. The gulab jamun was decent, but more hard and dense tasting than others I've had.   In addition to the soda or champagne, there is a self serve mango lassi station which was quite nice. There is also a crock of tomato soup and a cooker filled with rice. Another plus about this restaurant is that they will make fresh, hot off the oven naan for you in a basket. Tasty!  Service was great and drinks + plates were refilled and taken away as needed.  Overall, a good experience, and the food itself was decent. Go for the great deal for what you get, and the variety of dishes."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  We went for dinner over the weekend, and the food was horrible.  Sheerly, purely horrible.  We ordered the mixed appetizer platter to start.  The food was so overly salty, it was unpalatable.  We also ordered tandoori chicken wings, which, in the rest of the Indian restaurant world, would be dry-style red chicken wings on a plate.  Here they brought it out on a sizzling platter with a ridiculously large amount of peppers and onions.  It was like a fajita plate.  The wings weren't tandoori style, either.   They were grilled, and since they were covered in peppers and onions, were soggy.  Bleh.  Moving onto entr√©e...DH ordered the tandoori lamb. Same sitch as the wings - came out as tiny chunks of lamb mixed with peppers and onions on a sizzling (fajita) platter.  I ordered a curry dish which was good.  No complaints there, and they got the spice done right.  We also ordered naan, which was BURNT.  In my long life, I've never once had burnt naan.  Normally it's fluffy and light.  Theirs was burnt and flat.  It wasn't very fresh-tasting either, so I suspect it was leftover from the lunch buffet, and reheated, hence the dry texture and the char.  Not sure if it was a REALLY REALLY off night, but the entire meal was pretty bad.  We took home nearly all of it, and tossed it as soon as we could.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not located in the best area and a little hard to see from the main street but definitely worth looking for and trying it. I had the tandori chicken and the vegetable pakoras. The chicken was juicy and was full of flavor and the pakoras were made just right. The service was also very good. Overall an enjoyable experience. Will return again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the valley. I've gone to quite a few places and none of them are as good as this. The place is never too busy so it is a quiet experience, but the staff are always wonderful, and recognize you when you come back. I recommend the chicken curry, vegetable pakoras, and aloo matar. 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and has finally reopened as Nirvana Indian Cuisine. You can reach them at 480-483-9284. They are located at 14891 N. Northsight Blvd. #119. We were shocked when they closed and tried finding a new place but none were as good as this place. Simply the best!! They are taking phone orders now and plan to open officially at the end of September."}
{"text":"Got malai kofta and shrimp masala. It was soo yummy. Can't wait to try some of the other dishes the next time"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. They have a lunch box special, but won't allow you to eat on the premises.   Each time I've gone in, they've never offered to seat me (I go alone).  I've had to ask about the lunch special all three times, and have not really been told much else other than \"ok\".  Left in the entryway, with no offer of a seat, or any indication of where to pay, or if I can sit down while I wait. They bring the food, but no one seems to know if I've paid or not - communication among staff isn't exactly stellar.  The lunch box I've had 3 times has been chicken tikka masala (despite what the menu says the lunch box of the day is).  The rice is really good. The chicken tikka masala is decent, but seemed to be more sauce than chicken.  The naan bread (garlic) is kickass.  Just okay, although I'll probably go back for the naan alone.  They do a lunch buffet, but I have never been offered a seat, so... haven't tried it."}
{"text":"This is our most favorite place for Indian lunch. Their buffet is always great and items are enriched with north Indian flavor. On weekend buffet drink is also included. They always have many items and all are refilled quickly. Quality of service is also great. This place missed one star because of its dinner, our experience was not so good with it."}
{"text":"I rate restaurants on a 10 scale and give this the equivalent of 6 maybe a 7. Service was excellent.  Entrees were very good but it takes a lot to get to an 8 on my scale.  Ambiance is better than Udupi which is near AZU and vegetarian only if you are into that."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants I've been to in Phoenix! We got samosas to start; for entrees we had chicken tikka tandoori, chicken korma, lamb kofta curry, and plain naan. Everything was pretty delicious! The chicken korma was better than I think I've ever had and I really enjoyed the chicken tikka tandoori! The naan was wonderful also! The samosa wasn't the best one I've had, but it was still good and big portions! We also had one of the specialty cocktails with mango lassi, yum! Lastly, the staff was friendly and quick! I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The service was really good and our food came out quickly, but overall the taste of the food was not all that impressive.   We started with the veggie samosas and the filling was tasty and filled the pastry well, but the actual pastry itself was hard instead of flaky and crunchy. It didn't seem as though it was freshly made.   The Aloo Gohbi was average tasting. My husband enjoyed his butter chicken but felt it was a bit dry. My brother had Mali Kofta and had felt it had good flavor and was nicely spiced. They both enjoyed their Gaelic naan but the aloo paratha bread was a tad burned.   The portions were very large leaving us all with leftovers and there was more than enough rice for the table.   The highlight of the meal was the Indian Iced Tea made with cardamom and cinnamon. I had two glasses and could have drank two more easy.   Overall the service was great, prices were reasonable, and the food was okay."}
{"text":"Don't believe a word I write about Indian Paradise because, after all, I am a devotee of Indian food.  Don't believe me when I tell you that the lunch buffet here consists of about a dozen main dishes and at least ten of them are superb.  Please don't believe me about just how delicious the tikka masalas are, or the saag paneer (creamy Indian cheese and spinach).  Please, please, don't believe any of it, because if you do, then you will start coming here and your friends will follow and soon I won't be able to get a table.  Seriously, the secret of Indian Paradise is that they cook everything very expertly.  The only downside -- it is a relatively small buffet -- is really a blessing in disguise, because if they had even one more option, I would have to try it and would then be unable to rise from my chair at the end of the meal.  Here is what you will get (in general, as the menu varies somewhat from day to day): chicken tandoori, chicken and/or goat curry (their goat is a rare misfire, often too bony), chicken or cheese tikki masala, at least one creamy spinach dish, a couple of other meat entrees, lentils, several vegetarian options, at least one of which will be pretty spicy, rice, naan and one other bread, a couple of appetisers (like samosas, for example), a half dozen sauces, and rice pudding and honeyed cheese balls for dessert.  To drink, included in the price, try the mango lassi.  Hints:  Don't eat breakfast.  Don't worry about cooking dinner."}
{"text":"If u r spice lover then stay away from this restaurant.  Food was pretty stale. As far as deserts are concerned, i tried \"Rasgulla\", not sure why they made it so hard... worst part was after i paid the bill and was coming out, i saw the server ( waiter ) picking up glasses with all the fingers inside it."}
{"text":"Oh, tasty! Very tender vindaloo, and the chicken tiki masala was fantastic. I can't call myself an expert in Indian cuisine, but my un-skilled palate was quit satisfied.   Staff was efficient and friendly. I think I'll make this a regular lunch stop!"}
{"text":"Swung by IP for lunch today and as always, it was a nice buffet lunch.  They had the 2008 Cricket World Championship on the TV and yep just like the last time I saw the 2008 Cricket World Championship there, the same team won.  Haha, jk, I don't know if it's the same game but more often than not, the TV is turned to a game of Cricket.  For those of you who haven't tried the buffet lunch, swing by and do yourself a favor.  The establishment is clean, the food is nice and hot, the service is great, and the curry chicken is delicious.  If you happen to show up and curry chicken is available - definitely try it.  The sauce looks a tad greasy but c'mon - you only live once right?   In all seriousness though - it's a nice place to load up on Indian food but the buffet has a limited variety day to day.  In fact, it's the SAME thing every day so if you're a creature of habit (like I am) then you'll be happy as a clam but if you're always looking for a variety of Indian dishes, ummm...  become a creature of habit?"}
{"text":"A very, very average restaurant.   Based on the reviews here for the lunch buffet, I gave dinner a try.   Of many Indian restaurants I've tried throughout the world, this was at the bottom 10%.   So don't expect much.   (And do not order the Pakoras.   The worst!)  But, this being Scottsdale, it seems that folks will settle for just about anything."}
{"text":"Very good find in Scottsdale! Went in for the lunch buffet which was a great deal at ~$10. Got some tikka masala, chicken curry and tandori chicken. They bring unlimited garlic naan bread to the table nonstop. The mango pudding was also a perfect finisher for the filling meal. Definitely going to come back again."}
{"text":"I got Dal Tadka, yellow lentil dish, with basmati rice but honestly there wasn't anything about it that was special.  The Tasty Bite, prepackaged dal, was better than what I got tonight.  Also, the basmati rice tasted dry and the grains were broken, unlike fresh rice, it tasted old- where it has been refrigerated and reheated.    Also, the gentleman who took my order and took our payment, didn't seem the friendliest.  Not sure, but he didn't smile at any time.  The lady who was the manager or owner was friendly and that's why I'm giving this place a 3.   Probably won't return here again for Indian food."}
{"text":"I've only had the buffets but I'm giving this place 5 stars because it's consistently AMAZING!!!  My boys 5 and 8 ask to eat here!  The week buffet doesn't have as large as an assortment as it does on the weekend but the price is less than the weekend.  With the food being made fresh and in-house--- the price is well worth it.  Great attentive staff as well as friendly.  We always feel welcomed and appreciated and WE ALWAYS LEAVE FULL & HAPPY!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Not good Indian food anymore!  A few years ago, the Indian food here was great.  Unfortunately, now it seems like Mexicans have taken over and are trying to ride on the coat tails of the previous highly rewarded Indian Paradise reputation (as noted on wall plaques).  The chicken tikka masala, lamb rogan josh, and garlic naan (what garlic?) was sub par to any we've had at Indian restaurants around the country, completely lacking in typical Indian flavor.  There wasn't an Indian person in sight.  We got the feeling that if the kitchen would've sent out carne asada, maybe we would've had a good meal because we do love Mexican food. Could be that the Indian chef was off for the night but at any rate we had an extremely disappointing experience compared to a few years ago."}
{"text":"**Update...we went back and the food was great and the floors were not sticky.  This will be our go to Indian food place!!  Also, the owner (I think) wrote me a nice email in response to my review.  He apologized for my experience and invited me to come back to the restaurant.  It is nice to have an owner who reads reviews, cares, and responds.    This restaurant's lunch buffet certainly deserves a solid 4-star rating based on food alone.  Unfortunately, the floors were so sticky that I lost a shoe when I was waiting in line and went to take a step.  My shoe was solidly pasted to the floor.  It was embarrassing and appetite killing.  Also, the chairs at our table were so wobbly that I pinched a finger while trying to scoot in my chair...on second thought, maybe my chair was pasted to the floor too.  I would like to visit this restaurant again since I enjoyed the food;hopefully I will be able to rate restaurant with a higher rating."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed ourselves here last night. From the moment we stepped inside the service was impeccable - you can tell these guys are really serious. The menu is huge with dozens of dishes I have never encountered. Being our first visit we kept things simple with coconut chicken curry. Their hot sauce is wonderful, as is the unleavened bread and the hot carrots they start you out with. I will return. (FYI don't let the yelp picture fool you - the buffet is only available at lunch time)"}
{"text":"Sooooo..... I can't believe that it has taken me THIS long to update my review here. So long in fact that I cannot remember the last time I went. All I know is that my second dining experience with roaches was enough to seal the deal - not ever coming back here again. Which is a shame because I've yet to find another buffet that compares in terms of flavor. But if flavor has to come with a roach crawling around the silverware (YES.. the SILVERWARE) or on a wall beside me while employees just watch it... I'd just rather not.  Now granted my last experience was some time ago (some months after the decor was updated and walls went from yellow to blue) but considering the last report of a roach sighting was three months ago, their health inspections I very easily googled all report problems with roaches or roach powder on the premises, and I saw them two separate times?? Not likely changing.   Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"First time here. Very, VERY good food in the buffet (chicken makhani, paneer tikka masala, palak paneer, kheer, etc.) but a bit disappointed that they wouldn't give me a small box to take the little leftovers on my plate home (hate being wasteful.)"}
{"text":"Back east where we're from, we eat Indian regularly and frequent many Indian restaurants. So it was surprising to find a really good one right in Scottsdale. Their food and service was as good as we get back in DC or Baltimore where there are 20 plus Indian restaurants. Plus their prices are great."}
{"text":"Good food, nice service, prices were decent. The decor and bathrooms could use some work. Overall good experience.  We would visit again."}
{"text":"Before eating at Indian Paradise, I couldn't say I had ever eaten Indian Food while listening to 90's techno... but that's all changed now. I can't explain the staff's choice of music the night I visited Indian Paradise, but it made for interesting ambiance. Maybe Aloo Mattar just tastes better to the tune of \"Sandstorm\" by Darude?  I found this place while on a mad hunt to satisfy an Indian food craving. I swear, when that hits me, I can think of little else. It's nestled in the heart of what seems like Chandler's Chinatown, and took some effort to find. I'm sure that's more due to my poor sense of direction. The decor was minimal (and I don't mean minimalist- just white walls and not much else).   The food was good and the service was attentive. I've had better garlic naan, but it surely wasn't bad. The portion sizes were generous enough for my sister and I to split our dishes and still have some leftovers.   I'll be back for sure, but I'm still happy trying other Indian places in the valley. Haven't found one I'm completely loyal to yet..."}
{"text":"Not the best Indian I've had. Naan was burned. Buffet was ok. Tandoori chicken was good."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time having lunch actually on Thanksgiving Day.  They upcharged us for the buffet but didn't offer the champagne it was supposed to include.  We were told it only included the sweat mango tea over at the buffet.  It wasn't until I read other reviews & remembered when we came two years ago we were supposed to get champagne also.  The walls are painted a deep blue, & we feel that it really ruins the atmosphere & it not conducive to dining.  As it is Indian food, the walls should be painted a deep hue, like orange/red.  It needs a good redo.  I am making a note not to return because the interior just makes me feel lousy when I eat there.  The food is ok, not great.  If they redecorated, the food would probably taste better to me.    We are usually there over vacation periods, hence that is why we ended up there twice on Thanksgiving.    It's ok, just kind of a strange decor & not appealing to me."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers, for another great restaurant recommendation! The BF and I went last night and really enjoyed our dinner. First of all, the service was excellent, everyone was so kind and attentive.   I've only been to Indian restaurants a handful of times and each of those times was with \"experienced\" Indian restaurant-goers, so I was a little intimidated to be in charge of ordering (my bf has never had Indian food before). To be safe, I ordered the \"classics\": Lamb masala, palak paneer (spinach and tofu), and daal makhni (lentils)... they were all delicious! The masala was probably our favorite. The rice and naan (we got the garlic) were both great with our saucy dishes. Bf had the Himalayan beer (nice a light) and I had the strawberry lassi. I love the sweet, yogurty tartness of it with the flavorful spiciness of the dishes.   My boyfriend also tried the \"Red Chili Pickles\" that were advertised at the table. His order was met with raised eyebrows and an \"are you sure?\" by our server. What we got were not even remotely close to what we know to be pickles... my best guess is maybe some type of bean curd wrapped in chili skin. It was more salty than spicy (hence the pickle name?). We asked our server what it was and he said he had no idea and had never had it before. Ha! They seemed very impressed that my bf ate the \"pickles\".   I've successfully introduced and converted my boyfriend into an Indian food lover. We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Indian buffet. Plenty of seating. Good service, I'd recommend to a friend, definitely worth a try and the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Very delicious! Thought since it was only a few miles away from my place, I'd grab a bit and see how it was. Lovely and flavorful! Also - the staff is really friendly. I like when managers or waiters come up and ask how everything is.. You can tell they take a lot of pride in their food! :)"}
{"text":"Still fantastic buffet!  They have a great way of blending the spices & food was delicious. They now serve Mango Lassi which is a perfect addition to the palate. Good service & comfortable surroundings. The food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  Also just got an A+ rating from the health department.  Always a plus to know the kitchen is clean.  Wonderful selection and fair priced."}
{"text":"Came in during lunch for the buffet. I was expecting the standard buffet items (which they had) but I also saw a few things that are not. Always a fan of Chicken Tikka Masala they also had a Paneer version, yum! They had some really good seasoned roasted jalapenos that made a great addition to the plate, added nice heat and flavor to the dishes. In addition to the naan on the table they also offered Puri at the buffet. This was a nice option.  The desert was different, it was white and had a distinct rosewater flavor to the syrup.  I am used to the softer donut hole type, Gulab Jamun, in a cardamon honey syrup.  This I have come to find out was Rasgulla. I definite enjoyed the variety and the quality of the food. Not enough for 4 stars but I would go back if in the area and craving Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"This place is a true hidden jem. You are first greeted  by extremely friendly staff. This place is very clean and don't be fooled by the out side the inside is beautifully done. They are very Kid friendly. The buffet on a Sunday was very nice and it comes with Champagne. The buffet has plenty of options that were fresh and didn't taste microwaved. They bring you nice and warm fresh garlic nann. The chicken tiki masala is my favorite it's so yummy. The drinks are served in glass and the tables are table clothed. They have a nice custard at the end that was really refreshing.  Our servers name was sheeba was excellent."}
{"text":"If you are coming for atmosphere then move along. When we visited on a Saturday night a few weeks back we were the only diners eating in the restaurant for the 1st 30 mins of our meal!   But frankly who cares. I am a nut for Chicken Tikka Masala and this place does the best in the Valley period. The Naan bread was maybe a little too dry but what did I care when I was dipping it in such deliciousness!  I won't go anywhere else for Indian food now."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch buffet on a Saturday based on Yelp reviewers and wasn't disappointed.  This was really good and tasty Indian food.  Normally I'm not a big fan of buffets, but as this seemed to be the only option at lunch we went for it and weren't disappointed.  The curry goat, palak paneer and paneer tikka masala were all outstanding.  The naan was also very good as well as the rice pudding dessert.  I didn't think this was overpriced at all for what you got but haven't see what you get for hte dinner entrees.  The atmosphere is a little cold, but htey had music playing and bollywood on the TV.  The service was prompt and attentive, if a little distanced.  We will definately be back."}
{"text":"Info to help out:  Lunch Buffet: Tuesday to Friday 11am till 2:30pm Saturday Noon till 3pm Closed on Mondays  Indian Paradise is a solid choice for a Lunch Buffet.  We really appreciate that they offer complementary Mango Lassi (you serve yourself at the buffet) and Chai tea (ask your waitress) with your meal.  They even bring warm, fresh Naan to your table.  The buffet has a wide selection with a variety of vegetarian dishes to choose from as well as those containing meat.  In addition to the typical items, they have soups, desserts, and many dips to choose from.  One of my favorite items offered was a medium spicy pepper dipped in ground chick peas, stuffed with a small amount of cheese, and then fried.  My favorite dish is the Chicken Curry made with dark meat that has an amazing flavor.  My wife's favorite dish is the Paneer Tikka Masala; she would like to see the sauce with a little more flavor, but loves the taste and cook of the Paneer."}
{"text":"Good location and broad range of choices on the buffett.  Service was adequate, price wasn't too bad, and a few of the buffett items were quite good.  Only downsides I've experienced are the occasional use of french fries on the buffett as \"vegetable pakoras\".  Unacceptable.  Also, not all of the buffett selections were put out and I was there a good 30 minutes after opening."}
{"text":"I came in here for a co-workers birthday lunch, and I was very impressed with the place.  First off, you can't beat the $8.99 lunchtime buffet.  They had your traditional Indian offerings out there, such as curry chicken and tandoori chicken, along with some others options that those who might be more versed in Indian cuisine might give a try.  The Naan was crisp and our basket kept getting refilled as it became empty.  The service was a little slow, even though it was a buffet, but since I work in the area I see myself coming back here time and time again for lunch."}
{"text":"Great place to have great Indian food! Nice atmosphere and music and fantastic food! I love this place the waitress was so sweet! Just Excellent!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! I'm from out of town and I decided to check this place out for dinner to curb my Indian food craving. I don't get Indian food very often because I live in a small town and the nearest place is over an hour away. With that being said, I ordered a ridiculous amount of food for just little me. I started off with the onion Bhaji and they were cooked perfectly!! Crunchy on the outside and flavorful on the inside. Next I had the chicken vindoloo at a medium spice which was perfect for my tastebuds! The chicken was tender and the seasoning was spot on! I can't eat Indian food without garlic naan so of course I ordered that too. The naan had a perfect amount of garlic and was both crunchy and soft. This was the best meal I had all week!! Of course I took some back to the hotel too.    Check it out, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite! The service has always been incredible and everything on the menu is great. We love the tikka masala and the dal. Great naan and samosas. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Tasty, Tasty! I haven't had good Indian food since I was in Seattle last winter. Indian Paradise was a great surprise. I read everyone's reviews on here about it, and since it is close to my work, decided to stop by for the lunch buffet. It was so good, flavorful with a good selection and they place had an understated atmosphere. The staff was very nice. They lunch buffet costs around $9 and an entree costs around $12. The meat is pretty good quality, though there is that is some fat in it but you can pick it out quite easily. The chicken tikki Marsala is to die for!"}
