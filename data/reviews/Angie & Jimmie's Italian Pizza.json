{"text":"the XL pie is the biggest on the planet its great pizza love the wings aswell who cares about the area ? It's about the food!"}
{"text":"Wife and I had the pizza and buffalo wings. The pizza was expertly handcrafted, some of the best we've had in years. The wings were crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and the buffalo sauce was a great blend of tart and heat. Definitely coming back again, and soon."}
{"text":"Go there for the pizza, not the wings. At least that's what I remember the last time I ordered wings there. Another restaurant that makes a huge batch of wings, lets them sit and dry out, then reheats and sells them as they go.

Their pizza on the other hand is fantastic."}
{"text":"Pizza and garlic cheese bread is great however I recommend getting it to go. Service in the dine in restaurant is poor to mediocre.. :/"}
{"text":"This place has the best sandwiches ever and is home of the stop sign pizza. 

There is nothing special about the sandwiches but, damn they are good. The fresh italian bread, the juice cuts of meat. This sandwich (the one I get) had italian dressing, mayo, lettuce, tomatoe, no onion turkey, black forest ham and cheese. You also get some pepperchinis on the side. Like I said nothing special, but still there is something about the meat and the fresh brad that totally makes this sandwich. 
The stop sign pizza is great for a family or a get to gather. Literally the size of a stop sign. It's like 35ish dollars and you have to pre-order it but it has like 30-40 slices (squared). 
Been going here for the past 12 years. I do only get the ham and turkey sandwich and have to admit that I have not had any of the other sandwiches. I do hear that the other selections are good too. 
The place may look a little scary, both the neighborhood and the inside. Don't let it turn you off to this place. Give it a try"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Angie & Jimmies, I gotta say, in over 10 years and it is still as good now as it was back then!! Made an order for delivery today....  pizza, mild wings and a sub.  Our food arrived pretty quickly, the driver took my sub with him when he left the restaurant, but forgot to leave it with me.... so I had to call them back, but they had him return within 10 mins.  My sub was hugenormous!!! Enough for a couple people or even a few different meals. The pizza was delish and the wings were meaty, crispy and tasty!  No complaints here! Prices are good, food is awesome! I have been to their location, I agree with everyone else, parking is bad, the location looks scary and its small, BUT it is a diamond in the rough!! Try it out, you won't be disappointed!!  Definitely adding Angie & Jimmies to our favorites!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for great authentic style pizza, wings, and subs, come and enjoy a warm family oriented restaurant in the heart of Phoenix.  Are you tired of the artificiality of the popular food chains, come and enjoy a unique experience at Angie and Jimmy's.  The pizza and wings is the hot commodity, due to taste and daily specials, yet Angie and Jimmy's also provide a variety of authentic subs.  The interior design is layered with precious Elvis artifacts, which is the reason why some people come in and dine in the first place.  Once there however, it is hard to not fall in love with anything and everything you eat.  Yet, if you can't make it to the restaurant, Angie and Jimmy's cater to parties and local events.  So if you can't enjoy the fun from the inside, Angie and Jimmy's lets you take it outside."}
{"text":"I keep searching for a sandwich that can top the A + J \"Super Sub,\" but I don't know why, because it's not f*cking possible.  It can feed a family of four for $10.  You can use it as a pillow.  It might stop bullets.  I'm not sure."}
{"text":"Though I've never eaten there I have had delivery and take out. Every time its as good as the first. Must try the ravioli! And their personal pizza is great since I don't eat much and hate ordering a whole pizza to myself. Oh and they have great customer service. Thank you!"}

{"text":"Just went to the New Angie's & Jimmies  location on 7620 E Bell Road Suite 2. I am excited about this location it is closer to home and as alway pizza and wing are the best in town hands down. If you are looking for a new pizza joint to eat at give it a try. I've been eating Angie's & jimmies at least 20+ years."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp. It's a small place. Not the cleanest, actually dirty. The pink lemonade machine was out. The lady at the counter was coughing and unprofessional. But the food was delicious. We ordered wings and three personal pizzas, which were pretty big for being personal."}
{"text":"This place has amazing pizza and wings for a great price. My only complaint is they are closed on Sundays?! Any pizza place not open on Sundays doesn't care to make money. My business goes elsewhere since Sundays are my days for pizza or wings.."}
{"text":"I've been coming to angie's and jimmie's for years. I have about it all the time. Was so sad cause I went to stop by and they were closed. So you'd imagine how excited I was to find out they moved. Although their new staff needs some guidance... Please support this amazing local business... Pizza is great and so are the sandwiches! Wings are always good too, just ask for double cooked!!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in town in this price range hands down. A&J's is superior to all of the pizza places in Tempe (now that Tessio's is gone) and everything we have tried so far in Phoenix / Mesa / Scottsdale. I've tried convincing the owners they need to open a Tempe location. They would dominate. Their portions are completely out of control, the sandwiches are enormous. The marinara here is also noteworthy. Soooo tasty. The service and delivery times have always been on par. The sausage they use for the pizza topping is remarkable. I'm not even a sausage guy, but it must be consumed at least once a week. Usually Wednesday. If you are looking for pizza, this is the place, even if it means a drive from Tempe."}
{"text":"They don't wear hair nets and I found a hair in my food, they also aren't washing there hands when they get done anwser phones and they also don't wear gloves  it's actually really gross"}

{"text":"Tom and the family has eatten from here othen,,,,delivery takes a while,but food is Ok"}
{"text":"I walked in and saw Courage the Cowardly Dog drawn on the chalk board, so I knew this was going to be good. The place looks like your typical hole in the wall pizza place that turns out to have damn good food. 

I had a pepperoni with my girlfriend and my dad, and has some wings to boot. I went back a second time and will continue to go back again.

The place is like stepping foot into a time machine. They've got the old Atari arcade games, a pinball machine, and they have tables with a built in checkers boards. It's like the stereotypical pizza place you see in the 80s movies. 

Only thing that bothered me was some fat guy staring at me while eating his pizza, I don't know. I'm open to the possibility that I resemble food as well. Other than that, the customer service is pretty good despite the fact that they seem busy, the food is awesome, the atmosphere is pretty relaxed and not too loud, and overall a good experience. 

Only reason I gave it 4 stars was because there seems to be a weird film on the tables, could just be the finish on the tables wearing out or something. I don't know, but it's not THAT big of a problem."}
{"text":"Been going here for over 15+ years. Hands down my favorite wings in town. I love the pizza and atmosphere inside. Classic neighborhood pizza joint with great food and customer service. Only downside is the past 2 years, price has been slowing increasing. But in my opinion its worth it"}
{"text":"Had my first bad experience with this place tonight. After I ordered two pizzas for delivery the girl who answered the phone told me my card was declined. I had just used the same card to buy groceries. This was after she told me I had to order two larges because they don't do mediums anymore. I used the same card almost immediately afterward at another pizza place with no issues. Too bad. I had high hopes for them after they moved away from the porno store in Indian school. 

Update:  I had a few orders filled successfully over the last few weeks, so I thought they were on the right track. Tonight I called them and they said they were out of this topping or that so I finally ordered something I didn't want. Over an hour went by and the delivery guy hadn't showed up so I called and they had totally lost our order. This place has really gone downhill. Sad."}
{"text":"For the record, I'm the world's worst vegetarian. Well, pescetarian, but yelp doesn't think that's a real word. Whatever. I'm bad at all of it. I have a weakness for wings. 

What's even worse is that I didn't even KNOW i had this weakness until Jetta R and Amanda B decided to pray upon it by taking me to Angie and Jimmie's. The wings were already on the table when I walked in the door. I never stood a chance. Just like the bacon on Christmas morning. Don't judge me. 

The interior, pizza and ambiance are questionable at best. Those other reviews are SO NOT LYING about the plastic furniture. Which is weird, since the serving plates are those trendy square ones in earth tones. Extra points for not having enough parking spaces - thus resulting in us parking in the lot for the porn store next door. If I was half the pig I'm willing to admit I'd take sick joy in that juxtaposition. 

But you didn't come to A&J for the pizza. You didn't come here to impress a date. You came here for wings. Because you trust me to send you to good wings. And Angie and Jimmie's knows wings. They know them like Jetta R. knows wrestling and B movies. They know them so well they taught ME to love wings. And to question my entire veg-leaning lifestyle. 

Damn you, Angie and Jimmies. I have to rethink my entire outlook on food because of you. Maybe I should mull over what I'm doing with my life over another order of mediums with squeeze bottle ranch..."}
{"text":"I had the italian sub was huge! Wings simply perfect!"}
{"text":"I recently ordered delivery from angie and jimmies and had a small issue with the Bill and my card used but I called and spoke to Carl and he took great care of me he is a stand up guy and awesome food as well the wings are fresh and juicy and great fr#@king subs"}
{"text":"After reading several good reviews about this restaurant, I decided to try it out.

First of all I don't judge a book by its cover, however as a restaurant I think there could have been more attention given to the look of the establishment, after all a first impression is a lasting impression.

We ordered a simple medium two topping pizza with pepperoni and bell peppers. Initially when I opened the box at home, I was wondering where the bell peppers were. Half of the pizza was cheese and pepperoni and the other had scarce amounts of bell peppers on it.  

Now to the meat and potatoes. At first bite I was in love. The amount of flavor that it has is tremendous. I still cant believe how great it tasted. Also if you are a fan of thick crusts look no further. The actual pie itself was a little thin, however the flavor made up for that.

All in all I do like a good pizza, and they did well on the flavor. However the lack of toppings, dismal restaurant appearance, and overall cost could definitely be approved."}
{"text":"Huge servings! Great price! More GCU students should come here! I approve! If you have 8 bucks grab the pizza sub! It's YUMAZING! Top ten hole-in-the-wall!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches there huge. I got a pizza and it was cooked perfect, perfect cheese, sauce was perfect. My girlfriend got the turkey sub it was huge and looked perfect I will recommend this to all my friends."}
{"text":"There is nothing fancy about this place at all.  No signage, limited parking, a squeeze bottle of ranch on the table, and its in a shady area I use to call home.  All of that being said they make some of the best pies in the Phoenix Metro area.  The secret is that they only use fresh ingredients to prepare all of their food.

From the dough in the pizza, to the fresh cut romaine lettuce for their salads, to a simple fresh cut potato for french fries.  It is all fresh and cared for.  The people at A&J's love food and it shows.  

Here are some of the best pizza places in town.  Pizzarie Bianco, Cibo, Pizza A Metro, and A&J's.  Notice that none of these are chains?  Also notice all of these make their own dough fresh and get great ingredients for toppings?  Lastly notice that none of these places are anywhere near, Scottsdale, Chandler, Gilbert, Tempe, or any other strip mall infested east side suburb.

Get your butts to downtown, uptown, and the west side for real food with soul and flavor.

That is all."}
{"text":"My boyfriend recommended we pick up from here because he come here when he was younger. We ordered the ol pizza and wings last night. A great deal for a large- and I mean large pizza(Hawaiian) and 12 wings(mild) for $21.

The pizza crust was was bland like no salt was added what so ever and too chewy. Very light on the sauce. The toppings were good but too few, an average of maybe 3 small wedges of pineapple on a slice(keep in mind a huge slice). Maybe it was an off batch of dough but I won't order another pizza from here.

The wings were not your typical breaded or bathing sauce. They were crispy and good quality. But the sauce was all on the bottom of the container and the wings were well naked. If they would have actually mixed the wings with the sauce they would have been bomb.com

And the ranch meh, I've had better since it kind of tasted like the low fat hidden valley ranch."}
{"text":"I don't care what the people who write about the neighborhood and the parking this is the best pizza and subs spot in AZ. If you are in central Phoenix looking for a gourmet pizzeria then that is your problem. The staff here are great down to earth people. The food is always great and cooked just the way it should be and the prices are awesome. You know a place is good when it is always filled and the cops and firefighters eat there."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time tonight and will definitely go back. The service was prompt and the food was delicious. I was a bit wary at first because of its location but I am making this my go to location for cheap pizza."}
{"text":"Only after years of eating chain type sandwiches could I fully appreciate the quality and size of the sandwiches this place offers. I am a 6 foot 7 man who likes to eat good and cheap. The problem with most places is that they are more focused on the extras such as extra cheese or meat. 

Now I have always thought it was a scam to charge for something that you already paid for in the first place (extra cheese on a pizza). But when I go to a place that not only gives me more meat than there is bread I have to say yes!! This made up for all the overpriced, under sized, untasty sandwiches I have had to consume over the years. No more meatballs the size of a marble, or cold cuts that are coated in some kind of weird slime from sitting out to long. 

No this place gives you what you order, a sub made of more meat than found in a whole deli counter (lol). I could care less about the cheap chairs or the location of the place, I just always wondered how they made any money with such huge portions at such low prices? The wings are good as everyone else has already stated and the pizza is tasty every time. If you are looking for a up scale place with cloth napkins, and waiters who see you as only a $5 tip then PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS Place!!! 

Let those who enjoy good, affordable food come here and feast on common fare. I am sure you will be to busy counting your millions to even make the drive to west Phoenix anyway."}
{"text":"Okay, let's just lay this on the table. This place IS a dive. It's nestled between a Circle K and a porn shop. It looks like it hasn't been painted since day one. The seating is mostly patio furniture. And it's not the first place that comes to mind when you think, \"Hey, I want pizza.\"

And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. 

Dives are great. They lack pretension and when done right, are hidden gems in a sea of the same old, same old.

You get a lot of bang for your buck at Angie & Jimmie's. The pizza is hot and fresh. The wings are HUGE and you get plenty of them. A small order of fries comes out on a big plate. The staff is friendly and accommodating. 

Come to think of it, if you go enough, it MIGHT end up being the first place you think of when you want pizza.

Give it a try. It won't disappoint you."}
{"text":"I've lived here for 18 years never heard of this place. Great NY style pizza. Kinda like NYPD pizza on a good day. Very different style crust. Solid place. Go."}
{"text":"I love the food here but these young servers suck!! The only good server here is Beth and they don't even have her serving anymore :("}
{"text":"Went to A&J on Indian School. First time there.
The location could have been better in appearance and cleanliness.
Got a medium Pizza with Pepperoni and green bell peppers. Toppings are a dollar each! And I was a bit disappointed, the pizza just had a few of each.
It was also flat&soggy. But the season in the marinara was tasty."}
{"text":"An ex boyfriend of mine introduced me to this place and I can tell you that's the best thing he ever did for me. Yup, this place is a total dive. Do not be afraid to get out of your car as you maneuver your way into the parking lot. Nestled in between a sheisty Circle K and an Adult Shoppe (or something) Angie & Jimmie's will NOT disappoint. If you're in the mood for some tasty slices of pizza or wings, this is the place for you. Truth be told,  I'm not really a fan of their sandwiches because they have too much meat on them for my liking (but others might see this as an endearing quality in a sub sandwich.) Oh and whatever you do, don't forget to grab a cannoli...or six! Or twenty seven."}
{"text":"Great Pizza & Fries.  This is old school and we have been going here since 1997.  We take everyone we know to Angie & Jimmie's and they walk away saying the same thing.  Great Pizza !"}
{"text":"My favorite place
Thank you for always giving us a great family nights
The wings are amazing
The sandwiches are sooo good
And of course the pizza is always fantastic"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Nestled between a convenience store and an adult book store on Indian School and 31st Ave., you'll miss it if you don't know to look for it.  I was introduced to Angie's & Jimmie's by a co-worker, and I am so grateful!  This place is a dive, but the food is awesome, the waitstaff are friendly, and you get a ton of food for a tiny price!  I ordered the hot turkey and cheese sub.  I wish I had known to order the half sub, because the whole sub was ENORMOUS.  I was hard-pressed to finish half, and the other made for a very filling dinner later that night.  The fresh cut fries are wonderfully seasoned, and one serving is more than enough for two people to split.  My co-worker ordered the small order of wings (12) , expecting your run-of-the mill bite-sized wings, but what she got was a heaping plate of HUGE wings.  She was able to get through four of them.  As if that weren't enough, this place offers a monster-sized 28\" pizza!  The same co-worker and I are heading back there today, and I'm looking forward to enjoying some pizza.  And fries, of course!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to check out this place and after our fine meal we grabbed a movie and a butt plug from the porn shop next door, then went to Circle-K which is also next door (A&J's is right between the two) and made our last purchase of a couple Old English 40's. We then headed home to finish off what obviously was an amazing evening.

Ha ha, but in all seriousness, this place is great. The pizza is nothing short of fabulous and the prices are very reasonable. And people say the decor isn't good? It's perfect! There are a number of old Elvis posters taped up near the high ceiling, some of which are crooked, plastic chairs are carefully organized around each table, the lighting consists of (energy/environmentally friendly florescent) light bulbs hanging by their wires from the ceiling, and to top it off the windows are tinted by means of taped up sheets of tint plastic for the comfort of the diner. I wouldn't have it any other way. Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"My first time eating. Husband recommend and after receiving the service at the counter, by owner, decided to dine in.  Pizza was wonderful and wings really good too.  Loved the family atmosphere and looking forward to next visit.   Prices are very fair. Giant Pizza is crazy LARGE!!!!
Owner is very friendly. Appreciated his service!'"}
{"text":"This place needs to be on The Food Network show, \"Restaurant: IMPOSSIBLE\" ... I need to remind myself not to eat here in the future unless its free... and even then."}
{"text":"I have to come to understand and accept that I am probably the reason restaurateurs  hate yelpers.

I just have no appreciation for atmosphere. I know this because during my 12-day stay in the Bay area, the word had to be repeatedly hammered into my brain, as the natives could not understand how I could merely judge a restaurant's merit based solely on their cuisine. 

Eventually they wrote me off as a lost cause, chalking up my dis-appreciation of fine decor and tacky acoustic music as a symptom of being Phoenician. 

For a while I was confused. I didn't know what was wrong with me. Was I just impossible to please? Had I no taste for aesthetics? Oh shit, I have no aesthetic sensibility. I'm an art major. What does that mean for me?

All I have is a clock radio. Who am I Mommy?

I was beginning to have some serious doubts about my aptitude for critique. 

Sweet Zombie Jesus. Maybe I didn't know what I was talking about all this time.

After all, Angie and Jimmie's is as far from atmosphere as you could be. Like, as far as John Cage is from actual music, or Miley Cyrus from being talented. 

Fun Fact: While in San Carlos we saw a guy parked underneath a Miley Cyrus billboard giving himself some of the old \"self-service at the pump\". True story.

There are no polished tables and cushy chairs at A&J's. No, instead they have those all-plastic all-purpose chairs that last you years and years sitting in your backyard until you invite that one plus-sized friend of yours who sits in it and bends it in such a way that is is never usable again. 

And there is no ambient music. Only the sounds of the arcade machines and the TV, which no matter what time of day is always playing a crime drama. Or a Billy Mays infomercial.

 \"HI BILLY MAYS HERE BUY SOME FUCKING OXI-CLEAN OR I'LL SHOVE SOME MIGHTY PUTTY UP YOUR ASS WHILE I BANG YOUR WIFE!\"

The staff at A&J care as much about presentation as Fred Phelps does about receiving a box set of \"The L Word\" for Christmas.

Their wings are not soaked in the sauce (BBW calls the process \"spinning\") like at other joints. No, the wings are cooked, and then, the sauce is poured over them. At first you're like \"this is fucking shady, I am not pleased with this\", but when you can actually taste the chicken, and dont' have to ask for like fifty extra napkins, you find you might actually walk away from the table with some dignity. 

Try saying the same thing after paying 9 bucks for half a sandwich while ten pounds of bitch in a five pound bag asks you if you have room for dessert.

The subs are meaty and quite sustaining. So I've heard. I have a rule about ordering shit that isn't on the sign. I've never ordered a cheeseburger at Del Taco or chicken nuggets at a Red Lobster, and here I am, still alive and kicking. The system works.

The pizza is simply fucking fabulous. It's crispy but never crunchy, hot but never molten, and cheesy but never \"hey, how long are you going to be on the toilet? I need to take a shower\" cheesy. Honestly, the only pizza I've had in Phoenix that even compares to it is Pizza A Metro...which is another small independently owned pizza shop crammed next to a Circle K...

...

Maybe it isn't me. Maybe it's just Phoenix. Or just the west side of it. Everything's backwards here. It's like Bizarro world.

All the best food is located in these hole-in-the-walls, where the decor is haphazard the menus have to be laminated because people are always spilling shit on them. 

There's still a pretty good chance that I'm a tasteless Philistine, but we're  in Bizarro World and that makes me a learned connoisseur of wealth and taste. 

I fucking love it here."}
{"text":"Best.Wings.Ever.
Crisp. Great flavor. What's not to love?
Pizza was ok; just wish they put way more toppings on it.
They forgot my sandwich order, which was fine because they discounted the rest of my order. So, they \"made it right\" by me.....but I REALLY wanted to try the sandwich. =)
From the outside, the place looks intimidating; I wondered if they were even open for business. On the inside, don't expect much but a functional seating area. But who needs fancy seating and decor when you have FANTASTIC WINGS?!?!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab Pizza, Wings, Sub yes I said Sub the Super Sub is Heaven sent. Brownies are a must. Been going here for years good lunch special's and very friendly. I wish they would deliver to Goodyear..."}
{"text":"I got the wings. Great Sauce. Crispy Wings. The only let down was the price. $14 for a dozen wings seems a little steep. Thats like Room Service Prices."}
{"text":"This is the best sub shop in the Valley hands down. Outstanding value! Go hungry...leave stuffed!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza. I've been going here for years, I even followed them when they moved. Excellent service every time!"}
{"text":"Pretty great pizza! Don't let the divey location discourage you. What they lack in ambiance, they make up for in quality and price. The wings were good but the pizza was great. They were a little skimpy on the meat but at only $1 per topping, I guess I shouldn't complain. I may have finally found my regular pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Great every time! Absolutely our go-to joint when we want good pizza. Wings are great too! Don't let the location stop you."}
{"text":"I have to say this place is so so good. They don't have a sign with the name of there buisness outside of the place and its freakin ugly on the ouside and next to a porn shop and a circle K, but of my god  they have good food. The pizza is great, good crust (NY style), good sauce and good toppings. The wings are great and they are huge. The sandwiches are the same way huge and delicious. Dont let the location or the outside fool you. Inside not much to talk about but just try it you will be happy! This place has been here for over 25 years."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and really inexpensive too.  Great find."}
{"text":"This will be my first 1 star review. This place is a freaking JOKE! We are working over at GCU for their graduations. Every day I order food for my team, and pizza is usually the best option. We tried calling yesterday and never got anyone to answer the phone. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried again today. I called at 10:16am, 16 minutes after they opened. I ordered 2 large pepperonis, an all meat, and one with bacon, mushrooms, and jalapeños. When I placed the order I asked the guy SPECIFICALLY if he knew where the loading dock of the arena was. He assured me he knew exactly where it was. I was told 45 minutes and wasn't given a total. This was AFTER I asked if they had any specials, to which the answer was no. Whatever. After 1 hour and 5 minutes I decided to give them a courtesy call. The lady that answered the phone ask for the name and address. She had no clue. Then she asked what I ordered and replied \"Oh that's already on its way, hun!\" Great. Keep in mind this place was only .2 miles away and I should have sent one of my people over to pick it up, but you know, we have work to do. 10 minutes go by. 20 minutes. I call. Busy. I call at 25 min. Busy. I call at 30 min (now 1 hour and 30 minutes). Busy. Also keep in mind they have my phone number. They have my name. I was assured they knew where we were. I altered to security and even bought them a pizza for helping us out. I even left a radio with security so they could call me the minute it arrived. I call back and it FINALLY RINGS! Nobody answered, so I say \"Hello? Hello?\" I can hear some guy ordering a salad with his pizza. I believe he wanted Italian dressing and no onions. I kept waiting for someone to answer and maybe put me on hold. Nope. THEY HUNG UP THE PHONE! I never even got to speak with anyone!!! At TWO HOURS AND FIVE MINUTES the security control center is notified by a guard 2 block away that they have pizzas for Ken and where do they go. Are you freaking kidding me? THEN the driver actually asked the guard if there was going to be a tip?!?! After he was informed that probably wouldn't happen for taking 2 hours, plus the fact that the guard wasn't authorized to even sign my MY CREDIT CARD, the driver informed the guard that if I wanted to leave a tip, they were right down the road and I could drop one off! Am I seriously being punked? WHAT? Then I check my credit card to see if they even charged me for it. $60 for cold hard pizza ANDA THEY GOT IT WRONG!!!! No mushrooms, only bacon and jalapeños. 60 freaking dollars for a horrible experience. I cannot believe these guys are in business. I'm assuming the only reason is they are located next to a college and can get away with horrible service. What a freaking joke this place is. NEVER AGAIN!!! EVER!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Got to share their subs and fries,unless you are really hungry"}

Outside the NY TriState Area (or Chicago, and maybe Florida), this kind of awesome is hard to find. The neighborhood is at the epicenter of a serious urban nightmare.  Like a \"demilitarized zone\" as Egon Spengler put it. Very well could get accosted by semi-naked drifters with dogs.  Sandwiched between a porn store and a tiny Circle K.  West Central Phoenix.  Social decay.  Try a nice stroll down the street one night...late.
Amazingly awesome Italian food. Tremendous portions. These people know what's up, and the surroundings give it a charm that has to be experienced.  Slammed busy for lunch normally, they are quieter in the evenings.  It is just North of an Industrial area of Phoenix, so clientele run the gamut. I have seen quite a few cops and firefighters in there.  If you know what good pizza tastes like, this place is gold.  The wings...meh, but who cares?  Giant pizzas, overflowing heros (with a nice little pepperoncini placed in the foil), all at reasonable prices.  Television, pinball, and copies of the New Times."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches and wings, the super sub is amazing and quality of food always great. I wish they would put a place farther west!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place looks bad!

The parking is horrendous and the restaurant is located in an extremely shady looking strip mall.

I walk in and it looks equally as shady and crappy as the exterior.

However, we ordered our food \"to go\" and it was waiting for us when we arrived.  There was a nice woman behind the front counter taking orders and handling transactions.

I was surprised when I saw the size of my Italian combo sandwich.  It was freaking huge!  I only managed to eat half of it.

My only complaint is that their cannolis weren't very good and the powdered sugar spilled inside my car.

I would definitely recommend this place.  They make some of the best sandwiches I have had since moving to Arizona."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall=most delish pizza.  Can't wait to go back and try the wings.  Although a little disappointed they no longer serve beer."}
{"text":"Didnt order anything super complicated just a cheese pie and a single salad but what it was simple and amazing!   The the salad was full of turkey and vegies the blue cheese tasted homemade!   The pizza rivaled east coast!  Way to bring it!  Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall- with THE BEST DAMN PIZZA  I've had in the 25 plus years I've lived in AZ!!!!!!  Wings are Ok, Sandwichs are OK, Fries are OK but you go here for the P I Z Z A!!!!   I work down town, live out west and drive 5 miles out of my way to take home a pie......or two."}
{"text":"I'm from Ny so I'm very picky when it comes to my pizzas! And i would rate the pizza 3 stars we got a large cheese pizza the crust was very good lacking on the sauce and personally i didn't like how the cheese smelled. Also orderd a delux salad and that was amazing huge salad lots of meat and cheese to match the amount of salad i ate the entire salad in three sittings . It was also reasonably priced for a delux salad and large cheese it only came out to $20.50. And that's what makes it 4 stars for me . I would definitely eat the food again !"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great as are the wings that supply ranch in a form that doesn't get your fingers too messy. I have been back a couple times and the pizza isn't the best but the other items on the menu are worth a trip to Angie's and Jimmies"}
{"text":"Yes, it looks bad from the outside. Suck it up and give it a try. This is in my hood so the location doesn't bother me. It's a diamond in the rough. 

Pizza is delicious, prices are fantastic, and the family vibe makes it all better."}
{"text":"Still good food, but evidently the So Cal \"transplant\" definition of \"dive\" is a little different than the definition Phoenicians use. My bad."}
{"text":"Something is wrong with you if you don't like their pizza! It's straight up pizza the way it should be made. Nothing like any chain restaurants. More like italian style. You can beat the price and quality! Are you reviewing their food or the location, who cares! You need to try it!"}
{"text":"I happened to be downtown and came here based on yelp reviews.  It is right next to a circle k and a little bit off the  corner of 32nd Ave and Indian School Road.  The prices are excellent.  The owners did not know they were even on yelp until I mentioned it.  The cannolis are only 75 cents and are awesome.  The large pizza is only $13.00 and their foot long loaded sub is only $10.00.  The Pizza reminded me of pizza I used to eat when I lived in New York.  Their brownies are little too sweet.  Great pizza, next time I will try the calzones and the pasta.  It is a Dive and seats are not very clean.  The pizza and food is amazing."}
{"text":"I've  liked Angie and jimmies been eating here a little over 10 years. Located close to my office and they deliver which is convenient. I order the steak and cheese with mushrooms it's pretty awesome. I love that they do protein style."}
{"text":"It was absolutely amazing. The wings are HUGE and cooked just perfect (and they mixed bbq and mild together...so bomb a million thumbs up!) and the pizza was just the way we asked for it. Awesome totally looks like we found our new pizza place!"}
{"text":"Was shocked...where can you go and get a 10\" personal pizza and a drink for $6.50??? I have yet to know a place. Dough has a very fresh taste, as in it tastes natural and not loaded down with \"stuff.\" Great food and very friendly staff and owner. We'll be back for sure! Our group got (2) 26\" pizzas and lots of wings...all well priced! Thanks!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the staff is always very nice. I only wish they were open more hours so I could go more often."}
{"text":"Great place. I went here about 19 years ago when I was working at Grand Canyon University. Hadn't been back in a while but looked them up and had lunch there today. Amazing sandwiches, great pizza, excellent service and really nice people."}
{"text":"Best wings ever! Pizza is huge! My family and I have been ordering from this place for years. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place when looking  for good pizza and wings, specially when the price is right. A small pizza here seems like a medium or large pizza I would normally purchase at a major pizza chain. I've met Jimmie a couple of times and he's awesome. O yes, the brownies is a must try."}
{"text":"For $5(No tax) you can get a MASSIVE sandwich that is easily enough to last two meals(always does for me and I'm a 200lb guy)

They use fresh ingredients, I know this because last time I was there they ran out of turkey and pulled they out a chunk of turkey and started slicing it FRESH!!!

I used to come here all the time when I worked nearby. Now anytime i'm remotely in the area I always pick up a sandwich half because they're so good, half because it's a STEAL.

Only ever had the pizza there once and it was thin and greasy just the way any pizza lover would want.

Tip: GET THE ITALIAN SUB!!! and ask for a side of their Italian sauce on the side, You'll be ADDICTED FOREVER. (I live a good 30min away and have driven there just for one of these monsters)

Another thing to ask for(they always sell out) is the Chicken Parmesan pasta-It's amazing!

Thanks Angie and Jimmy's crew, You guys need to use all the same ingredients and open restaurants across the valley(wouldn't take long to go national!!)"}
{"text":"I love their new location on bell road, hands down this is the best pizza and wings ever. The staff is always friendly and they make a point to know your fist name if you haven't tried it yet this place definitely a place to try."}
{"text":"I've ordered the huge party pizza twice and the party sub once and everything was amazing.  Their service was impeccable.  They delivered on time, brought the food in and we're just very pleasant.  I've wanted to order even more times, but I seem to always want to do so once they're closed."}
{"text":"Met some coworkers for dinner and had their deluxe salad and it was huge! I got three meals out of it, no joke! The guys ordered two orders of fries between 4 men and they didn't finish them. While they did have other things to eat, it just goes to show you how generous their portion sizes are. Everything was very good and customer service is exceptional."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying Angie's and Jimmie's pizza for the 20 years we've lived around the corner from the restaurant. I love their pizza! The crust is perfectly chewy, the sauce is perfect, and the cheese and toppings are in perfect harmony. The restaurant itself is definitely a dive, but I pick up our pizzas and bring them home, so that doesn't matter. The counter staff is friendly and accommodating, as well. I have not yet tried the cannoli, but based on what I've heard here, I will be trying them soon!"}
{"text":"The other reviews are spot on about the parking and neighborhood so I won't repeat all that stuff.  The sign out front just says, \"pizza\" and it looks like something from a bad 80s zombie movie.  The inside looks even more like a bad 80s zombie movie setting.  Maybe it was the lopped off statue heads in the broken claw machine.  We went there on a Saturday night and it was DEAD no pun intended.  They have a couple old school video games in the corner in addition to some random piles of junk and weird stuff.  

They do have Orchata on tap which is pretty cool.  The pizza itself was interesting.  It was a thin crust pizza.  The weird thing was half the pizza had a crunchy cracker like crust and the other half was Brooklyn style soft floppy crust.  Weird.  Definitely really greasy, which I'm not complaining about but it is worth noting.  The price was really cheap.  I think it was $12 for the pizza and $2 for each drink.  With tax and tip it came to $20.  Not bad."}
{"text":"I knew my friends & I would be starving after an evening of stress relief at Shooter's World so I Yelped some restaurants nearby. My friends shot down (pun intended.. har har har) Phx Ranch Market and pho joints off of Camelback so I led them to A&J's for some pizza. We missed the first turn because I was on the look out a sign that said \"Angie & Jimmie's Pizza\", but only saw \"PIZZA\" on the window of a shack. We made a u-ey to get a closer look and thinking the parking lots connected with the porno shop, we pulled in too soon. Lo & behold, the parking lots did not connect so we slinkied into the restaurant, hoping no one passing by would recognize our cars parked at the XXX lot. 

Anyhow, we took a seat in the dining area and cracked jokes about the lame interior-- empty (clean) pizza boxes stacked against the wall, old arcades in the corner and crappy plastic patio furniture.. Even though I don't drink soda, the free soda fountain was a nice option. It even dispenses horchata! 

We ordered a deluxe large pizza, 26 BBQ wings and an order of fries. The pizza was pretty good, but the folded over crust was kind of weird, wings were meaty (albeit a bit too saucy) and the fries were OK-- nicely seasoned w/ spices, but too greasy and not crispy. 

I'd give it 3.5 stars, but rounded up because the service was friendly. $36 pre-tax for 3 people w/ leftovers."}
{"text":"So I've now been in Angie's and Jimmie's Pizza shop twice and so far I'm really liking it overall. There are some off putting things but as far as this neighborhood goes it's pretty great.

Pros:
-The Pizza is delicious. And pretty darn reasonable in price. I always get a personal for $5 and it is quite a big pizza. 
-The cheese is yummy!
-The sauce is just the right kind of semi-sweet.

Cons:
-The older woman who works at the front is quite, well, snippy. She gives off VERY unfriendly vibes and makes you feel like there is something wrong with you for ordering pizza in her store.
-The store is dirty. The kitchen doesn't look dirty but the outer part is really dirty.

I would never eat here as a dine-in but I'll definitely take my food out. It's good as long as you don't get grossed out by the sticky floors. Again, the kitchen DOES NOT look dirty.

All in all, three out of five stars. Clean the place and brighten the attitude of the woman and I'd give it 5! (Everyone else there is really friendly.)"}
{"text":"A and J had the best NY pizza in town that I have found so far. The place is not pretty but the pizza is! Enjoy!"}
