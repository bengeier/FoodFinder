{"text":"Location: St-Sauveur village. There's street parking but only on one side (restaurant).  The place: This actually used to be a house that was converted into a restaurant and thus, the place is very small. I've never had issues getting a table here, but I tend to go at very random hours during the day. I would imagine that a reservation is necessary on weekend evenings. Don't expect anything fancy - the decor is as basic as it gets, but the place is clean.  Service: Great - our waitress was super friendly and chatty.   Food: I always, always go for the Tonkinese soup. ALWAYS. That's how much I love it. The broth is incredibly flavourful and comprised of rice noodles, beef or chicken and Lemongrass. Don't get me started on how much I love Lemongrass. Anyway, this soup is served in a big old bowl and intended to be a meal, so you can easily fill up on this alone and carry about your day, walking and shopping in the area. It's so damn good.  Now, since I stopped by on Good Friday, and the rule on Good Friday is to avoid meat, I made a bold move - I chose the crispy noodles with shrimp. We won't talk about how I inadvertently stared down the guy at the next table, who was clearly enjoying MY soup. Anyway, the noodles were OK; since the veggies and five shrimp (yes, I counted) didn't evenly cover the noodles, there was a section of the plate where they remained crispy. The veggies were crunchy and tasty and I really couldn't say with any accuracy whether or not they were frozen. The shrimp were good but tasted a bit watery - they were properly cooked and served with the tail on. Overall, I enjoyed the dish but it wasn't the best I've had. Still, very decent. One thing to point out - I am very sensitive to stuff like MSG. Judging by how good I felt when I left the place, I'm going to say they don't use any but if they do, it's minimal. Don't quote me on this because I forgot to ask them. Eat at your own risk.  I got the lunch special which included, soup (a mini Tonkinese minus the meat! YAY!), a main and a pot of Jasmine tea. The whole thing cost me $13 +tax. Note that they may not offer lunch deals on weekends. The trend around these parts is to increase prices on weekends."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! What a wonderful restaurant! I love trying out different Thai restaurants and see how they differ. Wow! I was absolutely surprised by the fantastic flavor in the Tom Yum and Pad Thai I had the other night. I will DEFINITELY be going back.   Also to note, is that the customer services was great. The young lady who was serving all the guests was very helpful. My friend and I got there in the evening so they must have only had one server, but she was helpful, patient, and spoke very good english (for someone who knows little French). I would say, in Saint-Sauveur, this is a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant à St-Sauveur.  Je recommande le \"pad thaï\" (pas disponible le midi mais si vous demandez, on peut sûrement vous accommoder)...  Sinon, dans le menu du soir, le sauté grésillant au basilic est vraiment excellent.  Sinon, le sauté à la citronnelle est bien goûteux.    Vous ne vous tromperez pas à cet endroit."}
{"text":"Très bonne nourriture et personnel courtois. J'ai pris le plat à la sauce aux arachides en take out. Petit conseil, demandez leur de mettre les épinards croustillants dans un autre plat si vous voulez qu'ils soit...croustillants. Les miens étaient par dessus le repas et tout détrempés par la sauce. D'ailleurs, ce plat est plus petit que la plupart des autres plats, vous pouvez rester sur votre appétit. Pour la qualité des légumes et de la cuisson, rien a dire, très bon.  Le sauté au noix de cajou est excellent et la portion très bonne. Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"We arrived at opening time, 11:30 AM, so did the owners/cooks. It did not start well. As Coach Lombardi (Green Bay Packers) said \"If you're on time, you're actually 15 minutes late\", and he hated people and vendors to be late. So anyway, here we are ordering the Pho soup with chicken, which was described as the \"large soup\" on the menu.   Forty-five minutes, after all other patrons had received their meals, my soup arrived. What a disappointment! It came in a bowl no larger than my coffee latte with 5 thin slices of tasteless breast chicken. The broth was good though. That's why I give one star. But there was no bean sprouts, lemongrass herbs or even lime.   When I asked the waiter about the small size of my bowl, she retorqued that if I was not happy with it, I should have ordered the \"extra large\" soup. Except this item was not on the menu. And besides, when I order soup at my favorite Pho restaurants in Ft Lauderdale, I always get the standard soup in what this place calls the \"extra large\" soup bowl.  Sorry, but I won't come back there."}
