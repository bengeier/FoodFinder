{"text":"First time trying Kogo since it has changed from Ichiban. I am glad I tried so now that I know never to come here again. 

They only had one waitress working with a lady who seemed like the owner during dinner peak hours. The service was exceptionally slow. The side plates we received were dirty... when we asked to get new clean plates the owner simply took the plates without making any acknowledgement and gave us new plates, to our surprise, were dirty! Poor hygiene topped with poor customer service is what describes this restaurant.

Now moving on to food. The price is not too bad considering other sushi dine in restaurants. But when we tasted the food, this is more like food court takeout quality. We ordered maki and sushi platter and some sushi pieces smelled funky (tuna and white sushi). Overall, their food is edible but definitely not a dine in restaurant quality. I would not recommend this restaurant for its poor hygiene, poor customer service, and below average food quality. There are plenty of sushi restaurants nearby and Kogo quite didn't make the cut."}
{"text":"Very average. 

It's a big space, but for some reason there's only one or two waitresses. Not every table has the call button either, which means super slow service.

I found the menu badly designed in terms of sushi combos--the smallest 1 person combo has 24 pieces and costs $26. I ended up getting that combo (between two people) with an appetizer that was quite filling for two. I suggest smaller 16-18 pieces combos. I thought of combining appetizer and rolls but it'd end up pricy and not filling as regular rolls are only 6 pieces.

Korean food (last page) is really overpriced with bulgogi costing around $16.

The food itself was decent: typical fish grade, fresh and rolls were well done. 

Almost forgot to mention, they don't bring the bill so you have to pay upfront.

If they re-design their menu, I'd consider coming back (on days when the weather is bad and you want to stay inside the mall), but otherwise it's not really worth it with better choices around."}
{"text":"restaurants are run by humans and sometimes can run into mistakes...

Having said that I decided to update my because the owner sincerely contacted me and apologized for my experience (which to me is a good thing as it shows he does care).

My review was poor because of the quality of food we received.

Our tofu was sour, unagi sushi old and flimsy.

Service at the time was really bad (not rude, just they weren't around much and delivery of food was slow)."}
{"text":"We had AYCE sushi - for $27 per person. Honestly DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE!!! this place is by far the worst ayce places that I've ever tried before. 

First off - the food was very VERY POOR QUALITY. We order the appetizers tofu....the tofu was sour. It's a sign that they're giving us old food that they need to get rid of. The eel sushi wasn't fresh at all. Very poor quality of sashimi.
The Korean food were ok but after the sour tofu we were hesitant to order anything with tofu in it.

Slow and poor service - they kept messing up our order. Or even had to ask us \"did we order this?\" - automatic shake my head in disapproval.

Best advice - stay away from this restaurant if you don't want to get sick the next day and be stuck on the toilet"}

{"text":"This place is horrible, i dont know why they waste everyones time. 
Food is disgusting. I had to wait 40 mins for just one bento box togo."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim. This corner at Empress walkway always has been a Japanese restaurant but I can't remember if it's always been the same owners


It is a very spacious restaurant. Service was quick but otherwise unremarkable .

We order the sushi boat which was meant for two people however when It came we were very surprised by how much there were on the boat. What is great is that there are actually quite a lot of varieties of fish on the boat. I especially love the torched sashimi, giving the raw fish some depth of flavour. 

Luckily we did not order anything else other than the sushi boat. I think we spent at least two hours here slowly eating and chatting away. It was actually a good meal, when you're not in a hurry and take your time to enjoy each piece. We actually finish the boat and you were not overly full yet still satisfied.

Parking is in the basement however you do need to pay unless you plan to shop and Loblaw's therefore this is not a place I will return to unless I happen to be nearby. It's a good restaurant though"}
{"text":"You can find delicious Sushi here with friendly staff, don't miss this place. I order sunset Sushi which is little crispy and yummy."}
{"text":"Came here looking for Ichiban and got an experience I was not expecting. The food here just isn't good. We got a platter for two, so I could sample a lot of maki and negiri. 

The tempura bits and tempura shrimp were not fresh. Clearly made hours ago. The eel was really fatty and gross. The salmon negiri was ok, but the other negiri did not taste clean. 

The dynamite rolls and California rolls were huge, falling apart, and tasted really fishy. There was another maki roll with a lot of raw fish on top, but it was just a glorified California roll. The sushi was oddly sweet. Weak wasabi too. 

Sadly, this restaurant's predecessor gave it big shoes to fill and it's failing. 

My golden rule (don't dine in sushi restaurants that offer all you can eat) stands true."}
{"text":"The sushi here is pretty decent; but that doesn't reflect at all on the service.

When you first walk in you'll be greeted by an older Korean lady, who I can only assume is the manager, who has among the absolute worst temperament I've ever come across in the food industry. 

Do you have any questions regarding the menu? Get ready to get condescending answers that will make you feel like a fool for asking.

After getting mentally abused by the front desk, you'll be escorted to 1 of 2 locations in the restaurant.

1. You'll be seated right in the middle of the restaurant near the sushi making counter where you'll receive below average service every 10 minutes or so.

2. You'll be seated anywhere that's not the middle, including the areas near the windows or the washroom - where you'll receive 0 attention for at least an hour unless you ring the service bell like some door-to-door child prankster. Even then it's a hit or miss.

Once the orders are placed, you'll get food at a decent time depending on how busy the day is. As in if there are at least 5 tables occupied of the 12 or so, you'll probably be waiting for a bit.

Although there's one waitress, her name is Sunny, and she's pretty nice and sweet. Make sure not to mention this to the Sushi Queen, because the only response you'll get is \"Okay, whatever.\"

Overall if you want \"Okay, whatever' sushi, I'd only recommend this place if you go for takeout and there's absolutely no other option (which there are all over the area)."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for a long time. When they were called Ichiban my whole family would come here. I love their lunch sashimi and tempura bento. The presentation is gorgeous with some wakame and flying fish roe beside the sashimi. Food is normally good however service is not. 
The current owners do not have enough service staff present to manage the front desk or the tables. I do like the ringers they have on the table to get the attention of the service staff but during lunch time it takes a while to get the check. It's faster to go to the front to pay. 
Today I ordered take out. The manager (I also believe is the owner) took the order and said to come back 15-20 minutes. We did as we went to Loblaws and LCBO to pick up a few things. We went back 20 minutes later and when I presented her the bill she was going to charge me again. I told her we had already paid and she said it's not ready yet. We waited for another 20 minutes and at this time my friend was starving and wanted to know what was going on. Finally at 45 minutes from when we first ordered we received our food of spicy beef tofu and cod fish tofu (Korean dishes). On the take out menu it said it came with rice and salad. We were already out of the restaurant when I noticed the salad wasn't there. I called right away and the manager said it doesn't come with take out but dine in only. I said it showed on the take out menu that it does. She said she would do it for me this time. I went to pick it up. She put both salads into one container as I said we had two orders. She said she combined it (it looked like one portion to me and I didn't argue as I go there often). So I go back home to open up the rest of the food only to discover the spicy beef tofu was 1/3 filled (round soup bowl) while the cod fish one was filled to the brim. I called them again and told them how it wasn't filled (also the egg in there was still raw which meant the soup was lukewarm). The first person I spoke to said that's how it was...it wasn't supposed to fill the take out bowl. I was shocked as I took a picture with the chopsticks dipped into the bowl so you can see how much was in there. She asked if I wanted to speak to the manager and I did. I asked the manager if she remembers me and how I go to her restaurant quite often and she acknowledged that. I told her my friend paid for the meal and said he will never go there again (we went to Crazy Don last night for the spicy seafood tofu - it was excellent there) and wanted a refund. She offered to make a new batch. I went to pick it up and this one was a little more than the last one. 
Today's lesson has taught me not to order the take out Korean dishes at KOGO and go for the bento boxes (I've always been pleased with them). Korean take out will be at Crazy Don's but if you eat in the restaurant they give you the kimchi appetizers.
The picture below with one bowl is the one I got afterwards"}
{"text":"Taste and the quality of food were awful and slow service didn't care customers that much.  And one of male server yelling at another server maybe joking but it was so annoying in front of customers. After 40mins I got stomach ache as well. What a day !!! This is awful"}
{"text":"This location used to be an Ichiban Sushi which closed down. Kogo sushi has taken its place. We came for a late lunch, early dinner & it wasn't busy. But there was a good amount of people here for a Sunday afternoon. The waitress we got was nice, friendly & efficient. 

Hubby was disappointed though that he couldn't get the Asian nachos because they \"ran out of ingredients\". We shared the kalbi appetizer, gyoza & spring rolls. I ordered the Boston roll & lobster roll. All of the food was good. I actually couldn't finish all my rolls because they were so big. I almost couldn't fit them in my mouth. Due to the size of the rolls I think they are justified in pricing them a little higher than other sushi restaurants. I would come here to eat again. 

As for the decor it's mostly the same as before but they did refresh it & it looks good."}
{"text":"Horrible service (by the hostess, major attitude from her, guess she's not happy with life?) and the donburi I ordered was the worst I've ever had in my life - seemed like a pre-packaged meal that you would pick up in a Korean supermarket.  Don't know how this place stays in business, such huge retail space and always seems empty!"}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews before walking into this restaurant. 
I used to come here when it was Ichiban, and it was always pleasant. 
Me and my hubby wanted to go to Wako but due to weather, we decided to stay close and come here. 

Service was actually good. They had the bell to call them, so we received attention when we needed which was not an issue at all. 

Issues arised with food. VERY LOW QUALITY FOOD here. 
We got Spicy Salmon Roll, Softshell Crab and Katsu Don. 
We thought we received wrong order as Softshell Crab Roll didn't look right. The roll was humongous filled with mostly rice, tiny pieces of crab was super fishy. (I think it was not fresh) It should be crispy as deep fried, but was soggy. Super gross. 

Katsu Don also had its own issues. 
We found 2 pieces of short black hair, that seems to belong to someone in the kitchen. The pork had rubbery texture that made me question what kind of meat it is. Or if it's even a real meat. The katsu itself was very soggy due to sauce overload. 

Only thing that seemed edible was the Spicy Salmon Roll. This actually had crispy fried pieces on top which was a pinkish colour. I wanted to believe that they intentionally put food colouring for the presentation. 

All in all, I would give 1 star for the service as they came immediately after bell is pressed. :)

Never to be back here again, and I wouldn't recommend any of my friends and family to come here either. 
Easily the worst Japanese restaurant I've been to."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in nice location, lots of space, but it is waste of space. The food is horrible, worse than ichiban(where it used be). I ordered the oyako don (chicken with egg on rice).i was shocked when I saw it. It was just tiny, the chicken was the frozen dry burned supermarket ones tasted like the leftover for at least a week. The dish was semi warm, no eggs laying on top of the chicken, there was a runny egg on the side looked like they put in hot water for one min and took it out to put it there. Sometimes I know when the food taste bad, they at least look ok, but this place just doesn't care. The only thing I could eat was the tiny bit of semi warm rice. This got to be the worst meal I have ever had in years. Price was not cheap, for 13+tax and tips!! I just left and went to crazy don instead."}
