{"text":"Decent food just tried the steak sub not really impressed typical private owned restaurant ran by teenagers. Probably won't come back. Happy yelping people!!!"}
{"text":"Unorganized, no leadership and everyone is running around looking for all different orders. One guy next to me waited two hours for his order."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed!  Got the buffalo chicken grinder, and those were the two things it lacked.  Barely any chicken, and hardly any buffalo sauce.  If I wouldn't have added my own ranch the sub would of been really dry."}
{"text":"Ordered an Italian grinder...waited 30minutes when there were only 3 tables occupied. Finally went up to the counter and they realized they had forgotten to make it. Brought it out and only offered free chips . The rest of our party took a long time to get their food as well. No clean utensils they had to give us plastic ones. There were 2 tables that were not bussed when we came in and the same when we left an hour and a half later."}
{"text":"Awesome subs, decent salads and delicious pizzas. They've been consistent and friendly. We just moved to the area, and it's our go to place for a quick meal. Wish they delivered"}
{"text":"A pretty good pizza and sub shop located in the Harris Teeter plaza at Stevens Mill and Lawyers Road. Good pizza and subs. They do make a fantastic salad. Grilled chicken on greek salad is great. Huge portion and lots of fresh ingredients. They are very convenient, you can call ahead and pick up and take out or eat in. While it's not full waiter service, they do bring your food to your table after ordering. They also have a patio to sit at as well which is a nice feature in the spring and fall when it's not too hot."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza and Grinders There Cheese has so much taste not like others. A bunch of real nice guys.... I keep on going back for more"}
{"text":"This is a great grinder place, just down the road from The Divide golf course and driving range. Pizza and Chicago grinders were delicious, on house-made white bread - so good I want to come back for some to take home! This will definitely be a do-over the next time we're in this area. Next time we'll try the pizza."}
{"text":"First time here.  Good menu selection.  Really good Italian Grinders.  Comfy atmosphere..self serve soda fountain so you can drink away!   Going to try the pizza next time!!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza joint.  Have subs & other options also.  Solid but not fantastic pizza.  Have plenty of room to eat-in so they have that over Dominos or Papa Johns.  Little pricier than your other chain pizza joints & not as good pie as your mom & pop NY pizza places, so kind of stuck in the middle of your pizza market."}
{"text":"I stopped by on my way home from Charlotte yesterday and picked up a pizza with sausage, bacon, and pepperoni.  Wow!!  It actually had real ingredients.  So much so that I am having leftovers today and it's so delicious I had to go online and give them 5 Stars before I forgot.  I was a fan Pizza Hut for years, but now it tastes fake like the rest.  Bellacino's it is for me from now on!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in many years. But, I got talked in to going for dinner.  It has changed for the better.  The sub was good, and so was the pizza.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been here a million times, my in-laws live in the neighborhood so this is a frequent lunch stop for us where they have enough variety everyone can find something they want.  Pizzas are OK decent flavor, I like the thin crust, and toppings taste fresh.  Sandwiches are very good, pizza crust bread baked in house, they load ya up on the toppings and the \"half\" sandwich is huge, I always only eat half of mine and have leftovers!  Favorite sandwich has to be the meatball.  Unlike any I've had before, they slice the meat into thin layers and give ya a good inch of meat across the board topped with sauce and melt cheese on top of the crust/bread.... ohhh so good.  I will say though don't plan on coming and being awed by anything in perticular, its a good spot, not a great spot, good food, not awesome food."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have the best garlic cheese bread, and everything is priced low. I would stick to subs and pizzas though. Their pasta dishes are lousy. The Alfredo tastes like fake cheese sauce."}
{"text":"This pizza place is shocking good and hidden away in Stallings NC no less! I love the BBQ chicken pizza and Chicken alfredo - my husband likes the Chicago Steak pizza and the Belliconos Pride....the grinders are delish as well.... I order the turkey! We eat here at least once a week for the last 9 months and service has always been great"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. I've visited six times. Three of those visits ended up with my order being made incorrectly or missing something. This time my pizza was made incorrectly and when I pointed out the error, I was asked if I couldn't just eat it the way it was. While the food is good when made properly, this will be my last visit.   Make sure your take-out order is correct before you leave and don't expect them to remake entire order over. The rest of my order is now cold while I had to wait for them to remake the pizza."}
{"text":"It has been ages since we went to Bellacino's, and that was clear on the other side of Charlotte. So when we came across this location, just down the street from us out here in the sticks, it was a pleasant surprise. Sure they are a chain, but they make decent subs, and their pizzas are not bad either. In fact, most of their food is really tasty. A bit on the salty side, but tasty.  The menu is in fact where it is at when you go to Bellacino's.  Like many places, deciding what sounds best may be the best part of the meal, and it is no exception here. The bad news is that it gets progressively worse. Staff at this location sometimes just does not seem to care much for anything, and cleanliness is really not high on their list. Our condiments were covered in sauce of some sort - and not fresh sauce, but stuff that would take Violet Beauregard to chew off the tops of the shakers. Luckily we were able to switch it to another table before anyone noticed. The advantage of having a less-than-clean establishment is that it is not all that full. Ever. More than once we have been the only people in the joint.  When our food eventually came out, it came in spurts.  Uh, you know what I mean.  First a pizza. Then two sandwiches. Finally the other pizza, just as the first person was finishing up. I have worked in restaurants, and I get that it is hard to get things out exactly at the same time, but seriously? Does it really have to take that long? And to make matters worse, the last pizza was so piping hot that it just could not be eaten. Had the first pizza been the hot one, at least the waiting would have made things seem better, you know?  The motto here is \"baked, not toasted\". It is indeed baked - but they need a larger oven or something, because the tiny oven gets things so freaking hot you can't eat them - and they come out one at a time. In fact, we've even had apps come out after the entree. But it is a decent meal, all in all."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas this side of Brooklyn. Oh and don't forget the grinders that are ALL fantastic and smoasted. Yea they call it smoasted not toasted. Not a quick in and out place but the quality and consistency is always on point."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went into this place at 9:30 pm (they close at 10) which made me A little nervous since I knew that they would want to clean and close up. We placed our order and got it to go. Sandwiches were on point, full of taste which for a sandwich made that close to closing says a lot of a place! Definitely give this one a whirl! Zesty Italian with olive oil and vinegar in place of pasta sauce is the way to go :)"}
{"text":"sorry...no fresh dough...itastes like it came out of a frozen box....i can make better at home."}
{"text":"Subs are good, pizza sauce has a little kick to it. The place seems to be run primarily by teenagers but they do a good job of keeping things running.  Good local place but not worth driving across town for it."}
