{"text":"Great service. Food was terrific! I had the halibut a chips. Btw organic fish that is not square!! and you can get grilled if you want. It was $16.99. Son had shrimp and chips, about 6 battered shrimp $15.99 with excellent dipping sauce. My son also had homemade ice cream. Omg!! Soooo good.  Little pricy for a lunch but very good and high quality. Batter was also nice and thin and not greasy!!  I'm in love. Only thing I would do different is maybe some lunch specials, and NO styrofoam containers for left overs. They are all about organic etc. just doesn't seem right. I'd rather have mine wrapped in newspaper to take home.  Keep up the great job!!"}
{"text":"Alright, this place is awesome. First of all, our waitress was on fire. She was an absolute gem. I believe we all forgot to ask her name, but all the staff seemed to be really friendly.   First impression: this décor was fresh, charming and cozy. There were little details all over reminding everyone of the British influence. It was a really calming experience.  I went for broke and got the pollock and chips. I enjoy fish, but I figured when it was battered and fried, any white fish would do. Boy was I naïve. While the pollock was fresh, I am sure the flavour would have been more enjoyable had I chose the haddock or halibut. Both dishes are still really affordable, so I recommend not being as frugal as I was!!  The batter was SO deliciously crispy, just the right thickness and not too heavy. And the fish was still moist and flaky inside. It was a skill that I had not had not yes experienced at any other restaurant. The portions were huge, I could only eat one filet and brought the other home. I actually measured when I got home, and the filet was 10\" long!!! The fries.. well I would have liked longer fries for finger usage, but these short, fat ones were still really good. They re-heat really well which is a bonus for these huge portions!  Now - lets talk coleslaw. I love coleslaw. If it's a side, I'm there. This one was good, but I'm a vinegar and oil gal, and this creamy was just not converting me in any way. Still flavourful, but I would LOVE if there was an option of the two.    Anyway, I will be back. I want to try the po'boy, the calamari, fried shrimp... pretty much any and all of the things in my mouth. This place will do well in Newmarket!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here but won't be my last. One word folks... Delicious!!!! Ok a few more words. The service is great. Portions are large. Restaurant looks great! Everything from the tartar sauce to the fries are all very tasty. I will be bringing my east coast mother the next time I come to get her opinion"}
{"text":"Great food - local and fresh! The posh fries with Parmesan and white truffle oil are to die for!!! I also had the smelts - which I hadn't had in years - and they were fantastic. Owner and staff are very enthusiastic and the service was great whether for pick up or eating in. A welcome addition to Main Street!"}
{"text":"Awesome fish and chips! The onions rings with the spicy dip gave it an extra kick. I could have eaten an endless amount of them. Service was great! Everyone was super attentive. Dessert was great. Deep fried Mars bar... What more needs to be said. Also, they have homemade pumpkin pie ice cream for the season which was also delicious. Will visit again when back in Canada."}
{"text":"Excellent spot to get your fish and chips.  Fish batter is on the safe side could use a touch more seasoning, but fish was fried to perfection more than made up for it.   Chips are simply perfect."}
{"text":"First time today at Chip and Malt!! Great experience! Portions were huge fish was delicious and batter was perfect texture! Our server was awesome! Cold-slaw could have been better and the fries a little more crispy but all in all another great addition to Main St. I will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing homemade desserts. They also did a nice job with the design and decor, definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Had chip malt take out today best fish and chips I've had!! The biggest piece of halibut by far I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Absolutely everything you expect out of a fish and chips establishment. Couldn't have asked for more! The portions are huge so watch out. This is well deserved 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Have Mercy! We were more than pleasantly surprised by this place ~ The haddock is fresh and light, never mind that it's deep fried.  Crispy batter on flaky fish - impressive portions - great atmosphere... Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"As usual this place is amazing. Went on Mother's Day weekend. Fast and efficient service, food was amazing (as always!). The owner Chris always remembers his customers and makes time to chat. Thank you again for the great meal and we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Good food and lots of options, I recommend going to this place. The service was pretty good, but from the street the lighting is poor and you can never really tell if it's open.   Takes me back to the sea side in England.  4/5*"}
{"text":"Friends had suggested we try it. Boy am I glad we did. Right from the get go, we were received by Chris who was very friendly and treated as if we were special.  Tracey our server was prompt and pleasant. We ordered drinks and they came out quickly. Chris came back and explained the menu and the weekly specials.  Tracey came back and we ordered the fish and chips halibut and haddock. We were not disappointed food was fresh and gigantic portions. In fact we took half home. We would highly recommend this restaurant and can't wait to come back and try their extensive menu Jim and Naomi Newmarket"}
{"text":"Finally, good fish and chips for the Newmarket area! The service is so friendly :) the kind of friendly you rarely see anymore, and the foods all made from scratch (you can really taste it). The portions are also massive, and taste super fresh. Outstanding experience! I will be back for sure! Also, it has a great vibe and unique food, awesome place for date night!"}
{"text":"Really Really Good, fish was fresh and plentiful, chips superb. Tasty Coleslaw and tartar.  Cold drinks , nice digs . Prices are fair , quantity is not an issue. Quality is spot on. Next time i'll go to the grilled fish. Had to try the traditional it was awesome but maybe twice a year."}
{"text":"Sooooooo yummy! Was there Saturday night with my parents and two nieces. Thank you Chris for welcoming us and thank you Lindsay, our server, for being so lovely.  The food was awesome - haddock and chips, shrimp po-boy, and two yankee burgers, one sans bun.  I can't wait to go back.  Thank you Chip+Malt.    :)"}
{"text":"Halibut and fries was delicious.  Served piping hot. Even my last bite was still hot. Huge portion. Great service."}
{"text":"What are chips and malt anyway? Oooooh I get it, this name is meant to attract visitors and nostalgic folks from \"across the pond\". Jolly Good, but you better get your purses out because this fish & chip joint ain't cheap. For 17 bucks you get a pretty decent hunk of Halibut sitting on about 2lbs of fries (which you'll never be able to consume.....I tried, to get the most value for my dollars), a skimpy serving of cole slaw and a wedge of lemon. All this is contained in a nice blue thick cardboard box. Whew....that must cost a pretty penny alone! I always heard that the Brits liked their fish 'n chips wrapped in newspaper! Times are a-changing, I guess, as well as times that this eatery is open for business. Don't try to get your fish 'n chip fix on a Sunday or Monday as you will walk away disappointed by the sign on the door which reads \"Gone Fishing\".     The Halibut is pretty good tho' and I would return just for that. I also really liked the absence of grease that usually drips from fish and chip takeout bags. Hmmm now I see the reason for the thick cardboard boxes.....pretty clever, I must say.  But this place is overrated, I must also add."}
{"text":"Worth the wait. Our favourite meal of the summer - halibut and chips/fried chicken sandwich! Service was fast and friendly, menu has many things to come back for, have dessert, they make their own ice cream.   Great addition to the neighbourhood, if only it was set up to watch premiership games with brunch."}
{"text":"First time eating here, I really enjoyed the way the fish was prepared, crispy on the outside and flaky and tender inside. It tasted fresh and the fries were good too. I would definitely return here."}
{"text":"Great fish and amazing chips (fries). It has become our go-to for fish & chips take out. Friendly staff, and reasonable prices mean we will come back again and again.  Tip: if planning on going for good Friday... Call way ahead or plan to wait in line."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and nice portions. Half our guests (two) loved their fish and chips. My cod couldn't be cut with a fork due to a piece of either skin or membrane on the dark  meat side of the fillet. The chips were mixed sizes from tiny crispy pieces (over cooked) to nice large pieces done to perfection.  Dipped in their delicious gravy solved the over cooked problem. My wife's Halibut however tasted fishy and we order her Halibut because it's usually never fishy. We were not sure if it was simply a Tuesday after a long weekend (using Saturday's fish) but at least half out fish wasn't up to quality we expected to get based on what most of the reviewers here have said. We would go back again because half our group thought it was the best fish they had in a long time and maybe it was just a fluke (excuse the pun) we got some poorer quality fish"}
{"text":"What a small town gem!  The fish and chips are crispy and delicious, however the Greek salad is what keeps me coming back!  Also, I highly recommend sharing the chips and curds (poutine) with a friend, the portion is substantial and the taste is delightful."}
{"text":"Yes - I had a burger at a fish and chip place. It came highly recommended and didn't disappoint. Big portions of food, friendly staff.. I'll be going back again, to try the fish. Try the deep fried mars bar!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST fish and chips on this side of the pond. Everything is made from scratch, and its evident with every bite you take that these guys put love and care into their product. They even make their own ice cream, and they keep coming up with new flavours. I eat here at least once a week. Last time I went, I tried the Tika Masala... amazing! Wow. I highly recommend it. Oh, they also have Innis and Gun on tap. What more could you ask for? From the crispy batter, to the thick cut chips, the in house made coleslaw, and the attentive servers, this place is my new favourite in Newmarket. Keep up the great work mates!"}
{"text":"Fish and chips came in a huge portion. Nothing was greasy and tasted unbelievable. Also tried the chowder, to die for. Bread pudding was equally as amazing as everything else. The decor of the restaurant was really cool, and the staff were incredibly friendly. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Fish and Chip shop, their fish is cooked to a perfect tenderness while their batter seems to magically be free of the oily-sog so common among its competitors - will it be crisp?  Without a doubt, but it remains crispy after it has cooled off a bit - I've heard it's due to the kind of batter they use, I'm not convinced it isn't magic.  I haven't tried anything else on the menu, but the fish and chips is increadible."}
{"text":"I'd been waiting for this place to open for over a year. \"Keep calm. Fish & Chips are coming\" was on the sign for a while. I found out that the lovely, old building in which they're located needed some extra TLC to make it serviceable for dining. The wait was worth it. It's always, always busy when I go. Make a reservation to get ahead of the line.  The menu is simple -- one sheet -- and the main draw is all listed at the top. Cod, Hallibut, Haddock, etc. The one thing that's unique about this place that I've never seen in another fish & chips restaurant is the option to get the fish grilled instead of battered & fried. The grilled fish is spiced just so and it's nice and firm and held together. (Whenever I try to make fish, it falls apart! I don't know how they do it!) The tartar sauce is made in house, and it's another great reason to try this place.  The atmosphere is everything you could hope for with a British-style fish & chips joint. The booths are clean, the tables spacious. It's a bit of a challenge for a group larger than 4 to find seating during rush hour, so call ahead and get advice if you have a large group.  If the prospect of great grilled fish isn't enough to entice you, then maybe the next four words will: Deep Fried Mars Bars.  Deep. Fried. Mars. Bars.  It is like eating a warm s'mores with ice cream. You need this in your life."}
{"text":"And now, some 5 star poetry, brought to you by your friend Kris U from Yelp GTA... ahem  Oh, Hot damn Chip+Malt is my jam Kept my tummy full Until the AY AM  You all don't understand (Their fish) Is delish when it comes fresh from the  Fry-ayer, ay, ayer, ayer, ay, Fry-ayer  This has been 5 star poetry, brought to you by Kris U from Yelp GTA.  Months of drooling on my keyboard finally came to an end today as I took down the Moby Dick of my food journey! Had to drive 50 minutes north to reach but I set sail with plenty of time and prayed to the gods for a smooth journey.  Empty on arrival, got a chance to chat with the server (I believe her name was Heather?) Who was basically my most favourite server EVER. So sweet, so helpful, so friendly. This hipster-ish looking place has seemingly managed to maintain small town charm with big city flavours all under one roof.  I went all out today and had the Halibut and Chips. Easily top2 Hali-Chips combo I've ever had. 5oz Triangular piece perfectly coated in a perfect layer of perfect batter, perfectly cooked with no crumble or flaking on the outside - just like god intended it to be. Chips were equally nice, I asked for well done and the stood up against the bath of salt and malt vinegar I gave them. Paired with a noticibly fresh coleslaw and easily one of the best pints of Guinness I've had poured outside of Ireland (no metallic taste, just smooth and almost sweet), and I was doing good.  ...or so I thought  Before long, I was finished, not full, but comfortable and my server came by to temp me with dessert. Normally I'm against sweets during the week but she sold it so well I forget about everything I just ate and next thing I knew, there sat a UK Mars Bar (The chocolate is better in the UK version apparently) deep-fried in funnel cake batter and server with vanilla bean ice cream made in house. Yikes.  I'm going to stop there becuase if you're reading this right now, you're probably getting as hungry as I am while writing this, and this time of night they are closed sooo until next time  Eatcrest Out!  PS - PRO TIP: Apparently their Orange Ruffie sells out daily. So Call ahead to  score a piece - it's that good. I shall return"}
{"text":"I don't know what I like more about this place, the food or the service. Let's start with the service: super friendly staff, who make you smile. Now, the food. I highly recommend the Lamb Burger, and the Orange Roughie Fish. I ordered both one time, because I couldn't decide between the two, and they're both SO good. The fries are nothing to write home about, but with some gravy on the side, can be quite the complement. The desserts are also drool worthy, they have icecreams that are homemade in-house, so it's a good way to end the meal!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to revisit!! Very warming and friendly service. Staff greeted us welcomely. Our seats were close to the door and drafty when being opened. The waitress offered to change our seats right away. In terms of the food, we had French onion soups and it was very very good; not too salty or concentrated, and the cheese and bread proportions are just right. I ordered the orange roughy fish and chips and husband ordered the halibut fish and chips. Both were crispy delicious and cooked tenderly moist and fresh. Hail to the coleslaw. I love love love it's not overly sour or dressed. Just tasted perfect for me. We had the innis gunn beer of course and it was perfect pairing for our food. Dessert we tried the regular vanilla ice cream and the Guinness ice cream. I prefer the Guinness one As it was less sweet and taste was fabulous. Love this place. More food items on the waiting list for my next visits!!"}
{"text":"A solid Friday lunch treat, or dinner since their portions are generous and quite large.  I ordered the halibut and chips, with tartar sauce and coleslaw. For dessert, their bread pudding made from Lindt chocolate with toffee drizzle.  Both were plentiful and delicious. They gave me too many fries so I had to pack that up.  I thought the service was very friendly and all the staff were welcoming, always saying Thank You and giving us warm smiles. I would go back if in the area since they had other things on the menu that I was interested in trying which is great if you're not really craving solely fish n chips. Great place, would recommend."}
{"text":"We decided to have a mini reunion at my cousins in New Market. She suggested we go to this restaurant and boy were we glad we went. The restaurant has an old English vibe. There are booths that we chose to eat in and the food was out of this world good. Everything was amazing but the Sampler was melt in your mouth great. A bit expensive but definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"Fanominal fish and chips. Very healthy portions and you will be full afterwards. Great price too. Only issues is it may get a little full if you just walk in during dinner hours."}
{"text":"Had lunch here after reading Yelp review.  Service was friendly and courteous and food was great.  I had the halibut and chips which I would recommend.  The batter is light and crispy, not oily like you find in most fish and chips restaurants.  The fish was excellent and the chips were great and the portion size was big. Not sure if it was just a coincidence but Phil Collins playing in the restaurant completed the authentic English feel :)  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is now my fave fish and chip place. Everything looks and tastes amazing. The restaurant is very nice and clean. Staff are amazing also.  I had a haddock with greek salad. The vegetables were all so fresh. The fish was so big, that I had to take half of it home. It was a very good experience. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best fish n chips places I have been to. Excellent location right on main street, the service was great and family owned (heather was awesome!), and the food even better. Huge portions which will definitely fill you up and has many fish selection. Recommend the orange roughy!"}
{"text":"Our table ordered the:  - This & That Sampler, it came with battered fish (of your choice), fried shrimps, calamari, coleslaw and fries. The calamari was delicious and the breading was light. The fish (halibut) and shrimps were also good, but I didn't like either enough to want to order them again.   - Poutine - I would pass on this because it is your standard poutine. The fries were really good (we asked for them to be cooked well done)  - Aged cheddar burger - The patty was fresh and crumbly. The house made sauce (which reminded me of big mac sauce) was so tasty.   - Mushy Peas - Bland, I added a generous amount of salt and bp to it.   - Bread and Butter Pudding - Crunchy on the top, gooey on the inside (with chocolate and no raisins). This dessert was yummy but next time I'd rather reserve my stomach space for the sticky toffee pudding.  - Eggnog Icecream - Firm, creamy, heavenly, delicious.  - Guinness Icecream - I wanted to like this more than I did. The beer flavour is prominent (which I enjoyed) but the texture was unusually icey/watery/crunchy."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant on Main Street serving fish and chips. They also have burgers, salads, chicken sandwiches as well - something for those who don't want fish.  The food is decent nothing to rave about and it is a little bit more pricier than other joints in Newmarket.   The fish portions are great - I had the haddock for $13.99 with fries, salad is 2.99 extra. There give a lot of fries so I recommend sharing the fries and just ordering another piece of fish.  A plus is the fact that our server was a really nice lady, attentive and had a lot of knowledge about the different types of fish."}
{"text":"Have visited this location twice now and the food and service have been amazing!  I've had the Yankee burger and the Halibut fish and chips during the few visits and the quality of food that was served was great. Just to note, the portions are huge (I would probably share with another person next time I visit). Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 6 no reservations, we were seated fairly quickly. We chose to cram into a booth, they gave us a couple options. Meal came quickly, halibut and chips x6. Every piece of fish was a good size, meaty, perfect amount of breading. Service was very friendly. We got bread pudding for dessert, was yummy, my grandmother loved it. They all seem to be very proud of what they do and they should be.  Quality place. Definitely would return and recommend it."}
{"text":"Came back after a positive experience a few months prior to this visit, and luckily nothing seems to have changed. Visited for lunch on a Friday around 1:00 pm. There is plenty of parking on side streets and lots off to Main St Newmarket. The restaurant was around half full at the time and we were told to sit wherever. Me and a coworker were a bit hungry so we had already decided on the orders beforehand. Got the halibut and chips while my coworker got the This and That sampler. Our server had informed us that the portion for the sampler would be quite large, and she was definitely right on that one. There was around 12 pieces of calamari, 3 shrimps, a big portion of cod, and not to mention a serving of fries as well. Only tried the calamari in that dish but it was easy to chew and the batter was light. The size of each individual ring was quite decent as well. The halibut had one large piece and a slightly smaller one, and was nice altogether. It was not dry and the lemon gave it a little kick at the end. Part of me wishes that the batter had a bit more flavour instead of being reliant on sauces. Fries were nice and crisp although I regretted not pairing it with gravy.   For the halibut and sampler at 16.99 and 20.99 respectively, the portions are absolutely huge for what you're paying. I was barely able to finish my plate, but my coworker had at least half of his plate still remaining (and we were both STARVING prior to walking in.) Not sure when I'll return there as it was convenient during my summer work term, but this spot is definitely a Newmarket favourite."}
{"text":"So glad I got to visit this gem of a place!   Decor: I love the interior! From the brick walls to the pop of color booths to the chic wall lamps! Nicely decorated!   Service: Omg! I probably met the most amazing server! She was so cool! Very attentive even when she was serving so many customers :) Her name is Heather and I'll never forget her lol. I remember her asking us... \"So you'll be back here again? You're invited.\" Lol ... +++++   Food: Yummmm I ordered the halibut and chips and the batter was tasty and crispy, the fish was nice and moist, the chips tasted fresh! I'm drooling ..."}
{"text":"One of the best fish and chips place I've tried outside of the UK.  I had the haddock and chips.  Huge portion sizes at a reasonable price. The batter was light, thin and crispy. Fish was thick and moist. Chips were thick cut and double fried to perfection.  A member of my party had the smelt and chips. The smelts were breaded instead of batter but nicely seasoned and crispy.  Both dishes came with tarter sauce and a creamy coleslaw. The tarter sauce was home made and a perfect accompaniment to the fish. The coleslaw was a little bland and needed some seasoning. I prefer a vinegar based coleslaw with fried food to help cut the grease.  Nonetheless, the star was the fish and chips.  If you like fish and chips, it's worth the drive to Newmarket.  I will definitely return and try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Newmarket I didn't care to try chip and malt as I figured how good could fish and chips really be? Luckily my husband convinced me to give it a try because this is probably my favourite restaurant in town. I always order my fish grilled instead of deep fried and it's delicious especially when paired with their house made tarter sauce. If I'm eating healthy I get a side salad and all of them are awesome but if I'm indulging then I'll get their house made fries which are so delicious and very generous in serving size! Don't be afraid to try their non-fish options - their house burger was featured on blog TO for good reason! I'd say it's even better than the burgers you can get down the road at Ground Burger Bar (and their burgers are pretty damn good). But perhaps the best and most indulgent menu item of all is the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. I wish I had never tried it so that I wouldn't know what I'm missing when I'm trying to eat healthy! Keep up the awesome work Chip & Malt, we love you!"}
{"text":"We made a special trip up to Newmarket to get the best fish and chips on dry land.  Great service and food! Lots of chips, the fish portion is generous with a crispy, light batter.  Oh my did we get our fill!"}
{"text":"Best Fish and chips around!   The chips are homemade and superb. The batter on the fish is perfection. They have a choice of cod, halibut or pollock. If you come for lunch, share the chips and get an extra piece of fish!  The Posh Chips were divine as well.  Although I didn't have any, I heard the desserts were delish too!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tonight, we finally decided to go for a fish n chips evening at Chip+Malt restaurant located on Main street, Newmarket. While waiting to be seated, one could see how busy the restaurant was! Very good ambience, and the owner was very friendly and welcoming!  The menu had lot of options, but we tried the dinner portions for the following fish  options:  - Halibut   - Orange Roughy  Both came with coleslaw, and fries. Personally, i loved orange roughy, a white fish from NZ, but relatively more moist than Halibut. The portion was gracious, and, fish tasted delicious    Also ordered english onion soup ( was very delicious). My favourite is seafood clam chowder that i go for starters but could not order ( what a shame), as it had bacon. I suggest that they should have the non bacon option as well for those who have such dietary restrictions! For dessert, we ordered the potted triple chocolate trifle. Liked the presentation. It had fresh whip cream with chocolate chunks sprinkled on it. Underneath the whip cream, there was yummy choc brownie layer, followed by decadent smooth milk chocolate. The bottom most layer had chocolate mousse. Overall, the triple layer trifle was very delicious!   Overall, a very satisfying culinary experience!!"}
{"text":"3.5  When my hubby ordered the \"Big Bang\" they weren't kidding with the name!  We were in the area and Chip+Malt is one of Yelp's top 100 restaurants, soooo of course I had to come in for a bite.  I was in way over my head.  I ordered the orange roughy and chips. Now you don't see that every day or at every fish and chip eatery. The fish batter was nice and crisp light not overly thick.  My hubby ordered the \"Big Bang\" a bacon packed, cheese topped, chip filled burger with all the condiments.  Both plates came toppled with hand cut fries, coleslaw and all the fixings. A little on the dry side for the patty but overall good flavours.  **ALERT** if your not hungry do not come alone!  \"Big\" is definitely served up here. So is the service. Big fishing net of awesomeness! Heather our waitress was amazing.  Now even though I'm about to burst at the seams we had to try the Guinness ice cream! It's made in house the taste was amazing, only fault ours was over churned leaving little bits of butter for a grainy feel. Otherwise a great dessert.  Update correction: it's the Big Ben burger. I think I just got the bang from how enormous the servings are!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips around. Their fish chowder, although a thinner consistency is outstanding. I never have room for dessert but the one time I did their sticky toffee pudding is incredible. Very friendly service, this place makes my top 10."}
{"text":"Excellent and wide array of British style food, their fish and chips were particularly amazing."}
{"text":"Went for quick dinner on a Saturday night. Got in quickly and was greeted quickly by our waitress. Our orders were standard. Halibut, Calimari and chicken strips. All with fries. The meal came out fairly quick. All of it was super fried beyond golden. All of our food had this darkish brown fried look to it and while eating it you could tell it was over done since all of our food was easily separating from its fried exterior. In fact my daughters chicken could be broken open like a crab leg and the meat removed completely in tact from the fried breading. Same for the halibut and calamari. We were In and out in 30 mins. We didn't touch the mountain of fries. I was disappointed as this was my second time here. First time wasn't this bad, but still super greasy."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I went here for lunch today. 3 of us had the Halibut &Chips, 1 the Haddock & Chips, and 1 the Big Ben Burger.   Our service was friendly and speedy.   Everyone was very happy with their meal.   I had the Halibut which was really good but I almost got a burger. They are made from local beef and fresh ground every day.   I'm looking forward to eating here again and would recommend it to everyone to try."}
{"text":"This is a new Fish n Chips place in New Market and I'm here to say \"Bravo\"! I'm giving this place 5/5 for the Food alone! I decided to order halibut & chips and fish  cakes & chips also a side order of 1 extra halibut.  My order was for takeout and to my delight their takeout boxes are tough sturdy quality decorative(newspaper print) boxes. The kind you could take back to the office and not end up with grease on your lap or table. Heck even walk down Main Street eating away. Ok enough about the Kool looking box.  The portion of fish is big & thick, that's the main thing I noticed when I took my first bite...not only batter as some places do to trick you. Finally a thick piece of fish! The batter was perfect, simple, crispy, not oily. It maintained crispy until I got it home to Aurora. (10-15mintues) this impressed me even more. That piece of halibut was cooked to perfection not dry but cooked fully. The fish cakes.2 pieces..oh man! They were made of Halibut! Huge and round, nice chunks inside mixed together with mashed potatoes with a dipping sauce. The seasoning was just right a good balance.  The potatoes are fresh peeled, in house cut & double fried for an authentic British chips. Yummy...again crisp & not greasy.  Their is a dining area consisting of about 14 booths that seat 4-6 at each booth.  If fish n chips is not your thing, don't worry they have Burgers, salads, chicken, shrimps & calamari too).  Oh and they told me they have Orange Rougy which is a very delicious delicate fish I haven't seen anywhere on the market for a long time in Canada. It's a fish usually found in Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom. I'm very excited to try theirs. Usually people who don't like fish like this fish because of its non fish taste.  Last thing is they have 5 different homemade sauces for your meals:  tartar, sriracha mayo, fancy sauce, c&m sauce and curry sauce.   I'm really glad to give this place a solid 5 stars which is impressive as they just opened. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Still one of my favourite restaurants on Main St.!  During our last visit, my husband ordered the shepherd's pie which was so good: so rich in flavour and the cheese melted on top of the potato topping made my own shepherd's pie PALE in comparison. I tried some gravy with my chips (as I had ordered a Yorkshire pudding) and enjoyed that as well (I'm a ketchup kind of girl). For dessert, we had their special which was a chocolate brownie layered with trifle and whipped cream. It was so decadent!  My update is meant to address the British decor and style at Chip+Malt. It's quite cool!  The last few times we went there, I noticed that the British/U.K. theme came through with their background music. Any time \"How Soon is Now\" by The Smiths is playing anywhere, it takes me back to high school and you have to stop what you're doing and sing along. And of course, whenever you hear \"You Spin Me Round (Like A Record),\" if you're an 80s fan like me, of course you will stop what you're doing and sing along even louder. I know none of this is related to the food but it made my experience there even better.  If you haven't been to Chip+Malt yet, stop, drop what you're doing, run over there and sing along while you eat a great meal!"}
{"text":"Quaint, clean, and mostly delicious.   The signature Orange Tuffy was a hit. Fluffy and light and not greasy.  We also really  enjoyed the Toad in the Hole (sausage, Yorkshire pudding, gravy, mashed potato), and Toffee pudding with homemade ice cream.   Items that were Ok: truffle fries, seafood chowder, this&that platter (suggest upgrading to halibut)  Would pass on: mushy peas (not much seasoning), bread and butter pudding (quite dry).   Service was ok (one who seemed like a newbie).  Will definitely go back if I'm ever in the mood for fish and chips."}
{"text":"Fish is very fresh and extremely tasty. Chips are done just right. Batter is light and crispy. Salad is delicious. The lady who is taking care of us is super lovely. Decor and ambiance is great."}
{"text":"I came here on Valentine's Day with no reservation, at 7, bad idea right? Fortunately, me and my boyfriend waited only 15 minutes for a table. I was worried that we would have to rush through dinner because they close at 8. The manager I'm amusing he was very very sweet, telling us it's not a problem and that to take our time.  We both order the haddock and chips. The portion sizes are HUGE. I had at least half of my fish left, and so many fries. The coleslaw was soooo fresh with a great church and sweet creaminess.   The tartar sauce was a little on the salty side for me, and maybe too much of a mayo ratio. And not enough tartness.  Lastly the sticky toffee pudding, was sooooooo warm and gooey greatness! It was on the sweet side but I mean dessert needs sugar! Also the portion is huge, my boyfriend and I couldn't even finish it we were sooooo full.  Overall the service was great! I cannot remember or servers name but she was sooo sweet. And food was delicious, portions are huge! The only thing I wish was that it were closer to home! Newmarket may sound close to Richmond hill but it's far!"}
{"text":"Good Friday out with the fam so we're obviously going to try out the fish n chips place my sister went to and loved.  We tried both haddock and halibut, as well as two of the salads.  The fish batter was perhaps the best I've ever tried. Light and crisp. The fish was cooked perfectly. The tartar sauce was authentic and the malt vinegar was plentiful for the double-fried chips. It was so good I doubled my order so I could take some home for later.  The one thing holding me back from a 5-star? The salads were boring and bland. Honestly you're not going to a place like this for salad but I was hoping for something a bit better. Great portion though.  The staff was excellent. Kind and attentive.  Definitely check this place out. I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"Great food and service here, super friendly place to eat out with friends and family. Love their sandwiches, poutine and onion rings, their portions are worth the price."}
{"text":"Very cute, local gem! Portions are huge and fish is very fresh. The service is delightful especially the waitress I had, made us feel like regulars for first-timers. Their fries are thick cut and mountainous (platefuls). Although their specialty is fried fish, my sister ordered the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich...amazing!! The seasoning was spot on, the chicken skin was very crisp while meat stayed moist. I would definitely recommend visiting this joint!"}
{"text":"I've never tried fish and chips before because they always looked pale and pasty and boring, but then i stumbled on this place and changed my mind. Their fish was deep-fried to a perfectly crispy golden brown and the inside was soft and flaky. The chips were delicious too, but if you're here, you might as well try their sticky toffee pudding. It's to die for! The portions here are pretty big though - my date had to finish my dinner and we had to share dessert. Customer service isn't bad either. Would definitely come again :)"}
{"text":"Wow. On a lovely Saturday evening, my friend had suggested we go get some fish and chips before heading to see a flick. At about 6:30 we were told we were facing about a 15-20 minute wait. We could tell right off the bat how popular Chip and Malt is. At the Cache event Kris had told us they actually imported special frying/cooking equipment from the U.K. for a authentic fish 'n chip experience. From the sleek and clean design, with intimate booths stretched end to end and the kitchen off to the side, you can sense a true pride of ownership.   We decided in the original haddock and fish, with a pint of Guinness as out beverage of choice.served with a generous side of coleslaw and target sauce and 'chips,'  we knew we wouldnt leave hungry. The fish itself was moist, meaty and was the star of the plate. In other words, it was not buried in an oily batter you would commonly see in other restaurants. You can tell this is the stuff, homemade, fresh to order, and a true U.K. experience. Hence, the line ups for days out the door. The servers were enthusiastic and helpful, with a bit of a hiccup with paying the bill near the end (we knew you were busy guys!).   Having been to Main Street for tea, Cache event, Hungry Brew Hops, the area is truly jumping. Chip and Malt is truly one of a kind. We definately cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The fish at Chip+Malt is fresh and also offers a variety of fish. I love that they have a range of sauces for you to choose from. I had the sirracha mayo which really complented the haddock. I also upgraded my chips to a poutine. There was so much of the poutine I couldn't finish it. The chower had plenty of ingredients and was lovely to have on a rainy and cold day.  The decor is modern and the restaurant is clean. The staff are really knowlegable and can introduce the different types of fish they offer to help you decide on your order.   Will definitely be back if I visit the Newmarket area. Also, forgot to try the Guinness ice cream which I saw on yelp."}
{"text":"Oh yessssss.... So like I'm supposed to be on a diet but I cheated because I needed to try this place, saw a bunch of good reviews so I took a walk down main street and popped in for some halibut and chips. I also noticed that there is Yorkshire pudding also available, the catch was that I had to wait because its made to order. Happy to wait I paid and took a walk around main street to kill time before my order was ready, about 10 mins later and I popped back in and everything was good to go. The fish was a generous portion and stacked on top a massive pile of chips in the nice take out boxes they have, with a separate box for my yorkies and a container of gravy. Everything was so yummy, the gravy had a nice garlicky tang to it and the Yorkshires were big and fluffy and amazing. I think this would be the best spot for fish and chips that I've gone to thusfar, check it out!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant, great food made wth fresh ingredients. the layout you have a chance to see the kitchen....which is always very busy :)  Their motto is \"get hooked\", I know I am. This is our favourite place for fish and chips. Their deserts are to die for too"}
{"text":"Definitely a reference point for fish and chips!  There are lots of places either serving fish and chips, or are restaurants dedicated to it.  They all have a bit to learn from Chips and Malt.  I had the haddock platter with coleslaw and tarter sauce at @12.99.  The fish was MASSIVE, sprawling across the whole plate and covering a good portion of the chips.  The batter was super crispy, nice and thin-not a big batter load.  The surface glistened with oil, one might think that this was going to be greasy, but no!  And the fish inside was the moistest and flakiest I have ever had.  The waitress urged me to take part of it home for later, but I didn't listen.  The chips?  Typical British style, but I did not want too much in the carb department, so I only had a few.  Besides, I had planned on ordering a desert.  So, the Sticky Toffee Pudding or the Bread and Butter Pudding?  I went for the Sticky Toffee, which is a dense cake, with a bottom that had hardened into a toffee layer, drenched in toffee sauce, and accompanied by a bowl of seriously good Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.  Ordering the Sticky Toffee was a mistake--I really wanted BOTH deserts.  Next time..."}
{"text":"Chris , great fish great place , wow I was truly impressed. Thx"}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday night and it was very busy.  That being said the wait wasn't too long before we got our table for 6 (2 adults and 4 kids.). Service was great and our waitress was very helpful and attentive.  Portions were huge.  We ordered Sheppard's Pie (a little bland), a haddock and chips (very flaky),a Big Crunch chicken buger (amazing), a Big Ben Burger (massive) and a regular burger.  Overall food was good but I do have a comment to make in regards to the gravy and poutine that the restaurant uses.  Our kids are poutine lovers and often send their dad's on \"poutine runs\" because they crave it so much.  They did not finish the poutine here because the gravy was quite gutless.  That being said that was only a small issue as the rest of the food was fine and the place is obviously known for its fish and chips, not poutine.  We didn't have room for dessert so I think next time, I would share some mains to have room because the dessert menu looked amazing.  Even as we left I was amazed that every server in the restaurant smiled and told us to have a good night.  I've never had that happen before and was very impressed. Great experience over all!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  I was in the area and just had to stop in again and this time try the Orange Roughy! Chris greeted us at the door and I casually mentioned that I was Debbie and that I said I would be back as the food is just that great! .. at the end of our most delicious meal - the orange roughy is seriously really good!! Chris gave me a gift card for my friend Diana because of the mishap with the salad issue. I thought that was so kind and thoughtful. He then also offered us free dessert today. I said that I absolutely appreciate the gift card and that he didn't have to pay for our desserts.  What a wonderful gesture though! I will definitely be bringing more people and clients to this wonderful restaurant. Thank you Chris. You have several new patrons because of your absolutely amazing food and your genuine generosity.  I have also mentioned this to the rest of the party who were with me yesterday and they said they will also bring others here for sure!   The food was fabulous!! Very tasty and great portions! We were a party of 4 and three of the party were seniors which was great as we saw down on the left corner there was a few specials for seniors! Cod and chips or Pollock and chips or fish cakes and chips I am pretty sure I remembered correctly. The price was a $4 savings. There was one piece of fish and large portion of fries for the seniors. I ordered the from the adult menu, not being a senior and switched with one of the senior men as I would prefer the smaller portion which was very large and filled the plate! I love my halibut also was skeptical at first to order the cod but the halibut wasn't offered to the seniors. Great choice as the cod was wonderful!!   One of the seniors substituted her fries for a salad as it mentioned that was allowed in the regular menu. The waitress never balked when she did this yet when she brought the bills, hers was more expensive as they charged her for a full salad!!! It was whacked! My friend questioned the waitress who stated it was not allowed if you ordered from the seniors area. That's just not right and we were quite put off by this.   The seats are booths which were comfortable. No place to hang your coats though. And the noise from the ventilation system was horrible. We had to yell to talk. Then when it went off it, we could talk normally. Hoping the air conditioner will not be as loud!!   The owner greeted us when we entered and also said goodbye which is always a most welcome touch.   Even with the noise, I will be back. Great place to work on reports or catch up on emails. Great food choices even have hamburgers and chicken. The parking however was scarce. I found a spot in the front just down from Botsford but the other three had to park in the back and there were not many spots available."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and came today with an associate. As most folks wrote, the food is great! Fish tastes fresh and the French fries are among the best in the area. Large portions and good value for even the hungriest.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Best halibut and chips outside the west coast of canada. Found this place when I was in Newmarket Main Street checking out other places to eat. The place was packed on a Friday night but service was awesome once I was seated. The chowder was one of the best I have had in some time. The fish was fresh and servings were large for the prices. Come hungry."}
{"text":"Best Fish and Chips in a long time. Read the reviews and everybody was absolutely right this is a great place the double fried fries where's spot on and our waitress was the nicest waitress I have been served by in a long time her name was Heather if you go there ask for her, just simply delightful. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, I've been to a lot of fish and chips restaurants and this one to me was okay. The fries was crunchy, the coleslaw was creamy, I found the fish too thick which made it a little bit fishy BUT that's my opinion because i tend to like an even amount of batter and fish, and last i find the tartar sauce the most important and it wasn't that good. Overall it was still good! There desserts though are GOOD. Would definitely come back for desserts !!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food, Had the halibut and chips with a side of mushy peas, the chips were fantastic and fish was good as well, generous portions and the batter on the fish was light and crispy great fish to batter ratio. Will be back. Mushy peas came out as a paste with a slight minty taste little too dry for my liking. The coleslaw would have preferred if less creamy and more vinegar. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"We came to Chip+Malt for dinner on a Friday night. I would recommend reservations as it does get very busy. First thing I noticed was the friendly staff. Our waitress Heather was so friendly and knowledgeable. She recommended the perfect items and described the menu perfectly.   My husband and I ordered the lamb burger to share and their fish special, an 8oz orange roughy and chips.  Everything is made fresh in house and even the lamb is ground in house. The burger was delicious we loved the goat cheese and how it pairs so well with  the lamb, as well the bread was warm and soft. I also upgraded the fries to a pouting which consists of house made gravy. That was also delicious. The Orange roughy fish was amazing and very big in size. Melted in your mouth after you bit through the thin crispy batter. I hear you can get the fish grilled too, but I'd definitely recommend fried.  They had a few house made sauces as well which went well for dipping the fries or the fish in something other than tartar. We tried the C+M sauce and the fancy sauce but they also had Sriracha mayo, and curry sauce. This was free of charge as well.   The highlight of my meal (even though everything was already amazing)  was dessert. We had their homemade seasonal ice cream, eggnog. This was made in house and it was so good. The texture was so smooth.   I will definitely be returning here for not only the food,  or the ice cream but the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Pretty impressed.  Actually I just got back from England and had an epiphany:  Most of the so called \"pubs\" we have here are crap.  Sorry but its true.  Many a pub in England featured the usual fair but with a homemade, locally-sourced, true-to-it's-roots foundation.  The same cannot be said for the typical frozen fair served around the GTA.  Now, Chip+Malt is not a pub, bit their attention to detail and ingredients reminded me of the best England had to offer.  Right down to the real English malt vinegar bottles that adorn the table.  Shepherds Pie: nice big portion, full of ground lamb with not too much filler (read:vegetables).  After all this is English food, the only vegetable is potato!  Fried Smelts:  Awesome.  Seasons welled and fried super crispy.  The Chips were excellent and exactly like the local \"Chippys\" outside of Liverpool.  Toad in a hole:  My son liked it.  Sausages were different than your usual bangers.  Seasoned nicely.  Decor:  Modernish..  Clean..  Pleasant.  Love the British paraphernalia on the walls.  Overall:  Another great addition to the growing arsenal of decent restaurants on Main St.  It's nice to see variety and quality building up an area that for years was neglected."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to have lunch here on Main Street Newmarket today....what a fun, classy place! Great atmosphere, friendly, knowledgable staff...and the menu!...Totally authentic U.K.!! I had the all-time best halibut and chips ever. My husband, who is very picky, enjoyed every bite of his \"This and That\" lunch: chips+cod, calamari and breaded shrimp. Every bite. Nice side of coleslaw too. The piece de resistance was their wonderful sticky toffee pudding with house-made vanilla bean ice cream. Fantastic! The place was full of regulars, and we could see why! This is a shining star on Main Street Newmarket!"}
{"text":"The 5-star rating is given based on a process of deduction:  1) BF ordered Shepherd's Pie ($14).  BF said 3 times \"this is so good\" while he ate it.  Then he made me take a picture to show how much ground lamb and how little fillers (only few bits of mixed vegetable) there was.  He also said this was a back-to-basic Shepherd's Pie minus the internal organs.   2) I ordered a Haddock and Chips ($13).  The haddock fillet was very big.  The batter was thin, yet it packed with crunches.  It was a great batter.  The fillet inside was steamy hot, moist and tasted fresh and delicious.  The chips were made from real potato, not from a frozen bag.  I could taste the difference.  Every table had a bottle of malt vinegar and ketchup.  The malt vinegar perfected the fries.  This came from me, someone who loves ketchup and eats fries because she wants to eat ketchup.  3) We ordered Guinness Ice Cream ($5).  It was an ice cream made in-house.  It was quite rich.  We could taste a hint of the beer in it.  4) Services was very good for this visit.  We were seated promptly.  During our meal, the waitress asked us at least 4 times how we liked our meals or if everything was okay.  Plus twice more when we ate dessert and when we asked for the bill.  While this could be annoying to some, I have to give her points for enthusiasm.   5) The decoration is British themed.  There are booths with rustic looking gas lamps.  There is a hero poster featuring Churchill.  Ambiance is casual, modern with a hint of nostalgia.  This is not your traditional mom and pa shop decoration.  The kitchen is a see-through kitchen, meaning it is adjacent to the dining area, with the top half of the wall made of glass.  Customers can look at the actions inside.  I liked how clean the kitchen looked.  6) Pricing is reasonable given the portion and quality.   This is no fine dining.  This is not even upscaled casual.  This is classic food cooked the old fashioned way, with the ingredients modernized to suit modern palette.  The price is right. The services is good.  The ambiance is modern enough to attract the younger generation yet throwback enough to attract the mature generation.    5 stars for it is what it is. And an applause from me for it craving a niche for itself."}
{"text":"Going by memory here from a lunch in November 2016. Haddock n Chips had a serious but light crunch coating, generous portion. The fries were meaty and brown and abundant. Also they had Innis and Gunn beer which is hard to find. Friendly service, and the atmosphere was clean.  While I still think the best fish n chips is way over in St. John's Newfoundland, but that would be six stars, and Newmarket is, well, closer."}
{"text":"Excellent place for fish and chips. Batter was thin and crispy. Fish was tender and juicy. Chips were crispy and light. Very cozy and friendly environment. Service was excellent. Overall, best fish and chips in the GTA."}
{"text":"Best service I've ever had in a restaurant. Waitresses are super friendly from the moment you walk in and always very helpful. Portions are very generous. Fish was delicious. The halibut is worth paying extra for!"}
{"text":"i'm from California and I thought I'll try this  fish and chip in place Ontario  I can say to people there  we're very nice. Service was good.I tried  the Hollibut and it was very good. i'll definitely come  to this place."}
{"text":"I finally made the trip up to main street Newmarket on a Friday night to get some fish and chips, they were quite busy, we were told a 25 minute wait time but we were seated in about 15. The staff are all very friendly.  Chip+Malt is probably the best fish and chips I've had in a very long time, though deep fried everything... I would only come here once in a very long while as I immediately felt my throat starting to hurt! The portions are pretty generous, we ordered the this + that sampler (calamari, cod, shrimp, chips), halibut & chips and haddock and chips for four people, it was plenty, could've fed five people no problem.  My favourite was definitely the halibut & chips, delicious batter perfectly deep fried and the fish was nice and moist. The pricing is reasonable (~$19, $15, $12, respectively) and you can always ask for more tartar sauce (which is very important for me as I love my condiments!). They also offer a handful of other specialty sauces such as curry sauce, sriracha mayo, c+m sauce at no extra charge..just ask!  Also noted on the menu is deep fried mars bar and Guinness ice cream that I would love to come back to try.  There is plenty of parking in the lot behind the main street; perfect stroll to walk off all the delicious food that can be had here!"}
{"text":"5 stars from me!  Came here with some girlfriends on a Saturday afternoon lunch date. We were all very, very satisfied with our visit. Our server was amazing. Amazing enough that I even told her in person how we've been admiring her services. Let me lay this out for you; a girlfriend ordered a cappuccino/latte thing and when she had finished, the server brought over a glass of water for her without question. Maybe you're thinking \"wow okay she brought water\" but seriously, it seems like we have to ask for everything these days, they aren't just given to you. This small yet powerful gesture really won us over. Not only that, she actually communicated with us and had a conversation. It was friendly and I was a fan.  I ordered halibut & a large serving for coleslaw. Both were incredible. The halibut is where it's at. My other girlfriends portions were huge. Like actually so massive. She ended up taking one home which I later read was 10 inches long. Be sure to visit with an appetite.  My cappuccino/latte girlfriend ordered the poutine and chowder. While she was loving her poutine, she did mention the chowder didn't live up to her east coast standards. I think maybe it was a bit more soupy and less chowdery.  I will 100% return because this is the best fish + chips place I have been to in a long, long time. The breading was so crispy, not one bit of saugy-ness."}
{"text":"A very friendly atmosphere. Excellent service, very generous portions and delicious food. The staff are very attentive. Love halibut and chips meal. A little hint they give you way too many fries. You can order a halibut meal and order a side of fish and split the fries from the meal."}
{"text":"First time there tonight and had a great experience. Halibut and chips and coleslaw was delicious! Friendly service, nice atmosphere. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot in Newmarket! Great service and a delicious meal for a reasonable price! Will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Chip n' malt a gem in casual dining. The menu has a British Style fare with Halibut and Chips being my favorite.  I have eaten here 3 times and every time the food is fresh, delicious and staff are always very nice.  They have a huge menu and maybe next time I will try something different.  The halibut is deep fried in a light crisp batter and the fries are cut from locally grown potatoes.  What can I say 5 stars every time.  Parking is in the back of Main Street. Take out is available. Will be going back I am sure in the near future."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about C&M!  We've been here numerous times and it's alway fantastic.  I thought I wrote a review already actually!  So, I'll say it now...get over here...we usually don't even get the fish and chips because everything else on the menu is outstanding.  They serve one of my favourite burgers on the planet.  It's a griddle top burger that gets that nice crust on the outside....nothing fancy, just an all around amazing burger.  Shephard's pie is great and the fish cakes are too.  Don't be shy about subbing a salad for your fries...the Brighton salad can be subbed for a few bucks more and it's really nice...strawberries, pecans, goat cheese...just great.  Guiness stew is another fav.  Stay for dessert...scratch mad sticky toffee pudding is unreal.  Service is always great...and in particular, Heather is always a ray of sunshine!"}
{"text":"This place has a diner type feel to it, with the booth seats. It has a casual ambiance.   The service was decent, not spectacular but not bad at all. We were promptly seated and handed menus as soon as we walked in.   The menu has quite a lot of selection but there really isn't much for vegetarians (minus half a star). I ordered the blakened chicken sandwich since I don't eat seafood but was with someone who really wanted to come to this place for the fish and chips. All 3 of us being British were excited to find a chip shop with British style chips. Unfortunately, I did not like the chips very much (minus the other half star). They were fresh cut and I think would have tasted amazing but they were extremely dry and seemed like they had been in the fryer for too long. I hope the next time I come by this isn't the case. The chicken sandwich however, was absolutely amazing! The chicken was nicely spiced and the toppings were very complementary. The bun was so fresh and soft and just perfect! The only thing thing was it was slightly too salty for me.   I thought the prices were fair as well. I'm just disappointed in the chips, something I miss about England. I guess I'll just have to hold out until I'm in England next! I highly recommend coming here (even if you are far from Newmarket), if not just for the fish. I did try a small piece and it seemed really well cooked and fresh."}
{"text":"While there is now no shortage of interesting restaurants on Main Street, Chip and Malt is a real welcome addition to increasing the diversity on the strip. With a primarily British menu offering, you have large variety of different styles of fish, different species and all served with a heap of chips, the way it's meant to .   Service is very friendly and accommodating. The space is very impressive as well, with many booths. It's just a comfortable and friendly place, where you know you're getting your money's worth."}
{"text":"Very fresh tasting every time I go there! Servings are huge also- get the family pack if you can and share the fries. There are seafood sandwich and po'boy options if you aren't into fish and chips. Delicious desserts also!"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  Fish and Chips is one of those dishes that done well is a death row quality indulgence. However almost nowhere does it well. Greasy, overcooked fish and  packaged, cloying tartar sauce is the standard.  Enter Chip and Malt.  The portions are huge, the fish is tender and flaky, and not at all greasy. The tartar sauce and coleslaw are housemade and delicious. The thick cut UK style chips finish off the meal perfectly. This is fish and chips done right.  The service was absolutely delightful. The decor was thematic and inviting. I'll be eating here again so I can try the rest of the menu. Can someone recommend me a gym? I'm going to need it."}
{"text":"Finally, a great fish and chip joint where I can eat IN and not worry about a grumpy old man yelling at the server or popping out his dentures to clean them. This place is modern, clean and comfy with a pub feel. The fish is flaky, not greasy, batter crunchy  and doesnt leave u feeling gross  (assuming u had 1 piece). Chips are good too -. one portion is enough for two to share. I recall a decent pub menu for the landlubbers, but I've only gone for the fish. Price and portion size is good. Only problem for me is the hours - haven't gone as often as would like or with friends as they close quite early."}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is really good. Heather and Holly are fantastic server's. The chowder is delicious.  The Yorkshire pudding is amazing.  I have never had poutine before but l had it here because of the cheese curds which cone from Quebec wow l am now lover of this great dish. The restaurant washrooms are clean the restaurant is spotless.  I am now a new convert to this fabulous restaurant.  The only thing I have to say that is critical is that the entrance door is not equipped for the disabled. No power door and trying to get in with my wheelchair is very difficult. I hope they get a door that is automatic. Other than that you must eat here you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Recently heard about Chip+Malt from one of my clients and decided to drive up to Newmarket for a feast!   Wait time wasn't too long for a table on Friday night. It looks like a small shop from the front, but there are plenty of booths as you walk further inside.  My client did rave about the Seafood Chowder, so the hubby and I shared one as our starter. It was 2 ladles full of delicious, chunky and hearty ingredients! However, it was a bit too buttery for my liking but hubby loved it and devoured the rest of the bowl lol.  We ordered 2 fish and chips combo. The Orange Roughy fish was flaky and soft, while the Halibut was firm but tender. Both are very delicious with a light, crispy batter. We upgraded one side of chips to a poutine (+$2.99). I must say, the poutine was quite heavenly - freshly cut potatoes, creamy gravy, and melty cheese curds - you have to try this :D Each combo also came with a side of coleslaw and a nice cream of tartar sauce. If you think this is too much food for you (FYI, it is A LOT of fries!), you have the option to just order one piece of fish instead of the combo   Make sure you save room for dessert! We ended the night with a Sticky Toffee Pudding and a housemade Guinness ice cream! The pudding was so good that hubby could not even respond for a good 5 minutes when I continued to ask him how it was lol. Personally, I really enjoyed the Guinness ice cream. I love the taste of a strong, dark beer :) This definitely made my day.  Service was excellent - very friendly and attentive - thank you Heather! Definitely would recommend Chip+Malt if you're craving for fish and chips in the area :)"}
{"text":"Halibut + Orange Roughy & Chips  The portions were HUGE! Definitely worth the price of $16 each. The halibut was flakey and cooked perfectly, it was delicious. Now I had the catch of the day : orange roughy (which I've never had in my life) it was described as a cross between halibut and haddock and it honestly was amazing.  The atmosphere and the staff were fantastic. It's a place I would definitely go back to. Probably to try something else on the menu"}
{"text":"Food was decent but i think they should relax on their serving sizes. I just dont like the fact that they serve this humongous plate of food that make you go \"great, now its my responsibility to finish this now.\"   I know there's a takeout option but i'd rather pay less and get spared subpar quality take home fish and potatoes.   I just suggest less serving portions for less the cost. Other than that, food was great, place looked nice and servers were helpful!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 6 stars. I love love love fish and chips and the halibut and chips was one of the best I've ever had. It hit the spot perfectly. The burger and chips was also incredible.   Chip+Malt exceeded my expectations and I this is definitely my new go-to. All of the staff were kind, pleasant, and welcoming and really made this an exceptional experience. A special shoutout to our waitress Heather. Her alone will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the fish and chips there. Although the reviews were quite good I didn't have very high expectations. To my surprise the portion of fish was generous. The service was great there too."}
{"text":"One of the best fish&chip places we've been! The food is always good, tasty and fresh.  The service is great in general, but servers love to stick together and we usually have hard time to get their attention to order something else. Overall the place is definetely worth the try!  Thumb up for Halibut+chip and Blackened Chicken sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good. The fish and chips are to die for and the service is almost always great. My kids and I just love it. Lots of variety in their menu for a fish and chip joint. Even have good salads. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Well I have been looking for a classic fish and chips place to try. The staff are great here. I ordered the halibut and chips it was the best I ve had. My son had the haddock and he loved it.We had onions rings to start they were fantastic. A great surprise was they serve Innis & Gunn beer. We will be back thank you Chip and Malt"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fish and chips guy and my initial plans didn't include going to Chip+Malt while road tripping around Newmarket but I was extremely glad I ended up coming here!  The servers here are outstanding! Very friendly, helped us navigate the best of the best at their restaurant and were lovely to have a chat with.  Chip+Malt prides on their sustainable fish, ordering them fresh locally, and it really shows in their food.  The wife and I ordered the Halibut and Chips and the Shrimp Po Boy. The halibut is really light, crispy and flavourful (and this is coming from a person who doesn't like fish). It's hard to describe how much better it is than other places, but you'll understand when you try it out.  The Shrimp Po Boy has a really nice seasoning and holds its crunchiness well despite the light batter. When I was told they had a curry dip, I HAD to get it. If it's anything like the curry ketchup I had in Germany, I would be happy.... and boy was I happy.  The fries themselves were very well portioned and were very well done - complimented the star of the dish really nicely.  I didn't get a picture of it, because it was SOOO good, but after our pleasant conversation with one of the waitresses, we ended up getting the Sticky Toffee Pudding as well. GODSEND. I'll leave it at that.  If you're in the Newmarket area, CHECK THIS PLACE OUT. I almost missed out on one of favourite restaurants outside of the GTA, and you shouldn't too. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I was running an errand in Newmarket and needed to grab lunch and stopes by Chip+Malt and I am so glad I did! It's such a cute and quaint fish n' chips place with very friendly staff. I got the recommended orange roughy w/ the seafood chowder and it was delicious. The orange roughy was perfectly crisp and I was happy my server suggested it. I will definitely come back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Super friendly staff. We had the hamburger and a halibut and chips. Extremely fresh and tasty. The chips and all sauces were amazing. The hamburger was a delicous home made patty. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"4 Star + 1 Star for the Daily Special  Chip+Malt maybe the best Fish and Chip joint in GTA! It is worth the drive to Newmarket!  The decor is nice and playful.  The seating is comfy. The service is super friendly.  Where else can I get a Haddock with Chips for $10.99?!   The fish is fresh. The batter is light and crispy. The fries is crispy golden.  Sticky Toffee Pudding ($6.99) with Guinness Ice Cream ($1) - Rich and heavenly. More a brownie texture.    Sadly Yorkshire Pudding not ready for lunch. I have to come back during dinner.  Chip+Malt is a 5 Star experience for me!"}
{"text":"We stopped by last night for some fish and chips. Both ordered the halibut and chips, was not disappointed at all. Batter quite thin and crispy, fish was fresh and dense. Chips cooked to perfection and also thick and fresh.  Rest of the menu looked quite good as well. Will be exploring other items when we do go back, which will be soon.  Ambiance is what I would call \"modern etsy\", lots of neat little touches but nothing pretentious or over the top.  Prices very reasonable as well.   This might just be our go-to fish n chips place!"}
{"text":"This place on main st. Newmarket is very nice! Don't let the small store from fool you. The seating is plentiful and is quite spacious once you enter and see that the restaurant stretches deep into the building. The decor is what you would expect from a fish and chips place: wood floors and by-the-sea color scheme. The place is clean and had a very fresh feel (newly opened) which I liked a lot. They got a pretty awesome Dyson hand dryer. Anyway to the food!... The servings are hearty and the was cooked quite well and was tasty -- exactly what fish and chips should taste like. Service was very reasonable and friendly. This is a great addition to main st. Newmarket and it fits right in."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and a classic diner type of setting. The food was good, their fish and chip wasn't  overloaded with batter like some places. It was a  decent size fish under their thin batter that felt light. Surprisingly not just their fish and chip that was good but also their dessert! Got to try their Sticky toffee pudding if you get a chance, it was amazing."}
{"text":"First impression: very cute, friendly and a bit of a hipster joint.  The staff here are super friendly and the food here is superb! They definitely capture the entire English/Irish feels of fish n chips culture with imported Malt vinegar and homemade Guinness ice cream.   My friend and I came here for a quick bite, I got the cod-wich and it did not disappoint. Huge portion of a fresh fried piece of cod, fresh light coleslaw and pickled onions all packed and spilling out of a toasted brioche bun. It was tasty and filling but it didn't leave you feeling gross and greasy. And the chips! Omg huge pile of them with free gravy on the side and I have say some of the best gravy I've had in awhile, the perfect amount of savoury and richness.   This place is definitely a must try! I can't wait to come here again and try everything else."}
{"text":"Prime location on Main Street Newmarket and it's a small and quaint location.  Very busy location but well worth the wait!! We started both with soups...a Seafood Chowder and a Onion Soup.  Seafood chowder was packed with fish, substantial portion and very delicious!  The Onion soup had leeks, Onion, cheese and sage and was so good!  We both had fish in chips, my friend had the halibut and I had the orange roughy.  Halibut was great but Orange Roughy Fish was by far the best!! So tender and sweet....was a hit!  Did I say how great the staff and servers are? Will definitely be back!!"}
