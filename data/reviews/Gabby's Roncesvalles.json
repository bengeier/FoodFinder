{"text":"The Gabbys chain makes no sense to me. 

First of all they have like 600 things on the menu, which sounds like good selection but it's all done equally poorly. 

I have been to three different Gabbys over the last year ( not my choice, just worked out that way). 

The one at bloor and spadina. Had the wings, 2 out of 5 tiny, and tasteless. 

The one on Ronces. Took the waitresses advice, had the roast beef sandwich. Was roast beef on a wonder bread style bun. 2 out of 5

The one on king. Had the burger, it was fine as cheap burgers go. Nothing special. 2.5 out of 5. 

Cmon guys you have a nice big franchise, shoot the line cooks and hire a young chef."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a drink and some cheap food. Every item on the menu is great, the Caesars are awesome especially the one with pickle juice! The service is fantastic. Lucy is a sweetheart, my boyfriend and his friends would go here for lunch when they were working in the area and she was always providing quick service and was always very friendly!
This is a great place if your looking for yummy consistent bar food!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the other Gabby's around town, but if they're anything like this one, they're pure middle of the road. It's got that pub/sports bar hybrid atmosphere, the usual selection of Americana comfort food, and a respectable, if unchallenging, bar service.

I was here not long ago with a friend who was on a quest to find good bourbon on Roncies, and we came away from Gabby's disappointed. They do, however, have tallboy deals and Martini Mondays ($5 each). If you go for the latter, make sure you get a dirty Martini instead of the classic, because it has more booze--and, to be pedantic, a classic Martini should be made with gin, not vodka, anyway."}
{"text":"That's a great place, have good food and darts to play. 
The waitress Ariadne is friendly all the time and very helpful. On the other hand the waiter Brian is the kind of person you should avoid.  Not only impolite but also rude and arrogant in a way that make me leave early the place."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken club sandwich and it was disgusting. I don't know what they put in it, but it wasn't chicken breast. Tasted like egg or something, some sort of formed imitation chicken meat (think pink slime!) I wouldn't go there again, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Seems that most reviewers for the Gabby's on the Roncy strip like to bitch about the service and, they say, poor quality food. Hmm.

Ok: yes, the wings are scrawny. Go to Loon, or even Wild Wing, further north for that. But I love their Turf&Turf burger, which is BBQd pulled pork and cheese on top of a prime rib burger. So good, I'll risk another heart attack for one.

As for the service, well, only once has a server failed to sufficiently kiss my ass (read: provide me with \"customer service\"), so I have no complaints."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and efficient, but the major downfall of this place is the sub-par food and how much it costs. Ordered a chicken wrap with sweet potato fries and it looked like something you would get at a cafeteria. The food tasted decent but barely filled the plate, making the overall presentation seem sparse and cheap. And this cost me something like 12-13 dollars?!

My friend ordered a pound of chicken wings and these little guys were so tiny! I made a joke that they looked more like squirrel legs. You could down one of these wings in about two bites. I guess they figure a lot of little wings looks better than a few big ones?

They do have some nice specials (like cheap tall cans of beer on Tuesdays) but even though I am relatively new to the Roncesvalles area I am certain there must be better options for pub fare."}
{"text":"The beer is good servers are good, but anyone who thinks cooking is using a microwave needs to retire and get out of the business my nachos are rubbery, and you can taste the microwave.. and they say it has chicken but it's processed chicken. If they were saying they use sandwich meat.. 
Great service though and beer just food has allot to be desired"}
{"text":"We are living around this place and I believe it's one of the best places either for lunch or dinner. Tasty food, decent beer and good old British pub style."}
{"text":"I order from Gabbys all the time from JUST EAT and the food here is always well prepared  and fair size portions

I decided to visit the location but it turns out that Gabby's is actually a chain and not all restaurants offer the full menu. So you are left with a very small bar food type deep-fried menu to choose from while you're in the establishment, The waiter was nice enough but he failed to recognize I was at the restaurant with a service animal and told me I would need to hide it when it was wearing it's service animal vest. He did apologize right away and made it better, altogether this place is more of a drinking establishment bar type, The cinnamon poppers were the best thing on the menu"}
{"text":"Listen, this place is A-OK.
I see a few negative reviews because you're sad that a chain bar/pub didn't serve you a scrumptious meal. Let me break it to you, kid. You can't order chicken sandwiches, pizzas and salads at Gabby's and expect to get Moxie's quality food. Look at where you are for a minute, the place is dark, they have big TV's, a small kitchen with probably just one cook and one, at most two bartenders that double as waitresses. You're not going to be mind-blown with the food, you just won't.

For those complaining about the price, please read:
This is a good no frills place with great beers on tap, and 1/2 price wings on Monday and Wednesday. Be smart and buy your 2 lb wings for $10.99, beer on tap is 6-7 bucks... You have yourself a cheap eat with beers for under 40 bucks for 2 ppl and big screen TV's for your sports/game watching. What more do you want?

Be smart, people. Understand where you're going and you'll be happier with the place. 
You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Nice relaxing Sunday afternoon watching da Bears. At first I thought \"average\" and then the bartender clued me in that they also have Beau's Lug Tread.  Yay!  

They have several televisions which was great for opening weekend of the regular NFL season.  

Bathrooms are clean.  Big plus!"}
