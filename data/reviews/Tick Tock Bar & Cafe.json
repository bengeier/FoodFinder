{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday for lunch. I ordered fried zucchini and a grilled chicken salad. First word that comes to mind is, \"WOW!\" The food was so good! Fried zucchini was so good and so hot, you can tell they were freshly made.  The chicken salad was huge too! Unfortunately, I'm on a low carb diet and didn't realize it came with French fries, so I picked them all out.  So for the non-locals....salads come with French fries out here ;)  Overall, the staff was friendly and attentive. I will definitely return again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Very limited menu but what they offer is very good. Decent prices and interior is nice."}
{"text":"Bad from the start. *Party of 2 & we get 1 menu. *Bartender doesn't know the soup special & its already 2:30 pm.  She then informs us that the food actually comes from the deli section and that the deli is a separate business.  So she walks over to the deli which basically is 2 sections over (deli, pool table area, bar). Comes back and says there is no special.  And we can order food from her and she will take the order over there and she will take our cash or credit card over there also to pay.  You pay her for only the drinks.   *We order 2 wedding soups - not bad tasting but served luke warm.   *We order meatball hoagie & hot sausage hoagie - served barely luke warm.  Hot sausage appeared like it had been reheated for several days.  We hardly ate half of the hoagies *Place is asking for a case of food poisoning. Stay far away from the food! *ONLY good thing was the building was nicely renovated with doors that slide open & can be kept open."}
{"text":"We purchased takeout subs for dinner. An Italian and some sort of sausage meatball sub. Not bad, i would order again. I've never gone in so I can not say much for the environment but there seems to always be a crowd here."}
{"text":"I didn't like this place at all I don't know how they call them self a cafe it's a bar with a deli next to it not a very good atmosphere wish I would have went somewhere else"}
{"text":"Tic Toc  deli has amazing sandwiches. I recommend the H H Robertson hot Italian. Prices are good. Will definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"The Tick Tock has a long history in Ambridge, ranging back to the '50s. I was never interested until it came under new ownership a few years ago. They cleaned it up, revamped a lot of the menu, and added on a variety of brews.  I stopped in for a work lunch, so I didn't get to sample the beer. The food was good, though. They have a fairly small menu that focuses mainly on standard bar food for this area: big sandwiches and sides. My pulled pork sandwich had a tasty (if dry) bun, but the meat was really good. The big winner, though, were the fries. The were on the huge side of things, and were seasoned just the right way.   Prices were really good, and the staff was super friendly. The place is divided in three sections, too: a deli/kitchen area with limited seating, a larger, open air section with a pool table, and the bar. The subdivision is actually really cool. Smoking is permitted here, for those who care, and I appreciate that it's possible to avoid it entirely thanks to the three sections."}
{"text":"This place is great. While I cannot speak to the bar side of the business, Tick Tock's cafe portion was a good place to grab a quick bite to eat over my lunch break. As a hoagie lover, I was impressed with their Italian hoagie, which paired well with the wedding soup. All of the employees were very welcoming and easy to talk to. The cafe had a great vibe. I will definitely be stopping back."}
