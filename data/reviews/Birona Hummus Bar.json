{"text":"If you like simple food like falafel, but want to pay way more than other places and wait extra long to receive it, you will love this place. Seriously, $9 falafel? Expensive pints of bad local beer like Cheval Blanc?"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the ambiance and tasty hummus in this bright lunch spot. My ashkara hummus and my husband's shakshuka hummus were both a hit. Walking around Mile End is a treat too. Would return!"}
{"text":"Moi qui n'était pas une fan du hummus, je suis littéralement tombée en amour avec cette endroit. Le restaurant offre des portions généreuses autant pour les salades que pour les hummus. C'est LE paradis pour les personnes qui adorent le hummus, puisque vous pouvez retrouver des variétés végétariennes ou carnivores. Si vous n'avez pas le temps de manger au restaurant, il y a un comptoir également. Une place idéale pour partager un repas entre amis!"}
{"text":"Even though Birona is delicious spot to grab a sandwich, it's a great hummus bar for lunch. You'll find all kind of hummus, tahina, sabih, falafel with great salade. The atmosphere is modern and cool. Fresh ingredient.

We were four and each ordered a difference dish. We got schnitzel sandwiches, Abeille Salad and a Jerusalem hummus to share. It's a must"}
{"text":"Full disclosure?: I love hummus.

Went here for a weekend brunch and despite being a group of Middle Eastern food afficionados, we were not disappointed.

We split a bourekas plate, which was essentially a sabich sandwich in a boureka. It doesn't get much better than that for comfort food.

We then shared the brunch plate which included eggs cooked to our preference (shakshuka!), hummus, eggplant with feta, fu'ul (which was surprisingly light), and cabbage. There was probably more food, but the list was too long to remember. It also came with a glass of not overly sweet lemon pomegranate juice.

The chef and owner came out to talk to us and he couldn't have been nicer. He saw that there was a baby toddler at the table and offered to make some scrambled eggs and veggies, free of charge. He then brought us tahini-chocolate bars for dessert.

Looking forward to many more visits to Birona!"}
{"text":"Amazing hummus, so fresh, tastes nothing like the store bought ones. Got the Le Geneva (?) Hummus with beef, red peppers and mushrooms. Got the Gia's salad that when mixed up is a solid salad."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is simple. When you order a plate of hummus, it comes with a coleslaw salad and a small pita plate.

They also have salads (make your own or choose from the menu), and sandwiches.

The interior is gorgeous, it's a nice open restaurant with plants hanging and light streaming in. Very clean. 

Service was fast, we were given a number and were able to sit down anywhere we wanted. It took about 5 minutes to get our food after we ordered at the bar.

The hummus was delicious. I got the traditional which is just hummus, tahini, and chick peas. The presentation was beautiful and the portion was more than I could handle. If you try it out, just know it's enough food for two. 

The staff was a bit shy, which is normal since they just opened. But I wish there was a bit more guidance. Since it was my first time I wanted them to give me recommendations. They also kept trying to hurry our visit. They passed by often to ask if we were done. 
For example: when the pita plate was empty they took it away even though we were still eating the hummus and salad. 

It was a bit annoying. I wanted to enjoy my time with my boyfriend but it didn't feel very relaxing.

Overall, good food and good portions. I will come back and try the rest of the menu for sure."}
{"text":"I liked the Moroccan Hummus. Good option for a quick lunch. Fresh,  healthy,  satisfying. Nice big communal tables. Go for something you never tried. I liked the original dishes rather than the traditional ones. If you go with a friend take one Hummus plate and one pita sandwich and share."}
{"text":"This place was great. A friend of mine picked it out because we had some vegans in our group... I likely wouldn't have picked a hummus bar for dinner but boy was I wrong. The place was quant and from what I understood was only recently opened. The food was all delicious.... and they had tequila! A hummus bar and tequila? Sold! Service was good. Everyone was very friendly. 

Definitely check this place out. You will not be disappointed. 

Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Very underwhelming. The sign outside the restaurant per claim that I had the best hummus in Montreal. I found it to be one more bladder hummus is I've had in a long long time. The Decour of the restaurant was very sterile and there is only one employee working. The presentation is very nice but I do not think I shall be returning."}
{"text":"I have had the chance to eat here on three separate occasions and each time the food was great and very consistent. The hummus was very good and fresh but the real stand out is the Shakshuka, unbelievably good, there are two versions and I recommend them both. I also tried the falafel which is by far the best I've ever had. 

The place is very trendy and maybe a little artsy, not very comfortable for a long dinning experience. There are two very large \"community\" tables, one small round table for four people and two bar style tables with extremely uncomfortable stools. 

I've always had the same server and she is extremely friendly and the food is served quite quickly which is good because you really don't want to be stuck sitting on those stools for to long. 

The food is fresh, homemade and you can tell that they care about what is served. The only downfall about the menu is that you can not get a traditional Coke or Pepsi, all of their drinks are artisanal and not really my taste."}
{"text":"Peu importe si vous vous considérez comme un hummusexual ou si vous êtes simplement à la recherche de nouvelles expériences: Birona est un restaurant à essayer! Vous avez le choix entre plusieurs plats principaux: spécialités à base de hummus, sandwichs et salades. Dans tous les cas, il y a beaucoup d'options végétariennes disponibles (au moins la moitié du menu, si ce n'est plus) et une salade de chou est incluse en entrée. Gérez vos attentes, par contre: si vous prenez une des spécialités, vous aurez essentiellement du hummus (avec quelques variations comme des poivrons, de la sauce piquante, une salade de fèves noires, etc.) et du pain pita chaud. C'est tout! Les portions sont largement raisonnables et le hummus est délicieux mais, une fois mon assiette terminée, je n'ai pas eu le sentiment d'avoir profité d'un \"vrai\" repas. J'aurais aimé davantage de variété. En fait, un plat de dégustation aurait été l'idéal! Mes conseils: si vous êtes 2, je vous recommanderais plutôt de partager une des spécialités et de chacun prendre un sandwich ou une salade. Si vous êtes en groupe, prenez chacun une spécialité différente pour pouvoir goûter à plusieurs variations et arômes différents. Je crois que ce serait le meilleur moyen de maximiser votre expérience au Birona! Pour le reste, les prix sont corrects et le décor est moderne et chaleureux. Petite attention amusante: une fois votre repas terminé, le personnel viendra vous apporter une gomme à mâcher. Birona est un bel ajout au Mile-End!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service, the server sat down with us and gave us an in-depth description of the menu and served us complimentary energy balls!"}
{"text":"Something called a Hummus Bar definitely caught my attention. And at a walking distance from the office, I had the perfect excuse to try it out for lunch.

The décor is cute, albeit somewhat cold, but it may have been due to the fact the restaurant was almost empty of customers. I guess most customers order take-out for lunch, which I did. Service was pretty slow, considering most (all?) of the order is precooked. It took a good 15 minutes to get my order.

I took Le Marocain, which is traditional hummus topped with minced beef, almonds, a sweet & spicy touch and some harissa. The hummus was decent, not as creamy as I normally like it. The topping was great, flavourful and what I believe to be homemade harissa was at the right level of heat.

It came with a side of grilled pita, which was thick and dense. Very good. It also came with a side of vinegar slaw which, unfortunately, was pretty bland and uninteresting.

In terms of price, I thought it was, overall, pretty expensive at $14. Not that the portion was too small, it was more than sufficient for lunch, but hummus is not exactly the most expensive thing to cook, neither is vinegar slaw and the very small amount of minced meat does not justify this price. I know rent on Saint-Laurent can be expensive, but I still feel this is too expensive for what it is, compared to what's available in the area for the same price level. At $10-11, I might have gone back. At $14, I'm not sure I will, which is unfortunate because overall, the food was good."}
{"text":"Simple mais savoureux, bon service malgré le rush, j'aime la saveur variés des exellents hummus, belle décoration mais je trouve qu'il manque plus de tables."}
{"text":"Great hummus with lots of yummy varieties. Highly recommended for a healthy and filling lunch."}
