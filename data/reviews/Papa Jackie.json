{"text":"Love this restaurant! Awesome food, quick service and affordable. If you go in a group it's even better. Don't hesitate to ask questions about the menu, there's always something else that's not on it. All in all it's the perfect place to enjoy great food in a casual place."}
{"text":"Went to Papa Jackie's for a Sunday lunch with Chinese friends who ordered for all. I saw it as a good sign that the restaurant was full and the only non-Chinese patrons were my date and me. Every single dish we had was either very good or fantastic. All the dishes came from the menu on the blackboard  that are not on the regular menu. Unfortunately only written in Chinese.  Ask your waiter to translate. These dishes are the house specialies of Cantonese cuisine. We ate the - Chinese broccoli - Lobster congee (with a whole lobster cut in pieces cooked in the congee) - Rolled rice noodles (ChangFen) - Fried gluten sticks (YuTiao) - Roasted/fried pork hock (fantastic) - Fried pork ribs (very good) - Chow Mein with calamari, scallops and vegetables (very good) - Custard balls (fantastic) Everything was perfectly cooked. You can tell the ingredients are very fresh.  Service was perfectly paced and the waiting staff very friendly. This is some of the best Chinese food I have had in and around Montreal. Definitely worth crossing the bridge. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because their specials menu is not translated which always makes me feel, as someone who doesn't read Chinese, like they keep their best stuff for their compatriotes. Also I haven't sampled enough of their menu yet."}
{"text":"It's actually closed for good! You better put some information on the website dear owner or whatever......"}
{"text":"Small little place for some good Chinese food! Affordable and a good variety of meals available!"}
{"text":"Food is the main and only reason for returning to this restaurant. It is located in south shore, thus quite far from home I will definitely return with big groups."}
{"text":"The wait is over, Papa Jackies is back in business! And now double the area! And has decor instead of looking super plain!  But most importantly, the food is the same as ever - delicious Chinese food!  I am very fortunate to have made many a visit to Papa Jackies with a dear friend who was able to guide us through the many many choices.  I can now walk in confidently and order my beloved salt and pepper pork chops, amongst other choices, and know I'm going to be oh so satisfied.  On our most recent visit we went at lunch on a Friday, and the place really filled up!  Especially on weekends and evenings, you definitely want to make a reservation.  Also good to know: they are bring your wine!"}
{"text":"Never got service this bad at a restaurant! Made a reservation and showed up on time. It took 20 minutes before anyone would even talk to us and we had to run after them to get their attention. They told us they had too many reservations and we'd have to wait with everyone and were completely unapologetic about it. Saw other groups that had reservations get turned away too. We decided to leave after learning they would not honour our reservation. Not sure if this is new management after they renovated but it's an absolute mess."}
{"text":"The service is bad. The only good thing is that the server greeted us , verified our reservation and seated us. When we were ready to order they just ignored us we were waiving hand and still no one came to our table. I wonder who take the tip for this bad service ... After eating what we first ordered  I wanted to make a second order because I was not full yet. Again, no one came to the table. So, my bf went to see a server to tell him we wanted to order again and he just coldly say that if we order now it is going to take a lot of time. Because of his attitude I instantly felt like the server didn't want us to order again. We still had like 1 hour 30 min in our reservation.  No food pic to share. The bird nest is smaller than any other chinese restaurant. The pork plate portion was also small. The taste was nothing more special than the other Chinese restaurant."}

{"text":"After hearing so many good reviews from people and reading my sister's article on MTL blog, we decided to have a family dinner there. I was very disappointed with the meal.  The food was good, but not great. For an Asian restaurant, I find that it's a little bit expensive. Service was good, the place was clean and waiters were nice. We ordered the duck, which was a 3 course meal. It was good, not greasy. The duck dish always comes with a veggie platter, but this restaurant switch it up  with fried rice and duck. It was different, and I actually liked the fried rice better than the veggie dish. We also ordered the fried lobster, which was very salty, as well as the beef with black bean sauce. It was good, but nothing special.  Over all, meal was tasty but not worth the hype. A bit pricey for Chinese food."}
{"text":"This is easily the best Chinese Restaurant on the South Shore of Montreal specializing in Mandarin Regional Cuisine. It's not cheap here, it's just good. Always ask what the specials are - they're written in Mandarin on the illuminated chalkboard. We had the B. C. Crab - it was to die for.  The chef took it right from the tank!"}
{"text":"It is now closed and almost demolished.  On the up side plenty of space to sit!  However not such a great service sooo long we left without ordering."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food you'll get in south shore!The place is newly renovated. Food is so good and at a good price. If you have questions Waiters and waitresses take the time to explain you things even if they have trouble speaking (I respect that). There's a good variety of things, from beef,chicken seafood,noodles etc. The food isn't too oily,which is a plus considering other asian restaurants usually make things with a lot of oil.  I brought some picky eaters here and they loved it! Doesn't compare to other asian restaurants, even if it's a little more expensive. IMO I would rather pay a little more (5-10$) and have good quality food, than pay cheaper and have an ok meal or a meal that send me to the washroom.   Bathrooms were also clean, with an automatic soap and paper dispenser.    If you love duck the 3 service is definitely something you need to try! Definitely try their seafood too!!  CON: Not many parking spots and the place gets packed fast."}
{"text":"I craved Chinese food and as we are having some reno in the kitchen I looked around for a local Chinese resto or takeaway. I had seen mixed reviews on Papa Jackie and passed it by with the intention of heading to another place. My wife having posted for recommendations threw up Papa Jackie also. I am not exaggerating when I say the worst Chinese food I have ever tasted. We arrived with the place almost empty and only one other table occupied. No matter to the bored and disinterested waiters who equalled the customer 1-1 we waited several minutes for a menu. Ok so maybe just a small gripe and after all the decor is really nice since they re opened so surely the food would match. WRONG ,  bland bland bland. We took the waitress's, (yes the original bored disinterested waiter went back to being bored and disinterested) suggestion of a fixed menu for 2 soup, spring rolls and 3 mains with rice. Mains were shrimp/cashew with vegetables, Chow Mien (chicken/shrimp) and a pepper beef.  so starter of 4 bland won tons in dish water, 4 frozen spring rolls to share with PACKET sweet sour sachet, small bowl of rice each (even the waitress muttered about it might be small portions but tasty) WRONG ... bland bland bland.  Pepper beef was only dish with any taste (4 out of 10) but tough. Chow Mien very little taste apart from the noodles. Shrimp and cashew was mainly Carrots and Celery and zero taste ( I doused mine with sweet n sour sachet sauce) Oh and no offer of water, just some Chinese tea initially which did have slightly more taste than most of what was served up. To be honest I was happy to get out of there and save any hassle gave a low tip rather than NONE as I wanted.  My view .. go anywhere else for chinese food as I doubt another establishment could do worse if they tried or stay at home and make your own using a IGA VH jar sauce !"}
{"text":"I gave a 4 stars, but I'd rate it more as a 3.5.  They just renovated, so the restaurant is more spacious and modern looking. Food wise, they introduced seafood combos consisting of big lobster and crab and they would make many dishes out of them ($$$).  I'd say, it's the place to go if you wanna have the seafood meals since there are not many restaurants here that offers it. If not, the other dishes are pretty similar to other Chinese restaurants. Also, maybe a tad more expensive here. Lunch time there is pretty good too, they have some special price items.  It tends to get very crowded, so it'll be safer to reserve in advance. The night I went, there was no more parking spot in the lot..."}
{"text":"I went there for a large friends and family gathering. The newly renovated restaurant offered good service and the entire place was clean. I recommend ordering the restaurants specialties (ask the waiter) as the other plates are good but not different from the other Chinese restaurants in the south shore."}
{"text":"Friendly service, food is average . Their Hong Kong style ice milk tea is good as well as their mammy seafood fried rice."}
{"text":"Just got back from my first visit and, after hearing from all my Chinese friends about how good it was, it did not disappoint. We were 7 people and shared an assortment of dishes: beef soup, whole chicken, sauteed beef with mushroom, whole lobster, whole fish in sweet and sour sauce, seafood on crispy noodles, large fresh scallop with garlic and ginger, and sweet tofu at the end. Everything was delicious and well presented. The service was very good and the restaurant itself is pretty clean and organized. Definitely the best Chinese restaurant in the Montreal area."}
{"text":"This is a family eatery that serves up savory and authentic Chinese food. As someone spoilt by the rich offerings of Chinese dishes in  Asia, I came away highly satisfied today. In fact, you can probably guess from the almost exclusively Chinese / Asian diners that Papa Jackies hit the spot.   There is an extensive menu that runs to several pages. We tried the more standard fare such as orange beef, dry noodles and porridge - all delicious!  In addition, there are some dishes with unique names that we've yet to try. We will be back!  The place is new and clean, and the food are reasonably priced.   Service is fast. Waitresses are knowledgable about the menu and help to make recommendations. (However typical of such eateries, one does not normally expect the waitresses to make enquiries to diners about whether everything was ok etc.)"}
{"text":"best place to eat Chinese foods with family/ friends for gathering. I love there service and food!!"}
{"text":"Home style Chinese joint that would still be open when most other places are closed. Place is clean, service is quick, attentive. For Montreal standards, the taste is great."}
{"text":"Stopped by and found out that Papa Jackie has gone through a big transformation: almost double the space as before, completely new and nice decor, and the same good enjoyable food and more (with a new menu)."}
{"text":"This a quick review on this chinese restaurant in Brossard, i tried this place few years ago but i want to give it another shot and i was surprised that they have renovated and the place looks better. It was for a early lunch and it was already crowded with alot asian people which is always a good sign, even if i am asian. So my wife and i only ordered 2 dished: special papa jackie seafood fried rice and the sizzling beef. Both plates were very goood!  The fried rice is packed with seafood and the presentation is nice, in a mini wood barrel. The beef was savory and tender, the sauce combine with the rice...perfect match! My only thumbs down is that it is a on the pricey side and the portion on the too little for a chinese place but the quality is there and i have to give them a big thumb up for that!  Next time we will come with family and try more dishes so i will update my review! Go eat there :)"}
{"text":"For those that are looking for a classic and authentic Cantonese food joint, look no further! This location would definitely suit your taste buds.   I went here on several occasions for lunch and after noon tea break and they have very reasonable prices. I have tried their wonton noodles and it is amazing. Comes with an abundant amount of wontons, noodles and vegetable. The broth of their wonton is one of the best I have ever had. A steal price of $6.  I also had the beef fried rice there! It was a bit on the salty side but it was very tasty. It was around $10 - this could of been better.  The congee there which costs $5.50 all day is great. I had the preserved egg and pork congee! Comes in a big bowl with lots of egg and pork, along with ginger slices which makes the congee real tasty."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5. I have an analogy for the food. It's like watching a really really good B-movie on tv. You will like it. But it's a B-movie. Food was a bit too salty. I.e msg. But it's Chinese food. You have to expect it. (Msg isn't all that bad either) Waiting time at door: none Waiting time for food: a decent pace. Entree, main dishes, etc Service: 4/5. Don't come in with great expectation. It's basically, eat and get out. They'll give you what you need but don't ask things like \"was the chicken treated in a humane manner and fed with organic hand picked ...\" Get outta here! Overall, 4/5 ign"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Very unique flavor and dishes. The special dishes are kind of small and pricy.  But some is worth it.  But the restaurant is small. Always rush you out. Somewhat impolite waiters. I understand they are busy. But don't mock customer when they ask for water or something.    This place need to work on their management and attitude. Just because you're famous doesn't mean you have to lower the service standard.   Overall. A place to try. Probably won't be going back for a long time."}
{"text":"Modern and updated decor. This place is reminiscent of Vancouver/Toronto Cantonese authentic restaurants. We ordered the seafood menu and it was fantastic.  We had a large 5.5lbs lobster served 2 ways ( steamed & fried with garlic & scallions).  The sea bass was meaty  but flaky & moist.  The light soya sauce complemented the fish dish with the ginger & scallions.  We really enjoyed the fried rice and the chicken. The bok choi dish was a tad bit bland. Price is on point considering the fish & lobsters are fresh ( straight out of the tank). Service was friendly and very courteous."}
{"text":"As Chinese picky eater, this restaurant is really average. Small and plain interior, not really attractive for me to go back again. Their food is served quite slowly so we got a bit irritated. Apparently some really rich Chinese people are regular customers there, so they often have good seafood, but I just go with simple dishes and got disappointed."}
{"text":"my favorite chinese restaurant in montreal. lots of specialties u can't find in typical chinese restaurants. chinese style bimbimbap. sea food fried rice in a bicket. giant king crabs and lobsters mountain on special requests. don't come here to order sweet n sour n wonton soup ."}
{"text":"I am so delighted to have found this restaurant! This place allowed me to enjoys Cantonese/Szechuan  food without having to cross the bridge. It has the vibe of the restaurants in Chinatown. The staff is awesome and very helpful. Service is quick and efficient.   When looking at the menu, i noticed that they also have a Chinese only menu. I asked the waiter/waitress to explain it to me which they did without hesitation :) The waitress also told me that since they have over 100 items and most aren't necessary on the menu, to tell her what we were in the mood for and she would give us suggestions. Our meal made us very happy!!! We order a few items (description on our bill *photo inserted). Our favourite is hands down the sizzling beef with pepper sauce (for hubby) and the salt and pepper pork chops (for me). My husband thinks its a little bit salty but i thought it was just perfect. It's also not too greasy like most restaurants. Great food, good prices. This place is also BYOB. NICE!! Right? Will be coming back real soon. Oh ya... easy parking ;)"}
{"text":"The fact that a small portion of wontons was charged 11$ is out of this world. They might serve good good but trying to scam me for either a mistake on their part or something else is outrageous! I might not understand Chinese but I know when something isn't right. I counted 7 wontons when I got home. 7 for 11$!!! What the hell? Every time my family and I would come here, we would spend on average 500$ and yet they still want to make a few extra dollars by being dishonest? It's all about the principles guys. This is wrong... shame on you. I'm never coming back here and so is my family."}
