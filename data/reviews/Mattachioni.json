{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since it's in my neighbourhood. I came with a friend and we both ordered a pizza. We both agreed that the crust was completely tasteless. It was nothing special. 

Both of us had upset stomaches the rest of the night. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Another local business that's boosting the area and not just any restaurant either! We came here for lunch on a Saturday and were welcomed by the friendly server and seated promptly.

The restaurant is very rustic, exactly what one would expect from an authentic Italian restaurant. We couldn't focus on the menu with the heavenly sourdough loaves waiting to be purchased and focaccia so we told the waiter to place one of each on hold. We didn't want to chance it as people were flocking in and out! 

When we did order we settled on the margherita pizza and salmone panini. Wow, great flavours all across. The pizza was well done with a good chew on the crust and the salmone came on their rustic bread, so good! With a nice salad lightly dressed, overall a really good meal and the price was very good! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This simple looking grocery/restaurant is run by the same person who worked the yummy wood-fired pizza oven at Norman Hardie Estate out in Prince Edward County. We have been to his restaurant twice on the recommendation of the winery itself, and both times it was pizza and Norman Hardie wines. This pizza is my favourite in the city, and is the same style as Libretto - thin, scorched crust and simple, delicious toppings. The crust recipe is very important to this style of pie, and it is excellent here. Do not let the basic layout of the space fool you. This is excellent food!"}
{"text":"We were in the junction and looking for a lunch place. Found this little Italian GEM. Service was excellent, Pizza and Salad were to die for. Definitely an excellent family owned business."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, but have yet to try the sourdough. The olives on the Napoli were super tasty, and there were just enough anchovies to give a salty kick. In authentic Italian style, served uncut. The sharp knives are very easy to use (for those who are surprised by the round pie).

The negroni was good - but it's also a hard one to mess up.
The service, on the other hand.....needs to be more attentive to timing. It was very friendly but slow."}
{"text":"Ordered the Margherita pizza, came burnt on the bottom, beyond normal burning. Got the lasagna for myself, cold in the middle. Not coming back.

And the waitress is a bit of a tool.

The wine was good, but somebody else made it."}
{"text":"Can't get enough. Loved the food, the service and the atmosphere.
The porchetta panini seemed purposefully simple so, in every bite, one could appreciate the quality of the homemade ciabatta and the tenderness of the slow roasted pork. I was delighted by the crunch of the rind in my very first bite. It felt like, when you have the best bread and freshly roasted meat, why lose the focus on anything else?
The mortadella panini was a complete suprise. I thought I loved focaccia before, but holy crow, now I know, I was missing out. I had no idea focaccia could be so soft and light. And although I'm not a mortadella fan (hubby is) I would order this panini a thousand times just to experience its smooth flavour and texture. The combination of fresh mozzarella with that amazing tomato focaccia made a simple sliced cold-cut meat into melt-in-your-mouth perfection. I can't wait to try the pizza."}
{"text":"This place actually has the best sourdough bread. No question. And their pizza is a real experience. Can't get enough, totally worth checking out. Call first if you're going up to grab bread, they sell out fast some days... it's that good."}
{"text":"This place is very close to my work, and I heard good things about this place from my colleague, so I decided to give it a try a couple weeks ago. I had one of their 'special' pizzas (Napoli) that you can get for $10 from Monday to Wednesday.

I called in for a take out, and they told me that it would take only about 10 minutes to be prepared. I was skeptical as a lot of places take much more time than they tell you initially when you place an order over the phone. I got there anyways in 10 minutes. Decor of the place was very cute and cheerful, and I was surprised to learn that my pizza was already packed in a box. The staff I dealt was very nice and pleasant.

When I opened the box at work, I was really happy to see that they didn't go cheap on the ingredients on top. Also, it was still super warm as it was fresh out of pizza oven, and mostly importantly, it smelled amazing. 

I was impressed by the fact that what I was tasting was only $10. If you enjoy eating fresh gourmet pizza, you definitely want to try this place! It's reasonably priced even without the Monday to Wednesday special, and mostly importantly, they know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Amazing pizzas, nicest staff. Also the sourdough bread they sell is ludicrously soft and delicious (worth the $8 or whatever they're charging). This place is like the platonic ideal of a perfect neighbourhood restaurant -- you can sit and split a bunch of pizzas and wine with a crew, or get a coffee or a sandwich to go, or even just buy their homemade pepper sauce and a dozen eggs. Their tomato focaccia is my favourite Saturday snack and they do a sandwich with that stuffed with mortadella that is unreal. Did I already say the staff are so friendly? Love this place."}
{"text":"The first time I tried their sourdough and I fell in love with it right away. Came back like 5 times and none of the experience was disappointing!!"}
{"text":"We came to try the sourdough as the reviews were good.  Though it's a bit expensive, I realized why when I got there: they're big.  We usually buy from De La Terre from the farmers markets, but in the winter, the Junction Market is gone.  Ultimately, their sourdough is very good, and rivals De La Terre.  Which is better?  They're just different.  De La Terre has the advantage of variety while Mattachioni is available regularly.

Delightful surprises:
1. Sandwiches.  We ended up taking some sandwiches to go, and man, some of the better sandwiches I've had in a long time.  Because sandwiches are so often done poorly, I don't like sandwiches.  I could keep coming back for these.  The Caprese used Kumato tomatoes!

2. Speaking of the tomatoes, Mattachioni has a little market setup along with a fridge for those needing to top up on anything, along with their sauces, etc.  From the looks of it, they use quality ingredients & produce that are fresh with vibrant colours.

Last, but not least, the owner there was super nice.  When I got there and had to make a call asking my wife what sandwiches she wanted, he offered me a glass of water, a table to sit, to enjoy and relax in the establishment.  We had a good chat about the place and the food they have, and next time, I hope to try a pizza."}
{"text":"People like Nidhi M. are the reason online reviews must always be taken with a grain of salt. Worst order ever? Really? Doesn't like his Orangina the fact that the pizza isn't cut and therefore tries to undermine a new business? Shameful."}
{"text":"Few things but carefully selected. 

Haven't tried the sandwich but they look they know what they're doing. 

Home made bread, pastries and tiramisu. 

3 stars for now because I haven't tried yet their sandwiches that look yummy but that's just it. Next time I'll try some and will let you know."}
{"text":"Walking down Dupont Street, you may get a whiff of fresh bread turn and see a sign -- a red M.  I suggest you change your plan,  push open the door and step inside this unassuming, almost whispering space.  Inside you will find such personable people -- serving up some of the most killer bread and sublime sourdough pizza in the city.    My faves:  Boccadasse pizza, Honey-Pecan Sourdough Bread, Salmon w Greens and the Caupone."}
{"text":"Their bread is really good but overpriced. Pizza we ordered was burnt on the bottom and was very small for the price. We haven't had the best experiences with customer service there. Service is inconsistent for the most part. What bothers me the most is this place has a very musty smell, often smelling of stale cigarette smoke. I wouldn't consider dining in here and only come in occasionally when I'm desperate for bread.  Their bread really is tasty so it gets an extra star for that. 3 stars!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza in the area. I would rate it top 3 pizza places in Toronto for Neopolitan style pizza. Everything was fresh, service was top notch and family friendly. I haven't had everything on the menu, but what I did have was delicious! The pepperocini is a must have! Not spicy, but filled with flavour. This is my new \"go to\" pizza place."}
{"text":"I don't like giving low scores but I've visited Mattachioni twice since moving to Dovercourt-Emerson and it has disappointed both times. Full disclosure, we ordered take out both times but service was cold each visit. Without boring you with details, the quality was average for a premium price. The portions are also tiny. Do yourself a favour and head to Defina down the street instead."}
{"text":"Awesome place. A new gem in the neighborhood. Exceptional paninis and pizzas - fresh, light and delicious."}
{"text":"Our second time to this place and walking distance. Pizza was awesome, service good...please though make sure the dishes are clean. All the glasses brought to us were dirty. Perhaps a new dishwasher...it is just off-putting a little. Also attention to cleanliness is something super simple that any resteraunt can pay attention too...not just the tables and dishes, window sills, floors and handles...doesn't cost much...just a little work and the result will be happy customers who come back. We will be back and hope it is better...and a little cleaner all around!"}
{"text":"Came back to try the pizza and had the mortadella again and can't say enough good things about it! I think I will become a regular here."}
{"text":"So one day I walk in to this place, because I can see it's changed up owners. Bread! Awesome. I buy half a loaf--for $5! What? I go home and eat it. It was amazing, but who wants to spend that much cash on Sourdough? Paris Bakery also sells amazing bread for like a 1/3rd the price. Anyway, I go back, and buy a whole loaf for $8. It's so fucking good. I've done this so many times now.

Hey look. They have home made chilli oil--for like $7-8. That seems excessive. It tastes amazing, though. I am pretty addicted to it now. I've got three packs of the stuff in my fridge right now. It's so good.

Anyway, i'm talking about the place like they are just a corner store. They make pizza and sandwiches as well. I haven't had a sandwich yet, but they look legit. The pizza's are great. They are up there with Queen Margarita & Libretto. If you like that sort of pizza you can't go wrong. This is easily the best pizza in the area."}
{"text":"Best focaccia ever ! 
Also, the most delicious sandwiches in town. Honestly. Mattachioni does it right"}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've ever had. The salt was uneven, the pizza wasn't cut, very amateurish. I feel like a 10 year old made this."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. The salads are crazy fresh. The charcuterie are awesome with much of their meats cured in-house. The breads are all baked in a wood oven, purpose build by a master mason. The kitchen is a bakery! And the pizzas are killer. Baked to absolute perfection with incredibly fresh toppings. When other Junction restaurants talk up this place, you know it's worth trying. 

* A side note to Nidhi M., stick with Pizza Pizza. They cut their pizza and deliver Coke in 2L bottles."}
{"text":"I had a pretty nice meal here last night. We both had vegetarian pizzas (pretty good) and the olive appetizer (just OK). The service seemed a bit rushed (the pizza came out two minutes after the appetizers) so I'd say that the ambience was lacking."}
{"text":"Nothing but kind words for this place. We live around the corner so have frequented plenty of times. Amazing tiramisu, awesome pizza (ask for extra chili sauce on the side), perfect (and I mean PERFECT) take away sourdough. They carry a few Italian groceries. Oh man the mushroom salad. Insane. Honestly. So so worth it. They have mon-wed pizza specials and cheap wine all the time!"}
{"text":"Excellent handmade authentic pizzas, better than Queen Margarita & Libretto! The dough is what makes the difference - it's perfectly balanced between crispy and chewy. The porchetta sandwich was OK. It was good prochetta, but one-dimensional. We prefer the ones at Porchetta & Co. because of the extra fixings we can get on it. The atmosphere is laid-back - a homey Italian cafe. It is very kid-friendly, and most tables around us had come with their kids."}
{"text":"Casual, relaxed and yet an upscale dining experience. 
The food is top notch. The company cocktails are great. The service is good. The problem cars are good. It won't win for its ambiance or atmosphere (if you're looking for intimacy) but it's not trying to either. You can buy tomatoes, cheese, fresh bread, and pickled goods here too. It's authentic and they put their food in front of it all."}
