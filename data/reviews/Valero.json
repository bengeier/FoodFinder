{"text":"Hmmm, what can I say about a gas station chain.......well this location is right after the Canadian border which is good if you waited to refuel at almost a dollar a gallon less a gallon than our neighbors north. This location also has a D&D and convenience mart on the property so you can kill a couple birds with one stone. It's A-OK bro."}
{"text":"Beware! Just filled up the tank, car started shaking like crazy. Got to a Toyota service center, who told us we had a bad tank of gas."}
{"text":"One of the last gas stops before hitting Canada (or your first coming back state side).   Offers a Dunkin Donuts and a Papa Johns alongside the convenient store if you've got a munchkin craving that can't be satisfied with lame munchkin imitations, this is the place to stop!"}
