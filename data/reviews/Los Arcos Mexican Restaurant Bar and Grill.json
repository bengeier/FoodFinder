{"text":"I dig this place-cheap, fast, good food and good margaritas. The staff is friendly and I have a nice time whenever I go here."}
{"text":"Ordered tacos a la carte for lunch. Maybe I was confused but read a Cleveland article that their tacos were delicious and they had 8 kinds of meat including tongue.  Server indicates only two types of meat are available, ground beef and chicken. Ordered the chicken, they arrived and it was a boiled solid third of chicken breast in each taco with iceberg lettuce on top and some cheese. Absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Worst experience in a restaurant as a Chef working in the industry myself. Brought in my family of 8 and was told to wait then all of a sudden sat immediately missing 2 chairs so we had to push chairs together to sit and were sat without silverware. Was never introduced to our server and had a server after 30 minutes ask us if we had been greeted and we replied no. They kindly took our drink order and got us our drinks and chips and salsa but forgot my 6 year old niece's drink and sat without a drink for at 30 minutes. After waiting again for 45 minutes again we were asked if we had been helped and again we replied no. A gentleman again kindly took our food orders and told us he would put it in right away. Another 45 minutes or so went by and again nothing. Other tables that had arrived before us received their meals at a reasonable time. The hostess was the only one that seemed to care. Never saw or talked to a manager or owner the entire experience. Our experience was just short of 2.5 hours without any food and no communication. Horrible experience. I will make sure that my family and anyone I know does not go to this restaurant. Horrible management and communication between staff."}
{"text":"Overall our experience was very good. Even though it was prime dinnertime on a Saturday evening the service was excellent. We ordered an app of queso fundido . It was a very runny cheese sauce with a few pieces of chorizo thrown in. I also ordered Chiccarones wich I was very excited about. The pork was very tender and flavorful but I was expecting cracklings and got soggy pieces of skin. Other than that  it was a good dinner and we would probably give it another try."}
{"text":"Just moved here from Texas and this is the best Mexican food I've ever had!! The margaritas are dangerous lol"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding, and the service went above and beyond. The restaurant was jammed, but they brought our food out quickly and checked in on us regularly. There were four of us. One had vegetarian, one chicken, one beef, and one a combination of things served in a beautiful carved out pineapple.  We each loved our meal."}
{"text":"Friendly service, two gentlemen walked by to check on us, our server got our order right & brought us what we requested, no problem.  I like that they bring extra napkins so you don't have to ask & all of the hot sauce is already on the table.  The seat & menu had food & salsa on them so I wiped it off.   Salsa & Chips were blah.  I used a tasty sauce on the table to flavor it up a bit.  We ordered the Burrito Fajita & to taste a bit of everything, the El Grande Special.  Rice & beans & ground beef taco were blah.  You'd think that w/ cheese, sour cream & hot sauce that would compliment the flavors, but it didn't.  The grilled beef strips in my Burrito Fajita were half chewy & only half was covered w/ cheese.  I've had better.    The margaritas w/ ice & salt were delish!"}
{"text":"Great service, awesome margaritas, and amazing food! Best Mexican restaurant in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute bomb!  Great food. Outstanding people. The seem to take great pride in recognizing their regular customers since they seem to greet nearly everyone like a friend. Los Arcos replaced an existing Mexican restaurant that was not nearly as good. If you're a fan of gorditas, mark your calendar for Sunday.  If you're not already a regular here, you will be!"}
{"text":"If you have been to Erie then you have probably heard of 'El Canelo'. Well Los Arcos is it's big cousin. Very similiar feel to the place. Friendly hostess, friendly waiter. Food is average. I ordered the enchilada supreme and my wife ordered the same thing she gets at El Canelo which is a couple tacos and burritos w cheese sauce on top. This place has nothing incredible about it but certainly well priced, homey atmosphere and decent food. A solid, simple choice."}
{"text":"I'm giving it a 1 star because the guacamole was very good. Other than that the service was TERRIBLE! We've never waited @ a Mexican restaurant for as long as we did for our food. We order very specific & when they brought it out it was all wrong. Oh' & the portions are very skimpy. Find somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"We stopped in after shopping and I'm glad we did!! I got enchiladas (pollo) and they were so good!!! My friend had some dish (I didn't get the name) and it was delicious looking. Service was super quick and we'll be back"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this exact restaurant for 15 years.  The menu is authentic and the staff couldn't be more friendly.  there are daily specials that are to die for!  Salsa made fresh daily, along with a new recipe for rice?  It's so dang good!  It is our favorite restaurant hands down!!!"}
{"text":"Good Tex Mex end even some Mex Mex.  Went for Cinco de Mayo, so the service wasn't the best.  I had a veggie enchilada, very bland, don't get it!  I would go back again as the menu looked interesting.  Good chips and salsa."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Los Arcos is just your typical Mexican restaurant. Addictive chips and salsa, margs, and some great tacos, rellenos, and fajitas to boot!   The one thing that sets them apart for me though is their Thursday night trivia! I went with a group of about 7 people one Thursday night and we had an absolute blast! It was highly interactive, fun, and just the right amount of difficulty. The younger man running the trivia night was entertaining and facilitated a wonderful game  I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Large portions, very good food and great margaritas!  Any of the specials that you can share are excellent. Always have leftovers."}
{"text":"First visit to Los Arcos and definitely not my last!  I visited on a busy Friday evening, waiting just a few minutes for a table.  The staff could not have been any nicer, very refreshing.  My friends and I sat and began to review the menu.  We started with a pitcher of strawberry margaritas, guacamole (very tasty and cheap at $3.50 compared to other places), and the complimentary chips and salsa.  I ordered the Fajitas Texjanas, shrimp, steak and chicken with lots of fresh veggies, including mushrooms and broccoli...yum!  The entree arrived just a short time later, hot, fresh and delicious.  The portion was HUGE, accompanied by rice, refried beans, more guac, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes and warm tortillas.  Everything was just perfect, seasoned appropriately.  There was so much, I took the remainder home and re-heated for dinner the next day.  My dining companions enjoyed their meals, as well.  I will absolutely return to Los Arcos!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant around! The prices are low and the food is great! My favorite thing about this restaurant is the low cost of the generously sized margaritas. Sometimes it does take a while to get seated, but it's really worth the wait. This weekend I had the Burrito Chipotle and was surprised and the portions given."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the best Mexican street food on the east side of Cleveland.  I have been searching for this type of authentic Mexican food for years.  My personal favorite is the Torta which is not even on the menu.  I have sampled both the hard and soft tacos during the taco Tuesday special and they are both done well.  The salsa is to die for, smooth and just a little spicy from the fresh jalape√±o peppers that are finely chopped into the mix.  The service for takeout has been prompt with a call ahead order and you even get a bag of chips and a nice serving of the salsa as a bonus with the order.  Muy Bueno!"}
{"text":"It's what I expected. Good Americanized Mexican food. I had the Carnitas dinner. VERY tasty. Moist but not too fatty. Like other reviewers noted it's pretty plain but that's ok. If you're looking for a more authentic experience there are other places. If you want to feed the family while you suck  down a beer or a margarita this is the place. Friendly prompt service too."}
{"text":"New name, new decor, new owner, (mostly) same friendly staff and yummy food! My husband and I dined regularly at Don Tequila and will continue to do so at Los Arcos. The new bar area is a nice addition and the new booths are more comfortable than the old ones. The food seems slightly improved and the chips are noticeably fresher. My only complaint is that the dine in side order of rice seems to have shrunken in size dramatically, but it's still the same price. The to go serving size is still very generous, though. So glad to have a decent Mexican spot on the East side again."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food, drinks, ambiance and owners/wait staff. Cannot say enough, must try and you will be back!"}
{"text":"Americanized Mexican food, but a very solid iteration of it.  I was in the mood for tacos one night last weekend, and our normal delivery place wasn't taking orders, so we gave Los Arcos a shot.  I'm glad we did, because it turned out to be a great choice!  Their queso fundido isn't anything extraordinary, but it's tasty, and you can't complain much about cheese dip with sausage, can you?  I had the chile rellenos and they were great.  To try as much of the menu as possible, my husband tried the \"especial grande.\"  For only $12.99, this consisted of: chalupa, chile relleno, beef taco, beef enchilada, beef burrito, rice, and beans.  Leftovers for days!  Most of it was really good, too.  You can't beat the price point, and you can get delivery on SkipTheDishes super easily, so I'm sure we'll be repeat customers."}
{"text":"I've been to Los arcos enough to give it a fair review. Been coming for a few years now and the servers know me by name. This an Americanized version of a Mexican restaurant and most of the plates come with, as you probably guessed, rice and beans. The menu is very extensive covering everything from burritos, to tacos, enchildas, tamales and so on. The chili replenish are great! I have a personal liking to the platters.  The combination plates generally run about 10-12 bucks and you can mix and match. I like the  The pitcher of margaritas is generally a good deal as you can get about 4 margaritas out of a pitcher. The salsa is very good. There is plenty of parking and usually there is not much of a wait for a table. Service is usually good to about average with employees and friends of employees getting most of the attention. Dinners do come out pretty fast. As a bonus, this is one of the better Mexican places in the area."}
{"text":"New name and new look (maybe new ownership or management?) but same great food! My husband and I loved our dinner tonight and the service and atmosphere were great! We really liked the remodel, very bright and light. The new bar area is cool, too. We will definitely continue to be regulars. Only Mexican restaurant on the east side that we love since we moved here 3 years ago!"}
{"text":"We went to this place for my birthday.. We live in California but were visiting family here in Cleveland.. Being from California we know good Mexican Food.. This place scored high.. Great margaritas.. Amazing carnitas, for sure the best I've had in a long time.. My daughter had the chipotle burrito with steak and chicken and loved it.. My son loved his kids plate, too.. Good chips and salsa. Friendly service.. We will be back.. Thanks for a great birthday dinner.."}
{"text":"A very nice local Mexican Restaurant.  Stopped by for lunch since it is nearby and I will say it is better than expected.  Nestled in a small strip on Green Road, you find a nice clean place with carved wooden booths.  Hung on the walls is various pieces of ethnic clothing, at least it is something different.  The chips were thin and fresh, the salsa was OK, but lacked any heat, so I mixed in some hot sauce and it worked just fine.  I ordered the #10 lunch combination: Chile Relleno, bean chalupa and rice.  The Relleno was good, just enough heat in the pepper, stuffed with a mild white cheese and deep fried.  The chalupa was decent with a big dollop of guacamole on top.  The Mexican rice was flavorful and well prepared.  Overall the food is good, although overall lacking a bit in spiciness.  A nice place to get some traditional style Mexican American food.   You will not be getting anything that is very innovative or new, but you will get a good solid meal."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. I'm from New Jersey and I came to Ohio to with my boyfriend to visit his friend. I got the authentic Mexican steak tacos and he got the arroz con pollo. We also got the queso fundido as an appetizer which is amazing! The arroz con pollo actually comes with the cheese sauce drizzled over it. The bar owner is really nice and welcoming. Definitely a place I will go back to whenever I come back to Ohio."}
{"text":"I really like this place. They do some things very well and the owners are cool as feck. Great to have a place like this so close."}
{"text":"The service was good. The food was okay but not the most flavorful. It was pretty basic Mexican food but bland. My potato burrito was cold on the inside. Their margs were good, but this is further from me than some other Mexican restaurants that are better. I think they could be better. I loved that they had so many options for vegetarians though. I would go here again, but I wouldn't pick it myself."}
{"text":"Very tasty meal.  Overall, I would consider this very Americanized Mexican food. There were a lot of spices that could have been used, instead they played it safe. Which is fine. Most Americans aren't used to real Mexican food,, or the spices used to created delicious dishes.   It was a good meal. Started with chips, salsa and Guacamole. Also a pineapple Jarittos which are my favorite.  We ordered our meals. We had chicken and steak fajitas. The refried beans were wonderful and everything came out hit and ready to eat. We devoured it.   We then ordered a margarita and a steak wrap. It had power behind it. The grilled veggies, cheese and steak were a perfect combination.   The restaurant sits in a small strip mall with other restaurants. It was well lit, but it was a bit crowded. More like a zoo. Lol!  Great evening and the prices were awesome. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Ok so I am a Mexican food snob. Just Boomeranged back to CLE after living in SoCal for the last 28 years. I enjoyed everything from the dives to the high end Mexican in SoCal. It's been my mission to try and find a place in Cleveland that could stand with a SoCal Mexican restaurant, these guys are in the ballpark. First the chips house made came out warm with the perfect amount of salt, the salsa was tasty. The Texas margarita, WOW, you better like Tequila. I do and it was very good. I always order chicken enchiladas when I first try a place, it's basic, but if they can't get this right then it's generally down hill from there. They got it very right, the chicken was chunks of breast meat, the red sauce was good, and the tortillas fresh. My only grip is they need to up the spice/heat level with the salsa and even enchilada red sauce. But so far they are the winner."}
{"text":"Los Arcos is a fantastic restaurant, I have been here twice and each time I find it better and better. The food is very authentic, and the service is superb. The fajitas were very good which had chicken, shrimp and steak but I felt their wasn't as much meat to vegetables ratio which I was disappointed for,  but non the less it was very tasty and delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite for many years.  Their pork roast  dishes are excellent.  Beef burritos are great also. AND....Flan. mmmmmm flan!"}
{"text":"When we came into the restaurant the hostess and Waiter at register were dry almost reluctant to acknowledge us. Then he seated us got us some water but it took about five minutes before waiter came over to take our order. Waiter didn't look to motivated but once we gave our orders the food came back fast food. The food was good and waiter was good therefore i am giving them 3 Stars due the poor greeting."}
{"text":"Ok Mexican food. I ordered the Chori Pollo after having it at El Jalapeno on the Westside (which was soo good) I decided to try it here. Not even close. Very little chorizo the rice didn't have that much flavor but for the most part it was ok. Noting special. I did enjoy the chips that they give but the salsa was meh."}
{"text":"Really tasty Mexican food. We had the chorizo and carnitas tacos. The carnitas tacos were a tad dry but everything was very flavorful."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend, were grabbing our last dinner together while I'm here in Cleveland, this little restaurant was absolutely awesome. The food and drinks were great, the service was quick and fast. We were able to enjoy a peaceful little night to ourselves before going out separate ways. I had the beef and chicken burrito. I added a little bit of white queso and it was just fantastic. I enjoyed a corona-rita or whatever you call them things. This little cozy restaurant would def be one of my go to choices whenever I come back to Cleveland area. If your new to the area for vacation and want a good meal with friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere, this should be a restaurant on your list!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food I've tried in Ohio. Food is fresh and tasty. Their margaritas are fantastic!!Staff is very friendly and the portions are huge. This place is a must!"}
{"text":"So tasty!!  We stopped by for a couple margaritas and got food to go. The margaritas were good. Not too sweet. I got the especial grande which is basically a 3 course meal and I am currently 2 courses in and am super happy!  So glad that we heard of Los Arcos (from a friendly bartender - who swears by this place and goes there almost weekly) The food is good, the portions are great. We will be back! And soon."}
{"text":"Missing half the order in my delivery. When I called to ask for the rest of the food that I paid for, the owner pretty much told me to go screw. Do not order from this place."}
{"text":"My first visit my food and drinks were great. Tonight I ordered takeout and was extremely disappointed, wrong meat in my enchiladas, along with a thick 3 inch stem found inside. I examined my food before leaving, didn't think to rip the enchiladas open to see the type of meat inside. I called the restaurant, I was told \"that's what I thought you ordered and the stem won't harm you if eaten.\" I was also told, I could come back for a refund but only problem is I live over 20 mins away! My other order was perfect. It will be awhile before I decide to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is good, consistent and cheap.  We only ever had one issue with service but that was just a bad waiter.  The churros with ice cream for $3 is amazing and well worth it."}
{"text":"Los Arcos is my new go to spot for Mexican cuisine in Cleveland. Guac and salsa are very good as are the quesadillas. I ordered the Los Arcos burrito the last two times I ate there and it is amazing. Staff and service are top notch. I highly recommend Los Arcos!"}
{"text":"New restaurant in the neighborhood with a coupon to prompt us in: The place itself was very clean, spacious (so great for big groups). The bathrooms were very modern looking. Service was quick. Started off with fresh crispy tortilla chips. Salsa was a little bland, but they gave us something to spicy it up for our liking. Additionally, they also had chicharrones available which went great with our doctored salsa (a lot more filling than those chips).   Got the chicken enchilada entree: Refried beans were so bland, I think some salt or garlic would be a nice addition. Entr√©e itself was regular, nothing made it stand out.   Easy parking though in a shopping center. It was quite empty when we went in. I think Cozumel is a better option for your Mexican food craving"}
