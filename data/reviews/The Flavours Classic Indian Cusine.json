{"text":"Service was sub-par, the gentleman serving is seemed bored and lacked proper communication skills.

Food is what matters, unfortunately, the food wasn't impressive either. We had ordered 4 different types of curries, all lacking flavours, pun intended. All the curries were bland, not even seasoned properly with salt, which was mutually agreed upon by a group of 10.  

Considering the variety of good restaurants nearby, we did regret settling on this one."}
{"text":"Place is bit small but ambience is pretty good for the new restaurant.  As soon as we took the seat, we been told that main course will take around 20-30 min to prepare since they prepare for specific orders only as per customer taste, and we are okay with it since we were 6 of us and most of us are bit choosy!  This place offers veg/non-veg and alcoholic drinks which have many different varieties for veg and non-veg lovers.  They also have buffet till 3PM. 
Starters/Appetizers came in quick and by the time we are done main course arrived!

{"text":"This place cannot handle ANY party of over 5 people.

Tried to order for my office lunch party of 20 today. I called 1 hour ahead, but the server was very vague on the phone as to whether it would even happen. Finally she agreed, and said would call back. They never called back. When we called again to confirm 30 min later, another person answered and said we had to call the day before to order. He also claimed that we needed the food for 5pm, where 3 other coworkers of mine clearly heard me say 1pm.

On a side note, 2 months ago around 10 of my coworkers went there for lunch, and our orders were SEVERELY butchered. Sit down service was very sliw as well.

Do not go there if you need a quick lunch/have many people with you."}

I tried the butter chicken and it tastes better than most butter chicken."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely atrocious! The girl attending us was completely checked out. 

We waited for 20 minutes before we could order. People who came after us got attended to before. 

The girls kept vanishing from time to time with no one on the floor. 

At the end of it all, I asked for some dessert, remaining food for take away and the check. 20 minutes since no action. 

She kept clearing tables when the whole restaurant was empty. 

Finally, when the check arrived, she stood there while I packed the take away food without offering to do it. I asked her if she could help and she refused. 

Having waited for a living, I never leave anything lower than 15% tip. This time was an exception. 

Food is average. Nothing to write home about.

Spent nearly $100 but experience sucked."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food!  I love the fact that they deliver to your hotel room at the Toronto Pearson Airport.  I was on extended stay for business and this restaurant was one of a few that will deliver to your hotel.  Perfect when you want a change from the expensive hotel food. The food was hot and very tasty.  Delivery staff friendly.  Highly recommend.  See \"Just Eat\" for delivery option."}
{"text":"I have been to many Indian restaurants, and have had the privilege of enjoying authentic Indian cuisine many times in my life. I stumbled across The Flavours online when searching for top rated Indian restaurants in the GTA, so I decided to check them out rather than my usual go-to Indian places in the Brampton area on a Saturday night for dinner.

They share a large parking lot with a strip mall and a banquet hall, so on a Saturday night it was fairly busy, but still easy to access and find spots. The interior was very spacious, clean and modern looking with an open concept which is far different than the usual restaurants. There were only 3 or 4 other tables occupied when I arrived.

Being a Canadian born Italian, I get a variety of reactions when I enter authentic Indian restaurants. The staff member who greeted us was very polite and asked us if we needed help with the menu, which was a nice gesture considering we obviously were not culturally experienced. I declined and dug right into the choices.

They have a fair sized 6-7 page menu, counting drinks and all the before-and-after meal options. I immediately looked for some of the staple Indian dishes, as my company on this evening wasn't too familiar with Indian cuisine. So we got the Butter Chicken and Channa Masala, and I ordered the Palak Chicken for myself with Garlic Naan. We asked about the portion sizes, and was given an accurate sizing description. Typically I am used to over-sized portions and plenty of leftovers, so I wanted to ensure we weren't ordering enough food for an army. The waitress took our order on an iPad and let us know it would be 15-20 minutes to prepare.

The Channa Masala was excellent. Bang-on authentic and good to the last drop.

The Palak Chicken was also great. I was pleasantly surprised as this is a dish that varies in taste depending on where you get it.

The Garlic Naan was fresh and perfectly prepared.

The Butter Chicken was surprisingly disappointing. The chicken itself was cooked to my satisfaction, but something about the sauce was off. It tasted sweeter than I have experienced anywhere else, however my friend who was trying it for the first time loved it. However it was edible, although I greatly preferred the other items we had to choose from.

We left a small amount of Butter Chicken but finished the other dishes. We were asked if we wanted it to go, and declined, which got a shocked reaction from the staff. But once our dishes were cleared, we stayed and chatted for about 30 minutes and were constantly being brought water refills and asked if we wanted anything else.

The bill came out to $42 for two people and 4 items off the menu. We left highly satisfied, and I would definitely return to try some of the other dishes (as well as a reorder of the Channa, which was just perfect!)"}
{"text":"Great for takeout! I work nearby and they're pretty decent at having my order ready within 15-20 min. Their customer service needs a little work sometimes, but overall they're acceptable. I like having the option of an \"individual\" or regular size. Chicken vindaloo is good, nice spices to it. Love the daal tadka and the naan is very fresh and tasty. Pakoras are also top-notch. They never seem to be all that busy for such a large restaurant, but they do have good food. Will continue going and trying different items."}
{"text":"The drinks were decent their tandoori chicken was good but a little too much salt, we asked for spicy food the chicken kharahi was sweet the biryani was horrible no flavour"}
{"text":"Ordered with uber eats as there a promo for free delivery,

Butter chicken, 4/5 asked for spicey but it came sweet which I was sad about but no big deal

Aloo Gobi - 5/5 this was great veg augthentic and the veggies weren't soggy they were crisp and tasty 

Garlic Naan, 5/5 was fluffy and garlicky

Jeereza Rice - 2/5 was very good but for 5$ the portion wasn't even enough for one person this was very disappointing when it's just basic spiced rice

Will defiantly order again was very good Indian food"}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I've had. I came here 2 years ago and was pleasantly surprised to find this still operating. The restaurant was fairly dead, with my family and 2-3 others, but had great decor. The tandoori is some of the best you'll find, and we ended up getting 2 plates. The hariali chicken is unreal. The vegetables and naan was fantastic as well. Service was great, all very reasonably priced. This is just about as good as you'd get in India, I have been there several times."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, two of my colleagues, our manager, and I visited The Flavours for our Friday lunch. Our boss drove, which was a miracle!

We were promptly seated in a booth. My manager complained that it was too difficult for him to get in and out of it of his seat, so we went with a round table instead.

It's always nice to go out with one colleague in particular, who doesn't join us often. When she does, like she did here, I always learn so much about East Indian cuisine from her. I learned the difference between lamb and mutton, with the latter being goat. Lamb, to her, has a distinct aftertaste and avoids it.

I ordered the thali. It came with fish, salad, yogurt and mint sauces. I ordered garlic naan, rice and butter chicken, veggies, and chana masala. You get unlimited rice, veggies, and chana masala. Frankly, there was tons of food that I didn't go for seconds. My colleague did. It is such a good deal for lunch if you have a huge appetite.

I absolutely loved how yummy, fragrant, and fresh my food was. So delicious! I ate everything. The garlic naan was so good that I could have eaten it by itself!

My student loved her food, too. It was nice seeing her chow down. She was so happy!

My manager had no complains. He ordered butter chicken, too. We were all pleased with the tastiness of our meals.

Our server was helpful describing menu items. She was prompt with serving us our food and refilling our water jug. It was a perfect outing. 

I would definitely come back here.

{"text":"We've been coming here every week for over a month now so can say we know what we're talking about. I've tried a bunch of the Paneer dishes and they were all great. My friends swear that the Chicken Tikka Masala is excellent. Order Indian spicy if you like it hot!"}
