{"text":"This humble restaurant serves big meal & tasty food. Was surprised on our $15 main dish - chicken, beef, pork w/ guacamole & tacos (pls see pic). Me, my husband & my 3 yrs old son ended up sharing one main dish & one entree. The service is very good too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go to lunch on a very cold saturday afternoon; since we were in the area we pick Charro's. Really happy with our choice! Food was very tasty. Really enjoyed our meals! And just to warm us up we both had a shot of tequila ;) Was really a great afternoon & the staff was friendly and made us feel welcome! Doing some shopping on St Hubert? Pick Charros for a good casual eat!"}
{"text":"I was running late and needed a snack so this was perfect. Mom and Pop kinda place with the famjam in the kitchen (always key). I grabbed a pulled pork sandwich for $6 (I meant to order the 3 tortillas but saw $6 and just blurted out \"pulled pork\"). They gave me some chips and sauce to snack on while I waited, I can't quite call it salsa because it tasted like tomato sauce with a little flavor (looked that way too). My sandwich was like a sloppy joe but cut in half. Burger bun, tomato, lettuce, pulled pork, and -surpriiiiise- some perfectly ripe avocado. The sandwich was delicious, it was quick and (relatively) cheap and I'm happy to know a little spot to duck in for food around the St Hubert Plaza.  Why only 4 stars? The tomato sauce vs pasta concerned me about what some of their other flavor profiles might be. The service was decent but nothing memorable - and I can never have enough cilantro."}
{"text":"Ca fait la job, 3 tortillas mixte pour 6$ c'est honnete et ca bourre. En plus vous pouvez poigner un episode d'un teleroman mexicain ;)"}
