{"text":"If you go here you must try the fries they are the best. In my opinion this is the best gyro in CLE. The \"gyro guy\" is the best. It is a classic gyro, topped with chicken and fries. I eat here once a week and I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"It's hard to make a really good yearo (to spell it the way it is pronounced), because all but one of the ingredients come prepackaged. That lump of spiced beef and lamb comes from a commercial distributor. So, probably, did the pita bread.  This is why, if you're at a street fair, gyros are safe choices. Unless the meat was pre-cut and then left unrefrigerated to go bad), everyone pretty much uses the same stuff.  The only things you can do to make the food good are (1) select very high-quality lettuce, white onion and tomatoes at the wholesale market on E 55th and (2) make a good tzatziki (the cucumber, yogurt and garlic sauce).  Gyro Guys does both. One of the things that helps is that the owner runs a catering business after he closes at 7 PM. That's a cut-throat industry; pink, tasteless tomatoes (with unripened centers) and wilted lettuce will cost you a client. By getting the stuff for one business, they can use it in the day job.  It's why the potatoes and rings taste better-- he's using better product. The beer in the ring batter helps too, and they change the oil regularly. Rings (which are harder to get right) are better than the fries (I know 5-10 places as good).  The sauce has good product-- and it isn't jazzed up. They're not under the delusion that it should taste like Big Mac Sauce (as the overhyped place a few blocks north believes). It's SUPPOSED to be a little sharp, so it bites you a bit and highlights the meat. The yogurt isn't bland white stuff; you can taste the cucumber and the garlic   (The other review is right; it does use a lot. As Martha Stewart, the daughter of Satan likes to say, this is \"a GOOD thing\".)  Size on the colossus is good. I'm a big guy and it fills me up. Prices are reasonable, given the amount of food.   Can't say how the service is because I've never come in when they were slammed. Every time it's been really fast. But if there's one person in front of you and no one behind you ,how can you judge?  Never ordered any sandwich but the gyros, but I assume the other stuff is fine. The guy runs a catering business; I figure he knows how to make a turkey or tuna salad sandwich. ,   Docking one star because (1) traffic can be a hassle and street parking can be a little tough (best bet is the side street, but you can end up being pretty far down the block, (2) no fountain drinks (only cans and bottles), which means no ice on hot days and (3) all they got is baklava for dessert.  But if you need a gyro, this would definitely be the pace to go."}
{"text":"I am so glad to have this place near my house! This is where I feed my gyro cravings! Fresh meat and veggies made these Gyros so good and didn't hurt my belly like the ones they sell at stands downtown. The 2nd time I came here I recognized the owners from the neighborhood. They are brothers who were always hardworking and good people.  It makes the place even better!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Super fast, super tasty , super clean! We order at least once a week at work! They also deliver and do large orders! Very accommodating! Huge  selection on the menu. I am not a gyro fan but I enjoy their subs and chicken."}
{"text":"Just visiting from California. The Original Greek Gyro was delicious. Wish we had more places like this. Guy behind the counter was super friendly."}
{"text":"Nice people, nice interior and really yummy food. We are so glad to have Gyro Guys in Old Brooklyn!"}
{"text":"I have stopped in a couple times now. The staff have always been very friendly and welcoming. The food is real. Good fries, good gyros, etc. If you are looking for a gyro or quick bite, you just can't go wrong. Yes I am giving them 5 stars, cause they did exactly what they are supposed to do."}
{"text":"My favorite gyro joint in Northeast Ohio.  I have been there 6 times and I have only had gyros and fries so I can't attest to the quality of the rest of the menu.  Who cares?  If they make such a great gyro why try anything else??? I brought 5 friends there at different times and they all love it too.  Oh yeah, the baklava is terrific too ..."}
{"text":"Solid choice for a quick sandwich, if you are in to Gyro's.  Went here during lunchtime recently where they always seem to have some kind of (well priced) special going.  Ordered a Gyro with fries and my buddy ordered a Gryo with onion rings.  Sandwiches were delivered to the table and were bursting at the seams!  Grilled pita overflowing with tender lamp meat (from a spit) with the traditional tomatoes and onions on top.  Tzatziki sauce on the side had a lovely dill \"tang\" to it. really good on the sandwich.  Both the fries and onion rings were pretty straightforward, onion rings were really crisp and not overly battered with a nice flavor.  If I'm in the area again, I will be sure to return!"}
{"text":"Holy Garlic Sauce! After the sauce and the onions on the gyro, I need to swallow a dozen Altoids to neutralize. I love it! The place was very clean, and the Gyro Guys were great! I found my gyro spot. Screw that waiting for 2 hours at The West Side Market for a gyro Crap!"}
{"text":"One of my fav lunch spots. Real close to the office and the food comes fresh since it's always cooked to order. The fresh cut fries are beyond good."}
{"text":"Get the original gyros with hot sauce! Fresh lemonade. Huge portions. Low price. Friendly service from owner!"}
{"text":"Super good gyros, and great guy serving it. Track them down - yelp brought me in (just passing through from out of town) and it was a pleasant surprise in every way."}
{"text":"This gyro is similar to the Cleveland original you would have enjoyed at the Parthenon Restaurant back in the 70's.  So-o-o-o authentic Greek.  Brothers George and Elias are doing it right!  Their shop in Old Brooklyn is easy to find on Pearl Road near State.  I discovered them at Wade Oval Wednesday... So look for them around town at various events and festivals, too."}
{"text":"Wow best gyros in town.  Large amount of meat, hot crispy fries.  The chicken gyro was great."}
{"text":"High-fives. no...? Okay, Four stars.   Delicious gyro I have visited three times and each time satisfied. Each time I have had traditional gyro and tasty french fries. Gyro meat is nice shavings and I add tomato and onion to good pita. Tzatziki is good as well. Holler back.  They have white aprons on the walls filled with good tidings and signatures. At the register is the next work in progress with a Sharpie for you when you visit. This is somewhat like Yelp however you also get a gyro.  Someone please post pictures of this place. I feel depressed writing a Yelp virtual  review. Their logo is a caricature of two Guys that I assume are Greek proprietors. I don't know their names and now I am depressed. I am going to stop typing now."}
{"text":"Great Gyros!  No need to ask for extra sauce, plenty on sandwich.  Great salads also.  Parking on street or behind shop."}
{"text":"Gyro Gyro Gyroooo! GyGO to this spot in Old Brooklyn!! Easy to pass, its on the corner of Pearl and Brooklyn ave. Parking is in the back but theres  maybe like 5 spots, otherwise street parking is necessary.  But okay my experience is what you really care about right? Not my corny review tactics, got it.  Went during the lunch rush, 12:30 ish. The place was busy but the employees were moooooving. Whipping up orders like nobodys business!  I got the buffalo chicken gyro, which was a regular chicken gyro just spiced up. Their tzatziki sauce was amazing! just like it should be. My order came up super quick and the girl behind the counter was very nice and friendly when she brought it to me.  First, let me tell you that the chicken was ridiculously fresh. Like they were probably slaughtering the chicken...FRESHHHH. The gyro came with all the traditional trimmings and i got a back of chips for my side (watch the calories Sasha)...  my gyro was DELICIOUS like there wasnt one bad thing i can say about it. I was beyond impressed, from the outside it looks like its a dive but inside its so nice and clean, charming and the food is great!  Whoever manages this place BRAVO!!"}
{"text":"I hate it when I cant say something mean..but, I ordereds delivery from here ..3 days in a row, and never did I get a bad order..not even an ok..order, all were OUTSTANnnnnnnnnnnnnDING folks...IU have even stopped in once and they are very nice..great job!"}
{"text":"I am very picky about my Greek food having grown up in a Greek-American home, so I am very familiar with authentic Greek food. Gyro guys is the closest thing to eating a meal straight from Yiayia's kitchen around this area. Totally worth trying if you are in the mood for a Gyro."}
{"text":"Wow-great service-quick, cheap, and a great Gyro. Might be hard to spot, and parking is a little rough, but a great discovery. In and out in about 3 min at 12:30"}
{"text":"The gyros are great. The workers are very friendly and this is one of the cleanest restaurants I've been to (even the restroom).  I will defiantly visit here again!"}
{"text":"If you like gyro's this is the place! Very clean and the owners and staff are very nice! Make sure you sign an apron before leaving!"}
{"text":"I could not have made a better decision for lunch. Food delicious, authentic and inexpensive. Service friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Authentic & AMAZING gyros!! The meat was perfectly seasoned and melted in my mouth! My dad is Greek so I know what amazing Greek food tastes like and this is it!! If you're looking for a great gyro in the Cleveland area this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"If you love gyros then you MUST try Gyro Guys! OMG! The food is fantastic and topped only by the friendly and made to order service and hospitality of the owner and staff! (Clean clean clean dining rooms and bathrooms!) Did I mention how fantastic the gyros are at the Gyro Guy restaurant? Trust me, go there hungry!"}
{"text":"The inside is very clean and decorated 'fun'. The gyros were excellent and the tzatziki was very good too. Produce was very fresh and flavorful. We intend on returning very soon. They have some unique gyros on the menu that I need to try out."}
{"text":"Ehh...I mean, it's probably the best gyro you can get in Old Brooklyn but that is not really saying much because the only other places I know of are greasy spoon breakfast joints.  I think what really hurts them is they're keeping their gyro meat in a serving pan and then griddle frying it before serving. I don't see any reason why you would serve gyros any other way than directly off the spit. I'm a bit of a stickler for tzatziki, and the sauce was lacking and more reminiscent of sour cream than the sauce I know and love so well.   I do appreciate the fact that they serve a gyros stuffed with fries, which is a common way to serve the dish over in Greece. So, points for sticking with the traditional roots.   I'm definitely okay with giving them another try, as they're right at the end of my street and I have a great affinity for gyros. I normally don't give anything less than three stars to businesses on a first try basis, but I do remember when they first opened I visited and had a similar experience, as did my grandfather who ventured out with me. Hopefully it was an off day and I'll be pleasantly surprised in the future based on all the other positive reviews!"}
{"text":"Had cornbreef in a pita and fries and when I finished I knew what I wanted for lunch tomorrow.... And the clam chowder taste like I was in cape cod. I just want some more."}
{"text":"2 words...GO HERE!!!!  I'm from Cali and am super picky about my food.  I wish we had a Gyro Guys in LA.   I got the super gyro with extra meat and it tasted incredible.  I'm Greek so I already went in with high expectations of what I thought the food should be like.  Very authentic!  the staff are friendly and most importantly it was a clean environment. I love supporting local businesses. I actually got to meet the gyro guys which I gotta say reminded me of my cousins back home.   great food, great people, clean environment!  I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Had their gyros at a festival.   Never thought you can get such an authentic gyro in old Brooklyn! Highly recommend! Great menu, great service, great prices!  I only give 5 stars to a place that offers something no other place has... This place has some amazing sauce!"}
{"text":"Really good, authentic Greek gyros, with fresh cut fries. Huge portions, reasonable prices, very clean restaurant with great service. My friend had a gyro and loved it, I had the corned beef and it was excellent.  I would go back again."}
{"text":"Bet good. Good service. It didn't take that long during lunch for our food.  The workers were very nice. I would recommend this place....I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Awesome Fresh Squeezed Lemonade.  Outstanding food and service. I love the #4 THE COLOSSUS and the fresh cut fries with there spice on them. Also their Aunt makes the wonderful homemade Baklava."}
{"text":"This is such a cool little spot in Old Brooklyn. We stopped in here on a Saturday a couple of weeks ago. This might have been one of the best gyros I have had in awhile. The meat was cooked perfectly and the portions are very generous, plus you can't go wrong with fresh cut fries. It was quiet but the dining area is clean and the customer service was awesome. I guy behind the counter was extremely pleasant and talked with us for awhile. I give 4 stars because the hours are so limited. It has been open for awhile but Every time I have wanted to go they have been closed."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp while running a work errand near Old Brooklyn. I have a soft spot for gyros -- specifically, my belly -- so I had to investigate.   So glad I did, because I otherwise wouldn't have met The Gyro Guy. And by that, I mean a toasted pita stacked with a generous portion of perfectly griddled gyro meat, juicy chicken breast, fresh cut fries, lettuce, tomato, onions, and a huge dollop of homemade tzatziki (asked for hot sauce on the side, too).   Not sure what they supplier they use, but the gyro meat is more juicy and flavorful than what's served at most other joints. Friendly service, too. Definitely worth the haul down to Old Brooklyn."}
{"text":"One of the better gyros in Cleveland. I did not burp all day like I usually do after consuming gyro meat. This was great because I had lunch with coworkers at Gyro Guys on a Friday and went out on the town that night."}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to go if you are craving a gyro.  So much flavor and a good value for the price!  The fries are excellent too."}
{"text":"Gyro Guys is SO good. And, even better than the food, is the customer service. This is such a great place to have in the neighborhood! GO THERE NOW. What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. My sister has been here several times and said it was good. I came in and the gyro meat was served out of a hearing pan and a lady kept going in the back and bringing single servings of the gyro meat out. Same with the fries. She just went in the back to get it out. I was caught off guard by how the food isn't prepared in front since the equipment is there and available. The gyro itself wasn't impressive and the meat wasn't browned."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant in the area. They have way more then just gyros and everything is always SO FRESH. I love this place never ever disappoints."}
{"text":"I stopped here and am disappointed. The gyros are soggy and the staff not friendly. I love gyros so I know what to expect. Based on reviews it looks like I visited on an off day."}
{"text":"In the old Brooklyn neighborhood where I grew up. Near OLGC. Gyro guy sandwich: chicken and Greek gyro meat with homemade sauce.  Stuffed with fries, onions, and tomatoes.  Combination of all flavors is awesome. Friendly service, clean place and open kitchen area. If in old Brooklyn you need to try this place. I'll be back again. Glad there are still local places like this to call our own."}
{"text":"I have eaten delicious lunches at Gyro Guy's since they first opened.  The interior of the restaurant is truly classic.  They offer a fairly wide menu of Greek cuisine.  Everything I have ordered has been very fresh and perfect tasting.  I most highly recommend the traditional gyro or the signature Gyro Guy.  The staff are super friendly and attentive.  The combination of  the best staff with the freshest ingredients and you're not going to find a better gyro shop around."}
