{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! This place doesn't deserve a star!  Ordered a Philly and a gyro both were garbage!  Not to mention the HARD French fries we got..step your game up Geno's.. Definitely not eating here again!"}
{"text":"Their food is usually good.  The customer service from the employees behind the counters is always going to be an experience; whether good, attentive, distracted, rude,  friendly or confused. Drivers are always friendly. I've been lucky the delivery God's  were smiling down on me because I live LITERALLY 1 block north out of their delivery area, but they still delivered!  that was awesome! Decent food (cheese bread, the bomb!), no hassle cooking, convenient and decent delivery times.  Well my luck tonight has changed, I am saddened by the loss of the delivery to my address. You will be missed, unless I am in the area."}
{"text":"Bad cheessteak. Dry bread. The meat looked funny and dry too. Tasted below average. Won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Being from Philadelphia I know what a cheese steak is supposed to look, smell and taste like, these are pretty close.  Would like to see an American cheese option for the steaks, they put a thin cheese sauce (possibly watered down cheese wiz) but it doesn't help the sandwich.  The sandwich is a good size and for $7.00 the price is good also.  They did mess up someone's order though because when I got home I noticed that I had an extra steak in my bag and it was marked with a different order #.

Now if they could get a supply of Tastykakes i'd be all set"}
{"text":"First time here for a lunch meeting.  I had the chicken cheesesteak \"pizza style\" with marinara and pepperoni and it was phenomenal.  A bit on the greasy side and that left me feeling full well into the evening but overall it was exactly what I was looking for."}
{"text":"I order from Geno's at least once a week -- typically on Friday's after a hard week and I don't want to cook or maybe in the middle of the week after a hard day for a pick me up when I don't want to be bothered to make a meal.  I have tried different things on the menu and have never had a bad experience.  All restaurants make a mistake once in a while.  Once I ordered buffalo wings and was brought honey barbecue--big deal my husband ate the honey bbq and Geno's gave me a discount on the next order.  I repeat, I have never had a bad meal nor one complaint.  Also before ordering for the first time, I went over to the Maricopa Health Inspection Reports website and saw the \"A\" rating which is when I placed my first order and I am now a repeat customer--just ordered again yesterday.  So maybe other reviewers may not have had good luck. I have nothing but glowing praises for Geno's on McQueen--the food has always been delivered hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good and for the price you can't beat it! The employees are super friendly and the wait time is always short! Cesar makes an amazing supreme Pizza Zach and Kailey provide great customer service every time! Thank you Geno's!!!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered from here and it was the worst! My breadsticks were hard as a rock and the pizza was cold! Do not order from here!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service... Ordered a pizza Over the phone went and paid for it and waited 30 minutes in the lobby before somebody gave me The pizza that was sitting on the shelf the whole time"}
{"text":"Had Geno's for lunch today!! Girl at the front super nice and friendly!! Had the meatball sandwich it was absolutely amazing!  And store was clean! Keep up the good work Geno's!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I like to think we are \"Pizza Enthusiast\". We both spend our youths working at pizza places doing every possible job there from cooking to delivery, and enjoy a good piece of Pizza. We like to try new places! We have given Gino's about 5 try's now. They are so close, but just can't seem to get it together. It is apparently obvious that there staff is VERY young and could care less about quality or good service. First, you must like pools of grease- It is just a given on pretty much anything you order. It literally went through two boxes of cardboard and left a pool of grease on our counter. Last week we ordered a pizza, wings and Greek fries. The fries were crispy, which was impressive since they were delivered. The Pizza- the entire large pizza was smashed into about 1 inch on the side of the box, and all the toppings were off of the crust. It was like it was on its side through the entire ride to our house. It was literally unedible. When I called in around 9:30 to let them know, and the attitude was kind of like \"oh well, we are closed so...\" I finally talked to a manager who said he would give me a $25 credit, but they could not resend a pizza since their cook was gone. Well the cook is who delivered the pizza, because he had a dirty apron on. We called last night to use our credit, and of course it was not notated. I had to spend quite a bit of time on hold for them to figure it out, then how to apply it. THEN, they said I had to order MORE food to meet the delivery fee, even though I ordered over $25 worth of food, but since it was covered by a credit it didn't count. When I said this was because of a destroyed pizza,  I was again put on hold. A different person came on the phone and said they would go ahead and deliver it, even with only a $10 remaining balance. When we got the food, of course they did not get our order correct, which is REALLY strange because the lady read back my order exactly like I ordered. I almost feel like when I said I didn't want more food, they added another pizza to up the price of the order. I ended up with two pizzas (not one of which is what I ordered) and then I did get our cheese bread and wings. Just an overall horrible experience. The price for what you get is decent, but I just can't get past how many times they mess up orders (this was not the first OR second time something got messed up in our 5 orders).  To top it off, my husband and I were both sick ALL night from the food. I think I may be paranoid, but it's almost like they added extra food to get more money (for the delivery charge) and then did something to the food for complaining to use a credit I was promised by a manager! So, after giving this place a fair chance, we will stick with Rosati's and Venezia's and spend the extra money for better service and better quality."}
{"text":"update on previous review.. they get negative if i could.. Alex the MANAGER \"got too busy\" over a 3 day period of time and neglected to hold up to his promise to have the 7.50 refunded.. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! SHAME ON YOU ALEX!!!.. i had to call E-24 to request my own refund.. NEVER AGAIN WILL I ORDER FROM HERE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best place ever! The 3 pizza's for $15 is an amazing deal like no other! Their Cheesy Breadsticks are delicious and is cheap! The Cheesesteaks are amazing!!! Ultimately I think this place is the best pizza place ever!! Its much better than Hungry Howies, Little Ceasers, Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Papa Johns. Basically what I'm saying is if you're looking for a good deal than you should 110% go to this place for the deal and the great quality of the pizza, breadsticks, and Cheesesticks!!"}
{"text":"So let me start by saying I only elected to eat here because this place plastered fliers all over the doors at my apartment complex.  So the menu seemed reasonable and I decided to give then a shot.  I placed my order at 9:15pm on Friday ordering a Pizza and Wings nothing crazy.  Well after an hour and 20 minutes passed with no food,  mind you I paid in advance with my credit card.  I decided to call back,  the young lady who answers the phone initially said they were closed when she answered. After I explained I'm still waiting on my delivery she stated the driver will be here any minute. Well another 30 minutes has passed and it's well past 11pm.  There is still no food,  my card has been charged and there is no one available to answer my calls.  I will NEVER try or recommend this place to anyone. And I will be filing a formal complaint with BBB."}
{"text":"Food here tastes pretty bad...delivery took a really long time and I live right down the street. I wanted to give it a good review. Better off at sidewinders or jimmy johns."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for lunch because it is close to the office.  First time last time.  Food is tasteless.  I don't think the developer of the menu has even been to 'philly\" yet they supposedly sell Philly sandwiches.  Not even close.   Skip it. They won't be around long unless they change the products they use to make their food.  As I said. ... tasteless."}
{"text":"First of all, who \"runs out of ranch\" when 2 of their main items has ranch on them. So no one can order a chicken bacon ranch sandwich or pizza? Cool guys! Do you even know where you are located...people LOVE ranch here! Stock up or your never going to last.
Second, the pizzas are not that great. You get over charged for a thin pizza with hardly any toppings on it. You can tell they aren't fresh toppings. I'm wondering how this place even still has business with the crap they serve. 
You will have better pizza with pizza hut...and more of it! Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this location twice now.  1st time was a take out order.  Food was fine, service was ok.  The people at the counter aren't rude, but they certainly aren't friendly either. I hear this is a newer location, so maybe the help is new to the service industry.  Now the 2nd time we dined in the restaurant.  Counter people again are just past teenage range and look like they would rather be doing anything else than working.  Again, the food is ok, nothing extraordinary about it.  This is where the service can make up for the food, but no one came over to ask if everything was ok, how was the food,  no goodbye or thank you when we left.  We were the only people in the place besides 2 other guys, so it wasn't due to the heavy business.  At the point when we left, there was 1 lone guy in the back and as soon as we passed the doors, the 2 teenaged girls popped out.  Hopefully, they will hire some people that know service is just as important as the food is to their success.  May come back in a few months when they get the kinks out."}
{"text":"By far, the worst cheesesteaks I've ever had. Zero flavor and soggy. Garlic sticks tasted like cardboard."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, food was fresh, hot, and very good. Would definitely order from here again and also would recommend to my friends. I've had pizza, wings, and zucchini sticks."}
{"text":"Not sure why these reviews are so bad... Guys, the pizza is great! Yes, some places have their faults, but it's really kind of out of the company's control that someone's pizza got to them all distorted because it had a rough delivery but they happily replaced the pizza for another one so why the bad review?! The pizza is so amazing! For only 5 bucks for a large pepperoni it's an amazing deal because you get your flavored crust and the size is perfect! This is probably my new pizza place, to be honest. I am a really harsh pizza critic because it happens to be my favorite food, but this pizza was so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Starting to really love the pizza here, delivery only so far since I'm lazy jk.  haven't been disappointed to this point. Toppings are plentiful, cheese to sauce ratio  haven't tried flavored crust yet. Wings aren't bad, Need to try in store! Hot out the oven. Delivery has been outstanding"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. They plaster my apartment with coupons so I thought I'd use the four items for $20 and just taste test a bunch of stuff with my boyfriend (who wants me to note that he says, \"Hello, Yelp!\"). We call to place our order and they tell us they won't honor that special anymore. Instead, they can give us 3 for $15. Okay? But fine. We order a pizza, philly cheese steak, and philly fries. Employee says no, we can only have regular fries. We ask him to explain, and he ends up giving us the philly fries. We get there about 10 minutes later. I tried the fries first and thought they were disgusting. Then I took a bite of the pizza and realized the fries tasted better! The boyfriend says the sandwich was \"alright, peppers and onion were practically nonexistent. But the meat was okay.\" All in all, we regret going here for dinner. Maybe it'd be best to eat when you're sloppily drunk."}
{"text":"Dump of a joke. Just awful service that keeps getting worse. I actually feel a bit bad for the disrespectful little brats that are forced to work there. And the minimum service delivery charge for 5 minute delivery is always a painful conversation. They are the closest pizza place to our neighborhood, but also the worst service, pizza and overall attitude. I cant imagine how they're still in business and I hope that it doesn't continue much longer.
Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"My wife and I want to Geno's because our usual (and favorite place) Venezia's was packed.  To be honest, we should have waited at Venezia's.

We each had a slice and split the Greek Salad.  The pizza was horrible, reminded me school lunch pizza.  The dough at Geno's tasted frozen and looked unappetizing when I lifted up to look at the bottom.  

We will not be back and wouldn't recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"This place is within walking distance.  Hey man... if we want to go out, we send the kids up for some Pizza here.  They love it... I tried the philly, it's messy just like it needs to be... all over the place!   Taste great...!  

Give it a try!  Great for movie night too!  Lot's of choices... and the price is SOOO reasonable..."}
{"text":"Best tasting Philly steak cheese sandwich i have ever experienced. 
The real thing with cheese wiz, i have tried numerous places here in Arizona and no one comes close to yours. 
Thank you for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"I'll admit, I really wasn't expecting much from the \"$5\" large cheese pizza deal. BUT..it was an amazingly good pizza for $5!! GREAT DEAL!! I haven't had anything else from Genos yet, but the pizza deal was a hit!
. 
\"Bad service\"..and just shy of tears over \"running out of ranch dressing\".are you kidding me?? Oh my, I'd almost wonder if a competitor wrote that. As clearly pointed out, you place your order at the counter, and pick it up...period. (Did you actually go to Genos?) And Ms. Lost without ranch girl sounds like she seriously needs a life..and some basic understanding of what a REAL problem is. Welcome to the neighborhood Genos. Not ALL of us are crybabies. :)"}
{"text":"They're rude and didn't even do the modifications that i asked for. I just asked for a veggie pizza w/ NO cheese and so he snapped back and said \"basically a veggie pizza.\" It should not be that hard to not put cheese on a pizza..."}
{"text":"Just tried to place an order and these jokers dont have a menu online. Its hard to give you money if you wont let me!"}
{"text":"This place has some really really really good food, don't get why it has 3 stars. I'm from back east and the food remind me of home. Give it a try you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Great please to get pizza.  Decent prices and great food. For 24 bucks you get 2 large 1 topping pizza and 20 wings bone in or bone less what an awesome deal anywhere else your paying almost 40 bucks for something like that. And the staff is very nice on the phone and they had the pizza to my house I would say with in 25 mins and was told 45minutes which is awesome for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"My teen son and I just moved here from California in the summer. I was worried he wouldn't like the pizza here since he was so stuck on his favorite place back home but he loves it! We both love it. He always orders a cheese pizza with a topping or two and I always order the veggie pizza. Their veggies are fresh and the sauce is as well. It's not over done with salt.

I also have ordered the Gyro Pita, Greek Salad, Zucchini Stix and the Mushroom Philly Cheese Steak which was so good! It's funny, my son hates mushrooms but he tried this sandwich and loved it. Gooey with deliciousness! 

All the food is really good that we have tried so far."}
{"text":"This is the second and last time I will order from here again. We ordered a pizza and salads online. Easy. 
An hour later good finally arrives, wife and Son say its not the drivers fault. I agreed and was respectful. 
The Pizza had been sitting in the box for so long the cardboard was sticking to the pizza testing every slice in half  with the center of pizza glued to the cardboard box. Not good!
Oh yeah we were obstaining from meat for Lent so we ordered a half cheese and veggie. Great, pizza arrives :( half veggie HALF EXTREME PEPPERONI CHEESE.
Yeah, sorry no I won't do that again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night- two cheesesteaks- one chicken philly, one sweet pepper with steak. They switched the meats, so my husband and I ended up having to eat each other's cheesesteaks, and neither of us was happy. Took an hour and 10 mins to deliver, so I wasn't about to call and ask for new cheesesteaks. Sloppy work, Geno's."}
{"text":"Tried a slice at work. Place is nasty.

Also, leave my house alone people!! This business constantly leaves a huge ad on my front door lock with tape. I have a do not solicit sign. Tell your young man solicitor to abide by our request. It's not difficult.  I'd be willing to try your pizza fresh instead of in the office but you guys over advertise in the neighborhood and flyers in mail. We get it. You're desperate for business so saturate the market...  Make better pizza..You'd have a chance then."}
{"text":"Had to go back two times they just could not get order right, I get home and its wrong again so thistime I called to speak to management and his name is zack very rude,telling me he is the one who made it and was never told about peppers being on side , needless to say my food was horrible and I live to far to have to go back for the 3rd time."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were good, but the pizza was lacking. They used too much corn meal. Pizza crust should not tear your gums."}
{"text":"We've only ordered take out here and it has been good each time. They have prompt delivery and an extensive menu, which is nice for kids who eat different things."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal Geno's customer for almost 4 years. At least once a month we order. It is great pizza, not the best in service, but good food. Yesterday was the very last straw! If I could give 0 stars I would! Not only did we order almost 3 hours ahead of time and confirmed multiple times for a 4:45pm delivery, but it was a large 15 pizza order! $$$$$ At 5:30pm they FINALLY answered the phone after calling them 16 times, and said \"OOPS We forgot!\" Thank you for ruining my son's 6th birthday! The delivery driver showed up without even an apology!! When I asked for the GM's information I was told that there is no GM, only an owner. Then when I asked for the owners information I was told to go online. Interesting that there is NO CONTACT information on their website and their social media is out of date! How do you run a business like this? TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE! POOR BUSINESS PRACTICE!!  You have lost a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"I love this place, discovered it a couple weeks ago and I've already ordered 4 or 5 times. We love the pizza and my wife loves the feta greek salad. Last time I ordered the philly cheese steak. Sure I've never been to Philadelphia, and some snobs would say that render's my opinion worthless, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it. My favorite would be the 14\" pizza with feta, cheddar, and bacon."}
{"text":"Love this place! Open late and quality ingredients, have a beer while u wait. Or have them deliver for pennies on the dollar, super consistent."}
{"text":"Pizza was just OK, ....had to drag the counter person away from her iPhone to get her to take our order. Ate our pizza there (lunch) as we fought off the flys. The staff, including cook, looked like they were working at at a jiffy lube between cooking food. Pretty sure the board of health could kick some ass here."}
{"text":"My roommates and I love Genos, we order pretty often. We love getting it delivered. We all work full time jobs and occasionally we don't want to cook. Genos is awesome for those times. I recently ordered and wanted delivery, the wait was an hour and a half to two hours!!! That is ridiculous, no place should EVER have a wait that long. On top of that, we ended up opting for pick up, the people who worked there had no sense of phone presence and no customer service. They were very much 16 year olds at their first job not having a care in the world. No one asked for my name or number, how would they know what order was who's?? 

I don't think their food is good enough to deal with incompetent employees. That was probably one of the last times I'll order food from there."}
{"text":"I can't speak on the cheesesteaks that others seem to not like as I haven't had them and I frankly am just not an expert on cheesesteaks.  However, I know good pizza and their pizza is a pretty good NY style, thin but not crunchy pizza.  Their salads are hearty and fresh, their fries are decent, and their turkey sub was delicious.

And I'm pretty sold on a fresh $5 large cheese pizza that I can actually have delivered and not have to go and pick up.  Someone else said they are small but they are a 14\" pizza which is the same size large as most pizza places.  It's a thin pizza, like NY style, so perhaps that is his complaint.  If you like a thick doughy crust then you might be disappointed, but this style of pizza is my favorite.  It's better than any of the major chains and most of the locally owned places, too.

*UPDATE* - After eating here a few more times I realized their pizza really isn't THAT good.  Their NY style pizza is better than their $5 standard pizza, but I no longer order their pizza.  I am, however, still giving them 4 stars because their turkey sandwich is just so delicious I get regular cravings for it and I think for just $5 the pizza is still fine.  It's still better than a frozen pizza, which would be $1 more.

I normally order from GrubHub so I can't really comment on the service, but the driver's have always been polite, I have no complaints there.  I'm a little confused by a review by someone who dined in and didn't receive good service because no one came to check on them.  It's not really a \"dine in for the experience\" place, so I frankly find it bizarre that someone would expect any kind of table service in what is generally a take out place, and then leave a 2 star review over it.

I'm not a fan of their wings or their cheese sauce (which I like to have for fries), but every place has a few misses, and chances are someone else will love what I don't.

I hope others who feel the same way will start leaving reviews as well.  I feel like the ones left so far are bizarre reviews based on some irrelevant things and doesn't represent this place at all."}
{"text":"Worse customer service and delivery. Order a pizza over an hour late. Decided to call talked the worker who then got the manger for me... exact words \" yes your pizza has been sitting here, the delivery person never picked it up. I'm guessing that you don't want it.\" You think!!!!  You could not call me or have a plan b!!!! \"Oh and I can't refund your money since you ordered from yelp, sorry.\" That was it ... no offer to make another or anything what a joke. Never ordering there again. calling a third party to get my money back tomorrow"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place. Ordered the Geno's famous cheese steak. It was one of the worst cheese steaks I have ever attempted to eat. The bread was stale. The flavor of the cheese wiz (even though there was very little) dominated the sandwich and ruined it. The beef itself was flavorless. The place was clean. Service was mechanical. Portion was large. I will likely not return"}
{"text":"Cheese pizza with the ranch crust! Only $5. So yummy! I don't understand why the reviews are so low. We walked in, they greeted us, and were so sweet... Took our order, had it out within 10-15 minutes. My husband ordered the Philly cheesesteak and wasn't very impressed but the pizza made up for that. Everything from the sauce they use to the crust was so delicious and you can't beat that price. We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas with a 18.99 coupon and a extra garden salad, came to 33 something? The garden salad was so old and soggy they had to put a third inch thick solid hunk of onion on top to help mask the smell of the rotten iceberg lettuce. If you ever order food here ( hope for your health you don't) , don't prepay and make sure you check food (garbage) before delivery driver runs for the get away car!!!"}
{"text":"A bad experience here will keep us from going back again. We drove 15 minutes to grab 2 cheesesteaks... One with meat and cheese only. Get home to find the sandwich was covered in mayo. Called in to simply let them know our order was wrong and asked if they could deliver the correct order, given that it was their error. The cook argued with me that we ordered it wrong and refused to help. Such poor service.. Which they could have made delightful really easily."}
{"text":"I only get the chicken cheesesteak here and it is about as good as you can get. They have good specials at lunch time. They have free WiFi and 3 large tv's always play sports."}
{"text":"Pizza was cold when I was delivered.  I'm not sure why because I'm less than 1 mile away.  After warming it in the microwave it was good."}
{"text":"Our restuarant pick is Geno's.

I was really hoping this was going to be good. Gyro.......sub par. C-
Baked turkey sub.....good flavor......I liked it.  Give that a B
Mediterranean salad tasted like ass. The chicken looked like cat food, half the stuff I ordered on line WASNT on it. The online menu lets you customize it, and to top it off, nothing like getting home and finding no dressing in your bag. 
Pizza tasted like a $5 pizza, no pizzaz there, nothing to write home about.

My pick up was right on time, didn't have to wait. Geno's gets a solid C- for us."}
{"text":"I ordered food 2 hours ago...they just now got here. And the whole order is wrong. The delivery guy also forgot our 2 liter of soda in his car. What the hell? I do not recommend this place at all. The food isn't even that great to begin with to be worth the wait and mess up."}
{"text":"I guess they can't all be winners. I ordered a cheesesteak and onion rings for delivery. The order came in about a half hour, which is great, but the food looked like it had time traveled back from a dark future in which it had been sitting out for days.

Let me be more specific. The onion rings were soft and flaccid. When I picked one up, the breading sloughed off like skin from a water-logged zombie. The taste was also suspect, as if sugar was added to the breading. The cheesesteak was soggy. I'm not sure if they popped it out of the oven and dunked it in a bucket of dishwater or what. 

Here's what I know: I couldn't finish the onion rings, so I put them in my dog's bowl. She wouldn't eat them. I should mention that she will eat her own feces, if given the chance."}
{"text":"We've ordered here many times and it's usually a pizza to go or a cheesesteak to eat in.  Been ok (you get what you pay for) up until today.  We ordered two cheesesteaks to go and got home 15 minutes later to find the sandwiches were wrong.  Called to kindly ask for our correct order to be delivered.  Many other fine establishments would probably do something to help rectify the situation.  Not this restaurant.  Instead the person who answered argued with me that asking for \"meat and cheese only means we add a ton of mayo as well\" instead of trying to do right by their mistake.  I'll happily pay more money for better food and better experiences in the future.

There is truth in the overall rating for this place."}
{"text":"Hope this place is known for their cheesesteaks cause the pizza is basically an expensive Little Caesars.

wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Walk in at 4:40 PM with two customers whom have already had their order taken, my girlfriend placed her order for a Philly cheese steak, I ordered Cajun fries and a pizza sandwich. 18 minutes later we my girlfriends sandwich was delivered with the fries and the worker was confused when I asked about my sandwich. So I ask for it and he states it will be right out. 3 more groups of customer come in, order and sit down. 30 minutes now and I see a worker deliver my sandwich to a different guest for which it is promptly returned. 7 minutes later it's given to me, the same sandwich. (Health code violation) now I return it and at the 50 minute mark I got my sandwich burned. Stay away from eating in? Yeah for sure. I should have checked the reviews of this hovel first before ordering food here. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"No, just no. I ordered one of their $5 pizzas over the phone and set off to get it. I live about 10-15 mins away from them which is what the lady said it would be before my pizza was done, cool. I get there and pay, the guy at the counter seem a bit out of it but umm whatever cause PIZZA! So I set off home and about 5 mins into my ride I reach in the box and grab a slice (don't judge me we have all eaten in the car at one time or another) and wow. It was the worst pizza ever @ a tie with Little Caesar's and my elementary school cafeteria. I'm not likely to ever go back considering I don't like spongy pizza. I thought I found a cheaper alternative to Valencias but I rather pay $5.36 or a couple good slices rather than a whole bad pizza. You pay for what you get."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, they food tasted like it sat for a long time. They did not deliver any napkins even though I wanted napkins. The order also came with multiple ranches from the food that was ordered; however, we only received one. Everything tasted stale and cold."}
{"text":"Only giving one star because no stars is not an option! Ordered 2 large pizzas and an order of fries; after waiting for over an hour (I live less than a block away from the establishment), we received our slightly warm pizzas and fries that appeared to be soaked in grease and/or dropped in the fryer one too many times. 

I immediately called the supervisor who seemed less than interested in my complaint. Mind you, I wasn't even complaining about the pizza not being hot....I can microwave that. But the fries? Unexceptable.  Apparently \"fries are made to order typically right before the driver is set to leave\". Mai's resolution: I'll credit an order of fries to your next order. That's great, if I planned on ordering from Geno's again. 

I do not recommend delivery (or fries) from this eatery. Horrible experience, horrible food and horrible excuse from management. Two thumbs down Geno's."}
{"text":"This is the second time out of 3 times where it was over 1 hr 30 min for delivery. And the food was \"warm\". I live in an apartment and every time but once, I get a phone call from the driver saying they are lost. I walk out and have to guide them to me. I don't mind most times, but every time? 

I was told that it was under new management so thought I would give it a try. Never again. I love the pizza, when it's hot, but after waiting double of what is stated on the web site, I'm done. A phone call saying it's running late would have been nice."}
{"text":"Horrible service, last time there did a carry out went inside the girl behind the counter was telling a story to a co-worker, after waiting a few minutes she told me someone would be with me in a minute 8 minutes later after her story was over she looked at me rolled her eyes went into the back and had someone else come out to help me so she could talk some more, then today they forgot to put my order in so my order was never placed. Awesome so done with this place"}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch break. Ordered. Have now been waiting almost ny entire linch break and still no food. Everyone else in my party and the restaurant has been served. They have now asked me three times what I'm waiting on... shortly my response will be A REFUND!"}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars I would. 
Geno's had some nerve. The flyer guy delivered flyers for this business to my apartment door at three am in the fucking morning. 
He STOMPED up my stairs causing my roommate to wake up first. 
My dog heard his stomping and began to bark. At Three am. 
He woke me and my fiance up. 
All to place a flier on my door. 
At three am. 
Upon informing him of the time and telling him how loud he was being he told me to go the fuck back to sleep then 
He was high or drunk. Maybe both. 
Upon calling the company they did absolutely nothing. I will not ever eat here again."}
{"text":"I don't care how good your pizza is....when you tape ads to my front door right next to the \"No Soliciting\" sign.....you get one star.....and you don't get my business. If previous reviews are any indication, doesn't look like I'm missing much but some disappointment."}
{"text":"I'm appaled by the Geno's bashing on here.....this place has the best philly's and pizza on the east side, maybe the city.

I started going here because their phillys were recommended to me, and didn't dissapoint, super cheesey, quality ingredients, great soft buns.

Eventually I learned about their new York style pizza.....omg, huge slices of the best new york style in the city.

People here must complain about their discount pizzas, they're OK, but the new york style...the good ones...is the best around."}
{"text":"Well, we've given them 3 chances in the last two weeks to provide even basic customer service and have been let down every time. We won't be back. The first issue was 2 weeks ago on a Friday after a football game. We called to place an order but were told that they were too close to closing time to do anything \"special\". The next day, ordered pizza to pick up for a birthday party. Arrived about 25 minutes later (knowing that when they say 15, it's usually longer). When I arrived to pick up they hadn't even started the order. I didn't learn of this until I had already paid. Then when they said it would be another 20 minutes I was livid. I had ice cream in the car. They refunded the money and did not once offer to deliver (they offer this service within 5 miles). The third and final straw was when I tried to order for delivery (hoping they could get it right) and the air head who answered spent more time giggling with the other air heads in the room and paid no attention to what she was doing on the phone. I ordered a gluten free pizza after asking her to please focus on her task, and she proceeded to tell me that I could not get gluten free for the $5 price. I told her I was aware of that. Then I tried to order two regular pizzas and she repeated TWICE more that the gluten free would not be the $5 pizza. Listen idiot! I know this! I ended up hanging up the phone I was so pissed."}
{"text":"Regulars here.  Great place and great food.  Pizza is a steal of a price at times.   Cheesesteaks are addicting.   Sometimes messy and greasy but hey   That's really what you are there for !"}
{"text":"Well I would've been able to write a food teview had the young lady answering the phone had been knowledgeable about her job. I called in an order for delivery. This place is 2 mi from my large apt complex and im positive if you deliver, you should be familiar. She asked me if I was north or south of the cross street that I gave her. I said south, then she asks if they have yo cross that main street.....well im new here and told her I dont know where exactly she's located, again...with am I north or south....again I tell her south and the name of complex....again.....does she have to cross the main street??!?  fml *click*"}
{"text":"This is the cleanest pizza place I have ever been in, from the common area to the men's room, everything was spotless.  The steak sandwich was delicious and the staff is very courteous and helpful every time I go in, love this place!"}
{"text":"I've ordered pizza here before and it's ok but NEVER again. I received a coupon in the mail for 2-large, 20 wings for $16.00. I got it this week. They said it was no longer valid (no date on the coupon either) and refused to honor it.

I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'd give zero stars if I could. Got take out through a delivery service and the food was soggy and unappetizing. Tried it because I was starving waiting for the meal, filled with hardly any meat, cheese, or vegetables which is what I requested. Jalapeño poppers were poorly done.. almost didn't want to review because I understand difficulties in the restaurant business. But at the prices they have , I'd stay away from this establishment. The \"food\" in my trash can attached."}
{"text":"Ordered via GrubHub based on ratings in their app, and so glad i did. Got 2 large pizzas with an online coupon they had and the price,  including delivery charge and to was reasonable.   Had it delivered to a sand tournament venue.  They were a touch early,  met me at the exact spot i requested.  Had the philly cheesesteak pizza and a pizza with just veggies.   Both were fantastic!   The tomato sauce is great.... not too acidic with good flavor.  I took one star off because they didn't bring napkins or plates....i could have requested but given they were delivering to Mesquitw Beach, one would think this would occur to them :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten there are two times not impressed at all talking about the cheesesteaks( pretty bad ) last time I got one didn't have much meat on it  so this time ( give them another try ) I got one with extra meat very expensive it was bad  but home is Philadelphia so I may be expecting too much from a cheesesteak in Arizona but  I have lived here 25 years and I've had much better cheesesteaks at different places here in beautiful az"}
{"text":"Received a flyer on our apartment door for Geno's Pizza & Cheesesteaks. We wanted to order a large spinach & meatball pizza with bread sticks and a 2 litre only to find out that they do not deliver to our address less than 3.5 miles from their location. 

I wish I could review the food (it looks good!) but will never go to this establishment. As a business, if you're going to pay a person/service to plaster an apartment complex with your flyers that say you deliver, you better damned well deliver."}
{"text":"Love this place! Inexpensive and delicious! The only complaint is their pizza doesn't always taste the same but it still great especially for the price!"}
{"text":"Normally I love this place for delivery. Tonight I decided to pick up. While waiting I went to the restroom and saw there was no toilet paper. I told the girls, and they apologized, but didn't put any toilet paper in the bathroom. They both just continued to work the non busy front counter. I waited a bit longer and decided to use the men's room. When my order was ready they informed me they didn't have any Caesar dressing for my Caesar salad and asked if I wanted a different dressing. No!  It's a Caesar salad. So I had to choose a different salad all together. There still wasn't any toilet paper when I left."}
{"text":"The pizza here is awesome! Way better then the chains. The wings are a little dry but my sister said she loves them because she doesn't like them all juicy...so different strokes for different folks and it's all in what you prefer. We both love the pizza...along with the whole family. You can get a pizza here for little Caesars price at way better quality."}
{"text":"Simple, great tasting pizza for $5? I'm in.
Some people may disagree, but I really enjoy their pizza. It's close to home, I can order through Yelp, have it delivered or pick up. Their eat in area is clean, the employees are professional and courteous. They have a few big screen tv with football usually on them."}
{"text":"Splurge an extra ten dollars and get Frankie's, Venezia's, or one of the other amazing pizza places in the area. If I could go back in time and un-eat this pizza, I would."}
{"text":"Customer service is great! Philly cheesesteaks are  would def go back and try their pizza!"}
{"text":"An $18 delivery limit? Are you freaking kidding me? Biggest bullshit I have ever heard."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The counter help couldn't be bothered. I am from back east and a bit of a sub snob but this place doesn't even come close to good for az standards."}
{"text":"I ordered 10 wings on line.  Went to pick them up and came back into my all day meeting to find out I only got 4 edible wings. The other 6 look like the bottoms of the bag or table scrap's. I go to the genos on Paco's and Higley all the time. Never any issues. I will go to ATL wings for now on, it's more of a drive but at least I get real wings and not cutlets legs (post pictures). #outrage"}
{"text":"Best cheese steak in AZ. Incredible amount of meat on sandwich. Would need to get triple meat from any other place to even come close. I'm SOLD on trying everything on the menu...soon."}
{"text":"I've got a very happy belly right now... 

Geno's is a small local chain that seems more like a big National chain. I've been growing rather fond of this franchise lately. There are about half a dozen or so locations around the Valley, and each is owned by different people. This location happens to be one of my favorites (this owner's other location is my other favorite), though I do like them all. 

Having sampled the cheesesteak a few times, I can say with confidence that it's superb and authentic. I've also now tried their pizza, and that's also excellent. There's a lot of flavor packed into every bite of food I've had here, and you get a lot of bang for your buck. 

This is the sort of place you'll get a craving for. I'm slightly outside of the delivery range of this spot, but it's easily worth the drive. The prices here are great, it's clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is delicious and awesome. Can't really go wrong. Not sure what else you would need to make a place 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to update this review every time I have gone back, but for once, my procrastination has paid off, as I am able to give you a more condensed version this way.
The $5 pizza has gone progressively down hill. Not so much that I didn't keep going back. Still beats the pants off a Little Caesars.. or does it?
First it got smaller and I forgave it. Then it became $6 AND smaller, and I forgave it. Then somebody got reeeeaaally heavy handed with oregano, and I stopped eating the back of my crust, which used to be the best part but is now an oregano monstrosity. Still, I forgave. But last night. Eh.
The cheese was rubbery, the crust was sad, and I threw away more than half of a pizza we normally finish. Especially one that is much smaller. Thats a bummer. I really liked the place when they first opened."}
{"text":"The pizza is alright.

My bone to pick is that they keep mailing us coupons for $16 for wings + pizza. We get them weekly for the past 5 months! If you call and try to redeem it they will tell you they \"don't offer that coupon anymore\" or as one employee said \" that was a misprint and we were told not to honor them\". 

I would give them zero stars for not honoring their coupons."}
{"text":"Julia was very helpful at helping us pick out our wings. They were great! Garlic Parm wings are to die for. They delivered quick"}
{"text":"Its a typical place for cheap pizza kind of expensive cheesesteak .. pizza as good as the old pizza pizza little ceasers but better then frozen.. had the cheese steak decent size for 10.00 nothing spectacular but not bad. all in all don't expect a real cheese steak or super pizza its a fast food joint with girls at the front with no knowledge of product they are selling and kind of a boring look with a bunch of tvs on all on different channels ok . pizza cheese 5 bucks so what do you expect it is what it is.. great place for cheap quick pizza.. no affiliation with the true Genos in Philly .."}
{"text":"The service here is great! Everyone is really nice and the place is very clean. The food is delicious and the prices are great. I was shocked at how quick they are (both carry-out & delivery). Fun place with yummy food!"}
{"text":"They have a awesome $5 large one topping which includes a flavored crust of your choice. It's a perfect offer to take them up on at anytime!"}
{"text":"I used this newfangled thing called \"the internet\" to locate a pizza place near me and order. We spent the obligatory twenty minutes figuring out our pizzas and subs and sides, and were well prepared to spend the 50$ this order would've come to. At first, they tried to tell us we were on the wrong website and when I read her the address off of the website she replied, \"Oh, that is the right site. But it's really outdated.\" At the beginning of the call which lasted roughly five minutes, the wait time was forty five minutes, which is perfectly fine for a Saturday night. But by the middle of the call it had somehow inflated multiple times, to two hours. We ended up ordering from zellaspizza.com, which only had a forty five minute delivery time, near perfect online reviews, a functional website, and they honored all of their advertised coupons."}
{"text":"We chose to try this place out because we got a coupon for \"4 items for $20\" and because we were having a lazy night... So what the heck right?!

We chose a pepperoni pizza -  it was alright nothing crazy. 
I chose provolone cheese steak -  pretty good for the price.
The bf chose thr anti pasta salad for work lunch -  seems like what you would expect for a cheap salad... Eeek. 
Last, the bf got the buffalo chicken ranch sandwich -  I've never seen him not finish a sandwich and he threw away over half of this one...

So, all in all, it was what you would expect for the price. I was hoping to prove all the other reviews wrong."}
{"text":"Have wanted to try this place for awhile and today on a bike ride, I suggested we go there. When we got there, there was no place to lock up our bikes so I asked if we could bring our bikes inside. The girl went to the back and came back and said we could not bring them inside. Really?? You have 2 other people eating in your restaurant. Our bikes will not disrupt your thriving business. They will sit there and behave themselves.... You lost business. I will not try to come back."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a friend. Being from the culinary community I understand the rarity of a good Philly cheese stake. I came in at 1:20 am on a Monday morning that was very slow. I ordered a Philly cheese steak immediately and after about 20 minutes the pizza someone 2 people behind me ordered came out. I asked what was taking so long and was told to wait. It's now 2:05 My order has been reversed along with 6 other people that have also been waiting. Needless to say my appetite and my money will never again grace this establishment."}
{"text":"Delicious! Love their specialty pizzas, always get the 5 seasons crust. Love Genos, best delivery pizza I've had in the East Valley!"}
