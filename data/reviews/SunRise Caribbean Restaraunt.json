{"text":"Sorry guys, I had high hopes for this place, but here were my experiences..... First time, which was the best of all, produced large portions, and some good jerk chicken.  Second time, I wanted to try the jerk pork, considering the chicken seasoning was at par. Aside from having no zing, the pork was chewy, stringy, and flavourless. Third, and unfortunately my last time, I picked up some oxtail, and curry goat. The oxtail tasted like nothing but sugared beef. Way too sweet with little Caribbean zest to it. The goat, was a complete flip, at being way too salty....  I was hoping this was gonna be my new \"goto\" for the flavours of Negril.... With little competition in this town for that cuisine, I wished for a better outcome."}
{"text":"Great service, clean restaurant and best of all the food is so, so good! I've had the chicken roti twice, and it's been amazing each time. They have affordable daily specials for just $5.25! I can't describe how much I absolutely love this place!  It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Authentic Caribbean food. Great portion sizes. Nice Jamaican reggae music playing in the background. They have some of their own beverage that they make with real fruits which is very good. This is my 2nd visit and just as good as my first. The first time a guy placed the flyer in my vehicle's windshield wiper at Upper Canada parking lot  just when I was hungry and deciding where to go. Lol. If you are looking for the real deal, stop by here."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time tonight and the woman working was so rude to the customer in front of me that I left without ordering."}
{"text":"Food is cheap but good and the attitude is sassy!  I came in to meet up with an employee for lunch.  I had the half rack of Jerk Ribs, succulent, fall off the bone, with just a kiss of heat and great flavour.  The plate came with a load of creamy mashed potatoes, gravy and corn.  Add an Island soda to it and you have a great lunch.    The young lady running the place single handed told me she only table serves those she likes.  I feel so special!!!  On another occasion, I just wanted a snack so I grabbed a patty.  Then I had another one.  Then I forced myself to stop before I got stupid...  This place will be a regular for me."}
{"text":"Been 6 times. Food is friggin amazing. My only complaint is I end up over eating every time!!!  Great warm, welcoming service. There is love in this food!"}
