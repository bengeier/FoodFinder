{"text":"I live 2 miles from here and have been wanting to try it. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, chicken caesar salad (the lunch special), garlic knots, and drinks. We were very impressed with the quality of food. The salad was huge and very flavorful. The pizza was very filling and the pizza sauce was unlike anything we've ever tasted. The owner was very friendly.  We gave it a 5 stars! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I like their pizza, but am frustrated at what just happened. I ordered online, which says they close at 845, I selected delivery and went through the entire order process. About 5 to 7 minutes later I get a phone call saying I placed my order after 830, (he said 834 to be exact) which is when they stop delivering, so I could come pick it up if I still wanted it (even though online says 845). Funny thing is, the time stamp on the email confirmation I received said 829, which means my order was placed before 830. I don't like lazy and a good business goes out of their way for the customers. Quality of food isn't the only thing that will keep your customers, it's quality of service as well."}
{"text":"My favorite place. I usually indulge in Tuesday because it buy one get one. The pizza is good. The wings and fingers are great as well. I'm more of a pizza fan. My wife a wing fan. It's nice we can go to one place and get something we both enjoy. 

The staff is great. They always take our order with a smile and don't mind our little tweaks. 

Since we moved we still make the trip for the pizza."}
{"text":"I don't like wings! But, we tried the Sunday & Monday special that includes the bucket of wings....Awesome!!! I couldn't get enough!!! This is the only place that I will eat wings!! Their food is so delicious...my mouth just watered lol"}
{"text":"Good New York Style pizza at a great cost. Really delicious legit crust ( I am from the East Coast). Garlic knots are also excellent with fresh crushed garlic and chicken fingers were also very good. Would definitely recommend to anyone in Northwest Vegas."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery the garlic knots tasted old the pizza was cold and tasted plain be warned the small is only 4 slices! They are overpriced considering the food isn't amazing"}
{"text":"I'm suppose to be on a gluten-free diet but i make exceptions when the food is dam good. Their buffalo chicken pizza is something else entirely. So flavorful with a nice little kick. My only complaint is that they are not open late(9pm). As thats when my 'glutenous-gluttonous candida yeast' cravings really kick into full gear. Oddly enough I can't find them on google maps. Only Yelp. Maybe they should fix that. Don't forget to get two or four, or ninety nine garlic knots. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Their wings were decent and their toppings were fresh, the pizza was cooked well, but something was sill missing.  Overall the pizza was pretty bland to the point I wasn't sure there was any sauce or seasoning on it.  If you are in the area and you are willing to pay the price I would recommend North End Pizza instead."}
{"text":"GLUTEN-FREE AND AMAZING!!!!! Now that I've shouted it to you, I finally found a pizza that I crave. Not a cracker-crust or a board, this gluten-free crust is delicious. The sauce has a delicate blend of perfect herbs and spices. The owners truly care about their product and it shows."}
{"text":"I'm a recent NY transplant and I tried Above The Crust on a whim one day. I've tried a few other places around town and NOTHING is as good! I'm addicted to Above The Crust and I drool just thinking about it. I eat there at least three times a month. I can only speak about the cheese slices (because why bother with toppings? It's just so good plain!) and they are perfect and never disappoint. I ask for mine well-done/extra crispy. 
The owner and whole staff are incredibly friendly! Just GO here!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! I ordered the philly steak sub and the pasta. I usually hate cold pasta but this side was extremely delicious. The sub was really good too, not one complaint about this place."}
{"text":"We saw great reviews, and decided to try something new. We got the $35 large pie and wings deal. The pizza is fine not special. The wings are dried out, we asked for olives and got a bare sprinkling $45 latter we are sadly disappointed  we won't be going back."}
{"text":"My order was wrong and I am still giving them 5 stars!! A restaurant can have great food and fail due to poor service, Above the Crust need not worry about that! 
I ordered off of Eat24, as my child was throwing a fit and making it impossible to have a conversation on the phone. I chose the chicken fingers, garlic knots and the 2 slice special (one w/ pepperoni and sausage the other plain cheese) that also comes with a 20oz drink. I was not kept waiting long! My delivery driver (I did not get his name) was friendly and did not make me feel rushed trying to hand off food as some do. I noticed he had no drink in his hands. Right away he apologized, the problem it wasn't printed on the ticket so he wasn't aware my order needed a drink. He offered to go back and get it, as tonight is my soda night and I really wanted that soda so I readily agreed. He was still so friendly (most drivers get a little attitude when they have to go back for something so small)
I go to dig into the pizza and realize that I got 1 sausage slice and 1 pepperoni slice instead of 1 w/ both and the other just cheese. I call to see about getting it corrected as my kid can only have cheese pizza. Once again the most friendly service. They get it set up to be resent. When my doorbell rings I am expecting my previous driver with my drink and corrected pizza, what I got was the OWNER. He wanted to personally apologize about the mix up! Anytime the owner communicates with customers just shows how much they really care about their business, the fact that he got in his car to bring me my pizza and 20oz drink is AMAZING!
Now let's get to the food! The chicken fingers were phenomenal (I am a self proclaimed chicken finger snob) my kid couldn't get enough of them! I don't know if they are freshly made or frozen (as they are really uniform in appearance I am leaning towards frozen) either way they are awesome! The garlic knots had the perfect ratio, not too garlicky not too doughy. The pizza was delicious! I am a ranch lover... The ranch here is soooooo good! I could literally just spoon it up by itself!
I would recommend this place on the food alone but I will rave about this place for their service! My advice to you fellow yelpers, call in to order. As the Eat24 order gets a little mixed up when put into their system. GREAT PLACE!!"}
{"text":"I'm from New Jersey and I know great pizza!  This is the place in Vegas!  None better. Perfect crust and sauce. Cooked just right and Joey is a class act-without a doubt my favorite place!!

{"text":"My family has been a huge fan of Above the Crust for many years.  Unfortunately, it has gone downhill in the last 6 months.  I believe there is new ownership (or management), and you can tell they are skimping on quality.  In the past...I was more than happy to spend $30-35 for two large pizzas, but I can't justify that price now.  It's just ok, and we have to start looking for another place. :("}
{"text":"Love this place!! The menu selection is great! We have ordered three times now and everything is perfect! Everyone is sooooo friendly too!"}
{"text":"Great Place

I've been living in Las Vegas for 41 years - a transplant from NY - we finally have a great pizza place in the hood...... I just had the Friday night special delivered - large pizza and a bucket of fingers - absolutely delicious.  The pizza came hot and the taste was great, as was the honey bourbon fingers.... the delivery person (Jorge) was delightful and pleasant.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm from NY, got a slice and wings. Slice was really good, wings were good too. The owner is from NY and is really nice. definitely will be goin back for some legitimate new york slices."}
{"text":"Love this place. Routinely order from here for UFC events and football.  So much better than your typical franchise like Dominos or Pizzza Hut.  Real hand made dough and just the right amount of grease!  I'm an east coast guy and know how real Pizza tastes, not this 11 herbs and spice sauce nonsense you see from the franchise models  I need dough, sauce, cheese and grease. I need them in the right combination, in the right proportion, from a perfectly heated oven...and  cooked for the right amount of time.  So far this is the only place in Vegas that I have found that knows how to perform this east coast magic. 

 Place an order and it is always on time to pick up, usually even early.   Reasonable prices, and a super friendly, well trained staff.  And yes, they do deliver if you are actually that lazy."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! The breadstick are mouth watering and the service is wonderful! They have some of the best ranch too!! Must try!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza!! For the last couple weeks we've been ordering from here and it's just perfect every time!! Tonight was the baked ziti pizza and mmmmmm mmmm!!"}
{"text":"Came here last Friday night based upon the Yelp reviews and it was convenient. We got the large AC special pizza for $18.95. The toppings were green bell peppers, onions, sausage and pepperoni. The sausage was round and thinly sliced like pepperoni is. The portion of sauce was okay, not skimpy but not overly generous. The sauce had a slightly sweet flavor to me, which I didn't prefer. Tasted home mad though but still doesn't necessarily mean it is excellent merely because it is home made. 

We took it home so I can't judge whether the crust was crispy or not - we heated it back up when we got home prior to eating on a pizza stone so the crust was crispy. So overall decent thin crust pizza, not on par with Lombardi's in NYC or such but decent. I am a thick crust girl but as thin crust goes I prefer the thin crust (and thick crust) over at Dom Demarco and I personally think that is more \"authentic\". The caveat being I am not from NY but I have ate my way through it.  

I think the price is a little steep for what you are getting but I am glad I tried something new. I wasn't thrilled with the ambience in the restaurant, that was the deciding factor in taking it home. They tried to make it a warm, fresh venue with the paint and decor, however, the acoustics were poor and although there were only a few people in the restaurant it seemed loud."}
{"text":"You guys forgot to cut my pizza at all.... Like not even one slice in the damn thing.... But on a good note it was delicious but your marinara sucks.. Thank you for the delicious pizza. Please remember to cut the pizza tho. Thank you"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place me and my girlfriend came here the other night the staff was friendly and the pizza and garlic rolls are really good ill definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Been living in Las Vegas for a good amount of years now and I must say I was very pleased with the pizza from Above the Crust pizza and you can't go wrong on Tuesdays when their large pizza's are 2 for the price of 1!  The pizza has a very good crispy crust and a good amount of cheese and sauce.  The sauce is a tad bit on the sweet side but at least it has flavor which I can't say about other pizza joints in the area.  The only thing that is holding them back from a 5 star review is I felt they could've added more pepperoni to the pizza.  They're kind of cheap when it comes to toppings.  I will gladly be visiting Above the Crust the next time I'm in mood for a NY style pizza on Tuesday."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by and check out this place based on fellow Yelper reviews.  As soon as I walked in the door the yummy aroma made my mouth start to water.  The restaurant was neat and clean, and the specials were clearly posted.  The staff was friendly and believe in service with a smile.  I visited around 7 PM and there wasn't anyone ahead of me, so I got my order wicked fast. I ordered the daily special: 2 slices with 2 toppings and a drink for $7.52 after-tax.  I also decided to spring for a 99-cent garlic roll.  The garlic roll was soft and warm and made with real garlic chunks (Yum).  The pizza was just average to me... not bad, but yet not outstanding.  Overall, I would visit again if in the area and needed some quick eats."}
{"text":"Well my mom came in here for lunch today with some Co workers and insisted we come back for dinner. . My father and I had the fried zucchini as an app which was incredible to say the least!  And we also had their baked ziti pizza. ....TO DIE FOR! My mom had the meatball parm sub that's or of this world. . The sauce is home made and so full of flavor it should be illegal!  If your not eating here I don't know what your doing with your time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love pizza!!! We found this place by looking up pizza joints, we came across this place, We read there reviews 4 1/2 stars so we decided to try it today.  Pizza was not good!  It tasted like processed cheese!  Pepperoni was okay, crust was okay.  Service was good and clean.  Later in the day, my stomach did don't feel well, lots of heart burn, which I never get. Good pizza deals but not good food, will not eat there again!"}
{"text":"This pizza place is our the pizza place now. It is cheap and tasty. We used to go to other pizza join, but I got tired of paying $40 for each time. This place, Family of 4 can get full within $20. It is perfect weekday lazy dinner. On Tuesday, we can buy a large pizza and get another large cheese pizza for free. We can even get 2 dinners out of the price. Very economical!"}
{"text":"Great place great price and very friendly staff the food is well proportioned and delicious first time eating here but will definitely stop by if I'm in the area again"}
{"text":"I was going to order a large cheese pizza and they told me it was going to cost $17 dollars. I told them to cancel the order. The person on the phone asked why i said it was too much for just a cheese pizza. The person on the phone then told me to enjoy Little Caesars. O snap!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in town. Seriously! Huge slices great toppings and good specials! Hope all of you enjoy"}
{"text":"Drove by for lunch , man this place is bomb , pizza on point , will definitely be back here"}
{"text":"By far my favorite pizza place! They have the best customer service and their fingers and sausage pizza are to die for!"}
{"text":"This is the first time we have ordered from Above the Crust, and honestly it will be the last. We were told our order would be 1-1.5 hours, ends up being 2. By all mean i understand it's a Friday and and places are busy, but being in the food industry Myself I know that it's best to give a longer time estimate just to cover ones a**. Secondly we were being charged for Caesar's salads (what was originally ordered) then told afterwards that they were out of romaine, so essentially paying 10$ for garden salads. Then being told that all they could do was say \"sorry, were just really busy.\" Now I will give credit where it is due and say they were gracious enough to give us 20$ back credit after calling and speaking with a manager. As for the food, it's decent honestly. The marinara sauce is pretty weak though. And the ranch has too much garlic but we all have a preference and that is my opinion."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good for the area. Not as good as I was expecting based on all of the 4 and 5 star reviews (almost seemed reheated even though we ordered a fresh pie). I didn't care for the garlic rolls or the marinara that was served with them.

The prices were reasonable and it is close to home, so I will probably give them another try, as everyone can have an off night.  I would rather spend the extra drive time to go to to one of my other favorite pizza spots, but this place will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Love their pizza, ordered the pepperoni with feta cheese pizza and just a cheese for the kids. Don't forget to try their garlic knot bread soooo good. It's something about the gravy on the pizza that makes it so delicious! Try it and you'll know what I'm talk'n about. We love their two for Tuesdays can't beat that. They are very friendly and the crust is crisp too can't forget about that. Fast service, we like to pick it up so we order it drive there and it's ready ."}
{"text":"First time in was 3 days ago and I've been back everyday since ! Honestly went in to check it out because I love Pizza and ended up falling in love with the place. Stephanie was awesome and so was the Pizza guy. I believe his name was Ricky or Mikey"}
{"text":"Excellent!! The stromboli is money!! The wings are on point. I hope the open up to more area to deliver!"}
{"text":"Stop by for Wings Wednesday.
Decor:Nice. Modern
Staff: Friendly. The register girl very friendly and attentive.

                           They all greeted me when I walked in. Friendly atmosphere.
Food: Wings. Excellent. I'm usually picky about my wings. 

Return visit: YES!

Overall this is great place. Alternative to Centennial shopping center (24 hr fitness/In+out/Smash Burger. 

Location: 1 mile from Centennial shopping center. Ann and Centennial."}
{"text":"We love this place great food and service long time customers and we recommend to our friends. Best wings and sauces. The stromboli is excellent as well. Joe & Connie S."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat. Staff is friendly. Two slices of cheese pizza with a drink for $5.99. They always have flavored water free of charge. Try them"}
{"text":"I tried their Spaghetti & Meatballs and also a Pizza.  The pizza was not good, the crust was like cardboard.   The Spaghetti & Meatballs was not bad, but not great.  The plus was the meatball was ENORMOUS, but it was a little rubbery in texture.  Not sure if that means it was microwaved or not.  The place is kinda cute, and the people seem nice, so I do wish them the best.  The most critical thing for a pizza place is a good pizza with a good crust, so perhaps they can work on that."}
{"text":"This is good pizza. This is really good pizza. Above the Crust knows how to make a heart attack taste amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place. The pizza is amazing. The staff is always friendly. Anytime I'm on this side of town I make sure to stop in here for a slice or two. I only wish I lived closer so I could come here more often!"}
{"text":"Extremely delicious!!! The pizza and the chicken strips in the honey bourbon sauce is a must try."}
{"text":"This pizza has no right to be this good. I basically never write reviews for food places but the cashier who may have been the owner or something was ridiculously friendly and even gave me a free drink while I waited for my food. 

The actual pizza tastes amazing and has the perfect crust size for me.

So many italian places have opened up in that exact location but this is the first one ive been to that is worth your dough."}
{"text":"We ordered from the location off Ann and the 95 quite a few times before this one opened. This location is right down the road which is fantastic. We love the pizza and find it's great every time. We always had trouble finding a good pizza place in the area that was consistently good. We've legitimately tried every pizza place that delivers to us. This place definitely fits the bill with great pizza, from the cheese to the toppings to the crust. The chicken wings are also amazing. Super crispy and delicious sauces. It's now our go to pizza place and we may or may not order from here about once a week."}
{"text":"My wife was craving this place so we drove 20min to get a bite to eat. We got there around 8:30 the place closes  at 9:00 so we ordered our food hoping we had enough time to eat we got our food around 8:45 and since  it was closing soon we decided to eat outside. One of the employees (Male with dark hair. We didn't get his name) that was cleaning came outside and told us that we had 10 min to eat. We all thought he was joking. So 10 min went by we were half way through our meal the same guy told me, my wife, 5 yr old son and my 2 friends that WE HAD TO GO BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSING. I thought it was a joke but he just kept on repeating himself also asking for our chairs and tables how horrible and awful!!! Mind you we were still sitting in them!! It's not like we were hanging out we were ALL still eating. I've NEVER experienced someone kicking me out because they are closing I WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  Stopped by on my way to work and thought I would give them a try.  They have good deals and are fast.  Best pizza I have had in a while, as I like thin crust.  Their's was really good.  Large is very big and they explained how to get the best deal on the 3 toppings.  I will be back to try the other items, as they have many on the menu.  Definitely give them a try - I believe you will like them.  Plus, they are friendly and kind too."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this neighborhood pizza place right when they opened and was not impressed. We have since tried most pizza places in our area and continued to not be happy: soggy crust, bottled ranch dressing, crappy service, cardboard tasting pizza. I know it sounds like we are picky, but truly we're not. After our friend/hairdresser, Rachael Jackson, owner of Backstage Salon swore to us that Above The Crust was worth another try so we ordered. And boy am I glad we did. Great service from the ordering process to our sweet upbeat delivery driver. The pizza was perfectly done; sauce that had actual flavor and fresh toppings yum! We also ordered the fried zucchini which came with marinara sauce that was excellent and homemade ranch dressing! The zucchini was also perfectly done and plentiful. Now we feel like jerks for snubbing this awesome place! Can't wait to try other items on their menu and glad to find a great neighborhood pizza joint we can call our own."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great pizza, wings and LOVE the garlic knots.
The owner and employees are fantastic and super sweet."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in Above the Crust. I have literally turned about 50-75 people onto this place and the past few times I've been disappointed. This time ... Sunday night special ... the pizza was old and the crust was not tasty at all. The wings were mushy and the medium sauce was lacking. I asked for celery but received none. Looks like I need a new place to frequent and recommend."}
{"text":"First off I love this place because of the community outreach after one of their employees passed away. This was the main reason we decided to try Above the Crust for our weekly Friday night pizza dinner. We absolutely loved the pizza! The staff was so friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. I enjoyed the atmosphere inside it was very clean and cool which is a must need to escape this vegas heat. This place is a MUST TRY"}
{"text":"This place treats the minors who work for them horribly. Frequent screaming contests right in front of customers. Also, the pizza is sub-Little Caesar's."}
{"text":"The pizza was perfect. The crust was great and the toppings were fresh.  The garlic rolls are amazing. The staff is friendly and the décor is inviting."}
{"text":"Been hearing great things about this place and decided to come check it out! Food smells amazing & customer service is awesome! Two thumbs up for sure! We will be back!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Normally my family orders from Sabatino's pizza, but due to poor service and inaccurate orders we decided to try something new. This was our first time trying Above the Crust and we are not impressed. We ordered a Philly cheesesteak sub, The Original stramboli and chicken wings. The food was tasteless and all of the bread was tough. Chicken was thin and had barely any sauce on our mild wings. Maybe we will give it another chance but will shop around before coming back."}
{"text":"Thsi pizza place is good. Lunch sandwiches are excellent. We had been looking for a new pizza joint since \"northend pizza\" is a total fail now! Nice & clean atmosphere. Owner was very nice and welcoming!"}
{"text":"The staff is amazing and food is fantastic! I love their hot wings and their cheese pizza is to die for! And their garlic rolls are some of the best in Vegas. Everyone that works at this place is extremely genuine and friendly, it really is a great atmosphere. This place is as good as it comes, friendly people and spectacular food. You can't beat Above the Crust, trust me!!"}
{"text":"This pizza joint and I go waaay back. And over the years the food has been consistently good. This spot used to be a Villa Pizza. And it seems like the recipe has been passed on or maintained through out the years as it's changed to what is now.. Above the Crust. Just stopped in for A quick snack and got some fries. The places smells amazing and has quite a bit of seating. There are also some TV's with sports and news playing if you're just there for the slice and a soda deal. Another staple of this place.. since the mid 90's there has always been a slice and a soda deal. The size of the slice is often really huge; there are seasons and parmesan at the end of the pick up counter to dress up your pizza before you walk out. When I did eat cheese pizza this was always the preferred spot. The prices are what they should be and there tail gate options and combos are a good price also. Oh and don't forget the ranch on the side. The space is always clean the the staff is friendly, helpful and attentive... and sincere; which is extremely rare these days. I definitely think you should try it out!"}
{"text":"Just came in to get some chicken wings mild some fries and a medium drink Adam bring my food over very nice and courteous stablishment was very clean and I will return"}
{"text":"Love this place it is a 7 mile trip for us and worth the ride. Have been going here for 6 mo now. We have never  had any thing that wasn't great.Friendly Service they are right on top of it from taking your order to the delivery. The best cannoli in town. My wife is a Italian and swears by there food. The girls that work there are very nice and always smiling. We highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The BEST pizza in Las Vegas. Fresh toppings on a pizza prepared to perfection. The owners, Adam and Phyllis are so sweet and generous. Great prices, excellent service and you will not leave this place hungry!!!

Deep fried Stromboli...WHAT!!! It is absolutely unreal. A regular menu item but if you want it deep fried you have to request this preparation method. The other photo is fried pizza dough that is out of this world! I call it fried dough w/powdered sugar & butter deliciousness!!! Not on the menu but they will gladly make it for you."}
{"text":"Here's an updated review To the business comment given on my previous review:
I'm sorry but the next time you decide to call your customers liars, at least make sure you have your facts straight. Here's my receipt & with the specific instructions...or is that not your business name above? You might had also forgotten your words and that's why you don't recall. & yes, when I called to fix My mistake I was told it would take an additional 1hr 1/2 to deliver my order. Without hesitation I agreed since it had been my mistake. In addition, I payed the additional delivery fee. Even with all this I still had agreed to give it another try, but now that I see that your customers are not your priority. You have Definitely lost my business."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, got the family special. Friendly and quick service!
40 wings (4 flavors) , large pizza, garlic knots and 2 liter out the door before I could blink."}
{"text":"This is a nice neighborhood pizza place.  We have been looking for a decent pie since North End changed hands and went way down hill.
The staff is friendly and they do a pretty good version of an East Coast Pie.  By East Coast I mean NY, CT, NJ.
We have not tried their Sicilian pie yet but it looked good the other night.
I reserve 5 stars for places like Santarpio's in Eastie so this is my highest rating for ah-beets in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, could have done without the loudmouth lady worker in the back airing her personal business though."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and couldn't wait to try this place.. that was my first mistake, I should have waited a long LONG time ;)

Firstly, the restaurant is located in a small strip mall with some funky parking.  Went in, was impressed with the cleanliness and it certainly smelled wonderful.  Hubby was hungry, so he ordered the chips and dip, 2 garlic rolls, and a large pizza.. I quickly changed it to a small pizza, and I'm doubly glad that I did.

Chips and dip arrived - hubby thought they were both fantastic.  I thought they were good, but hardly \"life altering\".  The chips are homemade, no salt on them, and fried until hard.  They're too thick to be called crispy.  The dip was called Ranch and it was all you tasted.. Ranch dressing.  If there were other seasonings in there, they were lost.

Then the pizza arrived, and we reminded the guy about our garlic rolls.  He quickly returned with 2 foil wrapped rolls.  Hubby opened his and tasted it immediately.. then set it down and never picked it up again.  He said it was cold and boring, so I didn't open mine at all - not going to waste time on something that bad.

The pizza toppings were fresh and the crust was crispy.  Not thin, not thick, but sturdy.  However, the sauce had virtually no seasonings to it - a frozen pizza generally has more flavor than this did.  There was a shaker of oregano and another of garlic located with the shakers of pepper flakes and dried parmesan cheese.. once those were added, then it was okay.  I have serious issues with a pizza that has to be seasoned afterwards.. isn't that the cook's job?

I had one slice, hubby had two.. and we tossed half the small pizza as not worth saving.

On a plus note, the fountain coke tasted great ;)"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I've ever had ! The chicken fingers are soooooo good I'm so inlove ! Pizza is my favorite especially their pizza !"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Food is great!  And the girls are awesome! Some of the sweetest girls you will ever meet.  :)"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery last night. It was edible, but I've had better. If there is a next time I will not order spinach in my calzone. It was like they balled up frozen spinach , squeezed the water  out and threw it in. No seasoning, it was barely warm. It tasted gross. Once I removed the spinach ball from the calzone, it was decent.
We also ordered a buffalo chicken pizza along with buffalo chicken fingers. That pizza was a disappointment because it was only a cheese pizza with cut up buffalo chicken fingers on it. Where's the blue cheese crumbles? The side of hot sauce? It was just so-so. The crust was good. 
And why is there no web site with a menu?
Sorry, but it's aight...."}
{"text":"Low grade pepperoni. Low grade pepperoni is flat and very oily when baked on pizza. First trip to Above The Crust tonight and had pepperoni. Flat & oily. White pizza was fair. Not much mass to these pizzas. Two large pizzas were $45 and not much there. I think I'll stick to Red Rock Pizza. Paul at Red Rock is a NY transplant and makes his own dough daily and uses high quality pepperoni. They curl up when baked and are not oily... 

AND THEN THE OWNER PHYLLIS WRITES AND BERATES ME SAYING SHE DOESN'T APPRECIATE THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK AND THAT COMPARING HER FOOD TO A RESTAURANT WITH A HALF A STAR LESSER RATING WAS UNFAIR. Ms. Phyllis the proactive and reasonable customer service answer is, \"Thanks for the feedback Mr. Customer. We'll will address your concerns in order to ensure our customer base\". But alas, there is obviously no room for improvement according to Ms. Phyllis. But then she's not the paying customer is she? Good luck with that position madam. Meantime, your pepperoni is oily, there's no mass to these skinny pies for my $45, and our first time in was our last time in."}
{"text":"Thanks to yelp I found this cool pizzeria ! Clever name and pretty good pizza. I wouldn't say it's the best , because it's not freshly made. But I was satisfied , they had fair prices and awesome lunch deals. The owner was very nice and welcoming.


UPDATE : I didn't tell y'all that the girl serving me pizza ate pepperonis off of the pizza. Wtf girl !!! Get it together. Please ....... Who raised you????"}
{"text":"The food was really good and we got an extra slice of pizza for free! Will order from here again!"}
{"text":"On a first road trip with my girlfriend, we decided to start our alphabet restaurant game with going to Above the Crust.  My girlfriend found this place on Yelp and saw that the reviews were very good.  They are known for their pizza.  However I was not in the mood for pizza, so I ordered chicken tenders and fries.  They were very good.  We spoke to the proprietor for a little bit.  He was very friendly.  Overall, the taste of the food, service, and friendly atmosphere was all great."}
{"text":"Really really good pizza !! And i usually don't like pizza  can't wait to try other stuff"}
{"text":"Best pizza within a 15 mile radius and actually tied for best overall in Vegas in my opinion. The sauce is just sweet enough with a perfect blend of cheeses. I have also had the wings and fingers--- amazing and I am very picky about good hot fingers.  They have great specials that they post on Facebook. The large pizza and wings for 24.99 was an amazing deal. The pizza was too big for the box and the wings were plentiful. They give tons of homemade ranch and even threw in some garlic knots. It's best eaten there but even to go this is the best pizza I have had in a long time and certainly the best in northern Vegas!  My only slight complaint is the outer crust can sometimes be very crunchy while I prefer it a bit chewier but still delicious and not enough of a concern to lose a star. You NEED to try this place :)"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza,salad and bread. Oh wait.... the Italian nachos you must try... So good!"}
{"text":"I have ate here several times. Every time has been friendly service, clean and great food. My favorite is the buffalo wings, but there pizza and Italian nachos are good too.  The store is kind of small but cozy. Can be loud at time because its an open kitchen. Over all I give it a thumbs up..."}
{"text":"Just finished my lunch and i have to say I'm very satisfied. I had the spinach calzone and it was pretty big. Probably the biggest calzone i have ever had. I'd say share it because it can definitely feed two people. The Calzone was cooked very well. It was not too hard or too soft. The mozzarella and ricotta cheese were very delicious. I'm very impressed with this place, considering it just opened. 
Their customer service was amazing! One thing I always notice is customer service. I was greeted immediately and their cashier was very attentive and very friendly. She checked up on me a few times and made sure i had enough marinara for my calzone.
The wait for my calzone was not very long. I will definitely bring some friends with me next time because i do want to try the pizza and the wings! Give them a try if you are nearby!"}
{"text":"We love their N.Y. Style Pizza and everything is made with love. They also have the best meatballs in town. This is my go to place when I'm looking for a good pizza, wings, subs, etc."}
{"text":"Yelp FAIL!  I had a pregnancy craving for pizza. You know, like new York pizza not pizza hut's pan crust. Looking at reviews and pictures hubby went and picked up pizza from here. Wish we didn't. Waste of $16! Now the thickness of the dough was good. BUT nothing had flavor. Sauce was flavorless. Dough was flavorless, and somehow even the cheese had no flavor! The only thing that made this place bearable was there extremely flavorful ranch. But pizza should be enjoyed with or without ranch. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Paid $25 for a pizza with all bread and no cheese/sauce. Good thing I had water to help wash it down. It had potential had it had an adequate amount of toppings to go along with the thick Sicilian crust."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i came by to check this place out right after we opened. My boyfriend was nervous because the previous pizza place there was horrible but our experience there blew us out of the water! Great food, great people and great specials!"}
{"text":"Been happily ordering pizza from Above the Crust for a few years now. There have been a few pizza shops in this location but they failed likely because their food wasn't any good. Our family had stopped ordering food all together from 3 previous pizza shops because it just wasn't good. Well ya can't go wrong now! The pizza is so good and the baked ziti tastes homemade. You keep making food and we'll keep ordering. Finally a neighborhood pizza spot we can order from."}
{"text":"I had a serious craving for mozzarella sticks this past weekend. I was going to my parents house and this place popped up with 4 stars and a mile away. I called in an order of sticks, and added a slice of pepperoni. My total was like $12.

I like that they sell pizza by the slice. However the slice I got was cold and barely reheated. The cheese wasn't even melted. I had already brought the food home otherwise I would have said something. Even after I warmed up the pizza, I didn't think it was very good. The mozzarella sticks were pretty good, and came 12 to an order. The sticks came with marinara and ranch. I gotta say my favorite thing was the ranch. It was thick and garlicky, and you can tell its house made. I definitely wanna come back and try their wings because they have like 10 different flavors, but I dont think I would come back for pizza."}
{"text":"My son saw the sign announcing their 2 slices and a drink special for $5.95 so he wanted to try it because he loves pizza. Even has a saying that even if pizza isn't great it's still pizza, but this is amazing pizza! He loved the two slices with pepperoni and we also had two garlic rolls that were just divine so good when dipped in the marinara. The men's restroom was also very clean I don't know about the women's since I didn't go in there. Highly Reccomended"}
{"text":"Sooo good! The pizza here is AMAZING. Plus their lunch special is a GREAT deal. Two huge slices of pizza with a soda for $5.95??? YES PLEASE! Their garlic nots are delicious and the perfect amount of garlic for this garlic lover! And the owner is So nice! Will definitely be back here every chance I get!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Pizza is always delicious - I tend to only order cheese or 1 topping as extra toppings always make pizza soggy ans fall apart. Their chicken tenders are delish!

The people who own/run this place are great- always friendly!! I don't know the gentleman's name who usually does our delivery service, but he is the sweetest man ever!! I don't believe enough people give the delivery service enough credit.

BTW - Tuesdays are what we call \"twofur\" Tuesdays! Buy one large pizza get 1 free!"}
{"text":"Damn good pizza. $26 for a large 3 toppings with extra cheese. Pricey...but damn good."}
{"text":"Good NY style pizza. No, it isn't exactly like NYC pizza but it's a lot better than going to a chain. The Italian wings are really tasty too! They also have good daily specials. If you're on the NW side of town, check it out."}
{"text":"The food was beautiful and tasty. With a family of five it's hard to find a delivery place that gets the order right, on time, and looks great. Well this is our new go to. Had the Asian zesty wings, philly cheesesteak with the homemade pasta and a large pepperoni pizza. For thin crust out on delivery this was outstanding. Only thing was the fries very delicious as they were but I prefer more seasoning salt on mine. I added it from home."}
{"text":"Well we have all eaten at a bunch of pizza joints right. I must have driven past this place a hundred times. So I stopped in with the wife and ordered a calzone and this nacho looking thing. 
That's all I should have ordered. It was amazing. It was fresh cut potatoes in to chips then topped with cheeses and meats. They make there own ranch and its the best ever. 

I'll be back again and again"}
{"text":"Soooo good! Pizza, wings, garlic knots and the ranch! Omg it was all so fresh and delicious! If you want authentic pizza and bomb wings with that good restaurant ranch, go here!! You won't be disappointed! I've been to both locations and they're both awesome! Definately my go to place for pizza and wings!"}
{"text":"best pizza around las vegas they always do a great job everything is cook just right if you have not tried them you are missing a WHOLE LOT... stop by and get a pie!!!!!!!!! you won't be  disappointed"}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to check this place out this evening with my meetup group the Las Vegas Pizza Posse. I had heard about the pizza and just had to try it for myself, and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. Some places slather on way to much sauce and it drowns out the other flavors as well as making the crust almost inedible, but not this place. Let's start with the crust (since that's where all pizza begins), just the right amount of doughyness and crispy outer edge, that perfect flavor that melds with the sauce, the cheese and just the right amount of toppings for that explosion of flavor in your mouth. I happen to be a real bacon nut, and I have to say I'm not sure what kind of bacon they use, but it sure was full of flavor, and pieces the size that when I bit into bacon I tasted bacon, not everything around it but the bacon. The service tonight was really good, they definitely know how to take care of their customer. One little extra is the fact that you can stand at the glass and watch as they make your pizza, not always important to some people, but I really like the fact they don't disappear into the \"magic kitchen\" and come out with the piping hot pizza. This is a GRRREAT place for taking a small group of say 10 to 14 people (we had 13 and no problem with seating for everyone), so if you're looking for a place to take your friends, family or co-workers be sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"i found out from a fellow yelper that this family owned pizza joint was under \"new\" original management. 
it's around the corner from my gym so why not give it a shot cuz everyone needs their favorite pizza joint close to their home that delivers, right?
i'm so glad i did because this is my new favorite pizza place.

their dough is delicious with the perfect amount of salt, yeast and water making for a nicely risen, chewy, tasty base for all of their offerings.

the first time we ordered delivery, we had 2 small pizzas - ac special (pepperoni, sausage, shrooms, peppers, onions) and a plain cheese - and a spinach calzone.
the hubby and i like our pizza well done with easy sauce.
about 30 minutes or so later, we received our piping hot delivery and everything was prepared to our exact specifications.

we've since dined here several times and each time have been extremely satisfied.
we sure are glad that this pizza joint is back to its best and that it's so very close by."}
{"text":"Going for the most objective review possible here. Maybe an average of 4 stars for this place means we just came on a bad day? Then again, when you're using bread roll dough from a can to make your \"garlic knots,\" where can I really start? 

Their self-admitted frozen zucchini coins and mozzarella sticks (we tried the latter of the two) with premade marinara and ranch dips were probably the best things they serve. Then again, I can always grab a box from the freezer section at the store and do the same at home.

We ordered the Greek specialty pizza, which is listed on the menu as having spinach, (black) olives, feta, and mozzarella. What they fail to mention is that it's a white pizza - one with a cream sauce instead of marinara. This made it very difficult to eat, extremely salty, unbalanced, and more like overdressed cheese bread than anything else. The crust reminded me of one you'd get from the grocery store freezer section as well. 

Took the remaining pieces (there were 6 out of 8 left from our ravenous group of 3) in two small pizza boxes to give to the homeless on our way home.

I wish I could say that the price point or service was their saving grace, but that would be a lie. They open at 11am on Sundays, we came in at 2pm and the chairs were still atop all but ones of the tables. The woman who took our order seemed nice enough (this is the only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1), but is absolutely lacking knowledge about the kitchen in which she stands and was nowhere to be seen the majority of the time that we were there.

Well, they made an attempt, albeit half-assed, at opening a hip pizza place. My tip? A little more quality and time put into making the food yourselves will go a long way. Until then, this was our first time there ... and our last."}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza joint now. I love the sauce and of course the doughy crust is the best. ...for me."}
{"text":"My coworkers brought this for lunch one day and I couldn't stop looking at their food. I had to try this place for myself. One Tuesday I decided to order and realized it was bogo pizza. So we got 2 for the price of one. Awesome deal. 

We got pepperoni and it was amazing. Definitely one of my favorite pizza places now. 

I went inside to pick it up and everyone working there seemed happy and greeted me right away. Even better! I can't wait to order from them again."}
{"text":"Above the Crust has been my favorite go-to pizza place since moving to this side of town a couple years ago.  I always get the plain cheese because it's just that good.  I also discovered they make their own ranch and I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best I've ever had.  I've ordered it so much, I now have a full jar in my fridge.  On top of delicious food, the staff is nice, delivery always fast and prices fair.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat in Las Vegas!! The pizza, cheesesteaks, strombolis are all delicious!! They have great weekly specials and their customer service is beyond amazing!! From the managers to Veronica who delivers it is such a pleasure everytime we order from here!!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Giant side of fries, good service by the cashier ! I will definitely come back to this place , pizza was great !!"}
{"text":"Very expensive delivery pizza $35 for a pizza and 2 liter of coke- the owner said I would be so impressed and that it would be my favorite place- uhhh, not at all!!!"}
{"text":"I am displeased. First of all, I paid 15 dollars for a small pizza. I ate that shit in two bites. Second, the chicken wings were whack. Chicken skin was not crispy at all. The ranch was saving the meal and then we found a hair :("}
{"text":"We are there nearly weekly. Pizza is fresh and crust is crispy which I love. Their wings and fingers are excellent as well. Priced good and employees are friendly."}
{"text":"The baked ziti pizza is amazing!We order from here quite often and decided to try one of the specialty pizzas and it was delicious!They have great food overall and they've always been nice and friendly whenever my wife or I go pick up our order"}
{"text":"Great food.  Great quality pizza.  Especially love the cheese they use.  Not super greasy due to the high quality cheese.  Friendly staff.  All you could want in a pizza place."}
{"text":"Great pizza! We found this place when we were getting our cars worked on at the shop next door. The two slice special is awesome! The lady even remembered us from the last time we came through. Great customer service and the pies are yummy!"}
{"text":"They have really good deals through out the week which made me try this place for the first time . Everything was delicious we will be back and the workers were very friendly:)"}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing biggest calzones I've  seen! It's super clean and the staff is very friendly. Has a very mom and pop kind of feel so it's really cute! Food was fantastic and they have really great deals! For sure coming back for a slice or two!"}
{"text":"While my car was being serviced, I decided I could use a bite to eat. In the area it was only one place, Above the Crust. I had a previous positive experience with them a few years back, while I got my nails done at Nail Bar... which is next door. My son got wings and he was able to purchase them himself! I thought that was pretty cool because he must have been about 7 years old at the time so that shows patience in the staff. 
Well today. It was really just blah. I felt like the staff was low key rude. For example the girl passing out the food asked how every one was doing except me. She also seemed to make it a point not to say thank you. Overall the environment was unprofessional the staff was actually eating, socializing and playing around with each other as I patiently waited for my salad.Smh.
So the food... not many healthy choices. I was limited to salads. However some one said that the Salads were good here. I disagree. The salad was gross. The chicken was old, and cold. I asked the girl who passes out food if the chicken was fresh, she claimed it was but it wasn't. It was vile. Almost as if it were old meat that was cooked. The salad dressing was nasty. Chipotle ranch, ewww . The veggies in the salad were blah, but at least they used spinach and arugula. However nothing was fresh as promised  very disappointed and I ended up very hungry because I could not eat the salad enough to satisfy any hunger pangs. Soooooo nasty .
I hear it's a new owner now and the Salads haven't been the same since. Well mine was gross and I won't dare try again."}
{"text":"I was working from home this past week and to get some fresh air I decided to stop by this shop for a slice of pizza. Being my first time here it was very easy to find, very clean and plenty of seating. The staff was friendly and suggested the many lunch specials they had available (which were really great specials). I chose the 4 chicken finger lunch special (with fries and soda) and a slice of cheese pizza. It took about 10 minutes for my food to be ready and it did not disappoint! The chicken was cooked well and juicy, fries were seasoned well and the pizza was delicious!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, family owned, nice atmosphere and great service! 
The pizza is delicious and you can even order online or order with your phone. The consistency of the pizza is just right, I personally do not like grease pizza and I like this one, it is really good. Will definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"Quality has went down tremendously the last few times I've ordered. The latest has me seriously doubting trying Above the Crust again. I placed an order around 6:30pm. Nothing shows up for a while so around 8:10pm I call the restaurant and am told my order is out for delivery. The driver finally arrives at 8:40 with my food and it's lukewarm at best. A waste of $50."}
{"text":"I chose Above the Crust for my birthday dinner and I'm so glad I did! Wow! Can you say, \"Phyllis's meatballs!\"? We ordered the Family Special: a large cheese pizza(we added pepperoni and jalapeños), garlic knots with homemade marinara and more than enough chicken wings with homemade ranch that we are bringing some home. Plus we added a Caesar salad with homemade dressing and of course.....Phyllis's meatballs! A family owned business that greets you with huge smiles when you walk through the door, I couldn't ask for more but of course they go above and beyond with a dessert plate that satisfies my birthday sweet tooth! Thank Above the Crust for an awesome birthday dinner! I'll be back sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing! The calzone I ordered was probably the best calzone I've had in years. The outside was a perfect golden brown. Lots of cheese and pepperoni. It was massive! The Stromboli was very delicious also. The ranch dressing they make is so good. I will definitely be ordering from here again ASAP!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Im kind of particular about my pizza and this place has become my go to spot. I've also enjoyed their wings and fingers. Good portions for decent prices. It's a cozy little family owned place. I'm assuming the man I always see working is the owner and the girls that are working are his daughters. Very friendly people. I'd recommend anyone to try it."}
{"text":"For what we paid and based on the reviews, I was hoping for a tremendous experience with our pizza and wings. But, it fell very short.

This was our first time. Wife and I picked up a small AC Special pizza and 20 wings.   The pizza was ok, just ok. Nothing fancy. We could have gone to some other places in town and gotten a better, medium size pizza for the same price. Crust was ok, not bad, not burnt, but nothing to rave about. Toppings were ok as well. Did like the sliced sausage. However, I wish they put more on there than just a couple of pieces each. The wings, we think, are baked. Which is ok, but we like them crispy and fried. Wanted them medium thinking that they would have enough buffalo kick, but wish that they were more saucy and had heat. 

For a total bill of $35.00, and that was for pickup, I would have expected a lot more. I was really hoping this would be a great place for pizza and wings since there really isn't a decent place in this area, but no. As I stated to my wife after eating, I would have much rather have gone to Olive Garden for that kind of money. I know I would have gotten my $35 worth there. Think this will be a pass unless they come in with a really good deal."}
{"text":"Not a good experience at all. Customer service was awful. Everyone behind the counter was staring at me and whispering. The man at the register was very rude. He made sarcastic remarks to me which were completely unnecessary. Will not be going back for the dreadful pizza."}
{"text":"I adore their pepperoni garlic knots! It's just the perfect size.   
And their marinara sauce is dangerously delicious!  
Today, I had a huge appetite for the large meatballs & spaghetti.  
It was satisfying!
Definitely worth a try for a quick bite or a feast! 
Next adventure will be their wings."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the new location, I've been to their original location many times. My family loves their pizza and wings. New location is just as great as the first. Everything taste the same and their pizza is always delicious as well as the wings. Also a great plus is that the owner is super cool!! Thanks a lot! We will be coming back to this location again!"}
{"text":"Love their wings. Great customer service as well! With new ownership they seem to be running the same we have been regulars and live on Ann And cimmaron so this is very close."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up the other evening. They had a large 16 in pizza and baked rigatoni for $19.99. Seemed like a fair deal. Food was ready in about 15 minutes. Pizza was hot and fresh and the pasta dish was enough to feed 3 to 4 people.  Pizza was decent with solid topping distribution. Pizza sauce was ok, it could have had more flavor of herbs and spice I think it came out of a package or can did not taste house made.  Cheese was a decent quality and quantity. The true test of pizza is how does it taste the day after?...or cold. This was not the best day old pizza but not worst either. 

I would brand Above the Crust as real Las Vegas Pizza.  Yes Vegas is now on the map along with NYC AND CHICAGO.  It is a blend of these two styles along with a hint of beach pizza. Just like many other things and ideas in Vegas that are just bought, sold, ripped off, copied, and reinvented to create it's own superficial existence and rebranded as its own style. VEGAS BABY!

Overall Above the Crust was an OK pie, but just cannot compare to all those real mom and pop italian pizzaria's I grew up on in the midwest."}
{"text":"Great customer service! I gave this place an extra Star for their customer service! 

We ordered :

The Greek stromboli: it was delicious and the best out of what we ordered! It was packed with deliciousness and toppings

The original canzone: it wasnt the best. There was just too much feta cheese compared to the ham and pepperoni. It just got way too much for me to finish it. 

Garlic knots: these were good, but I wish it was a tad more garlic-y and buttery than it was 

Over all the food is just OK."}
{"text":"Just got 2 subs from here..a philly steak and chicken parm. Both came with fries and a nice container of yummy ranch dressing. Both subs were very tasty and we had a buy one get one free coupon so it was extremely affordable and they honored the coupon with no problem. We picked it up and it didn't take long at all. We will definitely be back...can't wait to try the pizza and Strombolis next time!"}
{"text":"What a great place. Above The Crust is like the little pizza diners seen often in New York and there food is good enough for the big apple, but I'm glad it's here in sin city. It's a counter service restaurant but if you're dining in they will happily bring your meal to your table. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and their food is delicious and fairly priced. They have different weekly deals and lunch specials to fit any budget. You can watch them cook your food on the open kitchen.
I ordered a garlic roll, a pepperoni roll, the meatball Strom boli and the Italian nachos. The nachos come on a big plate, house made sliced and fried potatoes. They are piled high with Genoa salami, pepperoni, and mozzarella cheese. They come along side a serving of ranch and marinara sauce. The garlic roll is flaky and warm and tastes great with the ranch, my favorite of the sauces, the pepperoni roll is the only reason they didn't get a five star. It's just as amazing as the garlic roll but the pepperoni inside was cold.
Last but not least is the meatball stromboli, it's about as long as my forearm, perfectly cooked, and dusted with parmesan cheese. The dough gives just the right amount of resistance to not get soggy and hold up to the perfectly melted mozzarella cheese, marinara sauce and meatballs that fill it. It has all the great flavors of a meatball sub stuffed inside a cheesey stromboli.
I think I'll come back tonight for the Friday pizza and wing deal."}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about Above The Crust!! My family and I decided Pizza on a cold Friday night sounded perfect and I'm glad we did decided to try a new joint. I'm telling you, this place is one of the best pizza places I've been to in a very long time!!

The vibes inside make you feel like your at your Aunt or Uncle's small town restaurant. The board games for families to enjoy are a very nice touch. My daughter and I played pictionary while we waited and it added some quality time to our meal!

The food itself was exactly what I was hoping it would be! We're a small family of three so we ordered a stromboli and BBQ chicken pizza which were both more than enough to leave us all feeling full. The small pizza was $14.99 and was plenty for two people. The sauce on the BBQ pizza was the perfect amount of sweet and not too tangie. The chicken was quality meat and very flavorful. The crust was thin but not ttoooooo thin. It was crispy but not hard to chew!! Ill honestly say it was perfect. I wouldn't have changed one thing about our meal which means !! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My husband's from Jersey and he said this is the closest you are going to get to New York pizza in Vegas. Friendly staff, hot food made right then for you, not over-seasoned. Prices are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Found this place after a game at Centennial High School. It's a cute hole in the wall place. Food was good-above average and the employees were very accommodating. The cost was less than $100 for 11 of us (mostly teenage girls)!
We had a lot of left overs so I was pleasantly surprised. Give it a try - it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Stromboli. I've had both the original Stromboli and the meatball Stromboli a couple of times, and they're both amazing!  And huge! Easily two servings each."}
{"text":"I've been in Vegas for 2 years, looking for good pizza. FINALLY FOUND IT! Both their traditional pizza and Sicilian are amazing!! And their homemade ranch dressing is phenomenal! The service is outstanding as well! My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Found a place where I can have a pizza that didn't taste \"commercially\". Lol We ordered a simple pepperoni and omg it was delicious! We also ordered some wings and chicken fingerz, this is my go to place for them. They were not soggy or small like the other places do. The chicken were fully cooked, crispy while the buffalo sauce is dipped on it. Totally worth the trip even for just chicken. Don't forget to ask for their Ranch, it's magical. Lol The restaurant is very clean. Customer service is great, they make you feel like you've known them for years! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Above the Crust has an outstanding menu. I am a hearty eater, but find it hard to consume the whole stromboni, the large delicious Antapasta Salad, and so many more excellent choices. The pizza is the best I have had since NY days. Thank you Above the Crust for your prompt service and fresh hot pizza and more."}
{"text":"I'm not really a pizza eater... But their gluten free pizza is delicious. And their wings are among the best in the city (probably because they have the best homemade ranch). The prices are high but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I ordered a 10\" pizza, chicken fingers, and French fries.The fries were still cold and very soggy. And the chicken fingers were still frozen in the middle. I was hoping at least a pizza would be good But I would much rather eat a cheap frozen pizza then have to eat that pizza again. I have no idea how this place got its good reviews.But from my experience I will never eat at this place again"}
{"text":"Horrible. Ordered for my team at work. Didn't even bring change. Sent the cook as a driver. Pizza was bland. The only thing good was the ranch."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!! Great food awesome staff they have it all."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place has as many stars as it does. The wings are dry smell like they're bad, so probably old oil, the pizza is greasy and cold, and the mozzarella sticks were cold. Pretty upset with the money I spent on this place."}
{"text":"The food is delicious ! Great fast service and good prices . Will definitely be ordering again . I wish they stayed open later !"}
{"text":"OMG... This has to be the best pizza I have had since going to Italy... The crust is crispy and full of great flavor. The atmosphere is chill and the service is phenomenal. I say this will be the only place I will ever get pizza anymore. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!!!! :-) :-) :-)"}
{"text":"I ordered a baked ziti with sausage personal pizza through Yelp's Eat app for delivery.  I was quoted an hour delivery time but it arrived piping hot within 30 mins!  The crust isn't truly NYC style (a little too thick) but it was good.  I would have preferred a little more tomato sauce since there was hardly any in the ziti, I will have to ask for it next time.  I wasn't too fond of the sausage so I only had a couple of them and threw the rest away.  I think next time I'm going to try the meatballs with the ziti.  I couldn't stop eating this, it was really good.  I haven't had baked ziti pizza in over a decade so I just had to order it when I saw it on the menu.  Maybe the regular slices are a little more NYC style so I'll try that next time as well."}
{"text":"I have had this pizza twice now and I wish it wasn't so far cause their buffalo chicken pizza is amazing. The garlic knots are SO GOOD and I have to say their cheese they use is, like, to....DIE....for... 

I wish I had photos to share of what my pizza and stuff looked like. Maybe I will just have to have it again and update my review haha

But seriously... if you live in North Vegas, make the trek over to Above The Crust. You won't be disappointed :D (I wish emojis worked.. I could better portray my excitement haha)"}
{"text":"This place is great!  They have a location down Ann we use to drive to to pickup pizza and are more than stoked they now have one that can deliver!  We've tried their pizza, wings, sandwiches and garlic rolls over the last year and love them all.  Ordered a baked ziti pizza and wings tonight and everything arrived piping hot and 10 minutes before the delivery estimate.  If you want good food don't hesitate!  We were going to try to take pictures but we were too hungry, we'll catch some next time."}
{"text":"We came here for a good salad and garlic bread,  unfortunately they have neither.  Salad was plain and had only lettuce and tomatoes and the garlic rolls tasted like bread,  without garlic.   Will not be going back to this place."}
{"text":"From New York and this pizza Is sooo good. My whole family really enjoyed it. We will be back again. Delicious."}
{"text":"Can you spell fresh? Because that is what their salads are! I had a grilled chicken salad with the chipotle ranch, and it exceeded my expectations! The chicken was fresh, the greens were fresh, and that wasn't even the best part! The staff was as friendly as could be! The girl passing out our food could not have been nicer. I asked her who made the salads and she said it was the owner, and I think that is the coolest thing! If I could give a 10 star review I would, I will definitely be recommending this place and especially the fresh salads with chipotle ranch!!!!"}
{"text":"My Husband had the Calzone. He said it was the Best he ever tasted, a good Bal of Cheese and Pepperoni. The Asian Zest wings were soo good, we ordered a bucket to go to enjoy for the Knight's Game. The fries are thick, with the right amount of salt. Everything is fresh and delicious. The garlic rolls was made with fresh garlic too, not that powder stuff other places use. Another delight was the Cannoli: sweet and savoury. Thank you Above the Crust, finally an Authentic Place to go and enjoy Good Food."}
{"text":"I consider myself a pizza guy, I eat it at least 2-3 times a week.  I thought I had tried all the pizza places in the area and then I stumbled across this one.  It was pretty amazing!  The salad dressings are homemade, the pizza crust was perfectly crisp, and the sauce was just right.

The garlic rolls were also perfect.  You should definitely try this place."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in town! I love the buffalo chicken pizza and the face that they serve you infused water while you wait."}
{"text":"Wonderful little find. Good New York-style pizza. We had pepperoni and mushroom, and they used fresh mushrooms. We had a garden salad with wonderful seasonal lettuce with a homemade creamy italian that had lots of garlic.  It was very tasty, and quite reasonably priced. They're not likely to win any awards, but we'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Everyone is so polite and helpful! We ordered the meatball Stromboli, all I can say is, WOW!!!!! It tasted amazing and was very flavorful. This is a great family place!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. Once my husband & I ordered subs; waited at least 15-20 minutes before they were served. Ingredients were sub-par at best (meatball sub & Italian sub) 
The other time I called to order a large cheese pizza. On Friday, Feb 2nd the woman wearing the #VegasStrong T-shirt was so incompetent & ridiculous it entirely ruined the experience. (Placed order around 5:30 ready at 6:20PM) Phone conversation goes as follows:
Me: large cheese pizza for pick up 
Her: ok! What's your name? 
Me: *spells it out for her* 
Her: phone number? 
Me: *states phone number*
Her: address? 
Me: this is for pick up. Correct? 
Her: you said delivery 
Me: no. I said pick up. 
Her: ok, what's your name? 
Me: *spells it out for her*
Her: phone number? 702...? 
Me: no. My phone number doesn't have a 702 area code. *tells phone number, again*
Her: ok what was your order?
Me: large cheese pizza 

At this point I'm ready to shoot myself in the foot. We go & pay for the pick up. Same girl that was on the phone offers us water cups. Granted, there was no water. Their soda machine was all out of whack & the syrups messed up. Believe me. I used to work in fast food & know when they need to get changed. 
Girl that was on the phone ALSO gave us the wrong receipt. 
ALSO she didn't even bother to check it our food was ready at time of payment so we waited in the restaurant for 10 minutes before realizing our food had been ready the entire time. Total BS."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Very low quality ingredients used. Little Ceasers has better pizza than this place. The pepperoni is so bad it tastes like the store bought pepperoni from Walmart, gross! And I love any kind of pizza so u know it's bad. The wings were ok I got mild but they were so dry... super greedy with the mild sauce.

Would I return ..definitely not."}
{"text":"I ordered  a gluten free pizza with jalapeños and mushrooms, Italian wings, and a side salad. Everything was SUPER good. The food came in a timely manner and was hot and fresh. Well definitely order from them again! So happy they deliver to my area!"}
{"text":"Service: I love the girls that work the registers they are always so nice and friendly! 

Food: I can't say much other than Yummmmmm! Pizza or calzone the food is always made to order and fast. This assures it's hot and fresh just the way yummy food should be!!!"}
{"text":"This place was not bad at all.  The staff that answered the phone were very friendly.  She offered the specials and made recommendations on the menu which I appreciated.  For a large 2 topping pizza and 10 wings the price was 32 and some change.  I thought it was fairly steep but heard good reviews. 

I got my pizza in an hour to my apartment.  They quoted 45 minutes so I was not too upset.  They warned me ahead of time it would be a while.  The pizza was delivered fresh and hot.  It was very tasty with fresh toppings.  New York style pizza.  The wings I would not recommend, they had this breading on them and taste like wings you heat up at the grocery store in the frozen section. 

Their ranch was a unique blend and very good.  I will definitely be back but will try the garlic knots.  Those are supposed to be good.  

My suggestion to the business, a little faster delivery and watch the price a little."}
{"text":"Great Stromboli and the Italian wings were much better than wing stop The Stromboli we're golden brown and crisp.  Definitely a place we will be back for.  The service was attentive and the people were very nice"}
{"text":"My first time to this pizza parlor and it is definitely worthy of my 5-Star review.  The establishment was very clean and the people I came in contact with were so nice, that would be the owner, the manager and the waitress.  The pizza and wings are absolutely delicious.  My entire family is really enjoying dinner tonight!  While I waited for my order the manager gave me a yummy garlic knot and soda.  I wish this place nothing but success and I will return again and again.  I have found my go to pizza place!!!"}
{"text":"OMG. This place is great. Being someone who is from the east coast I'm a big fan of New York style pizza. This place nails it. The crust is so good, the pizza is so cheesey and it's not greasy like most pizza places who claim to have \"New York style pizza\". Get ye cheese pizza and ask for their homemade ranch on the side (it is so good). Dip your pizza in the ranch and enjoy, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly family owned... I just got one of the best meatball sandwiches I've had in this city. Crusty bread, homemade meatballs, whole milk mozzarella and sprinkle of Parma on top. I got the pasta salad on the side. Delicious also. Maybe a little less mayonnaise, I'm not a big mayonnaise fan, I don't mind it on pasta salad to much though... different pepper variety pieces in the salad. Awesome choices. This place is Straight From New York. Everybody needs to come and enjoy. I just took another bite of my sandwich while I was writing this. Hard to put it down"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We have previously enjoyed pizza from the first location, but tonight we ordered from new location off Ann and Simmons. Pizza was not good..dry, tasted like cardboard, and little to no toppings. One pizza was supposed to have extra cheese, and definitely did not. Thought it would be a great addition to neighborhood, but no, we won't go back. Would honestly give less than 1 star."}
{"text":"Solid pizza and fingers! Crispy finger with tangy buffalo sauce definitely hits the stop. You can buy pizza by the slice or get a whole pie. Great lunch specials too. Definitely worth the stop to fix a pizza and chicken fingers cravings."}
{"text":"I was shopping at the nearby Centennial Center as I do pretty much every week and even though there are many food options within the shopping center, I was bored with those options at the moment. I decided to pull up places on the good ole yelp app and came across Above the Crust. It's on Ann Rd across from Painted Desert, so not too far behind Centennial Center. Deciding to give Above the Crust a try, I stopped in and placed a order. They have so many good deals going on each day! It being Tuesday meant that I could get a large pizza free with the purchase of a large pizza and toppings an additional $2 each. I went with a large cheese and a large pepperoni and added a couple \"Garlic Rolls\" priced at .95 cents each. I really liked the taste of the pizza and the sauce on it. The rolls had a nice garlic and butter flavor on the outside, the inside was a bit too much bread that was tough. I prefer a more traditional knot personally. When I walked in, I was greeted with a friendly hello from all the employees and I was given a menu and a flyer that shows the current daily specials offered. 

Sunday and Monday ($32.95) - Large pizza, bucket of wings, 4 garlic rolls and a 2 liter of soda.

Two for Tuesday - Buy one large pizza get one free.

Wing Wednesday (24.95) - Sampler bucket of wings, choose up to 4 flavors.

Friday Special ($29.95) - Large pizza and a bucket of fingers.

Stromboli Saturday ($17.95) - Large pizza and any stromboli. 

Daily special ($5.95) - 2 slices and a drink.

They offer delivery and also offer sandwiches, salads and calzones."}
{"text":"We decide to support local family owned business for a change, instead of supporting the usual pizza franchises that's recently been very disappointing. We we're hoping to find a really good pizza place but this did not meet expectations. 

We give the pizza itself 3 stars. We like that it's not too greasy. It's not horrible, just very average for a large 16\" 2 topping $20 pizza. It's overpriced for the quality you get. It's probably better to get individual slices or their BOGO specials to make it worth it. 
The wings and chicken fingers were also average bar food type. Nothing special. The fries we're very soggy. That was probably the most disappointing. The ranch dressing seemed a bit watered down too. Not as creamy as I would've liked. 
We prob won't be eating here again. On the bright side, the delivery person was very pleasant."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here many more times since my original review. Ask my jeans. The calzone really couldn't be better. Their ranch really does live up to the hype and their marinara sauce is the best. Good service, good food, good prices and they deliver."}
{"text":"great customer service & even better food. sauce is good & the meatballs are to die for. owner & staff are very friendly. and they have great specials through out the week. we will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"My husband is a diehard fan of Papa Johns pizza, but after bad orders continuously we decided to try out the local pizza scene.  After a few bad apples we managed to find Above the Crust! I really like their pizza and they are always good when we order from them.  We are very happy with the quality of pizza that they provide.  The pizza is well cooked and a bit thinner.(not thin crust) It reminds me of pizza that I've gotten in Naples Italy.  Very good and the dough is awesome!"}
{"text":"I just came in and had the best customer service I have had in a long time. There where two young ladies who where just the best. They came up to me asked me how I was doing. Took my trash before I even could. The pizza also tasted great!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service ... we continue to eat here ... enjoy the atmosphere"}
{"text":"So I loved the fried zucchini it was so yummy!!!!! Fried Mozzarella sticks average. Loved that they give you large sauce cups! Our pizza was fine I wasn't really impressed and I wanted to be so bad! We had veggie and added meatball. I wish I had tried the fingers or wings. Will definitely go back to try  them. I will leave the pizza for my husband and kids because they didn't have an issue with it."}
{"text":"The \"AC\" is a good pizza, hot or cold! Their pizzas are big too, I'd say 18 inches. I got take-out, so I can't say much for the \"full experience\" of dining in, but the restaurant was clean and modern, and the staff was friendly. Prices seem to be on the higher side, but you get a lot for your money."}
{"text":"We went there this evening and it was very good, not the best I have had but for the price very good.

We had two pizza's the buffalo chicken and the BLT. The Buffalo chicken was the best pizza of this type I have had. I never have cared for BLT Pizza's but this one was good.

We also had the chips and dip, that was excellent as well, the chip's weren't overly salty and the dip was very good."}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times now and the food is amazing!! We discovered the place when we had a calzone craving and didn't know where to go. Soo glad we picked this place! The pepperoni calzone was exploding with cheesy goodness! The spaghetti and meatball is enormous!! Seriously, the meatball is the size of a softball (it's a 1lb meatball!)!! The chicken parm Stromboli is so delicious! I've gotten it multiple times! This place also has garlic knots that are soft and tasty! The staff is super nice and we are really glad we found this place! We will definitely continue to come back a lot!!"}
{"text":"I'm from jersey and I grew up with real pizza. Above the crust makes me feel like I'm at home. Best ny style pizza in Vegas hands down. Amazing Sicilian pizza as well. These people care and it shows. Wings are also great and I got a cannoli and that didn't disappoint either. If I could give them 10 stars I would!!!!"}
{"text":"Not too long ago a friend went through a terrible tragedy. The Above The Crust Family organized a fund raiser that got the Las Vegas community together. It's awesome seeing a local business being part of the community and giving back.

I had ordered a large Sicilian and a double order of chicken wings and I was not disappointed. Both items were delicious and I will definitely be returning for more. 

The restaurant itself is pretty small, so if it gets packed it can be a pain to move back and forth from your seat to the soda fountain. Not complaining the size gives it that mom-n-pop vibe that you lose when you frequent larger chains. And family owned businesses usually mean they care about their costumers. And it showed."}
{"text":"The pizza is great.  The calzones are amazing.  The girls are sweet and they are convenient to get to."}
{"text":"Soggy bottom, that's the ultimate no no in my pizza loving eyes. The sauce, toppings. Everything else was good, New York style, tons of cheese. The soggy bottom completely ruined it though."}
{"text":"Well... it just wasn't good. Especially for the 30 some dollars I paid for large with pepperoni and spaghetti with (a) meatball.  Pizza was a bit tough (chewy? ) and spaghetti?  Container it came in was more than half empty.  One giant meatball (not hot through) and barely enough sauce to taste....and only 11.00.. (no garlic bread either)... nope. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Two words come to mind when describing this pizza...flavorless and lifeless. It's not often that someone has the genius idea to build a brick and mortar around gas station pizza, but this feller apparently saw that as a million dollar idea. 

The dough had zero air in it, and was half cooked. The sauce might as well have not been placed on it, as it was flavorless as well. Now comes the cheese...I'm guessing it's whatever Sysco's cheapest offering is.

After trying this bastardization of pizza, I now know why they give you a free pizza for buying one. Next time I'm in the area, I'll search for a pile of dog vomit to eat. At least I'll know that it has some degree of flavor."}
{"text":"Today was our first time eating here. Great pizza & great customer service. Tried the 2-slice promo (added meatballs) and it was fabulous. I think we've found our new neighborhood pizza joint. Can't wait to try the antipasto salad next time. Our only complaint is that we don't live closer..."}
{"text":"One of the best New York Style pizza's I have had in Vegas! I ordered over the phone and they estimated it would take an hour to deliver. It was dinner time so that's expected, but I got to my house in less than 30 minutes!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good but very doughy. If you like that you will like it here. If not then you won't. The pies have good flavor. Two slices here feels like ten slices elsewhere. I like that."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza and chicken tenders were amazing!!! WOW!! I was in from out of town visiting. I will definitely come back to Above The Crust when I am in Vegas again!!!"}
{"text":"Heard many great things so thought I'd check it out. Pizza was OK but not my preference. Garlic knots are like crescent rolls with chunks of minced garlic slathered on top. Marinara dipping sauce is rather thin and watery. Not a pizza I'm willing to spend so much dough on (pun intended). Not the place for me, but if you're on the fence give it a shot.. Maybe it's your style."}
{"text":"Family owned. Local Pizza. Plus it's not that far from my house 
I ordered the AC Specialty Pizza and we chose t dine in. First off the interior looks pretty damn nice. Floors were clean and they were actually utilizing a window guy to clean all their windows. Decorations match the theme. When we placed our order the cashier was very nice and very patient as we looked at the menu. The prep area and oven was very clean. The price was good for the quality. It took a few minutes before we got our pizza but that's because they made it from scratch. The pizza was brought out to our table and appearance, smell, and taste of the pizza was amazing! The jars of pepper, cheese, garlic, and oregano were all full and clean. At the end they even came to pick up after we were done.
Great quality, neatness, cleanliness, friendliness, good customer service.

First time here. THE FAMILY wasn't joking, it IS good enough for my family pizza


UPDATE: Ordered online and was not ready at the time of pick up only because of technical issues. But they handled it in a very professional manner and apologized. The pizza was STILL just as delicious. This is quality"}
{"text":"This is an Awesome place, pizza is great tasting, thin crust. The staff are very friendly. I highly recommend this place. Try the Asian Zest salad too."}
{"text":"I was having my car smogged at the near by garage. I was hungry and ordered a couple of slices of pizza. It was early and they had to bake one fresh. I thought great. Fresh pizza. Naturally it took a little time,  I didn't mind.  Fresh baked pizza was worth the wait. It was brought to me by a very grumpy guy. Possibly the owner. Who ever he was somebody must have craped in his corn flakes that morning.  The laby who took my order seemed very nice. I wish she was the one who delivered my meal instead of that grumpy dude. Well attitude no longer was the problem.  That fresh baked pizza I waited so patiently for tasted like cardboard. No flavor at all. It was hot , , just no seasoning. I put red pepper flakes on it then salt then Parmesan cheese. to no avail.
I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Above the Crust just opened up. It has really nice atmosphere, a couple tv's and friendly workers. We dined in but they also deliver. I am really picky about my crust but this was probably the best I have had that I can remember."}
{"text":"Local pizza with a gourmet attitude.
I ordered a Greek Pizza with Chicken and it was fabulous! The spinach was sauteed perfectly to blossom it's flavor, the chicken was moist and tender, and the cheese was a wonderful blend of mozzarella and feta.
This was followed by a fresh, hand made cannoli!
Great spot!!"}
{"text":"Love this place for inexpensive pizza and wings! Always good service where you can eat in or out. The food does not disappoint! Check out the daily deals!"}
{"text":"Very tasty!!! My boyfriend and I got the daily special, 2 slices and a drink for 5.95. You pick your toppings for .25 each. My bf got bacon and it was VERY bacony! I got mushrooms on one and Italian sausage on the other. The mushrooms were fresh but not quite cooked :/ but the sausage was fantastic! The garlic rolls were delicious and come with a side of marinara sauce, it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area, heard about this place from friends. Seriously can't go wrong -- Good Pizza, the BEST wings and fingers,  and awesome ranch! Always fast delivery."}
{"text":"The large pepperoni pizza was very good. It had a ton of cheese, good crust, and plenty of pepperoni.  It is nice and close; a bit pricey but better quality than the regulars like Pizza Hut, Dominos, etc.  I called in the order and it was coming out of the oven when I got there about 12 minutes later."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to finally have a great pizza place close by. My husband is extremely picky and he loves the pizza. I love the Stromboli. The staff is friendly. We've been here several times and it's great every time!"}
{"text":"Pizza was decent place was clean staff was good  garlic knots looked great but ours were cold bet they are really good fresh out the oven rather then reheated wings good overall nothing special won't be back"}
{"text":"Above the crust is a good place to have a good pizza and or stromboli. I highly recommend this restaurant the portion sizes are huge. and you do get your money's worth the Stromboli that I ordered was enough for two people maybe three very filling.. the food was great that I want more and more.. look forward to going back sometime soon. Feel free to follow me and or like my photos have a good day."}
{"text":"Tried them out tonight, i ordered a large pepperoni pizza, chicken fingers, zucchini fries, pizza rolls, and their nachos. Don't judge I know it was a lot of food! It was alllll good. Fingers could of used more sauce and they gave me garlic rolls instead of pizza rolls. I called them back and they fixed the problem. I will definitely order from here again, my family really enjoyed the chicken fingers!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza especially love the crust. Just like I was back home. They have amazing specials too. Make sure you try their calzones."}
{"text":"We just ordered the wings. I thought they were good but they didn't come with much sauce on them, my husband noticed and asked for extra. Once we added the extra sauce they were really good wings, plus I really loved the ranch, it was definitely homemade and yummy!"}
{"text":"I tried this place this week for the first time even though I have lived across the street for three years.  I had a meatball sub with a side of pasta salad in place of fries.  It was very good!  And to think I almost had a meatball sub at Subway.  This was way better- tasted very fresh, very good crusty bread, and good marinara although next time I will ask for extra marinara.  Next time I may also go with the fries.  The pasta salad was okay but maybe too oily or too much mayo in it for my tastes.  The girls who work here are very sweet girls."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just get hella high and want an amazing cheese pizza!


This is the place to go! 


Amazing every time and everyone is always so nice!

Always my go to place if I'm on this side of town and 
Not feeling any other pizza joint for quick pizza!"}
{"text":"No kidding, this has to be the best pizza hands down in all of Las Vegas.  It is a new business that replaced another spot next to Panda express. Did not expect what's behind the cool window painting on their exterior.  Once inside I was greeted warmly and the young lady even helped me make up a to-go plate.  I thought they would pull it off an already baked pizza, but noooo honey - My 2 pizza slices were made from scratch, yummy!!!  Thin crust and well seasoned without being too salty. Lots of pepperoni , one in every bite. I ate both slices so fast that I forgot to take a picture.  Oh well , I'll just have to go back to try more things on their menu and the pizza.   Prices are very reasonable. Their interior is beautiful with lots of seating to entertain large groups.  I will definitely bring out of town guest here.  Finally, a restaurant to be proud of with great food and customer service..."}
{"text":"Great ,friendly service. Garlic rolls are very tasty. Pizza was wonderful with ample toppings. I'm gonna try the stromboli next time as this place smells Italian, heavy with garlic!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is all about the CRUST! Everything they do is simple and delicious. Definitely suggest the buffalo chicken"}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed, the crust sucked and very greasy! Got a buy one get one free pizza and still a bit overpriced. I would go to hungry Howies over this place any day! So much for tryiging something new,also waited an hour for a pick up"}
{"text":"One of our go-to pizza places!  Whether you want to dine in for a quick dinner or lunch or order delivery or take out, this is a great pizza place for all options!  Their specials are the best!  For lunch, you can grab a slice and a drink.  For dinner, it's a pizza, wings, garlic rolls and soda.  The specials change daily on their website.  And I think the prices are very fair, if not cheaper than most pizza places in our area.  And the taste is great!  It's one of the few places our family can agree on."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and it did not disappoint. Pizza was delicious as well their calzones. And the staff was so friendly as well!!! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"There is nothing NY about this pizza.  I dont understand why all these yelpers gave this place such high marks.  My cheese pizza tasted like it was sitting out all day then thrown into the oven to heat up.  It tasted just like a frozen pizza.  Crust was thicker than typical NY pizza.  And the cheese and sauce were nothing special.

On a positive note, the cashier/waitress was more than willing to make us a new pizza when we told her we were not happy with it.  We opted out.  I really dont think there was anything they can do to make it taste better."}
{"text":"The owners know their stuff! The gal is from Brooklyn so she knows a good New York style pizza. You get a gooey, cheesy slice times two and a drink for 6 bucks and change. I just came here for a drink but that deal was too good to pass up. 

Take it from a guy who lactose intolerant. If you want a great, quality thin slice NY style this is the place to go. 

As I sit here in deep lament over my finished slices, my only regret was that I did not eat more. I couldn't, I'm lactose intolerant."}
{"text":"Staff are very friendly. Prices are reasonable. I only had the cheese pizza and it was pretty good. First piece was delicious, nice and thin with a crisp crust. The second piece tasted like it had pineapple juice on it. Both pieces came off the same pizza so I'm not sure why it tastes different. I would go back here if I was in the area, typical slice of pizza you'd buy on the streets of New York."}
{"text":"I agree with Anna, authentic pizza! I have been in Vegas for 25 years, from Boston, and this is the best pizza by far in Vegas!! It is consistent with their Ann Road location as well. Both restaurants are very clean and welcoming, and so are their employees. Their Italian sub is another favorite of mine, as the meats are as fresh as can be. This should be everybody's go to for quality and delicious food!!"}
{"text":"--- Updated after Sicilian received, April 26, 2018 ---

I ordered the somewhat pricey Grandma's Sicilian with 3 toppings with tip for a hefty $38-ish total (delivered).

It is quite possibly the worse pizza I have had in Las Vegas.

I am heartbroken. I took pictures of what appears to be a large square cracker with a little bit of dough and toppings over-cooked on top of it.

With Grand Pizza removing their vastly superior Sicilian from their menu, there are apparently no options for the north part of the Vegas metro area.

I'd get the calzone again, but I guess I will proceed with caution. I'm tempted to toss the whole pie, it's that bad.

--Final edit on this \"Sicilian\" travesty : my grandmother was Sicilian. I'm from New Jersey. I've had pizza in Italy, New York, and various other fine places... I did end up throwing most of this pizza in the garbage. I would like my money back. 

I won't post the pictures I took of it here as I'm sure the other menu items are worthy of the praise they've received (again, I loved the baked and fried calzones). No need to add insult to injury. This order was a mistake on my part.


--- Updated April 26, 2018 ---

Just checked, Grandma's Sicilian now visible on mobile and desktop web browser views on the online order menu.

I'm hoping this replaces the no-longer-available Sicilian from another local pizza place after they removed it from their menu. Given the calzone  from AtC (see the rest of this review) I've got high hopes!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. The Italian Sub was great! I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Ordered a salad and a couple slices with  pepperoni, jalapeño and pineapple. Pizza was very good - crust with a little crunch, not overwhelming sauce but a little sweet and spicy. Salad was giant and full of decent greens (no iceberg here!)"}
{"text":"We were undecided about where to go tonight. While sitting in the car I opened yelp and decided to call Above the Crust to find out if there had been an owner change as we've been to this location many years ago, but didn't care for it.   I'm so glad we called, we went in placed our order, just a large pie and I'm thrilled to say it's New York pizza made from real New Yorkers.  The pizza crust was nice and thin and it actually had a little grease which made it really feel like NY pizza.  Yes we will be back to try the rest.  The garlic rolls were good too, very tasty."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic pizza! I got a coupon in the mail for buy one large cheese pizza & get one free, cheese pizza was $16.00 but well worth it! You can add additional toppings for $2 each also.
The salad was fresh, not that packaged crap & their ranch was yum!
I'm excited to have a new pizza place near me! Delivery driver was very friendly too!"}
{"text":"This is now my go to pizza place. Quick, efficient and good pizza. They also have great specials."}
{"text":"Really great pizza!  Service is quick, quality ingredients, good value"}
{"text":"New to the Northwest part of town, we finally found our permanent pizza spot. There's so many to choose from and we're not too big on your average chain place like Pizza Hut. 

The first time we gave this a try, we were instantly in love. Everything tastes fresh and authentic, not too sugary or artificial. 


This is definitely a guilty pleasure for our family."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza and it was Not good if the pepperoni slices were any thinner you could read a news paper through and very expensive we don't plan on ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"I love their wings and pizza is pretty good with more than just pepperoni. Nice staff they do deliver but have not used it as of yet"}
{"text":"Took my son's in for some pizza. We ordered the Philly Cheese Steak Pizza. It surpassed my expectations by far!!! We will be back!!! Trust me the fat kid loves to eat.        


Sincerely the Vegas Fat Kid"}
{"text":"Pizza and wings were good. Giving 4 stars for forgetting our garlic knots and soda on our take out order."}
{"text":"We were driving by and noticed the banner. So glad we did. Service was great, pizza and wing were delicious. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was decent, though not good enough for me to return. Pizza seems to be a VERY personal kind of food, though. :)

If you live in the area or are in the neighborhood, you should give them a try. The food quality is good for pizza, and the service is very friendly. We walked in right before closing, and no one complained or hesitated to serve us."}
{"text":"Love this place! I always get the two slice special and the honey bourbon chicken fingers are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Above the crust has THE BEST calzones and Stromboli is VEGAS!! They are always fresh lite and absolutely above the norm. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for excellent service and excellent food! I haven't tried other items on the menu because I can not pull myself away from their Stromboli and Calzones. Large portion makes feeding 2 more than adequate. A++"}
{"text":"Found this place by chance and couldn't be happier! Excellent pizza. The crust was so crispy & delicious. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Anyone can make a pizza. This place has perfected it!  Perfect crust, fresh toppings, excellent customer service.  Kid approved!  Lunch special is excellent.  Two slices and a drink for $4.95."}
{"text":"I have been living on the side of town for three years and I can't believe it took me this long to finally try this place. Pizza is awesome. Service is great. Not much more you can ask for. Also the have a jukebox! :)"}
{"text":"Drove by twice before going I. If the parking lot has cars it probably not too bad!? So on my second attempt,we tried a pie of pepronni.  Also ordered the garlic knots. The place smelled good. I give this a fat fail. Pie was slop and not cooked. Garlic knot was horrible,again not cooked. When came home just down the block. Opened the box and dug right in. I was pissed and did not even give the dog a bite. I said off to Leno's it was the same distance as this place. Your best bet in Vegas is Leno's on Ann bit the are moving soon."}
{"text":"I have lived in Vegas for 2 years and have yet to find a great pizza joint close to my house. I honestly was not expecting such good pizza. Do yourself a favor and order a buffalo chicken and a Above the Crust supreme pizza. You can thank me later..."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood pizza place! Coming from the tri-state area, it is pretty difficult for me to find good pizza out here. This place, however, does not disappoint! I have had the pizza, stromboli, wings, subs and everything has been delicious. On top of the great food, the girls there are always so prompt and sweet. If you live in the area and haven't been here, you are missing out!!"}
{"text":"Now my favorite pizza place in centennial hills , I love all the pizza here but the difference to me is the Sicilian square pizza is the best . Customer service is excellent , always remember my name and my order . Also this always busy place is a great lunch stop for a quick slice ."}
{"text":"Great NY pizza. Just went off other yelpers about this place and had to try. Had the wings with bourbon sauce. They we hot and fresh, not overcooked and not drowning in coating. Owner is genuine and a leggit New Yorker. Service and food was fast. Just got the standard pepperoni pizza. Inhaled it down. Found out new go to pizza place. 
Thanks!!"}
{"text":"So glad they have this location now. So much better than the soggy pizza place that was there before."}
{"text":"This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant, their commitment to our community is greatly appreciated and love their daily specials! The Thursday special with pizza and baked RIGATONI is delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious wings here. I had the Italian flavored wings. Very friendly staff and clean store. Prices were competitive."}
{"text":"Just had delivery and we had the family dinner special large pizza and wings and garlic bred rolls and a 2 liter soda. Came to be $45 and change very good service and prompt delivery. Will order again . Pizza is thin crust my favorite ."}
{"text":"This place was great! The chicken cordon blue pizza was incredible. Long stringy cheese. Hot wings were superb."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had since I worked in a pizza place back east. I've been looking for a pizza like this for almost 20 years. After bringing our food home from the store, the fries we added stayed nice and crispy for the duration of the meal. No soggy fries here! We got the Sunday family special. Large pizza, bucket of wings, four garlic rolls (which by the way are delicious and so addictive) and a two liter of soda for $36. Tell me a deal like that for this quality of food anywhere else! The owners are ALWAYS there which shows a true testament to their dedication to quality control and making sure their customers get the best possible service. Truly authentic, amazing food."}
{"text":"By far the worst pizza in vegas don't waste your time and money. frozen pizza has more flavor, waited 30 extra min for my order while the staff was yelling and arguing with each other by the time I finally got my order it was cold and soggy"}
{"text":"S'alright.

Pretty much it.  I mean, this place isn't bad, but it boils down to what kinda pizza YOU like.  My wife liked this place a lot more than I did.  I guess this is more of a NY style pizza.

We tried a cheese pizza that they had on special.  It was pretty large, at least 16\" across.  To be honest though, it reminded me of pizza we had gotten served in school.  I mean, it was done right: cooked through and through, perfect amount of cheese and sauce across it, and the crust was pretty good.  But... well, I grew up in Chicago, so again, I guess it boils down to the style of pizzas you like.

We had some mozzarella sticks, and those were actually pretty effing awesome.  My wife loved the ranch, I thought it was runny.  She thought the marinara was pretty good, I thought it was kinda bland.  Course, my wife is the gourmand of the relationship, so she might be right (however I think her palate is off keel, but I'll never tell her that... to her face... or in vicinity or same nation as her).

Honestly though, it was good enough that I'd give it another try.  My wife definitely so, but... well... this isn't her review."}
{"text":"LOVE IT.. LOVED IT.. 
Second time here, good food for a reasonable price. Friendly staff, family orientated.
I would recommend this place to everyone. I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"My MIL and I dropped in for lunch. 

She got the 2 pizza slice special with a soda. She said it was OK, but she decided to take it home and reheat it and it tasted better the next day with the sauce sopped up into the crust. Otherwise the crust was a bit generic.

I got a stromboli with meatball. Nice sized portion and the meatballs were decent, but the crust on the bottom was a little doughy so I ate mostly what was on top. Their marinara for it was decent - not too sweet or tangy. 

Decent enough spot it seems for pizza type goods, but it fell about middle of the road for me. I still havent found my near the house pizza spot just yet. Check out the board or counter for some papers with lunch specials and daily family style specials as those seem to make for a good deal."}
{"text":"Food was good and the staff were courteous and to all the other customers. I'll be eating here more often."}
{"text":"This place became one of my new go-to local pizza shops after another one I frequented nearby changed ownership and went to crap. I'm glad I made the switch, cause this place rocks.
It pretty much covers everything on a checklist you would have for a pizzeria (if you had one). Giant pizza slices? Check. Large food portions? Check. Decent enough pricing where you're in awe with the amount of food you get, but not low enough to worry about the sanitation rating of the place? Check. Friendly staff? Check. Yes, you get the picture. 
Most of the pizzas are premade, so if you don't want nothing fancy you can pick a slice and they warm it up and serve it to you. If you want a whole pizza to go, they are fairly quick with making it, though it's best to order a head of time. 
I think my only grump about this place is the garlic rolls. They're good, but they always make me sick. I still eat them anyway cause I'm a dumbass."}
{"text":"#1 Food - FANTASTIC. addicting flavors, taste
#2 Service - Absolutely PERFECT - delivery also perfect!
#3 Staff - WONDERFUL - Friendly, happy and a joy to meet

All in all, simply the best pizza and things in Centennial Hills!

This was the Founder/Original Owner - Has since been sold and regretfully, not of the same friendliness or quality of food!"}
{"text":"I worked there for a month. Was in the pizza biz from 16yrs old to 38. Retired at 56 in transportation. Bored, made a pizza for them and got a job. 15- 20 hours a week. 
  The whole crew \"cares\" about product, service and cleanlinest. 
I suggest 2 for 1 pizzas on Tuesday. Also take home some garlic rolls. .99 cents with side of marinara. 
If you stop in, get ready for \"welcome\" from the crew. 
One more thing, Anthony and Kassady just graduated from high school, tell them congratulations."}
{"text":"So I was told this place has been under new owners for awhile. And I finally ordered from them to check it out. 

Excellent. From the phone service to how long it took to get to our house and the taste of our food. 

The pizza was good. Good portions of toppings and sauce. 
We had their white pizza - as always, beware of the garlic. I love garlic. 
Pepperoni half/Sausage and black olives half - yummy. The pepperoni was slightly better. 
Wings (hot) - super yummy. They weren't over cooked, over sauced and the buffalo sauce had an excellent flavor. 

Overall, we paid maybe $41 for a large pizza, small pizza and 10 wings. Not too shabby at all! Perfect for the nights you have guests and don't want to cook for UFC. 

I'm super happy with the change and I hope they continue to do well!"}
{"text":"It was an employee that told me dough was pre made. I know what grande cheese melts like and it wasn't that so unless you have a blend not sure what is going on.We live less than 5 minutes from the place so please don't try to blame anything regarding quality of ingredients on our drive home that is just rude."}
{"text":"Upon moving to Providence, we hadn't found a good pizza place that delivers to the house. I was about to give up and then I called this place. There pizza is very good! It's one of the better places up in this area. Wasn't a big fan of there garlic knots which is a shame, but the pizza was super yummy and our guests thought so too."}
{"text":"Pizza time!

Order a Sausage / Pepperoni Pizza. Very greasy and cheesy...just how I like em! 

The crust REALLY reminded me of take n bake pizza LOL. Tasted different than any other NY style pizza I've had before...does authentic crust = cheaper ingredients = take n bake flavor?  Overall, it was good...just not my style of dough I guess.

Also ordered Garlic Rolls! Good amount of garlic flavor with a sweet marinara. I enjoyed the crispy outsides, but the insides were a little bit more \"doughy\" than I would have preferred.  Perhaps it's just the dough they use here?

I'd recommend giving it a shot if you are in the area, but it didn't really impress me personally."}
{"text":"WAs next door getting my car checked out, and had time for a slice or two  of pizza.
It was really good... Nice crust. Sauce was good. and the cheese was perfect..  What more can one ask for."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here twice now. Pizza is excellent and perhaps the best I've had in Vegas. Delivery was below thirty minutes both times and the same delivery driver was very friendly and appreciative of the business. 

The second time was a Saturday, so I ordered the stromboli special. I ordered the meatball stromboli and it was amazing. It's huge and rather filling -- I had to save the pizza for later."}
{"text":"Do not order off the yelp or Eat24 app. The restaurant does not get the info, go to their website directly. The place was packed.. but they had great customer service and were able to help me get my order. Haven't eaten the food yet, but judging by the crowd here I'm assuming it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Get a regular pie well done, as close to NYC style as you can get. They have great daily specials as well."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. They have authentic NY style pizza. It's amazing! Not to mention they have really great deals. Tuesday's special is buy one get one. It doesn't get better. I highly recommend all pizza lovers to try it."}
{"text":"Pretty much all the good reviews on here did it justice.  I was pleasantly satisfied with everything I got w/ the fam!  Italian Sausage Pizza, Mild and Cajun Wings, Garlic Rolls, the Original Stromboli, and a Cannoli. 
Solid pizza joint :D"}
{"text":"We absolutely love the food from here! The only thing better than the food is the customer service!  The delivery drivers actually make conversation with you when they get to your door! We ordered the cannoli's and they did not disappoint!  So nice to have good pizza around and if you order the specials, it makes it more affordable!"}
{"text":"We went here today since it was national pepperoni pizza day and the food was.. meh.

Was it gross? No way.  The crust was crispy and had a good texture. But the sauce and toppings were average. 

Also ordered buffalo wings that were very dry. I like my wings dripping in hot tangy sauce that requires multiple napkins.  These wings required none. 

Maybe I'm hard to please because I'm originally from New York.  But I've had better pizza here in Vegas.

Will we eat here again? Perhaps.  But our quest for great pizza in Vegas continues."}
{"text":"We were hungry but wanted to stay close to home so we ended up at Above the Crust. I've had their pizza and chicken wings at Johnny Fontane's before and thought they were both good.

The first thing that caught my attention as I was walking up to the counter to place our order were the garlic rolls. They looked so good. We got a large half sausage and half pepperoni pizza and some garlic rolls. 

Pizza:
Great thin crispy crust, tomato sauce didn't taste like cheap goo, the sausage and pepperoni made the pizza a bit greasy, and the cheese stayed ooey gooey. 4/5

Garlic Rolls:
Comes with marinara. Warm rolls that are garlicky and tasty. A bit crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. 4.5/5

The girls that work here are really friendly, attentive and were making sure the place was clean. They deliver and they have BOGO cheese pizza on Tuesdays. The owner is from New York...mmmmm...pizza!"}
{"text":"We got a coupon in the mail for a buy one get one large cheese pizza for this new pizza place that had just opened. I looked on yelp and it looks like it relocated from another location and the previous reviews all sounded good and this place was worth trying.
Well that was not the case. The place itself is decorated very nicely and the staff is nice. That's where the experience took a turn.
The pizzas looked great, smelled great but right when you pick a piece up you realize that something is not right. The crust has got to be one of the worst crusts my family has ever had. We basically ate the pizza because we paid for it...btw a large cheese pizza was like $16 and we had to pay an extra $2 to add pepperoni to the second pizza.
I have included pics but don't be fooled by how yummy they look...you can't get past that crust!!!
We will not be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very good Philly Steak Stromboli. Been looking for a great pizza shop with a good family vibe and I found one without having to drive far. I would recommend this place to everyone. Outstanding customer service and food."}
{"text":"Love their calzones, wings, & garlic knots. Good service and very clean. They do not skimp on filling their calzones & we seriously love that!  I can't wait for cheat days to eat here! ;)"}
{"text":"Tried it out for the first time the other day. The price was about $20 for a large pepperoni pizza which was about the same as metro pizza. It was really good, so for now I'll share my pizza dollars between the best 2 pizza places in the northwest valley. If they had better prices I'd go only to them only. I went back for another visit and did it on Tuesday and got the buy one cheese get one free. It was excellent. I wish the special was on all pizzas and even other days of the week or an early lunch special of the pizza deal. Thank you, and see you again."}
{"text":"I've heard people talking about this pizza joint and how good it is so me and mi amigos decided to stop in this afternoon. Had a slice of pepperoni. Very good indeed. Not greasy, not soggy. Toppings fresh. Cheese very good too. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I can't say that I've tried the pizza yet but the homemade potato chips are life altering! One of the Moms at the dance studio close-by highly recommended them so I just had to see for myself. They are well seasoned, crispy and hearty! They also come with a tasty ranch dressing that has a nice garlic punch. My two daughters consumed most of the generous portion of chips and have begged to get more every time I've taken them to dance (3 times a week). I'll try the pizza some day...if I can ever resist the chips!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Just terrible pizza. I am a bit of a pizza snob and I always order cheese pizza the first time I try a new shop.  My theory is that it is easy to hide terrible pizza in toppings.  I was genuinely sad to taste this pizza. How does a place get 4.5 stars on yelp. Flavorless crust, bottom basement sauce. In one word \"disappointing \"."}
{"text":"Very poor service and quality at the Simmons location!I had the Saturday special.large pizza and stromboli delivered and the pizza was stale,The stromboli was watery ,I also ordered the chicken fingers and they arrived an hour or so later with wings! So I called and they sent my fingers another 35 minutes later with no ranch and they were soggy with hard chunks of cartilage...no accommodations for messing up ,just an apology which I would have understood, everyone makes mistakes but the quality of food just wasnt good..I'm very disappointed and will likely not be going back here.If you want quality try sabitinos on Cheyenne and buffalo ,They are the real deal and you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We ordered some delivery tonight. We got the Italian nachos, which were tasty but nothing to write home about. Maybe if we had gotten them there and it had them delivered they'd be better. We also got a garden salad with the Italian dressing. It was really good. The dressing was a very robust delicious Italian. The spinach calzone was delicious. Cooked perfectly. The marinara sauce that went with it though was watery and rather bland. The AC special pizza was good. The dough is great and key for a good pizza in my book.
We might order again but it won't be at the top of our list of pizza places to order from."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! Garlic rolls melt in your mouth. Everything we have eaten here has been great. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Pizza was really greasy and the garlic knot was raw in the middle. The driver got lost and tried to blame it on me. I pretty sure know my building number, man! He also said he didn't carry change! Based off another review, I now think this is a hustle they are trying to run.  Wtf?!"}
{"text":"I think this is the 4th place at this spot I'm the last 10 years or so, and my first time here was a mixed bag.  First, the staff is very friendly, and the service was fine.

We ordered the garlic rolls for the appetizer, and it was just okay for me.  I personally prefer a little more garlic.  I wasn't impressed with the veggie pizza at all.  I prefer my veggies cooked into the pizza instead of piled on.  For one, the seem to cook better and soften up.  Second, they stay on the pizza instead of falling off, especially if they're loaded in--which in this case--they were. 

However, I really enjoyed the pepperoni pizza.  Not sure why the difference, but it really was night & day for me.

If I make my way back, I may just stick to the pizza basics."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and will definitely be back.  The staff is friendly and courteous.  The restaurant is clean and the prices are reasonable.  I love that their large pizza is actually large!  I will say that if you like your hot wings wet, you have to ask for extra sauce.  Overall great meal."}
{"text":"Above the Crust is a great neighborhood Pizza Place! Staff is very friendly and the place is spotless. The parking...who cares!! Its a quiet older strip mall..who cares!!
Its about the Pizza...and well the pizza is darn good! We enjoy the calzone and stromboli as well. They are huge and sooo cheesy. The garlic knots are fantastic, tons of flavor...perfect with the garlic ranch. Tonight we enjoyed the chicken cordon bleu pizza...outstanding! The two slice special with a drink is a great deal at 5 bucks. 
Oh and Fried cheesecake....seriously!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. After the first time, I didn't expect to go back because it was less than stellar, but friends wanted to go and I'm glad we joined them. The second time we ordered different things and were really pleased!

The boyfriend is a pickier eater, preferring plain (boring) cheese pizza. Luckily, the staff had no problems letting us ordering half of one type of pie, and half of another. The first time we got a half veggie, and while the veggies and crust were slightly undercooked for my liking, it was adequate. The second time we got a half Greek with red sauce, and it was delicious (they didn't skimp on the spinach and everything was piping hot).

The garlic knots are delicious. They taste a lot like Villa Pizza's, which is actually a compliment because those food court rolls are my comfort food. I swear, I could survive off those alone!

Disclaimer: you can not leave without getting the fried cheesecake. Covered in cinnamon and sugar and fried to perfection, it's a real treat.

The portions are ginormous! A simple side salad was overflowing with fresh greens. A side of fries filled a full-sized plate. Two people could feast for less than $20.

I love that they're flexible and down to earth. They let us move tables around for a large group and were accommodating with tweaking orders.

Down to earth set up, affordable prices, and a polite and quirky staff make this place great. I'm giving it a 3 for now, because my first trip was less than memorable, but we'll definitely be back to see if they continue to be as great as they were the second time around."}
{"text":"I recently went to pick up a pizza and meatball stromboli on the Saturday night special.  Wow...what a lot of good food at a great price!  The inside is very clean and the decor is very inviting.  The staff was very friendly when I went in to pick up my order.  I will definitely be back to try some more items!!!"}
{"text":"Good wings,  great pizza. We got the Philly cheese steak pizza and it was really good. Will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Have ordered from here many times! Always good food. LOVE their Stromboli. Pizza is always yummy. Staff is always happy to help. Just disappointed that they don't deliver to my address any longer. :-( They used to! Dang! Totally bummed! Would still be ordering if I could! Haha!"}
{"text":"We ordered their pizza, wings and fingers for a small party. The quality was good and they delivered in half the time. We are excited to find a tasty pizza place close to home. We are definitely fans of Above the Crust."}
{"text":"This place has the bestttt pizza on the Northwest! Maybe even in all of Vegas. My nail salon is next door so I always make sure to pop in for a fresh slice of pizza on my trips up there. On top of the amazing food, the service is incredible!"}
{"text":"This is a great family pizzeria. The wife and I love bringing the kids here or even ordering a pie to go. 
Their white pie is simply amazing with lots of flavor and just the right amount of garlic. The crust has just the right amount of crunch but still soft in the center. 
Forget chain pizza places like Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns or Little Cesar's 
Needless to say that this is now our go to pizzeria as a family. 

Oh and be sure to try their fresh house made potato chips!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza like the big slices you get in NY and their calzones are huge, stuffed with cream cheese and mozzarella!"}
{"text":"Good for real! Italian nachos were on point and delishhh. The pizza was decent aswell. Dont forget to get the garlic knot thingys those are very gewd also. Will be comming back to geg fatter."}
{"text":"We love this joint!  Staff is always friendly and helpful and the food is great!  Love that they started delivery service.  Yesterday we ordered a pizza and wings .  They brought the wrong pizza which I didn't realize until a while after the driver left .  I wasn't going to even call about it but when my husband got home he called .   They came right back with the correct pizza.  Didn't ask for the wrong one back AND refunded me for the pizza!   The refund blew me away!  I would
Not have expected that at all!   That is a class act of customer service!   Thank you!"}
{"text":"Horrible consistency after 3 pies one bad at the grand opening  , one ok and one horrible days later and I always order extra cheese and two of the three had hardly any cheese ? To be fair the pizza  is 10 times better at the Ann and 95 location as the employee says its probably not the same type of oven at Simmons but that still doesnt explain no cheese on extra cheese ? , who knows but Im done playing Russian roulette with this location moments from my house  .
Consistency is the key and this location has none in my opinion ."}
{"text":"This place is fire  Nice crispy pizza they know what they're doing iatabove the crust"}
{"text":"Had a great cheese slice today! Left wanting another but knew my diet wouldn't approve. They have nice display case of their pizzas, garlic rolls and pepperoni rolls. Nice variety of menu items. Calzones, Strombolian, speciality pizzas, wings, etc! Open daily!"}
{"text":"Excellent salad and wings tonight. Ordered using their site instead of Yelp and got a discount (which I turned into a tip). These guys are close, but I'd drive a long way for such good food and good service!  Try them out, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their pizza is so good and perfectly flavored and their pasta is amazing."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I had their Italian sandwich and it was the best I've ever had! The meat was great, but the centerpiece was the Italian dressing. I know it sounds silly, but it was the best dressing and truly made the sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great food, great people.   We have been going here for years.   It has changed ownership a couple years ago and thought it would not be as good.   Thankfully they kept much of the same great food but added their own unique touch to the menu.   The portions are generous, everything is fresh and it is reasonably priced.   My favorite thing here is the chicken fingers and a straight forward pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places.  The crust is homemade, lots of good toppings but my favorite is the wings and fingers.  We like the Asian Zest but Spicy BBQ is also a favorite.  Everything is made fresh and the owner is beyond great.  A great neighborhood stop for dinner or lunch"}
{"text":"Great service. Had a family run business feel to it. Everyone was welcoming and friendly and seemed to actually like being at work 
Pizza was good. Although my pineapple half of the pizza was incorrectly made as a pepperoni, the overall pizza was still good. Wasn't a fan of the wings although hubs said they were cooked well. Next time we want pizza I can definitely get hubs to agree to skip the almost weekly Pizza Hut order and return, checking the order before leaving!"}
