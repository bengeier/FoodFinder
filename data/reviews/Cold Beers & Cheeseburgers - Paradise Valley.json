{"text":"Perfect ending after a round of golf. Burgers are big & lots of toppings to choose from. Great selection of beers as we caught up on the latest sports on the screens around the room."}
{"text":"This location is my favorite so far. I live the Juicy Lucy and the Jucy Lucifer, and the protein style is really great!"}
{"text":"Well this new business replaced Tilted Kilt in this location. You would think they would be better than Kilt since Kilt in this location was awful. Sorry some things are the same. Slow service. Took forever to get the bartender back down to the end of the bar where we were sitting. Food was missing items ordered which means the kitchen is not in sync. On a positive note the onion dip was the bomb and the pretzel was great. Beer was cold and a nice variety. Let's hope they correct the things that were wrong if not they will go the way of the Kilt."}
{"text":"Horrible. I know it's fathers day and they are giving away free meals to dad's, but horrible.  I can't tell you if the food was good. It never came.  After 2 drinks and waiting over an hour for a salad,  onion rings and kid's meals,  we left.  It was lunchtime,  and we could see the food piled up in the back,  no runners.  In fact,  I watched an order go to our table (nope) another (nope) and finally make its way to a table. Management needs to get their act together and get food out.  Drinks weren't even that great to make us want to stay. Horrible father's day choice."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday. The inside was really busy so we got seated in the patio area. We were the only customers out there for a while. Long enough to be forgotten about. We ended up going back to the host to ask for someone to come out. Our waitress came and was very apologetic, she came back with water for the table and stated that she spoke with the manager and will be offering a discount for the wait. That right there, impressed me. I appreciated that she was empathetic enough to want to be able to compensate a negative experience to turn it into something good.   We order and time goes by with other customers now seated around us in the patio. Some of those parties were actually getting their foods already before us. The waitress again was apologetic and before wrapping up our meal she said the bill was on the house. Again, that shows me character. Any restaurant could've simply not given a discount, compensate an appetizer or offer a free dessert. But they wiped the bill clean since they knew that, essentially, we had a negative experience. Because of this, we'd definitely go back. In an industry you're in, if the service is bad you'd be hesitant to even give it a second thought."}
{"text":"Pretty standard burger, service is inconsistent, i do like the makeover to the place, it was very dark and closed off when it was the tilted kilt."}
{"text":"UPDATE:  we came back tonight because I've been thinking about that Mac and cheese since last time.  I wish we hadn't.  This is no exaggeration, we've been there for two hours.  Two hours.  Checked in at 6:20pm on my Facebook, and I'm just driving away now.  What I will say is that the Mac and cheese was stellar...but holy moly the service!  It wasn't just us, everyone w our waitress was complaining, she would disappear for very long periods of time (think 10-15 minutes at least).  We had a burger, the Mac and cheese, and wings and we were there for TWO HOURS!!  At one point, we asked the server who was waiting the table next to us, as she had turned two tables in the time we were there, to check on our food.  We had received our wings and it was 30 minutes before we got our food!  She checked w the kitchen and confirmed it was taking a bit too long...we would have asked our server but she was truly nowhere to be found.  She was very sweet, but just not efficient.  The tall male manager was visiting many tables and because we were close to the kitchen, we could hear him telling her guests were looking for her, but he never apologized, never came by, and in fact-was at the hostess stand when we were leaving and didn't even say bye!  The waitress took my debit card that was lying on the table and put it in her back pocket; she ran my card before I even GOT the check...she was carrying my card around on her for a solid 20 minutes before she came back w the receipt for me to sign.  It was just really bad service.  Sadly, I am updating my rating to 3 stars from 4...the food is great but the service is just really bad!!    To start off, I think they've done a great job renovating the building.  I was worried whether or not it could shake the kilt vibe...but it has!  Menu is good; I got the PB&J burger, cooked w some pink.  It was delicious; the spicy sauce that comes w is great!!  Fries are also good...three other burgers were had w my group and all seemed great.  The guys next to me ordered the Mac and cheese and I regretted not ordering for the rest of the day!!! It looked great.  Totally would have given this a 5 star rate but I thought the service was a little lacking.  We weren't greeted right away; sort of expected to get prompter service by going at an off time (Thursday evening).  It was a decent crowd but not so busy that I think the service should have been as slow or flat as it was.  Our waitress wasn't rude; she just wasn't polite.  She gave no effort, didn't even thank us when we had a more than $200 bill.  We had to go to the bar once to request refills on beers because she had been gone for like 10-15 minutes.  I'm sure it was an off night because I've always had great service at the other locations; give her the benefit of the doubt and will most definitely return!!  Love having a great burger and beer spot so close to the house!"}
{"text":"After posting my review Carly reached out to me via email and apologized for our service the last time we went there and sent us a gift card to use to try the restaurant again. That was very nice. We went back This past Friday evening and the place was bumping. We had to wait about 10 or so minutes to be seated which wasn't bad at all. This time we were out on the patio overlooking cactus road. Our server was very nice and made a point to stop by our table and refill our waters a few times which shows me she was very on top of her tables. I ordered the blue cheese burger and my wife ordered the Monterey chicken sandwich. Just like the last time it did take a little over a half an hour to get our food after we ordered, but different this time was a manager coming over and apologizing for the delay and asked us if we would like anything while we waited. We just asked if they could bring out some chips for us to snack on to tide us over. The food came out and once again the food is amazing! I am happy that the managers are on top of the issues with the time it takes for orders to come out and offering us some complimentary drinks or appetizers was nice as well. We really do love the restaurant, we just hope they can work out these kinks soon."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre.  Nobody in my party was impressed. There are too many better options around to eat here."}
{"text":"Can't tell you how much I enjoy this place. Cheeseburgers are stellar, in fact everything on the menu rocks! And beer! Cold, plentiful and phenomenal selection."}
{"text":"Pros: Best veggie burger I've ever had. Great onion rings, good selection on the menu of food and beer. Friendly waitress. Great patio atmosphere.   Cons:  Super busy, hostesses didn't even acknowledge us for a few minutes. When I told one that we put our name in through yelp, she said okay... then 5 minutes later another hostess asked who we were and said we weren't on the list. I told her we added our name through yelp and she said \"oh we don't use that yet it's super frustrating.\" Hmmmmm... ok. Maybe don't reserve through yelp.  Long wait for food, but the waitress was awesome and did apologize.   Overall, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, service was very quick and accurate.  Bartender Courtney was more than helpful with her suggestions for a build your own burger.  Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"We experienced some of the worst service ever at a restaurant. Half of our order was not placed and the manager truly failed to address the issue. Very disappointed.  This restaurant just lost our business."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times. Usually the staff is prompt with service and very friendly. I took my mother there yesterday afternoon at 2 (Saturday). No kidding, we sat there 20 minutes without any acknowledgement whatsoever. The waitress knew we were there and refused to give us eye contact. So after 25 minutes we left. BIG error on her part. We go out to eat a lot. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We have been waiting for this location to open for a while now. We stopped by for a late lunch over the weekend hoping there wouldn't be a long wait since the lunch rush was over. It only took a few minutes to be seated and everyone at the hostess desk was friendly while we waited.  The beer selection is large and there are tvs everywhere so I can see how this would be a great place to sit and watch a game while having a drink. They also have a pool table of you feel like a game. I ordered the Huli Huli chicken sandwich and my husband had the hangover burger. They come with chips and for $2 more you can swap out the side and get fries or tots instead. Honestly... a burger should come with fries not chips so I wasn't thrilled with the upcharge. The fries ended up having way too much salt and pepper on them and we didn't end up waiting them so it was a major let down. The sandwiches were good though.  Our server was super friendly and did a great job. Lunch for two was about $35.00 before the tip."}
{"text":"New to the area and it's great to find my new favorite burger place right away! Cheeseburgers are one of my favorite foods- so it's nice to have a reasonably priced date-night burger place to go with my husband. Our server was Krystal- she was so helpful and patient as we got familiar with the menu. I got the BYOB (build your own burger, extra pickles!)- just classic to see what they do well. They have gourmet and specialty burgers as well, but I'm a purist I guess. We got the table side s'mores which was a lot of fun- but I like to get a dessert I can't make at home. I'm trying the shake next time."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I typically like this restaurant but this location was awful.  We arrived around 3 on Saturday. Most of the staff was unpleasant. Our order arrived incorrectly.  We had to grab 3 different ketchup bottles from 3 different table because they were all empty.  Server forgot my refill soda.  Overall, a hot mess at this location!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out the new CB&CB on a Saturday night which was probably not the best idea.  We arrived and were told that they weren't seating any new tables because their kitchen was so backed up which is never a good sign but I appreciated their honesty.  We put our name in and found a place to squeeze in at the bar for a drink while waiting.   The bartenders were all extremely friendly and helpful and made sure to tell us the kitchen was backed up.  Ordered a couple of drinks and waiting for our table.   Once seated we were greeted promptly by our server and we both placed our orders.  The food came out pretty quickly actually but both of plates were missing items.  I had ordered the PB&J and Bacon burger (don't knock it until you try it) and it came out with no bacon.  I mean come on people it's in the name of the burger and you forget it?  The food runner brought me a small plate with two cold bacon strips after I told him it was missing.  This somehow left it to be desired.  The bottom of my pretzel bun was so hard and dried out I could barely cut through it with my steak knife. No joke I had to saw through it.  The cook on the burger was perfect though and the flavors were great.  My wife did a build your own burger and they left off two of the toppings she selected but we were both so hungry we didn't dare send it back to the kitchen.    The place itself was very nice.  Great patio with tv's everywhere and a great beer selection.  I will have to go back and give them a try once they have worked out their kinks in the kitchen since it's only been open for a month or so.  Hoping it's not the norm for this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming in and I loved it. The beer special was awesome, summer shady, I suggest trying it. I ordered the totachos and it was amazing. I sat at the bar and courtney and morgan were a power team together. They made sure our experience was awesome. Will be back"}
{"text":"Bar staff needs serious training.... ugh.  I have been to other sites for Cburgers and Beer and all were good...food is great and good atmosphere... but bartender tonight was just not with it at all.  Didnt come back for 20 m after dropping off menu... then I had to flag someone to get her to come take food order... couple next to me had same issue.  She is just a cute girl that doesn't get it..... at ALL.  Check said Lindsay but that may have been the bartender who took over... not sure... I came in at 6 and seemed to only be one bartender and then another took over... who was wonderful.  Anyway... hope they get it together... this area needs a good sports themed bar with good food !!!!! Local guy...."}
{"text":"The beer is always cold and the food is Great. After a long day of golf this is the place to go. Management is friendly and so is the staff. Courtney was the bartender and always go above and beyond. Will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent food, cold beers and great service! Happy to have a location in the area.   Our group got a mix of burgers and Mac and there wasn't a complaint. Great patio if the weather is nice enough too!"}
{"text":"I normally love Cold Beer and Cheeseburger but this time not so much. The food was amazing like normal. The thing that annoyed me was that the bartender with the arm tattoo on her right took a picture of me. She tried to play it off. Next time be more subtle and don't take pictures of your customers. I wish I could give them no stars."}
{"text":"For quite a while I have heard of Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers but never actually gone to one.  I had only heard good things about my friends' visits.  Little did I know that one location would open up in an area I visit regularly.  This past week, I stopped by for my first time.  I first came across some fun themed decorations outside the building including a special beer-themed fountain.  Then, I walked inside and was immediately greeted and given a table.    Little did I know that it was just the start of National Burger Month!  While I was considering Mac and Cheese originally, this was the kicker for me to instead get a burger.  The next question was which burger to get.  The All-American Burgers are apparently delicious but with so many specialty burgers, why stop there?  From stuffed patties (Jucy Lucy Burger), the Bacon PB&J Burger, and even the Mmmac & Cheese Burger, each half pound burger is memorable unto itself!  I added a side salad (Caesar) which was delicious and a filling addition to the burger.    There are also promotions, specials, a VIP club that anyone can sign up for, and happy hour deals.  Every Monday, for instance, is Mmmac Daddy Monday, and there are even burger challenges and more on their website.  Definitely worth a visit!  And if you didn't know, Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers is part of Square One Concepts, one of eight restaurant concepts (five in the Phoenix area).    I had a great time though I look forward to trying other dishes in the future!  Also, if there's a wait, use the No Wait app to see if there's a line or to put your name down as you head over."}
{"text":"First visit here.  Restaurant was very accommodating to our large group, and the service we great!   Appreciated that they had various healthy choice options, other than cheeseburgers.  I chose a veggie burger with grilled asparagus on the side, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar vibe. Reminds me of a Buffalo Wild Wings with burgers. I had the 1000 Island burger. The flavor was good, but the burger meat was too big to handle without cutting it in half. My husband had the Juicy Lucy. He said the cheese wasn't infused in the burger like they described. Overall, nice family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this Place lots of TV's for all sports, Great food! And the Service is the best part of all of it! Erika is my Favorite Server shes always on top of everything always has a smile and makes the experience a blast! Everyone should come here!"}
{"text":"This would be my last lunch outing close to my workplace, since the offices are moving. I had to go out on a good note so this week awaited visit was a must! What was formerly known as Tilted Kilt is now   Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers! One other time I visited the location on old town, so I was familiar with the cuisine. Today I kept it simple and did not have a cheeseburger. Instead I went with the tater tot appetizer meal that the bartender recommended. I was impressed how quickly my meal came out. How I can describe this dish is a loaded tater tot dish mixed with chili meat, guacamole, sour cream and some nacho cheese mix. Very very tasty and unique and the service by the bartender Courtney was appreciated. Overall all of the bartenders behind the bar asked on several occasions how my dish was and if I needed anything else. This is a plus and impressed with my experience!"}
{"text":"Good choice of beer, which is great. But chicken wings suck. Food is simply mediocre."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time , I ordered a veggie Burger and it was all over the place, my tots were cold. The manger came to the table to remake it and they remade it wrong and the tots had way to much seasoning. Two other customers were speaking to the manager about the service and quality. I'm glad we weren't the only ones who thought this place wasn't the best. Sad how the manager was no help and the server was bitchy about the whole situation. Most importantly to me was the quality it was trash I was better off going to In-n-out and getting a grilled cheese. I can't believe I wasted my money."}
{"text":"Aw, the Steak Burger I had here was extremely disappointing. It was dry and flavorless. The fries weren't any better and the price was ridiculously high. $15.50 plus an extra $2.00 for the fries. For a $15 burger, the fries should be included. Anyway, service was ordinary. I got to the table late while my party was already there and the server didn't even acknowledge me once - the whole time I was there.   I don't think we will be back. The s'mores dessert wasn't great either. For a burger, fries, s'mores and a kids Mac and cheese, we spent close to $50. Not worth it."}
{"text":"This place has the right formula...great food, great music, great staff, and oh...did I mention great food?  The TVs that surround you are great too. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"I was thinking of giving this place five stars, but I am kind of teetering on five stars or one star. I mean I can probably be persuaded with free desserts."}
{"text":"Haven't been seated yet, so full experience is yet to be had However, judging by the hostess, I sure hope it's not indicative of the wait staff.  Dear hostess, I hate to bother you but we would like a table of 4 and to give this restaurant money..sorry to bother you. Try smiling..you are in the service industry"}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere. They have an awesome patio with misters that really work! I tried the Rocky Point burger and my husband tried the Arizona burger. We were 100% satisfied throughout our whole experience. Our server was very busy but great at the same time. The hostess always have a smile on their faces and are so friendly as well as the bartenders. Can't wait to go back and try more of their awesome food!"}
{"text":"I'm glad to say that this location has moved up to a 4 star now that they've worked out there opening 'kinks.'   We love the Build Your Own Wednesday night special.  The burgers are juicy and the choice of toppings is first rate.    If I could make one suggestion is that it's disappointing families can't enjoy the outdoor bar area.  If this were a true bar Id understand it but it's really a more laid back environment.  The open, airy environment is for 21 and older and the empty seats reflect it."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places for Burgers and wings.  This is a newer location.  Wait wasn't bad for a Friday night but drinks, apps and dinner took way too long.  Server was not attentive to this until the end.  I sure wish manager would have checked and asked and offered to check on our food as server was not.  I hope they work out some bugs!"}
{"text":"I really like the energy and openness of the bar area. The food is good but I the Mac n cheese isn't that great. The staff is good and it's really close to my house and easy to access."}
{"text":"Loved it! Tatianna was amazing and very attentive! The food was great and the atmosphere was very chill and relaxed. The music was also on point! I will defiantly be returning here! Thanks Tati!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves CBCB and we frequent these places a lot. We were excited when this location opened as it is probably the closest to where we live. The 7th St. location is the next closest and we had issues there when it first opened too. Not sure how long this new location has been open so maybe this is just \"growing pains\". We sat at the bar like we usually do, service was a bit slow and the bartender seemed irritated when we were ready to place our food order at the time she delivered our drinks. We both got the Happy Hour cheeseburger - I asked for no lettuce with extra pickles and cooked medium, my boyfriend asked for no lettuce also cooked medium. Both burgers were well done and my boyfriends burger was literally 1/2 the size of mine. He had no pickles on his which was not requested. They don't write the order down and they rarely seem to get it correct. The overcooked burger is a problem we have experienced at other locations too.   We won't be back to that location for a while. The best luck we have had is in Scottsdale on Scottsdale Road and Mayo and the downtown Scottsdale location neither of which is that convenient for us.  I hope things get better!"}
{"text":"Went there for my wife's birthday as it is near my home and noticed it was always full. It is full for a good reason. : great food, atmosphere and excellent service with all staff. A special shout out to our server, Crystal who was very genuine, nice and knowledgeable. When I forgot my phone she chased us out to the parking lot yelling my wife's name. A big thank you for that Crystal and for going above and beyond!"}
{"text":"I realize this is a new location, and I sincerely hope they take the yelp feedback and use it to improve. A few things: I ordered my burger medium well and it was suuuper raw; my friend's sliders were swimming in grilled onions, to the point were it became a huge, soggy mess; and the blt was disappointing with soggy lettuce. The fries, tots and sodas were great. Also, the back of my chair was inches from falling off the fairly steep edge of the patio...it could cause serious injury if someone isn't careful. Also, a child or dog could easily walk right out into the busy road. I brought this to the manager's attention (I guess I'm that person now), and he said he was aware and that the contractors will be fixing it but that they \"didn't work on the weekends\". Ayayay. I hope you guys get better."}
{"text":"First time at this chain. Good burgers. But they were overdone, so we waited a very long time to get them redone.   At $13.50 per burger, I would have expected them to take a little something off the bill after waiting near an hour to eat, but they didn't.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Beers and burgers! The name says it all and doesn't disappoint. I have been here three times and will definitely be back for more. All of the burgers I have had are great (except the PB and J one, don't get it. It is the worst burger I have ever had!) They have a wide selection of beers with something for everyone (unless they haven't updated their menu... which is always super annoying). The staff is on par with most other establishments but the service is nothing to rave about. I recommend and will return."}
{"text":"We love Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers! Sooo happy it opened in our neighborhood!!!! Lindsey ALWAYS takes the best care of us... always welcoming with a smile! Their burgers ROCK!!!!!!!!! The beer rocks too!"}
{"text":"OMG!  Just opened and took family there and could not believe how bad the service was and how overpriced the food was.  $16 burgers?  Got billed twice for my burger and overcharged for happy hour specials.  Terrible....just Terrible.  Food quality is average at best.  Also, there is an $2.00 upcharge for fries/onion rings with the already overpriced burgers that just come with chips.  This is a big no-no in the restaurant biz and will probably be axed soon - hopefully.  What really upset me about this visit is that the manager had numerous opportunities to do something extra for us (I.e. my first burger was late to the table because it fell on the ground!).  He never offered anything and even tried to get me to pay full price for two happy hour wines.  Unfortunately, unless things change quickly here, this place will follow in the footsteps of the Tilted Kilt that went our of business.  The menu prices are simply to expensive for the location and food quality."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with a cold beer and a cheeseburger? I have been here twice, the first time I ordered the chicken tenders, and the second time I had the All American burger. Here's what I love: they are a great family restaurant. The picnic tables are great for big parties and when my son spilled his chocolate milk, they were so patient, cleaned it up for us, and got us new chocolate milk. Here's what I didn't love: the burgers are not cooked according to what one requests. I requested my burger cooked medium, and it was well done. No pink whatsoever. Our server was a bit scatterbrained, so it wasn't even worth it to let her know so they could make me a new one. She forgot to bring us ketchup for 15 minutes, so I just ate my burger as cooked. I will try again since I love burgers so much, but unfortunately the cook wasn't \"on\" that night."}
{"text":"In addition to its namesake (cold beers and cheeseburgers), this neighborhood restaurant serves up tater tots, hummus, grilled cheese, and milkshakes. The food is great!  But, the friendly service is the best part.  You will get a server like Tautiana who will smile and sincerely ask you how your day is going. Then the food runner will bring out your order quickly, and the manager will stop by to make sure you are happy. There is a reason why this restaurant is popping up all over town, because they know how to get it done!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent service. The ambience is chill. No less than 20 Big Screens in the bar. Has a half in and half out bar with patio service. Chickenwings have a nice flame broiled flavor. Definitely would recommend grilled tomato steak on the burger. Makes all the difference and changed my view. Nice wide selection of brews on draft and in the bottle. Definitely a good vibe establishment!"}
{"text":"For my weekly dinner with my in-laws I wife and I picked this place last nights dinner. Initial impressions were that it was a very well  thought out and cool restaurant that looks just about like every other sports bar/restaurant  in town, tv's everywhere, lots of people and from what I saw on other tables impressive looking burgers. They have a burger challenge where you can build the monster burger with at least three patties and if you eat it in a certain period of time it's free. Well, I wasn't interested in that but I am a bit of a burger snob and was expecting a fantastic burger. I prefer my burgers to be medium with a warm pink center. My father-in-law orders his at the same temperature. Out of the four burgers we ordered, 3 where medium and one was well done. What we received were 4 well done burgers. Almost no pink in the center and overcooked. I also requested a side of ranch dressing fry french fries and this is where the real problem was. The waitress brought me a ramekin of horseradish sauce. I have an extreme low tolerance for heat and when I dipped my fries in and took a bite it ruined my palate for several minutes. When I asked them to replace it with ranch dressing [I believe it was a manager that brought the replacement out to me] and said he was sorry. That could've been a serious mistake if somebody would've been allergic to the horse radish sauce and food service people need to pay attention to things like this. So the bottom line is, cool atmosphere, burgers were average at best and not cooked the right temperature and the last thing I have to say is the waitress only came back to check on us once before bringing the bill at the end of the night. It was a fantastic five dollar hamburger unfortunately it cost $13. We will not be returning"}
{"text":"Great place fun people and good food Way better then Tilted Kilt. I will keep coming back"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Erika and Shawn went way beyond normal restaurant service. Will keep coming back until they kick me out forever."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers before, but I passed the place all the time as it was being built and I have been told good things, so when we realized it was finally open we came in to check it out. VERY busy Sunday, we were greeted promptly but it was obvious that they were a bit understaffed because everyone was moving in quite a bustle and most of the tables were full.  Brand-new location, so, of course, you should expect a bit of an adjustment period as everything settles in.  We were sat, and did have to wait ten minutes without being greeted. I went to the host stand and let her know that we were still waiting on a server, and she promptly found a server for us, who appeared .02 seconds after I asked. Mallory was very friendly and had a big smile, and gave us little \"hints\" and \"tips\" for the menu, which was great, and was very knowledgeable about the place. She offered us little upgrades like aoli for fries and cold glasses for our beers, and even though she was obviously very busy, she made sure to check up on us and give us a thorough rundown on what this restaurant is all about.   The food was delicious, especially the truffle fries, and we were also very impressed by the beer selection! The Trappist beers and sour beer selections were our favorites.   The only reason I give 4/5 and not 5/5 is that the seating/getting a server process was a bit bumpy, but of course the place is brand new and was slam packed so it really wasn't much of an issue, in consideration. Definitely will be back to try more burgers and beers!"}
{"text":"Two low carb eaters and one teen go to a bar...and were happy!  After getting on the waitlist online before arriving (yay!) we had a pretty short wait for a Saturday night.  Our orders were appropriately obnoxious for picky low carb eaters - naked chicken wings extra veggies sauce on side, hamburgers no buns everything on the side, etc.  the server was very nice no stress and everything came out perfectly.  The chicken wings were SO good - crispy and full.   Good burger too.  The teen had a Cobb salad and loved how much bacon it had, ha!  Very easy meal and they had the UFC fights on (big in our family)."}
{"text":"I waited for this place open for what seemed like forever. I love the concept and atmosphere. This certain location is a nightmare as of right now. I went here two days in a row. Both times were horrible.   The first time I went here our entrees and apps came out at the same time and before the waitress brought water and the beer. 10 minutes later they brought the wrong beers. Finally the manager came over (super cool dude) and comped the beers.   The next day, my friend said we should go to watch the Dbacks game at CBCB. I obliged and gave them a second chance. To no avail, the same exact thing happened with a different waitress. And we ended up waiting 30 minutes for the bill with empty plates on our table. When the bill finally came, she dropped it off and didn't take the plates. I asked her to take them and she said she'd come right back. The plates were never taken. The beer was free again thanks to the cool manager guy. So that's a plus.   TLDR: Food is good. Beer is cold (and free, sometimes). Service is a travesty."}
{"text":"We were seriously SO excited to see Tilted Kilt GTFO and for this place to move in. They renovated the interior and made it a lot more customer-friendly; the old layout was very compartmentalized and weird. Anyway. Food here is decent for a burger joint, service is somewhat consistent but always very friendly, and they do have a great beer selection. This is definitely our go-to spot to watch sports."}
{"text":"As you can tell we are big fans of this concept! This is their 10th location and we finally got one by us. I have been told this is their largest location with 3 outside patio seating options. Thier food is always good and their beer selection is one of the best in the valley. The area is large and open with a huge bar. The staff there is phenomenal. They continue to impress me. Big shout out to Cindy at the bar and Wyattt and Trevor for their patronage and hospitality. PS, don't forget about their happy hour Monday-Friday from 3-6 PM, it is the whole restaurant and not just the bar area."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this new location! It's bike riding distance from my house, the menu has something to offer for adults & kids, huge open space, quick service, and a great drink selection. I wish people would give this place some grace, it's the coolest thing around here outside of OHSO, other patrons are just as excited as you are to try this place out, there will be a wait. Even when you think there won't be a wait... plan for one. Walk over to Salty Sow and belly up for a drink while you wait for your table.  I've tried a few things on the menu, burgers, buffalo chicken, salads, aioli parm fries, all have been pretty good. I was surprised to see people complain about pricing. In my opinion for what CBCB offers (an all over great experience) they're reasonably priced.  Ultimately this area is not hurting for burger/american fare choices, if you're not wanting to spend $13 on a burger there's a Wendy's, In-N- Out, and a Chili's all on the same corner. Have at it."}
{"text":"This was the best bar tending I've had in a long time. Rachel and Erica are amazing. My glass never was empty. If you're looking for a great sports bar and great service, stop by! You won't be disappointed! This is a new location and it's done right!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I have seen a few of these around the valley and we stopped in on  Sunday for lunch. They were busy but we were fortunate and got seated right away. The table had not been wiped but the hostess noticed and wiped it for us. Lots of televisions with sports on which is fun. Our server was friendly and pretty quick with bringing us drinks.  My dinner mate ordered the bacon blue burger and said it was absolutely delicious- and for $14.50 I hope so.  Dinner mate #2 ordered the Phoenix Philly for $16.50(!) and said it was good but not worth the price.  I agreed as my order of the buffalo chicken sandwich was decent but overpriced. I \"upgraded\" for $2 to tots-which were very salty, and really shouldn't be extra.  The whole experience was satisfactory, but high priced for what you get."}
{"text":"Finally this place opened! I've been here twice since it opened, first time I got a burger and tater tots, but was up charged for the tots, everything comes with potato chips as a side. The burger was good. Second time I ordered the Cincinnati dog, with chili cheese and onions. The hot dog would have been much better if it was hot, same with the chili on it, it was warm. I don't like the fact that if you want something other than potato chips as your side it cost you another 5 bucks. Will be back again to try the extensive menu. I like the atmosphere, casual, with lots of big screen TVs. Service was good, and the beer was cold. A little pricey I thought for burgers and dogs."}
