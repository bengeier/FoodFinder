{"text":"Lovely public, private and semi-private spaces; excellent menu choices that are truly well executed. Top notch service as well. 
Open seven days a week, including an after theater menu. 
Home-made humus and pita were exceptional, good vegetarian choices, loved the ribs. Great coffee too!"}
{"text":"Met my son and friend here before going to play in Playhouse Square. Parked close to Playhouse Square and it's a short 7 min walk. Asian infused menu which was to my liking. I was worried about the kimchee cause no kimchee EVER tastes the same! But spicy with great flavor! I had the Korean Short ribs and my husband had cauliflower and lentils that went well with the Robotos skewers. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've had a couple of things here but one thing that absolutely stood out was the Ohio pork ramen. That itself deserves 5 stars. You would have never thought the words \"ohio\" or \"Ramen\" would go together but I seriously believe that this place is winning the Cleveland ramen war. Amazing. I also really like the chicken skewers. 

Everything else was good but not mind blowing so therefore I've rated this place four stars for now. I'll give this place some more time to win me over but for now I'll only have the ramen every time I go."}
{"text":"Food was decent, but if you want a martini, STAY AWAY!!!!! We ordered Plymouth gin martinis and we're disappointed in how small they were, but that turned out to be the good part. When the bill came, they charged us $19 each!!! That's right, it's not a typo, $19 each. We've been to a lot of great restaurants throughout Cleveland, the US and Europe and NEVER have paid more than $12 for a martini. I don't know what their other prices are like for drinks, but I'm guessing they are overpriced as well. So if you want to enjoy a drink with your meal and particularly if you want a martini, I strongly recommend you STAY AWAY from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Our server, Andrea, was wonderful! The decor is modern and fun, great street view for people watching. Stopped in for drinks (Matthew, the bartender, is the best!)and for the delicious smashed avocado appetizer. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for 'baseball' happy hour before the Indians game. Pretty solid spot for some interesting pregame eats. Beers were pretty cheap ($3). We got the Korean chicken nuggets, they were pretty tasty. We also got the charred shishito peppers which were awesome! 10/10 Highly recommend to a friend. we also got a trio of hummus. Red pepper and feta was good but the veggie was our favorite. The spicy was just alright. They also had this interesting shrimp chips to start! Would definitely come here again and would love to try sushi. Others there got it and it looked tasty!"}
{"text":"The appetizers were very good (Indian hummus a must; shrimp poppers).  Entrees were \"just okay.\"  Service was very slow and I was billed $8 for a beer (plus tax and tip) I never received.  We had to leave for an event so I did not get a credit, etc. for the mis-charge, and the management proved itself not on the ball in that regard.  Not sure we'd go there again."}
{"text":"Matthew is by far the best bartender in cleveland! We had an absolute blast with him. Great food too, very impressive menu. Five stars for days!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner during downtown cle restaurant week. It was my first visit there and really liked the decor & atmosphere of the place. Was surprised that dinner Time on a Friday night was almost empty. Had the Cesar salad for an appetizer- it was OK. Did not have anchovies which was nice, romaine lettuce with dressing and some paremesan flakes. I felt it was lacking flavor and blank.
For entree I had the vegetarian spinach dumplings which were fairly good. Tasted like spinach balls in marinara sauce- good but nothing special.
For dessert we tried both the fried ice cream & the red-cee cup both of which were average. Overall it was a nice atmosphere and experience but I wasn't too crazy about the food."}
{"text":"I heard nothing but good things about 811. I called on Friday evening for a Saturday evening reservation and was told nothing available until 8:30. We got down there early, 7pm, called and they said come. When we got there the place was 3/4 empty, so we were alittle perplexed about that. The hostess and waitress were great. We started out with the sampler hummus. It was average. The pita that came with it, they call it air bread, was great. My wife had the spicy salmon sushi and she said it was very good. I had a lentil legume dish, it was 90% cabbage slaw, so it wasn't what I imagined it to be. The description definitely did not accurately describe the dish. I didn't care for the taste, and I love cabbage slaw. The waitress, Andrea, picked up on that right away and was insistent on me ordering something else to replace it. I went with her suggestion, the stuffed pita (felafel) and it was good. It came with fries that were average. I was a bit disappointed in the place because it is part of the Red Steakhouse group, and it was just average. And $14 for a felafel with fries I believe is overpriced. The music is quite loud and you have to talk even louder to be heard, so the place is really loud. The place is nice inside, I just think the food needs to be improved a notch or two."}
{"text":"Love this new addition to downtown! It has a fantastic menu with so many different things I want to try! Love the Asian fusion dishes on the menu. It's a very cute modern place to get dinner with friends! The only thing I didn't like was I saw a few of the cooks or chefs and they didn't look \"clean\" or professional."}
{"text":"I ordered a spicy tuna roll which was just okay. The dragon roll looked pretty good though. I had the pork belly skewers which I didn't care for, and was really hyped to try.

The smashed avocado was really good though- I would come back and just get that. 

The place had a neat interior and the bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Not good!  I think the owners of red and moxie missed big time here. The worlds worst sushi. Red and moxie are both very good."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!! 

Took 1 hour to get sushi!

Ran out of rice.  

Place is incompetent. Wrong meals delivered at different times.

Stay away!"}
{"text":"There are some good vegetarian options here; I liked the smashed avocado (basically guacamole) and tofu skewers. But the menu is all over the world, which I'm not a fan of. The space is nice but looks like a hotel lobby. Good location near downtown hotels and activities."}
{"text":"I came here for Cleveland Independents Restaurant Week. It was a good deal for the money (I had plenty to take home because it was a lot of food!), though I don't think that the quality of the food measures up to that of other restaurants in the area. Maybe the other (non-restaurant week) options would be better."}
{"text":"Yesterday I had tickets to the Cavs playoff game and was planning to going to mAsthead for pizza and beer. Shame on me I didn't know they are closed on Mondays. Even on home game days. We decided to go somewhere closer to the arena and knew about this newer bar on Prospect. I wasn't sure the name and as we got closer saw the sign for 811 kitchen. What great decision. We got there about 90 minutes before the game and couldn't of had a better experience. Great service, food, and easy on the wallet during happy hour.  After the Cavs won went there for victory beer. The place has    A good selection of beer and booze. The menu is like an Asian fusion if I had to pick something. Serving sushi and fun kind of appetizers. Will be coming back there before and after games!"}
{"text":"The space is totally gorgeous and modern. Great date spot. 

Service was also pretty good. We sat at the bar and really enjoyed the bartenders. 

We only got the hummus sampler but it was excellent. The air bread was so fresh and delicious, I would definitely come back for just that. We got the spicy hummus, the Indian hummus and the veggie. The veggie was my favorite but my colleague preferred the spicy. 

Cocktails were strong and delicious. 

Will definitely go back for a full meal soon"}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect from a place like this where I saw burgers and breaded chicken sandwiches passing by me, all while making homemade sushi and serving shrimp chips.  I saw all of this while I stopped in for a drink one night.  I enjoyed to vibe and with so many options I needed to come back to try it. 

My boss and I had a colleague in from out of town so we decided we would give it a try. (Once we sat down I knew i was going to be very full once I left).  We decided to start out with their hummus sampler, it came with homemade Pita (seriously do not go here on a diet because it is irresistable).  Each of the selections we tried were fantastic, the best one we had was the Veggie!  After that the waitress expressed how we had to try the robata's - between three of us we may have gotten every single one.  The shrimp, peppers, and short rip were delicious! 

After we finished yet another course we got two sushi rolls and then also ordered an entree to split.  The sushi was fresh and not too much rice, I really could have eaten the whole thing but I didn't want to embarrass myself with work friends, and I was really full.  We entree we shared was the roasted cauliflower and lentils. I realize everything I'm saying makes it sound like I am a vegetarian but I can promise you I am not!! But to jump back, it was so good, not mushy or overly spiced, really was a perfect side dish to everything.  

Again, this time around I saw burger and spicy chicken pass me by and I contemplated asking them for a bite, but knew after how good all the food we had was I would be back.  I really don't think you will find something you do not like and the staff was very knowledgeable to the menu and the tastes of it.  

She sold me on the fried ice cream so I may end up ordering that first next time."}
{"text":"I wish I had scrolled reviews harder before we came and paid attention to the person who said they left hungrier than when they left..... how is this possible? 
Three things we tried were not available, corn was out of season so I give you a pass on that but they said the chef said there was something wrong with the short rib appetizer so it's unavailable?!  
We ordered a variety of small plates and appetizers 
But it was difficult because the menu was so confusing. 
Sushi, fried chicken, hummus
So you are an expert in all foods? 
Nope. 
This was a tour through mediocre to downright unappetizing 
The worst was the octopus tacos they were two miniature tacos with chewy octopus, an overly tangy sauce inside or what seemed like an Ortega grocery store shell. 
Sushi was decent but not exciting, and no eel sauce available 
The robata pork rib was grilled but none of the fat was rendered so it was warm and chewy 
Top it off drink prices are not Cleveland appropriate, gin and tonic was 9 bucks cocktails were 12-14
Long story short I want this place to be good because the space is cool and our server was nice but this was the worst dining experience I've had in years. Food has never made me sad until today"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try 811 since it opened and finally visited with a co-worker for lunch.  We arrived just shortly before noon and the restaurant was freezing cold, the heat was not working, so we were seated and opted to keep our coats on.  We proceeded to order, classic hummus, stuffed pita sandwich, chicken nuggets and mexican style salad.  We were served complimentary shrimp chips, which was a nice touch.  Our food arrive a short time later.  The hummus was just ok, nothing to write home about.  The stuffed pita sandwich ($14), came with one side, I chose kale slaw.  The sandwich was huge and included, warm falafel, cool tabouli and other middle eastern ingredients.   I didn't care for the kale slaw, weird texture, color and taste.  My co-worker enjoyed the chicken nuggets and mexican salad.  The menu is very eclectic, but we did enjoy our lunch."}
{"text":"Great food. Quiet Monday night but tried the sushi roll special with veggie and shrimp rolls.  Very hearty sushi rolls, but good. I'm not a sushi expert by any means, but we thoroughly enjoyed them. 8 slices per roll is plenty for one person. Also had the sampler of 3 hummus-spicy, veggie, and red pepper & feta. All very tasty with bold flavors. Warm airbread is different from traditional pita, but very filling. Korean Fried Chix Nuggets w/811 Sauce had a slight kick. Overall very good, would certainly go back in a heartbeat. Great service, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very pretty space, well made cocktails and a killer spicy chicken sandwich.  Visited on the first day they were open and glad I checked them out, will definitely be a destination on my next visit."}
{"text":"This review is definitely subject to change. Stopped in on an unusual night, game 7 of the World Series. So the atmosphere was more like a Buffalo Wild Wings than what I'm sure this place is usually like. I was planning on eating anything just having some drinks and watching the game but the sushi menu caught my eye. I tried the tempura shrimp roll and it was DELICIOUS! So good, I shared with a few friends and they decided to get their own order. I would definitely give this place a second shot on a normal night!"}
{"text":"My wife and I took her parents in for dinner before the Paul McCartney's concert. I wasn't sure what to expect but was extremely pleased when I left. Jen was our server and before they got slammed she was doing a great job. As they got busier she couldn't give us as much attention (understandably) but was always around in case we needed something. I look forward to going back for some drinks at the bar or lounge. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Meh, not that great.  Trendy and modern, so that's cool.

Was here for Game 6 World Series.  

#1 They were severely under staffed.  Yes it was busy, BUT, they stopped letting people in, which meant it was not as crowded as some of the other bars.  So there should not have been any excuses why it would take so long to get a drink.  Waiting 10-15min is not Ok.  

#2  $5 for miller???!??!?! Are you kidding me.  Is there gold flakes in the beer?  $7 for Great Lakes???  This is a great way to get people to not come to your establishment.  Just because you are a hipster/trendy/modern place, does not mean you need to rip people off on garbage beer, and even local beer should not be more than $5 for a short.  

Yeah, definitely not coming here again, ill go over to Beerhead in the Eastbank, where 90% of their CRAFTBEER is $5-6.  Take note managers"}
{"text":"Stopped in because this was the only spot before a Playhouse Square show without a wait because the Cavs crowd was dominating East 4th Street. We soon learned why...food was barely mediocre. We walked away with a $50 bill for apps that included a $9 shrimp robata that was simply a pair of shrimp. Yes, two overcooked shrimp. Not likely to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place when it opened up in the summer. They have a beautiful, modern venue in a great part of downtown Cleveland. 
My boyfriend and I came here during happy hour and sat at the bar. They did not have a happy hour menu but took off some $$ for drinks. 
For food we tried the Korean fried chix mxnuggets, pork belly robata, octopus robata, togarashi fries and smashed burger. All of the dishes we tried tasted amazing!! The bartender took some time to explain what the robata is (basically bbq'd skewers of meat). The pork belly robata was marinated in an asian inspired sauce and was so tasty. 
I thought the prices of the dishes were reasonable especially considering the ambiance and good service we received. I will definitely return in the summer when they open up the windows to the street!"}
{"text":"I love the effort, an eclectic place that would seem to fit into a city like LA. Service was attentive but forgetful. 

The good - pork rinds, crispy and flavorful. The Cajun salt was a bit over powering on some pieces, and nonexistent on others, just leave it off and let the natural flavors shine in my opinion.

The robata was decent noting over the top. The short ribs would have been better with an Asian marinade instead of the curry. The octopus was outstanding tender,and flavorful. The chicken was decent. 

Overall this was decent, not sure if Cleveland is read for this type of place.

I will be back and will try whatever flank steak is on the menu."}
{"text":"First visit to 811.  Wanted something other than my standard Greenhouse Tavern.  This was superb!  Wish I had taken a picture!  The salmon was great and on a bed of something (chick peas in an Indian style) with summer squash/zucchini, and a tzatziki sauce.  Talk about a confluence of great flavors!  Awesome!  Eclectic menu..looking forward to trying more!"}
{"text":"The husband and I were trying to decide between this and pizza 216 and landed here.  216, we will be with you very soon.  Walked in 811 (named for it's address on Prospect) and were seated immediately.  He ordered a saki, I a Bells two hearted.  The beer list was pretty bland, but I'm always on board with a 2 hearted.  We started out with the korean rice stick appetizer.  It was simply delicious.  Great spice and a nice peanuty flavor.  The rice noodles themselves were a bit grainy, which was the only negative about the dish.  The husband ordered a spicy tuna roll and a couple of robatas (dead animals on a stick) and he couldn't stop raving about everything.  I was so excited with all of the vegan/vegetarian options that I had a super hard time deciding.  I went with the falafel wrap, which was wonderful. You will not leave hungry if you order this and the falafel was great.  Special tip, they have a homemade hot sauce which goes really well on the wrap.  It came with a side of nicely seasoned fries.  I also ordered a side of kimchi which was served warm and that was a bit odd, but it was fantastic.  Usually, I don't like restaurants which combine so many different cuisines, but at 811 everything we tried was great.  The space was beautiful and the service was on point.  Considering the area and how nice the space is, the prices were very reasonable.  We will definitely be back as there are several other menu items that we want to try."}
{"text":"We sampled several dishes and were very pleased with the variety of flavors & spices. We had the Smashed Avocado app and the Old Bay Robata for starters....both very yummy. Dinner entrees we tried the Shrimp Curry & Seared Flank Steak. The flank temp was served perfect, good flavor & big portion. The Curry had really good flavor but the size of the Shrimp were disappointing. Atmosphere was very nice & friendly staff."}
{"text":"I just stumbled on this place on this visit to Cleveland, and it was such a great place. The menu offered crazy variety, and surprisingly not in a bad way. Sushi, hummus, Korean fried chicken and cocktails? Sure, why not. Seriously, the food & drinks was pretty damn good. Better than the food? The service. Jen, our server, was top shelf, easily the best I've experienced in this city. My only complaint, the only thing keeping this gem from 5 stars is that their music is pretty soft. I don't expect or want to hear Moana songs when I'm out for Bourbon with my crew. Figure that music thing out, and you've got a real winner here."}
{"text":"We came here on the second day they were opened. Great drinks and really good mix of foods. Definitely recommended. I can only imagine this place before and after Cavs games."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere good was sub par. Has a lot of potential. Didn't know how to make saki bombs lol"}
{"text":"This was the WORSE restaurant I can say I've ever been to. The food was beyond awful. I ordered a caesar salad and it consisted of 4 uncut pieces of romaine lettuce, very light romano cheese, and light dressing for over $10!!! The potatoes were not even edible, and the sushi fell apart when you picked it up. Do not waste your time or money. We left hungrier than we came! I wish I could give it zero stars"}
{"text":"This is such a great addition to the downtown food scene. Everything I've had here is absolutely delicious and fresh. The tuna tartare is divine! My Caesar salad struck the perfect balance of savory and light. They give you shrimp chips at every table and they are so good! For my entree I had the pot of fried chicken. There were 5 huge pieces of chicken! Service was friendly, my rosé delicious and   I will gladly continue to come back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I tried it twice. Once for lunch and once for dinner. The restaurant is hip and in a great location, but it's having an identity crisis. It seems like it wants to be Asian foodie with items like sushi and fish rib skewers, but then the menu has double cheeseburgers with terrible frozen crinkle cut fries. The portions are SMALL and everything is pricey. I paid $22 for rice, cabbage and a small amount of Korean short ribs.  Sorry, but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"811 is a bright modern space with Prospect Ave windows that lift away to let in the outside air. I really liked the design of the space, except for the depth of the tables at the booth - it put me noticeably too far away from the person across from me. 

The drink menu sounds great, the Pick Me included. I didn't like it however. It tasted strong and heavy. The waitress brought me extra lemonade to try and lighten it up, but when that didn't do the trick she happily took it off the bill. Next I tried the Frescas and was much more pleased with the light, fresh flavors of watermelon, mint and lemon. 

The waitress did a great job giving an overview of the menu. You could tell she had tried and seen all the dishes. The only thing on the menu I was unfamiliar with was Robata, apparently a style of cooking. I tried a pork skewer off the Robata menu. I found the thin strip of pork cooked to what I would consider well done, but it was still flavorful. See my photo of this - you get 1 piece of meat on a skewer. So you need to order perhaps 3 or 4 of these to make a traditional appetizer up like chicken satay. 

This restaurant is great for ordering a bunch of apps/sides and I think that is all I would do next time. As far as that category of food goes I also tried the Indian hummus. The chickpeas were really good set in the center of the hummus and the overall flavor was a bit sweet. The bread (all breads are made in house) was out of this world! Soft. Full of aroma. Delicious.

For my main I tried the Stuffed Pita Sandwich, but opted to forgo the bread and get it as a rice bowl. The waitress said you get more food in the bowl version. This certainly appeared true as my portion was large. I didn't eat all the rice, but enjoyed skimming a bit of it up with each bite. The mini falafel were excellent. The rest of the ingredients had great flavor and were very fresh tasting. 

With the sandwiches come a choice of either Togarashi Fries or Kale Slaw. The slaw is a bit spicy, but was my preference over the fries. The fries were good, but were not overly different than regular fries in my opinion. 

Overall a nice new addition to the Red and Moxie family and I'll certainly be back to try some more cocktails, Robata and apps."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful restaurant! 
Attractive decor. 
Our servers -in fact all staff we interacted with - were warm, friendly, professional and attentive. 
Loved the variety on the menu (food and drink menus). 
We had the hummus sampler (Indian/chickpea hummus was incredible), salmon (delicious and a creative presentation) and the grains/lentils salad (also delicious). 
We look forward to going back again and again. A new favorite downtown spot!"}
{"text":"I inadvertently ended up in Cleveland on a road trip. My friend and I arrived on the later side so we looked for places that were walking distance from our hotel for dinner. It boiled down to this place or a Mexican place. Given that I'm from SoCal, I had a feeling that the Mexican food wouldn't compare, so I went with this place based on Yelp reviews. 

I really wanted to like 811. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and the ambiance was really cool - sort of an upscale gastropub. It was emptyish on the Monday night. 

The menu was so overwhelming because it tries to be everything for everyone. There's American food, sushi, Korean, Mediterranean...I had no idea what to pick. Apparently Mondays are sushi nights so I figured I'd just get a couple of rolls. I went with rainbow connection and dragon. I don't know if the ingredients weren't fresh or what it was but the rolls just fell flat. Really lacking in flavor and just overall disappointing. My friend ordered the hamachi roll and only took a couple of bites. 

Maybe we were there on an off night or maybe we ordered the wrong thing but I think it's hard to be good at so many different kinds of cuisines and sushi is not their forte. Just a really mediocre meal to be honest which was really sad. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This restaurant just really gets it! Everything from the specialty cocktails to the sushi rolls and entrees are done with bold fresh flavors. The Atmosphere and staff are impeccable."}
{"text":"I've had a mix of experiences there. Some flawless and loved it, others a little problematic. Overall the food is pretty good, but a little overpriced. I'd be lying if I didn't admit my love for the tuna Rice bowl and guac but the service def needs a little work. 

The environment is absolutely gorgeous and very trendy."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at 811 Kitchen! Walked in around 7:30 on a Thursday evening and we were immediately seated. The menu had a wide variety of options and our server Crystal was very knowledgeable. I ordered the salmon and my friend ordered the chicken sandwich, but converted it to a rice bowl. The salmon was AMAZING. I often get salmon when I eat out and the way the chef prepared it here was different than anything I'd ever had before. The combination of chickpea marsala, cucumber yogurt and summer squash was perfect. 

The atmosphere here is modern chic. Good for a date night, friends' night out, entertaining clients or even a bigger group (they have 2 private rooms in the back). Definitely recommend 811 Kitchen."}
{"text":"Wow- what a cool spot. Atmosphere is amazing; cool, fun, intimate, those are some of the words to describe this place. And the food was great! It's an American/Asian fusion. They have sushi, burgers, grilled cheese, everything! The Tuna Tartar appetizer was great! It comes in little lettuce cups. The dragon roll sushi was excellent too. My friends loved the grilled cheese, fried shrimp, and steak sandwich. I would come here again."}
