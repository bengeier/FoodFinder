{"text":"I'm always excited to try unique foods. I've had Uyghur food before but on the east end of the GTA. Compared to that one, this one is a bit underwhelming.

I had the palov and 1 order of lamb meat. Both were just ok. Palov is basically rice with carrots, raisins, and the same lamb meat as the lamb skewer. I have seen Uyghur food in food blogger videos. In those videos, the meat is cooked with the rice. Here the lamb is just grilled on a skewer separately and added to the rice it seem. The rice has no meat flavor to it. And it was a bit oilier than I like.

The lamb skewer feels like it could have used more flavor. I can't recall the name but try the Uyghur place in Scarborough and you will see the difference. That one is fully covered in spices.

My biggest problem is the price. The single order of lamb was 7.99. It's 3 skewers with like 3 \"beads\" of meat on each. I feel this is a bit pricier than it should be. The palov was $13.99 and this is definitely over priced. I think it has only 1 order of lamb amount of meat.

Anyways, this is still a decent place to get something more unique. I don't think the prices are worth it but it's not costing you a kidney. It's passable."}

{"text":"went there tonight and ordered bbq meat with yellow noodles. The dish itself cost 33.99 dollars so I was expecting a big plate to share. However when the food showed up, it was simply a midium size plate with mostly noodles and a few pieces of meat that is only enough for one adult. I seriously don't understand why this thing would cost 33.99 dollars. The pasta in most high end restaurant wouldn't even cost that much. Won't go back for sure cause the taste is only average."}
