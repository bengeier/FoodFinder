{"text":"Food is good, but the service is not. There is only one diligent server. Watch out for the owner adding charges to your bill, i.e. hot water. Really, really upset about my dining experience as I've never dined at an establishment that has done this before. They actually charged more for hot water than they did for a pot of tea, then when I addressed this, the younger server just brushed it off. At least let me know when you are charging me additionally! Perhaps a course in hospitality would have been beneficial, as well as in honesty and clarity. As an person who has visited North Africa and dined at many Middle East/North African establishments (high-end and modest), this is not the type of service I expected. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Hands down best Moroccan dining experience I've had in Toronto.  I went here with my brother and a couple of friends and was thoroughly impressed by the food and service. I ordered the kefta tagine as my main course and would probably reorder that again, 12 meat balls and a fried egg in tomato/olive oil sauce with homemade bread, my kind of high protein meal.  The mint tea is definitely a must, we just kept it coming. The decor is simple with traditional Moroccan theme accents. It's cozy and kind of feels like your in another country. This place is pretty much a dinner only restaurant as their hours are pretty limited 5pm -10pm. Overall, this place is definitely worth a visit and re-visit. I enjoyed it a lot. I've recommended this to family and friends and would do the same to anyone reading this. =)"}
{"text":"Had the harira soup and chicken fez tagine, both delicious. Food was quick and service was friendly. I'll be coming back. :)"}
{"text":"Good food, great value and friendly hosts.   Been here twice now. Everything is good and tasty. The ambience is definitely unique in contrast to many of the Middle Eastern spots around town, it seems less commercial, more inviting. Good date spot. Make sure to order the tea.  This was first recommended to me by a Canadian who moved to Toronto from Morocco.  Repeat: Yes"}
{"text":"Food took a while. However the staff is friendly and otherwise great service. The lamb Tegine was great."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place following my trip to Morocco. I had an especially wonderful culinary experience in Marrakech, so I was thrilled when I found out the name of this restaurant.  Upon arrival, we were seated in a beautifully decorated area that was actually quite reminiscent to a Moroccan home. Loved it! We ordered harira soups for our appetizers, but we were told that they had run out. Um? Hmm.. Well, that sucks. Our waiter then told us that he had one bowl left, so he brought it to us. The harira unfortunately tasted nothing like any harira I had tasted before (and I'd tried harira in four Moroccan cities, both in restaurants and in homes).   For our entrees, we ordered a few tagines (fish, lemon chicken, and couscous). The fish tagine was superb, while I found the chicken tagine and couscous a bit bland. Come on- Moroccan couscous should be extremely flavourful! Again, was disappointed.   To finish our meal, we ordered Moroccan mint tea. Thank God this tea was done right, because ruining a Moroccan tea is an absolute no-no. A bit pricey, in my opinion, but it was admittedly delicious.   Three stars because the food was honestly just average, and my craving for authentic Moroccan food had not been satisfied. Service was really slow, and the waiters seemed really overworked. They were quite polite, but only as polite as one can be when extremely busy.   Still looking for that authentic Moroccan cuisine in Toronto! Will probably be back here for mint tea, though."}
