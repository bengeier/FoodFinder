{"text":"My honey and I passed thru Las Vegas almost every week and all summer I've been wanting to stop and finally we did and everything is at s reasonable priced next time I would like to stop in before the Buffet ends at 3pm"}
{"text":"Great food. It,s like going back in time. Clean and the staff is very friendly
 We had the ribeye and it was great."}
{"text":"Didn't have the pass that would get me the buffet for $5 so had brunch in the restaurant. Slow service but the eggs, bacon and French Toast were perfect and very inexpensive. $4.22 !"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST damn place to get a good burger! I pass this place at least twice a week, every time I  look at it it reminds me of their fantastic food and service. I recommend The Iron Rail for one reason only......
FOOD!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good food that's cheap, this place has it! Decided to stop here on our way out of Vegas. I've been here before a few times, and it was always pretty good. It's been years since I last went, all the current construction kind of deterred me from considering it, but my husband said let's stop by and I figured why not.
We couldn't decide between the buffet (2 for 1 promo so it would have been 8.64 for both of us) and the Iron Rail Caf√©. Well, a burger looked good to my husband so we went into the cafe. We were seated and taken care of right by the busser Joe within a couple minutes. He promptly brought us drinks and throughout the meal was very attentive, not just to us but every customer. 
I ordered country friend steak and eggs with hash browns and toast and my husband ordered the Iron Horse burger with onion rings. 
Our server Rachel was very friendly and checked on us throughout the meal, even letting us know when she had to take a break and that Joe would take care of us. We sat for a while talking and were taken care of. 
As far as the food goes, my meal was a mere $6.99 and I had left overs! Good portions at a great price! It was delicious  the gravy was perfect and hash browns were crispy on the outside and perfect amount of firm and soft inside. Eggs were exactly over medium and toast was good too. His burger was huge! It had avocado bacon and cheese. Substituted fries for onion rings.
 Entire meal and drinks were $20! 
We will be going again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the Zac M. and the boy to consume many a calorie before heading out to the River Mountain Loop Trail.  Rail Road Pass is old school and damn if the IRC is not just as much! We sat at the counter. Awesome prices and great service!

The menu is full of selections.  Breast fast is served 24 hours.  The Rail Road Pass specials which are served 11 pm to 7 am are absolutely reminiscent of time long since past!  They are as follows....

**Two eggs, two buttermilk pancakes, syrup & butter.... $2.99!!
**Two eggs, hash browns, hash browns, toast & jelly.... $2.99!!

Any special not with standing....you can order steak and eggs for $8.25!!

Since there were no obvious specials, I ordered up a bowl of oatmeal, two eggs, two strips of bacon, and two pieces of French toast were happily substituted with two pan cakes.  Water and coffee were my beverages of choice.  They never made it half full before they were refilled again.

The Boy ordered a chicken wrap and fries and raspberry iced tea.  His meal was wholesome.  His tea never maybe ran 3/4 before it was filled again.  

Zac M. had spaghetti and meatballs with a salad.  He seemed satisfied.

The service was on point and everyone seemed to work well with on another.  Our busier kicked ass!

When out exploring this part of the valley or punching out of Nevada, I would happily stop here again for a solid meal!"}
{"text":"Good food and Great Seafood Bisque. This is like my third time coming here and every time the food gets better and better."}
{"text":"Service can be scary. I've wittnessed the place get busy, and have a waitress yell at the hosting/seating staff not to seat her any more because she was 'overwhelmed'. Loudly, in front of customers....... Yeah. The restaurant is divided into 4 sections.... She most likely only had 6 tables.... But that's the gamble you take when you come to the good ol' pass.

Foot here is really hit and miss. They don't like substitutions, and will charge you a dollar for a slice of cheese. I once had chicken bones in my bacon ranch wrap..... But what do you expect from a place that has cheddar mispelt on their menus ?"}
{"text":"Worse prime rib I've ever had, meat was extremely dry, over cooked, cold, lacking flavor. The baked potato seemed as if it had sat under a heat lamp for a week. My wife had French dip and it too was beyond disappointing"}
{"text":"Very good Prime Rib tonight.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The people were very friendly.  I would recommend this place for a reasonable good dinner."}
{"text":"It is no secret that I am a true fan of out of the way, quiet old school places and even go as far as to seek them out. I knew this cafe was here but put off trying it..... so i decided to make a special trip.

The seating is either at a table within the cafe or at the counter which is a tight squeeze.

The menu looked really decent and there were many things that i wanted to try but i went with the prime rib. 

The service was pretty decent and and i had both drink and food orders taken within a reasonable amount of time. 

When the food arrived i was pleased at the neat presentation and even more pleased when i took my first bite. The food tasted good  and it was at very reasonable and much lower prices compared to the rest of the inflated Las Vegas restaurant options.

Thanks for a nice quiet, reasonably priced dinner. Vintage is the way to go."}
{"text":"OMG! I wasn't  expecting  much when I walked into this little cafe. Even though it showed a little wear in the furnishings, what they had to offer superceded any esthetics. Walking in, I was greeted warmly. The staff came by and asked and offered help multiple  times. I never had to go looking because they were always checking on us. The food was delicious! !! My husband had the stroganoff,which was tasty. I had the prime rib and I was in heaven. You can't beat the prices here. I would highly recommend this cafe!"}
{"text":"The burger was unbelievable gross :-( I was so upset! My first bite was juicy and tasty. The second bite I realized it was juice it was pure grease! By my third bite I was done I wanted to puke!! Oh and funny enough they charged a 1.00 for every item placed to-go. Lol never heard of that before!  But the good news to make up for that experience ... Tonight we ate at the buffet with King crab legs and steak and it was fantastic!!! Will definitely go back when possible on any given Friday!! Yum"}
{"text":"We stop by this restaurant every time we visit Vegas.  My kids love to get Shirley temples and the waitresses bring them crazy amounts of cherries!  I didn't have a burger but those in my group said they were wonderful.  Always pleasant service and good food.  It's definitely a place we look forward too each trip."}
{"text":"Small Casino, Small Cafe'.  They make you feel like you are home.  Serving size is very good for your money.  Staff is friendly.  Your not just a number or a customer but you become family right away.  Best deal for your money Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner."}
{"text":"Dined here twice with the family on our way to the Hoover Dam & back. This place & the buffet was great."}
{"text":"This place is excellent!

I really love the midnight special that's $1.99. This is the first special I've had where I really, REALLY enjoyed the bacon and sausage. The bacon was perfection: lots of flavor, crunch, and a little salty. Just perfect! We got both sausage and bacon accidentally on our order but the sausage was very good as well. It had a nice flavor. This breakfast seemed almost homemade! The hashbrowns were crispy and buttery and the toast was very good! I also tried the waffle and they gave me so much melted butter for the waffle that I was in waffle heaven! I'm glad I don't live in Vegas because I would be eating this a few times a week!

I stayed at the hotel and I tried several specials over the days. I got the stroganoff, meatloaf, and ground sirlion. I enjoyed everything but the ground sirlion has a special place in my heart. I love beef ground with gravy and potatoes and thisplace makes it the best I've had out. The patty was perfectly seasoned and I even loved the veggies! The only thing I wished I had was an extra scoop of potatoes but it is a good value. The ground sirlion meal is the ultimate perfect comfort meal to me. I had a slice of chocolate silk pie to go with the sirlion and it was really good. It had a nice chocolate flavor with a good crust. 

I loved loved loved the stroganoff and meatloaf because everything was seasoned perfectly. These two were daily specials and you seemed to get a lot more food than was on the menu. I would have never guessed I would find a 5 star cafe by the railroad!"}
{"text":"Stopped here again on the trip home from Vegas for breakfast this time.  Our server's name was Brenda and she was a hoot!  Breakfast food was average - eggs, hashbrowns, bacon... my husband ordered biscuits and gravy and it was a really decent sized portion for $2.95.  Brenda brought us extra toast when we ate all of ours.  She was reallly what made the whole experience above average for us.  She obviously enjoys her job and has a good time with customers.  Even my husband, who is deathly afraid of talking to restaurant servers, enjoyed her.

They still have $1 strawberry shortcake and it's still good!  Next time I stop I'll make sure it's at lunch again - they always seem to have a really good sounding special at a great deal."}
{"text":"I ordered nachos, ground sirloin, which came with choice of salad or seafood bisque. The nachos tasted like dog food. I told two waitresses this, but they did not seem to care. It was not comped or replaced, no solution was offered. The best thing about this whole experience was actually the free seafood bisque."}
{"text":"On the way back from hoover dam, we stopped in to check out the casino. Once there, we saw this place and went in. 

The waitress got us seated at a booth and gave us our menus. The place is an older style diner setting with a good choice of food. I ordered the onion rings and soup/sandwich combo. 
The portions are large and really well priced. The food was fresh and well worth the price.
I would go back for sure if there to gamble. 
It is popular with truckers and tourists."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. My mother in law heard about the chicken from a vendor at a craft fair. We stopped in one day after a trip to Hoover Dam. It is moist and crispy and full of goodness. The chicken soup is also tasty. I'd like to try other entrees but it will be really difficult not to offer the fried chicken."}
{"text":"A true gem in the desert, great little cafe with good specials. The food is wholesome and filled with old school goodness. Prices are as close to the good ole days as possible considering it's 2012 and everyone has iphones and internet at their command. Great traditional meals like burgers, onion rings, chicken fingers, salads and much more. The prime rib or rib eye steak is pretty good for the price, but don't expect a super dining experience since it's a full meal at the price of a single side dish at a fancy pants restaurant. If you are lucky you can be waited on by some interesting servers. Don't be in a rush, relax and have a good old fashioned throwback meal. The $1 strawberry shortcake is worth it even if you don't really want to eat it. It's huge and topped with $10s worth of whipped cream! Breakfast, lunch or dinner, get in there and have some Fun fun fun!"}
{"text":"What we had were the delicious hash browns, they're a thicker cut most places that serve you hash browns are the thin shreds of potatoes and ask for them a lil more crispy, makes em yummier. The French toast is good too not soggy just right for me I always douse mine in butter and jam. Biscuits and gravy were really good too. 

Johno are server was great but the hostess was a lil sour."}
{"text":"Hamburger and fries - $4.99 or Prime Rib or Rib Eye for $7.95.  Can't beat that price, we stopped in on our way back from the Hoover Dam.  We ordered the Rib Eye and the Prime Rib Drip, both were really good. 

**   SERVICE  -  The server who took our drink orders is a TOTAL BIGOT.  The guy didn't even look at us when we order our drink and took our order and just turned around and walked away, even while I was saying Thank you.  A little later, the guy takes the order from the table next to us, they happen to be Caucasian, and he is talking to them asking how they are and saying thank you and being friendly, he was totally a different to person to them.  The lady who served our food was very friendly, but I really hate when people are bigots.  Just to let you know, we are an Asian family and live in California.

We did enjoy the food and will try this place, but if we get the same guy again, I will ask for someone else to help us and tell the manager ."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars on multiple visits

Steak and Eggs: Eggs cooked to order, Hashbrowns outstanding, toast spot on, steak maybe 6oz and cooked to order. Good deal at $8.25. 
Three Dueces: Eggs again cooked perfectly, toast again spot on, sausage ok, french toast excellent. Cant beat it for $4.25
Prime Rib x 2: order the 12oz cut: This Prime Rib was a solid 14-16 oz ordered and served medium rare, outstanding! Baked Potato was over cooked and Broccoli was fine, salad and dressing was good. Outstanding meal for $13.95. Better than Ellis Island Cafe. 
New York Steak: Solid 12-14oz cut, Cooked medium rare to order. Ditto from my last review on the potato, broccoli and salad. Very good deal for $13.95

Overall I really like this place. Their accuracy in cooking things to order was great. The Prime Rib, New York Strip and Hashbrowns are the winners."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by several locals in the Boulder area.

Pros: 
It was only a few miles from where we were staying. 

CONS: 

SERVICE...HORRIBLE......our waiter John was as slow as they come.  Had to ask multiple times for things like water and napkins.....he only checked on us 2 times during a 35 minute time frame.....both dinners were incorrect and took him forever to bring back the right stuff.  The really sad part was he only had one other table.  He did however, have lots of free time to chat with his co-workers.  His lack of attention greatly impacted his tip. 

FOOD:  Nothing to write home about.....tasted like something you would get at a Old Country Buffet....our waiter bragged about the homemade dressings for salads.....and brought out Kraft. Lettuce was soft and tasted like it came out of a Dole bag.   Spending $30 for lunch, one would hope to get a little more bang for your buck.  Kinda ticked me off that AFTER we ordered and got our check, we were told we would have gotten a discount if we had a players card.....so I said ok.....sign me up.  NO, it was too late. 

CLEANLINESS:  Well, it was just ok.  Our table was clean, however the table across from us was still dirty and remained that way while we ate.   
Oh and the stench of stale smoke......it's EVERYWHERE.......just because the sign says that it was a non-smoking area......the smoke didn't listen.  I had to change clothes and wash my hair after lunch.  cRaZy. 

******One thing I did notice is that the buffet, cafe and steakhouse all share the same kitchen."}
{"text":"this cafe has SUPER good prime rib. Its not exactly conveniently located for locals unless you are headed to arizona/ boulder city or coming back.

But i higly recommend it if you are looking for reasonably priced decent prime rib.

the deserts, not so impressive."}
{"text":"Prime rib is very good. But order rare if u want medium rare.  Kitchen tends to over cook a little bit. Other than that really good prime rib. Everything  is low priced but good. Chocolate cake is ridiculously  delicious.  As far as ambiance  goes not much to see. Casino has historic value(there is tiny museum inside of casino)  only casino still using same gambling license from early years"}
{"text":"You are on your way back from seeing Hoover dam/ Boulder dam 
( a must stop on the Vegas travel itinerary) and you are hungry.
You see the railroad pass casino.
The sign that catches your eye is 7.99 T-Bone Steak Special. 
It just says OLD style VEGAS.
and ....you are hungry.
Looking like a white glorified truck stop as evidenced by all the \"big rigs\" parked in the lot - the Railroad Pass Casino looks is if it is built right into the hillside.
It has easy access from the highway.
Inside - your vision of \"truck stop\" is slightly augmented by the slot machines and few blackjack tables.
You make your way  past Leroy's sports book and you find the Iron Rail cafe....... Old style Vegas.
Nothing fancy, just comfortable booths and tables.
The T bone steak is very good and the whole experience says \"old style Vegas.\"
The real secret in the Railroad Pass Casino is the Conductors Room - a very nice dining area with supurb Prime Rib, but since it was not open, the Iron Rail will do.
Nostalgic ...... and very nice food - the steak was large, cooked very well and that baked potato came in its own silver foil.
Totally enjoyable ....   
For the price - absolutely enjoyable."}
{"text":"I stopped for breakfast today on a bike ride from Lake Mead Parkway.  I thought riding the 7.5 miles to get here would be a nice place to stop, have some coffee, and a bit of breakfast.

Getting seated was terribly slow.  There was one older person to seat and take payment at the register so things were slow.  By the time I was seated, the line behind me was about 5 couples deep.  I had to wait even though I sat at the counter.

That being said, my server was prompt with the coffee and he took my order quickly, too.  I had a cheese and mushroom omelette, hash browns, and toast.  $8 + with tax.  

This is a fine place for breakfast, and I'd stop here again."}
{"text":"I've passed this place many times on the way to Hoover Dam without stopping. Shame on me! Our recent visit to the dam to take first timers included looking for a breakfast spot. Rushing out to beat the heat, we realized we had passed all of our standards! No fear as I was hoping to take them at some point to a \"days gone by\" Vegas eatery! This is one of those! Crossing the mountain range, with Vegas no longer visible from your rear view mirror, you come across a relatively small truck stop casino. Not much money has been reinvested into the decor, but that makes it even cooler! All the way in the back sits a small coffee shop that serves an amazing breakfast! I had the two eggs, bacon/sausage, two slices of French toast meal that was absolutely a good meal! I might have payed $6 for that? The sourdough toast was fresh and amazing! We also had the 8oz NY strip with eggs, hash browns, and toast for $8! The walls are covered with photos of Vegas from the 50's and 60's as well as the construction of the Dam. Do as this southern gentleman did and step back in time for a quality, cheap, and nostalgic meal at RR Pass!"}
{"text":"service is lacking here and the food is hohumm"}
{"text":"The food was exactly what you pay for, along with the restaurant itself could use some extra maintenance for example, the table we ate at wouldn't stop wobbling, and the menus handed to us had food left over on them. Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"After a decent length stay in Vegas, bae and I stopped at Railroad Pass Casino for lunch. I got a club sandwich and bae got biscuits and gravy, pancakes, and eggs. It was all delicious!!  One of the best and cheapest meals of the trip. Our waitress was really nice and attentive. If you are not in a rush driving back to Phoenix, I would recommend grabbing a bite here before you head out. Not to mention the tables out in the casino all have low minimum bets so you can get a little more gambling in before you go.  The $3 poker had a few $800 wins while we were at the $5 black jack table."}
{"text":"My Husker buddy took me here, I had the chicken fried steak, because the server said he was addicted to the gravy (a tad over weight) ...it sold me, they invented a 5th food group. Now back to my room to luffa my stretch marks. Enjoy."}
{"text":"If you're staying at the hotel, this is your best bet for food. The prices are fair, the food is okay (depending on what you get), but the staff leaves much to be desired.

I've eaten here twice.

My eggs were cooked properly, the hashbrowns were good. 

French Toast was frozen in spots, and I don't eat meat so I asked for an egg instead of the sausage and they said no way.

Overall the food is decent enough, I was just really disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"This location is part of the casino and offers a cafe experience versus a more formal dinner dining or buffet.  They had fun historical photos of the area on the walls that showed the evolution of the area with the railroad and the Hoover Dam.  We ordered breakfast for dinner and enjoyed our meals.  I had the chicken fried steak and eggs with an Iced Tea to drink.  The waitress was friendly and checked back with us often.  Unfortunately, we didn't have enough comp dollars to cover our meal as we had anticipated, but the food was still good."}
{"text":"When I dine in the Iron Rail, I am on the right track to value. The Iron Rail is the Railroad Pass' s draw to get motorists off US 93/95 into the casino. Flashing signs advertise too good to believe restaurant specials. There is a $7.95 prime rib special and $1 strawberry short cakes. That is the tip of the iceberg of restaurant specials.

  In my case, Railroad Pass lured me into the Iron Rail from the River Mountains Loop Trail. I try to support business parking lots that I use as trailheads. After three post-hike dinners here, I am a fan. My meal of choice has been the $6.95 spaghetti with meatballs (not meat sauce). The portion is generous. Unlike the Grand Cafe,  filler garlic bread is nonexistent. Also unlike many of the cafes, the meal includes soup or salad. The chicken noodle soup has been delicious. The cola is not flat. After the end of the meal, I usually drink a cup of coffee.  The coffee may not be Starbucks, but it is good. All this food and beverage comes to approximately $11 before the tip.

 The Iron Rail reminds me of a small diner staffed by friendly people. On all my visits here, they made me feel welcome. With a smile, they give me a choice of a booth, table, or counter. I choose a booth. Service is with a smile, but could be slow. After a day of hiking, I prefer not to be rushed. The ironic thing about this is that I am supporting MGM International Resorts instead of a small business.

 When I exit the Iron Rail, I leave with the feeling that I was on the right track for a good meal at the right price. The Iron Rail will be a cafe that I will return to.

The Yelp Challenge.  Review 43 of 100."}
{"text":"Second time here, park away from the truckers. Service and food are ok-good friendly staff. Had the 4.99 burger special, it was as expected a good quality burger. Fish and chips were crunchy and hot, seasoned well. Would come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and a little play time on our way back home. The food was delish, I had the patty melt and fries. The servers and bussers all seemed stressed out, I think they were short handed that day. I would go back again just to see if it was just a bad day for the servers because the food was great!"}
{"text":"I've passed by the Railroad Pass casino for a long time on my outings to Boulder City. So this past Friday night Joel and I decided to take a chance on this little cafe. 

The cafe is pretty old and has terribly uncomfortable booths. To me this only adds to the charm of the place. I feel transported back to the 80's when my parents and I first moved to Vegas. 

The menu has all the classic diner food you expect. On this night I knew I wanted Prime Rib. They run a special on Prime Rib for $8.95, but for $1 more you can get soup or salad with it. And I'm a total sucker for a salad! Joel went with the Southern Fried Steak with mashed potatoes and corn. He also ordered the soup. 
Our food came out pretty quickly first my salad and Joel's soup. The salad was actually pretty good! It had lots of fresh veggies and croutons which I always enjoy. Joel's soup was almost over flowing with noodles and chicken. He said it had decent flavor. Nothing special. Next our entrees came out. Joel's was filled with Fried steak goodness smothered in a white gravy. My Prime Rib was huge! It came with a baked potato and a side of corn. The au ju was a little salty, but the sour cream mixed with horseradish was perfect. The Prime Rib was cooked perfectly. It was so tender.
Normally we don't do dessert, but Joel ordered their Strawberry Shortcake special. It was less then $2 and was covered in whipped cream and strawberries. Yummy! Super sweet. It was an excellent deal. 

The staff is excellent. They made sure we were comfortable and happy. Our waitress also made sure I liked the doneness of my Prime Rib. Overall super good service. 

I'm really glad we finally checked out Railroad Pass. The food was tasty and the staff was excellent. I'll be back for breakfast and definitely more Prime Rib!!"}
{"text":"They took out the delicious prime rib special and replaced it with a T-Bone steak special. The steak was thin and dry yuk,. My husband had a hot turkey sandwich and the meat tasted like pressed turkey, not good. Service is still good."}
{"text":"big portions at a good price ! The pancakes are very good and big. The biscuits and gravy were huge and really good. The service needs some work though. 4 of us ate for 20 bucks."}
{"text":"$7.99 PRIME RIB or RIB EYE

Catchy ain't it?

That's what caught our eyes on our way to Hoover Dam..
so we stopped here for dinner.

First thought when I walked in: 
\"Damn, this place looks creepy.. can't wait to get out of here!\"

We had:
- PRIME RIB http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lCr_hL-fdo43u_jy9kENdw&userid=Qqj8XMca49wsU1JXiWWwdQ $7.99 - pretty much well done.. w/ baked potato and steamed veggies

- RIB EYE http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qbi28J8XSSv97dmoSGqMLA&userid=Qqj8XMca49wsU1JXiWWwdQ $7.99 - medium well.. w/ mashed potato and steamed veggies

                     *steamed veggies - steamed... frozen veggies.. bleh~
                       baked potato - you can't mess this up :}
                       mashed potato - pretty good (lotsa butter)

Service: I felt uncomfortable..
               are there like no Asians around here?
               Felt like people were staring at us like they've seen aliens or            
               something :P
               I don't know why our server asked how we wanted our steaks to be 
               cooked..
               we wanted medium/medium-rare and they came out well done anyway...
               can't complain though...
               why did we even expect something nice
               for that price? :P

MmMmm...
*burp*"}
{"text":"We went to get a lottery ticket at Rosie's Den, which was empty, and on our way back we stopped here for their $7.99 prime rib special, the place is a little divey but the prime rib was delicious, tender, juicy, not salty, no gristle, priced just right.  
The baked potato that came with it was well cooked; not dry or hard. The corn was canned. My husband ordered the salad and the dressing (blue cheese) was watered down.
So if you want to have a nice ride as you dream of riches and avoid the long lines at Primm stop here, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"It is crazy as many times we have passed by here we are always heading somewhere to take a ride to get dinner in Boulder city or Laughlin,

We did end up stopping a couple of times to play a few machines and ended up grabbing a sandwich to eat but a few times was only for the special they advertised outside a strawberry shortcake for $1.00!

 The food was pretty good and service was not bad but the over all mission was to try the strawberry shortcake they advertise for outside!

They have had this special  for a long time and it did not disappoint! 
It was pretty good for the money!
A great place to stop on your way back to Vegas and grab dessert and hit the restrooms.
Check it out you can not miss the casino this is in!"}
{"text":"I had often passed by the Railroad Pass Casino on trips between North Las Vegas and Laughlin, and noted terrific hamburger deals advertised on the casino's electronic marquee.  So, on one such trip, on a lark I decided to stop here and try this place out.  At the bar I was able to score a nearly extinct 99-cent Shrimp Cocktail, which consisted of several small shrimps stuffed in a glass and covered by mild bright red Cocktail Sauce.  Though small, the shrimps were somewhat plump, cold, and tasty.  At that price point I had to hold myself back from ordering another.

Then it was on to the Iron Rail Cafe.  While there were no burger deals this night, a far better offer beckoned.  Since it was the beginning of the casino's 85th birthday weekend, Meatloaf, Mashed Potatoes, and cooked vegetables were being offered for 85 cents.  Yes, just 85 cents!  I added an Iceberg Side Salad for about triple what I paid for my main.  I also got to eat Diane's cup of Split Pea Soup, which was wonderfully hot and enhanced by bits of ham and carrots.  The salad was fairly simple but filling, with Iceberg Lettuce, 2 Cherry Tomatoes, and a solid creamy French Dressing.  Saltines accompanied the salad.

When my entree arrived, it was good peppery and tomatoey Meatloaf and whipped potatoes partially covered by good Brown Gravy; yet only 2 slices of meat were served.  I could have had a second 85-cent round of Meatloaf if I wished.  Accompanying carrot pieces were not cooked through, and Diane's French Fries were soft and had quite likely been frozen.

But it was a good, ultra inexpensive, serviceable meal!  And quite soon I plan to try De Simone's Steakhouse, that I also sniffed out and inspected across the aisle, for much finer fare."}
