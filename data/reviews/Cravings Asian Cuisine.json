{"text":"Every dish is fantastic. This is our second time here and so far we haven't been disappointed by anything which is quite a compliment to this restaurant since I am very discerning about food. We tried the yellow curry, almond shrimp, chicken satay, spicy Shanghai noodles, beef gyoza, and pad thai. Everything is excellent. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is nothing special. Prices are overpriced for the portion and taste. Nothing spectacular. Can get cheaper and better tasting food at a food court. Wouldn't pay these prices. Waiters are non-existent. And when they do come, they're extremely rude and arrogant. Terrible experience. It's just a cheap restaurant trying to be high-end. I will not be recommending this restaurant to any of my friends or family. Will most likely to tell them to stay away."}
{"text":"Went there after reading Yelp reviews.  Was quite underwhelmed.  Food was a little too sweet and otherwise bland.  

Apps:  We had the chicken wontons (flavourless), calamari (passable), enoki beef rolls (tender and fairly nice sauce), and the lettuce wraps (best thing we had all night--flavorful and crunchy

Roll:  Tempura shrimp roll--very forgettable.  

Sushi pizza (salmon):  It's hard to go wrong with a fried rice patty dipped in soy and wasabi, but the topping was subpar.  You normally get a nice slice of salmon sashimi on each slice.  Here, we got some shredded / dry salmon stuff.  Very disappointed.

Nice seating and great service, to be sure, but the food left much to be desired, I'm afraid."}
{"text":"I just ordered the small party tray through UberEats, it costs $41 for 34 pieces. The party tray only contains rolls. 6 were cucumber rolls, 6 were avocado + cucumber rolls. All the party trays that I've ordered from other restaurants would contain nigiri and maki. Needless to say, I will never go back to this one"}
{"text":"Noodles were tasteless so i complained and all get did was add over-sugary cheap sauce. 
Service is good. 
I've heard the sushi is good however, but I've never tried it."}
{"text":"A trendy flavourful restaurant in North York. Highlight? Pretty good food with average pricing. Fortunately their \"asian fusion\" is only reflected in their variety on the menu, and not in the actual food itself, leaving you to fulfill your authentic experience. 

The service was decent - not the best english so it can be hard to express your order if it's not simple and straightforward. The waitresses were all friendly and attentive though which was pleasant. 

Recommendations
- Green Curry with Chicken - extremely flavourful with a stronger kick than most green curries I've had."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant! They have a large menu which includes Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese and Malaysian cuisines. 

We had the lunch special ($12 for 3 course meal) which I loved. I had the Mango Chicken and my friend had the Spicy Sesame Chicken. The server was very nice but didn't speak much English. 

The restaurant is beautiful and would be a great \"Date\" restaurant. Highly recommended!

{"text":"Ordered from here on a Saturday night, the delivery took about 45 min with ubereats. 

Pros
- Spicy Salmon Roll was very tasty but only 6 pieces for $8.00.

Cons
- Prices were high for the portion sizes"}
{"text":"Whenever I go out for dinner with friends and I know we're going to Cravings, I get very excited, and look forward to it - even if I've just been there the week (or night!) before.  I have never had anything here that was not delicious.  The pricing is fantastic as well - especially for lunch.  A 3-course prix-fixe option at only $12 (or maybe $12.50- forget which, but either is a great deal).  Definitely a great place to share meals!  Have to agree with a previous poster - love the UFO's.  Also, the dumplings are soooooo good (favourite is the shrimp & spinach - Bo Gaow?), and I love their soups - the Tom Yum is the perfect spiciness, and the Hot & Sour is my favourite."}
{"text":"Just ordered with UberEATS 
Everything was cold
The chicken pad Thai contained shrimp and considering my mom is allergic it's a good thing she noticed 
And way overpriced for what we got 
We used to go there in past but it's gone way downhill"}
{"text":"We went to Craving for casual (local) dinner and didn't expect anything extraordinary. The taste of food wasn't that bad (definitely exceeded our \"expectations\"), but their staff and not very presentable interior were disgusting. We were the first clients that came in for Friday dinner. The floor was dirty. An unfriendly waitress in an extremely dirty apron seemingly not interested in us as customers. She disliked answering our question about menu. I ordered one of the signature dishes and missed the fact that it didn't include any side. She didn't say a word at the time of the order, but when I wanted to \"correct my mistake\" she discontentedly noticed that all sides were in the menu. We felt unattended because she was always doing anything (calling someone or just sitting by herself...). Finally this rude, surly waitress ruined our Friday dinner completely when brought us an incorrect receipt. I do NOT recommend anyone this restaurant. There are many other lovely local places to choose from. Run away from \"Cravings\"!

Additional \"Tips\" for Groupon users:
We didn't want to eat like a \"horses\". Utilizing the total amount of our Groupon was not in our plans. Our dinner was approximately $10-$12 below the amount allowed in our Groupon ($50). However, the amount we didn't spent was (still!) added to our bills because restaurant wants everyone to pay taxes on the entire Groupon amount. We asked to correct bill, but it's ended with a disgusting lesson that was given to us by the same waitress."}
{"text":"Great food. They need to compete with Riz down the street. All you can eat is needed at this place. It use to be very busy here all the time....it was dead tonight, all the customers are at Riz. Please change your pricing if you can."}
{"text":"My dad always raves about this place, so I figured it's about time I checked it out. I went with 4 friends, which worked out well since we got to try a lot of dishes. A large portion of the menu is Tapas, so I suggest going here with a small group so you can try as many dishes as possible.

As for the food, mostly everything we ordered was beyond delicious. 

Must try's include: 

-The Enoki Beef Rolls, grilled beef rolls with mushrooms. (A group favourite, and even writing about them is making me hungry!) 

- UFO, which is off the Tapas menu. They are sweet potatoes topped with spicy tuna... need I say more?

- Almond shrimp, which is almond crusted shrimp, SO good!!!

Only thing I wasn't crazy about was the Pad Thai, it wasn't bad, but I've definitely had better. There is a huge menu, and a ton of dishes to choose from. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone. 

**Warning** You NEED a reservation here, any day of the week, even if it's just for two. It's pretty small inside, and I tried eating here on a weekday at around 7:00pm and the place was rammed and we couldn't get in."}
{"text":"Got a Groupon so we decided to give this place a try.

Not a big fan of the food. Service was mediocre. The place didn't seem to be too clean as well.

Wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"This small little restaurant located on Yonge is quite cozy and comfortable. The service here is absolutely amazing. They move with such speed and finesse like you would find in michelin restaurants. They would be right around the corner the second I lifted my head, and never once intruded on my guest and myself during our dining experience. This is very rare to find anywhere in Toronto. Their menu is quite large, it ranges from dim sum,  to sushi and sashimi, to stir frys and some fusion items. Some of their dishes are pretty standard, we didn't try those ones. The ones we were recommended though, were all uniquely flavoured and plated very nicely. Definitely worth a try. Ask your server for recommendations, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This restaurant was great. My friend and I ordered the mango salad, \"everything\" salad, spicy tuna roll, spicy butterfish roll, cucumber roll and the sushi benedict pizza (because it sounded so off-the-wall!). The salads were huge and delicious. Best mango salad I've ever had, with the mango being of perfect ripeness. The everything salad was totally addictive, something about that dressing! The rolls were excellent and the sushi pizza (I'm vegan so I didn't try it) was apparently tasty as well, if exceedingly rich. Presentation of the food was also very nice. Service was attentive and polite. We were the only patrons, but we were dining at a somewhat odd time. As has been mentioned, the interior of the restaurant is lovely. While I do enjoy riz north very much, I would actually return to Cravings as a first choice. The food was of a better quality, portions were very generous and I don't need to stuff myself with AYCE to enjoy dinner out. My friend and I left completely stuffed! Their menu is extensive and very creative, everything we had was delicious, waited upon expertly in a beautiful setting. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Let's start with the big positive: Ambiance (interior) is probably the nicest I've been to an Asian restaurant in recent memory. The inside is refined and decorated with much restraint which is perfect fitting with its slow jazz as background music to accompany your lunch.Our waitress was very attentive, helpful and food was expedited quick

Now the let-downs: Despite having an extremely wide varieties of Asian food (from Curries, Thai Satay, Sushi and Wok-style dishes) it over exemplifies typical Westernized Asian food. For instance, if you ordered anything breaded (shrimp / calamari), it would come in over-cooked and excessive breading with your typical sweet chili sauce which you had eaten thousand times over. 

For a quick lunch spot - I probably could recommend as they would be decent for what you pay ($15) but I certainly couldn't recommend this place for a fine dining Asian restaurant for any special occasion which I believe they at least try to strive to become."}
{"text":"Cravings definitely holds it's name proud when it comes to making anyone's mouth water and their stomachs wanting more.

This Asian fusion creation only opened a year and a half ago and it has has taken the restaurant industry by storm with its amazing combination of diverse Asian cuisine with a very sophisticated and classy atmosphere.

Cravings has an amazing menu with all Asian foods you can think of... Dim Sum, Sushi, Chinese, etc etc etc! This is an amazing idea because a lot of people, including myself, are huge fans of Asian food but love all types!

All of the food is high quality and does not skimp out on freshness or delicious taste.

As well, the food and drink prices are reasonable! This is a great quality because the restaurant's interior has an upscale look, with chandeliers, candlelight and cozy sitting areas.

For my recent birthday dinner with my boyfriend, we dined out at Cravings and it was a wonderful treat.

Our entire meal, which we split, was amazing. Here is what we ordered, which I would recommend:

STARTERS
- Thai Chicken Springrolls
- Dim Sum Dumplings: Boy Choi Sum (Shrimp and Spinach dumpings in green noodle dough)

MAIN COURSE
- 1 Spicy Salmon Roll (6 large pieces)
- 1 Dynamite Roll (4 HUGE pieces)
- General Tao Chicken with vegetables (Cooked to perfection with just the right amount of spice and sweetness)

We topped off our meal with a nice glass of blush Zinfandel each, which was a nice addition to the dinner.

Even with all of that food and wine, the bill only came to around $60.

This place really allows for you to eat out classy, taste delicious food and not go home with no money left.

From other visits to this place, I definitely recommend the Spider Roll Sushi and any of the Asian noodle dishes!

And since Cravings is a more intimate setting, they tend to fill up fast but not to worry, they take reservations!"}
{"text":"The name enticed me, that's what initially intrigued me about this place. Who wouldn't love a one-stop shop for any type of Asian cuisine you might be wanting? It even drew my attention away from their neighbour the 'Burgers Priest' and that's normally hard to do. Regardless, it landed on my list of places to try and one of my best friends was eager to join me.

The interior decor is inviting, atmosphere feels intimate even when the place was packed. Both my friend and I revelled at the beautiful chandeliers adorning the ceiling. And loved the subtle touches in place for the holiday.

The menu is extensive and portions are tapas style providing you with opportunity to a) order more items and share or b) be able to indulge in your craving of more than one thing.

Prior to getting into why I only gave them three stars, I promised my friend I'd include her thoughts. She loved the almond coated shrimp and thought it was the tastiest shrimp she'd ever tried. She also had no complaints about anything she tried and would definitely come back!

I, on the other hand, had a different experience (despite sitting at the same table). Servers were hard to call over when you had a question. They promised to bring out everything around the same time yet my friend had her drink and food before they brought me my beverage. When they did bring out my first selection, it was not what I ordered. I finally found, and called over a server, who told me it was what I had ordered and perhaps was just prepared differently than I was expecting. As I hesitatingly took a bite of coating off what I knew was not chicken, another server came over and said they suspected it had been delivered to the wrong table and it was in fact not what I had ordered. Thank goodness, I don't have a severe allergy to the protein they served me. The sushi roll that I ordered was a sweet potato tempura roll that was packed with sweet potato (win!) but for something that should be deep fried before putting it in a sushi roll, it was relatively raw and was probably one of the worst sushi rolls I'd ever had. When they did finally bring me the correct first item, it was quite good and the accompanying sauce was a mystery but delicious.

All in all, my recommendations:
1) don't stray far from the 'craving favourite' suggestions. Those were the items that were disappointing.
2) if something doesn't look like what you ordered make sure they double/triple check that it is.
3) try more than one item, price point is reasonable enough to do so. Prices will also give you a sense of portion size.

Will I come back? Perhaps to try the almond crusted items which I admit smelled wonderful! But otherwise, probably not. However, my friend, as mentioned above, had a very different opinion and would definitely return.

Therefore, I leave the decision up to you!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here dozens of times because I live so close. Personally I agree with many fellow reviewers who say that this is fast food (sugary goop, salty goop, bland goop) in a fancier setting. And they do nickel and dime with extra sauces and dressings when requested. 

I wish I could say nicer things because the owner is so friendly, but Cravings really needs to get with the program or evolve to join their tasteless and uninspired local competition (like Riz) who will certainly win since they at least offer their subpar fare in an AYCE format."}
{"text":"We were a party of six people on a Saturday night.  We had to flag down a waiter to get service.  The staff completely ignored us.  After receiving our food, we did not see another waiter for the rest of the evening.  Once again, we had to call a waiter to see if they had a dessert menu.  I would not eat here again just based on the shocking service.  There are hundreds of restaurants in the city that would never treat customers like that!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Being Asian myself, I have a pretty high standard for Thai/Chinese/Japanese food.  Upon arrival for the first time, the server (Phil) was attentive.  Sat us down at the table close to the front window and I love their music selection.  Since we didn't know what to order, we asked the chef to surprise us with their menu.  

First came the Thai coconut chicken soup, chunky pieces of meat along with good portion of vegetables.  I particularly enjoyed the taste as I always love my food spicy.  Then came the dragon fruit pomelo salad with crab meat.  Honestly I never tasted something like this before and their presentation was amazing.  I actually had half of the dragon fruit in front of me.  Think of pineapple fried rice but replace it with dragon fruit and crab meat.  Then came the sushi sashimi plate with scallops, extra large size jumbo shrimps and sushi.  After I finished, the server offered me to deep fried the shrimp head for free.  Next came the fish with rice in banana leaf.  I simply love the taste and it reminds me of the famous dim sum \"chicken sticky rice in lotus leaf\".  To finish we had the beef penang curry and I basically put this on top of the rice that I didn't finish from the last course.

Almost forgot about the coconut ice-cream that ended the night, it had real fruit pieces in it :)  Definitely better than a lot of fusion restaurants out there and the price is reasonable given the pricy neighbourhood it is located at.  Can't wait to go back!  Easy access by TTC from Lawrence station, 5 mins walk north."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last 3 months - both times for a tasting menu - and it was amazing! the first time I came was for their 10th anniversary tasting menu which consisted of: dragronfruit salad with shredded crabmeat (Amazing pairing and flavours), sashimi plate - scallop, large sweet shrimp and a special roll with spicy sauce and salmon on top, deep fried shrimp head (leftover from the sashimi plate and deepfried - it was SO delicious!), seafood stew, beef brisket curry with naan. That was back in December and the meal was amazingly tasty and delicious.

This past Easter weekend, I brought my in laws here for a meal since my SIL was in town. They asked us what our budget was and what types of foods we liked, so here are the menu items listed below:

Miang kham - it had a lot of different toppings to go with the green leaves (it's a type of Thai leaf that's traditionally used to serve this appetizer with). The toppings go onto the leaves and you wrap them up and eat them :) super cute, and SUPER DELICIOUS. The toppings included shallots, chopped peanuts, small dried shrimp, roasted shredded coconut, lime (including peel), garlic, and red hot peppers. There's also the Miang kham sauce that goes with the dish as well - kinda sweet and a bit fishy but the best part is you can mix and match whichever toppings you want - we had a lot of fun eating this and I felt it was quite traditional in terms of authenticity of the dish.

Mango salad and satay chicken skewers - the mangoes had texture but enough sweetness at the same time, the dressing's tartness was perfectly balanced with the sweetness of the mango but the mango itself also had a bit of acidity to balance out which just made this salad taste great. The chicken skewers were perfectly cooked - it was dried out - very soft tender and moist and easy to bite into, and i felt the satay sauce that's already on it was enough to go with the skewer - it didn't overpower the flavour of the rub too much. Love the extra touch/finesse they did by presenting in a bamboo tray for each individual person :)

Sashimi platter - the platter consisted of salmon, octopus, scallop, large sweet shrimp, salmon roe on cucumber boats, tamago (sweet egg), red tuna, squid and albacore tuna. The platter was definitely a jaw dropping WOW - the presentation was beautiful. The picture speaks all. It was a lot of sashimi for the 5 of us lol... in fact after we finished this dish, we were getting worried about the latter courses coz we are starting to get full! but the portions were amazing. Fish was very fresh and beautifully cut, the shellfish were all very good quality as well!

Torched sushi and roll - we had squid and salmon torched sushi and also a roll with torched eel/fish. It could use a bit of sauce to help flavour the sushi better but the roll was very good. Overall I felt that the sushi and the roll were both really good!

Egg white wrapped dumpling - This dish is beautiful - I\"m in awe of figuring how they make it! it's basically a thin layer of cooked egg white, held together by a piece of green onion, topped with tobiko (flyfish roe). Inside the dumpling there are diced vegetables and meat - delicious! and I love the presentation of this dish.

Seafood stew - this is basically a seafood version of the tom yum soup. I LOVE THE BROTH in this stew. It's loaded (as you can see from the pic) with clams, mussels, shrimp, and various types of mushrooms. It also came with a lime which i sprinkled on top, and best of all - it's served hot - with a little crystal cube inside and they lit it on so it kept the seafood soup/stew hot. This dish is freaking amazing :)

Deep fried shrimp heads - after the sashimi platter was done, they took the heads (we didn't eat them - just pulled the rest of the shrimp out and then ate the shrimp sashimi) they put some batter on and deep fried them. Excellent source of calcium there :) but the batter was very tasty. i took some home since we coudln't finish - heated in my airfryer and it was just as good as it was when it was freshly fried!

Thai curry beef brisket - this dish was also served hot with the crystal cube lit underneath :) the brisket was tender and moist - i don't normally like brisket, but THIS I WILL EAT lol. the curry was very tasty, hint of spice but it was very mild, and the curry was nice and rich - you can def. taste the coconut milk base and worked wonderfully with some freshly steamed rice :) Curry lovers - you should definitely try this!

at the end - since we were so stuffed, they served us some mini cupcakes - red velvet and chocolate flavours - they were quite rich, sweet, and delicous! perfect bite to end a pretty much perfect meal :)"}
{"text":"Cravings is fantastic. Great service, great price, great food. Met a friend today for lunch for $12.00 fixed priced we recieved 3 great choices from a fairly diverse menu.

Heard others around us loving their prix fixe selections.

Excellent choice. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I came here for a large birthday gathering of 10 people. They had a table set up in the back that was nice and secluded and worked perfectly for a large group. If you have a large group, I suggest making a reservation and you'll be set.

The menu is quite extensive, and you'd probably find many different things you could try each time you go there. It's a variety of thai food, with some dim sum slipped in here and there, oh yeah and sushi too. They do it all! In that sense, I almost want to say it is like Spring Rolls, but a lot better as I must say that I was jealous of all the other food around me. I wanted to eat it all! So that is definitely a good thing.

I started with the vegetarian gyozas, which while good, I think I'd rather order the beef siu mai the next time. I had the Vietnamese curry noodle dish as my entree, which turned out to be just curry pad thai, but that is how I prefer my pad thai anyways, so score! While I enjoyed it, if I went again I would try something else... like one of the specialty dishes like the crispy schezwan beef, or the phoenix nest one (I forget what's in it, but it looked amazinggg!)"}
{"text":"Love it!

I've been here a few times and I have yet to be disappointed.  

Serving sizes are very generous and food is always hot and fresh. 

The UFOs and mushroom beef rolls are great for starters.  

Most of their Asian fusion dishes are nothin short of great. 

Sushi (for a non-only-sushi restaurant is good.  Fresh and tasty.  

They are priced well. Service is also great.  

Definitely worth a try.  You'll probably be back for seconds."}

I'd like to begin by apologizing for this horrendous attempt to draw a UFO! 
The saucer inspired dish made up of a mound of spicy tuna on top of deep fried sweet potato squares is really the main picture that pops into my head when I think back to my lunch experience at Cravings!
The restaurant boasts a rather large menu composed of popular Thai, Chinese and Japanese dishes. I found the seaweed salad and Tom Yum soup to be just alright. Aside from the famous UFO, the spicy tuna roll and thai spring rolls are also decent choices of nibbles before the main course.
Having tried the yellow curry and Shanghai fried noodles (both with chicken), I must say that next time I go for lunch, I will stick to 'tapas style orders' as recommended by Lauren W, as I found the main dishes to be somewhat bland and greasy. 

The service is very pleasant and efficient, and the restaurant is well taken care of. Recommended if you are in the neighbourhood."}
