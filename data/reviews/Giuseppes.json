{"text":"I'm just not a fan. I won't be back. I've been here more than a handful of times. Each time I was hoping it would be better. It never got any better than mediocre and over priced.  If you ever go into a restaurant and they screw up your order royally, you would expect the manager to make amends. This place offers you a side of pasta, that you didn't ask for, as a sign of reparations. I'm sorry, but if you screw up, you make it right, and you give the customer the meal for free. That is how you do good business. That's how you say you're sorry. That's what you do to try to win back the business.  Also, management should never make up excuses as to why they screwed up. For one, the customer doesn't want excuses, they want results.  They are out of business!!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest. Food is good, but overpriced. Nice and clean inside. Our server was extremely attentive to a fault. Every 3-5 minutes he asked if everything was alright. Nice guy, though.  I had Spaghetti Bolognese, which cost $15 and I felt like I could prepare it better in my own kitchen.  My wife had the all-you-can-eat crab legs.  She enjoyed them, be we didn't feel it was worth $30.  I also had a cocktail in a short glass that was very good, but again, over priced.  Honestly, Denny's has better and bigger meatballs for half the price."}
{"text":"Waitress very tentative. Muscles excellent except several closed.  Prime Rib saturated in pepper and slightly over done.  Waitress brought incorrect dish for Chicken Parm which meant an eight minute wait till everyone could eat. Spaghetti dry with very little sause.  When we arrived restaurant was empty,  I now know why."}
{"text":"This was a first time visit with my family on a school night and we really enjoyed it. The menu is a wide range but they do have a flat bread selection that looked good. The menu for dinner is more $10-20 range.   Let me give some credit here...there was a guy singing 50's tunes and some other soft stuff in the dining room. He was very good. He was singing a Barry Manilow tune and dropped off roses for my W and 3 daughters. Very cool.  I plan on bringing my parents and in laws back for dinner.   I went with the prime rib dinner, mashed potatoes, zucchini as added side. You also get a salad. 21 oz PR and it was a little more done than I preferred but I liked it. My W got a shrimp dish that she loved. The kid meals...incredible portions for price. My daughter Jules got the grilled chicken and I was impressed with the quality.  I wanted to point out the server was very attentive(beautiful too) and the owner stopped by twice. So did the guy singing but sitting with 4 ladies will do that. ;)   One more thing for those who drink. The prices for bottles and drafts are very good. A lot of pluses here. Give it a try."}
{"text":"My first review of this place was almost a year ago. Okay, so my friend and I returned to Giuseppe's, thinking we'd give it one more go. Big mistake.   We say outside again, and again, we were the only ones out sitting out there. When we entered we asked if we could sit out, the waitress had to go and ask if we could. Why, who knows, since there was outside seating and it's a nice day. But I digress....  It was 5:30ish and we were both thinking about getting a sandwich. The waitress suggests one of their \"express\" meals, which are served 4:30 - 6pm. One was a burger and fries for $6.99. Fine. We ask if we can have toppings - lettuce, tomato, onion. Sure no problem, she says. No charge. Burgers don't come with cheese, though. We both said that was fine.   Our meals come out - cheese on the burgers. I bring this up to the waitress. She says, no problem. \"I figured since this was your first time (how would she know?) I'd go ahead and add it for you. No charge.\"  Well.....I'm sure you can guess what happens next. Well, not exactly next. I waited over 20 minutes for a refill on my iced tea and eventually had to go in and find the waitress to ask for a refill, as well as another beer for my friend. Then, oh, another 10 minutes or so for a different girl to bring them out.   Finally, we get our bills and are charged $7.99 for our burgers and fries. Again, we point this out. Waitress acts totally confused: \"I don't know how it rang up like this?\" Well, her name is on the check, so she rang it up, but whatever. She comes back out and says that she had to charge us for the cheese and oh so sorry. Keep in mind, we didn't ask for cheese. In fact, we asked not to have cheese. Good thing I'm not lactose intolerant. I am, however, incompetent intolerant.  Silver lining: Even though we were the only people sitting outside and there were only a few tables inside, this waitress was still so scatter brained. My bill came to $11.11...I should have received $8.89 in change. She brought me $11. That's the only reason she got a tip, be it a few small tip.   Here's a tip....this place is terrible. The food is fine. But the service is absolutely horrendous and soooo slooooow.  It will be a long time before I even consider returning. Owner: please start reading your yelp reviews!"}
{"text":"I should have taken a hint when I found a restaurant next to a car wash and otherwise vacant plaza.   That being said, we were greeted by an older woman who really didn't seem to excited for customers. The place was fairly empty, even during a peak dinner time. Again, a red flag.   So this place does a strange 2 menu system. The first menu is extremely overpriced entrees ($38 for a sirloin steak at a bar. ) The other menu is typical bar fare, pasta and pizza. The waitress had a Mohawk and didn't seem too knowledgable of the menu. There is also a strange section of adding \"toppings\" to absolutely anything on the menu.   I received a water with a lemon slice that had red spatter on it. Maybe somebody cut their finger on the lemon wedge? Gross. Didn't drink it.  Then I received my \"side salad\" which was basically sandwich toppings of lettuce and onion with one olive.    I ordered an Italian sausage hoagie. After 45 min of waiting, I received a hamburger bun with about 2 oz of dried catfood.   After telling the grumpy old woman who brought it, this was not an adult portion, she scoffed and walked away.  The \"meal\" is still sitting on the table.    Stay away from this train wreck."}
