{"text":"I moved out of Cleveland 4 years ago and man I do miss those paninis!  They are the most perfect drunk food imaginable.  Meat, cheese, fries, slaw...all smooshed in between two large wonderful pieces of french bread!  Oh how I miss you Panini's!!  I'm coming home this weekend I will come visit...I promise...I'll come even if I'm not drunk."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS sandwiches. My date & I got the cappicola sandwich with extra stuffing and split it, with a side of jalape√±o poppers. It was plenty of food for both of us.  It was a thick layer of cappicola/melted cheese, topped with French fries and coleslaw on soft, thick cut bread. I've had this same style sandwich in a Pittsburgh staple restaurant a million times, but I've never been crazy about them. This sandwich blew all of the previous sandwiches away in a single shot. The coleslaw is crunchy, peppered & more on the vinegary side. The fries are thick and thoroughly deep fried... I added a little hot sauce to mine, but it was just as good without.  Thankfully, it wasn't super busy when we stopped in (a Sunday afternoon). This spot has earned the status of destination when I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went out there on a Saturday night after the bars closed, tried to order a custom pizza and was told they were too busy and could only sell me a pepperoni or cheese pizza. I was pretty disappointed, bought a pepperoni anyway, and even in my drunken stupor the pizza was still disgusting. It obviously had been sitting there for a while, gotten pretty old and cold. I will probably go back again just because they're the only late night option out there, but I will not be happy about it. 2 stars because they at least stay open late. They need to step up the game."}
{"text":"They have some of the best tuna around. Make sure you get there before 10pm or they stop serving it. They have Golden T also!!!"}
{"text":"Well if you have an id outside of Ohio regardless of your age they won't let you in. Our friend had one and we said to call the police over and they responded in the most disrespectful way possible. He was clearly of age even other officers of other bars agreed but because the cop at this place was up the bouncers ass he wasn't going to let him in regardless of his age.Dive bar is 100% times better don't waste your time on this shit place!"}
{"text":"Does Panini's have great pizza?  No.  Does Panini's have exceptional and friendly service? No.  Does Panini's have fun and interesting decor? No.  Do I love Panini's?  Absolutely YES!  Panini's serves as a \"support\" location for your night on the town.  A break between bars, a place to wait for your taxi, somewhere to put some food in your stomach to soak up the alcohol from Velvet Dog or Barley House or Liquid.  Panini's is a required part of your night out on West 6th.  :)"}
{"text":"The food is great and it's great place to tailgate for the Browns BUTTTTT for the last 2-3 seasons, every single home game they f**k up my order - how hard is no slaw !?! It's a consistent they never EVER f**king listen, maybe one day I'll change my review but not anytime soon"}
{"text":"After a night out with the girls, it's kind of a ritual for us to end the night here. Around 2:30 in the morning, it's a great place to walk to and smash out on some greasy pizza and mammoth sized sandwiches. I just have one thing to say, good luck. It's every (wo)man for them self here as we stand around their bar shaped kitchen, fighting for the cook's attention to take our order. Closed mouths don't get fed, literally. The one out of the group with the biggest mouth fights their way to the front to place our order. Don't say I didn't warn you, lol. Five hungry, drunken people..... I'll take a cheese pizza (the whole damn thing) and three pastrami panini's (add egg). It is just so good and we devour all the food accordingly. Just a suggestion, don't listen to that friend that says (s)he's not hungry. Once the food is served, they will be!"}
{"text":"Whoever wrote, \"Get drunk and go to Panini's for late-night grub\" is spot on.  When I read the menu I instantly flashed back to Primanti's in Pittsburgh.  Being a Pittsburgh native, it was officially on...which one would be the better fries and coleslaw overstuffed sando--Primanti or Panini?  Well, I think it's a tie.  Neither place adds condiments on the sando so you're on your own to figure that out.  Panini's fries are disappointing...soggy and limp.  And I couldn't help but wonder if they toast the bread would the sandwich be better?  hmm.  It was great  watching all the drunks roll in and mow down pizza and overstuffed sandos.  And one girl even walked in the bar and hurled in the nearest trash can.  I love Labor Day weekend."}
{"text":"I recently relocated to Cleveland from Philadelphia and immediately heard great things about Panini's bar. I decided to visit with friends and unfortunately had an uncomfortable and disturbing experience with the security guard positioned at the front of the restaurant. On July 9th I tried to enter the bar with a group of friends. My friends and I had visited Panini's earlier in the evening, played a game of pool and decided to re-enter later that night. The security guard noticed that my friend's drivers license was expired, which is understandable for denying re-entry. However, the security guard threatened to contact the police when my friend was not violent or caused an immediate threat to anyone involved in the dialogue. I think it's important for business representation to practice sensitivity and react accordingly to issues with guest, such as expired documents. however threatening to call additional law enforcement when there is NOT a violent or hands-on threat is unprofessional. Threatening to involve the police was unnecessary and unprofessional and hired security should be able to deescalate a minor offense such as an expired drivers license. I would suggest that the Panini's management bring this conflict  to his or her staff  and address it accordingly, with sensitivity and an appropriate assessment of when the police need to be mentioned  during a disconnect between staff and customer in order to ensure experience for all. Thank you."}
{"text":"Why 2 stars? Because the memories didn't match the quality.     ---   ---   ---  Today starts a very long string of reviews compiled from a year of several trips outside the Tampa Bay area. Panini's somehow got skipped over the last time I reviewed spots on my last Cleveland trip.  In parts of 2005 and 2006 I lived in Cleveland and remember Panini's being one of the greatest sandwiches I had ever had. I'm not sure if the quality has gone down in the last few years, or if the sandwich's deliciousness was just aided by a few rum-n-cokes... but it was definitely not what I remembered.  It's kind of like in the movie 500 Days of Summer where they show \"Fantasy\" and \"Reality\" side by side when Joseph Gordon-Levitt goes to see Zooey Deschanel at a party.  Fantasy:  The juiciest, meatiest sandwich that causes me to act like the girls in an old herbal essence commercial. Butterflies, puppy dogs, and the Cleveland Indians winning the World Series!!  Reality:  A dry sandwich, eaten in a dark, atmosphere-less bar, served by an un-amused waitress. My three friends sitting in a booth with me, wondering why I brought them here."}
{"text":"Just came here on Sunday at 245pm, they are closed, no one here, no posted hours, no closed sign, nothing. Pretty damn disappointing as their hours online are noon to 3am..."}
{"text":"Love their pizza! The sandwiches of course too, I like the salami or bacon egg and cheese with buffalo sauce."}
{"text":"Check out my photo.    That's all you need to know.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"personally i find the fact that they put french fries on your sandwich a little creepy.  and the last 2 times i've been there they mixed up my order with someone elses. which they really didn't care about too much because they know by the time you finally order, you're starving and will eat pretty much anything.....which i did!  fries and egg sandwiches=gross fries and reubens=not bad.."}
{"text":"How can you not love this place?  On my one trip there I saw a fight.  A polish hooker with black teeth being pimped out by her mom. A old creeper guy named super pimp.  Throw in late night pizza and subs this place gets 5 stars for me.  Great entertainment."}
{"text":"My friends and I frequent this location on a somewhat regular basis. Even though their pizza is below average and over priced, the convenience of buying a pizza right after the bars close is phenomenal. As of recently the guys behind the bar have stopped making pizza weirdly early in the night for the prospect of auctioning them off at a ridiculous price. Illegal? Maybe I'm not sure. Unethical? Definitely. I have no plans to return this location."}
{"text":"Panini's is great because you can go grab beers and have a good time with your friends here on the weekends or pop in for lunch on a week day. They have the best classic bar food - pizza, wings, chicken fingers, fries and sandwiches.  I recommend trying the Hard Salami Overstuffed Sandwich. It's stuffed with fries, slaw and melted cheese. It is seriously out of this world!"}
{"text":"Have some coke and a smile!  (The management doesn't seem to mind!)  THE UP-SIDE:  This place is best known for it's giant sandwiches.  They are made with thick, freshly made bread and piled high with the lunchmeat of your choice and a giant stack of fries.   Yes, the fries are in the sandwich, just under the shredded lettuce.  Sounds weird, but tastes so great you cannot imagine - especially, after a night of hitting the bars.  THE DOWN-SIDE:  No frills.  Other than the sandwiches, this place is pretty crummy.  At this particular Panini's, I've witnessed people selling drugs in the basement; which contains the bathrooms and is almost always sort of vacant and a little scary.  I told the staff of the incident I witnessed and they just shrugged it off.  So much for me going back anytime soon.  THE SUM-IT-UP:  If you're coming off a night of drinking with your friends, feeling hungry, and needing a giant sandwich - GO HERE.  If you're looking for anything like class, or even a safe atmosphere, don't.  (And no, I'm not over-reacting.  The stuff I saw in that basement area really shook me, and that was during a very busy time upstairs.)"}
{"text":"Okay, if you are going to go to Panini's on 6th on a Brown's game day prepare yourself. I would give any other Panini's location 5 stars for the sandwich alone, but this one was such a mess I couldn't bring myself to do it. Everywhere I stepped I got toilet paper and napkins stuck to my feet, that is if I could move my feet. The floor was covered in such a sticky mess of who knows what, my feet were literally stuck.  There were drunk messes everywhere by the 3rd quarter. I guess it's to be expected? With that said, the sandwich was amazing as always. Next time I'll just go to the one in Westlake or West Park. that's right, West Park is not as bad as this."}
{"text":"Between the R&R Hall of Fame, the Browns Pro Shop and an Indian's game my son and I stopped in for a sandwich and a beer. This is my type of place, light on the frills, cheap for what you get and delicious. Looking at the comments on how good it is after a night of drink and debauchery, I can only imagine that it must be like manna from heaven, It was damn good sober too. First sandwich I ever had with french fries, slaw and tomatoes in it and I was a little skeptical, but I now believe. Right up there with the famous Primanti's.."}
{"text":"Day drinkers, let us unite at Panini's!  I'm totally kidding... I mean, I only day-drink on the weekends. I swear. But when I do, Panini's is one place I love to park my tushy and sip some cold brews.   Like few other places on W 6th, this spot is a wonderful daytime get-away from the scenesters. No pompous menu here folks, just hearty pieces of hot, New York style pizza and huge signature sandwiches loaded with fries. Don't come here for fancy cocktails or they'll probably laugh at you. Scoot up to the bar and grab a cold beer or a mixed drink. Be happy.   This is also a pretty chill place to watch college football on Saturday afternoons... or just the Buckeyes. Seriously, have a few drinks, eat a huge Panini's sandwich, watch the game and live the good life.   P.S. It's the perfect solution to a hangover... not that I have to worry about hangovers that often. No judging."}
{"text":"I rarely venture into this establishment prior to 2am, but after 2am - what a gem!   They have great late night food. You can get pizza or one of their classic paninis. They have many different options include capicola, turkey, ham, salami, BYO, and many others. All come with french fries and coleslaw in the sandwich - strange but good!   My favorite is the egg, bacon and cheese panini. I get it with slaw on the side (as slaw and egg seems like an odd combination) but the french fries add a breakfast potato feel to the sandwich. Great post bar snack!"}
{"text":"Paninis is what it is, cheap alcohol, and bread sami's I asked to have the bread grilled, and the one dude was like sure we're not supposed to  after 10 pm but we're not very busy but can do it this time. I'm like cool. The another dude behind the counter comes by and takes the bread off and throws it in the trash. Myself and the person behind the counter were like what the fuc#. Sandwich was not as good as remembered, however it did the trick."}
{"text":"Perfect Philly. This is like a dive bar, no fancy-ness except for the food. If winking lizard would hire Panini cooks they might have a business. I go where there is a decent beer selection and great food. Panini's seems to be the primo dive bar spot, does that sound right?"}
{"text":"Well that was awful. My husband and I went in there for dinner on a Friday night. It was so slow, just some people at the bar. We were looking through the menu and about 10 minutes later, the waitress came for our drink order. I was still looking through the menu when she returned with our water, so I asked for a couple of minutes. Well, she just forgot about us. She was standing around by the bar talking to the guys there. She saw us at one point and yelled across the bar \"I'll be right there!\"... But she wasn't. Literally after about 15-20 minutes of waiting and waving our arms around to try and get her attention... I walked over to get our credit card back from her. She stuttered over her words saying she forgot about us. Ugh. Won't be returning and I wish I could give them less stars."}
{"text":"This place was excellent! Girls and I had Paninis, they were excellent and the bill was barely over $21. Will definitely make it back here when in own!"}
{"text":"We went to Panini's a couple nights over the past weekend while in Cleveland and had a good experience.  We stopped by here both on a Friday night and a Saturday night for what would be considered 4th meal after a night out on the town.    My one complaint about the Cleve is that there are no 4am places.  One cab driver didn't understand why we needed that much time to go out and some say nothing good happens past 2am but I would like to have my options just in case we start late or want to keep partying in to the morning.    Anyway, we came here twice to get some food before we went back to the hotel.  Pizza is my favorite and that is what they serve here.  We got a large pepperoni pizza both nights with some fries.  Both were good and hit the spot for our 15 minute walk home in the snow.  We never came here for the bar experience, showing up around 2am each night.  They won't serve you any drinks but the \"kitchen\" stays open for some time."}
{"text":"satisfies my late night pizza slice craving and love of people watching all at the same time."}
{"text":"Decent dive bar down on West 6th. Drinks are relatively cheap and if you're a fight fan they usually show most UFC fights. Expect a sausage fest though."}
{"text":"Indian female bartender is rude! Good place though. It's relatively cheap considering it being on W 6th. 2$ for a HUGE slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Get drunk.  Go to Panini's.  Eat a massive sandwich.  I love the bread, the meat, the fries and the coleslaw all on one enormous, sobering sandwich!  http://www.paninisgrill.com/l-warehouse.html"}
{"text":"I went here after the Browns got clobbered by the Texans. Thank goodness that I live in New England. The sandwiches are awesome. And the pizza is addicting. I wasn't even drunk, and I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Best food and service ever... the roast beef is amazing... the staff is fun and service was great... went in before the indians game on a Saturday night.. loved it!"}
{"text":"Don't do it. Not even on a drunk night. .. Just go to bed and eat something in the morning. Pizza & fries inedible. The only food option open late keeps this place alive. One star for the people-watching."}
{"text":"There are a few of these bars around Cleveland. I have been to this one and the one in Kent. I'm not a huge fan but they are OK. They are pretty normal bars with very basic bar food. The beers on Tap aren't bad...they have Blue Moon which I love! The overall crowd that comes here is young because this is one of the few bars that allows 19 year olds in."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink. Not too much going on drinks were averagely price. The Stella on tap didn't taste quite right but they are it right"}
{"text":"Andrew made my panini & it was solid. Good place for drinks & the kind of food you want to eat when you're drunk. It gets super crowded after all the bars nearby close & people want drunk munchies. Go a couple hours before closing time to avoid that crowd"}
{"text":"This served as the last stop for the bachelorette party experience. I followed my partygoers into here and gazed at the crazy kitchen working overtime with lots of drunken clubbers. In my drunken haze, I saw sandwiches and pizza galore. One of the partygoers got me a turkey sandwich. The thing is a monster!! I enjoyed the interplay of soft, white bread, turkey, and peppery coleslaw. It made for an interesting nosh after drinking my weight in wine, vodka, and shots. If anything, it's a memorable sandwich that's damn tasty while completely drunk."}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom.  There is nothing, NOTHING, like Panini's at 2am after partying all night.  The only probably is choosing between their yummy sandwiches or a slice of pizza???  I'm guessing the pizza isn't nearly as good sober, but I will never know!!!  The sandwiches are awesome sober or inebriated.  This place does get insane late night and on game days.  You have to be patient and wait your turn for food."}
{"text":"You don't come here for the bar, you come here for the sandwiches! OMG- I Love them and miss them! This place got me  through my college years.... I often frequented their Kent location!   All I can say is YUM! My all time favorite is the turkey, with everything (which includes coleslaw- not the drippy kind, cheese, a tomato and french fries-- yes- the fries are on the sammy, its the best part).  It's HUGE, but I have never had a problem eating it....of course always after a few beers....."}
{"text":"Amazing Panini's! Super Cheap Happy Hour until 9PM!  What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"After drunken debauchery on west 6th everyone ends the night with a slice of panini pizza to soak up the alcohol. I personally like the pizza sold by the slice for a mere $2.50. Or ask the pretty bartender for a mystery $2.50 beer (I scored a Brooklyn IPA) this place is awesome. It isn't glitter and heels trendy like the other west 6th places. This is a jeans and t shirt kind of place. It's comfortable and unpretentious with decent prices."}
