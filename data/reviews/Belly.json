{"text":"I love this place. Everything is delicious - daily sandwich specials (leg of lamb! roast turkey!), thin crust pizzas, cookies, zucchini cake, a great selection of take away for dinner... I could go on and on.   Wonderful staff, great coffee and the best part - it's right by my house! Belly is the perfect little neighborhood cafe. Just go there and eat something. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Belly is a small catering business & coffee shop that also offers sandwiches, lunch/dinner specials and bakery items. The store is tiny - they might have 2 seats max. But they redeem themselves with great food and super friendly service.  This store is the only place I know that sells Fred's Bread bread. The potato bread is amazing! You have to try it if you get the chance... The zucchini cake is a winner as well - I also enjoyed this one.  Now if they would just extend their hours so that I could stop by after work - I would be a regular customer for sure..."}
{"text":"stomach is too scientific.  in real life its probably all gooed up, feels weird to touch and pulsates and has scary enzymes and acids and reflux and stuff to contend with.  ewwwh you might say.  pot just means your fat.  tummy is when you have an ache or youre three years old or a girl.  but belly!   ahhhhhhhhh, belly.  BELLY enjoys feasts fit for kings and queens.  belly knows how to finely appreciate some cassoulet with some bordeaux.  belly loves the emotional tenderness of the grilled cheese.  belly knows a good restaurant when he tastes one.  well, of course, this little place in parkdale is the belly bomb.  in case you were daydreaming, in case you were embroiled in your tedious problems of the day, in case you havent seen this colour in a while, the bright green within the storefronts sign welcomes you into a quirky little cafe where you can get take-out thats previously prepared or prepared right there.  when i walked in there at the start of my day, i noticed several promising treats that lay on the counter.  there was a heaping display of muffins - unusual looking, thick looking.  there were several cookies for sale.  there was a handful of some rectangular pastries that looked excellent.  i think they had chocolate chips as any self respecting pastry....towards the left of the register was a bag of cured prosciutto. finally, under a dome of glass was this egg phyllo pastry extravaganza.  in it was a tomato atop a sunny side up egg atop some spinach atop some brie cheese atop and within a cradle of phyllo.  for the moment  i had a cappuccino, stirred in the sugar with flat pasta stir sticks!  i talked to the owner, who was superbly present and cheerful and i snapped a few photos.   she, without trepidation, asked what the photos were for and i explained, and i knew that when i decided to eat that day, id be coming back here.    towards the end of the day i returned to have the egg phyllo warmed up in the oven (!) as i waited and talked with a guy who was working in place of the owner, and who was an expert in customer relations.  he talked me up with ease, and continued the same delightful type of interaction with other customers that came in while i was there.  of course i couldnt leave without the prosciutto either.  this is the type of place where i will ALWAYS go before my rehearsals near roncesvalles, for food and beverage alike.  a mans got to be proud of his belly."}
