{"text":"My family gets take out from here all the time. Friendly staff and our food is always ready within 15 minutes. They even do delivery, which is really convenient.  My favourite dish is the general tso's chicken. One of the main reasons why I always come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst place I've got food from.  Ended up getting food poisoning after as well.
They messed up the order, didnt know what ingredients were in a certain dish when asking them about it for allergy concerns. Like you should know if a dish has nuts or oyster sauce...not uncommonly used. 
Note vegetarians would want to steer clear from this place as they do use oyster sauce in their food.
The attitude they gave was absolutely the worst. I am going to try and get a health inspector to give them a visit if I can.

Anyways my High recommendation is go to Keele/Major Mackenzie there is a place called Maple Garden, it is incredibly good and the prices are better.

Go North on Keele St.  Many people don not know that place is even there but its been there forever like 30 yrs."}
{"text":"Bought takeout and delivery a few times now.  The food is good but nothing spectacular.  Relatively cheap.  It is very \"Ho Lee Chow\" Canadian...why don't they just call it Canadian food.  Its quite the insult to Chinese food.  

What's worse, there are no authentic Chinese restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"I always order combo C7 which consisted of fried rice, chicken wings, general Tao chicken and veggies or just spicy chicken wings with a side of wonton soup. It's located in a busy plaza with Longos and the doctors office being the hub locations. It's typical Chinese food, nothing fancy. I normally do take out and the preparation time and service is always dead on. I've been to this location over 20 times now. It's not super amazing but it's also not bad either. Worth an order or sit down if you live in the area."}
{"text":"oh my god i see why they dont want u to stand there n watch them cook.  one of the cooks was cleaning his face while he had no gloves n he was grabbing the food with the same hand that he was cleaning his face. i watched him open all the metal food lids with no gloves. putting his hands through his hair oh god i will never eat there again not after that. i watched him come from the back after having smoked n not clean his hands. he just wiped them on his nasty shirt. i wonder what else they do i wonder why i got sick twice from there now i know. i will report this to public health because they should be using gloves n not wiping there face. they should be washing their hands n being clean. chinese restaurants are know  for being unclean. just like i watch the one at young n sheppard. called the bubble tee clean the cutting board with a rusty nail from that fell from the roof we were doing. oh gosh ever since then i never eaten at any chinese restaurant but i was hungry this time n thought is in a public place n nothing will happen but i guess u never really know how nasty they are as people. i spent two days vomiting since thursday night all the way till sunday morning. no more of that watch what u eat IF U EAT THE RICE IS NASTY DONT EAT THERE IT IS THE WORST FOOD EVER TWISE SICK. JUST FROM SWEET N SOUR WONTONS"}
{"text":"I called this place just now to order cantonese chow mein for pick-up. When I order from other places I always get sauce on the side because, being take out, it's going to get soggy. Regardless, I wanted sauce on the side. They told me it would be an extra dollar for sauce on the side... even though I am not getting anything extra... They told me they charge for the container, but the container is teeny tiny and is not worth a dollar. I told them this, and they were like \"it's more work. Everyone gets sauce on top you want it on the side.\" You have to be joking me. Needless to say, I cancelled my order."}
{"text":"Maple dragon is a great Chinese take out or eat in restaurant.  My favorite order is the sesame chicken with 'skinny' noodles.  I have never tasted sesame chicken  that taste so fresh before.  They cook your food to order so it is not sitting around and served stale.  

The prices are reasonable and the menu selection is vast.  The owner is the best.  He always has a smile on his face and he is very personable.  If you are in the area and are craving Chinese food check out maple dragon.  I promise that you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a place to go to for their lunch special $6.95 Monday to Sunday between 11-3pm. It's not the greatest Chinese food I've had. It's something I go to if I'm hung over and want something hot and greasy. 
I've gotten their Kung Pao chicken, Veg with Garlic Sauce, Beef with Broccoli and vegetarian shanghai curried noodles. Their lunch special comes with chicken fried rice or white rice and an egg roll or can of pop. Again, it's a good deal when you get their lunch special because you feel like you aren't wasting your money if you don't like what you are eating. Portions are 2 meals in 1."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food.  Great for delivery or pick up.  Very good service and prices.  Always fresh and good tasting."}
{"text":"Sesame Chicken(Lunch Special) - Doughy with limited amount of Chicken and it came with an orange Sweet & Sour Sauce, only a sprinkle of Sesame.  I used to be okay with Canadian style Sesame Chicken but not anymore.

Note to self: If ever I go back for that Cheap-Fast-Filling combination, please stick to the following items that do not need Deep Frying.

L5. Beef Broccoli
L7. Chicken Mix Vegetables"}
{"text":"This place is filthy. Stale pieces of chicken were added to a mix of rotten veggies and advertized as a Kung Pao Chicken. Rice was overcooked mush. No service. Anti-social workers. Terrible food. Non-existent service. Avoid."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant.  It will have your order ready within 10 minutes.  If I'm ever working from home or just don't have time to cook, this is very quick and feasible option.  The other day, I placed an order for a slightly spicy meal and went home.  I found the meal too spicy for my taste so I asked if I could get a milder version.  They just asked me to bring the original meal back & they provided me a fresh meal according to my liking within 10 minutes.  Now, that's good customer service.  By the way, the prices are pretty good during lunch time.

I really like L9:  General Tso's Chicken lunch special.  Too bad there isn't any vegetables in that dish."}
{"text":"Hit this place on Thanksgiving Monday, after getting home from a weekend away. Didn't feel like cooking...decided to try this place.
Here's the lowdown:
1) It's in a plaza on the north side of Major Mac, where the Longo's and Dollar Store are. If I hadn't seen the sign out front, I never would have known it was here.
2) Food isn't authentic (or in the vicinity of authentic) Chinese food...it's the Americanized version of Chinese food. Bland, bland, bland.
3) Didn't eat in as it had zero personality. It was clean...just not inviting. Ordered food and took it home.
4) Food isn't bad....there was absolutely nothing that we ordered that stood out. Disappointed as I could have hit Asian Legend in the plaza across the street. I now know better.
5) I heard the female cashier ask other ppl who came in to order take out how spicy they wanted their food. The male cashier who took our order never gave us the option of changing the heat factor. Food is pretty bland...heat may have helped it.
6) Female staff who brought our food out to us (as we waited) was friendly.

We ordered:
A) Chicken Fried Rice -  Zero flavour, zero reason to order it again. Cooked ok...just absolutely no flavour to it all
B) Pork Chop Suey - bland. Nothing to write home about. Nice pieces of shredded pork in it, but again, pretty bland
C) Kung Pao Chicken - listed on the menu as spicy, it was anything but. Huge disappointment. Proper amount of chicken in dish, just pretty bland.
D) Chili Beef - listed on the menu as spicy...it had just a bit of heat to it. Beef was chewy, would not order again. This dish was the most flavourful of what we got.
E) Spring Roll - basic fare
F) Steamed Rice (came with meal)...perhaps the best thing we had....as it wasn't a disappointment. How sad is that?

Would I go back? Nope."}
