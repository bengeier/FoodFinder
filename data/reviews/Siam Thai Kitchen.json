{"text":"Siam Thai's food is very flavorful but the cook was too heavy handed with the spice level. We asked for 1 on their scale of 5; we got a 3. (I can eat it but my sister could not finish her share.) Reading other reviews it appears the cook is not consistent with the spice. No one wants something they've paid for to be so hot it's inedible. Other Thai restaurants do a better job of cooking to their scale. I thought the prices were fair and our take out order came quickly. The owner seems like a nice lady. She expressed her concern that they are not as busy as they thought they would be so I wish her luck. My sister & I won't be back; not a good match for our desired style of Thai."}
{"text":"Food was delicious I had the Yellow curry 2 hot level!! Delicious, we also had the Mongolian chicken, had lots of meat, yummy!!  Also had wontons for the appetizer and ordered the sweet n sour chicken !!!! Very good food, very good service!!!!"}
{"text":"I Have been there several Times when they first opened the food was good and nice portion for the money went back a couple days ago and the portion size has been cut in half and they must have a new chef because the food tasted Completely different if they want to stay open they have to be consistent"}
{"text":"Amazing food..we did dine in but they also have drive-thru service available. The staff is super friendly and willing to accommodate any special request."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I discovered this restaurant here in Las Vegas because I love Thai food. Ordered the pad Thai, tom yum soup, and fried rice - all were so delicious! Customer service is excellent as well. Definitely coming back here next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I always get the pepper steak when i come here. Love it just wish they put more steak than vegetables."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food. Went to another pin kaow more expensive and lower quality. This place has much better quality and better price."}
{"text":"I drive by this place pretty regularly and thought tonight is the night I try them out.  I pulled over and immediately came to yelp looking for reviews and was happy with so many positives.  I parked and asked if I could see a menu since my children were asleep in the car.  They quickly handed me one and I began figuring out what I wanted to order.  I drive up to the window and placed my order and began to wait. 

I was handed a cup of ice water while I waited and thought that was nice of them... Now I know why.  My order of veggie pad Thai and fried egg rolls took 25 or so minutes!  I didn't mind waiting too much since my children were napping and needed the sleep.  When the girl delivers my order I was told I should have called in since tonight was busy... As I drove off I decide to check it and see I only got four egg rolls when the menu says five pcs.  I drive back and asked about it and was given attitude.  Basically I was told all their regulars knew it was only four pieces and the menu board said four pieces so I should have known it was four even though the menu they gave me minutes before I ordered said five.  After that I asked for a refund of the egg rolls as I didn't appreciate being blamed for their mistake and me not knowing the correct amount.  We came to an agreement that I would get one more egg roll and no refund.  I saw the woman put something in the microwave and was hoping that was not my egg roll.  She checked out the to go menus and made a comment that now she will have to change the menus and I'm the only one who has ever had a problem with it.  She then went out to the menu board and came back and said that the menu board and the non to go menus all say four and that they will give me an extra egg roll this time but wouldn't next time.  ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?????  She acted as if I was trying to screw them over  (one egg roll mind you) and it was all my fault.  At that point I was done.   I told them I wanted a refund and handed back the food.  Basically 30 minutes wasted and no food to show for it.  I was really looking forward to supporting a local business tonight, but with so much attitude and blame on a customer, that didn't happen.  I'm a very honest person and was not rude to them in any way.  If the menu I'm handed says five pieces I expect to see five pieces.  There was no reason for them to be rude to me in any way over this.  Needless to say, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Okay, so it used to be a fast food restaurant, and it still has a drive thru. Actually kind of nice if you order takeout you don't even have to get out of your car. But we were eating in tonight. Decor is minimal but clean. Ordered pad kee mao and spicy basil with chicken. Both at a heat level 2. I like spicy but since we haven't been here before we decided to play it safe. So glad we did. Most places this heat level would be a 4. Any spicier and it would have been too hot. But both dishes were delicious. Fresh veggies, white meat chicken and freshly cooked with the veggies still crisp tender. Very good. Service was very good but we were the only ones dining in so I wouldn't expect less. Our water glasses stayed full. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been there yesterday for the first time.
It's small place.. but with great people and great flavors!!!!
I ordered the Green Curry with Tofu & Veggies and it was delicious!  

I may go again, today, for decent Dinner :)"}
{"text":"We stopped in to try Siam Thai Kitchen yesterday, and we are glad we did.  My husband had Spicy Basil Pork and loved it.  I had yellow curry which was absolutely delicious.  The wontons were wonderful, too.  The menu includes lunch specials that are inexpensive (really, about the same price as McDonalds) with wontons and an egg roll.  Both their dinner and lunch menus are extensive.  The service and cleanliness were excellent, as well.  We can't wait to try more dishes.  If supporting local business owners while getting tasty food at a good price is important to you, stop in and give this restaurant a try!"}
{"text":"Really good pad thai. Yellow curry was good as well. Wife tried to order BBQ chicken but got talked or of it by the server. Maybe next time. She enjoyed her curry. Will be back."}
{"text":"I got the spicy basil with sliced beef & this is my new favorite thai place.. Good portions, Good price,  & Good Food.. I definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Ordered pad Thai lunch special to go. 1st mistake.  Not checking it before I left.  Egg roll and won ton looked like It was from the day before.  Started turning that dark greasy color.  Salad was a wedge cut from a head of lettuce and nothing else.. How generous of you to put so much effort into your customers meals. I laughed when I saw this meal. On a scale from 1-10 heat I ordered 3 and it was inedible..  Mistake 2.  Not going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Since I love Thai food very much, I always keep looking for new places to try. I found this place couple months ago and have been coming here very often ever since. It is quite a drive from where I live but their consistent food quality, reasonable prices and friendly services are well worth it. I haven't tried everything on the menu but so far my favorites and recommendations to you are the papaya salad, pineapple fried rice, tom yum soup and chicken prik king. Their portions are generally bigger than most Thai places while the prices are approximately the same or cheaper. Also, their Thai Iced Tea Bucket is an amazing deal: a giant cup of delicious Thai tea for only $5. Try it and you won't regret it! :)"}
{"text":"This place is incredible, especially when compared to the other restaurants in the area. There is not that much good stuff around here, and I wish I would have discovered this place six months ago.

They have thai tea for only $2.50. It is as good as any I've had. 

Curry was really good. I ordered it spicy level 5 because I wanted to hallucinate from eating thai peppers. Did not disappoint, I am tripping balls on how hot it was. Probably shouldn't have driven home, but there's no breathalyzer for thai tea and ghost pepper.

Only thing that was a little odd was they charged extra for extra rice. I kind of thought that was like bread at any other restaurant. But whatever, compared to the other stuff around here, this place was amazing."}
{"text":"Thai food with a drive thru? That's different.

Haven't tried that method yet, but called in an order for pick up and it was ready in a very-reasonable 15 minutes. Pricing is mostly pretty good, but I found the $8/bowl tom kha a bit steep- portion size was good but can't imagine what a large must look like or how they pack it to go.

Garlic black pepper chicken dish, spice level 3, is quite good- served with an ample portion of white rice, well priced at about $10. Lunch specials really are the way to go though, at $7/ea with several entree choices, plus soup or salad, egg roll, and won ton. 

Service is friendly, seems to be family-run, restaurant dining room is small but clean."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times in the past year. Last nights meal and owners attitude convinced me to find a new Thai food spot. We usually 3-4 items some new, some favorites, but all at the same spice level. Last night the cook went heavy handed on the red chili flakes and rendered it inedible for us. Brought it to the attention of the owner at was told essentially Thai food is hot and it is what it is. For me it means going somewhere else."}
{"text":"We have ordered through the drive-through many times before, and it's been decent service and decent food.  However, the last two times have been excessive for the wait time, and today will be the last time we ever go there.  The food is decent, as I said, but for the price, you can actually go down the street for better ambiance and much faster service.

We literally sat in the car waiting for the order of pad thai, potstickers, and fried banana with sweet sticky rice for 45 minutes!!!  Many times I thought, \"This is ridiculous.  Let's just go.\"  But after you've paid and made the time investment, if you leave, you will still be hungry, so we continued to wait.  

When we ordered, she said it would be a few minutes longer, but she should have been very clear about what that meant.  It wasn't until 30 min of waiting and rang the buzzer that she told me there was a large order right before ours and that it would be five more minutes.  15 minutes later, our food was finally presented, along with two free cans of Coke and an apology.  Gee, what a generous offer.  Plus, we don't drink sodas.  She offered two bottles of water instead and apologized and said one of the chefs was out sick and didn't show.

Well, I understand staffing problems.  The biggest problem I have with what occurred is that she should have been honest at the beginning and said that it would be 45 mins before we could get our order due to staff shortage, large orders, etc.  I would have accepted that and chosen a different place that would fit my schedule.  But this seemed to be dishonest and greedy, as I had already paid and included a tip and was stuck sitting at an empty drive-through window.

Do not appreciate the way it was handled, felt very insulted by the offer of Cokes at the END of the 45-minute wait, and will not be going back."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Siam for a quick bite in between errands. I've never seen a Thai place with a drive through. Not that it deterred me. 

I was a bit annoyed that they wouldn't allow me to order the lunch special at 2:58 pm when it ended at 3:00 pm. I would understand if it was a special separate menu, but it's the same stuff you find on the regular menu. 

Regardless, I ordered the cucumber salad and pad woon sen with pork. Both were tasty, and aside from the lunch special thing the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite Thai restaurants. So I was disappointed about the service and the food. There were not  many people in the restaurant yet we had to ask for service. Twice. We ordered a dinner for two. The chicken skewers were ok but perhaps a bit dry.  The soup was awful. It was full of lemongrass bits that were hard like pieces of wood. And I know lemongrass is a flavoring but for heavens sake, there must have been 30 little rounds of tough lemongrass floating there that was hard to avoid and got in my teeth. The server just shrugged and  didn't even offer a replacement or an apology. I sent it back less than half eaten. My friends soup didn't have so many bits of lemongrass. The rice was a bit more sticky than I am used to but I actually liked that.  and the chicken stir fried with broccoli was very fresh and tasty  but the pad Thai was barely ok and also rather dry. The serving sizes were good.  I am not planning to go back. There are many great Thai restaurants in Ottawa."}
{"text":"Spotlessly clean, smells like heaven. 
The walls are pretty beige with thoughtful welcoming symbols and sayings you are always greeted with such a beautiful culture. 
And quite lovely food. Although a quick place served in not so fancy to go containers, Siam Thai infamous Thai Drive thru window, the presentation is always quite lovely and pleasing. 
I am a fan of panang and pad Thai. 
I don't eat a lot of meat but the seafood here is fair weather. So be a little adventurous. The price tag is fair. The food is fast.  The service is endearing and more than adequate. I love the chatter and everyone is very happy. 
Siam Thai is more than a safe bet. Its definitely a staple of quick and easy food that is satisfying and guilt free in most cases of you skip dessert :)

We got the appetizer platter tonite. Two orders of pad Thai, one spicy with shrimp one veggie tofu,mochi and Thai tea appetizers drinks dinner and dessert for around 40 bucks to go eat in our own home. I spend that much a the store so.etimes cooking myself. Minus the Thai tea :)"}
{"text":"On our way to a late movie at the AMC, husband and I had enough time to grab some food before it started. Looked at a couple places in the area and stumbled into this hut like restaurant. First impression:  Teeny tiny little dining area kinda like a small apartment and the kitchen is the next room over. Husband is a big guy, offensive line man big so he looked like a giant sitting at one of their tables - We giggled while he tried to delicately spoon the sweet and sour sauce from the cute dish onto crab rangoons with the teeny little spoon provided. The menu is good with basics and some nice additions like mango sticky rice for dessert and thai coffee. The food is really tasty; pad thai was on point, took me back to my vacation in Phuket. Green curry we asked for shrimp and they did not disappoint, there were at least 10 good sized shrimp in the regular serving. Chicken satay was freshly grilled in the room next door, delicious and not dry like some places. What really struck us was the cleanliness, this place sparkles! Service was fast attentive and friendly. The only thing I didn't like, and this sounds odd, but there wasn't any music playing or any background noise. With a place this tiny you can hear yourself breath and your partner making mouth noises you wouldn't normally notice! Other than that, this place is a great take out joint with awesome authentic food- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time, ordered Pad Thai, Tom Yum, and Thai Iced Tea to go. The staff were helpful and courteous. The food was all fantastic, flavorful and fresh. I will for sure be stopping back soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly atmosphere. The price was just right and the taste was great. Don't let the out side appearance deter you"}
{"text":"Very good food. The service was spectacular. I had the lunch green curry and my sister had the lunch pad Thai. Both came with salad, egg roll and a rangoon. A lot of food and the pricing is reasonable, cheap actually. 2 lunch specials and a soda came out to be just 16 something. My curry was deliciously but the pad Thai was slightly too sweet tasting to me. Overrall, it as good. Would come again."}
{"text":"The food was ok. . The service was not so good.  Make sure you bring cash if you're the only one eating the lunch special. She won't charge your card unless it's $10 or more."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since tgeir opened. I enjoy having this restaurant so close to my house. I Love their food. Service is good too!!!"}
{"text":"We couldn't read the picture of the menu so we ordered based on what other reviewers ordered.  I'm not sure what the first reviewer meant by prices being \"dirt cheap\" because I found the prices to be about the same (maybe $1 less on most items), however EVERYTHING was excellent!  We ordered Tom Yum w/shrimp, Pad Pak w/beef, Pad Thai (authentic-finally!!), Garlic Pepper w/Chicken (fantastic), Papaya Salad, and Mango Sticky Rice (so yummy).  I didn't realize the Mango Sticky Rice was a dessert but I'm so glad other people recommended it because it was delicious.  I just ate it for breakfast a few minutes ago.  
  
The Tom Yum with Shrimp was very tasty and was slightly sweet which is different than I've ever had.  My only complaint is that nothing was as spicy as I like.  I ordered everything 4 and 5 out of 5.  Most new places I go to don't make the food as fiery spicy as I like it because they are used to the wimpy people (j/k) who can't handle spicy food.  I'll just let them know I want it like much spicier next time.  The owner IS incredibly sweet and we are looking forward to going back. 

They don't have a website so I'll post pictures of their menu that you can hopefully read.  I never take pictures of my food, sorry.

UPDATE: I'm sad to report that we ordered from here a few more times and the food seems to be inconsistent. The last time everything we ordered was under-seasoned and bland (pad woon-sen, pad thai, garlic pepper chicken, tom yum soup and curry) and NOTHING was spicy even though I ordered 4 out of 5 and 5's on a few things. I thought Thai restaurants had Thai chili peppers that can be added to make things spicy. I was very disappointed in the quality of seasoning and lack of flavor this last time. Hopefully they can get things more consistent with the cook."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Use to go weekly when I lived on this side of town. Family is great, portions are plentiful (unlike Archi's). Panang Curry is wonderful and my staple!"}
{"text":"I've lived in this area a long time and am always looking for good places close by.  So I think this is the old TCBY building and it might have been a Mexican spot for a while..       Our server was real nice and very helpful.  They serve their soda from a can so its much tastier, but my iced tea was a little on the bitter side..  The crab rangoons came out fast!  They were really nice and a good combination of cream cheese and crab..  I liked the sauce a lot and thought it was a lil sweet!  My friend had the pad Thai and it was really yummy!! #2 hot was good but definitely could feel a tad burn!!  I got the basil entree sorry I can't remember the name because the server suggested so I don't know what meat as well im not sure if I specified but I wasn't really happy with her suggestion it wasn't my flavor but it was still good!!  I can't wait to come back for the lunch special 11-3 weekdays"}
{"text":"Place is good they are just stingy with the food"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the area! I've eaten here numerous times and everything I've had has been top notch. Try the yellow curry and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very small meat portions, great homemade sweet and sour sauce, next time Im going to Panda."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's very convenient with their drive thru especially on a busy day. I love their Thai iced tea! I definitely give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Cute little place staff was very friendly. We had the yellow curry (spicy - 1), good size portion. Drunken Noodles (spicy - 3) next time I will add a little more kick to it but had awesome flavor. 
Third time at a Thai restaurant and first time they brought out a condiment tray to moderate your heat. Definitely will be back, oh yeah and they're have a drive-thru!!!!
Thanks Aarika M for suggesting this place"}
{"text":"Well I think they are very authentic and the price is not bad I recommend the lunch special to introduce yourself to their menu"}
{"text":"Great little Thai restaurant. Food is great and was ready very quickly. If you plan on ordering your food for pickup you can use the drive-thru to get it. Noodle dishes are great here"}
{"text":"Excellent!! The food is fresh and incredibly tasty. They are now in regular lunch rotation at work."}
{"text":"This food is better then alot of the little thai good places in vegas. 
For a quick find and drive through ready dinner. 
Price could be a little better though. 
This place would be a 5 * if! The management was nicer & had customer service!  
The Thai tea is good. And the sticky rice with mango is worth it."}
{"text":"WARNING .... order a little less spice than normal... they are mostly spicy.  
okay as of right now, the food and prices are great! even portions are great.
just what they should be. so far food has been hot every time & i swear they have the best sticky rice & thai iced tea.

but! the only reason im taking away a star is the customer service. the owner truly doesnt understand what that is. she is rude and i almost didnt go back over her. 
the young kid that works there makes up for it though. always a smile and always fun.

i also dont care for how they only \"some times\" deliver. that sucks."}
{"text":"Only a few tables which is odd cause the food is awesome and could not have been faster. I swear we waited under 5 mins and everything was perfect! 

Best thai tea in vegas.

I tried the Garlic and black peppered Duck, everyone's head turned once it came out of the kitchen, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good solid Thai food! I have been here several times and am always very satisfied. Not the absolute best but a strong contender."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area from a few miles away, and while moving saw this place a few times and decided to try it. I popped on yelp and glanced at a couple reviews to make sure it wasn't a mistake, and it definitely wasn't.

Don't be put off by the tiny building, drive thru, or spartan design of the interior. 

-Very clean. The tables and chairs are spotless, and the staff clearly takes care to keep the place tidy.

-Simple menu. 30 or so items, clearly labelled. You'll find what you want quickly.

-Good prices. About twice as much as fast food, but easily four times as good.

-The FOOD. I'm a fan of pad thai, so I fell back on a favorite. I was not disappointed. The 'medium' heat spice is surprisingly spicy, however its one of the few times that the extra heat added to the taste, and not just 'hot' like sauce packets. I'll go mild next time, but I definitely boxed up the remaining for later. Enjoyed every bite. My girlfriend had the yellow curry. I make a curry dish myself, and sadly I think I may end up making it a great deal less now. The curry had a nice heat and flavor to it, and lended well to the fluffy rice and chicken. We both had Thai Iced Tea as well, and it went perfectly with the heat of the food.

-Staff was friendly, refilled water regularly, and checked on us often enough without being overbearing. I overheard them speaking with what was likely a family friend, and at least the handful of things they mentioned were made in house, not purchased or frozen.

Overall, I was super happy, full, and pleased that this place is only a couple blocks up the road."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and it's close to my office.  Called in my order around 5pm on a midweek day and was given 20 minute pickup time.  Told me to pick up at the drive thru...nice...didn't even have to get out of the car!  Food was hot and tasty.  We ordered the Cashew Chicken, Beef Pad Thai and Kung Pao Chicken.  Will def go back.  Good, smiling service too!"}
{"text":"Ok. So I am giving these guys 5 stars. I just ate here, I ordered the cashew nut chicken spicy level 1 of 5. Not very hot so I will move to 2 of 5 next trip. The food was excellent and 5 stars. The service was excellent and 5 stars.  It looks like they got the air conditioner problem fixed. Nice and cool this time. The food is excellent and always fresh. These guys have another location down in Chinatown. Also great. They have good curries. Cashew nut chicken is the best here. 3 stars is not too hot for me"}
{"text":"They have great service the food taste very good the customer service people are very nice good restaurant to eat and they also do delivery incredible love it will sure come back again.
And I do recommend this place to anyone like Thai food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I wanted some Thai food, but we did not want to go to the popular places that everyone know about.  We decided this place because it is across the street from my apt. 

It is a small family place, WITH A DRIVE THROUGH!

Good was delicious, and I highly recommend the combo fried rice.  My buddy ordered the panang.  Service was fast (about 5 mins).  I cannot stress enough about the service...it was fantastic (water always refilled, etc)"}
{"text":"It is not about the menu, it is about the staff. They are attentive and care about your experience. The food is great no matter what you get. What a hidden gem in the middle of Las Vegas. It may not look like you can even eat inside this small place but do it. Go for the lunch special at $6.99 which includes a salad, and your choice of chicken, beef, pork, tofu, vegetable or shrimp (for $2 more) plus fried won ton, and fried egg roll. Just enough to fill you up but not overstuffed. 

Did I mention the staff? Top notch in every way. They really care about your experience. Take a chance here you will thank us for the many great reviews."}
{"text":"We love coming to this place. The owner is always on site and is very gracious and helpful. The food is reasonably priced and the portions are decent sized. We have enjoyed the pad Thai, Mongolian beef, crab rangoons, and many other dishes. My favorite is the mango sticky rice dessert. It is so delicious!"}
{"text":"Update!  Inside is small yet very clean.  Have always believed if a restaurants bathroom is spotless, so is the kitchen.  Thai red curry over brown rice was the star of the show!  Made my night!"}
{"text":"So sad to see they are gone. Hoping they have moved and Cindy the owner will update all of us as to the new location."}
{"text":"awesome resto. good food. authentic thai food and delicious. convenient drive thru. its quick a d fast service. staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai place in all of Las Vegas. Authentic Thai food that's priced just right. The best! My wife and I love the Larb and the Spicy Basil. We keep coming back here for more!"}
{"text":"Stopped by there today for lunch after reading reviews on here. I was excited that they had bbq chicken on their lunch special menu, I seen to pictures. I grt there and they no longer have the bbq chicken on their menu at all. I was disappointed with that but I decided to order the spicy basil beef (spicy 3) it was really good and flavorful. The lunch special shows 6.99 for chicken, pork, and beef items and an extra 3.00 for shrimp.  When I ordered the spicy basil beef  she tells me it's an additional 1.00 for beef, ground beef. I was taken back from that but hey I was there already and hungry. I open the container and the lunch special comes with an vegetable egg roll, won ton, and salad. The won ton was good, the egg roll was soggy in the inside and the salad had no dressing, just lettuce and carrots and I paid the extra 1.00 and there wasn't even a great amount of the beef. (That was a let down) I gave it 3 stars because again the dish was delicious but I did experience difficulties. Still not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall restaurant but I guarantee you it'll be an excellent experience. The food is super good"}
{"text":"Great little place!  Great dishes and they have tofu as a option for all of them. Big thumbs up for me. Staff was very kind."}
{"text":"Super fast, friendly, and you really can't get more  convenient than ordering over the phone &  picking up at the window.  Not to mention,  despite it's tiny demeanour,  Siam Thai has some of the best damn red curry I've ever had.  5 stars all the way, you guys are the best!"}
{"text":"The place is small but the food is good. The Tom yum soup was tasty and so was the beef pad see ew. I was a bit concerned about one of the cooks coughing up a lung in the kitchen though. Don't know if he was wearing a mask or covered his mouth but I sure hope he wasn't coughing in our food. Hence the 3 stars.The lady in the dining area was really nice and friendly even though she was in the middle of a business deal/meeting, she made sure my family and I were properly served and taken care of."}
{"text":"Great food great service definitely worth a try if you like Thai food! Awesome lunch specials as well!"}
{"text":"The place is small, clean and the service is good and so is the food. We had Pad Thai, Yellow curry, and mango rice for dessert. On the heat level, they go from 1-5 with 3 being spicy. I usually order 3 when I get Thai, but here it is just a little too hot. My wife had a 2 and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Love this place! We order a variety of things each time, and while it all has a higher spice level than we get at other Thai restaurants, the flavor is always amazing. We never go higher than a 1, for that reason. The owner is a tough gal, and she'll dish the attitude right back if you come in with one. With that said, we've never had an issue with her; she gives us free desserts while we wait for our takeout and extras for the kids when we dine in. 

Not a 5-star because the pricing is a little steep. Nonetheless, this is a neighborhood spot that we'll continue to support, in hopes that they're able to stick around."}
{"text":"Well, Kevin A. pretty much summed it up in his review: new, clean, friendly and very good food! I meant to snap pics of my spicy (4/5, so good) basil chicken and whatnot, but I was too hungry. Mango sticky rice was addictive! They have a drive-thru and the menu says they deliver. Since I live really close, I walked and did takeout. Everything was cooked fresh and was ready to go within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"The food was incredibly good, we ordered the Pad Thai chicken & Kung Pao chicken.
Be careful on the spicy, it's from 1-5, if you're used to the 1-10 and you pick a 6, here get a 1 or 2. I learned my lesson the first time I was here. The food will not disappoint you, one of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The portion for the lunch special Pai Thai was small, but very tasteful. The pot stickers were very good.  The flavor of the chicken pai Thai was very good and I got the 2 on the heat index. Good thing because it was hot.  The service was good and the place was clean."}
{"text":"I like it very much it was a a quiet and quaint little place I personally had the Thai fried rice with beef spicy and it was very good I enjoy your very much and my partner has spicy basil chicken and I also tried that and I liked it too the host was very nice and took very good care of us from the outside it looks like a little hole in the wall restaurant and it is a very enjoyable place on the inside quiet and peaceful"}
{"text":"Small mom and pop Thai place. Came here for lunch ( they have specials during lunch ). Food was fresh and tasty. Dining room is a bit small. I had the garlic chicken which had a nice kick to it. 

All in all pretty happy with the food , service and price. Will stop by to try additional items on the menu."}
{"text":"I was wondering. Does anyone know where they move? They make the best apple fried rice. :(. So sad they closed. I wonder if they move to another location. ?"}
{"text":"Great experience:) I had the pad see ewe, spice 2, and my friend had curry and pad thai..all delicious! Staff was extremely sweet and helpful. I will most definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I had a stomach ache and was hungry for Tom Yum soup when I found this place on Yelp. The place is small; but, I do not judge the book by its cover. Thus, I stopped by for lunch. I ordered a hot pot of Tom Yum (w/ shrimp). My order came quickly. I also had a bowl of white rice which I later found out from my receipt that it counts a side. Therefore, my bill was higher than expected.
The interior was cozy & bright. The customer service was good. The soup was good, too! I'll definitely come back and try different items next time.

Oh, my stomachache went away when I left the restaurant. I'm not sure if the soup helped, or I was just too hungry."}
{"text":"Neighborhood Thai food to go or dine in.   Basic Thai menu done satisfactorily.  Nothing outstanding but family-style servings of pad Thai, basil, ginger and other dishes served w/choice of meat or tofu.  In a strip mall w/parking aplenty."}
{"text":"Walked into this place today around 12:20 pm grabbed a menu that was on the counter and proceeded to look at it.  There were about 9 people there and 1 car at the drive thru.  As iw as looking a lady server is runnin around all worried.  Like a chicken with her head cut off.  I waited about 10 min and finally took my order.  I ordered the chicken pad Thai level 3 heat.  Finally paid after putting in my order 1230pm i sat down at a table near the door to wait for my food as i ordered togo.  A couple walks in and the lady makes me move out of my chair and sit them at my table as there was a table near the back.  But had dishes all over.  So i moved and sat and waited for my food. The couple that took my table per the server ordered and got their food before i did.  I finally got mybfood at 113pm. I 7min short of 1hr for my food.  I will definitely not be going back as their service is ridiculous.

  Only reason i gave it a 2star was because the padthai had good flavor but level 3 had a good kick to it"}
{"text":"dont you hate when u try something for the first time and its great and you go back and its not that great lol well thats how i am with this place i love authentic thai food love to find new places this is across from my job how convenient i thought some people in my office love it some dont the first time i had it loved it forgot to tell them i dont like peanuts in my pad thai but they were cooked into the noodle where the consistency was great not slimy noodle like QUAY APPROVED. then i went the next time and idk if i just had an old batch but it was not the same. ill stick to going as soon as they open"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Thai restaurants, but this restaurant is the best one I have ever been to. There restaurant is clean and the food are fresh. My favorite dishes are pad Thai and larb salad. People who work in there is really nice and friendly. Give them a try and you will love Thai foods."}
{"text":"This was the best thai food near my house! Loved the food and the service :) just went by today and apparently its turning into a taco shop. I loved their food! If the owner sees this can they tell me their new location if they moved? :) lol"}
{"text":"Don't let this places outward appearance fool you.  It surely is a diamond in the rough. We walk in and it is small,  basic decor, nothing special. We are greeted by a very sweet woman who takes or order.  I got the pad ke mao thai spicy #5 (Thai spice is hotter,  it wasn't just spicy it had great flavor) and the pineapple fried rice for my baby.  Our friends got mint fried rice and pad ke mao as well,  all spicy.  My friends was a little spicy for her taste but our waitress was on it. She was filling or glasses when they needed to be and was on it! Great and friendly service. Our waitress recommend my friend to get a fried egg on top his mint fried rice as well.  When our food came to the table it was nice and hot,  you could tell it was fresh. Not very greasy as some other plaes and it was very authentic.  I finished my whole plate,  it was so delectable i couldn't help myself! Next time ill have to save rim for the sticky rice and mango. 

Ps it has a drive-thru,  odd but convenient ;)"}
{"text":"You wouldn't think to stop here for awesome Thai food, but you definitely should. This small, quaint restaurant serves a mean assortment of very authentic Thai dishes. We had the wonton soup which was delicious (watch out for the spiciness level, they aren't kidding around.) the pork is so flavorful that it infuses the soup perfectly. We also had the pineapple curry with shrimp and I have to say, it, too was well balanced and smooth. The interior can be improved as the place has bare walls that can be adorned in brilliant Thai style tapestries or something along those lines. All in all, great place to enjoy some flavorful Thai cuisine!"}
