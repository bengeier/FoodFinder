{"text":"Never again, which sucks because we just bought a house less than a mile from here and my wife and I love mexican food. We gave it a try today, the beans were runny, the rice had very little flavor to it. Shredded beef in our tacos was burnt. A 2 beef taco combo and a 4 rolled taco combo came out to $15.81, which is way overpriced in my opinion. From a glance at their menu they are overpriced on just about everything. Poliberto's  at 43rd and Glendale and Federico's near 43rd and Peoria both have much better food and at better prices."}
{"text":"Ok I know there are probably upwards a thousand 'bertos restaurants in the Valley, but Hilbertos is one of the best I've been to.   It's really close to where I work so I go there almost every morning as my morning ritual for breakfast. The ham, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito is simple, but amazing all at the same time. It blows McDonald's and Burger King's burritos out of the water! I usually get the green sauce to go with it. The red sauce is good too, but I like green better.   The service there is quick and to the point so you can get in and get out really quick.   The building used to be a Taco Bell so there is plenty of seating. I'm usually on the go so I don't eat there.   Very good restaurant!"}
{"text":"So my old man and I went to Hilberto's  and we order 5 bean & cheese burrito and quesadillas and a taco. So it cost 38.00 dollars, so we paid for the food and we park the car in a spot. So we check the bag and we where missing 2 bean & cheese burrito and a quesadillas. So we went back to the drive thru and said said we where missing some of are food. Then she was acting like we where crazy and said we never said that. So we argue, and she said she want to see the receipt but she never gave us one. So I knew she want us to buy the missing food so I did and cost 25.00 dollar, they where double charging us. So I said never mind I ain't paying for garbage food. Go to Taco Bell across the street way more better food."}
{"text":"I just ate here for lunch today. inside and out was clean including the restroom.  the food: nothing special i ordered a taco and tostada combo plate, it seemed average nothing special but i would eat it again. the beans where good, better than most places. the beef in my taco was moist and slightly greasy (not as greasy as some other places but still some grease) i wish it came with a few more veggies like tommatoes or offered some freash salsa at the salsa bar but it was only standard red and green sauce.  I also ordered some horchata (SP?) little pricey for it but i wanted it badly, again nothing special you can actually see the little bag that pumps the premade mix into the machine. for soda, I always order the smallest size if i'm dinning in free refills so why pay extra for a bigger cup.   I was disapointed that people decided to tag in the bathroom, some folks decided to tag on the table they where sitting at while i was in there... some people have no respect. the casher was nice and I chatted with her a minute about the tagging.   It is really close to GCC and since i work and go to school there it is an obvious choice. I believe there was an aditional charge for using my debit card but i'm not sure. I will try other menu items and leave reviews when i am able."}
{"text":"I've gone here off and on for a few years, and I've really liked the food.  I go out of my way to get here over other Mexicans places near me."}
{"text":"Really disappointed on how the food came out to be. Had my hopes to high   Came here on the day Mexico Vs. Uruguay game was happening. I went to attend the stadium after, but the food was just sad to be honest. I assumed that with the hype of the game they would give it their best to gain more attention from Latinos.   I ordered two al pastor tacos and one of asada. The meat for the pastor was literally burnt just like their sign out front. The asada wasn't even finished cooking cause it was so chewy and bloody. I can't believe that they would allow that food to the customers. I was in a hurry for the game so I didn't make a big deal and left the food there.  Was expecting more from a place like that, either that or they were from Uruguay and didn't like us since we had Mexico jerseys. Either way no excuse to give us such poor food.   I don't like giving one star to restaurant but this place deserved it.  I hope they change the cook or who ever was in charge that day, cause they will loose customers and eventually their business."}
{"text":"Great tacos.  Being asked at the drive thru menu if I'll be paying cash or debit sounds like someone is running a little scam (against the establishment, not the customer).  I admire the American entrepreneurial spirit."}
{"text":"Great Food!! I have been stopping by this place for years. Steak Ranchero platter is one of my favs! Got a chance to talk with the owners daughter the other night.  Very kind and sweet lady, let her know that the food has always been great and the service from the people that work there is amazing!   KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! KCCO! !"}
{"text":"*YUMMY* is all I have to say about this place.  It's your typical cheap Mexican food place that are a dime-a-dozen in Phoenix.  This has always been one of my favorites though.  The carne asada burrito is huge and well worth the $5.25 you'll pay for it.  The place doesn't look so great from the outside and the drive-thru is a little strange, but it's delicious.  It's also never made me sick, so no worries in that department.  Go, eat, and enjoy the place."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss.  That goes for the whole experience from service to food to price.    I feel like the folks here can be on the rude side, but no matter how rude, the do get the order right.  I've ordered cheese enchilada's here before that the cheese wasn't even melted.  I can make that for $.50 cents.. and put it in the microwave and get a better outcome.  And.. to top it off, a couple taco's and some horchata will run you almost 10 bucks.. Ouch.  On the positive side, the horchata is yummy and you can't really go wrong with steak taco's on soft corn tortilla's.  Order this and you are safe."}
{"text":"I remember this place having good menudo years ago, and I returned today and it did not disappoint! I cant speak about anything else on the menu, but the menudo was tasty!  Will return again to satisfy future menudo cravings."}
{"text":"Like a beacon in the still dark early dawn that held promise of filling an empty stomach.  What I had planned on having for breakfast had turned into something ugly and rather than grab something else I decided to head out and see what I found.  I don't now what their hours are but it seems like any time I am around they are open. The building was originally a Taco Bell, of which a shiny new one is across the street.  I chose to take my food with me this time, not sure a white guy is welcome in that neighborhood before the sun is up.    The place is worn but clean.  I got a potato, bacon, egg burrito that I almost was able to finish for $3.75.  It was OK but not really tasty, like it could have used something but I wasn't about to test their salsa.  By being 2.6, mostly because of the lack of much flavor, it barely made the three scale"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Owner is sitting down eating next to the reister, I walk in, he says nothing just looks at me waiting for my order. After I pay, no thank you or anything else, it's almost as if it's more convenient for his business to be there and it's my privilege to pay him as well. They have better Service at QT. watch out for the surcharge on card trxs, it's hidden and he doesn't say. Lastly, no receipt either. It your risk if you go to this place..."}
{"text":"We use to come here before and no matter what time the food has always been good.. service ehh ok today we ordered a burrito and an horchata forget that the horchata was so horrid like so disgusting but his service he was just so upset at being there. I don't know if he was upset because we ordered and we paid with card after we said we were going to pay cash but we had to drive back and return the horchata it was that disgusting and he was so upset we returned the horchata.  Not only that he took out the pitcher that had the horchata and in an unsanitary way tasted the horchata to discredit us returning our horchata... he have us a refund for the horchata but was so uncaring and rudely refunded our money. Will avoid this place from now on. So disappointed. Wouldn't even give it one star."}
{"text":"Well I have to say RUN AWAY. Ordered food from Postmates, order totaled 10.10 without tax.  Arrived they charged Postmates 19.35.  (this was not including all the fees from postmates just the food) do you see a bit of a difference there.   Well perhaps, it was an oversight, perhaps they aren't current on the website.  So I called.  YEAH they know the prices are wrong or they just leave it that way to get the orders, but funny thing is they still fulfill the order , screw over the customers, and then when you try to call the number doesn't work.  hmmmmm  then when you finally do find the right number, and call, oh sorry we know it is wrong, but tough , nothing we can do.  RUN AWAY.  they are shysters as much as postmates.  Hope the owner gets his own Karmic payback.  DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM.  FYI, read all the current reviews.  Hmmmm there seems to be a trend here....."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill, and that's saying a lot since they started so low to begin with. I've been going to this place since they opened and have been  disappointed over the last couple of months. Would it hurt to hire a cashier who understands customer service and tell the cooks in the back to put down their burrito to make the customer's? Go to Taco Bell across the street. Half the price for the same diarrhea.   The picture I've uploaded is for my order of 1 chicken quesadilla with cheese plain. 2 orders for 5 rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole, and a beef burrito with cheese, sour cream and lettuce.   Again, would probably have been half the price across the street with friendly customer service."}
{"text":"The windows and doors are boarded up. Apparently, it is closed!  There is no way to get any food. So, I would skip this one."}
{"text":"I've been going and eating here over a year.  Sometimes three times a week.  The style of Mexican food counts a lot when you are buying Mexican food.  There are so many styles, some of the more expensive places are more American style Mexican food, but this location has the style that is true to Mexican food.  Roll tacos, is a meal on its own, the Burritos are more than you expect.  They know me by name, always friendly.   I have read some of the comments that were unhappy, but I have never been unhappy.  The people that work there have been very welcoming to me and I appreciate how good their food has been and will be in the future."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco shop.  It has all the same menu items you'd expect at the prices you'd expect.  There are a million taco stands in the Phoenix area, but this one stands out to me.   Why you ask? #1 -  Their carne asada is the best I've ever had.  I'm a Phoenix native, therefore I've had A LOT of carne asada from taco stands in my life.  Hands down... the best! #2 - I've never gotten sick from this place.  I can list off numerous taco shops where I have. #3 - Kinda goes along with #2, the ingredients all seem to be fresh.  If you get sour cream, it's not curdly.  The bacon in the breakfast burritos are crispy, not chewy.  The tortillas taste like they make them there. #4 - You can call ahead and order to pick up. #5 - They have pollo asada dishes. Their food reminds me of meals I've had in Rocky Point.  Very delicious and affordable."}
{"text":"I ate here twice. The 1st time my super nachos were very plain flavor. My carne asada meat in my burrito was nothing but fat no actual meat gross gross..  So I gave it some time I decided to give breakfast a shot.  Chorizo burrito added bacon and potatoes. Agian!! no bacon I paid for not enough chorizo in the egg and potatoes seemed deepfried. There low prices for sure. But there tight with napkins and extra salsa chile. Dude gives me 2 cheaply thin napkins. Ask for more naps he gives me exactly 1 more.  They act like cheap asses. GO TO FEDRICOS OR FILIBERTOS. THEY TRY TOO MAKE THERE FOOD LIKE THEM ANYWAYS!"}
{"text":"This place adds .50 for a debit card.   Has a styrofoam cup hanging from a string in the window that says tips.  The food is overpriced.  I went here quite a few times over the years. Got raw eggs a few times in the Chorizo and undercooked beans quite a few times.  Sour cream is a pile of mush. Guacamole is cut so bad it's like mayo with green food coloring.  Tacos are really really greasy even for a joint like this. Carne Asada Burrito is mediocre. Avoid."}
{"text":"This lil drive thru place has some of the best Mexican food on the west side. Its clean. Its fresh. Its cheap. Its delicious. Trust me you want to eat here."}
