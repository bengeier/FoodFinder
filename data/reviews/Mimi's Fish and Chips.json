{"text":"I never knew I liked fish and chips until I tried Mimi's.

Every few weeks I eat their haddock, fries, and coleslaw. And every time it tastes amazing. The fish is battered perfectly, just enough to add to the flavour, but not so much that it overpowers the flavour of the fish."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, service is a bit slow though, and there isn't a very large eating space, so this is more of a to-go type place. But overall, I would recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Way over priced. 70 dollars to feed my family.. Halibut was over cooked, and fries were so so at best- not even salted.
No packets of ketchup, no salt.. No lemons (at a fish n chips place????????) And just packets of tartar sauce.

Truthfully, the fish the Mandarin serves off the buffet is better.."}
{"text":"After a long time, FINALLY! fish & chips that are actually more fish than batter and less oily. Stumbled upon this place by accident and what a good accident it was. A small place with few tables. Certainly not a place to take your date. But, if it is good fish and chips you want, try it and you won't regret it. Try the haddock while you are at it."}
{"text":"explored this place right on main street near downtown brampton. small dingy place .....ordered fish n chips , it was average but crispy !
At the time of the payment had a glimpse of the kitchen , fryer n prep area . looked unhygienic , frier oil was looking black ... n prep area was not upto my expectation.
may not visit again ! HEALTH FIRST ."}
{"text":"Probably my vote for favourite fish and chips in Brampton.  This and Henry's. 

Been going here ever since Mimi really did own it (it's other family members running it now on my last visits) , but the fish is as good as ever.

Fantastic beer battered halibut that is ALWAYS crispy.  The key here is how consistently they deliver well battered, crispy fish

Cole slaw is excellent as well

Took a star away for the use of frozen calamari"}
{"text":"Ordered $8.49 lunch special via skip the dishes which was tasty. The lunch special consisted of haddock, fries and Pop. Would def go/order again."}
