{"text":"Best BBQ that I've had in long time. The meat fell from the ribs, chicken was moist and also fell from the bone.
I had the spicy sauce it was just right.
Beans have bacon & pieces of sausage in it & was spicy. Way above average. 
Coleslaw & macaroni salad were pretty good, I will say slightly above average.  
You need to go to their website to find them  cause the truck moves around Buckeye."}
{"text":"We recently discovered this new BBQ food truck in Buckeye...and it's pretty darn good!

They are located on Jackrabbit near Circle K south of the 10 Tuesday through Friday, and at the Tractor Supply on Miller on Saturday.  Closed on Sunday & Monday.

Since finding the place, we have eaten there twice.  Both meals were consistently good.  This is what we have tried thus far:

Chopped Brisket Sandwich - Religious experience level good!  Tender, juicy brisket piled high on a delicious toasted roll with just a hint of their tangy sauce.

Chopped Pork Sandwich - Good, but not up to the brisket's quality.  In fairness, I prefer my BBQ pork pulled rather than chopped.

Hot Link Hoagie - Spicy smoked sausage sliced into thin disks and piled into a long roll with sauce. The sausage was actually quite tasty, but maybe too much sauce on my sandwich and the hoagie roll is not as good as the regular sandwich rolls.

St. Louis Ribs - These are awesome, served with or without sauce by your choice.  They are smoked perfectly, are very meaty, and feature a nice black pepper rub.

Smoked Chicken - Good, but the white meat was a tiny bit on the dry side.  It is complimented nicely by their sauce, I must say.

Beans - My wife loved these.  Tender pinto style beans with chili-style seasoning.  Was that a bit of cumin in there?  Yum!

Overall we are extremely excited to have some great BBQ locally here in Buckeye.  I recommend that any fan of smoked meats give this truck a try!"}
{"text":"We just stopped by tonight and picked up two slabs of ribs for dinner!  We hardly made it out of the parking space when we had to open the box and have just one before we got home!!!  So delicious!  Sweet but spicy so good!  We live in California but will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Second time eating here and this place is amazing!! Food is good every time I look forward to eating here every Sunday. It's hard to find good bbq that each of my family members like and we found it here. I just want to say THANK YOU to the HARRIS FAMILY!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!  I am not a big fan of smoked and BBQ meats. Harris is the exception and it's all good, the pork, brisket and chicken. Even my very picky kids loved it. They ate a full rack of ribs and half a chicken by themselves. They are in buckeye every Saturday."}
{"text":"We heard about this place on Yelp and decided to call them as we were about to pass by Buckeye en route to Phoenix. We found out it was a food truck run by a husband- and wife-team. The woman who answered told us their location for the day: in front of the Tractor Supply Store. We exited the interstate and found it with relative ease. We ordered a BBQ beef sandwich with fries.

The sevice was fast and incredibly friendly.

The whole meal was delicious. The BBQ beef was especially flavorful. We ate our lunch at a picnic table under a set of canopies provided by the food truck. They also offer ice cream scoops, though we didn't order any this time.

If you're looking for top-notch, no-frills lunch, this is the place!"}
{"text":"What a great discovery in Buckeye! Each meat we've tried has had its own smokey and unique flavor- no mass produced , bottle sauce BBQ here! This food truck could easily compete with any sit down restaurant in town and come out on top!

Being right off I-10 on Jackrabbit Trail makes them a very convenient lunch or dinner grab spot. Well worth checking out for yourself!"}
{"text":"The customer service is not professional, there is no smoke smell when you walk up to order, the bbq sauce was just HORRIBLE! I was truly excited about stopping and eating here. I thought what a fantastic idea and would never hate on any small upcoming business. But this food is not real BBQ, and to read through the other reviews made me realize many people from around here must not get out much! They represent themselves as the best bbq in town, I would hate to come across the worse because this is what I felt I got. Memphis BBQ in old Buckeye was not that great but this was all time the worse BBQ I have ever ate. I never thought anyone could mess up BBQ. I recommend the drive to Phoenix to Bobby Q's. Now that's BBQ!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! They have the best chopped pork I have ever had and it is so flavorful. My husband loves the hot links. Just tried the Hot Mess Fries yesterday and am in love. Everything that I have tried is amazing. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"I don't want to reiterate other people's praise. As a former resident of Florida and Georgia who ate BBQ weekly I can say this is the real deal. The fact that I can get pork on a bun with coleslaw on top only speaks to authenticity.  We lost our prior authentic BBQ spot in Buckeye (a shame) so Harris is a wish come true. If you want the real deal, drive to Buckeye. You will not find better BBQ in Maricopa County."}
{"text":"Being from Kansas City and loving BBQ, Harris Smokehouse BBQ would fit right in. My wife and have been in Phoenix for about 17 years, and in all those years BBQ has been at best average. Harris's just set the bar for the best BBQ in Phoenix. I love the smoke flavor which deep and rich. But if you are a sauce person their homemade sauce is is great, if you like it hot it will grab your taste buds just right but not over power what you are eating. The chicken, ribs, brisket and  sides are a total must have for anyone who craves home style sides that are made with love and attention. The BBQ that you come backfor! I will not eat any other BBQ from now on. .............It might be a drive to Buckeye, but its worth the drive........"}
{"text":"Holy BBQ!  My husband, son, and I stopped here for a quick Sunday lunch and everything we had was amazing!  We tried the bbq chicken, beans, macaroni salad, hot bbq sauce, and slaw hotdog.  Everything was delicious and the hotdog was probably the best hotdog I've ever had.  The owners were so friendly and helpful.  I will be back many more times."}
{"text":"My family and I have been dying to try this BBQ truck. We would drive by it every weekend. Today we finally did!! We ordered 2 pulled pork hoagies with Mac salad and the smokehouse loaded fries. I just want to say I have eaten a lot of BBQ and this was probably close to the best I have had. The meat and sauce were full of flavor. We will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Once again they knocked it out of the park! Love it when they are parked on Miller at tractor supply! Great food. I have had it work before for party's too! Everyone I talk to is a huge fan. A must try."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ. . have been there several times while they are at TSC on Miller Rd and each time the food has been very good. Have had the chopped beef brisket, the chopped pork and today I had the Slaw Link again (spicy link w/spicy BBQ sauce) and some mac salad. Really good. Next time I'm going to try the chicken. The owners are very friendly and service is very fast. Happy to support this local business and their food makes my weekends better :)"}
{"text":"Best bbq hands down I will be returning for more. I'm not a fan of bbq but this shit was good. I would recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great service and great food. Being from Texas it's hard to find good bbq in Arizona, but this place has good bbq and delicious sides."}
{"text":"The hit dog and fries were rlly good 
There hot not cold
Cold drinks
It rlly isn't bad food so I would give it a 4 stars"}
{"text":"Probably the best spare ribs I've ever had. Very friendly staff, restaurant quality food, I just wish there were on of these in California!"}
