{"text":"This place opened relatively recently, I think.  I've tried it twice for quick lunches.

The first time I ordered a Bento box and the food was just fine, with a good variety of items in the box and relatively quick speed for the dish to arrive.  The second time was not quite so good.  I ordered from the Chinese menu, a garlic chicken, and it was really, really small.  The flavour was okay, but you can get far bigger portions in Chinatown for the same price.

As with many Asian places, this place suffers from, well, presumptuousness.  I was not pleased the second time I walked in when they automatically put the all-you-can-eat sushi menu in my hand.  How about bothering to ask, huh?  The waitresses spoke such poor English that I felt like I was butting my head against the wall when asking for *anything* (and I happen to speak some Mandarin).  This is another one of those Asian places where the servers allow their language barrier to come across as rudeness.  You really have to have a high tolerance for curt responses, stony expressions and awkward communication at this place, because TCJ really does not create a great atmosphere for your dining experience.  The owners and managers need to work on getting their serving staff to look as if they actually want the customers there.  They failed my usual \"water refill test\" -- took me about five minutes to nail down a waitress to get something so basic -- and when they did finally notice me, their response was cold and impatient.

=================
(Update:  September 2014)

Original two-star rating raised to three stars.

I went back a third time to TCJ during lunchtime and had a good experience.  While service is still hit-or-miss -- although I was the only customer there for about 25 minutes, the waitresses talked with one another too much and weren't very attentive -- I had a General Tsao's chicken that was substantially bigger in portion than the last Chinese meal I tried to have here.  The order also came with decent vegetables and fried rice that actually tasted like real fried rice.  The experience is good enough for me to raise my assessment to at least an average, decent place worth going to."}
{"text":"They have very reasonable price and excellent services. For a place downtown that would give us 10% discount and they don't charge tax, we would go back here. You know the thing about AYCE? You get confused with your orders because you don't remember what you asked for. And the servers here would tell you what they are giving you so you know if you ordered that or not. Usually they don't do that and just place the food down to the table and walk away. I like this place because the servers are very nice and polite and they speak English. I would definitely recommend it to all my friends."}
{"text":"Very accommodating to allergies, great customer service! My cousins and I love the cheap lunch special and will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this for anyone looking for quick, easy asian cuisine. The variety is incredible and the quality is amazing considering how diverse the menu is and how low the prices are. I have eaten take-out from there twice and expect many more orders to come."}
{"text":"Ordered online for delivery. got a confirmation e-mail with order number. An hour and a half later and I'm still waiting for the order. Tried calling the restaurant but no one answers and there is no voice mail. Terrible service... actually no service."}
{"text":"I live close to the restaurant and I am big fan of sushi. 
I been to this restaurant many times (once/twice of week). 
food are tasty. I only eat sushi maki or sashimi so I don't know about other Thai food or Chinese food they offer here. 

The reason why I am writing review for first time in my life!!!!, because of the service. 
They have 15% off on dinner all you can eat if we pay by cash. 
I thought I prepared enough cash. But I was short to pay 20% tips and I asked server If i could give out tips in card and I explained that I was little short. The server brought card machine and told me \"Next time you should prepare enough cash for tips. I am only going to let you pay tips with card today but next time you have to pay tips with  cash\" with attitude.  
I didn't complained if they give me wrong order or late services. But the way she talk to me was very rude. I will not recommend to people who is looking for good service with friendly server. 


 They lost $370 revenue per month.  Because I  will never go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Spontaneously wanted sushi and went here with my boyfriend.  There was only one other table that was filled there.  For a small place, the food quality was surprisingly really good!  Lots to choose from for the AYCE dinner.  Affordable and good eats for sure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to this restaurant several times since it has opened maybe about 3 or 4 weeks ago. We have been for both lunch (13.00) and dinner (22.00) and the great part about the pricing is that it is all you can eat and ayce places charge extra for the weekend and this restaurant doesn't. My boyfriend loves quite a lot of the chinese dishes his favourite being chicken with broccoli. I mainly go to enjoy the sushi, I enjoy the salmon sushi and the toronto roll. We both really like the cheesy wontons they have a bit of a sweetness to it but whenever we go or are thinking about going that is what we think about. So far when we go in it isn't busy so that is a bonus for the customers, although we think if it isn't too busy they may close so we think everyone should check this place out. They also have great customer service always asking to refill our drinks or taking away empty plates. We love it!"}
{"text":"I have ordered take-out from here several times since I moved to the area about six months ago, and I have never been disappointed in a dish. For a restaurant that promoted itself as serving Thai, Chinese, and Japanese cuisine, I was surprised by how well all three cuisines were prepared! 

The Thai food bursts with basil, coconut, lime, lemongrass, as well as chili and peanut dishes *allergy alert*. The coconut peanut vegetables and tofu was incredibly delicious, though even my sensitive taste buds did not find it spicy at all (thankfully - I can't handle spicy food very well), as is advertised on the menu.   

The Chinese selection does not disappoint, and you can expect everything from your General Tso to your lemon chicken to Cantonese chow mein to be executed with care, all of which I recommend. The crispy ginger beef is delightfully crispy and flavourful, and a standout dish in my view.  

As for the sushi, it's never tasted old and it is always prepared attentively rather than sloppily. I am often impressed by the visual appeal of the sushi even as it sits in its takeout tray. I find the price to be better than most other sushi restaurants in the area, and the selection is great. 

They've never mixed up an order, my order is always ready lightning fast, the staff is polite and friendly, and I can get Thai, Chinese, and Japanese food all from one place and it's all quite satisfying! What's not to love?!"}
{"text":"We ordered from here weekly, mainly because they are pretty consistent, the broad menu, the awesome price point based on combos, that's why I give them 4 stars. They do better then a 3 star.

Things from the menu we really enjoyed;
Crispy Ginger beef
Cantonese chow Mein
Chicken balls
Fried rice
General Tao 
Bento box
Wonton soup

Awesome for delivery! Great to order from if you want basic Chinese food, they do the job!"}
{"text":"They tend to increase prices on public holidays. Lunch buffet cost  $23 on January 1st. I really do enjoy their food but the price was unreasonable."}
{"text":"Beware of TCJ RESTAURANT!
The staff (if you would call them staff)
Are very rude and they treat you very nasty.
I would suggest that you should choose another establishment were they appreciate your business.
Govern your self approitaly!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how the all you can eat thing works. Other people had tablets from which they were ordering. When I told the server I didn't feel like meat today she handed me the a la carte menu.
I had 2 tofu dishes that had the same ingredients just different sauces. Both were good nonetheless.
Service was typical of a restaurant like this. Efficient but not particularly personal."}
{"text":"Service ok ,the food not even close !!!
But it is affordable at 22.50 I don't think it's worth it"}
{"text":"This was a very strange experience. The outside look of the restaurant is very sketchy but the decor isn't too bad. The two stars are mostly for the food and service - the sushi is really mushy, almost all of the food came to us cold and it took thirty minutes for each round of ordering. Their tea is also this cloudy mix of water and god knows what. All in all, will not be revisiting."}
{"text":"Love TCJ! They have quick and friendly service. The food is always fresh and flavourful, and the rolls are very large."}
{"text":"Great service and equally as great sushi.
Will definitely be returning.
Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Went in for AYCE lunch. The price has gone up since last year (I'm assuming due to the minimum wage increase) to $15.95. It's definitely on the pricier end for AYCE at lunch, but for the quality of the food, it's worth it. You also get 10% off if you pay in cash. 

When you're seated, you can get either water or tea at no charge. If you order tea, they not only bring you a cup of it, but also a small kettle of it so that you can refill it yourself which I thought was cute and neat. I was eating by myself though, so I'm not sure if they give out the refill kettles for groups, but it was a nice gesture nonetheless.

The selection isn't too great as far as appetizers go (this is only in terms of Japanese restaurant staples like karaage, or beef short ribs, etc.). However, what I really like about their ordering system is that all the appetizers, that can be quantified, are ordered by piece so you can have just one piece of sweet potato tempura without worrying about getting 6 in a basket. Despite not having said staples on their menu, they do offer a wide variety of different Thai and Chinese dishes as per the name of the restaurant (like curry, or Kung pao chicken, etc.).

Their sushi selection isn't too bad. Though there aren't too many rolls (or at least they didn't seem to stick out to me since I can't recall seeing even one dragon roll on the menu), there are many basic rolls to choose from. They even offer the tuna maki roll for lunch which isn't available at most places. I also normally dislike tuna but the tuna maki roll here was pretty tasty. The quality of their sushi is above average. Pretty fresh, no fishy taste, and the rice is well seasoned. In terms of the rice to fish ratio, it's actually not too bad (unless you order the pizza; the rice patty is about 3/4 in. thick - delicious though!)

All the food is cooked rather well. Meat is tender and juicy, and seasoned well, fish is fresh, and the tempura is cooked to the perfect crisp although it may be a bit heavy on the batter. They have a tablet ordering system as well, so ordering is a breeze. Also, for once, none of the items that I ordered had magically disappeared or been forgotten. Everything I ordered came and unlike most places, they space out the dishes a little (which I prefer, since I don't like having 10 dishes just sitting on the table).

Service is simple. I feel like you can't really expect incredibly amazing and personable service when you're paying less than $30 for a meal. While I was there, a man was trying to get a recommendation, and from what I could hear, his answer wasn't really questioned though he didn't seem to mind and ended up choosing on his own. They'll bring you food in a timely manner, and take away dishes at decent intervals as well. Personally, I find it completely acceptable. Long story short, if you want to make friends with your waiter/waitress, this place isn't for you.

All in all, it was a good experience, and I would definitely come again. If you're in the area, I'd recommend you give it a try. I just don't think I would've gone out of my way to come here if I wasn't in the neighbourhood. Still, I'm glad I tried it out."}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap Asian eats, you've found your spot! However, beware that any restaurant serving Thai Chinese & Japanese (three very different cuisines) isn't really going to be the best/most authentic at any of them! I went here for lunch and got a Thai green curry. Definitely not the best Thai food I've tasted, but it's cheap enough that I'd consider coming back if I'm in the area and starving. My friends said the same about the Chinese dishes they ordered. In a city boasting a variety of authentic Asian restaurants, not sure why anyone would pick this place except cost."}
{"text":"Had takeout from here. Got a selection of Thai and Chinese dishes. The pad Thai was marginal but some of the Chinese dishes were okay."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have great selection, good prices, friendly attentive staff. Such a gem and its clean. My fav AYCE place downtown. They are open late as well!"}
{"text":"Good place to go if you have a group which can't decide what type of Asian food to eat. Service was good. Food was typical of an AYCE small plates good for a tasting. Sushi was tasty however some of the rolls were too large."}
{"text":"Where do I start?! Not buffet style all you can eat!! Even better.. Order what you can eat; 1 of this, 2 of that, etc. everything comes to you fresh and hot!!! Delicious for most things. Chinese, Japanese and Thai foods.

I was not a fan of the chicken fried rice, something didn't taste right. A little sad that plain steamed rice was not an option. I loved the chicken wings. General Tao chicken wasn't exactly like what I'm used to. Pad Thai, green Curry chicken, shrimp tempura, cheese Won Ton, and tons more were fantastic! 

The restaurant is super clean as well. The staff are really nice and friendly! 

$22.95 for dinner. $13.95 for lunch. (Senior & kid prices). 2 hour time limit. Small fee for unfinished food. 

I definitely will be back! My friend and her son really enjoyed as well!"}
{"text":"The three and a half star a average Yelp Review paired with the \"contrast effect\" of having just walked out of the Moss Park area on a Friday night prompted me to check this place out against my better judgement. 

The restaurant serves Chinese, Japanese, and Thai cuisine, and I suspect that it does all of them an injustice.

Despite the fact that there were only about 3 tables in the restaurant, there seemed to be some confusion about who was serving my dinner companion and I. At one point the server even came to the table and asked if we were ready to order. When we said yes, she looked confused and scurried away. We eventually had to flag someone down (which I hate doing, but the wait was getting ridiculous) who seemed equally clueless. We ordered and were promptly brought water that had a strong garlic taste to it which we both found to be extremely weird. My dinner date even commented that it would be pretty hard to earn that three and a half star Yelp review after that point. 

The food arrived very shortly thereafter, and much to our dismay, we realized that this place wasn't the hidden gem we had hoped for. Everything in my bento box was way overcooked and flavorless. The teriyaki chicken was possibly the driest chicken I have ever tasted. The spicy salmon roll was half decent but not good enough to make me ever want to set foot in this place again. 

If cheap is what you're after, then this may be the place for you. However, if you're on a budget, I'd sooner recommend stepping into a local McDonald's before trying this place out."}
{"text":"I gotta admit that I was skeptical at first to order sushi from here because their menu served food from such a wide range of Asian cuisines (Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Dimsum) that I didn't think they would be particularly \"good\" at any specific cuisine.

Alas, I liked the sound of one of their combos so I ordered takeout from them anyway, praying that I wouldn't be getting listeria that night. Thankfully, everything turned out alright. The rolls were just ok - can't say much about them. They were a decent size, with a decent amount of filling, and the presentation was alright. Nothing special, but nothing to criticize. The highlight though, was the sashimi! They gave me large thick cuts of salmon, and I was delighted to find that it was fresh. I would consider coming back again for their in-store all you can eat dinner."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place. I had a sushi craving, and thought I'd give it a shot. Good amount of food for the price paid. Decent quality, and none of my avocado was remotely brown (I'm picky about my avocado!). I'd likely order from here again."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! I order from here a few times a month and they are quick to deliver. They're also super friendly and make sure your order is correct each time. The food never fails to satisfy. It's my favorite take out place."}
{"text":"Their bento box is the bomb! If you are craving Japanese food and you want a full packed meal that will satisfy your appetite get the bento box. You gotta eat hear if you want more of asian flavours."}
{"text":"The food is good if you get there at lunch before 3pm then you get it for $15c or about $11 us it is all you can eat . they give you a check list of all you can eat, on the menu, you check it off and they bring it to you.If you are still hungry they give you another ,then another. The noodle dish with veggies and chicken was good, the spring roll, fried rice . If you overload the menu then it becomes confusing , try just five items at a time. It's great for lunch but I would pass for dinner"}
{"text":"T.C.J did a good job cleaning up a store front that was once a dirty pond shop. The exterior and interior is nice - minus the terrible sign/logo. 

The service was courteous  and quick.

There is a good selection of Chinese, Thai, and Japanese. The dishes were a bit bland though. 

Undecided if I'd return."}
{"text":"Cardápio com muitas opções no AYCE (All You Can Eat). Comparando com outros restaurantes AYCE, o preço é excelente e o sabor da comida chega a ser melhor que os demais do Downtown, porém alguns pratos deixaram a desejar. O ambiente não é o melhor de todos, mas o atendimento foi bom. Eles têm opções de comida Tailandesa, Chinesa e Japonesa, tanto à la carte quanto no AYCE. Por isso que se chama TCJ. Se está em dúvida, vá e conheça. Não vai se arrepender."}
{"text":"food took forever to come. For a AYCE place you can be waiting forever for you sushi to come. They always bring out the chinese and thai food first than sushi later. It like they are too cheap to give you more sashimi. Every time I order 10 or 20 pieces of sashimi they never give me the right amount of sashimi I want and if I order again it will take forever to come and making you want to cancel it and pay the bill. IF YOU ARE TOO CHEAP TO GIVE OUT SASHIMI SHOULDN'T EVEN BE ON THE MENU THAN ...."}
{"text":"TCJ gives you lots of variety for a low price. I went for lunch and they have lots of non-sushi options as well as all the essential sushi and rolls. The food can be hit or miss depending on the dish but overall fairly average when it comes to taste. It can take awhile for some dishes to come out and sometimes we would receive one order of a dish when we ordered two, with the second order coming fifteen minutes later. All the orders are placed on i Pads so not sure why they struggle to bring it all at once. The building seemed to be under construction when I went."}
{"text":"$12.99 for AYCE Thai, Chinese AND Japanese food? I don't know how you can go wrong with that. The menu is extensive and filled with so much variety (ie haw gow dumplings, deep fried cheese wontons, shanghai noodles, dynamite sushi rolls, thai curries, etc) and the service is fast and efficient. After reading some of the reviews, I opted out of getting Thai food and mostly got sushi and Chinese. The sushi was surprising good and not overwhelmed with rice. I was also a huge fan of the Chinese food. The haw gow shrimp dumplings were absolutely fresh and hot whereas the shanghai noodles were plentiful and flavourful. One of my complaints is that the service was dreadful. The one server seemed to be in a bad mood and said maybe two words to us. In addition to that, every time the servers brought items to us they had to ask us every time \"did you order this?\". It was a little annoying. I will still come back though for the food!"}
{"text":"I was deceived by the ugly dining looking exterior and assumed that the food here would be bad. However, after dining at TCJ more than a few times I'd say I was wrong to make that assumption.

The menu may overwhelm you at first since it is quite extensive and you have many options. But the dishes I've had have been consistently quite tasty and worth the price. 

Personally I cannot stop getting LJ2 bento box if you go for lunch. It is delicious and a huge portions for only $6.99! The spicy salmon roll here is a winner and one of my favourites. 

Service isn't the greatest and sometimes you'll have a young boy bringing you the food but I don't think it ruins the dining experience."}
{"text":"Been to this place several times for lunch.

It's unique in that it's got Thai, Chinese, and Japanese all you can eat.

Of the offerings the Thai curries are the weakest, pad Thai is alright...but nothing compared to other Thai places I've been. Chinese is pretty good, especially the general cho chicken and the spring rolls. Japanese is alright, the rolls are decent and the yam tempura is delicious. 

For dessert I recommend the deep fried banana's, never had them broke delicious!

Also service is really fast.

For 13.95 all you can eat lunch including bottomless pop, I can't complain and ill keep on visiting."}
{"text":"TCJ Restaurant struck me as sort of being one of the OK, rather ho-hum nothing particular subpar but with nothing particularly good or excellent either. In other words, mediocre. 

On the good side, the décor is rather nice, but if they meant it to be trendy in any way, they missed the mark on that. The menu is wide ranging and one of their rather nice touches are selections of various combo offerings for lunch. I tried their \"Combo for One C\" with tuna sushi, two pieces, salmon sushi, four pieces, and dragon roll served as a cut of 5 slices. Though good, nothing exemplary that would make me longing to return. 

The service was nice, the prices are reasonable, so though I have nothing to complain about, nothing in particular to rave about either."}
{"text":"Pretty decent AYCE East of Yonge. Nice, newly renovated interior with no residual sketchiness from the surrounding area. 

The menu is extensive with Japanese,  Chinese and Thai. The sushi is fresh and decent. Not too much rice,  rolls are good size. 

Chinese menu isn't bad either although I have a feeling all their chicken dishes are all battered and fried but with different sauces. 

Pro-tip: order all your non sushi dishes as soon as possible,  like first round. If not,  they will serve you all sushi first then bring out huge amounts of fried rice,  noodles,  etc when you're stuffed and make you pay for food you can't finish."}
{"text":"Great AYCE in the area! I have walked past it numerous times but never actually ate there before this week. 

We had AYCE lunch. The menu has a wide range of options. The sushi and rolls (Japanese) were fresh, delicious and came out very fast. 

The Thai food was bursting with flavors. 

The Chinese food was decent but nothing I would rave about. It is the reason I gave 4 stars and not 5. It is very bland and tasteless, especially compare to the other delicious food they serve there. The fried rice was lacking taste and the Chinese shrimp was not impressive. It consisted in tiny shrimps (about 4) in a ton of vegetables. The Dim Sum on the other hand has a perfect balance of flavor. 

The restaurant itself is squeaky clean and nicely decorated. Service is friendly and fast. 

I would recommend and will be back there for sure."}
{"text":"Went for ayce dinner... Honestly wasn't overly impressed the sushi was bland and falling apart

I'll admit there Chinese menu was good and tasted great

There dim sum was nasty but what do u expect from a multi Asian Resturant

Hot and sour soup was awesome, mango salad was good and so was tempura

I'd go again just not for dinner... It's average honestly but it's around the corner from work so it works for me no other Asian options that close"}
{"text":"TOTALLY LEGIT SPOT

TCJ : Thai Chinese Japanese AYCE 

Interesting concept .. really straight to the point. Very surprised .. They had sashimi .. very good quality salmon. They have a very solid menu , a great selection of items. I liked that they gave you the premium vegetables along with all the proteins , flavours were clean & delicious. Portion size was great .. You could always order more anyways , service was prompt .. food came relatively fast & very fresh. decor inside is refreshing compared to outside .. Facing a mcdicks ( eww ) but what can you do bout that , good location , but inside is nice and clean. price was very good for Japanese .. Let alone Chinese and Thai included .. That's legit ... & .. 10% off if you pay by cash !! That's amazing ! honestly I never thought id find a place like this downtown toronto , very reasonable pricing .. Sapporo beers 5 BUCKS , I would highly recommend you order the short ribs , so god damn BOMB DIGGITY.. !! 

real talk : id come again .."}
{"text":"I thought I'd already written a review on TCJ, but Yelp insists I haven't.  So, even though it's been over a month since I was there, I remember it well.  So, here goes:

I found this place by accident -- I ducked into an entranceway to get out of a sudden downpour and found myself looking into a simple, but clean Asian eatery.  Being a fan of Asian food, I said to myself, \"dinner time!\"

TCJ is an acronym for Thai, Chinese, Japanese, for all cuisines are represented on the menu.  There is another acronym in use here:  AYCE -- All You Can Eat.  Okay, I'm in!

Not a buffet.  TCJ hands you a menu and a pencil, and you order whatever you want.  Repeat as many times as desired.  They do indicate that you are expected to eat what you order, in an effort to save on food costs by people simply sampling.  All of the items I ordered were cooked superbly, from the Tom Kha soup to the house-special sushi TCJ roll.  Had I only known about their steamed dumplings, I might have just passed on everything else -- they are among the best I have ever tasted!

The next day at work, I mentioned TCJ to one of the locals, who replied that he passed it every day on the way to work, and had never tried it.  He is going to rectify that.  I recommend you do so, too!"}
{"text":"Cold maki in their bento box, literally COLD from the fridge cold. Rice around the maki got dry and hard. I would not come here again. I would rather have McDonald across the street, at least you are getting freshly prepared junk food."}
{"text":"The food was decent for an AYCE sushi place. The place was near empty while we were here, on a weekday night over Christmas, but they never rushed us to leave (which is good). They have a very large and spacious interior, so it's good for groups and I imagine they're normally quite busy if there were students in town.

Service was about on par with other ayce sushi places. We didn't get everything that we ordered and some extra items were delivered to our table (we would never order salmon sushi at ayce sushi dinner) which we had sent back. A hair was also found in one of the salads we ordered. Yuck!

They served a large variety of sashimi which we thought was good overall. They could have better removed the tissue that they used to soak the water - but at least we appreciate that it wasn't soggy. We never received the amount of sashimi that we ordered, so we had to keep ordering more and more. They did try to assemble the sashimi with a decent amount of presentation.

The quality of the rolls was average. We thought everything was generally pretty average here. The rolls were not stuffed with rice. The spicy salmon was great - get that.

The K.B.(B) Mussels were good. The beef short ribs were good, but they could be more tender. The har gow was ok. In general, most of the hot appetizers were ok. The avocado salad came doused in far too much dressing (and we would have preferred more avocado).

They have 10% cash discount, but only if you pay altogether. I'm not sure what the difference is if you pay cash separately or together to be honest, but that's just how it works."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. 

Both AYCE and takeout are great! The quality of food is right for the price you pay.

Staff is very friendly. 

I have not tried their Thai and Chinese dishes, but it's safe to say I love their Japanese dishes!"}
{"text":"Waitress did not know what is in their rolls, but the black dragon roll was ok (scrimped on the unagi/ eel). May return to try out the chinese or thai options."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was cuz I was really hungry but every single thing I ordered for the dinner all you can eat was so damn good . The curry pad Thai the chicken fried rice , basics that got it out of the park. The only thing is that it was really cold inside , like I was wearing a full sleeve velevet and shirt and my boyfriend was wearing a full sleeve button up and we were freezing our butts off inside. It got more and more cold the later we stayed and we thought it was probably cuz we were eating and our body is using its energy digesting instead of keeping us warm like always. But no it was just getting really cold, I don't wanna jump the gun and say they put it up cuz we were staying there almost to closing time and we were the only people there but I'm not sure. I could be worked on , it definitely interferes with our experience there. But over all good food , not such a good environment."}
{"text":"Been waiting forever for a place close to work that sells Pad Thai. The food was good. The price was also very good and the speediness of service was even better. I would recommend this place to friends and family. Maybe even strangers."}
{"text":"My friend and I dined in half an hour before closing (our bad). The service was blunt and we felt rushed to leave. We did the all you can eat and ordered a bit of almost everything. Everything tasted below average, and bland. The bill came up to $54 for two, and although that's an average price for all you can eat, this place was definitely not worth it. I wont be coming back here again."}
{"text":"This is mediocre quality Asian food in large quantities for a cheap price, plain and simple. 

They also have A.Y.C.E sushi which I have yet to try. Outside it looks a bit meh, but the inside is very nice or appears that way whenever I pop in to pick up a to go order. The lunch specials are nice, though we usually get 2 full sized dishes which can fed 5 people. Bargain. Nice big pieces of vegetables, sauces can be a bit watery, it's obviously greasy, but there is some good flavour going on. I normally talk about specific dishes in my reviews, but everything kind of fits what has been said so far."}
{"text":"Love this downtown AYCE. The prices are super reasonable, food is always great and service is fast. It's a hidden gem - don't get discouraged from the outside. Cheese wontons are epic."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised! When I heard about the price (~$15 for lunch) I was skeptical about the quality of the food. But no matter what the oriental dish: sushi, dimsum, Chinese dishes, pad Thai, curries, the quality was actually really great and the service is fast and efficient! 

You order with an iPad and they come right away when you submit the order. 

I'd definitely recommend coming here one day if you're craving Asian food!"}
{"text":"Not bad. But, not fresh, and lots of rice. 
Lots of variety, from Japaneses, Thai and Chinese. 
My friend and I went for an ayce on a Thursday night. They provide you with a 15% off deal if you pay by cash. It totalled to about 45$. 
I do not recommend the sashimi, although you normally go for it, it wasn't fresh, it also had a funny taste to it. 
The maki was overly wrapped with rice and very little toppings. 
For this price, it isn't bad for being in downtown. But, if you're from uptown, like me, you wouldn't choose to go to this place again haha."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from TCJ and waited with anticipation for them to open.

Since their opening, I've been to this place... well, at least ten times for sit in all-you-can-eat dinner, and have picked up items to go.

Every single time I am here, I am greeted by friendly and wonderful staff that are always at the top of their game when it comes to fast and polite service. They re-fill my drink as soon as they see it getting low, they remember my sister and I as regulars and always make light conversation with us.

As with most any other all-you-can-eat option, you CAN get charged for food that you don't eat. They serve everything in tiny portions to prevent food waste and if you want more, you can fill out a second or even third sheet or orders.
The portions are perfect for AYCE because they're small and you can try multiple things without worrying about wasting much food - especially if you're there with a larger group of people.

I'm not much into Thai food so I can't give an opinion on that section of the menu but some of my absolute favourite items to order are:

-Sweet & Sour Chicken-
I've always found the ratio of chicken to bread quite good. Most other places give you 80% bread and 20% chicken, whereas I'd say here they give you about 65% chicken and 35% bread - in tiny pieces, too!

-Cheese Won-Tons-
These come with sweet & sour sauce unless you ask them to hold it. They're pretty self-explanatory - DELICIOUS!

-Spring Rolls-
Not really the best spring rolls I've had, but they're decent enough compared to lots of other AYCE places.

-Kung Po Chicken-
Mine has always been nicely spiced - my only gripe is that they came with peanuts. I don't have an allergy or anything, I'm just not a big fan of peanuts. :P

-Beef Chow Mein-
This isn't on the AYCE menu, but I've had an order for pick up and I'd give it a 3.5/5. I've had much better chow mein, but this is good enough! Lots of beef!

-Miso Soup-
As good as I've had anywhere else, the take out containers are huge!

-Shrimp Tempura-
Self explanatory, also delicious! I've been to places with larger shrimps, but here I'd just order more to compensate. :P

-Pepper Steak With Onion- 
LOTS of onions and green pepper with this! Steak is always tender and tasty.

As for their sushi, I personally have found their rolls to be a bit dry. I'll typically order a roll or two (avocado rolls for the win!) but if I'm looking to go full on sushi mode, there are other places I'd rather eat.

The dining room has always been perfectly set up and clean when I've been in during the evenings.

All in all, I think this place is great and I encourage anyone to try it at least once!"}
