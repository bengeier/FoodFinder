{"text":"On a quiet day I decided to stop by Mnandi for a meat pie experience.  The Zimbawean version of a meat pie comes square shaped; standard meat pie fare like steak and onion are available, along with healthier choices like kale.  I had one kale, and one steak to balance things out.  You really do need to order two, or get one with the combo to have a filling meal.  At $5 each they are relatively affordable, so you can afford to try their 4 different flavours.  Would try again if I wander by the Scadding Court area."}
{"text":"Yet another unique new food stall in 707. This market totally rocks my world, especially when I'm hungry after a swim at the public pool nearby. There always seems to be something new to try and make my tastebuds come alive. This time it's Mnandi Meat Pies from Zimbabwe. I tried the Steak & Onion, but they also have Chicken & Mushroom, Carrot & Kale and Beef & Kale. They are reasonably priced at $4.99 each. I devoured one easily but I like the size, similar to a breakfast sandwich at the fast food place but alarmingly delicious. Obviously made by hand with love and care, these flake pastry pies are chock full of chunks of lean meat coated in a yummy gravy to die for. The other aspect, similar to other vendors at 707, is that there is a back story to this meat pie business, full of hope and inspiration, things that make life here so special and unique. I'm going to try the others soon!"}
{"text":"Never tried meat pies from Zimbabwe before. Since I was at Market 707 for a UYE, I figure now's a good chance to try it. Had the Veggie pie with carrots, kale and cremini mushrooms. Got there when they just opened so the pie was nice and warm; the outside was nice and flaky and the filling savory. The spicing reminded me of collard greens prepared in the South.   Conclusion? Meat pies from Zimbabwe are delicious!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this and was very disappointed. My steak and onion pie was served cold, burnt and had clearly been sitting around all day in the heating rack which was not even on.   It tasted like it could have been good if it was fresh and warm, but I won't bother going back to find out."}
