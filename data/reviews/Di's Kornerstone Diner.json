{"text":"Horrible ownership. Rude and inconsiderate of customers. I'm not one to usually complain but this place will never be in my list of places to eat."}
{"text":"Go only for breakfast.   Lunch and dinner were very over priced and the food was not good.  I got quite I'll from the thousand island dressing on my chef's salad. Won't return except for breakfast."}
{"text":"Had a thoroughly enjoyable Saturday lunch experience here. Get the pulled pork sandwich!! One of the best I've ever had. French fries were terrific also. Service was friendly and helpful. Look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Great diner fare (breakfast and sandwiches); BBQ is also good, but priced high.  We have been going there a few times a month for years (going back to the original location on 5th Ave) and the food and service has been consistently good.  Very highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for breakfast. They have a buffet setup, which is nice. They also had plenty of staff for a busy Saturday morning. Therefore, the service was great. However my food was fair. The bacon was soft and chewy and the French toast could have used a little longer on the griddle. The bathrooms are extremely clean, which is always a bonus."}
{"text":"Normally I would have given much higher rating, but today service was terrible , waited an hour for food, at least 15 min for coffee.  Waitress never came back with refills in that 45 minute period. Place was very crowded, but if your business is expanding hire more cooks and wait staff. Food was lukewarm. All in all very disappointing today."}
{"text":"Terrible owners!!! My family was asked to not come back because my nephew was misbehaving"}
{"text":"There was plenty of tasteless, lukewarm food on plate. Not even good diner food.   My husband and I enjoy too many other restaurants to come back here."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this establishment. We waited for our food for upwards of 45 minutes, and waited another 10 minutes just to get our check. The service was very poor. Each member of our party was served their food at different times, forcing half of our table to wait for everyone to be served, letting their food become cold. In addition to this, my order was incorrect, and another party member was served cold home fries. Given that everyone had only ordered breakfast, a 45 minute wait is uncalled for. Finally, our waitress never apologized for the delay, and was too busy on her cell phone to promptly give us our check after our food was finally served. I will not return."}
{"text":"In the area for a meeting that I showed up to early I decided to wait it out and get some breakfast. I did a quick yelp search and discovered that Di's Korner stone diner wasn't far away and boy did it cover what I needed. Walking in everyone seemed pretty chipper for the early morning happenings. They weren't busy yet and it seems to be a seat yourself kinda place which I personally enjoy so I did just that. I was created by Vicky and she quickly explained the specials and how they have a brunch buffet. I chose to search the menu ( which the full menu was available) and went with a simple breakfast platter of sausage gravy and biscuits, eggs, and home fries and I'm always intrigued by soups so I got a cup of their hot sausage special. The  soup was a bit greasy and I think the cook accidentally added croutons and cheese to it thinking it was their French onion (not  a big fan of soggy bread) but it was plenty hot and enjoyable other than that. Eggs were prepared nice, biscuits (I don't believe home made) were nice with the gravy and the home fries were nice and crisp.   Very filling meal for under $12. Miss Vicky told me about their car cruise ins and they sound like a fun time! Would definitely return for some more lunch appropriate items and try them out as well. My only complaint at all would be that the cook in the open window kitchen kept playing with his hat and hair with his gloves on and didn't change them before doing something else. Heavy set fella and I'm sure like most kitchens it's hot. Coming from a culinary background, that kind of stuff gets to me a bit tho. . But service was awesome and I enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Breakfast. The most important meal of the day. Sometimes places lose grasp on that concept. I think Di's is hanging on by a thread.   The Gang has been here twice in the past, and both times the food has just been...meh. Nothing spectacular. No \"holy cats, that's awesome\" or anything to blow me away.   The service, however, has been short of expectations both times. Waitresses are more worried about their food at the computer and less worried about bringing people their food and creamer for their coffee.   Di's does have a breakfast buffet, and that's kind of cool. I can't speak to its contents or it's quality, but considering Eat n Park is really the only place around that has that down, it's nice to see another business trying their hand.   It's hit or miss here. To each their own.   Happy Eating."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place, unassuming from the exterior, but the inside is really nice and appears to be very classic, it seems like you could be in a different era eating there! Food was great - I had a pulled pork sandwich which was fantastic. Service was attentive and coffee kept coming."}
{"text":"Typical diner food. Cute setup. The atmosphere is nice. Fast. If you're looking for a quick, hearty meal, stop here. However, it's not fancy."}
{"text":"This place met or exceeded my expectations for what I was looking for: a diner. These are hard to find nowadays. The entire place, including bathrooms were impeccably clean. Service was quick and friendly, and our breakfast food came out hot and flavorful. DELICIOUS sausage gravy, and breakfast! You will enjoy as long as you go in with the correct mindset: This is a diner, not a 5 star sit down restaurant, adjust expectations accordingly."}
