{"text":"I'm always looking for a high quality, value minded happy hour for an early dinner of appetizers.  If you're in Las Vegas for a show, or arrive from the east coast and are ready for dinner at 6:00 (it was 9:00 in NY and we had flown all day). this is a winner.   The bar area is table service with a dozen different choices for snacks that add up to a meal.  Sushi, and cocktails at a bargain price.   The pineapple martini is a hefty pour with flavor.    We (3 of us) ate and drank for an hour and a half in the bar during the aloha hour time period 5:00-6:30 pm.  We each had 2 cocktail drinks and more food than we should have,  we essentially had a full dinner from the aloha menu, with taxes and a 20% tip for superior service our bill was $78."}
{"text":"Any restaurant that produces such a delicious chocolate soufflee deserves full five stars. Its takes about 20 min after you ordered, but I consider this definitely as a good sign: It's fresh! Great seafood as well, by the way. But that's not important ;-)    However, if I compare it directly with my other five star locations, it just can't get more then four, sorry."}
{"text":"Very attractive decor along with excellent food and service. A great place for a night out with friends and relies but also for an intimate dinner for two. The Asian chicken with noodles was especially good. Pity we live in England otherwise this would be a real favourite of ours! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Roy's is Ohana with some pretty fancy plating! The food is light and flavorful but the service is outstanding!  My husband and I were celebrating our 12 year anniversary of meeting and he gave me a card at the table.  Our server Todd noticed the card and asked if we were celebrating so I told him   At dessert He brings out this pineapple upside down cake and written in Carmel sauce was Happy 12th anniversary and took our picture and made a copy and put it in a nice frame...Now That's service with Ohana!  Mahalo Roy's and Todd for a memorable evening!"}
{"text":"A group of buddies and I have been going here every time we visit Vegas - been going for over 12 years. This year was not their best effort.  Started when we were seated - they 'forgot' to even give me a menu.  Really?  Isn't that kind of 'seating 101'?   The food was 'good' but not 'great' like it has been in the past.  Then they had \"an issue with the oven\" and it took over 25 minutes to get our chocolate souffle.  And when we were done it took another 20 minutes to get our bill (although they did take the cost of these off the bill).    Should have thought something was up when at 7:30 there were only 4 other tables occupied in whole restaurant.  Really too bad, it used to be a really nice place with great food.  We will give it only one more chance - then it will show the beginning of a pattern."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! The Hawaiian (fusion) cuisine is the best I've ever eaten. The Sushi and all other seafood we had was delicious  I never thought raw fish could be that tasty, since I'm not really a seafood-fan. We've had a starter-plate, main dish and desert, and we could have kept eating The steak was on point and side dishes were fantastic as well. If you visit Roy's, don't choose the Fixe Menues. Instead, choose a la carte  it's more than worth it and you will taste the difference in quality! All in all it is a wonderful restaurant with a very fine atmosphere, eventhoug it is a chain. A little off the Strip, but worth every mile."}
{"text":"To start off, I have been a HUGE fan of Roy's for many years.  As time has progressed however, the restaurant has changed or deleted some of my favorite dishes from the menu.  On my last trip to Roy's, I took a lifelong friend who had heard me rave about this restaurant.  When he asked the waiter for recommendations, the waiter gave the specials and commented the butterfish was the most popular item on the menu.  I had recommended the butterfish as well, as I have had it many times and absolutely loved it.    When the dish arrived, I noticed something had changed, but couldn't quite put my finger on it.  It appeared to have some type of Pico de gallo on top, which seemed a bit unusual.  When I tasted it, I immediately knew something was wrong...........They changed the recipe!  I asked the waiter about this and was told that's the way it had been prepared since he started working there (approximately one month).   I voiced my displeasure with the new recipe and was offered another choice.  While I appreciated the offer, I didn't want to waste the food and finished the meal.    Upon completion of the dinner, the manager came over to speak with us.  I explained my disappointment with the change, and was told Roy's likes to change the recipes occasionally.  While I understand keeping the menu fresh, I am absolutely amazed a restaurant would change the recipe of their most popular dish.  Add that to the loss of personal favorites, the crab cakes and volcano roll, and I'm becoming a bit disenchanted with Roy's.  When I told my wife of the change, she was as disappointed as I.  She commented she had eaten at Roy's in Chicago recently and the butterfish was \"not very good\".  When I described the change, it became apparent she had been served the new incarnation of butterfish as well.    To end on a high note, the service was impeccable as usual, and the manager was extremely cordial and attentive.  The manager recommended calling ahead and requesting the dish be prepared the \"old way\" on the next trip."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Roy's in general.  I've been to his Hawaii Kai, Woodland Hills, LA and this location in Vegas.   There so many new restaurants that keep popping up in Vegas but why mess with a good thing.  I know I will get top-notch service and superior food.  The staff are extremely knowledgeable and will bend over backwards to handle any special requests.    I even got a Thank You card in the mail from the manager a couple weeks after dining there in early January.  True ALOHA spirit!"}
{"text":"Took a group of 12 on short notice. Treated 4 children perfectly (fed them at the right time and treated them like they were special). Server was very in tune with the mood of everyone and the food was great! Birthday guests got additional gift cards for a future visit! Expect to spend $50 per person, but the food, service and atmosphere were top notch! Well done Michelle! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We first had Roys in Kauai for our anniversary and loved it so much that we had to go back. we celebrated my husband's birthday here and they just make it so special in the little things they do like personalized birthday message on each plate and printing out a picture of us!  Every dish tastes amazing, and my go to is the tuna filet. The flavors and presentation is on point and the dining experience is always positive!"}
{"text":"Another great happy hour, too bad it ends at 6:30 but it is everyday. Get the wagyu beef sliders and anything with the miso butter sauce, ie ahi tuna roll and lobster potstickers for $5."}
{"text":"The Butterfish is phenomenal! Great for special occasions."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was excellent.  This is a good Restaurant for a Birthday or Anniversary Celebration."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Although it is not on the strip, I feel that this Hawaiian chain is as good as any of the top restaurants on the strip. Every time I go to Roys, I receive exceptional service and fantastic food. I love to go eat with my boyfriend and order a bunch of apps. Some of my favorites include, the backyard poke, lobster pot-stickers and the pork ribs. Will return as much as I can."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money on this overpriced restaurant.  On vacation from Boston, where the fish is always so fresh and delicious, I was hesitant to order the sea bass but it sounded so good, I thought I would give it a shot.   The waiter assured me the fish was fresh and that dish was cooked superbly.  It was not.  It was a skinny, flat piece of I-don't-know-what...it was supposed to have mushrooms but they were skimpy at best.  The entire dish was swimming in a sauce that was unrecognizable.  We waited for our second round of drinks which never arrived.  When the waiter brought the bill, he asked if everything was as he said and I said \"no, I am disappointed with the meal and service\".  He said he would let the chef know.  I talked to the manager afterward to let him know but he was not at all helpful.  He said he would talk to the chef.  Not feeling satisfied with his response, my husband talked to the manager of the hotel who told us the restaurant was not affiliated with the hotel but he would call one of the partners and would pass along our contact info.  Surprise, surprise - no call.  We thought that feedback would be important to pass along but apparently, it is not a priority for this overpriced, underwhelming restaurant.  The woman who continually filled our water was the only one hustling that night - I wish I had tipped her!"}
{"text":"We dine here once a year on the patio.  The entrées are always delicious.  The desserts are also delicious.  They also have a nice wine selection, friendly wait staff and excellent service.  The large patio is beautiful and inviting.  Make a reservation as it's always busy for dinner (other than summer)."}
{"text":"I went to Roy's last night for dinner.  We made it in time for happy hour which boasted $5.00 cocktails all of which were quite good.  We started with the lobster california roll and the aloha roll which isn't on the menu, so you have to ask.  The aloha roll has spicy tuna with fresh salmon and avocado.  Both rolls were fresh and delicious.  Next we had the short ribs, which were surprisingly good.  The flavor was wonderful and the meat was perfectly cooked, tender, but not too tender.  For dinner we had the skin on red snapper in a caper cream sauce.  It was fresh and perfectly cooked.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Have been here almost every time I come to Phoenix.  Love the atmosphere.  My daughter and father love the big salt water aquarium at the front door.  The service is always great.  The waitress the last time we went made our meal and spoiled my daughter.    Love the non-stop edamame, especially how it is seasoned.  I am never disappointed with the food that I order.  I am confident that no matter what I order, I will love it.  The portion size is perfect.   Although it is not ideal to bring my 11 month old, the staff were great and she loved it."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in Arizona. My wife and I have been here a few times and I must say we have never been dissapointed. The butter fish is truly amazing and they also have a nice selection if cocktails. We highly recommend experiencing what Roy's has to offer."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim and because I was craving fish.   First, I ordered the Lakanilau sushi roll which mainly consisted of a snow crab filling wrapped with a carpaccio-style wagyu beef. This was a unique roll and something i'd definitely recommend. I also ordered the Lobster Potstickers, which were pretty amazing. The potstickers came with an orange cream sauce which I'm not sure what it was.  For dinner, I ordered the Roy's trio and unlike the rest of this yelp crowd, I didn't think the Misoyaki Butterfish was THAT good. I didn't like how sweet the fish turned out and the tomato topping was a bit too sour for my liking. The fish was cooked perfectly though...it really did feel like butter.   The grilled Ahi was served perfectly, seared on the outside and raw on the inside. Even better was the white sauce that accompanied the fish.   But my favorite was the salmon. This is, if not, the best salmon I've eaten. The crust was charred to perfect and the middle was cooked to medium. It was ridiculously tender. I have no idea how the chef was able to achieve this, but it was great."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! The food was amazing and you must try the butterfish. Service was good and the price was very reasonable. Everything you can ask for in a restaurant. Wish this restaurant is near my house. Must go if you are in vegas"}
{"text":"Two wonderful Happy Hours so far and one was a holiday Sun!  Wonderful comfy sheltered patio The Calamari is different. Spiced breading, a fab sauce, so tender! Could eat it every wk. Lobster pot stickers, divine... again sauce is wonderful! The beef sliders are heavenly. The steak skewers were tender but did not take me like the other items. First trip our margarita's had to be sent back for additional agave syrup sweetening but second trip different bartender and they were great. First trip we entered, went to the patio and then had to call the restraurant asking for service and a menu. It was not busy so there was no excuse for poor service. Trip 2 they seem to have corrected this. Will be going again for the food. Friends did the Prix Fixe menu and said it was screaming good."}
{"text":"Let me start off with the positives the resteraunt is gorgeous. The service is top notch.  My girlfriend ordered the spicy seafood dish and it was really good. I ordered the lobster fillet. The lobster was really good  Now the negative the fillet was awful just disgusting. It was way too much pepper there was no flavor only pepper. I highly recommend staying away from the fillet mignon. You might regret if you ordered it. That's why I'm giving it two stars. I asked the waitress and she said that they haven't changed the seasoning. So not sure if I'm coming back or not."}
{"text":"AMAZING food! Due to unforeseen circumstances we showed up almost two hours late for our reservation and just before kitchen closed and they couldn't have been nicer.  Absolutely adore this restaurant, their service, and their food!"}
{"text":"Roy's recently changed their Aloha Hour menu (everyday, 4:30-6:30 pm) in their bar/patio area, so we stopped by to try some of their new dishes.  We love coming and enjoying some small bites and drinks on the patio for $5 each.  The portions are quite small, but the flavors are always good and the ingredients fresh.  We had the smoked mahimahi tacos and korean beef short rib tacos.  They come 3 to an order, and each is served in a little taro chip (see pictures).  The korean short rib was very tender and had incredible flavors, wish I could have just eaten a large serving of the meat itself as an entree :)  The smoked mahimahi reminded me of smoked salmon in flavor, and came topped with a jalapeño herb puree.  Both were delicious!  We also had our favorite, the tempura crusted spicy ahi roll and a new sushi roll, the big island ebi roll (shrimp tempura, avocado, cream cheese, mango, topped with a habanero aioli).  The combination of flavors in the ebi roll were quite good, but the serving of shrimp inside was practically non-existent.  I noticed too that the spicy ahi roll has considerably decreased in size, there used to be a much bigger portion and more ahi inside.  In the past we've had the wagyu beef sliders and the lobster potstickers, which were just okay.    The drinks are quite a good deal during the aloha hour.  All of their well and cocktail drinks are $5, Kona fire rock ale is $3, and they also have wines by the glass for $5.  My favorite drink there is the pineapple-ginger mojito, but they no longer have it on the menu (they now have a mango mojito).    When we have dined in the main dining room, my favorite appetizer is the Szechuan baby back ribs...they literally fall off the bone and are so flavorful.  The misoyaki butterfish is always a good choice for an entree.  I would not recommend the caramelized scallops, the texture is unappetizing and the dish seriously lacks flavor.  The Roy's melting chocolate soufflé is good, as is the pineapple upside down cake to end your meal.  Service is great in the dining room, we came for our anniversary one time and they printed out a menu with our names on it and gave us a complimentary mini dessert...what a nice touch!  However, most of the entrees are in the high 20 to 30 dollar range, and for our money we'd rather enjoy the small plates for $5."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Marriott Canyon Villas and went to Roys for Happy Hour.  Between 4:00 - 6:00 Roys has a great Happy Hour.  $5.00 drinks, including their Hawaiian martinis and $5.00 appetizers.  We had lobster pot stickers, tuna sushi, and California rolls.  All were delicious.  I've never eaten a meal at the restaurant but if you want a nice little buzz and a pretty full stomach in a lovely environment on a pauper's budget, this IS the place.  Don't miss it if you are nearby."}
{"text":"I love Roys, this is my ultimate spot to celebrate birthdays and special events.  For some reason though the butterfish tastes better at the location in summerlin, so that is where I always make my reservations."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times, but this review will focus on their Aloha Hour (happy hour) menu. This was previously one of our favorite places for happy hour. Sadly, things have gone downhill. Food items and cocktails from their bar menu are only $5 each, but value for your dollar varies depending on what you get. This time we got two orders of kobe sliders with sweet potato fries, calamari, filet mignon skewers with kimchi, tempura crusted spicy ahi tuna roll, and a passion fruit / mango sangria. The sliders were nice and juicy, but we didn't really care for the switch to a pretzl bread bun. The fries were solid but had too little of the truffle oil essence that they used to have. The calamari was the exception and an improvement over past iterations. There was a copious amount of meaty calamari tossed with an Asian soy and macadamia nut vinaigrette. The calamari at the bottom of the bowl got a bit soggy though. The skewers/kimchi were mediocre and very forgettable. The ahi tuna roll had very little tuna and was mostly rice. In the past, I've enjoyed Roy's various cocktails, but the sangria was a complete miss. The cocktail appeared devoid of any of the advertised passion fruit / mango puree. The description also mentioned a bunch of fruit but I only got 2 blueberries and an orange slice garnish.  To add insult to injury, service was inattentive despite the bar area being slow. Our water glasses sat completely empty for almost 10 minutes because our server was too busy chatting up the bartender. Eventually she came by to clear some our plates after which she still did not refill our water until we specifically asked her to.  Mediocre food + mediocre service = unlikely to return anytime soon. It's really a shame because we used to really like this place."}
{"text":"We want here on a Saturday  night. Our waiter was very attentive and knew the menu well. He gave great suggestions. I would recommend to come here it's a nice restaurant off the strip with great service."}
{"text":"Having dinner at Roy's was an AMAZING experience and I would rate it at 4.5 stars.   I was there with a large party (8 people) and a child. The service is amazing, with a very attentive wait staff. I was a little hesitant to eat here because I have a 1 year old daughter but they had a high chair all ready to go. Their \"Keikei\" (kids) menu was fabulous and it came with a chef's hat!! The chef even sent over an ice cream sundae for my daughter as a treat for being so good. How awesome is that?!  I got a free martini for my yelp check-in and it was STRONG! The food is amazing!! I got the salmon and it was wonderful, some of the other items ordered by my group was the filet, the scallops, the mahi mahi, all were delicious. My husband order the calamari appetizer as an entree and the waiter asked him a few questions and he received an amazing custom calamari and noodle entree! The desserts were also great! We had the mango cobbler, which was sweet but not over powering and the nut tart was great too!  The reason for the 4.5 stars is because in the bathroom they had these small square wicker-ish baskets as the trash cans, they didn't have lids or anything so you could see everything that was in them. I just thought it was really odd and a not what I expected from that caliber of a restaurant.   Overall the whole experience was great and I would highly recommend Roy's to others and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I almost gave this a two star rating until finding out my dad is violently sick tonight after our dinner where he commented on the chicken seeming \"funny\". We dined on the Travel Zoo special menu and the only thing noteworthy were the spring roll apps. Potatoes would be better served with a straw. Completely not worth the money...steer clear!!"}
{"text":"Had my birthday dinner at Roy's while vacationing in Vegas. My sister's fiance is the manager there and had a special dinner set up. Some of the items off the menu were the Mahi Mahi, Salmon and the Spiced Ribs. All awesome!! Props to the Chef for his other dishes! 5 stars for the food and service."}
{"text":"Went to Roy's last Roy's last Friday night for my anniversary had the short rib it was tasty but cold got the I ordered the 8-ounce filet mignon and lobster tail they informed me they were out of fillets and they would give me a 14-ounce ribeye when the plate came it was like an 8 ounce Ribeye very tough not good the lobster tail was delicious my wife got the butterfish which was also delicious.."}
{"text":"Took a group of customers to this location, received some of the worst most unprofessional treatment from the GM Jaye Sechrest.  Ironically our company is in the restaurant industry and I can tell you our entire staff as well as our customers were stunned at the treatment.  We spent $2500 and were treated like second rate citizens.  Would never recommend this restaurant as long as this is their General Manager.  Horrible experience for my employees and our customers."}
{"text":"I heard that the chocolate souffle would change my life.  You better believe I was expecting a chocolate-dipped Robert Pattinson to burst out of my dessert upon arrival.  And then he would charm me with his British wit and make love sick promises to me while we polished off the molten chocolate heaven on a plate.  So bearing these expectations in mind, it was a bit of a disappointment.  But if you're looking for straight up chocolate souffle, Roy's isn't a bad place at all.  The dinner was very good (try the Scallops) and the waitstaff was extremely attentive.  The atmosphere felt a little sterile for such a pricey place; I really think they could do more to make it feel more like a hot date spot, not business lunch.  I think the food deserves it.  But all in all, a good time was had by all.  I will unfortunately have to keep searching for the, ahem,  dessert mentioned above."}
{"text":"Ordered the following:  Crispy Kraage Calamari - The calamari was really tender and cooked nicely.  The batter was light.  I preferred the Yuzu Aioli sauce over the Thai Basil Macadamia Nut Pesto which was a little strange.  Chili Pepper Scented U-10 Scallops & Herb Crusted Black Tiger Prawns - The entrée came with 3 large scallops and 3 large prawns.  The scallops and prawns were cooked well and had a natural flavor.  The butternut squash risotto was delicious and complimented the seafood nicely.  I got to try a piece of the Aloha Roll which was yummy.   I also got to taste the Butterfish which just melted in your mouth.  The service was excellent and the timing of the food was perfect.  I would definitely come back here on a future trip."}
{"text":"Came to this hotel on a business trip and Roy's is conveniently located on the first floor.  It is very busy during dinner time. Make reservations beforehand.  I ordered the salmon entree. Cooked very well and the fish was very juicy.  Seasoning was great. Portion was a bit small.  The service was excellent.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We had read several grumpy negative reviews of Roy's Desert Ridge about their Aloha(Happy) Hour but were determined to try it since we had memorable experiences in their Hawaiian location.  It far exceeded our expectations including the campy Tiki Torches in the outdoor dining area and the super guitarist who entertained us.  I enjoy Mai Tai's and am fussy about the ingredients.  Wow, they delivered!  Melissa, our server was a special bonus to a special evening.  Her reviews of the Bar Bites were on the mark - especially the Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs.  Not crazy spicy and deliciously juicy and tender.  $70 total for four drinks and four appetizers.  Not bad, eh?  Are we going back for another Aloha Hour?  Are you kidding?"}
{"text":"Very decent place.  Friendly staff and mpst of all food was so delicious. My boyfriend and I decided to make a recervation on Valentine's day omg from apetizer soup entree all the way to our desert was all excelent.  Five star"}
{"text":"Wow! Glad I picked this place. The food and atomosphere was excellent. Whenever I'm in vegas I like to eat somewhere new. While it is of the strip and I did not know what to expect Roy's was the perfect choice for seafood and I will return. Our server Tiffany was a delight and her recomendations were spot on. I recomend to all friends who go to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. All staff members are very kind and polite. Perfect place to go for a special day."}
{"text":"We love Roys. The service is usually outstanding and the food is wonderful.The ambience is nice and usually pretty hopping on a Saturday.  My water glass is constantly being refilled because the people Roy's employ are totally on the ball. We have dined here 8+ times over the past 2 years and have never had a mediocre meal. They also have a delicious vegetarian menu if you ask your server. The wine list is comprehensive and they are known for their creative cocktails.We have dined here on both special occasions and regular Saturday nights. It is kind of like being on vacation when we go since it is located in the gorgeous JW Marriott. ...definitely in my top three Phoenix area restaurants."}
{"text":"Never in a gazillion years would I expect to take people to a Roy's and have a bad food experience - pigs are flying.  I took some employees and their spouses out for a year end thank-you dinner. While the lobster potstickers and spicy tuna appetizers were great, that's where the good part of the meal ended. My butterfish, usually mouth watering yumminess was so-so and served with white rice. Other dishes at the table like the swordfish and petite filet were dry and flavorless. I'd prefer not to delve more into the embarassment that was this dining experience....needless to say I have since eaten at the Chandler Roy's and had my faith restored - but I pressed my luck at the JW location and pulled up a big Whammy."}
{"text":"When my husband and I were thinking of a place to celebrate our wedding anniversary, we thought of Roy's, since we were married in Hawaii. It was one of the best decisions that I have ever made.  This was one of the best dining experiences that I've ever had.  First, their Aloha hour drinks are delicious! I could feel the warm ocean breeze as I sipped my Hawaiian martini and my hubby drank his Mai Tai (for only 5 bucks! Everything on the happy hour is only $5).  We dominated the happy hour. Everything was delicious, especially wagyu sliders and the ahi roll. YUM.  For dinner, I had the sea bass which was AMAZING. The husband had surf and turf- lobster tail and filet mignon. It was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  For dessert, we had a rich chocolate cake that they brought to us for our anniversary. We had the best time.  The service was outstanding. We sat at the bar and had a wonderful time with our bartender Larry. Since this Roy's was inside a hotel, it had a great, relaxed atmosphere.  We've since been to other Roy's locations, and they were NOT as good (even the Roy's in San Fransisco!). I can't wait until we can go back!!! If you get a chance, come here for Aloha hour. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cute setting in the Marriott- food ok; I have-veggie roll which had mango it was interesting, hubs had a trio of fish tried it over powered by butter which if fish is fresh you don't need butter only salt pepper  anyway Lots of sides potstickers again too much oil... everything was smothered in butter or oil. Go for the drinks"}
{"text":"Overrated, service is good but the food is not what I expected. Won't be going here for a second time."}
{"text":"The service was great and the atmosphere was fun.  We took an interviewee for my husband's company out and had a lovely time.  My husband thought it was a little pricey, but I think three people who were drinking, ordered an appetizer and had three entrees for just a little over $200 was pretty reasonable.  Especially given the unique entres and the amazing service.  I had the white truffle and black pepper scallops and they were amazing.  The pesto rice stuff they were on was sooooooo good.  Had to try the chocolate soufle after reading all the reviews on here and it was yummy, but by that time I was EXTREMELY full!  We'd do it again anytime."}
{"text":"The food is very good.  It's worth a trip just for the Hawaiian Martini.  :)   Nice ambiance and great service."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, nice location away from hotel casino. Perfect for business dinner out of town guests."}
{"text":"This place has absolutely delicious, albeit pricey food, which I enjoyed for free because I attended a pharm lecture here. The appetizers were scrumptious. For my entree, I had the macademia crusted mahi mahi, which practically melted in my mouth. The variety of desserts were amazing too...my favorite was the chocolate souffle. Service was excellent. Hopefully one day I'll be able to afford a meal here on my own. ;) In the meantime, I'm going to attend another lecture here and try a different entree!"}
{"text":"Our #1 place for fresh fish, here in the Arizona desert, and for steaks that absolutely melt in your mouth. Be sure to try their renowned pineapple upside down cake and the molten chocolate cake, both are baked to order. You have never tasted anything like Roy's take on Asian fushion, and somebody told me the food is all spicy but that is not so! The blending of flavors is deftly accomplished, so that no one ingredient ever stands out excessively. Service is attentive. And I do not know of ANY other place that makes your special celebration day this special, and it is accomplished in the most elegant style. We celebrated our wedding anniversary here last night, and we were treated like visiting royalty. Perfect!"}
{"text":"I usually LOVE Roy's. We used to celebrate every family birthday there and reserve it as our special occasion spot. The last time we went we still thoroughly enjoyed the amazing food but our waitress was awful. She was rude, had no idea about any of the items on the menu when we asked a few basic questions and kept treating us as though she was irritated to have to serve us. Because Roy's is usually known for their great customer service I actually wrote to them to tell them about my experience and provided the waitress's name so they would know she is in serious need of some additional training at the very least. Unfortunately they never wrote back to me or acknowledged the feedback in any way. Will likely give it another chance with hopes that our next server is better!"}
{"text":"Another review site had this as the top restaurant in town so we decided to try it.  It is very good.  It is very expensive.  The waitress pushed the alcohol consistently, but politely.  We don't drink so it was wasted effort -- I should have been blunt that we don't drink so she was save her effort.    I'd go here again if it were a special occasional and I'm ok dropping $50 per person."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations for drinks and apps during Aloha Hour. Great food, drinks and service. Ben found out we were getting married, brought us a congratulaory desert and provided us with a commemeratory photo. Thank you Ben for a great experience."}
{"text":"Very pleased with our choice to go to Roy's!   The ambience and service was great, and the food was even better!    The Butterfish seemed to be the favorite of the group, but the surf and turf and sushi rolls were excellent as well!    I saw tips to get the chocolate soufflé, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed. It was really a molten chocolate cake, NOT a soufflé. It was delicious, but not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Excellent ambiance. Slow service.  Reservations are definitely recommended.  Drinks: Basil Cucumber Collins. --Highly recommended. Mai Tai --Very good. The basil cucumber concoction is definitely better than the mai tai.  Complimentary to the meal is edamame, lightly salted. Absolutely delicious.   For main course, I had ordered the Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut crusted Mahi Mahi. It flaked upon touched, melted in your mouth with every bite, and had the most savory buttery mashed potatoes. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here.   For desert, I ordered the Roys' Melting hot chocolate Souffle. You MUST try this. The souffle is served with vanilla bean ice cream.   Overall, a very good meal. I would definitely visit again ."}
{"text":"My dear love and I have had a few meals here and we have had nothing but great food and great service. The happy hour seems like an excellent value but we just havent been able to get it together sufficiently to get in there on time. We prefer sitting in the bar, because you can sit a cote. The poke is excellent, as of course it should be. We will be back, many times."}
{"text":"Okay you got me.  Came back to Roy's for my anniversary after a disappointing Valentine's day feast.  A much different experience. We dined on the patio with a perfect evening.  The food was better and more reasonably priced.  The staff was awesome. Caleb and Emiliano did everything they could to ensure everything was first rate.  I enjoyed myself and I know my wife did as well.  She had Butter Fish and it was excellent.  The appetizer was delicious and the portions were just the right amount.  Roy's did everything to delight us and I'm sure they'll do the same for you."}
{"text":"Loved It!!!!  My boss took the office staff and i to celebrate my 7 year anniversary at work. The waiter, Dan, was AWESOME! He gave us great service, he was attentive and informative (explained the menu). He congratulated me as soon as he presented himself, which was very sweet. When I opened the menu I found a lovely sheet of pink paper congratulating me also, I received a free dessert as well, with a candle and another congrats written in chocolate!!  It was very personal.  The food was amazing and the drinks were well mixed and delicious! We all tasted eachothers food since most of us had never been there...The calamari was unlike any i've ever tasted, i'd gladly take it as an entree!! The butterfish melts in your mouth, the mashed potatoes and pork chops were both very good. I had a very pleasant evening. I would greatly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have lived in Las Vegas just over a year now. I pass by this place weekly and have wanted to stop in for some time. My partner and I have dined at many of the Roy's locations in Hawaii as well. I tend to be very critical of food & service when dining out. I like my restaurant experience to appeal to all my senses. Tonight we took out some friends of ours for a nice dinner and decided in Roy's. I honestly would have to say that from out first interaction with the hostess untill the point when we left the restaurant it had to have been THE ABSOLUTE BEST DINING EXPERIENCE WEVE HAD IN LAS VEGAS EVER. Our server was beyond attentive,personable,sincere,and accommodating. The fish perpetration a and quality rivaled that of many restaurants I'm used to in Hawaii. Amazing night,Amazing Service,and Amazing food."}
{"text":"I usually love Roy's but this visit  was just okay. I had the kona coffee pork and it was seriously lacking in flavor. The service was excellent as usual."}
{"text":"Received a card for $20 when I dined at Roy's for my birthday. The waitress explained that I could use it at anytime. I went to Roy's today during the aloha hour and was told I couldn't use the card. The lobster potstickers were soaked in the butter sauce and the crab fried rice was bland. Before today I enjoyed the food and atmosphere but after my experience today I won't be back.   Thanks for the disappointment."}
{"text":"It should be no surprise that the ambience and service at this restaurant located inside a 5 star resort is impeccable. What is heartening though is that the food is good as well. What was even better of course was that i wasnt paying for it:) (business dinner)  We had crab cakes and pork ribs for appetisers which was delicious. For the main course i had the Ahi with the mustard sauce that was so flavorful. My colleagues had the shrimp and butterfish and they liked their dishes as well. For dessert we had the upside down pineapple cake.  I really enjoyed my  experience here and would recoomend it to those who love seafood and want an evening of fine dining."}
{"text":"Best service we have had in a long time. The food was good, the atmosphere is excellent, and our server was super attentive and funny. Peach Bellini martini was awesome."}
{"text":"Extraordinary!!! We had never been to a restaurant with such attention to detail. Upon making our reservations they asked if we were celebrating a special occasion, we told them we were just on our honeymoon :-) when we arrived we were greeted with a congratulations and were even presented with an Aloha certificate and a framed picture after dinner. The food was delicious!!!! Everything was cooked to perfection. There is not enough compliments that could be given. Best of all, it was a great bang for the buck."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Roys all over the map, starting with the first restaurant in Hawaii Kai on Oahu, and so it has a special place in our hearts.  If we are in a city with a Roy's and it's a special occasion, we always try to get one meal in at Roy's.  If you like Pacific Rim/Asian Fusion Cuisine, this is the place to check out.  The quality is incredibly consistent and we have never been disappointed.  Naturally, the service is very attentive but not over bearing, and the atmosphere is a little more romantic than many other hip places (quieter, more dimly lit).  They have a nice selection of deserts to finish the evening!"}
{"text":"This place was good. I think I had lofty expectations as it is listed as the number one restaurant in Las Vegas on Trip Advisor and was disappointed when I wasn't blown away. Don't get me wrong, it easily could have been the 30th best restaurant in Vegas but definitely not number one.  The first item I took issue with is the service was really slow. I get that everything is made to order but it was a Sunday evening at 7pm and the restaurant was only half full, there was no reason for us to have waited 30 minutes for our appetizer of Lobster pot stickers and a California roll and then another 30 minutes for our entree and so on through dessert and the check.  Additionally, I found the idea of a Hawaiian fusion restaurant intriguing and I think I was disappointed that what I picture as Hawaiian flavor made such a weak appearance. Where was my exotic fruit plate or roasted pork with pineapple sauce? I wanted some sweet and savory grilled filet kabobs or something but instead the offerings were what one could find on the menu of any fine dining chain. Scallops, Filet, California roll etc. Been there done that.  If you must eat here, I recommend the following POA- 1. Allow yourself a solid 3 hours to dine 2. Forget that you're at a Hawaiian restaurant and pretend it's a Ruth Chris with Hawaiian decor  3. Order the chili fried rice. It wasn't too spicy and it was especially light and tasty."}
{"text":"Well, this marks the third Roy's for my wife and I.  All have been threes ...I would rate service a solid four - and consistently so.  So, the \"issue\" is that the concept just doesn't work ...sure, the food is overpriced (and increasingly so), but in order to do the corporate alignment thing, the quality of the food and the \"magic\" just gets fuzzed up to the point, it is not really any better than eating at a run of the mill Marriott restaurant run by a moderately innovative staff and management team.  The whole Hawaiian-ish theme is overwraught ... yeah, it's cool to have the edamame as a bit of difference, but bread with dinner is there for a reason ...not having it looks and feels cheap - like you're trying too hard to be cool in high school?  An alternative that should be explored, especially in the busy resort setting, is to play the local food theme with local ingredients and local flavors ...with enough basics like a couple of classic dishes in each category to allow someone who is visiting for a week to be happy sampling ...it just felt so, well, blah and predictable.  There are some great chefs out there - and some innovative management teams ...perhaps even take a look at the Houston's chain, or the Mike's chain (in Washington, DC area) for ideas.  We've done out three Roy's ... the lunch we had at the spa at the resort was actually better ....and, there was a sense people had been involved in developing the menu - not a collective committee of marketing staff."}
{"text":"Food was fair. We have been to the other Roys at JW much better. Had steak which was fair for the price. Mashed potatoes had no taste and looked like cheap instant potatoes. Deseret was sent back as it was cold and not fresh. In the end we paid like $80 for meal. It was a waste of money. Won't go back to this one again."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her birthday.  What a pleasant surprise.  When I made reservations I told them we had a 6:30 show to get to after dinner.  Once we got there, everyone from the valet guy to the hostess and our waiter knew about our timeline.  The service was top notch!  My wife even got something in her eye and one of the servers offered to let her borrow her makeup.  The food was right up there with the service...outstanding!  We ordered from the Prix Fixe  menu, which is a great deal. Not sure if they always bring out little treats complimentary from the chef, but we were served a couple bites of a california roll with fresh crab...best CA roll I've ever had!  We had the  Shrimp Cakes and Scallops for appetizers, Trout on cous cous w/ mushrooms and the petit filet with some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had for the main course.  Of course how can you not get the warm chocolate cake for dessert!  Amazing!  Perhaps it helped that Roy himself was in the kitchen inspecting the food as it went out.  I love restaurants where you can see what's going on in the kitchen.   Highly recommend for any sort of special occasion, or if you just want delicious food.  You can't beat the service or the food."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The butterfish is absolutely heavenly.  Probably the best fish I have had in town.  Great service and excellent food.  A bit pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Wow, I've lived all over the world and I think I had my best seafood dish ever in Chandler Arizona. For starters they brought my toddler a small quesadilla with veggies, ranch and apples, fantastic! He loved it and quieted down so that mom and I had a chance to relax and order. The calamari was great. My wife liked the salmon and I was really pleased with the special, dynamite baramundi. No kidding it was the best dish I can recall eating! The service was perfect, very attentive and friendly. Most definitely we will return and recommend to friends. Way to go!"}
{"text":"Went here last weekend for a birthday celebration and was very disappointed. We didn't get appetizers until an hour and half since we sat down and that's after we asked for bread or something (which we were THEN told they have complimentary edamame). We spent so much money and they messed up the salads and forgot items...all with the server apologizing that they didn't think they'd be busy (even though we had reservation). The whole time a manager didn't stop by and we sat next to a loud obnoxious party. I gave 2 stars for the beautiful ambience, but the portions were small and taste and service not great for these prices."}
{"text":"Excellent, very nice ambience. Waiter was fantastic very knowledgeable about menu and requested recommendations. First time customer. Had the sushi roll \"sunrise at Haleakala\" and Lobster potstickers for appetizer. Probably could have eaten a dozen.  Sushi was fresh, rice \"hint of\"vinger.. Had sorbet samplers. This restaurant has a full exclusive dinner menu. $$-$$$ and wine list. Faint at heart, I'm sure the quality that went it making my sushi will definitely carry over to the entrées. A great restaurant. Definitely come back try one of the entrées."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant, food is good, price is reasonable and staff is nice.  We had a 3-course dinner set, I had pork-belly, steak and strawberry bread pudding. I like the pork-belly and the steak, they were delicious. The portion of the dessert was a bit much and I was not into that taste.  Our server, Jerry was smart and nice and gave detailed information about the food. Service you received here was much greater than what you got in some 5-stars restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour and b day gave us free bday cake and framed photo! Thx Roy!"}
{"text":"I had a very underwhelming experience compared to the other reviews here. The service was sub-par, wait staff were busy and missed us sitting in the bar area for a while, then I ordered a drink that never came. Appetizers were good and an OK value. The entree was a major let down, I ordered the $40 shellfish sampler and I felt jipped. Small pieces of seafood that were overcooked and left me unsatisfied. I think they were frozen. I would not recommend the dish. I had to order the Aloha rolls afterwards to fill me up, which were decent.  Overall there are much better happy hours and dinner places around town, this spot is located alongside a lot of other high end restaurants and probably benefits from location greatly. 2/5"}
{"text":"Very good option, their Blackened Ahi Tuna with mustard sauce was excellent, they seared it very finely on the outside keeping fish cold and raw on the inside, mustard sauce complemented the dish beautifully. Good choice for sushi quality fish outside of sushi places."}
{"text":"New: We came back after the earlier reduced rating. We must have had an off night or bad waiter last time. We decided to celebrate our anniversary one more time here, and we're glad. The food was amazing, and service was much more the norm.   We came to the special Roy Yamaguchi dinner and wine pairing. It was fabulous. Roy made an appearance and was so nice. He took pics with those of us taking part in the special dinner pairing, as well as the regular dining crowd. That was a great treat. Best of all, we had the special happy anniversary dessert. Loved it! Thanks.   Old:  So, I still enjoy coming here - mostly. And I wish I could do 31/2 stars. But I've not been as happy with the service. It was our 21st anniversary at our most recent visit...and no flowers on table (at first), no card, no special treat - we used to get a mini dessert with happy anniversary on the plate. Even the upside down pineapple cake didn't have happy anniversary on the plate. Super disappointing. Good food and cocktails overall, though. But my rare filet was more medium rare. Our waiter didn't check back to make sure all was good before we were mostly finished. And we got a frown when we tried to use a $20 off coupon. Hopefully next time will be better for the amount paid."}
{"text":"One star for providing wifi that requires creating an account to use. Seriously? Other than that great place."}
{"text":"Went here for a business dinner. Excellent service. I ordered a steak, it was good but this place is definitely more of a seafood restruant."}
{"text":"Great dinner with an awesome menu and fresh fish that is perfectly cooked.  Do not miss out on the chocolate soufflé."}
{"text":"Great food and service. First time here and will definitely be back.  Ordered the creme brûlée and brought it out and said that it was completely \"set\". Which it wasn't. Still watery like. They didn't charge us for it and even gave us a $20 gift certificate to have one next time. I wouldn't of brought it out to begin with but either way great service"}
{"text":"Third time here.  This time was disappointing. Lobster potstickers were good.  Wife's filet was tasteless with no seasoning and the short ribs were like eating mothers bland pot roast. No flavor at all. Not worth $100 for sure.  Should've got the fish."}
{"text":"I stopped in t check this place out last friday and was not let down.... OMG from the food to the prices here ( which I expected t pay three times more ) I just loved this place/ One of my new regular hangout places I think."}
{"text":"If you ever need a good Hawaiian Fusion place to eat at, Roy`s will satisfy your tastebuds! They are considered fine dining hoewvwer they run Monday specials and they are worth very penny. Everything from the  superb service to the delicious menu its utter perfection!"}
{"text":"Last evening my husband used the online reservation form  to book a table at Roy's and confirmed in the special occasion box that it was our anniversary.  Roy's is located just off the main Las Vegas Boulevard and for reasons I will explain, well worth the extra for a taxi. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant an hour later, we were congratulated by the staff, there was even a welcome congratulations on the inside of the menu.  We chose the set menu and were very satisfied.  If there was just one doubt, it would have to be that as I don't eat meat, there was only one appetizer selection for me.  I have no problem with seafood and the trout was cooked to perfection.  Prior to the meal, we were given a \"tapas\" of a lobster potsticker.  The service was impeccable. Before desert, a large square plate arrived with a small desert and a chocolate inscription wishing us a Happy Anniversary and including our names.  A photograph was taken and presented to us in a frame at the end of the meal.   It is really nice to be appreciated as customers especially when the food and atmosphere lives up to the occasion."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, I tried to eat there 2 different times and had to walk away both times.     Hey Marriott, get rid of this pathetic restaurant and replace it with good management and better atmosphere."}
{"text":"I suppose I am a little biased when it comes to rating Roy's because I am a huge fan of fusion restaurants, but Roy's still takes the cake especially the one in Phoenix. The menu is created daily and is always very creative. The chefs do an amazing job of combining different flavors so that they complement, but don't overpower, each other. The only reason I am giving them four stars instead of five is because the quality at the other locations hasn't been quite the same as the Phoenix one. But for anyone who loves fusion, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"For the price; definitely not worth a visit  I would definitely not return to this restaurant; although based on other reviews I might try one in a different city.  The service was not good.  We were seated by a very inexperienced host and our main waitress seemed to be very new and moved from \"stalking us\" to ignoring us for long periods of time.  In addition, the food was good but not up to par with the prices.  I had the seafood sampler and the lobster was on par to something you would get at Red Lobster (it was small and overcooked)-seriously.  My husband had the seafood quad (not on the menu) and said all of the fish (except the tuna which was served raw) was overcooked.  We did enjoy the beef spring rolls; although the presentation was really odd...they looked like three soggy cigars when they came out; but they were delicious.  Finally we had the chocolate desert that you have to order ahead...I had one bite; it was not worth the calories.  We did enjoy the wine...Fess Parker Ashley but we found by the second bottle that we needed to move it to the other side of the booth because our waitress kept over pouring our glasses...it was crazy.   Anyway, hope you have a better experience."}
{"text":"We went there on New Year's Eve. Food was terrible. I got prime rib medium. It was like shoe leather. My family's meals were bad as well. Very expensive and NOT worth it. Marriott should be ashamed of itself for having such a restaurant in its upscale resort. Look at many other reviews that rate it at a 1 or 2. Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"First point: Roy's is a chain.  Not a Applebee's-esque chain, but a chain. They offer a large menu with some items that appear at every location and the remainder of the menu is left to Chef to write.  Second point: Decent portion sizes.  The apps were a bit on the skimpy side, but the entree made up for it. You get quite a selection from sushi and nigiri to Hawaiian BBQ or a selection of fresh fish. The prices are a bit high, but nothing like you would pay on the strip.  Third point: Excellent Service. Around but not annoying.  My one pet peeve: just like every other restaurant, they HAD to go and put a raspberry sauce with the chocolate dessert. It's been done. Do something different. Better."}
{"text":"Food was great. Hostesses were spotty but other servers were fine. If you're staying at the JW it's the best restaurant there with the best atmosphere."}
{"text":"The dish was great. Service was wonderful. It was my Birthay and they had a note in the menu wishing Happy Birthay. They also gave a cake with a candle. Everything was great. Prices were fair for a place like that. It is worth to visit it"}
{"text":"I am usually never a fan of chain restaurants but this was hands down one of the best meals I've ever had... Started with the king pao calamari which was perfectly fried and a good spicy that I think anyone could handle. Had the roys trio for main course and every single fish was amazing not to mention the sushi rice served with it. And chocolate soufflé for desert... ALL AMAZING. Eat here - you will not regret it.   Customer service superb. Drinks superb."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!   My girlfriend and I went to Vegas to celebrate her birthday and I was seeking a restaurant for her birthday dinner. After comparing prices, locations, and the reviews of restaurants near the strip, I decided to make a reservation at this Roy's location. Reservation is easy! You can make your reservation online, and make a note about special occasion and the foods that you are allergic to. After making the reservation, I called them twice (once to change my reservation time, another one to check dress code) and they were responsive and friendly on the phone.   Once arrived, we were greeted by a very friendly hostess/server. She immediately confirmed my girlfriend's birthday and avocado allergy, and my girlfriend was pleasantly surprised. Throughout the dinner, there were some little surprises for the birthday girl (I won't spoil the details - don't worry, not the usual happy birthday song). My girlfriend ordered the Garlic Rubbed Hawaiian Tombo, which was excellent. I had the Roy's Trio with salmon, mahi mahi and butterfish. The salmon was fresh, but it's the misoyaki mahi mahi and butterfish that really impressed me. They were exceptionally good. For my future visits, I will have their butterfish for sure.   Additionally, the easy parking and the location (near the strip but away from the heavy traffic) made this visit an easy trip. The entire experience was wonderful overall and I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and nice staff overall, our waiter could have been better - but overall it was nice place to enjoy an evening of great food!"}
{"text":"Heerlijk eten, zeer vriendelijke bediening. Echt een aanrader en nette prijzen. Echt een uitje. Als we weer naar vegas gaan gaan we er zeker weer eten"}
{"text":"Staying at this hotel this was the best place to get great seafood dishes. We have been at Roy's before in other locations. This one was specially great. The lobster dumplings and the spring rolls as started were ok. My dish; the Mahdi Maui with macadamia nuts crust was excellent. We had the lava brownie/chocOlate cake with ice cream for desert, it was very good."}
{"text":"We went to Roy's our last anniversary dinner and loved it. We chose it based on location and reviews and noticed on their web site that they had a Prix Fixe special for Monday nights that allowed you to choose almost anything on the menu. We found out it was the last Monday they were offering it when we called to make same-day reservations. They asked if it was a special occasion, and I told them it was our Anniversary. They went above and beyond to make it a special experience with \"Happy Anniversary\" printed in our menu and taking a souvenir photo for us to keep, and the special dessert with our names as well.  Everything was excellent! The chocolate souffle was to die for! Grey Goose martini with blue cheese stuffed olives was a treat. Service was really top notch all the way through. We felt like we got a great value and a memorable experience.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food and service above par. The fish is fresh. Decent, varied wine list. No sommelier."}
{"text":"finished up restaurant week 2009 with a light but solid pre fixe $30 dinner at Roy's Fusion Restaurant. The bonus? The contribution they make to 3square.org.  Didn't try anyone else's dishes but i chose the appetizer trio of shrimp, pork shortribs and more pork (szechuwan style), came also with a trio of sauces. i was licking my fingers just to savor every last bit.It was a tossup choosing between my favorites:  the pecan crusted rainbow trout or the herb crusted shrimp. chose the latter and glad i did. they served it with a mushroom and lobster risotto that was divine (lick fingers, check, now lick plate! check)  2 friends got the maui onion sirloin and multi spiced pork chop and raved about them. The perfect wine pairing i had was a glass of mer soleil from ca, not a wine connoisseur myself, but it tasted citrusy with a slight smoky flavor.  i was so proud that i picked it myself.  dessert was the perfect fluff end to dinner, delicately light, upside pineapple cake with homemade coconut infused vanilla ice cream. sorry, no pics to share, i gobbled it up at warp shutter speed.  For what it is, can't wait to go back to try their regular menu; even if it's a chain. Service was timely, the food was worth every penny, and the proceeds went to a great cause.  All considered, a well-rounded 5 stars."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner with my mom at the Roy's was delightful. We enjoyed food, the outdoor seatings, and the beautiful surroundings.   - Crispy Karage Calamari -  This was definitely one of the best calamari I had! It was indeed crispy, and more flavorful with the thai basil dipping sauce, yum!  -Misoyaki Butterfish - This white fish was light and somewhat creamy, so soft that could just melt into your mouth.  -Brown Butter seared Salmon - A bit towards to the sweet side if you are not expecting, the fish was just a little bit undercooked for my mom, but it was a good combination with warm potato salad!  -Pineapple cake/pie (?) - if you like sweet, definitely worth the wait to have this warm dessert.   Yay for a piece of birthday chocolate cake with a little candle :-)  Our server was very attentive but somehow not so knowledgable about the food, I was expecting that she could tell us a bit more than 'this is a thai basil sauce'... One reason to take off a star was that even though we made a reservation and showed up on time, we still had to wait for about 10 mins to be seated although no one was in front of us. Also, yes, the outdoor seating was great, I wish they could have laid out the seating with some more spaces, the chairs between tables are almost hitting together...  I wanna go back for some more calamari!!"}
{"text":"VIsited the Charleston location last summer. The place truly felt Hawaiian. Palm trees sway outside with the summer breeze. Along the side of the restaurant, the tiki toarches burn as they beacon you to the main door.   The interior, of course as you would expect, is Hawaiian - nothing particularty striking but I found the dining area to be dark. The diners - mostly older peeps - in keeping with the Hawaiian spirit even sport Hawaiian shirts.  Inside you'd really feel the Hawaiian hospitality. Everyone was nice and pleasant. :)   My cousin who is a line cook here hooked us up with some good stuff.  Appys: Wow everything looked tasty...and they were. Definitely try the Shrimp on a Stick with Wasabi Cocktail Sauce, Island Ahi Poke, and the Pork & Shrimp Lumpia is perfect. Wasn't very impressed with the Crisped Seafood Potstickers and the Wood Grilled Szechuan Spiced Baby Back Pork  Entree: Hibachi Style Grilled Salmon. Glilled to perfection and comes with a decent portion. And to compliment this meal was a bottle of B.R. Cohn \"Silver Label\" North Coast Cabernet Sauvignon 2003. $60/ bottle here, $19 at any BevMo. It was  recommended by the sommelier and it was a perfect match. ...and she was nice enough to come by and offer another bottle after me and my cousin guzzle it like milk.  Dessert: This was my favorite. Everything was served a la mode. Definitely try the Melting Hot Chocolate Souffl, The Caramel Macadamia Nut Almond Tart with Vanilla Bean ice cream was interesting and the macadamia carrot cake with a sour cream maple glaze was wonderful."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food. For starters the calamari was tender and tasty, not overcooked as in many places.  For the main, we had the Ono fish, flown in daily from Hawaii as well as the butterfish.  Both were great as was the s'more -type dessert."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. Reservations was easy, and finding the place was easy as well."}
{"text":"My son's wedding rehearsal was at Roy's.  The service and food was wonderful, but they went above and beyond our expectations.  The special touches were appreciated - framed photo of the bride and groom with dessert, ring bearer's dessert with his name in chocolate, printed menu souvenirs for parents and grandparents, house made sorbets for guest with nut allergy, and delicious vegetarian entrée.  Many of our guests had nice comments about Roy's. One guest took pictures of the food to send to her parents who are planning a trip to Vegas next month.  Kathryn Koenigsberg, Group Sales Manager, communicated promptly, always organized and pleasant, and had great suggestions.  I would definitely recommend Roy's for an event and will return on trips to Vegas."}
{"text":"We went to Roy's to use our $25 dining credit and before we ordered we asked if we spend the pre-requisite  $50 even if it was for happy hour items can we apply the dining credit and the server said yes. But he didn't seem familiar with the promotion. We had a good meal at the bar, the bartender was pleasant but when we wanted to use our dining credit, the same server said we can't use it. I looked him straight in the eye and said, i specifically asked you about happy hour and you said yes. He called the manager over and he let us but explained that happy hour would be considered to be promotion but they'll honor it this time. Suggestions to mgmt: train your people on what you offer or all of the money you spent on marketing just went to waste and be very specific on what's excluded when you have a promotion."}
{"text":"I've only been here for their happy hour, but it's a really good one, and one of the few for upscale restaurants around town.  If I remember correctly, pretty much everything on the HH menu was $5, so quite a deal for this place.  Portions are HH sized, but the drinks and wine on selection were quite nice.  The sliders were really good, and so was the calamari.  Nice and attentive servers even though there was a large party going on in the bar too.  Another nice thing was the head chef was walking around talking to people, made me feel comfortable."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I had the fish sampler and all three were fantastic!  Great service, nice ambiance and good wine list.  Hubby loved it too. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Here is very clean and mood is so nice. Good place for your special day or events. Waiter's service is the best. I tried hawaiian food for the first time here and  their food was looked so good and very tastey as well, but the amount was small and a bit expensive. Also, there's a bar inside the romantic restaurant."}
{"text":"Food and service are always excellent. We probably come here once a month for Aloha Hour and for special occasion dining and have never been disappointed. Our favorites are the Rib Eye and Monkfish."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in town. Fresh seafood and a great atmosphere at the JW. If weather permits, sit outside on the beautiful patio."}
{"text":"The food was interesting, creative in its presentation. A little expensive for something I could have made at home...but then I'm a great cook. The service was a little slow, the portions small but then that's that kind of cuisine. The Ahi Poke had an excellent sesame dressing but what they over did was the cracked pepper....way toooooo much. Of course, I ate it all with little problem.  My final gripe, the waitress was a little too pushy on desserts by asking us many many times in many different ways if we wanted dessert! Other than that, our company was good and it was nice to get out of the house. Will I go back? Probably but not something I will be rushing to do. Las Vegas has many great places to eat where the portions and price are a little better and the food is superior."}
{"text":"I love Roy's! This restaurant has great fish and steak as well as an extensive wine list. I was also REALLY excited to see that they have an entire gluten-free menu! GO ROY'S!!! I've been to this restaurant a few times and I have always been extremely impressed with their servers and hostesses. Roy's is a place I go on a night I'm looking to celebrate something and enjoy a nice time with friends or family."}
{"text":"This place is totally great. A bit off the Strip but for a local like me I actually kinda like going to it and not having to be on the Strip. The service was amazing, waiters were friendly and knowledgable and patient with your selection. I would steer clear from ordering sushi here- not recommended because its pricey and not that good compared to if you go to a real sushi place.  I ordered the sampler plate and every piece on that dish was exceptional. For the dessert, the molten lava cake was to die for and probably one of the best desserts I've had."}
{"text":"I rarely have dressy clothes with me when I go to Las Vegas.  I'm not into the shows, and I tend to avoid the higher-end dining \"experiences\" except for the occasional casino steakhouse with friends.   So when some circumstances had me going from a business trip straight to my Vegas getaway, I decided to splurge.   And I really wanted seafood, and I really wanted to eat off strip.  I've been to Roy's in Chicago and enjoyed it, and saw that their Flamingo locaiton was rated #1 for all Vegas restaurants on another site.  That seemed a bit odd, but I figured I'd go for it.   Plus they use OpenTable, and I could get in sufficiently late after the dinner rush to be able to relax.  The location is easy to find, the place had cleared out, and the valet let me park my own car.  In fact, they weren't that busy, which made me wonder why there were no times available between 6:30-8pm on OpenTable.  Maybe because I was a party of 1.  Next time, I'd probably call.  The food and service were both outstanding.  The server handled checking my allergies against the menu extremely courteously and efficiently.  I ordered three courses - a tiger prawn appetizer, a fuji apple salad, and a butterfish.   The apple salad might be the best thing I've eaten in a month - the chef had juxtaposed curry spices against the apple and greens for a delicious taste.  My butterfish was excellent as well, delicate and full of flavor.  Three courses plus a glass of white wine was $85 after tip.  Definitely a splurge, but the service was outstanding and I was really able to relax after a long day (I'd started at 5am Pacific, had a morning meeting, and flown in after lunch) and the food was worthing of savoring.  The place is on the small side, and I'm not sure I'd feel the same luxurious pace on a Friday or Saturday night at 7pm, but I'll definitely keep Roy's in mind the next time I'm out here with friends who want to go for seafood."}
{"text":"In a few words, good service; very disappointing dinner. We were staying at the Desert Ridge for a few days and were excited to dine at Roy's on our last night. Unfortunately as it turned out our waiter (whose name I sadly can't remember) was the only good part of our experience. We sat outside, which was lovely except for the birds everywhere. Not the restaurant's fault, so I'll overlook it. My boyfriend ordered the spicy Ahi sushi roll as an appetizer. It was a pretty presentation (after a considerable wait) but he said he has better sushi from Stop and Shop, and the worst part was the wasabi (\"too bland\"). Again, I'd be willing to let that slide, if not for the rest of our meal. We ordered our steaks medium and medium well, and ended up waiting close to a half hour after the sushi for them (even though the restaurant was only about half full on a Tuesday evening). Turns out, it's because they were being overcooked. Both steaks came out well done with charred exteriors, and were very small portions. The asparagus was overcooked and limp. The poblano mashed potatoes was a good dish, but again, a very, very small portion (hardly more than a couple mouthfuls). We are not ones to complain and told the waiter that everything was fine when he asked, as making a complaint would have meant sending both entrees back and we were starving and didn't want to wait another half hour. The menu is ridiculously overpriced for the serving sizes one receives. I would never complain about that (we were on vacation and expected to pay extra for everything) but it just wasn't good food or enough food, and that's the problem. I could pay $30 at our local Chili's for two people to get overcooked steaks, but I expect more from a higher end restaurant that charges an arm and a leg. I shouldn't have to complain to get the steak we ordered, and I shouldn't have to leave still hungry. We went back to our rooms very disappointed on our last night :("}
{"text":"7PM reservation on a Saturday night for four. Restaurant about 3/4 full. Seated on time. Ordered drinks and  appetizers which arrived fairly quickly. The appetizers were very good and we looked forward to our main courses.   We waited almost an hour for our entrees. No explanation given. I had the Jade Pesto Mahi Mahi. Dry, tasteless. I had starting eating it and was trying to figure out why it had no flavor or moisture when I realized there was no pesto sauce, just a piece of grilled fish. No hint of basil, garlic, pine nuts or olive oil. Did they forget? Or is that their bizarre interpretation? Another member of our party had the Shellfish Sampler for which Roy's is famous. Equally flavorless. A third the Trio. Same. Roy's used to be known for its fish. Only the Surf and Turf that the fourth member of our party ordered had some flavor. I ordered a second, different glass of wine and was brought the same as the first.  At the next table a patron was complaining about her entree and insisted on a replacement. Maybe we should have done the same but we had already been there an hour and a half.  We finished appetizers and the main course and paid our bill by 9. Two hours for an unsatisfying meal with a bill of $250+ for four. We have eaten at this Roy's before and the one that used to be at Indian Bend and Scottsdale Road. Our memories were of much better meals of much better value than this. Won't be back anytime soon to this or any other Roy's."}
{"text":"Roy's is definitely one restaurant worth leaving the strip for!  I recently celebrated my early retirement with a few friends and was treated like \"ohana\" (family).  To start, we were handed menus printed with my name and retirement date. The food was \"onolicious\" as usual. The service was friendly and efficient as always.  I received a snapshot and frame of us enjoying a complimentary dessert.  Lastly, we were given discount gift cards for future visits!    I visited various Roy's in other states and knew about the printed menus but the other additions were unexpected and most appreciated!  When I visit Vegas, I typically stay on the strip but this restaurant was definitely worth traveling for."}
{"text":"The Happy Hour prices here are great - $5 each.  The Tempura Spicy Tuna Rolls are the bomb.  Wine selection is just \"meh\".  Good drinks on Happy Hour.  The service was just so/so.  Definitely a \"chain\" restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for my friend's wedding ceremony. I had outstanding experience there. Food, service and stomophere was all great. I would go back again when I visit Las Vegas. I can't forget the time I spend there."}
{"text":"Roy's serves Hawaiian Fusion, which is always an interesting combination of flavors.  I had the pleasure of trying the ahi tuna, the salmon, the butter fish, and the short ribs, each of them distinctly different, and each of them excellent.    The service was fabulous: the wait staff was knowledgeable, fast and quite pleasant.  My water glass was never empty (despite me being a generally thirsty person).  And despite being rather busy, my server kept things moving quickly and smoothly.  If you're looking for a great place to take a date, or just a nice place to have a GREAT meal, visit Roy's."}
{"text":"The service here is absolutely fantastic. Great wine pairing with the entrees.  The other trait I love about this restaurant is the time they give you to enjoy each course. We had appetizers, entrees, and dessert. For the 3 course meal it was about an hour and a half. I didn't feel like we were being herded in and out of a restaurant for quick turnover. We were allowed to enjoy our meal.  We did go for a birthday and I'll just say that the restaurant does something special other than a complimentary dessert. I won't ruin the surprise though.  The food itself is impeccable. The flavor was perfect and the everything was fresh. The braised beef peels apart with the touch of your fork and the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi isn't overly fried. The soufflé implodes as you poke it.   There's two reasons why I gave this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5. The first being as great as the meats were prepared, the veggies were undercooked and the rice was overcooked. Second, as gourmet as the food is, the atmosphere feels like I am in a Fox Concept Restaurant.   Other than that I highly recommend Roy's for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Roy's is one of the best off-strip restaurants in Vegas. The butterfish is my favorite menu item. There are parts of the menu that change every three months which is really nice. They also have an email club you can sign up for and they will notify you when the seasonal menu has changed and sometimes they send you $20 coupons. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Duckhorn Wine tasting dinner last night. If you've never experienced this at Roy's you should! It is not only a great way to experience great wines and learn about them, you also experience many different dishes that you normally would not. From the appetizer to the desert everything was well prepared and beautifully displayed on the plate. Met some wonderful people and just an enjoyable evening. Thanks Chris Korom and Chef Leong Yam for the wonderful experience!  See you soon"}
{"text":"Best local Hawaiian style food!!! Ono Ahi Poke and chocolate soufflé or pineapple upside down cake."}
{"text":"In our quest to try restaurants off the Strip (and satisfy the wife's request for seafood) we went to Roy's while we were in town for the PBR finals last week. We relied upon our waiter for drink, appetizer, and dessert selections and everything was excellent. Wife had the tuna and I went for the macademia crusted mahi. If you've been to Hawaii you know this is a staple of hawaiian restaurants, and i have to say that Roy's is one of the best I have had. The coating is not overwhelming and the fish was cooked to perfection. We had the green beans with crispy pork as a side and that wad delicious and unique.  Pineapple upside down cake with macadamia ice cream for dessert. So next time you're in Vegas and looking to escape hotel cuisine give Roy's a try--you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Before I knew anything about Roy's, we dined at the Kauai restaurant on our honeymoon years ago. Since then, we have frequented Roy's at this location maybe once a year or so, including a major wedding anniversary.   This place is not cheap--that's no surprise. Portions are not huge, but again, that's standard for this type of restaurant. I LOVE Roy's. It's a special occasion place for us (though their happy hour seems very enticing).   The appetizer sampler for 2 is oh-my-freakin-goodness amazing. It really does just leave you wanting more. And, though nothing too far out of the box, the butterfish is something I crave on a regular basis. So succulent, so delicious. Mouth is watering as I type.   On top of the lovely food, we have always had outstanding, personalized service. Especially if you have a specialty occasion, Roy's goes out of their way to take the experience to the next level. This location in the J.W. Marriott has an elegant atmosphere that lends itself towards after-dinner strolls in a sophisticated environment.   Oh, and did I mention that the martinis are well-made and scrumptious? (The 1988 is my absolute favorite!) Now I just need to check them out at the happy hour price!"}
{"text":"Roy's always delivers great food, but this location did not deliver good customer service.  It was a Monday night (not too busy) and our server Nicole let us wait nearly 20 minutes before taking our orders.  I had to notify the receptionist that we've been waiting for our server to come back, but she was nowhere to be seen.  Once I told them about that she immediately showed up and took our orders.  But it didn't stop there.  Drink refills were not checked and one of my guests never got a fork.  The one thing saving me from getting up again to find a manager was that I was among friends and we were having a wonderful conversation.  I would rate the food five stars, but the lack of service knocked the overall experience to three stars.  For such a nice restaurant with great food, I expect much better (and prompt) service."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. GREAT service, wait staff was very attentive and extra friendly, made the meal even better. Had the classic sampler with ahi, salmon, mahi mahi and butterfish, upgrade white rice to the black sticky rice, excellent. Prices were ok but try Aloha Hour from 4:30 to 6:30. $5 appetizers and drinks, great value if you want a light dinner and a drink. Carmel macadamia tart for desert was delicious."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants when we visit AZ service was outstanding, no wait for our table, the hostess took our picture and gave us a copy thought that was nice.  I had the prixe fixe meal which you can never go wrong with."}
{"text":"I've been to three Roy's now, here and two in Hawaii.  I always try to check out a new one when I come across them.  Excellent and interesting food. I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Had my brothers bar mitzvah here, as of what I've hear it sounds amazing... The salmon and short ribs are a must have."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to Roy's several times, and we usually go for a combination of the food and ambiance/service. Tonight, though the food was good, we were sorely disappointed with the latter.   Our server did not smile once throughout the entire dinner, and he frequently seemed annoyed with us. I don't ask that servers are constantly cheerful, but this particular waiter's demeanor was sour enough to cast a cloud over the whole experience. He would ask the requisite questions, but always with a disdainful look on his face. He also seemed irritated that we didn't order any drinks, and he all but snatched our wine glasses away.   Specifically, a few other things stand out among the general attitude of displeasure he displayed. We ordered the mango streusel dessert (from the prix fixe menu), and he brought out a pineapple dish and called it \"apple pecan... eh... thing.\" We didn't realize it was the wrong dessert until we dug into it, so we didn't say anything. Then, when it was time to pay, we wanted to use two gift cards plus a credit card to cover his tip. We had some confusion about how to do this, and he seemed really impatient when we asked questions. Then, when we said we would think about how we wanted to split things up, he backed away with his hands up and stomped away. Lastly, when we had paid and wanted to double check that we had properly written everything out on the receipt, he just snapped, \"That's fine.\" Again, I didn't expect him to fawn over us, but considering that we were trying to tip him (generously, might I add, given his rudeness throughout the night), he could have shown a little patience or at least said thank you.   I want to give the server the benefit of the doubt and assume that he was having a bad day, but it's really a shame that the good food and atmosphere were tainted by his unpleasant behavior. Next time my family wants to enjoy a nice dinner, we will probably choose a restaurant where we can expect a server who doesn't sneer at us.  ***  Edit: The manager saw my original review (above) and called to get more feedback. This impressed me and showed that Roy's really cares about its customers, and Emiliano was nothing but courteous and understanding when I spoke with him. He even sent a $50 certificate for our next visit. I really appreciate that he reached out and will be sure to try Roy's again soon."}
{"text":"Roy's is amazing! My husband and I have been here twice, each time celebrating a special occasion. Roy's made each celebration for us truly special by printing out a congratulations message and placing it in our menus. Every staff member acknowledging our special occasion. They even provided us with a free picture and a delicious dessert. The food is wonderful! My husband and I went to Hawaii for our honeymoon. My husband is not a fish person but when we went to Hawaii he loved the fish there. When we went to Roy's my husband fell in love with the fish there. It reminds us both of being back in Hawaii. The fish is melt in your mouth delicious. You will leave satisfied and smiling after dining at Roy's!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, Fabulous, Delicious.....Yummy!  Went with friends for a birthday and can't say enough \"good\" about food, atmosphere, service!  A definite \"must experience\" venue!"}
{"text":"i'm a huge fan of Roy's and have eaten at several locations throughtout the US. Went to the chandler location for fathers day had gift cards to use so started at the bar with the $5 happy hour menu and drinks. the Hawaiian Martini is great and wonderful choices on the food side we had spicy tuna roll. ..preceded to the dining room for dinner and did the spring prix fix for $39 each salad, entree and dessert. we shared the meals 2 salads 2 entrees had the fish and hanger steak. and both desserts. everything was good..service, pace of the dinner  & atmosphere. ..we had 1 small problem when the steak came out ice cold cook correctly but the plate also cold as the server placed it on the table saying extreemly hot be carefull ..once i was able to let the server know the problem they went into lets fix this mode. although we choose to take the steak to go the manager came over and gave us 2 $20 gift cards and then at the end of the meal took another $20 off the bill. nice job i'll be back and i recommend giving them a try..hawaiian fused food in AZ makes u want to hope a plane for MAui..."}
{"text":"Wow, for some reason i walked into the restaurant thinking that I would be giving a four star review. So even more impressed that they won me over recieving 5 stars.  The restaurant is as described hawain fusion.  Amazing Fish dishes combined with american staples like a pork chop or filet.  I chose a Fish sampler. I would Always take three mini entrees over 1 large entre any day. All three pieces of Fish were Cooked diferently and perfectly.   The best part of the night was the service. I could tell the Server was new and nervice. Learned later that he recently worked his way up though the ranks. He stumbled with the wine work. At first in was like \"i can't believe he can't open a bottle of wine\". But he quickly demonstrated humility and was forthcoming with his lack of experience opening wine. I quickly went from criticing to cheering for the guy. During the entire meal our server went above and beyond. The restaurant manager checked in yet did not smother.   There was an above average amount of specialty drinks. Wine list had everything you needed with a nice range of prices. I Especially appreciated the options at the lower price points.   It was mentioned that today was a new menu so if you have not stopped in for a while now may be the time for a return visit."}
{"text":"I was so wanting to try something different and I think I wanted this place to be something special from reading the menu. So I only scanned the comments with blinders on and only read the good comments.  But now that were home and I re-read them I realize that almost everyone liked a few things and several things they didn't.  And for the prices they charged I would think everything should have been fantastic. Well the $100 it cost to eat there for just two entrees, one salad and one Arnold Palmer was an extreme bummer.  It truly was a waste of our hard earned money.  Since they don't post their prices on their website we thought we would give it a try just from the reviews.  Wrong!  If I knew we were going to spend that much money we could have gone to the Keg which was soooo much better than Roy's by far.  The short ribs or should I say two little ones had a burnt layer on top that, after chewing forever I still had to discretely put it in my napkin.  You would have thought for $30 dollars they could have given you more than 1/2 cup of running potatoes and few sprigs of asparagus and broccoli.  If the taste was as exquisite as the cost... maaaybe, but NO, total disappointment!  The medium rare prime rib was at best medium to well done and covered in a thicker like gravy juice, served with a tiny bowl of Mac N Cheese? Even the ranch dressing had no flavor compared to even Denny''s ... another disappointment. You might let it go by if you were at Steer and Stein.  But when you are going out for your anniversary and a very special time together and figure it's worth the splurge you can't help feel completely disappointed.  I so wish we could have gone somewhere else more worth it."}
{"text":"Celebrated our 2nd anniversary here. This was one of our best experiences yet! The food was amazing and the service was great. Anthony the food runner entertained us and made sure we were enjoying our visit. I highly recommend trying Roy's out. It's worth the extra money!!! Thank you Anthony for making our 2nd anniversary memmorable"}
{"text":"Had the grilled fish combo...it was amazing.  I also tried a friend's rib-eye steak.  It was cooked perfectly and all it should have been.  The fried rice was a great side to try as well.    We went with a big group and it was the perfect atmosphere for us.  The service was great.  I have been to other locations and had the same experience.  Love the food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very good experience. Came here for a wedding anniversary and they gave us free champaign, desserts, and printed a photo of us at the restaurant. Very good service. We got the course meal and it was great! We would recommend it for people wanting to celebrate."}
{"text":"A group of us went for a 50th birthday.  From the moment we walked in they made the birthday girl feel special.  From including a special page in the menu with her name and a birthday greeting to the fresh berries with \"happy birthday\" spelled out in chocolate at the end!  In addition, our waiter, Melvin, was amazing!  He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and everything he recommended we ordered and we loved all of it! He also recommended a very reasonable bottle of wine that was fantastic.  He gave us plenty of time, didn't rush us or hover but was very attentive.  This is not one of those trendy, overpriced, \"hip\" vegas restaurants so if that is your scene, you may be disappointed.  However, if you want really good food and excellent service for a reasonable price then I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"For $30-40 per entree, you can do far better.  The macadamia crusted mahi mahi is bland as sand with nothing to compliment it but blander potatoes and a few sprigs of asparagus.  Surf n turf boasted a decent filet but an extremely petite lobster tail, with a purée of something between the two that starts out bland but finishes like black pepper.  Waiter forgot my wife's glass of wine despite knowing this was a wedding anniversary dinner for us.  Made zero effort to make it right.  Dessert was only saving grace.  We will certainly look elsewhere for fine (or even moderate) dining."}
{"text":"Just went to here to have birthday dinner. It we a quiet Monday eve late parking lot not full. We didn't have a reservation and we're treated like that was not acceptable but they would try to fit us in, it would be a few minutes. We watched at least three parties leave and one go in while we waited over 30 minutes with no communication from the staff. Very rude! Will not go back. We went across the way to Z'tejas and we're taken right in. The food at Z'Tejas  was great and we had very good service!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing... They serve me sake wine glass! Dinner was mediocre probably equivalent to a low-priced Chinese restaurant... And probably not as good... it's our second time there but it will be our last...... I think the chef should pay more attention to what's going on."}
{"text":"Just finished the meal.  Overpriced, cold food, and very slow service.  Ordered lobster bisque.  Great taste butI I have more lint in my navel than I found lobster in my soup.  I had 4 average scallops for $35  and it was served at room temperature.   Sent it back  and they returned the same scallops back to me slightly warmed.  Very small portions of house wine at $15 a glass.   They offered a free desert but I refused.  Enough punishment for one night.  My wife had an equally cold fish dish for $40.  Save the money and go to McDonalds for a Filet of Fish"}
{"text":"This Roy's is not what it used to be. Over the last 13 years I have eaten here 7 times, always consistent until now. Something is fundamentally wrong with this location. I have been to over 15 Roy's across the country and Hawaii and up until now they have always been consistent.  First, let me say the location and ambience is amazing, you feel like you are in Hawaii. Yes, the servers are all amazing.  My issue is with the drinks.  My favorite is the Hawaiian martini which did not taste anything close to what it should. I complained and they made another one but they  said it's all the same batch and of course it tasted just as bad. I then ordered an old standby at usually served at nice restaurants, a Manhattan up. It came out looking so dark and nothing like a Manhattan. Once I tasted it, I was correct, it tasted like all vermouth, no hint of bourbon. Who doesn't know how to make a Manhattan???? Apparently Roy's at Desert Ridge. I sent it back and got an old fashion which very tasty.  The food was good but the drinks ruined the evening.  After spending $200+ on the meal, I expect more. Roy's Desert Ridge is not on there game. I miss the days with Bob Mayo being managing partner, this would not have happened.  I truly hope they can turn around and not suffer the fate of closing like other Roy's across the country."}
{"text":"So let me start by telling you about the service.  My husband and I placed our order and waited for 30 minutes before the food came out.  Okay the food tasted fantastic so it was definitely worth the wait.  Now for the unbelievable part we did not see our waiter again.  Nope another 30 minutes went by and we were finished eating thinking well that was great but I sure could use a refill on my tea.  I literally had to grab this young kid  and ask him if we could get a refill.  Then we sat there for about 20 minutes looking around for our waiter.  I finally grabbed this guy that looked like he might be in charge and told him we would like our check and that we hadn't seen our waiter since we placed our order!  He went and got him and low and behold he came to our table with our check.  No apology just left the check and off he went.  Really??  I was fit to be tied to say the least!  Our bill was $121 we did not leave a tip!  I will NEVER go back there again!"}
{"text":"We went to check this place out for Restaurant Week, when they had a three course prix fixe menu for $40.13 with a portion being donated to charity. We had checked out the menu online but when we arrived, at least one option that was listed online (for restaurant week) was not listed. I asked the waiter and he asked the chef. They said it would be no problem, and I was thrilled since that was the reason I had wanted to try Roy's out in the first place.   Service was a tiny bit slower than we are used to but I felt very well taken care of despite it being slow, plus it gave us time to just sit back and enjoy the evening. Everything we tried was amazing. Highlights of the evening: lobster pot stickers, misoyaki butterfish, and the chocolate soufflé ... Omg so delicious. I'm getting hungry again just thinking of it. I will definitely return in the near future."}
{"text":"My server Angie was the best! Shout out to her for always checking to see if our table was doing fine! As for the food, it was alright. Wasn't a fan of the pan-roasted chicken, but the salmon was good ."}
{"text":"I recently celebrated a special occasion at this location; what a spectacular experience!!!  From the moment we stepped in until the time we left the attention to detail was incredible.  The food was excellent; absolutely try the butterfish.   A friend of mine told me about it....so glad I did.  Cocktails were good and the celebration dessert was tasty.  What made the most of this experience was the little details.  The staff being aware and acknowledging the occasion plus the Manager thanking us for choosing to celebrate with them.  There is more but the rest of the details I will spare....just in case you choose to celebrate with them.  I wouldn't want to ruin all the surprises.  The day was already awesome but this experience was icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"AHHHHH... yeah I love this place. Could it be the monster fish tank they have when you first walk in that will mesmorize your kids throughout the whole dinner or the fabulous food? I have been here twice and from start to finish I was smiling. Their signature edamame made me look up the recipie as soon as I got home. My favorite is their \"$35\" combo.. which includes an appetizer, meal, and dessert.  Slammin deal for a restaurant with white table cloths! I had the grilled salmon which was perfect and the chocolate souffle (A MUST!). Your water glass will never be more than half empty, nor will there ever be crumbs on your table for more than five minutes... yes I like being treated like royalty.. :-D GO ROY's!"}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite places to go! I have been to several Roy's here and in Las Vegas. I have never been disappointed in the service, atmosphere or the food.   This particular visit we had reservations for 8:30 and part of our group did not even arrive at our house until 9:00. The staff was very accommodating with the shift of our arrival time.   The food is to die for. I have enjoyed everything I have ordered. My favorites are the lobster pot stickers, calamari, and the chocolate souffle.   Roy's has their own cookbook and I would highly recommend purchasing it. Most of the recipes are relatively easy to make.   This is a great place to go for special events. We have been with small groups and large. The service is always spectacular!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional. Love the food, service, ambiance. Roy's is hard to beat. Never a bad experience. Try the butterfish, you won't be sorry. And you can never go wrong with the chocolate soufle."}
{"text":"We went early for Aloha hour with intentions to move to the dining area for dinner but never did. Husband and I ordered ahi tuna roll and lobster pot stickers to start. The ahi tuna roll was so good we ordered another. The drinks were good. We talked with the friendly bartender and another couple at the bar. We were having such a good time that we never moved but we were too full for dinner after the appetizers."}
{"text":"Down hill. Unfortunately this once favorite place of my wife and I has succumbed to poor moral and poor quality. Roys was purchased by another company and nothing changed initially. Fast forward to June and suddenly the chef creations and pastry chef innovations of deserts were not available. A streamlined menu is limited and the quality has taken a hit."}
{"text":"Exceptional service from our server Eric, including for my toddler aged child.  The portions were a good size and the child's entree came with an appetizer and dessert. I never had to wait for a drink refill and the staff was extremely attentive. The food was great, but expect to spend around $13 for an item off the child's menu and about $30 for the average entree. The pineapple upside down cake was awesome."}
{"text":"It was a littler dark inside, quiet, and our server was just okay maybe she just wanted to go enjoy her weekend but -if she has the same personality she did with us, I'm sure her plans were NOT amazing. Anways- started with the calamari and it was delicious.  This red sauce they have is really spicy and sweet at the same time and we asked for another serving of it.  The server told me she could write down the recipe but I told her no need- I am far too lazy to actually \"try\" and recreate it.  But the thought was nice.  I ordered this macadamia crusted mahi-mahi.  My dish came sitting on top of some mashed potatoes with 3 sticks of asparagus and 6 chopped slices of red potato.  I thought my dish was filling also.  bill was $99 bucks total with each of us getting one alcoholic beverage.  If i do return it will be for the calamari only."}
{"text":"Really enjoy coming to this place. They make every occasion special. Reminds me of being in Hawaii. Love it."}
{"text":"Joined a friend and her son for their annual Easter dinner at Roy's. Our first visit but we primarily accepted the invite due to the company. Food is maritime Hawaiian pacific centric with the occasional token beef dishes of mignon or the ever AZ popular short rib dish that's graces most menus.  I'd give it an extra 1/2 star for our patio seating where you are surrounded by the lush Marriott greens and tiki lighting.  We all went for seafood as evidenced by our photos and nothing spectacular but again we are beggars in the desert. Price point is resort average so sans liquor is say roughly $100 pp with decent appetizers. So so desserts as what arrived was an overhyped molten lava cake billed as a delicate soufflé. Ahhh can't wait to return and indulge at my fave Le Soufflé in ??? in a couple weeks, the pinnacle of soufflé greatness...but I digress :)  Anyway back to the Marriott, I'd go back and check in on a weekend just for the lazy river pool before it gets scorching at night!"}
{"text":"Roy's Hawaiian Fusion is one of the best experiences I've ever had at a restaurant.  The food was excellent.  Some of the best food I've ever eaten. Take time to experience a full course meal here including appetizer and dessert. Ask the server what is good for the day as well and they'll be honest and tell you what is being done well that day.  The atmosphere is very laid back and the service was excellent. Roy's is going to the very top of my favorite restaurants list. I hope the other locations are just as good."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here.  I heard so much about this place.  It took 2 hrs to get our food.  I got the trio.  Not impressed.  Only liked one of them.  The only reason they get one star is because of our waitress.  I would love to give it a second shot, but let's just say that after tonight, Roy's left a bad taste in my mouth.  Ok, giving one more star because the head chef came by and apologized. Appreciate the gesture but still does not make it right."}
{"text":"Service is good but a very old/bad glass of wine, prices are up and portion was down on the Butterfish dish.  Very disappointed, don't think I will return again."}
{"text":"We celebrated a late Valentine's Day, and the food was excellent. The first time we visited and the service was exemplary. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Food was okay, service was bizarre. Numerous people swarming the table to retrieve plates and cutlery, infrequent visits by our server. Our server was completely disinterested. We ordered an appetizer, two salads and two entrees. Appetizer never came and the waitress never mentioned it. When she finally appeared we were almost finished with our entrees, I told her to disregard bringing the appetizer. She blew it off in such a weird way that I asked my husband if she heard me. He assured me that she had because she mumbled something about being sorry and then went on to talking about desserts. Very strange. It took forever to bring the check even after we asked for it twice. The food was good but not great. The lobster meat was so small it looked like a scallop and the salads were a joke. Not going back. Overrated just like the hotel itself."}
{"text":"Very nice decor.  Excellent service.  Loved the sweet home salad.  The lobster potstickers were very good too.  But I didn't really care for their signature entree known as butterfish.  It's actually black cod which is well known to be a rich oily filet.  Many folks might like this more heavy texture but I prefer I light flaky fish myself so I didn't really enjoy this meal.  Everything else about the meal was great so I should have probably ordered the halibut or steelhead."}
{"text":"This is the first time I was visiting this particular Roys, since my usual location is SF. I made this reservation for a party of 7 including children (i wasnt sure about a kid's menu etc) and was happily surprised with the awesome service we received. They do in fact have a kid's menu and cater to younger guests. This started with a complimentaty plate with an appetizer and veggies for my  3 nephews along with a paper Chef hat. Then as usual, they try to make the visit special by asking if you are celebrating something special etc, and the kids loved seeing their names on their dessert plates. Besides these nice details and a really great table (felt like a private dining experience), they also took a picture so we could take it home. I must say I was expecting great service from Roys as usual and was not dissapointed at all. Will definetely be visiting this location again when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was great, lobster potstickers yummy but the macadamia nut mahi mahi was a total disappointment. Overlooked but maybe it tasted that way bc it had been frozen. Promised with rice it arrived balanced on 4 cut potatoes. Sauce was a repeat of the lobster. Not like I remembered on Kauai."}
{"text":"We ate there during our family vacation.  The experience was great for the whole family.  Our meal was fantastic, swordfish and sea bass.  Our kids, 7 & 10, were taken care of from the time we came in.  They got special glasses, an appetizer plate of quesadillas, apples, and veggies as soon as the drinks came out, and a personalized sundae for dessert."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Roy's last night. It was amazing, probably one of the best meals I've had at a restaurant. I had the blackened ahi tuna and ordered the bacon mac and cheese. For dessert we had the lava cake. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad to give this review but truth be told Aloha hour sucked. Roy's has declined in quality . I'm sorry I did not take pictures. The only thing I enjoyed was the kimchi ,that's on the dinner menu. Service is a solid 5 stars but I come for the food. Nothing on the new AH menu is right. What happened to Roy's?"}
{"text":"My partner and I came here for my birthday dinner on Monday evening and I couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Everyone from the greeters to the food runners were exceptionally polite and kind. Our waiter was VERY knowledgable on the menu and made some amazing recommendations.  The restaurant itself is gorgeous. The food presentation is top notch, not to mention the spectatular quality of the food.  I will definitely be returning here as often as possible!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience. The food was great. The server was very attentive. The atmosphere was very relaxed and quite romantic."}
{"text":"I found myself sadly disappointed with Roy's.  The hotel and restaurant are beautiful and the service was very attentive.  I ordered the Mahi Mahi, which I was told is one of the signature dishes.  When it arrived, both my friend and I (who ordered the same thing) looked at ourselves while we chewed and had the same reaction...WTF!  We felt like we were eating the tablecloth.  It truly had zero flavor.  Luckily, a Manager was walking around greeting everyone, and when he asked how the food was, we couldn't hide our disappointment.  I seriously consider that they may have forgotten an ingredient??  They offered us spicy mustard to add some taste....  I don't consider myself a picky eater, and I love seafood.  The Manager did end up comping the dish, which was appreciated.  The drinks were tasty but pricey which is expected for the setting.  I'd love to say I'd give them another shot as I've heard good things but not likely."}
{"text":"My wife and I have wanted to try Roy's since we moved to Ahwatukee. We're glad we finally made it there because the food was absolutely wonderful.  We called ahead for a reservation and were seated right on time. Our server was very prompt, and took a moment to go over the menu since we were \"first timers\". We started with the lobster potstickers. They were fantastic. Substantial lobster filling and light enough to leave room for our entrees. I was struggling with what to order so our server told us the chef could do a split plate with two entrees. It was the perfect solution, and very unique compared to other restaurants.   I had the blackened ahi and the prosciutto wrapped ono. Both were perfectly cooked. The ahi was spicier than I had anticipated, but very flavorful with great texture. The Ono was the better of the two dishes. Light with a great buttery flavor, and the prosciutto didn't overpower the flavor of the fish. My wife had the scallops. There were four large diver scallops in the order. The had a wonderful crispy sear, but were perfectly cooked and moist. The sauce was very savory as well with great flavor.   We finished with the chocolate soufflé. it was very light, but rich at the same time. Word to the wise, pre order this if you're thinking about it for dessert. Ours came about 10 minutes after we finished our entrees because we pre ordered. A couple next to us didn't, and they were waiting for theirs even though they finished their entrees before we did.   Overall a great experience and we'll definitely go back. We'd love to make it in time for the happy hour and try some of the appetizer and cocktail specials."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here. Food is mediocre and service poor. Staff unfriendly. Way better options for seafood and \"pacific rim\" cuisine."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped by for the first time to have happy hour drinks and appetizers.  Upon walking in the door we were greeted by the host and manager. The staff was so friendly and attentive. The happy hour appeitizers we ordered, the wagyu beef sliders, crunchy golden lobster potstickers, and tempura crusted spicy ahi roll, were so delicious and the presentation of the food was just beautiful! The happy hour menu is very limited for the 6 dollars but it was still hard to choose because it all sounds wonderful. We just loved the vibe of the atmosphere and look forward to our next visit because we want to try the beef short rib tacos! Thank you for such a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"The edamame snack put in the middle of our table was the highlight of the visit.  My signature pineapple martini was great, but there were no prices on the specialty drink menu.  What was up with that?  Everything was trying hard, but just so-so.  Extremely pricey and not even specials were offered because \"we change our menu every few months\".  Ohh-kay!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere.  One of the best meals out we've had in a long time. My husband and I both agreed that this was a memorable meal where they got everything right. (We eat out regularly, and this experience stood out from others.)  My husband is still talking about how incredible the steak he had was, days later. I really enjoyed the bento box and the chocolate souffle dessert.  The service was more attentive that I have seen anywhere else in a long time, which was nice because we were never left with an empty water glass etc.  Also, they do have special menus for people who have dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Aloha hour is the best! How can you beat $6 apps and drinks?! We had a feast. We got the wagyu sliders, beef skewers, calamari, and lobster potstickers while I sipped on a pomegranate mojito. The service was great, very friendly, fast and attentive. And nothing beats the views of the Desert Ridge Marriott!"}
{"text":"I seem to have perpetual Roy's amnesia.  I go, I love it, but then forget that it's a GREAT restaurant.  Then, I get some coupon in the mail, go back, and say \"F*&^, why don't I come here more often?\"  I NEED to come here more often because: Butterfish.  OMG, they do a great butterfish.  They also do a great blackened ahi.  Actually, in general, they do great fish.  It's always perfectly prepared and fresh tasting.  Much love to the Roy's chefs on that.  I generally stick to the fish but I have had the chocolate souffle.  The souffle is a lick-your-plate-clean kind of dish.  Warm, dark chocolate souffle topped with raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream.  What's not to like?  Service is generally fast and friendly and they give you free edamame. Yeah, it's a chain, but for what they do, they do it well.    P.S. - As of this date, free Hawaiian Martini with Yelp check-in."}
{"text":"Quality of food and service was excellent.  We didn't have a reservation but the manager was very accommodating. Service was second to none.  We had the trio of fish which was like something off master chef. We also had the trout which was really well cooked, full of flavor. Desert was amazing. We had the pineapple turnover and the chocolate fondant. Presentation of all the food was beautiful.  We had a really good night and the price was also reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"Food was very good and consistent with the other times we've eaten at Roy's in other cities. But the wait for the food took a LONG time! This restaurant is located inside the Marriott resort. Beautifully decorated with indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"One of the best places to dine!! My friend and I spent the day shopping and looking at hotels on the strip of Las Vegas. We stopped by Roy's and enjoyed the Aloha Happy Hour!!! The food was A-maxing!!! The lump crab fries rice; Ebi Roll; Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs and Lobster Potsticker were outstanding. And the Drinks!!! I can't find the words to diatribe the  Mai Tai and 1988 cocktails. This was the perfect end to a perfect vacation. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"i was always hesitant to go to asian-fusion restaraunts.  i think it's pretty damn good.  also, this is the only hawaiian fusion restaurant i know of.  the decor is beautiful.  you have a variety of places to eat...the bar, the open dining area, the counter area where you can view the cooking, and some private rooms.  i have to say the service has always been spectacular at this location whether i'm there for a big loud business presentation or a private dinner.  i love it when the wait staff put the napkins on you.  the poketini is probably the best thing on their menu.  this time i worked on the sweet and spicy wood grilled szechuan baby-back ribs.  that meat was tender, it came off the bone so easily that you can use a fork to remove it from the bone.  i also loved how my nose tickled from the the pungent spicy soy mustard butter on  the blackened ahi.  they even gave us toothpicks after the appetizer.  why?  probably to make sure that we dont have big chunks of dark meat in between our teeth while we're conversating for the rest of the dinner.  nice touch.   for some odd reason i always end up getting the Roasted Macadamia Nut Mahi Mahi.  i just love how light and moist that fish is and with the crunch for the roasted macadamia nut.  it doesnt have a lot of flavor, but that fish is so yummy.  for dessert i always enjoy the Melting Hot Chocolate Souffl.  i dont think i have to explain this one...it's hella gooey good!!!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite restaurants for atmosphere.    great food, great service.....  love love love the pomegranate mojito!  Awesome happy hour."}
{"text":"Service - 5 stars  Food - 4 stars   Atmosphere - 3 stars  We sat in the bar area. Pretty noisy but we are not to particular about that. Partly because we enjoyed the food so much that day. My boyfriend and I shared an appetizer and a 3 course meal. We started out w the lobster bisque. SO delicious! Creamy and the lobster tasted fresh. For the course we had a calamari salad. It was not greasy and had a ton of flavor. They didn't have a sauce probably because it wasn't necessary! For the main course we had the shredded pork and rice. I'm having it as leftovers 2 days later for lunch and it's still soOo good. So tender and it melts in your mouth. The rice was soft and fluffy and it came w a boiled egg that was fried or something. Just amazing. I'm not a big dessert person but we had the chocolate soufflé w ice cream. Pretty good and I'm assuming it was because my BF finished the whole plate. I will be back any times more if the food is consistent. Oh.. Almost forgot.. Tried their Mai Tai.. Again I'm not a fan of sweets and their Mai Tai was too sweet for my taste. The server said it was made all at once and offered to make me another one to my liking. He took it off my bill and was very nice about taking it back. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed when I eat at Roy's. The menu has pretty much been the same for years, as it should be, because it's perfect. If you have food allergies, they are probably the most accommodating of any place I've ever been to, which makes it all the more worth it. They have a huge drink menu as well, but the 1988 Martini is fantastic. Sit out on the patio if the weather's nice, it's very relaxing.  The appetizer canoe is the best way to start the meal: the Szechwan ribs, lobster pot stickers (from what I remember before I found out that I'm gluten intolerant) and the seared ahi are all awesome. From the entrees I've had over the years, I can say that they are all delightful. The sauces are what really make the dishes stand out, which is probably why Roy's is known for having really great sauces that compliment the dishes well. The molten hot chocolate souffle is to die for though. My family goes to Roy's only once a year for my parents' anniversary, and that souffle is what I look forward to all year. I just had it on Friday, and I already want another one.  The service is great too. Our waiter was very attentive to us and we had a great time."}
{"text":"This was the first Ro's I'd eaten at approximately 5 years ago. I worked in Las vegas often, once my boss and I were in town and planned to entertain customers. he asked me to choose a decent restaurant and make reservations. I looked in a magazine as well as checking online from my hotel room, the idea of\"Hawaiian Fusion\" intriqued me as I love asian food and polynesian culture. I earn major kudos from boss, his wife, and our clients that night and I make a point to dine at that oy's whenever I'm in LV, I also like the Roy's locations in southern Caifornia. All location serve fresh delicious dishes. I'm a sushi fan, their fish is great. The butter fish is my fave dish at Roy's. Service is very good, always treated with respect and hospitality."}
{"text":"I love eating at Roy's. The only problem I have is the price. It is a little on the pricey side. We usually walk out with almost a $150-200 bill when we go in. Absolute must haves; lobster potstickers, butterfish, 1988 and there is a sushi roll with steak and asparagus. Everything i have tried is great."}
{"text":"My husband and I first learned about Roy's when we celebrated our 5th anniversary on Kauai.  We were thrilled to learn that a new Roy's had opened up in Ahwatukee.  We celebrated our 12th anniversary at the new Roy's on Ray Rd and were just blown away with the wonderful food (artfully arranged on the plate, so it's a treat for the eyes as well as the tastebuds).  We tried a mojito that had pineapple and ginger in it that was delicious.  I had the swordfish and my husband ordered ono.  Both were fabulous.  We weren't going to order dessert, as I had made a special dessert at home, but the waitress brought us an adorable sampling of mini desserts to taste anyway.  It was a real delight to celebrate our anniversary at Roy's.  We'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to visit Roy's and enjoy a beautiful evening sitting outside.  Upon arriving we encountered one of the rudest hostesses we have ever met. The only person she was more rude to was the extremely helpful gentleman that was assisting us while we waited for her to come back to the hostess stand.  He was genuinely being helpful and she could not have been any more condescending and degrading to this poor young man.  When he walked us to our table I apologized to him for how SHE treated him.   The service at the table was good and the food was also good, but I would be very reluctant to visit this restaurant again based on the poor attitude of this individual."}
{"text":"Ambience, relaxing, quiet at first then the place got busy, louder but not too irritating. Decor, beautiful, modern Hawaiian. The food, well, I haven't had anything this good since I was in Maui last summer. I had an unlimited gift card so I tried MANY dishes. If you haven't tried Roy's before I suggest the many sampler plates, you will find a favorite! Mine is the Miso Butterfish, melts like butter in your mouth, with a flavor experience you have never had before! Less fusiony dish-The filet mignon is to die for! Service was sketchy, I had to refill my own sparkling water twice! We waited a long time  without a check in from our waiter in between orders!!! Hence, the 4 stars, not 5! Dishes were on small side so you will need an appetizer and dessert to be \"full.\" I would eat here again, especially if I'm not buying, it's a little pricey but great experience!"}
{"text":"oh.em.gee. the butterfish is to die for! i normally dont eat seafood, but this was so worth it! they are not exagerrating when they tell you it melts like butter in your mouth. its a must if you're dining at this restaurant! also, if you decide you want the chocolate souffle for dessert order it in advance because it takes about 20 minutes to make."}
{"text":"The best service, best seafood, and the best Hawaiian martini in the valley.  The Ono was prepared perfectly.  And the upside down pinnaple cake was a perfect conclusion.  Went on our anniversary and they even gave us another free dessert, took our picture, even framed it."}
{"text":"Went last night. Sadly disappointed.  Save your money.  Fish over done and dry.  See pictures of carrots.  Waste of $150 never again.  No wonder locations are closing.  Positive notes: server was great, pear salad awesome.  Manager doesn't like criticism.  Not accommodating"}
{"text":"Wow! This is an awesome seafood restaurant. The menu is limited yet the head chef likes to add and change featured flavored that are not on the menu. For example, the waiter told us we had 3 more options that the chef was cooking that evening that were Not on the menu. Most of their food is wild caught so if you are pregnant the menu has only a few options for you to enjoy. The restaurant is small and intimate. The kitchen is an open style so you can view the chefs at work. If you go you must try the calamari!... It's the best ever!"}
{"text":"We've had a GC since christmas and figured restaurant week was a good time to use it. We've never been to Roy's since we tend to stray from chains, but I have heard good things so it seemed promising.  We chose the following from the $50.11 Restaurant Week menu:  First Course Panko Crisped Calamari with Macadamia Nuts, Orange Chili Glaze & Yuzu Aioli and Wood Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs.   Second Course Shellfish Sampler; Butter Poached Half Lobster Tail, Seared Crab Cake, U10 Sea Scallop & Shrimp with Macadamia Nut Pesto Risotto and Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi with Maine Lobster Essence.   Third Course Mascarpone Cheesecake with Coconut Crust, Lemon Crème Anglaise & Blueberry Syrup and Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé with Raspberry Sauce & Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.  We both felt \"meh\" about the whole experience. Service was discombobulated, I made a reservation but they couldn't find it. They were slow to attend to us at first. We were also seriously distracted by the family behind us, they thought it was a good idea to keep their kiddo occupied by watching cartoons on an iPad. Fine if you have earphones, but not acceptable otherwise especially when average checks are $50 per person.  As for the meal, we enjoyed the edamame to start. It's such a great alternative to bread. Our appetizers were ok. The calamari was very tender, but there was a hint of seasoning I didn't care for it was sweet and bitter. My husband didn't mind it as much. The ribs had a nice char and good flavor, but they were tough and had too much gristle. The  shellfish sampler was terrible. All of it was overcooked, and the flavor was poor. Majority has hardly edible, and the risotto was no better. I definitely chose the better entree. It was overcooked, but otherwise I thought it was decently executed. Desserts didn't impress either. The souffle was chalky. The highlight was the ice cream. My cheesecake was passable, but I really only enjoyed the blueberry syrup.  Not the best way to kick off restaurant week, but on the other hand it set the bar pretty low. I feel like it can only get better."}
{"text":"The ahi roll was excellent. Aloha hour was the bomb. We had great food; recommend ahi roll, lobster potstickers and ribs. All was excellent. Drinks and Hawaiian beer was great."}
{"text":"It is very nice restaurant, very very friendly, even free the steak for longer waiting, stronger recommend"}
{"text":"Really excellent seafood restaurant with different menu choices than a standard seafood place.  The first time I was in a Roy's was in the mid 90's in Tokyo (now closed as far as I know) and really enjoyed it but never found another one at least any one I had time to get to.  Service was excellent, server was able to describe the dishes we had questions on and they were correct.  Overall very enjoyable evening and I will be looking for Roy's in more cities I visit."}
{"text":"Went for the \"Aloha\" hour.  After 9 very good prices in the bar area only. Got the Wagyu burger...It was fantastic..came with an egg on top. So good.  Sushi rolls were great too."}
{"text":"Love Roy's!!! They have such complex, flavorful food choices and beautiful presentation.  The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable about their menu items and can brief you on the unique menu items available at this location only.  It's a little pricey, but for a celebration or special occasion, the experience here is perfect.  Don't miss the chocolate souffle at the end!"}
{"text":"Visited the bar for happy hour.  Nice atmosphere.  You can get the happy hour at the bar, high-top tables, and the sushi bar.  There's a great selection of reasonably priced martinis, cocktails, beers and wine.  The $5 appetizers were tasty but they are smaller portions than the full priced appetizers."}
{"text":"My dad took my sister and I here for our college graduation night and they went above and beyond to make us feel special! They gave us a graduation desert that was decorated beautifully. As well as a $20 gift card and three printouts of a family photo they took of us. It was the best place to celebrate any big occasion! They made my sister and I feel like rock stars!"}
{"text":"Food, service & ambiance is never a disappointment. Is a little pricey but you get EXACTLY every pennies worth. I always look forward to the different menu items and the smiling faces."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been fans of Roy's since our first time at the flagship location on Oahu . . . and we've watched him expand to the mainland. Our experience with the mainland Roy's have been hit and miss, but the Marriott Desert Ridge location pretty much knocks it out of the park! We went at the tail end of Arizona Restaurant Week. We really liked the menu options for this special week, and the warm chocolate souffle cake is always out of this world . . . If that was the only thing that tasted good, then we would feel we got our money's worth . . . but we didn't have to worry about it because everything was perfect from beginning to end.  We had an adorable server who had a great personality and excellent people skills. She was unassuming and let us linger between courses. As I am a stickler about food coming out too soon after just finishing one course, this was just perfect! And so relaxing. The ambiance on the patio, which is where we chose to sit, almost felt as if we were on one of the islands, not in the middle of the desert . . . with the tiki torches lit and the sound of the babbling water features throughout the resort, it came pretty close . . . it was just missing the trade winds.  The resort had a band playing as well . . . they were pretty good, a few ups and downs. I would have loved if the music was a little more subtle than the pop-jazz mix they were playing . . . oh, but I have digressed.   My hubby and his daughter chose the restaurant week menu. Hubby had the Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs Smoked & Glazed in Roy's Original Mongolian Sauce. A bit cliche, but they were finger lickin' good! My step-daughter and I shared the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi Beurre Blanc -- it was huge and almost a meal. The rolls were fresh, crunchy, and had a little kick . . . not too spicy. It was a good thing I agreed to help her with it! For entrees, my hubby had the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi with Spicy Soy Mustard Butter Sauce. It, too, was an ample portion of tender ahi that was complimented by the sauce but no overpowered by it. My step-daughter had the Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi with Maine Lobster Essence. Another nice portion of perfectly cooked Mahi.  We all were starting to feel the aloha spirit . . . I had to be the exception by ordering off the regular menu and chose my most favorite entree of all . . . the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish . . . Aah, what a delight, so melt-in-your-mouth delicate . . . I was in island heaven.  Desserts were total home runs -- the melting hot chocolate souffle is mandatory for any chocolate lover. In fact, it tastes the same at every Roy's we've been to . . . it never disappoints. A total surprise . . . and a delightful one . . . was the chocolate coconut cheesecake which came with a side of mango sorbet . . . or did she say it was pineapple sorbet . . . whatever . . . it was the perfect accompaniment to the light and fluffy cheesecake.  We also ordered a bottle of Newton claret which was a modestly priced wine and as my husband said as he swirled and sipped it . . . \"I know my wines . . . \" Having to always be the exception, I ordered the he Original Hawaiian Martini, which was what I considered my dessert. It was a juicy combination of Maui pineapple, vodka and coconut rumMMMMM!  It was truly a beautiful evening from start to finish. You may be asking why I didn't give it five stars then if there were no misfires . . . that five star is reserved for Roy's Hawaiian restaurants that really do create the aloha experience with some special touches only that can only be enjoyed there!"}
{"text":"Similar to the one I've been to in LA.  I like the service and the food.  Great fish!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here this year.  I had been to the Desert Ridge location before and this was my first time dining at this location.  I was really excited to celebrate here but the overall experience fell short.  Great food but average service.  I will say the extras they provided for it being a special occasion are awesome.  Not sure if I will visit this location again but remain a fan of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Schechuan spicy pork ribs. That's all you need to order. The mango margaritas were good too. The dinner plates were alright. 4 stars for the ribs! Would dine again just for the ribs"}
{"text":"took a ride there last night - what a over priced yuppy hangout - small portions - $30.00 for two drinks and a dessert - i don't know what asian fusion is but i do know  great food - not at this place........"}
{"text":"We are never disappointed!  We've been to 5 Roy's so far and have told many of our friends and family who have come away with great reviews! Many love the butterfish, shortribs, lobster gyoza (potstickers),  and souffle! Many more!!!    On this trip, this group had a convention.  So as usual, we made reservations for the one night, we could take our friends.  We ordered drinks, two bottles of wine, and a 'Canoe' with all the favorite things I love to eat there!  For dinner, 2 of us ordered the butterfish and the other two ordered the ribs!  For dessert, I asked the waiter, if he could start a souffle and mentioned that one of our friends had a birthday coming up.  So he brought a very tiny (two bite piece of cake) with \"Happy Birthday\" scribbled in chocolate on the plate!  Oh, a candle of course!  Always onolicious!  Mahalo, Roy's, for the great kaukau!"}
{"text":"Love the food, service and the \"feeling\" of being in Hawaii once you are greeted at the door! They know how to do food right! Love the misoyaki butter fish, my personal favorite, and the ahi poki! It is a place where you must let all your senses savor each bite! Even my \"I'll never eat fish\" daughter will only eat  the poki at Roy's.  It is not a 'shovel and chomp' joint, so go there to indulge in the food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Anniversary dinner to remember! Made a rez online. Started with the appy boat. Had the short rib and the butterfish. Incredible! Topped off by an incredible chocolate lava cake.  Even gave us a memento photo. Nice touch. First class night and dinner."}
{"text":"I took my wife for Valentine's day, she had the Hawaiin snapper, and I had the butterfish. Both were fresh and excellent. The appetizers were crab sushi roll and Kobe beef. The soup was lobster bisque. The dessert was molten chocolate cake. All were fantastic. They only had a fixed price menu, and my total bill for 2, including tip, came to $185. I had one glass of wine, and coffee. This was the most I have ever spent in a restaurant, and while the food, ambience and service were supurb, I don't think I will be returning soon, since I don't have money to burn. However, if cost is no object, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"OMG food is somehow transformed from great to legendary at Roy's. No doubt the best seafood you will ever have without being next to the ocean."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner. Appetizers were very tasty! Then had house salad, dinner was shrimp with rice YUM! And rib roast was good too. The chocolate desert was yummy as well. Service was quick and very polite. Dinner and 4 drinks was $180.00."}
{"text":"My wonderful husband took me to Roy's for our 15th wedding anniversary!  We had the most amazing time... the service was wonderful and we were treated so special!    We opened our menus to see a beautiful personalized \"Happy Anniversary\" page inside.  They also put a pretty ring of Hawaiian flowers around our candle so everyone who came to bring us anything knew it was a special occasion.    The food was outstanding.  We had the a great sushi roll for appetizer and the butterfish and mahi mahi dishes were both delish!    They brought us out a cheesecake type dessert with Happy 15th Anniversary written in chocolate but we also had to order the famous chocolate souffle!  It really is worth it... one of the best desserts we have ever had!    They also took our picture and printed it out right then for us, with a nice paper frame.  I felt like they went above and beyond to make our evening special!  I would definitely recommend Roy's for an anniversary celebration!"}
{"text":"I had a unhappy experience a few weeks ago at Roy's for our anniversary. I was persuaded to try it again for my husband's birthday. We attended the Wagner's Wine roll out. This was a special event with 5 courses and 5 different wines. We had a wonderful time. The service was spot on. All the Wagner wine was amazing. Wagner had both red and white wines. I would buy this wine at Roy's or Total Wines. The food was perfectly paired with the wine. Roy's even substituted out one item due to a food allergy for me. This event has renewed my faith in Roy's! I would recommended attending any wine event or having a wonderful evening out at Roy's!"}
{"text":"My bf took me here for dinner on valentines day. We've been to the Roy's in Hawaii and we just recently moved here so this was our first fine dining experience in Las Vegas. Couldn't have ask for a better place for our first experience. The service was amazing and the food was just excellent. The pork belly appetizer was so good it melted in your mouth. my bf loved the Onaga they had. And of course the chocolate soufflé is always a winner. Can't wait to be back here again. Definitely a taste of Hawaii in the desert."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently went to Roy's while staying at the JW.  I had read the other reviews on Yelp, and thought it would make for a nice evening.  What a complete disappointment!  The food was NOT good, and the price tag only made matters worse.  I had the blackened ahi, which was served with a lump of flavorless, cold white rice.  My husband, who is not a fish eater, went for the chicken breast, which was also cold and remarkably bland.   Luckily, the meal was preceeded by a nice, strong martini, and excellent service, which is the only reason this review is landing two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"I had a tough time deciding where to celebrate my birthday. There are so many good restaurants in Las Vegas. Well, I'm glad I picked Roy's. It was a first, and I wanted the place to be something I haven't tried before. They really go out of there way to make your birthday special. There was a card on the table with flowers announcing it's your birthday. I had several people walk by wishing me happy birthday, catching me by surprise. Towards the end, they took a picture of us and framed it and brought a delicious key lime cheesecake or something. Now on to the food: it was all delicious. I couldn't decide between the short rib or rib eye, two of my favorite cuts of beef. The waiter suggested the short rib, which we both got, He said that's was Roy's signature dish when he started. It was so good and tender. I loved the flavoring and the extra touch of grilling it in the end (they had to do that after it was braised). The mashed potatoes it sat on was also so delicious. Then, to end the night we got the chocolate souffle, which was heaven. Oh, and our waiter was very good and professional. I can't wait to go back and try other things if I can resist getting the short ribs again (I'm very bad at sticking to things that I like)."}
{"text":"It had that look of a hotel restaurant and the two sullen girls at the hostess station couldn't seem to decide who would least like to seat us. Finally we were shown to the smallest table they could find in the half-empty restaurant. And from there it went downhill. it was not what I've come to expect from Roy's.  The drinks. My son enjoyed the Hawaiian martini. I had the mai tai. Unfortunately, I know what a mai tai is supposed to taste like. And this one lacked the real fruit flavor and the proper liquor counterpoint. It was too sweet and syrupy. They remade it for me and it was equally as bad.  The appetizers. The pork ribs were a little smoky for me, but were meaty and well cooked and the glaze was tasty. But I don't know what they were trying to accomplish with the short rib bi bim bap. The short rib itself was over marinated and had an awful pasty texture. The confusing and ill-conceived combination of ingredients bore little relation to the wonderful texture and seasoning of a properly made bi bim bap. A deconstructed fusion gone wrong.  We each ordered Roy's trio, but can only give them one out of three for edibility. The salmon which we ordered medium rare was overcooked and not all that fresh. The blackened ahi was cold in spots and warm in spots. It may have been prepared in advance, frozen and partially thawed. That's just a guess. I'm not sure exactly how they screwed it up. The butterfish was tasty and had good texture. That said, the sauce was so cloyingly intense I could not have eaten a full portion.  We didn't risk dessert.   Roy, you need to visit Phoenix and see what they've done to your food and your name."}
{"text":"I've been to numerous Roy's locations and have always enjoyed their food... Unfortunately it wasn't the case at this location. Ambiance was nice with a great band playing on the patio... Service was great... However, the food was an absolute disappointment. Maybe \"quality fresh fish in AZ\" just isn't a thing?!? But we were surprised by the poor quality if the 4 fish sampler AND the sushi rolls. A disappointing experience."}
{"text":"We have a Roy's in Dallas, which I have passed on several occasions. I've always heard great things about it, but have never been. I'm glad we made it here and will be going to the one back home sometime soon.   The restaurant was not what I thought it would be. It was more of clean lines, dark wood bar, open kitchen. Maybe the bastardized Hawaiian theme was in my head, but that definitely wasn't it. Once seated our server promptly greeted us.  The menu has a wide range of menu options starting with sushi, then appetizers and entrees. I was going to order a few pieces of sushi but quickly changed my mind when I saw they had Kobe carpaccio. I was let down though when I saw the portion. The measly bits of beef were hidden by a mound of arugula. The dish was disappointing. My entree of Macadamia nut crusted Mahi Mahi with lobster sauce was fantastic. Every ingredient on the dish balanced perfectly together from the sweetness of the fish and the nuts and the lightness of the sauce...it was all perfect. I passed on dessert but was given tastes of those who did order and Roy's sorbet was a perfect ending to the meal. A trio of sorbet of Lychee, Mango and Coconut had perfect texture.   The server did forget one of my friends dishes but quickly made up for it. Besides that one hiccup we never waited for a thing and service was always prompt.  I don't see Roy's as a destination restaurant in Vegas, but I wouldn't complain if asked to go."}
{"text":"I returned for my birthday because Joel Roebuchon would not accept a Baby as a guest...:/ Of course! Anyway...I am glad we did. Eventhough my hubby desperately wanted to splurge and indulge us for a Michelin star experience I am glad we ended up with Roys. We came here a bit early but were seated pretty much right away. The service again was very attentive. They took a picture for us that they framed and signed in the back. This was free! Yes! I insist. Not like Planet Hollywood were we could have purchased the same thing for 10 bucks...LOL. Of course that's a tourist trap...but still it's worth to compare things that could be considered equal. The food was great too but it was not as good as during my first visit. It was slightly salty (I had the salmon with the goat cheese and spinach crust). However the service was top notch and the experience was pleasant and memorable. And I got my little birthday cake surprise as well. Our baby girl got also a cute little dessert with a sundance scoop and a bit of chocolate. I am sure we probably would have paid big bucks at Roebuchon for it...Great! Our tummies and Sophie's piggy bank is filled. What more could you ask for???"}
{"text":"Last night, we celebrated My birthday and Mother's day at Roy's.  This is our second experience and it almost matched our first.   The food was wonderful and our server Timothy was great even though the restaurant was totally crowded because of Mom's day.  Our one problem was that they sat us next to a water station and I had a wait person running behind me all the time.  I finally moved around the table but was now looking at the water station.  I believe, they should have moved us when it was brought to their attention.  The food was wonderful as before."}
{"text":"I will recommended this place as the service is great. They even prepared me a birthday gift and surprise. I'm definitely buying it! But the steak was little bit plain with not so much choices. Personally the pork was more flavored and seasoned with BBQ source. Impressed overall."}
{"text":"Food good but not great service for a holiday when the hotel and restaurant were half empty. We ordered a second glass of wine when the waitress cleared our appetizer and it did not come until we were done with our entrees. Took good care of our kids requests but waited another 15-20 minutes to pay once our check was dropped. Overall 2 hour dinner experience with lots of waiting."}
{"text":"Overall, this was a great experience! We went for a birthday, and the staff goes above and beyond to make your whole party feel special. I'm not sure if Roy's advertises this anywhere, but they offer a prix fixe menu on Sundays and Mondays. It's not listed on the menu, so we just asked our server. It's $36 for any appetizer, any entree (aside from their mixed platters, which are an additional $6), and any dessert. The whole table took advantage of this offer, and we had so much food! It's definitely worth it if you're planning on ordering appetizers and desserts anyway.   I got the shellfish sampler, which comes with two massive tiger prawns, one scallop, a lobster tail, a huge portion of creamy jasmine rice, and asparagus. It was delicious!   The servers were attentive and friendly, too. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town so first time here nice atmosphere we just pretty much stuck to the aloha hour menu except for dessert Which I will get to. The appies were very good as were the drinks we tried almost all between the 4 of us. Good value at 7$ a piece. Did look at the dinner menus which looked amazing but pricey. As for dessert  go to the chocolate soufflé as soon as you can it's amazing"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I wanted to try this place and I finally did last week.  The location is good and the ambiance is vibrant (at least on a Friday).  However the service was slow and nothing impressive.   The food was average at the most. I had the lobster potstickers which were good and the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi. The spicy butter sauce was more spicy than expected (horseradish type of spiciness) and the flavor wasn't that great anyways.  For desert I had the chocolate dish that takes 20 minutes to make (they tell you in advance, so that's not a problem) which was actually pretty good.  For the price the place is not worth it. It's ok for a date but not if you're looking for good food. Specially if you're not willing to drop $60 per person and leave unsatisfied.   Cheers."}
{"text":"Anniversary night out. Filet & lobster, $33 ea. Included; cheapo wedge salad. Filet was as big and thin a hamburger patty, tough and mostly gristle. The lobster tail was fantastic. A little dab of baby spinach ? dressing on it. $82.,Yikes! They did buy back the gristle for $25. Never again!"}
{"text":"My 2 teenage daughters and I treated ourselves to a nice dinner at Roy's during our stay at the resort.  I wouldn't say that it was a bad meal, but definitely not worth the high price tag for what we got.  We decided to share 2 appetizers, 2 main dishes and a dessert, so we could get a taste of several things.  Our bill was $150, and we only had water to drink.  Here's what we ordered...  Appetizer sampler canoe for 3 - one sample per person of 5 different appetizers.  each item was pretty good, and presentation was beautiful...but I'm not an Iron Chef judge, so I'd rather have a little more quantity for the high price.  Kalbi Spring Rolls - fried spring rolls with a Korean chojang sauce (Korean red pepper paste).  definitely not worth ordering again.  Hibachi Salmon - 6 oz. salmon cooked perfectly w/ literally a little triangle of rice on the side.    Hawaii Short Ribs - 6 oz. short ribs were melt in your mouth tender, and very flavorful.  Warm Chocolate Souffle - ordered when we sat down to allow for 20 minute preparation.  our favorite part of the meal!  In short, we enjoyed our dinner, ambiance and location on the resort property...but I just wish they would give a little bigger portion to their dishes for the prices they charge.  I don't think we'd return on our next visit."}
{"text":"The service here is awesome just like the food. The calamari was amazing and the lobster pot stickers were delicious. Fun little get away here in the valley."}
{"text":"This has forever and a day been my favorite Restaurant, my daughters as well. So when I asked her where she wanted to go for her Birthday , this is where she choose. Now we had not been to this location ever.  Just some of the others around the Country and Hawaii. Plus it had been well over a year since we had even visited Roy's, but they were the shiny star of my memories. Every thing you could ever want in a Seafood Restaurant.  When I made the reservation they asked if it was a special occasion, I told them it was Rachel's B day. When we arrived they told her Happy Birthday and gave us special menus on the inside it said Happy Birthday Rachel and the date. Wow, I thought that was pretty amazing.  Our server was an amazing girl that thought of every thing. The manager even came over to wish my daughter a Happy Birthday. All the drinks were usurper! The food was truly amazing!! We had the Canoe for two for starters, even though there were 3 of us, there was more than enough. Plus, Mario got a salad which he said was delish!  We had the Butterfish , the Mahi Mahi , and the Old School combo,which was 4 fish dishes on one large dish.Mario had that one. Every thing was perfect, I mean everything.  For dessert we had the Chocolate Souffle and they even treated the Birthday girl to a wonderful Creme Burle, with fresh fruit and chocolate cake. They even put Happy Birthday in chocolate sauce on her dessert plate. Yes it is expensive but, at least you are getting what you pay for .  Great service and Great food."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  We go their every year for restaurant week and for their AWESOME HAPPY HOUR!    If you order all the small plates on their Aloha Hour (430P-630P) it come to $30.00 plus $5.00 drink specials, which is very eloborate and you will find something for everyone.  Everytime I have been to their Aloha Hour (aka Happy Hour) I get full by order all 6 small plates and it is shared!  Now that I have been a few times to Aloha Hour, I know what I really love and will just order those.  I can't seem to think anything negative about Roy's and their Aloha Hours.  So instead of reading me happily raging about them, especially their Aloha Hour....GO!!!  But if you do work a 8a-5p job, perhaps choose a day and leave the office early to make it to the HH.  That is the only thing I have a critic about."}
{"text":"Excellent service, atmosphere and food! The braised short rib and chocolate doughnut holes are amazing!"}
{"text":"Roy's is a chain isn't to be disputed. But, it has some of the best service I've had at any restaurant. We had great service from the moment we made our reservation to the moment we drove away.    My friend J and I wanted to have a great last night in Vegas for our girls 72 hours out. We made reservations that afternoon for eight pm and we showed up early. To our surprise, the restaurant wasn't half full. We were allowed to sit early and from then on, it was having all the attention we could handle.     We both had the Summer Fusion Prix Fixe dinner for $35. It's three courses which is an app, entree and dessert. Not bad at all price wise. J started with seared tuna, then had short ribs and finished with a strawberry shortcake. The ribs were so tender they fell apart at the touch of a fork. I had the arugula, pear, goat cheese and macadamia nut salad, the prosciutto wrapped shrimp with fried egg fried rice and then the molten chocolate cake. All were really good - I liked the fact they had two fat jumbo shrimp wrapped in a nice size of prosciutto and the fried rice had a nice smoky background. The molten cake was silky inside and crisp outside.     A great food experience and worth going off Strip for."}
{"text":"My favorite place to visit is Maui, and my favorite fish is black cod (aka \"butterfish\"), so what better place to spend my birthday than at Roy's, the closest I could get to Hawaii without visiting the California Hotel downtown.  One of my other favorite things is a bargain, and Roy's is currently having a prix fixe promotion on Sundays and Mondays (through March 6) where you can choose any appetizer, entree, and dessert for $36.95. Seeing how their butterfish alone is $39, I had to act. And, thankfully, my birthday was on a Monday this year!  I had been to Roy's before (at the now-closed Summerlin location), where I had the best sushi roll of my life--a \"Town and Country\" that featured wagyu beef and crab--so I ordered the \"Lakanilau,\" which had similar ingredients. Of course I got the butterfish for my entree, and I had the lime tart for dessert. My husband had the poke bowl, sea scallops, and Japanese cheesecake. And we also had a complimentary bowl of edamame, which was served midcourse. Without the prix fixe deal, the food alone would have set us back $127, but with a bottle of wine and a pretty handsome tip, this whole meal was only $140. Quite the bargain!  But what about the food? The standout was definitely the poke bowl. It was beautifully presented, with a delicious mix of ahi, salmon, and hamachi. I would come back for that alone! Everything else was good, but nothing really stood out (although that butterfish was pretty tasty). And I guess I had lofty goals for the Lakanilau, which was fine but a little disappointing.  Overall, it was a great meal, and I'm glad I spent my birthday there. (Mostly because the price was right, but also because I've found the best poke bowl in town!)"}
{"text":"This is my Wife's Favorite place to eat out. Have to take her here every time we are in town. We have had a lot off the menu and everything is so good. They have taken care of us, every time we come... thank you."}
{"text":"Roy's is an escape in this crazy city we call Vegas...  Not to far off the strip, you'll find Roy's tucked between a number of other great franchise restaurants like Fogo De Chao, etc.  It's a modern building with valet and normal parking.  Once inside, you'll be greeted by a modern hawaiian theme with warm tones.  The restaurant is noticeably more quiet than other restaurants I've visited in Vegas.  I didn't love the decor or atmosphere, but it's a refreshing change of pace from your normal Vegas restaurants.  The service here is the best I've ever experienced in a restaurant.  I've been here multiple times (even in different cities) and it consistently exceeds expectations.  If you are celebrating a special occasion, let them know and you'll be treated to a special evening.  For a friends birthday, they provided customized menu's with a birthday note and took / provided a printed picture of our table.  The picture was framed in a Roy's birthday paper frame for keepsake.  The food here (as well as the other Roy's I've visited in other cities) is always delicious.  In Vegas, I've had their Salmon, hanger steak, butterfish, and macadamia crusted mahi mahi.  Again, all delicious with no complaints on any of these entrees.  The portions are a healthy size too.  You can't go wrong.  The best thing you can try at Roy's is their Chocolate Soufflé.  This is the best dessert that I've ever had... hands down.  It's basically a molten cake with raspberry and vanilla bean ice cream.  It's not even right how good this damn thing is...  it's not even right."}
{"text":"First off, I will NEVER patron Roy's in Chandler ever again!! Please read on to see why...  A friend and I went for Aloha hour and it was awesome. Everything on the HH menu is only $5!   We enjoyed everything from the food, drinks, & service, that we decided to come back and try their dinner menu.  9/4/2010 My friends tried the Hibachi Style Grilled Salmon, they both were quite pleased. Perfect portion size, above average quality but yet still a bit pricey. Nonetheless, the dish was quite satisfying.   For my meal I had the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish.  It came with black \"forbidden\" rice and bok choy.  Each flaky bite was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Excellent choice!  This is where it gets ugly... As our average service was about to conclude, the waiter drops our check off. I ask him for another cup of coffee and as he pulls his hand back from delivering the check, he knocks a quarter glass of wine all over my friend and her phone. He proceeds to apologize and cleans a portion of it up, then walks away. He never returns for the coffee I asked for, nor did he offer to refill my friend's $8 glass of wine. I gave him time to reconcile as I saw him pace back and forth but to no avail. I had to chase him down for my refill on coffee. Despite my friend getting wine spilled over her without compensation, our party decided to reflect our displeasure through our tip (~8%) opposed to an open, verbal complaint. However, our waiter wasn't pleased with his gratuity. He came back to the table after he discovered his low tip. YES! He actually had the nerve to return to our table as if he didn't understand why he received a low tip! He spilled wine, which we had paid for, on the customer without compensating for it! What did he expect??  He came back to the table asking if we were displeased with his service. Astonished by his ignorance, we explained to him what we were displeased with. Get this... He didn't think spilling the wine over my friend wasn't a big deal because he thought it was a small amount and that she was finished anyway. Imagine a waiter spilling a paid for glass of wine over you and justifying it because you were almost done anyway. Absolutely ridiculous! Plus, what did he expect from us at that point. Did he expect that we would change our minds and tip him more? The waiter apologized once more and we just got up and left. Our server, THOMAS  the absolute most ungrateful, inappropriate & rude bastard of a server I've ever encountered!!  The manager was of no assistance either. Just a note, in the Service Industry, there is no verbal apology that is acceptable. In the Service Industry, the only apology comes in the form of compensation. The manager apologized but asked if we would like to have gift certificates. That's like saying \"May I say 'Sorry' to you?\" He should've given, not asked to give. Putting the onus on the customer is an insult. We declined since acceptance would paint us as opportunists.  Bottom line you expect above the standard level of service when you're shelling out $25-40 per entree.  So even though the food was great, the horrible experience with how we were treated is cause enough to never return to this location.  It's like being slapped in the face but saying it's okay because the food was wonderful...NO THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"We had a problem with the service last week, but I can't express how impressed I was with the way Roy's and the managing partner handled it afterward.  That is why I recommend Roy's and keep coming back.  Everyone stumbles--it is how you acknowledge the fact and then fix it that matters.  BTW, Roy's is great with food allergies and gluten intolerance."}
{"text":"I stopped by this restaurant with a group of my friends who recommended this place.  The restaurant itself was dimly lit (very romantic) and classy looking.  We started off with a bottle of wine and the service was great!  The appetizers were decent.  The calamari was crisp and not too soggy or fried tasting.  Someone ordered the cut roll (California roll?) and it was okay.  I think this just wasn't the place for cut rolls.  But when dinner came, everything looked yummy.  The Butterfish seemed to be a big hit.  All their fish was moist and tender!  And you must save room for their molten lava cake!  I agree with everyone else...it's that good!! Definitely enough to share amongst 2 or 3 people.  Overall this was a great place to have a fancier dinner with someone.  The service and ambiance was nice.  It is a little pricey, but you'd probably know that if you chose to eat at a place like this ;)"}
{"text":"Restaurant with average  bill per person of more than $50 and the can't even bring three appetizers out at same time, and the chef can't distinguish  medium and well done. Even if the flavors were on point, it Doesn't deserve more than three stars. However, the way management handled the situation was impeccable. They took off the dishes that were unsatisfactory and the desert saved the day! I hope that next time I go, I will be able to give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"5 star's? Ur darned right.  Let me tell you, I'm here in Las Vegas on vacation to spoil myself.  Am I glad I came across this place.  First off, Ben my waiter, was top notch. Very attentive to me as well as the other tables he was talking care of. Polite, helpful, and just all around professional at his job. It appeared that he really enjoyed his work.  Thanks again Ben.  Now as for the food.  Great quality. Well prepared exactly to my liking. Which those of you who cook know that medium can be kinda hard to get right. Not long enough it's medium rare, and too long it's medium well. By the way,I had the ribeye.  Let me tell you that it was brown on both sides hot in the middle.  The restaurant atmosphere was comfortably dim, waiters and staff very well dressed. The kitchen was like an open bar w/ a low wall around it. You can here and watch them go through the motions as your order is being prepared.  Dessert was just great. Pineapple upside-down cake w/ coconut ice cream with coconut shavings.  The entire meal literally melted in my mouth.  Definitely worth every penny. I'll be back for sure. AND they have one in sf.  Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So sad. Went there tonight for our anniversary and we spent most of the dinner flagging down other servers. The waiter forgot our request 4 times, as if he had the attention span and memory of a gnat   It was so bad it tarnished the evening and we left to go somewhere else for dessert. There was no manager to be found   We will not be going back"}
{"text":"This location is great. Food is amazing and staff are wonderful. The butterfish is so delicious."}
{"text":"I had wanted to dine at Roy's and got a chance tonight while attending a seminar in one of their dining rooms. The restaurant is well laid out and the wait staff were exceptional this evening!   On the menu: APPETIZERS Asian Chilled Shrimp w/ spicy Lime Cocktail Sauce Thai Chicken Satay w/Bangkok Style Peanut Dipping Sauce Crispy Wagyu Beef Dumpling w/Chili Lime Soy  SALAD Baby Greens Salad Shaved Carrot - Daikon - Heirloom Tomatoes - Onion Shoyu Vinaigrette  ENTREE (my selection) Grilled 8 oz. Filet Mignon Truffle Misoyaki Demi Glace  DESSERT Belgian Chocolate Torte Raspberry Sauce - Seasonal Berries - Vanilla Whipped Cream  All were delicious but my favorite was the Crispy Wagyu Beef Dumpling! Seasoned very well and Very flavorful! My Filet Mignon was cooked to a perfect medium !  If an opportunity comes up, I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Went to celebrate our anniversary. A nice table was waiting with a nice card. For a Sunday evening the place was packed and they were understaffed which the waitress let us know. We each enjoyed the 3 course meal and shared an appetizer (lobster rolls) and Caesar salad. I loved my black cod as did my husband like his mahi-mahi. Desserts were food as well. Service and kitchen slow. Would consider coming back."}
{"text":"the food was amazing, the service was great, and the location was beautiful!"}
{"text":"The Husband and I went here for our anniversary in July of 2012 (that is how long this review has been sitting in my drafts folder, so unfortunately this is the world's shortest review). The service was perfect. The food was amazing...try the butterfish!"}
{"text":"Was a little pricey for my wife and I and 6 yr old... $216.00. I had a filet mignon, lobster tail combo... tail was  small, and I thought if my filet was good, it would be no big deal. Instead, I had 3 different bites of my filet (also small) that were very grisly. They did remake me a new filet - which brought them back to a 4, although my wifes full size filet was very dry. They did offer to take both off the bill, so kudos for that although we told them to leave it on the bill since we both ended up getting our fill. Dessert and appetizers were very good, but $50 for two drinks each was a bit much."}
{"text":"I really like this roys.  The location is right around the corner from where I was staying, Hard Rock.  I always enjoy the service and the chocolate souffe here all though the entree is always so-so.    The best part was the staff letting us substitue a whole boat load of stuff from the pre fixe menu.  The only thing holding back from a 5 is the always lacking entrees.  Though I'm limited to the pre fixe, whenever I order the short rib it never taste that great and I'm not so into fish so not going that way."}
{"text":"So me and my husband went to Roys yesterday for my Husband's birthday... By the time we arrive he was greeted and when we sat down to our table there's a greeting card.... Simple things do count!!! But not just that, our Server was very accommodating and super nice I couldn't really feel more Welcomed and the entire time we were there they really made my husband feels special!!! At the end they brought us a key lime pie with a happy birthday on it and candle and they took us a picture and was able to take the picture home as a souvenir!!!!! The food was AMAZING OF COURSE, but hey the Service is the Best!!!!! I couldn't be more Happier!!!!!!! Definitely would come back!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was nice, the server was very friendly, attentive, and knowedgeable of the menu items. The atmosphere was warm, intimate, and relatively quiet. The food was quite good, but unimpressive for the price, (a dinner for two will probably cost around $100.00). Roy's is a good choice and I would recommend for something such as a date night with your spouse or for a quiet special occasion."}
{"text":"The service was fine. We had a reservation and was sat right away. The outside seating was really nice, and there were two live performers during our meal.  We actually came during Aloha Hour (aka Happy Hour), but the server didn't mention anything about it. That's kind of weird, no?   The food was just ok, especially for the price. The lobster bisque came out, and it tasted like a curry. I wanted to pour it over rice. It wasn't thick as other bisques I have had too. The poke was ok, but there wasn't much tuna. It was majority avocado with pieces of tuna and a random unagi on top. I got the prawns over udon, and it had good flavor.  Not too shabby, but I'd probably try another nearby restaurant next time in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Took the wife and daughter for a belated birthday meal and it was WAY more than we ever expected it to be.   Service was impeccable and the food incomparable besides to the islands themselves...looking forward to our return visit, my mouth is already watering!!!"}
{"text":"Roy's is just a little too vanilla for me to give it anything more than three stars. The atmosphere is modern, warm, and comforting. The service is usually spot-on. The food is done with quality ingredients and prepared precisely. However, for everything they do correctly, the food is just a little safe and crowd-pleasing for my tastes.  Upon out last visit, we did the $30 prix fixe deal that is offered on Mondays. It is a great way to go, as you get an app and an entree for the aforementioned price - saving somewhere in the ballpark of $10 (depending on what you order). The two apps we went with (lobster pot stickers and mussels) both were prepared smartly, but there was nothing creative going on. For the entrees, we went with their famous butter fish and scallops. The butter fish is a lovely dish (I have had it before), there is a reason it is the dish they are known for. The scallops (possibly my favorite seafood fare) was completely unimaginative. Combining scallops and pork bellies and coming up with something so bland is almost criminal. Much of the blame I assume has to be centered on the potato puree that provides the base for the dish and deadens much of the flavor. Don't get me wrong, it is completely edible, just ever so blah. The chocolate souffle was a lovely dessert and a great way to end the meal.  Overall, Roy's is a perfectly enjoyable experience. Yet, at the prices they are charging, I expect a little more going on with their food."}
{"text":"What a great evening at Roy's. The Marriott hotel is a beautiful setting for this terrific restaurant. The ambiance is excellent and if you get a chance enjoy your meal on the patio. Our fish entries were delicious and the lobster potstickers were a great starter. And best of all was the fine service provided by Kenny from Shadow Mtn high school. Without a doubt we plan to visit the Marriott Roy's again."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and the staff are so friendly! I can't eat dairy and when I expressed that to the waiter, she helped make many accommodations to my order to get a delicious dairy-free dinner for me! I ordered lobster pot stickers for an appetizer and had fish for dinner and it all arrived quickly to our table! For dessert, all of the options had dairy, but they made me a special desert that was so good! The restaurant has great service, friendly staff and they are very attentive to you having a perfect meal! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Wow what an amazing place to eat.  The service was excellent and is very close to the strip. I had the short ribs and they were amazing and my girlfriend had the butterfish and one of the best fish she ever had great atmosphere and is a beautiful place.."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. I expected much more based on the price points. My daughter (who accompanies me often out to eat) did not like the kids braised short rib. There was no seasoning what so ever. The lump crab fried rice left more to be desired. There was hardly any crab. I give 4 stars because the staff was awesome from the time we walked in to the time we left. The food could just be a little bit better."}
{"text":"This was our second stop for restaurant week.  I wanted to go to a chain restaurant after the experience we had at Noca.  ( i know its sad to say I wanted to visit a chain)  I had a feeling we wouldn't be disappointed.  We had a reservation at 6:30 and arrived a little early so we decided to have a glass of wine in the bar.  We were greeted immediately and our  wine was great!  We were then whisked away to our table.  We had a really friendly server and we ordered our meals right away.  I had the clams with chorizo.  It was delish!  Will had the pork and although it looked to be undercooked it also tasted amazing.    The main entrees we had were the steelhead trout and the flank steak.  Both were awesome.  Then came the dessert.  Will was in an adventurous mood so we ended up having 5 desserts.  Our two favorite by far were the pineapple upside down cake, picture posted soon.  (worth the 20 min wait) and the chocolate souffle cake.    All in all great food and great service!  Would definitely go back for a second visit."}
{"text":"Exceptional service!  My goodness!  Both the servers and back servers are so attentive.  They're careful when placing plates down, when placing drinks in front of you. They're mindful to check on you not too often but at the right time, right before you take your last 2 sips of wine or water.  My friends and I (4 of us), wanted to get dressed up and have a really nice dinner. We debated for days between Hillstone and Roy's.  I love Hillstone too but we wanted more of a variety so we went with Roy's.   Between the 4 of us, we ordered and shared the following: Wedge Salad Calamari Lobster Pot stickers Classic Four  Duck Breast  Roy's Trip Truffle Bacon Mac n Cheese Lobster Fried Rice  2 bottles of wine.  One white.  One red.  The price tag was hefty ... we split it evenly ... about 100 bucks a pop!  We enjoyed every single damn minute of it and would do it all over again!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Roy's in years and what was i thinking?  It was sooo good.  We went for restaurant week but added on some items.  Started with their speciality Hawaiian Martini, very pineapple, good but liked the wine list and the choices more!  We had the calamari as an extra app before we did the pre-fix menu.  YUM!  Then had the scallops, so good but very small, maybe b/c of the restaurant week special.  My mom had the tomato and aspargus, simple but good.  i then had the petite fliet cooked to perfection!!!!  Mom had the trout said it was great!  She kept thinking it was Salmon though....i stole some of her cous-cous, sooo good.  We finished with the flourless chocolate cake.  So rich but so good.  I bet if i could have the ice cream with it it wouldn't be so rich, but who cares!  Over all a GREAT meal.  Mom said best she had all restaurant week."}
{"text":"Great steak, seriously yummy. Did good for gluten-free, wish was little more apps but server was good describing something usually wouldn't eat. Just spread tad bit thin so some drinks took longer but not giant deal bc she was very nice. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"serious 180 from our last experience. Thank you hubby for trying to make our night special. No help from a soon to be Sizzler experience.  We were compensated with some gift cards.  I have to say the next time we came it was Happy Hour on a Tuesday, much less crowded and a sweet waitress, but they wouldn't let's use the gift cards for Aloha Hour.  read fine print***  All in all, too many new happening things in Phoenix.   Food is Good!"}
{"text":"We've been devoted customers of this Roy's location for several years. The food and service have always been top notch. Until last night... Our server and the food were excellent. The busser and management were a complete fail! To begin with, we went with friends last night to celebrate my wife's birthday. We were seated promptly and our server was there immediately to introduce himself and to check on us. Couldn't have started better! As we were finishing our appetizers, the busser started reaching across us to clear plates, glasses, etc. that bothers me especially but maybe not some. Then, as she was standing around during a free monument, she saw fit to regale us with a drum solo tapped out on the wall....... her defining moment came when she was clearing our friends plate from the table and knocked both her and my wife's wine over. She quickly tried to cover the mess, she never however apologized..... management replaced the two glasses of wine and offered to clean our friends top but beyond that, nothing more was offered. Had that happened in our local restaurant, all of our meals would have comped. The least that should have happened is our friends meal be comped. Long term, this busser either needs training or to to be made available to industry......."}
{"text":"The butter fish Service is great super friendly"}
{"text":"My company goes to Vegas twice a year and this is the only restaurant we visit each trip. The food is amazing and the menu is always changing and updating. Whether it's the poke or calamari the butterfish or the sushi I have never had a bad experience in the numerous times I have eaten there. They even went off the menu and served up an AMAZING kimchi for us. Start off with a mojito (not a fan of those drinks but I make an exception when I am there) and enjoy the meal, whatever you order."}
{"text":"Excellent graduation dinner. Had the Roy's trio. The butterfish was amazing. Salmon was great. The mahi was okay. same goes for the mac and cheese. Really good service tho."}
{"text":"Had the red dragon shrimp with a side of the Korean spicy chili rice.   Shrimp was bland.  Rice had not flavor and no spice.  Very mediocre meal.  Had an apple desert where they fire roasted the apple.  Was nasty.   Didn't eat it.   Dinner for two was $100 with one glass of wine.  Was worth maybe $25 max.  If your desperate for Asian food and stuck at the JW Marriott order delivery and avoid this place.  You'll save money and have a better meal."}
{"text":"We keep trying this Roy's again, thinking well it's got to be better next time. It's not. Latest visit featured a rude hostess who got snotty when we politely asked for a different booth (in an *empty* restaurant at 6pm), dry appetizers and overcooked fish entree, and the ambiance just feels like a mediocre hotel restaurant. I don't want to listen to Taylor Swift while I'm eating either... Music choice is odd. Our server was lovely though -- nice gal. I've been to the Roy's in both Palm Desert and on the Big Island and they were fantastic and felt like a real night out. Don't know why this one just can't get their act together. Won't be going back. Very sad this JW Marriott doesn't have one really great restaurant on site."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and very friendly staff. This was my first time trying Hawaiian food so I'm not an expert. Everything was good but personally, it's just not my preference. If Hawaiian fusion is something you like, I would give this place a try.  Nice atmosphere! They have NYE specials and a special menu for dinner that night."}
{"text":"We have been dining at this Roy's for many years.. The food and service has always been excellent. My husband usually get trio of fish which has their signature mahi mahi, butter fish and salmon. It's like getting 3 amazing entrees in one. They have a separate vegetarian menu which has a lot of options. I highly recommend the bento box and spring rolls. Their chocolate lava cake is to die for. They do a great job if you are celebrating a special occasion.. My kids 10 and 8 only want to celebrate their bday at Roy's. We always ask for Michelle who is one of their best servers. She is the best!! She always remembers my kids names and even tho we celebrated my husband's bday, she got a special treat for my boys. The hostess is also very friendly. Overall, this Roy's location treats us just like family, that's what makes us visit here so often."}
{"text":"To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. Our anniversary dinner. We've done this 4 of our 10 anniversaries.  The food is amazing. Service was disappointing tonight.  We ordered dessert at the beginning of the meal and it never made it to our table bc it took forever. It took longer to get coffee and dessert than it did our main course. You come to Roy's for a different level of dining. Today the service was Applebee's. Idk if my wife will let us come back."}
{"text":"What a treat.  From the food to the wonderful staff.  My son has special diet concerns and the waiter didn't miss a beat.  The serving staff explained the dish and verified what was used in the making.  My first time there and I will be back.  Great!"}
{"text":"Good finish after a rocky start - our steaks were all way overcooked.  Our server had our orders re-made beautifully and then comped our wine, salads and dessert without being asked.  The manager on duty was very nice and concerned and we ended up having a great time.  The hit of the evening was the pineapple upside down cake with handmade coconut ice-cream - OMG!"}
{"text":"This place is beginning to develop the feel of becoming a chain restaurant since they have become a chain restaurant and lost their exclusivity. Waiters and waitresses were very hurried and not granted the luxury of working with an appropriate amount of tables. Three greeters appeared bored while wait staff appeared understaffed and food produced was incredible but requests to be made vegetarian were not met."}
{"text":"My son & his wife kept telling me about this phenomenal restaurant. As I am from MI., I came to AZ to visit them bringing my 2 grandkids on this road trip. Of course, being the good son that he is, we all went here on our last night in town. And I wasn't disappointed. Walking into his establishment, I was amazed at the colorful decor. Splashes of vivid color in a Hawaiian themed restaurant were beautiful. The 2-D wall art was tastefully displayed. Upon being seated, our wait person, Anthony, was informative and gracious beyond reproach. From the 1st glass of water until our last bite of dessert, Anthony made our dining experience over the top. We began with calamari. OMG !! Melt in your mouth tender & battered to perfection. Piled high bite size pieces instead of rings. I had the trio which consisted of Butter Fish, Ahi Tuna & grilled Salmon. Each fish was drizzled with a different sauce which complimented each individual fish. To die for is an understatement. The presentation of each of our separate entrees was nothing but classy. After dinner, Anthony surprised us with their signature pineapple upside down cake & chocolate souffle. Both desserts were rich & delectable without being sweet.  As each of us ordered something different, it would take to much time to tell you what we each had. I would just strongly suggest that you make a date to take that special person in your life to Roy's for an unforgettable dining experience. Just ask for Anthony to be your server. I promise you won't be disappointed. Kudos to Roy's Restaurant & its staff of professionals !!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best!  I worked for this establishment 7 years ago and I am not being biased in any which way or form.  I have been to the Oahu locations, Vegas, and Rancho Mirage and everyone of them exceeds my expectations in so many ways.  Everything about this establishment is legit.  Even the owner Roy Yamaguchi himself made a couple of surprise visits and always took a liking to what I was creating during my first job as a line cook.  They really do have that Ohana spirit and starts at the Top with Roy and his Executive Chef Mako Segawa.  They have a passion for what they do and all of our ingredients are fresh and prepped all day long and you taste it every night at service.  The location is beautiful inside the JW Marriott and very comfortable.  The staff is incredibly knowledgeable at every location and they seem to really care.  I remember going to Oahu and I told the staff I worked for Roy's and without blinking an eye they gave me a free appetizer.  I could have been pulling their leg for all they know and yet they still gave me the Ohana spirit."}
{"text":"Anthony G was awesome! It was easily the best restaurant experience I've had. Anthony was super helpful and intentional about helping us celebrate my birthday. We sat at the bar where you watch the cooks making the food and the appetizer gentleman was super interactive and nice. He was super informative and nice to talk to. Everyone was so nice and helpful! I'm in awe of their service!"}
{"text":"So, I've been to Roy's several times over the last several years, mainly because we live nearby. It's nice to come over here and pretend we are on vacation and have a nice meal. Recently, the Hubs and I went out for \"Date Night\" and since we have a little one now, we aren't getting out much. This time around, we decided to go to Roy's for Happy Hour, since it's close to home and the weather is so nice right now, making it perfect for sitting outside. Honestly the outside seating is delightful. You really do feel like you're in Hawaii, minus the ocean.  Anyway, we were sat outside and asked if we could do Happy Hour out there... after some confusion and having to ask for the menu again, we were told we could. The food was solid, nothing fabulous, but overall good (the sliders and soufflé were the highlights), but the service made the whole experience... meh. I don't know if our waiter was just annoyed we were taking up one of his tables and ordering off the happy hour menu or what, but he just seemed so annoyed with us from the get-go. It was really uncomfortable, and took away from the rare date night my Husband and I get. I was pretty disappointed overall, and even considered leaving at the beginning of the meal. I hate feeling like I am not wanted somewhere... it stinks.  As I said before, we've been to Roy's many times before and had great experiences. In fact we went with friends on NYE and it was great. Great service and good food, but something about this past experience has left a bad taste in my mouth...."}
{"text":"I usually get the salmon or another fish as an entree, however, decided to try the filet mignon. I am so glad I did! Delicious - tender - great sauce. Had a very attentive waiter and the service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"When we first arrived I was shocked. I was not expecting such a nice place. Didn't do much research about Roy's so when we walked in we immediately felt underdressed and quite out of place. But the service was fantastic. Our waiter was named Sean and he made the awkwardness go away immediately and made us feel welcome. He surprised us with our entrees and we were not disappointed. Great service and fantastic food. The manager TJ along with Sean made our awkward dinner turn into a night to remember with great food. Definitely will be back for more, just with a little more formal attire."}
{"text":"I LOVE this Roys!!!  I've been there twice now and both times have had excellent service.  Besides always having the best Misoyaki butterfish and short ribs, they always give you a little something extra.  Always love the complimentary edamame.  First time we went in, we couldn't decide on how many chocolate souffles to order.  So what did they do?  They brought us an extra one (on the house) to make sure we all had enough!  WOW!!!   You think it can't get any better but it definitely was on our second visit.  Being a YELPER I had a check in offer of a free Hawaiian martini...  All I did was mention it to my waiter, he saw my EIGHT other friends were trying to find it and even still sign up for YELP on their phone and he brought out NINE FREE martinis!  No pressure at all...  Then besides again having great food and service, they brought out the yummiest bday desserts for two of my friends!!!  Then to top it off they took our group picture and gave all NINE of us a copy.  They really make you feel special and I definitely make it a point to go back when I am in Vegas!!!  I feel like it is a pricey restaurant but you truely get your moneys worth plus MORE!"}
{"text":"All I need to say is Short Ribs. We booked the restaurant for a wedding renewal (10 year anniversary) and boy did we have a great time. So good in fact I managed to talk the Chef into bringing the kitchen staff into the private dining room for a Gasser style Thank You. standing ovation. What did they do that was sooo great? They delivered a high quality meal by exceeding my expectations with the details: Our kids names in chocolate on dessert plates, each piece on the plate seemed cooked perfectly form veg to protein to sauces, set up a LCD on the fly, offered $25-100+ bottles of wine (Stages Leap), helped with photos and the services never let my glass run dry. Just outstanding. If you're considering Vegas for a private event this would be the best option in my opinion."}
{"text":"Roy's restaurant is good for dating as well as for big party like birthdays. Very nice atmosphere, always careful and helpful service.  Foods are always exactly what you want to have. They make sure what exactly you want, and always match the expectations. It is not cheap, but I prefer to pay a bit more but not worry about how good it will be. Recommended."}
{"text":"Went to Roy's with a friend who has been to the restaurant twice before. We made reservations at 7pm but showed up at 6pm to take advantage of the happy hour. We were a group of 4 and ordered all of the $7 happy hour appetizers. We got a second round of the sliders because they were amazing. For dinner, I ordered the \"braised short ribs\" and it was very good. The meat was extremely tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"We had an excellent time! Went for restaurant week and my birthday, they were superb! The menu had a special birthday greeting along with a surprise dessert @ the end of the night. The food was awesome, I had the mahi mahi and it was perfect. The service can't be beat, I would go there any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Great food. The service and management were very friendly. And hey, any place with flaming torches is good with me. Do the desert!"}
{"text":"So we just finished dinner at Roy's for Restaurant Week and I must say it was quite impressive.  We're not accustomed to eating out so 'finely' on a week night, but this has been a rough week for dear hubby of mine and I wanted to treat him tonight.  We showed up a bit early before our reservation, so we sat at the bar and were tended by a couple of lovely gals.  I had a very delish grapefruit martini and he a Jameson... then we were taken to our table and commenced the 'feeding process'.  WOW, it's been over an hour since we ate and I'm still 'stuffed to the brim'!  Their portions were very impressive:  Appetizer: I had the Tempura Crusted Spicy Ahi Roll appetizer, he hadthe Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs - consensus: roll was outstanding, accompanied by a fantastic buttery miso; ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and the flavor coating was finger-licking yumminess.  Main Course: I had the Mac Nut Mahi Mahi and he had the Beef Short Ribs.. again, flavorful!  Mahi Mahi is a little too dry for me (it was cooked more rare, which should have helped this already dry meat) and besides the Lobster essence, there wasn't that much excitement going on.. no spark, no za-zamm...(BTW, HUGE portion on the Mahi Mahi).. his short ribs were scrumptious, especially with that braising sauce to smear it with... his dish was way better than my dish. Dessert:  We tried both the Souffle and Cheesecake.. the cheesecake BY FAR outdid the Souffle.  The Souffle was just too rich and too chocolatey... unbearably so!  but the cheesecake was creamy, slightly rich but well balanced with the fats in the crumb base... ugh, so good!  Overall we enjoyed it!  Service was great and I appreciated that Roy's participated in Restaurant Week and had such impressive dishes and delivered on all ends (well, except as noted)."}
{"text":"This was so delicious. We started with sushi as an appetizer that was really good. We both had the Roys trio with the added ahi and each fish was so delicious in its own way. We finished with the chocolate soufflé and were so full but it was so good we had to finish it. Our server Kim was great! She was very attentive and helpful without being too \"in your face\". We definitely want to go back. It was a special occasion for us, otherwise we would not have paid so much for a night out. But the food was definitely worth the price. I told my husband that this is my new birthday dinner place (hopefully he listens )"}
{"text":"I brought my husband to Roy's for Easter dinner. It was a great choice. The food was delicious, and the portion size was spot on. We shared a prefix dinner as an appetizer and dessert and each got our own entrees. We were able to enjoy all courses and snack on soy beans without feeling stuffed. And my husband was impressed by the staff's helpfulness. One waiter escorted an elderly man to the restroom instead of merely showing him where the restrooms were located. It was a great date night experience."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant.  From start to finish, every app, dish and drink was just delicious.  The service was top notch and every single person at our table of 6 was more than satisfied. The sushi and lobster potstickers are to die for as was the Mahi Mahi and Tuna.  This is the type of place where no corners are cut and everything on the menu is probably great. This was first time at a Roy's establishment but it will not be my last."}
{"text":"Fabulous!!! We walked in without a reservation and were seated on the patio.  The cocktails were perfectly timed and the food was outstanding!!"}
{"text":"My recommendation is Aloha hour, great cocktails for a reasonable price and pupu's (in this case a very small snack. The only thing about their pupu's almost everything is spicy. Crispy pork salad very good  The dinner choice I recommend is definitely the Miso fish, butterfish is a small boney fish in Hawaii, this is very well done. I took the shellfish combo and I knew I would regret it. I wanted to grab the Miso plate from my husband. The service was excellent from the hostess, bartender, busboys and servers, what a quality group of people. Hawaii Kai still my favorite but this is a great closer alternative."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years until a week or so ago and now I have been twice in two weeks.  And here is a place to go big - order the Canoe Appetizer for Two. It will not disappoint. I am completely in love with this appetizer.  You really can't go wrong with any of the items on it, and they are completely worth giving a try. Szechuan Ribs - Spicy Tuna Roll - Lobster Potstickers - Filet Yakitori - Chicken Satay  I am in love with the Macadamia Crusted Mahi Mahi with the Lobster Cream Sauce. Even our team in from Boston was impressed with the fish and lobster here.   It was a pleasant surprise going back to Roy's. I need to make it over there more."}
{"text":"WOW! My wife and I were so impressed with Roy's.  First of all - the ambiance.  The resort is gorgeous, and sitting on the patio is a wonderful experience.  I would definitely recommend doing that when the weather is nice, and then walking around the resort after dinner.  Second - the service.  Exceptional, from the hostess to the server assistant to the server to the Manager who came by to welcome us.  Third, and most importantly - the food.  Delicious.  We had the Gyoza, the Wagyu Beef Meatloaf, and the Mac and Cheese, and we ate up every last bite.  We also really enjoyed the complimentary Edamame that's brought to the table in place of bread.  Much healthier.  :-)  Overall, this was an incredible first impression.  So impressive that I'm shocked that Roy's overall review score isn't higher.  Take my word for it.  Check it out, and... ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Word to the wise.  Don't bring your Meg Ryan-like friend (who's allergic to seafood and nuts) to Roy's.  That small detail didn't occur to me at the time, until perusing the menu and realizing that almost everything includes seafood or is cooked in coconut oil or offered with a peanut sauce.    Oopsies.  But on the bright side I had most of the appetizers (sushi, satay and grilled shrimp) to myself.  Meanwhile my friend loaded up on rice and edamame and drank most of the bottle of chardonnay (in an ice bucket, btw) -- which funny enough made him pretty drunk by the end of dinner.  I really dig this Roy's and Roy's in general.  It reminds me of a fancy version of Kona Grill - more uptown, sedate, but not stuffy either.   And of course, I dig the dramatic entrance to the Marriott Desert Ridge and lofty lobby and staircases.  Very classy, but again -- not stuffy.   The open kitchen is a nice touch.  Something about open kitchens in restaurants always get extra points with me -- suggesting that the restaurant has nothing to hide, perhaps.     I ordered the grilled salmon and ponzu sauce with was grilled perfectly and the sauce giving it added flavor and oomph.  If you're a chocoholic or a dessert person, be sure to order the chocolate lava souffle in advance and save room - supposedly it's out of this world."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood. Try the price fix menu on Mondays and save some cash."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night for a birthday celebration with 3 other couples and spent over $700.  Service was great but the food was terrible.  appetizers were small and overpriced.  We had the calamari, loco moco,  canoe and ribs.   the only appetizer everyone raved about were the ribs but the rest were horrible.  We ordered several entrees including short ribs, butterfish, salmon, pork shank and curried chicken.  Other than the fish entrees, there were alot of leftover foods and no one wanted to take home any because no one wanted to eat any of the food twice.  We skipped desserts, no one wanted to try any.  Drinks were great and again, service was great.   Not a good nor memorable experience at Roy's for us unfortunately."}
{"text":"A great place. Food and staff are both amazing.  Service was on point, knowledgable and courteous. The food did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I am not sure why it took me so long to review Roy's since I have been celebrating special occasions at the restaurant for the past five years. I have yet to have a disappointing experience. The service is consistently strong, staff is always knowledgable and friendly, and the food is amazing.  I usually get the macadamia nut encrusted mahi mahi and it never disappoints.  I love the sushi here as well. I recently celebrated my birthday here and it was such a wonderful experience. Everyone was very pleased with their food and the service. They even offer an alternative menu for the vegeterians among us if you let them know in advance. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic night . . . by the end, if they'd have played the sound of the ocean, I'd have thought I was back in Maui . . .  First off, my bud is fresh off a 7hrs of travelling, I'm in 10hrs of business casual clothes, so we're not exactly looking like high rollers, yet we walk into this palace of a hotel entrance to find everybody friendly and helpful to us.  Which is good, because there's no signs so the restaurant was a bastard to find.  Worth it though  We arrived at 6 on a Wednesday during spring training season, and were immediately seated without reservations.  Was fairly empty, but by 8 when we left it was starting to get packt.  We sat on the beautiful patio with a lazy river nearby, surrounded by palm trees, tropical flora, with tiki torches, space heaters, and a couple of fireplaces that were perfect as the dusk turned to night.  I can't overstate the location enough, it was gorgeous  Ice water and drinks are very quick to arrive, and  a comp plate of spiced edamame is brought out, which really was a nice touch.  Just a cheap little something to nosh, more restaurants should do the same kind of thing.  Service was perfect, and we never felt rushed.  So many places rush, your food comes out like planes landing at O'hare . . . you are only halfway thru your app and the entree arrives . . . not here.  The 5-10 minute break between app and entree was welcomed.  Maybe that's different on a weekday night instead of a table flipping busy weekend night  The meal was fantastic, best I've had since the Tiki Terrace in Maui.  The appetizer sampler was a nice mix and the rock shrimp tempura was very good.  The entree though . . .  the Pecan Crusted Swordfish is fantastic, and have it cooked the way the chef recommends.  I'm not a dessert person, but my buddy had the gluten free lava cake thing, and he may have jizzed in his pants . . . I didn't want to ask  Oh, and yes, my buddy has gluten issues, and he loves their gluten-free menu, so I guess kudos if wheat is slowly trying to kill you.  Anyways, I can't recommend Roys at Desert Ridge enough.  Might have to have a splurge weekend . . . get a room, massage/spa, Roy's . . . with the ocean playing in one ear of my iPod . . ."}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday party.  The staff was amazing, especially Elizabeth.  She was very knowledgeable and had a fabulous personality.   The food was good and the California roll had a unique taste, unlike any I have had before.   They are very accommodating to diet restrictions and make sure you have what you need.   The decor is simple with dim lighting. It's hard to have a conversatioon if you are in a party more than four.   You can see the chefs preparing food. I liked that openness.   They also knew how to make the birthday person feel special with birthday inserts in the menu and a personalized photo. Sort of like an amusement park, but it was very appreciated.   Great venue. Worth going back."}
{"text":"We were staying at the JW Marriott so Roy's was an easy choice and a good one.  We went to Ocean Prime later in the trip and that was $15/person more and not half as good. Beef short ribs were outstanding - you can cut them with a fork they're so tender. Ono was outstanding. The meatloaf, yes meatloaf, was better than any other meatloaf I have ever had (don't tell my Mom). We didn't do happy hour but saw the menu and that looks like a good choice if you aren't looking for a full dinner. Best Roy's location of the several I have dined at."}
{"text":"We usually go to Roy's for espacial occasion . But it is getting now to the point that even my kids are asking to be there once a while not only because they adore their addictive soufflé but they love the food too . Great servers . Very friendly . Respectful .    Big thanks to every one there that can make every visit so special ."}
{"text":"My second visit to Roy's left me impressed once again! They are extremely accommodating to your needs. Service was spectacular and the chef even sent some free items over.. I ordered the kimchi fried rice, Szechuan green beans and scallops for my dinner. Very tasty and presentation was beautiful.. I love eating outside when the weather permits. They have a beautiful fire place and the live music can be heard at the table."}
{"text":"Our flight was delayed and we checked in our hotel at 10 pm. Fortunately Roy's was still serving dinner until 11 pm. Although the restaurant was just an hour  before closing the service and food was superb! The staff didn't rush is and all the entrees were cooked to perfection! The filet mignon and Aleana rib eye were tender and so flavorful. On the side the truffles mac and cheese was delicious."}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets in the East Valley is Roys wine tasting club which meets every third Saturday at 4pm.   They offer a generous taste of four or five different and unique wines plus a lovely plate of Roys appetizers plus a special desert sampler all For $20 for members.   I've been at least five times and have not been disappointed yet. See you there."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service we had the Groupon dinner paid the up fee $10 & $15 to short ribs & fish trio Ahi Salmon and butterfish great  presentation loved it."}
{"text":"While I initially was disturbed by the Los Angeles prices for dining in Phoenix,  i have to say I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Parmesan crusted swordfish was cooked to perfection. The risotto upon which the fish sat was outstanding. I was even pleasantly surprised by the seasoning on the micro green salad served alongside the main course.  The starter salad with creamy herb dressing was fabulous.  Service was impeccable and the restaurant manager visited with us to verify as much.  My dinnermate remarked that the pork katsu was delicious and fried perfectly."}
{"text":"Here for my birthday dinner for this visit. Nice little touches throughout my meal made my dinner extra special.  Like the printed birthday greeting when I opened up my menu, the surprise dessert treat with candle and birthday wishes written on plate. They even took photo of Mr B & I, framed and signed and given as a memento.    OH and dinner! The 3 course Winter Prixe Fix menu. My selections were Duck Confit Dim Sum for the appetizer, Teppanyaki Shrimp for my entree and Mango Cobbler for my dessert. Everything was delicious. It wasn't a \"wow\" but I really enjoyed my meal.  Ambiance and Service A+  This Birthday Girl was happy!"}
{"text":"I had the 12 oz ribeye at Roy's.  I ordered it medium, and it came out way over-charred (burnt) on the outside, and medium-rare in the middle.  I also got sick after eating this meal.  I would give 1 star, but my girlfriend enjoyed the chilean sea-bass.  This place might be good for seafood, but look elsewhere if you want a steak."}
{"text":"Anniversary dinner with Roy and the gang. Perfect evening to dine on the patio, started off with a jalapeño margarita and light salad. Then went all in with the boneless ribeye and wasabi mashed potatoes. The glaze was savory and the steak cooked perfect to a medium rare.   Wife got a seafood sampler plate with butterfish (favorite), salmon (close second) and Mahi Mahi (good but a little too fishy-compared to the others).   Finished with a blood orange cake (shoulda done the souffle, live and learn) which was a little sweeter than I like, but still very enjoyable.   Ben was an awesome server, knew every bit of the menu, and perfectly attentive.  Considering we usually are on a cruise ship somewhere for our anniversary, this made staying home well worth it.  Looking forward to the next time!"}
{"text":"Came here on 10/3 to celebrate with some friends for a promotion.  The service was impeccable.  The food was on point.  It was a bit pricey for the quality of food, though.  It was great they brought out a personalized dessert for the individual who we were there for celebrating their promotion...and a personalized framed photo for a souvenir to take home."}
{"text":"We have been to almost every Roy's in the country. Some of them numerous times! We are always very happy with the quality of the food, our favorite is the butterfish and the hot lava soufflé.    Especially impressed with the Las Vegas Roy's, because of the manager Bryce. There was a promotion in the front of the menu, and we thought it applied to us, and it may not have, but Bryce took care of us anyway because he realized the wording was confusing. It was really excellent his level of customer service, because we have probably spent thousands of dollars at Roy's over the years.  Due to his consideration, we will continue to!"}
{"text":"\"It's just expensive ass Hawaiian BBQ\" hahahaha  Actually it was good.  The service was great though it was terribly slow.  However our waiter made sure that we were taken care of.  Our b-day girl and new grad got extra desserts.  Extra sweets for the sweets are always nice."}
{"text":"We went to Roy's last Tues. nite during in tax convention.  My wife got Groupon and once we got on the Uber we found put it's not actually on the Strip, but close enough. For some reason, they were not busy at all that nite, we ordered the basic entrees, you can see our photos, all in all, they were good.  We decided to get a red glass of wine each, so we took our time to savor every drop. My wife said she went to their franchise restaurant in Hawaii, basically the same. We were so stuffed that we packed home the whole dessert. Service was good & typical for a Vegas joint.  We wouldn't mind returning. The excitement came afterwards we our Uber driver tried to take a back road shortcut back to Rio & ran into a bunch of construction roadblocks."}
{"text":"Call me a less than sophisticated diner. I went on a Wednesday evening alone (in town for CES). I sat at the bar. I ate only appetizers and loved all three:  a shrimp salad, a sushi roll and some prawns. It was a pleasure watching the two sous-chefs and the line cooks do their work. I took time talking to them; they responding in kind. My waiter and servers were polite and engaging. I would recommend this restaurant highly, but it is rather expensive. I have a tough time paying $55 for appetizers and tap water for one. That's the only reason I don't rate Roy's as excellent."}
{"text":"Worst meal and dinning experience in recent memory.  Sat down with 4 colleagues for a business dinner.  Ordered the Maui Shrimp Salad that came with 1 cut up shrimp and half a latex glove that I almost choked on.  The manager only came out after we asked why she hadn't yet.  All other plates came out staggered and cold with zero quality.  The steaks were burnt and the duck was obviously cooked well before I ordered it.  This place is at a JW Marriott?  The kitchen staff should be fired for what they were sending out or the manager for allowing it.  Unbelievable, our entire dinner was finally comped.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have dined at Roy's plenty of times before and have always been very pleased with the food and service.  I'm hoping tonight was just an \"off\" night.  The service was, as it always has been, excellent and friendly, but the food just didn't meet the expectations that we've set for this restaurant.  Their dishes are always flavorful with what seems like minimal ingredients.  Tonight everything tasted like it was depending too much on sauces and salt to carry the flavor.  I don't know if there was a different chef, or the ingredients were cheaper, or what, but it tasted more like a meal we'd get at The Keg or Keegans (and we like those places, but Roy's is much more expensive and had always been worth that extra expense).  We started with the calimari.  The waiter did tell us that they'd changed the recipe slightly since we'd been there.  It was fine, but the previous way it was served was MUCH better, and we told the waiter so.  I had the greens with strawberries and goat cheese and, I swear, I think they actually salted this!  Not that there was salt in the dressing, but actual salt on the greens.  My entree was the butterfish.  It was fine.  Not outstanding, not sublime, just fine.  I've never had a \"just fine\" experience here and didn't finish my meal (also a first!).  My husband had the filet and poached lobster.  He asked for the steak to be cooked medium well and it was easily rare to medium.  It all had a sauce on it that seemed heavier (and served with a heavier hand than usual), so mostly you tasted sauce and not the usual delicious simplicity of the food.  The good news is our dessert, the pineapple upside down cake, was as delicious as it's always been, so the evening wasn't a total loss! :)    I really am curious if anyone else has noticed a difference or this really was an off night.  I'll be watching reviews to see if there's a downward trend.  I really hope not, this was always our favorite special night go-to restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good quite deserving of the ratings here on Yelp.  Very solid overall but nothing so memorable that I have to go back next time I am in Vegas.  Maybe it was the fact that they only receive two shipments of fish per week according to their waitstaff.  As a visitor from the coast, that doesn't inspire me so i got the chicken confit special.  Not the melt in your mouth confit that one would expect.  Papaya salad was good though very light on the papaya which was compensated for with a bold dressing.  the Semi-fredo was very nice and would consider it the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"I had a big group of 11 and they accommodated us without any issue. They were even able to do split checks. Food was amazing! Not too pricey! We were celebrating our 2 friends 21st and they brought out a delicious lime tarte with happy birthday written in chocolate. How cute! Our server Kevin was very polite and overall the restaurant deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite happy hour spot!!  The best food and drink specials around.  The service can be spotty, but only because they get so darned busy for this great happy hour.  I love this place overall.  I am a member of the wine club and used to frequent their wine tastings on Fridays.  Food is great, service in the restaurant is far better than most."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Roys many times in the past. There are a few things that we know we love at this restaurant. My wife ordered the pork ribs and the garlic shrimp ( two appetizers instead of a main course). The ribs are an old favorite of ours it did not fail this time. The meat literally fell off the bone and was incredibly delicious. The garlic shrimp large flavorful and cooked to perfection. I ordered a summer special that they had that included an appetizer, main course and dessert, all for $36. The appetizer was a papaya salad. It had spring mixed greens, peanuts, papaya, and a chili vinaigrette sauce. What a terrific combination  with the papaya adding sweetness and moisture. The peanuts added just the right amount of crunch. The main course was seared shrimp and lemongrass confit chicken. The presentation of the plate was stunning. The seared shrimp were cooked just right. They were juicy and flavorful. The chicken was moist and delicious. There was a coconut milk infused red curry sauce. All of this was accompanied by the baby carrots and grilled scallions. And the service was outstanding. Our server, Tiffany, was very attentive without being overbearing. Overall a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Perfection!  Best meal in Vegas.  First off, great cocktail and wine menu.  We got a Mai Tai and a Stags Leap Cab.  If you love tropical drinks, you've hit the jackpot here.  Good stuff.  For my entree, I had the Trio of Fish.  All three pieces were cooked perfectly.  All were flavorful and fresh.  I love getting small portions of three different items -- variety is the spice of life.  The salad we shared was a nice and light -- full of unique flavors.  The duck flatbread appetizer was our favorite.  Every course was delicious.  No misses!    Service was outstanding!  Everyone took very good care of us.  I guess you could call it the Aloha spirit.    Definitely get off the \"strip\" and have, what I'm sure will be, a memorable meal in Vegas.  You will not be disappointed.    Budget tip:  go for happy hour!  Tropical cocktails and appetizers for $5!!  Also, on Mondays, great prix fixe deal!"}
{"text":"We just ate at Roy's Restaurant and the meal was superb as always. I had the Ahi tuna and my boyfriend had the rib eye. Service was excellent as always!!"}
{"text":"Came back a year later after my last dismal review.  Great news, this visit was a success!   We were seated promptly as we arrived on time for our reservation.  I was surprised the restaurant was not packed given Spring Training, and convention were in town.   The wine list seems paired down since our last visit as there weren't the same number of selections for whites and reds as I remember from the list.  We both ordered various glasses of white wines for first course and entrée. What I was most happy with is Roy's Trio and Classic Four were cooked perfectly.  Too many items on our last visit seemed to be pre-cooked waiting for warming up as items were ordered. Roy's Maui has always rated 5 stars because of better service, better wine list and overall better food execution.  We were there just this past December and no, I don't add the location as a boost for that Roy's. My wife and I will be back and we will see how the next visit goes.  Fingers crossed it will be as good if not better."}
{"text":"Tired of all of the all you can eat/stuff into your stomach buffets, we went to Roy's for their Hawaiian fusion cuisine.   We started off with some appetizers. Lobster California rolls, Haleakala Sunrise rolls and Crispy wok fried calamari. I wasn't quick enough for the Haleakala rolls, but the Lobster California rolls were very good. The calamari could have been better.   Roasted corn and sweet potato chowder was excellent. The corn kernels were tender, sweet and crisp. A sweet and warm soup for the soul.   My entree was the Hawaii Kai beef short ribs. Very tender beef with a sweet soy sauce marinade, topped with bits of onion and red pepper made for a tasty dish.   Finally dessert was Haupia creme puffs. The Haupia, a coconut pudding, had a very subtle flavor. i would have preferred a stronger coconut flavor and something sweeter.   The service was excellent. The downside was the tastiness of a couple of the dishes."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! Angie, our server, was very, very friendly and very well informed! In fact, all the servers were great! They even made my girlfriend's birthday extra special! Definitely recommend to anyone who likes seafood, especially on special occasions. Thank you for a great evening!"}
{"text":"I would give Roy's Zero stars if possible.  The $41 Ribeye was like shoe leather.  Simply awful.  The mash potatoes were like soup.  The service was not much better.  Take your money across the street to an establishment on Main Street."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!  On a whim, I randomly made a reservation for one of the last nights of our Vegas trip, and I'm so, so glad that I decided to listen to the many raving reviews already on Yelp.  The food was delicious, the service was great, the prices were fair (especially since we went with their Monday pre-fixe menu special). I ordered the wagyu beef sushi roll appetizer to start, and it was probably one of my all-time favorite rolls of sushi I've ever had. Sooooo good. And our entrées and dessert were just as good, too.  We will definitely be coming back to Roy's next time we're in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"First time here tonight.   Wanted to use my $25 gift card American Express sent me.  Arrived right at opening,  no reservation,  seated immediately.  The waiters assistant was amazing.   Don't think my iced tea ever got to half empty.  The waiter was another story.   He seemed very rushed although I think I was his only table.  After the food was delivered,  I never saw him again until after his assistant had cleared the plates.  The food was another story.   I ordered the sword fish off the Chef's Creations menu and the green beans.   I've never had sword fish that was so tender.  It was delicious.  The star of the meal for me was the szechuan green beans. They were flavored with what looked like small slices of Andouille sausage.  Crispy tender and perfectly spiced.   I would consider ordering the larger size for an entrée.  Would probably have been a 5-Star  rating with another server."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and service; their menu changes quarterly but will often improvise off the old menu if you request it. Also the steak is the same quality as Flemings for about half the cost"}
{"text":"I'm really torn about this one, so let's start here. That was literally the worst piece of fish that I have ever been served. Last year I was in Honolulu for my birthday and my wife and I had an amazing dinner at Roy's. When my wife found a Roy's here in Arizona, she thought that it would be a nice surprise for my birthday this year. We were greeted and promptly sat at a table that had a place card wishing me a happy birthday (very nice touch.) We ordered drinks and ordered. I had tuna poke and my wife had lobster dumplings. Both were fantastic and got my hopes up for the entree. My wife had a filet and I ordered the macadamia nut mahi mahi. My wife's filet was spot on although the whipped potatoes and veg were pedestrian. My mahi on the other hand was terrible. I know, I live hundreds of miles from fresh fish but still. The mahi was cooked until every molecule of water was cooked out. Not only did the fish not flake, it turned into dust (that might be a slight exaggeration but still, it was dry as this god forsaken desert that I live in.) The complimentary birthday dessert was a nice touch and the flourless chocolate cake was great.  Service was good but I'm not sure that it was $75 per person good (no steak knife until my wife had finished and my wife's dessert was served 15 minutes after mine.) I would have to say that my night would have been better at the bar just eating appetizers and dessert."}
{"text":"The  outside patio would get 5 stars as would our waiter who was excellent but sadly that is where the excellence stopped.  My husband and I have been enjoying going to Roy's over several years in several different states as we travel. We had reservations for 6pm but arrived early for aloha hour. The drinks were watered down with no hint of alcohol. These are the same cocktails we have gotten over the years at different locations and they were disappointing. I ordered the braised ribs which were good but not amazing.  The vegetable roll was great. I was very disappointed especially after eating dinner at Roy's in San Fransisco two months ago which was an extraordinary experience. If we did not have the experience of eating at Roy's for many years and have grown to have a higher expectation (for our $200+ tab) than this location may have gotten higher ratings."}
{"text":"To begin, as opposed to the other reviews posted here, Joshua our server was fine. I'm sure he did everything within his power to improve this less than mediocre dining experience. To begin with when we were seated there was a dirty leftover napkin in the seat, from there it was downhill. The calamari was just bad...thin over-breaded and tasteless. The lobster bisque was just watery and weird but it looked nice. The wedge salad was fine, in fact it saved the night, because we both ordered the grilled salmon which was over cooked to the point of dry and not very tasty at all. That annoyed me because I love fresh Atlantic Salmon it's a rare delicacy on the East Coast. All of the items were warm at best and the final insult will present itself in the form of a bill that far exceeds the value of the meal you received. If I'd known the cost was that excessive we would've returned to \"Ocean Prime\" that review is pending. Save your time, tastebuds, and money by researching a better location to eat. Sorry Roy's you're my 2018 Phoenix fail."}
{"text":"I love Roy's! I am addicted to the Hawaiian Islands and I can go to Roy's to get a brief Hawaii fix. I escape Vegas to Hawaii for an hour without the plane ride by just coming to Roy's for dinner.    I love the Butterfish 5/5 quite possibly the best entree on the menu.  Other stand outs include the Blackened Ahi and the Scallops."}
{"text":"First and foremost service in this restaurant is amazing.  I opted to sit at the bar and the bartender, Matt, was excellent.  He provided a really good run down of the menu and zeroed in on great recommendations given my appetite.    I chose the weekday prix fixe ... Which was a ton of food for a really good price.  For the price of any entree you get a three course meal.  The shrimp dumpling appetizer was okay, not great but tasty.  The alternative \"surf n turf\" with prawns and pork loin was bleeping deliciousness in my mouth.  The plate was beautiful and everything (absent the cold tomato side) had a purpose on the plate.  I would come back again and again just for that dish.    I was so full I had to grab the dessert to go... It made a spectacular breakfast ;)"}
{"text":"We ate at Roy's last night and it was absolutely superb. I choose the surf and turf, the filet was so tender and cooked to perfection. The lobster tail was so succelent and fresh I just wish I had left overs. For once we decided to go without the amazingly rich choclate soffle desert, when it was time we wished that we had ordered it. The Staff is always pleasant and there are so many wonderful dishes to choose from, my ultimate favorite is the misoyaki butterfish with the forbidden black rice. Yes it is a little pricey but well worth it. they have a great happy hour and a prefix menu which allows for most to get a taste of the wonderful food they have without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"party of seven, we arrive on time, and are pleasantly treated, and seated right away.  Our service was perfect all night.  The ambiance was warm and comfortable.  We had the sampler appetizer plate, and it was delicious.  I had the marinated hawaiian fish, and the pineapple upside down cake.  Everybody commented how great the service and meal was.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I Had some Braised Short Ribs of Beef. A bit Saucy, My friend had the steak which was covered in sauce as well. The food was different than normal high end establishments but good nevertheless. A bit on the pricey side and I would suggest going light on the sauce."}
{"text":"It is a rare restaurant that doesn't misstep at all, and this is definitely one.  I was doing a sales type dinner, so I looked on Yelp for a good restaurant - Roy's popped up - just around the corner from the office and rated highly.  Without knowing anything, the plan was laid.  The dinner started with edemame - nicely steamed (but a little over-cooked in my opinion - still very good), covered in a mix of salt and sweet - brown sugar, perhaps?  Definitely delicious.  Then we ordered the Roys Canoe Appetizer and a Lobster California Roll.  I highly recommend the Szechuan Pork Ribs off the Canoe, but everything was excellent.  The ribs got more than one complement.  Our main courses were mostly from the sea.  I had the chicken breast of the night which came with bacon gravy and sweet potato puree.  The sweet potato puree was sweet, but the bacon gravy more than made up for it.  I mean, honestly, how can you go wrong with bacon gravy?  The other main courses all got good reviews.  On to dessert and coffee.  One of my dining companions opted for the pineapple upside down cake, and the other for pumpkin cheesecake.  When they came out, they were works of art - comments like \"it's a shame to eat it\", but they managed it anyway, and commented on how delicious they were.  The cappuchinos around the table were also savored.  Through it all, we had some of the best service I have encountered.  It wasn't obtrusive, but there was always someone close by to assist.  My only complaint (and its common among a lot of restaurants) is that when asked for a recommendation, waitstaff always point to the most expensive thing on the menu.  Either that or they go the marginally less informative route of saying 'well, everything is good'.  Seriously guys - you need to step up and say what YOU like."}
{"text":"BRUNCH!!!   We stopped at Roy's last Saturday for lunch, but learned they had a brunch menu.  What a pleasant surprise!  I went in craving my favorite dish (Misoyaki Butterfish), but decided to try the Shoyu Charred Rib Eye with sunny side-up egg, housemade kimchi and short rib hash. WOW! The rib eye was delicious, but that was expected; what wasn't expected was the kimchi and the short rib hash - both were absolutely to-die-for!  We also ordered the Roy's Benedict with Filet Mignon - again, the filet was delicious, but what stood out were the cheddar bacon biscuits and the Shiso Bernaise.  My dad ordered the Lobster and Shrimp omelet, which he said was excellent. (Side note: I was extremely impressed by the perfectly-uniform brunoise knife cuts on the omelet dish.)  Kudos to the management, Chef, kitchen staff and our server, Eric, for doing fine-dining correctly! .  Roy's is now my favorite brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Service very good.  Ambience excellent.  Food is good but not great.  Food needs to match the price.  I change my 3 stars to 5 stars regarding happy hour though.   Happy hour is one of the best around."}
{"text":"Outstanding service. Came here after the Yelp Olympics elite event and didnt change into street clothes just stayed in gym attire. The staff didnt treat us like we werent welcome, in fact we got the same respect as others dressed in clubbing attire.   At first the menu looks a tad on the pricey side but the food is well worth it.  Appetizers  - Panko Crusted Calamari - Recommended by our server. Not a traditional Calamari with deep fried squid goodness served next to some tomato based sauce, this variation of Calamari comes lightly breaded, deep fried, and tossed in a sweet orange sauce with a mild vinegar tang. Absolutely delicious.  Salads  - Maui Wowie -  10 bucks for a salad? Better be the best salad ever... Yeah it's really good. The caper lime dressing wasnt too rich but wasnt too light either, it was perfectly balanced and gave each ingredient enough room to pronounce itself. Sweetness of the shrimps compliment the salad very nicely.  Entrees  - Roy's Trio -  Beautifully arranged on the three tiered plate this trio of fish is well worth the price. The salmon was cooked perfectly and had a very pleasant grilled flavor. The tuna's butter sauce was...DAMN!! The best part was the Misoyaki Butterfish, tender with lots of flavor."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Roy's yesterday. After reading all the reviews, we thought we were set for an amazing experience. The place has a nice ambience, but really - this is not the best place. The staff were ok, but when cleaning off the table and serving they lean over you in a very imposing manner. Have they not learned how to serve a guest? We had some sushi for starters. I must say the food was good, but was only provided knife and fork?  We were a bigger party, but I personally tried the butterfish and my girlfriend the Opah. Butterfish was ok, but seemed like something was missing. The Opah was dry (very dry). They promised a moist and good fish, but both got at best an average food experience. Actually fairly disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been to other Roy's locations and crowed about the one in Chandler.  Wanted to try the Prix Fixe menu and took a friend who lives nearby as my guest.  Despite the waterside outdoor tables and attentive adjunct serving staff, this location didn't do it for me.  Our shrimp and papaya appetizer was fabulous, my dining companion's chicken with jasmine rice and red curry was adored by his palate, but I found my hanger steak wanting.  It's a very flavorful cut of beef but it was overcooked from my requested medium rare, and the presentation was monochromatic.  Brown beef on brown sauces with purple sweet potato fries (which means they darken externally to a brown black after frying) in a black ramekin, covering up the sauteed or grilled? fresh garlic stems that are akin to scallions.  One expects a pop of color on a plate from Roy's, and this one did nothing to whet my appetite.  The dessert was lovely, we both opted for the bread pudding with macerated strawberries.  Our server was amiable and the adjunct staff such as hostess and the food runners were attentive, but our server had lapses and the beverages took longer than usual to arrive.  This might seem like so much harping over nothing, but when you are being charged five dollars to park after validation for the privilege of eating at a location, you expect the service level to be ramped up on every detail.  Lastly, I don't know if it was attributable to the resort location, but I thought that thirteen bucks  for a signature cocktail was a wee bit excessive.  Maybe I seem petty, but it is my money.  My server was tipped in excess of 23% or thereabouts, I was still kind to him, but overall I've had a better experience in more pedestrian Roy's locations."}
{"text":"I first became aware of Roy and his restaurants four years ago while watching season 2 of \"Top Chef.\"  At the time I was planning my first visit to Hawaii, and I was specifically avoiding Oahu and making a beeline for the Big Island so the final competitions on the Big Island captured my fancy.  Roy was a major judge in the competition.  The loss of my job nearly four years ago caused a major shift in priorities for me, as in no more trips to Hawaii anytime soon. Ditto for dining on haute cuisine.   Somehow I stumbled onto the website for Roy's and learned about the Aloha menu.  With a five dollar price ceiling for drinks and food, I reckoned I could once again sample food that was the culinary equivalent of transcendence without feeling guilty about the expenditure afterwards. So, I cajoled my meat and potatoes Midwestern beau into taking me to Roy's for an early light meal and cocktails.  From the moment we walked in the door, everything was perfect and professional- very professional. I should know, once upon a time I made my living in haute cuisine restaurants. I've always said it's easy to find great food for a commensurate price, the trick is getting great food without a hefty pricetag. Aloha hour at Roy's affords a person such as myself the opportunity to experience innovative cuisine and cocktails without forfeiting a necessity of life such as electricity for a month.  Getting back to the staff, we were greeted and treated as if we had arrived in a limo instead of a Tundra. Once seated in the bar for Aloha hour we were not subjected to thinly veiled contempt from the server who realized that the tab was not going to merit the same gratuity as a several course meal.  The hostess, our server, and the manager on duty were  all extremely cordial, polite and provided seamless service and even better food.    The original hawaiian martini I ordered was prepared with top shelf liquors, not cheap substitutes to reflect the reduced price.  We loved the salt and pepper calamari, Waygu sliders, potstickers, and the sushi rolls with a spin.  For a fraction of the price of the average degustation menu we sampled the gamut of appetizers and several drinks- well, I had several drinks, not the driver.  As for ambiance, we were seated at a banquette adjacent to a very large marine fish aquarium.  The atmosphere was subdued, urbane, comfortable and the staff was attentive, accommodating, and knowledgeable. Since we were on a date at the time, the server offered to take our photo. It was presented to us in a paper frame shortly afterward.  That is a ready indicator of the staff's desire to go above and beyond percentage-motivated tasks for guests.    Kudos to Roy for bringing the true spirit of Aloha to the mainland along with his unique fushion cusine in a sophisticated atmosphere that reflects warmth and the highest level of professional service for guests regardless of the bottom line at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Every bite was simply amazing .... from the chardonney to the Lobster roll appetizer to the filet mignon to the chocolate souffle.     It was top notch and 5 star.   The hotel grounds are stunning and deserve a little walk through after dinner.  Perfect setting for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"I will say that Roy's is by far my favorite place to eat. I constantly recommend people to dine here and they are always happy tummies as well! The service is always so lovely and very knowledgeable . The steaks are beautifully done. And the Lobster pot stickers!! I crave them more often that i should!"}
{"text":"Seriously, a fantastic dining experience. We sat outside on the beautiful patio, and I ordered Ono. It was cooked perfectly, temperature was Great, and the wasabi sauce that went along with it was incredible. The spring rolls and the fresh asparagus were also top-notch.  It's been a while since I've been to a restaurant and everything about my meal was excellent!"}
{"text":"My only complaint is the quantity to price. I got the special of the day. Some sort of halibut. It just seemed very plain.   I had a few scallops from my sister's plate they tasted great. I am more than willing to go back try something else asked modify my review."}
{"text":"Came for NYE, it was very busy and we sat a little later than our reservations but we were able to sit at the bar for a bit.  Once seated the service was outstanding, it was a crazy busy night and the staff all worked very well together.  The food was very good, although the ceviche appy was very small and in my opinion not worth getting, the others dining with me had the soft shell crab and they were delicious.  The Hot and Sour soup was a bit spicy but so tasty.  The entrees all great as well.  We were all given $20 to return in the next few weeks, we will go back for sure to take advantage of that."}
{"text":"I love Roy's.  I have been to this one and the one is Scottsdale 4 times now.  I like the Chandler location a lot more.  Inside they are both really nice, but the Scottsdale one is located in an upscale shopping center and it felt a tad odd to go to dinner as all the other places were closing.  Every time I have dined at Roy's, I have ordered off the Prix Fixe menu which is a steal for such quality food.  The seafood is excellent and my fiancee who doesn't care for a lot of seafood always finds something she loves.  The waitstaff is amazing and the chocolate lava cake finished off every meal nicely.  Get the mojitos.... they are amazing!"}
{"text":"Oh Roy's I always forget how delicious you are!  I've been to my share of Roy's restaurants (Michigan, Florida, Nevada...) and I can't believe I have never written a review!  Start with the calamari and end with the melting hot chocolate soufflé.  I PROMISE YOU WON'T BE SORRY!  They have an excellent Prix Fixe Menu that changes with the season and it was very \"autumn\" right now so nothing caught our eyes.  But if you see that you like it- its the best price way to go!  So, here is what we had: - Panko Crisped Calamari - Lakanilau (sushi you will NOT find anywhere else!!) - Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi (x 2 as my husband had it as well!) - Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé  My husband and I are calamari snobs, if you will, because we love calamari and we always like to try it at various places.  Roy's definitely turned into our favorite.  So you know when you order calamari at places and you get the rings and something like looks like the claws?  I hate the \"claw\" looking pieces.  Well at Roy's- no rings and no \"claws\"!  They are just perfect, meaty pieces of calamari, perfectly cooked with a perfect coating of panko.  They come with a delicious chili glaze & Yuza ailoi.  We could have eaten that as our main course!  The Lakanilau has wagyu beef, snow crab, asparagus, avocado, sesame miso and truffled greens.  I am like only the only person in the world that has JUST RECENTLY (like in the past 3 weeks!) tried sushi.  And I loved it!  Nothing too crazy though.  This was the \"craziest\" I have tried.  And its not even crazy!  But I have never seen this on another menu and it was VERY good!  The wagyu beef was insane!  I've had the Macadamia nut crushed mahi mahi a many times at Roy's and its my favorite thing.  Its a VERY generous piece of mahi mahi with asparagus and a few potatoes. Yum!  I know i'm not going into great detail, but I'm sure its gotta be one of the most popular items on the menu.    Now, if you leave Roy's without trying the Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé, you need to be slapped.  I'm not kidding.  This is my favorite part of the dinner, even though everything else is fabulous.  You need to tell your server (they usually ask when you are placing your order) that you will want the chocolate soufflé.  The soufflé has this melting chocolate part in the middle, that when it comes to the table, you need to break it open and have it ooze over the vanilla bean ice cream and the raspberry sauce.  All of these flavors do a beautiful dance on your tongue and you will be smiling the entire time you are eating it.  My parents used to sit at the bar, so they could watch the chefs making the dinners, sushi and soufflé and they always said it was the best part of their dinner.  The dinner ran us about $150, including two glasses of wine, but it was well worth the price for this incredible dinner.  Total side note: My cousin was a manager at an Outback in Hawaii and Roy's was the only other restaurant on the island.  Roy was always there and he said how nice and down to earth guy Roy was.  Knowing that, makes me want to eat there even more!  When they seat you, they ask if you are celebrating a special event.  And here's why: when it's someone's birthday (I think there were 3 there last night!) they bring out a dessert and take the table's photo.  Before you leave, then bring it out in Roy's frame for you to take home.  Pretty cool!  Great food & great fusion!  Nom nom nom!!!"}
{"text":"Every once in a while, I would indulge on a classy restaurant and I'm happy to say I picked a very good one with Roy's. No, I've never been in Hawaii, and yes, I like fish, so how can I not be tempted.  True to the word about Hawaiian hospitality, I felt welcome and accommodated by the staff throughout the entire meal. Bonus point for our waiter too for her recommendation and also for knowing her stuff about the ingredients on our dish. For our entrees, I had my fish and my companion had duck, Hawaiian-Asian fusion it is. Three delectable portion of fish meat called Roy's Classic Trio (mahi mahi, salmon, and butterfish) tastefully decked with rich sauces adorned my long three hollow plate. It goes with flavored rice, and whew, I can't even describe how heavenly it satisfies my palate. My friend's well done duck breast, contrary to the chef's recommended medium cooked, is texturally juicy. Prepare to spend on the mid-range price but every bite is worth it.  There were two dinner functions when we were there so the noise level was kind-a up, other than that, I think it is a cozy place for a date night. Will ask for a booth on my next visit and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Another fabulous evening at our favorite place to dine!  Spent Valentine's Eve enjoying a delicious family dinner with our favorite professional waiter, Tim.  The food is always fantastic and cooked perfectly.  Tim is always spot-on with his food and wine recommendations.  Our 10-year-old daughter even tried something new off the keiki's menu this time (short ribs) and LOVED it!"}
{"text":"What kind of restaurant closes in Las Vegas at 9:15 PM on a Friday night?  I tried to make reservations at 9:30 PM and they said they were closed.  Truly unreal, there are far better places open until 11 PM or as late as 24 hours to consider!  Wayne Gorsek"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to dine at Roy's and the only chain restaurant I consider a favorite. The servers have always been well versed with the menu and the kitchen has been very accommodating on substitutions if asked. Roy's really is the best Pacific rim restaurant in the Phoenix area. At times the bar patrons can become a little loud and filter into the dining area, but the overall atmosphere is upper end. Always make sure to have a reservation, if wanting to sit in dining area, as they run to capacity most of the time and will turn away patrons or offer the bar without a reservation."}
{"text":"Aloha!  I have to say, my experience tonight at Roy's was pretty fantastic.  Service was great.  The bar was quiet and not too full.  A menu full of unique Hawaiian inspired cocktails to choose from and wine and beer all for $5.  Six different, all delicious, $5 appetizers to choose from including lobster pot stickers, sliders w/sweet potato fries, beef skewers, ahi tuna roll, salt and pepper calamari, and one more lobster one . . . I forget.  The calamari and sliders w/fries were my favorite.  This is a great place to go when you want a good happy hour, but aren't looking for the crowded, busy spots.  This was a great place to eat, drink, and catch up on conversation.    While we were lingering around waiting for our friends and after finishing our food, our server was great about checking in, but not too much.  Making sure we didn't miss happy hour, but not pressuring us either.  Never felt rushed or that we were putting her out by trying to get one more appetizer in just under the wire.  And the drinks were great!  Normally, the fruity drinks don't appeal to me.  But with names like Basil Cucumber Collins, or Cilantro Cucumber Margarita, Pineapple Ginger Mojito, Lemongrass Sake-tini, (the list goes on and on) I couldn't resist.  AND, the wine was great, had a glass of the Malbec.  BF liked his beer.  Oh, and all of this Aloha goodness . . . DAILY . . . 4:30-6:30!  Nice!  Mahalo, Roy's!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Where do I start?  The mai tais?  The ono?  The lobster potstickers?  Everything was so delicious.  We were celebrating a special occasion and we got a card and several \"drive-by\" congratulations from staff.    Be forewarned that this place is spendy.  It's also an \"experience\" aside from just having dinner.  Although we haven't done their Aloha hour in a while, it's a super deal. If you don't feel like dropping some cash on dinner, do Aloha hour.  It's an excellent value and is a great preview of their entrees."}
{"text":"Had great dinner here with my hubby. Did not make it to Roy's on Maui so we decided to try local.  We started with the calamari. Slightly overdone, not bad but the Thai basil dipping sauce was delish. We split a roasted beet salad. It had both red and golden beets (a fav), toasted mac nuts and a bright citrus vinaigrette. Loved it! Hubby throughly enjoyed his Choppino and I had the shellfish mixed platter. I had melt in your mouth butter poached lobster, scallops done to med. rare (now how often do you get asked how done you want your shellfish?) perfection and perfectly grilled shrimp over a delightful macadamia pesto asparagus risotto.  Darcie our waitress and her assistant were friendly and provided excellent service. Look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Went here with my bestie. They were super awesome about finding us a seat in about 10 minutes even though we were about 30 minutes early on our reservation. So love the fire torches on the exterior, the inside is cozy.  I ordered a Baramundi Special, he ordered a Shell Fish Assortment. Great food, super hot waiter... HEY.... ok he was hot and did a great job... so eye candy was a bonus, food and decor were great... LOL"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE:  They made our anniversary so special.  My menu had \"Happy Anniversary\", the fruit desert with our names in chocolate was so special.  All of the staff that came to our table wished us a happy anniversary and got  a picture of us to take home as well.   SERVICE:  Excellent.  Staff was friendly and helpful. FOOD:  Potstickers were amazing.  I had the short rib, i don't know why but i expected more of s weetish hawaiian flavor but it was good.  Husband had the opa and loved it.  Desert was pineapple cake and it was soooooo good.  Just wish there was more of that.   PRICE:  Worth every penny.  With apps, cocktails, desert and two entrees, was just over $100.   Wish they had these restaurants near me.  I'd go every year."}
{"text":"Definitely had my hopes set high for the price points on the menu and decor.  Made a reservation, arrived early by a few minutes,  and still was asked by three different people my name and if I had a reservation.  To top. It off they all were within three steps of each other,  led to a table by a girl with blonde hair that needed to be brushed.    Ordered appetizers, entrees, dessert. The summer sangria was awesome, really nice drink, well mixed.  Appetizers came out, decent presentation but NO PLATES .....glazed ribs too messy to eat over myself or the cloth table cover. Just was awkward trying to eat until finally flagged someone down.   Hand cut sirloin with corn/chile mash potatoes. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it was cooked, nicely seasoned.... Mash was a nice bold flavor contrast.   Teppanyaki shrimp.... BLAH.  Shrimp were 30-40 size and tasted and looked like they came out of a bag of imported frozen shrimp from Walmart. Bland and severely disappointing. Fried rice was mushy and bland again, like a Bird's Eye microwave bag of rice and vegetables.   Dessert.... Molten chocolate lava cake with ice cream and raspberry cheese cake.... Might serve the same thing at Red Robin.   I would have hoped for an island dessert, something more related to the \"Hawaiian\" menu.   Doubt will ever go back.  I think some may think I'm crass but for $100 for two people it should have been somewhat a special experience."}
{"text":"Saturday I attended one of their cooking classes given by Chef Patrick \" Red\". I have attended a few wine events in the past as well as dine here semi regularly. this was the first cooking class I attended and I thought it was awesome. Chef Patrick demonstrated how to make 3 dishes, the class also included each of the items in full portion size. Not only did I love the dishes, I learned a few techniques that could be useful for any type of cooking. I am really glad I went, the food was excellent, the price was fair and Chef Red did a great job. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My family and I dined at Roy's last night. Wonderful experience from start to finish. I made the Rez online and indicated that it was my husband and Sister-in-laws' birthdays. We were seated at our table and found birthday cards for both!! SO nice! Our server as well as busser were fantastic! (I've worked in fine dining for 17 years so I'm definitely a tough critic!)   We had the Prawn app, wagyu beef and crab roll and sunrise roll. All amazing!  We had the short ribs, fish sampler, butterfish and scallops and all were amazing!  TWO complimentary key lime (I think) desserts that were awesome as well as Chocolate lava cake and an amazing pineapple upside down cake!  Start to finish a wonderful night! Thank you Roy's! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I received a $25 gift card for Roy's Restaurant.  It expired on April 30, 2015. I called on May 3, 2015 and asked if they would still honor the card and they said no.  They already received the money so why not honor a card that expired only 3 days before?  This was a very poor decision by the management. I certainly will not buy any more gift cards or dine at this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"We started at the Bar for happy hour. It was so slow, and our lobster potsitckers were slower, the server noticed how long it took, ran back to the kitchen and got them out. The music was on mute as well as the TV's, which the bar tender was glued to, at 5:30pm Sunday.   With that being said, Wow, our server Kat turned it around! The three course Keiki set up is awesome, and even though we had to send back the Opaka (tail cut and over cooked/ dry), and Scallops (seared raw, with my wife being pregnant) the second chance was cooked to perfection. The desert round was spectacular with a beautiful Keiki Ice cream sunday with my daughters name written in chocolate and a big happy birthday written in Hawaiian for me. They really won us over with how they treated my daughter..   The busser was a little bro/bra-ish, but its a Hawaiian place, he asked \"how was everything\" and every time he filled up water, which could mean anything. This was a little annoying, because some of our food was a little off as stated above.    Thank you Cat, the service was Excellent."}
{"text":"Yummy!  A little on the pricey side for what you get which isn't surprising since this is in the jw.  I thought it was strange that I was offered a table at the chefs bar first despite staying in the hotel.  When our table was ready after waiting for 10-15 minutes, we saw that there were plenty of tables and that the chef's table was literally like sitting at a bar.  I was glad that they seated us at another table immediately upon request but it was a strange start.  We had the appetizer canoe for two and the chicken satay was absolutely delicious!  The beef ribs were also excellent but I didn't care for the spicy tuna or the lobster dumplings.  For dinner, we had the mixed plates of the surf and turf and the shellfish.  It was yummy but nothing compared to the pineapple upside down cake.  Remember to order that ahead of time as it takes a while to prepare just like the soufflé."}
{"text":"We order short ribs appetizer, it took one hour,when they came the were so dry it wasn't worth eating. One person in party of 5 order the filet, half of it was good the other half you couldn't even chew. After  two in half hours we got free dessert that wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Ok, I'll admit it our family has been a fan of Roy Yamaguchi for years.  We eat at the Kahana location as the big dinner of our family trip.  When Hubby and I saw that we were staying right next door to this location, it was a no brainier.  So being familiar with nummy stuff on the menu.....appetizers all around! Ribs, spring rolls, pot stickers.  All well-paced, hot, yummy.  I have a weakness for the ribs and they are a treat; good spice level, nice tooth, well-seasoned. Our waiter was happy to realize we visit other Roy's and we talked locations and recipes.  Kind of like going to a place you've already visited. For dessert, Hubby had a pineapple cake to die for.  I had the chocolate lava cake, which is really like chocolate porn.  Eat it, roll in it, either way is good. All in all, a nice dinner at Roy's is a very tough act to follow."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to a Roy's (first was in L.A.).  Both times I've been treated to dinner, so it's kinda hard to give negative feedback on a free meal, but for the sake all my fellow yelpers, I have to say that if I was paying, I'd be disappointed.  On this most recent visit I asked the waiter about the scallops and was told there were six served over risotto, but only four arrived on my dish and to tell you the truth it's a small portion for the price, so I brought this to the attention of my server and was provided with two more, but the point is that it's just not that satisfying for the price.  I mean I'll be back because I still have a couple of free coupons for appetizers and drinks from the L.A. visit where they messed up our groups order.  Has Roy's gotten too big too quickly? I mean there are 34 locations in less than 20 years, you have to give something up when you grow that quickly."}
{"text":"I highly recommend taking Roy's cooking class. It's for all ranges of cooking abilities and the highly sophisticated cook will learn a ton. You watch Chef cook and eat courses. (Enough food for two meals!)"}
{"text":"The first time been here for Valentine and my birthday, Kim was really nice , professional and helpful, Food was  amazing, services were amazing!!  I had a great time here."}
{"text":"Go here. Now. It's that good. I went here with my wife for a late dinner. We were seated promptly and attended to right away. For an appetizer I had there calamari which tasted fresh and prepared excellently with a nice sauce. I ordered the honey-mustard garlic charred beef short ribs and they blew me away. They were excellent. I just wish there were more of them. Not that the portions were small but I wanted to gorge myself on this treat."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and don't have much recollection of our first visit, but it was enough to make us want a second one.   We came in for the second time on 5/9/15 to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, and Mother's Day. The food was good, but our server was a bit awkward and pushy, which I was not fond of.   I asked him if the lobster bisque risotto was more of a full dish of risotto, or if the risotto was merely a side--he responded by telling me all about the Ono fish. I had to ask my question again and he still wasn't getting it. I did end up ordering the dish and he said that I should have the fish cooked medium, I responded that, \"Unfortunately, I cannot have any undercooked food because I am pregnant and it's not safe for the baby. I need it well done please.\" Again he insisted that the chef recommends it only cooked to medium, and I became very frustrated at this point and told him, \"I don't care what the chef recommends. I'm pregnant and cannot eat it unless it's well done.\"  If I have to tell you TWICE of my consumption needs and you still don't get it and insist on me eating it a different way, I'm not happy. Under normal circumstances, I would love to have sushi or medium-cooked fish instead of a well-done filet. But when I tell you I'm pregnant, stop trying to force a piece of food down my throat that could make me sick and possibly terminate my pregnancy!!!   Also, the risotto was severely undercooked--I love risotto and pastas to be Al dente, as they're meant to, but this was completely raw grains of rice in some areas.   5/19/15 UPDATE: After posting my review, I was promptly contacted by managers from the restaurant to discuss the issues we had, which translated into better informing employees about sensitivity with pregnant womens' diets and not trying to force undercooked food on them. We were also sent a very generous giftcard to give the restaurant another try, which we will. The service we've received from the management staff has earned them another \"star\" in my rating"}
{"text":"In general, I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants.  However, I have been to many Roy's around the country, and I have enjoyed them all.  This particular Roy's stands out and is by far the BEST of them all!  They have a good menu and the food is always well prepared.  What puts this Roy's over the top is the exceptional and personalized service.  They really go out of their way to make you feel like a welcomed and valued guest.  The waiter made a few recommendations, which we didn't particularly enjoy, so after talking with us they immediately brought us something else that we absolutely loved.  This is a great example of really taking care of the customer and ensuring they have a positive experience.  I was very impressed, and I know that I will be returning to this Roy's when I am back in PHX."}
{"text":"Great service by Chad.  Quinoa Salad, Rib Appetizer, Goat Cheese stuffed Squash blossoms were awesome.  Prix Fix Entrees were ok . Bone-in chicken? Really.  the crusted pork was salty.  The Chocolate Souflee is the real deal awesome.  Pass on the Green Tea cake.  Had we ordered 2 different entrees here, our experience would have been better.  Great Mai Tai :-)"}
{"text":"I was taken here for my birthday and it was one of the most memorable dining experiences I've ever had.   Upon driving into the establishment the decor (tiki flames, spacing available for valet etc) was absolutely gorgeous and well thought out.   Everyone from the busser, waiter, to the hostess was warm inviting and so charming. The waitress, was honestly one of the best waitresses I've ever had. She was so genuine and kindly welcoming. Everything she did from the beginning to end was absolutely flawless.   This was all before we even began to eat, and we were already impressed. We were listed specialities and suggestions and from those I chose the trio fish plate. Which practically melted in my mouth.   Roy's has definitely perfected the art of creating the an experience for the guest. If they know it's your birthday - all the wait staff that pass by will say happy birthday to you. They gave us free dessert and a framed picture that came as a surprise.   On a separate occasion, I took my father here as well for his birthday and the experience was paralleled. I highly highly recommend Roy's for the upscale fine dining experience!"}
{"text":"the quality of and consistency of the food at the location is on par with other locations we've dined at.  my favorite location is still the anaheim location for it's decor and service. overall a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Have been to several locations numerous times for lunch and dinner. This review is for Aloha hour at the Las Vegas location. As with the other locations, service was excellent. Special mention to Stephanie and Krissy.   For the Aloha hour appetizers, I had the following: * Beef short rib tacos - excellent * Lobster potstickers  - not the way I remember it in Anaheim but very good nevertheless * Big Island ebi roll - this one is just alright LOL. Just kidding, this was my favorite that I had 2 orders of it * Chocolate Souffle' - you know, I must say this is not bad but I like Citrus City Grill's version better (check out my CCG reviews).  Overall, I enjoyed it a lot, recommend coming here for Aloha hour and intend to come back for dinner because I haven't had the Misoyaki Butterfish in a while and it's definitely calling my name :-)."}
{"text":"I'm very shocked this restaurant has 4.5 stars!! I went to Roy's in Oahu, Hawaii with my boyfriend last summer and it was amazing!! Therefore, when deciding on a restaurant for New Years Eve with my boyfriend and parents, I thought Roy's would be an excellent option. Roy, was I wrong!! Upon arriving at our table, they told us it was a four course only option for that night. It would've been nice to know that when I booked the reservation four days in advance. Our party of four ended up sending 3 dishes back to the kitchen! I typically don't send dishes back because I don't want to be rude, but I had no choice in this instance. The kitchen is open to the restaurant floor and there were constantly managers inspecting each dish and personally delivering them to each table. That's why I am surprised that the food was not good at all. Great service, but this restaurant could greatly benefit from a menu and kitchen staff overhaul! It sucked because we paid for a pricey four course meal on NYE and left disappointed and unsatisfied. We would've been happy to pay the money for quality food, but that was just not the case. Pros: Coconut Frappe signature drink, Garlic Prawns appetizer, and service. Otherwise, do not waste your money."}
{"text":"Outstanding dining experience.    Seated promptly on this Friday evening.  Waiter showed perfect timing bringing water and drinks.  Started with the Calamari which was phenomenal.    Continued with the Misoyaki Butterfish and the Shellfish Sampler which were both outstanding.  The Butterfish simply melted in my mouth.  Tempted to get a second order.  Delicious!   Polished off the dining experience with the Hot Chocolate Souffle.  Fantastic.    The timing, ambiance, adroit service and especially the food...wow...what a great dining experience.  Kudos to the chef, staff and management of this restaurant.  Well done."}
{"text":"5 stars! Excellent service from the staff. Good selection of food and drinks. I have to say the place has a very nice ambiance and they have the best chocolate soufflé in town! I've been here 4x for the past 2 weeks taking friends from the east coast. I was pleasantly surprised the first time I've been here because it said attire is casual but with the service and the presentation of food everything exceeded my expectations! Most of the people that I brought here are my colleagues from NY who are doctors/therapists and they are really hard to please when it comes to finding a good place to dine out since everybody came from a different culture. So far everybody loved it!   The staff is very attentive and they will make you feel special. My friends Pia and Tim were very happy with what the staff prepared for them and they can't stop telling their friends back in MI how Roy's made their stay in Vegas very special."}
{"text":"Although good, the food wasn't anything spectacular. The seared scallops were cooked well, but the flavors just fell flat for me. This was especially true for the carrot puree and squash which came with the meal.   The lobster dumpling for an appetizer was delicious. The pineapple upside down was a 3 out 5 as well, but the coconut ice cream had a great flavor."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Roy's since when I lived in Hawaii 25 years ago.  I also enjoyed the Chandler Roy's when I lived in the east valley.  I went there for my wife's Bday and our dinner was disappointing.  Our check in with reservation took too long.  We ordered the calamari appetizer and the sauce with it was way too sour.  I know Hawaiian Poke and this was not the real deal--it had tomatoes and tortilla chips.  The butterfish was good, but they had the same topping of tomatoes and onion on our braised rib dish--kind of strange.  The service was decent, but slow.  I will give this place one more try."}
{"text":"I have been going to Roy's Restaurants since I lived on Oahu 30 years ago and have always had a great time.  I took my wife for her birthday last week.  The check-in took over 15 minutes even with a reservation.  The service was very slow as well.  They did not serve complimentary edamame which I almost always receive.  We ordered the potstickers--overcooked and too crunchy on edges.  The waiter recommended the calamari--it came in a very sour sauce that was not good.  I wish they had served the calamari with a side for dipping.  Having lived in HI, I know Poke and I have never seen it served with green tomatoes and odd sauce--nothing close to authentic.  Butterfish and short rib dinners were both covered with the same tomato and onion topping--very strange.  My wife did not receive a birthday dessert.  I still have cash on gift card, otherwise I would not go back."}
{"text":"Although we have eaten at -- and really enjoyed -- the Roy's on Oahu, our dinner at the Roy's in Las Vegas was very disappointing. One fish entree was raw, the other was way overcooked and served lukewarm. Even the crabcake appetizer, one of our favorites at Roy's, was off at the Las Vegas location.  Service was average and hurried, likely because we didn't order any alcohol. I would never return to this location again -- it's way, way below the standard set by the rest of the franchise."}
{"text":"I'm not a chocolate person (I know there must be something wrong with me), but their chocolate souffle is h-e-a-v-e-n-l-y!!!  I go there now just for that and their martini's....oh and the outdoor resort atmosphere!!!  Pair that with great company (**wink wink**)...and you have the perfect evening!!"}
{"text":"Yeah! I'm here! Happy Hour daily. $5 special app and beer menu at bar, outside covered patio, and sushi counter only 4pm-6:00pm"}
{"text":"We hosted dad's 70th birthday party here a few years ago for around 20 guests. I am so glad that we chose Roy's as the venue as the service was exceptional from the planning stages to finish. Before the actual date, I exchanged emails with the group sales manager, who was very cooperative and accommodating when it came to choosing the right pre fixe menu, room, etc. He was even there in attendance at the actual event to make sure everything was running smoothly. The private banquet room was very polished looking with individual lighting, music controls and private doors - the room even had a 60\" presentation screen so that we could play PowerPoint slides celebrating dad's life achievements. The menus even had a personalized birthday logo/message for dad - these soft personal touches really carried far!!  Seeing as how our guests were 95% Korean and of the conservative older generation, I was slightly worried that they may not like the non-traditional Hawaiian cuisine; however, they all raved and loved the Asian inspired dishes and said they fit their palates perfectly. If you are thinking of hosting a private party in Las Vegas, I highly recommend Roy's!!"}
{"text":"Everything from the food to the service was fantastic. The staff was 100% courteous, friendly, and attentive the whole time. Glasses were never empty. Plates were cleared as soon as they were done. My dad forgot his reading glasses and couldn't read the menu, so our waiter brought out a pair so he could see. It's little details like that take a place from good to great. They even have a vegetarian menu, so my sister was especially pleased. My whole family enjoyed their meals. I got the lettuce wraps, which were great and the truffled mac and cheese as a side dish. The mac and cheese was heavenly, very rich and filling. Also the chocolate souffle for desert was incredible! Just the right amount of rich and gooey on the inside!  Will absolutely return."}
{"text":"On our last night on vacation, we ate at Roy's. It was very busy due to a large corporate event in the hotel but we had no problem getting a 7 PM reservation and were seated promptly. Service was polite, efficient, not rushed. We ordered the appetizer for two item (included lobster pot stickers, pork ribs, shrimp, tuna roll, and more) and then, an add'l order of pot stickers. All was excellent and presentation 4-star."}
{"text":"We went here for our \"splurge\" meal while staying in Vegas.   The ambience is nice, dark while not being \"too day to read\" dim with nice music playing and a real shortage of hokey Hawaiian kitsch which is nice.   My wife had a cocktail which had been steeped in a pineapple for five days, so that's pretty cool, and it was tasty. I got a beer from Kona which was also very good. For an appetizer we got the salt and pepper calamari. It was well cooked with a nice light breading and a delicious miso marinara dipping sauce. For dinner I had the scallops, which came on a bed of pork belly and potato purée. It was amazing and melted in my mouth like butter. My wife got the Butterfish and it was the best fish I've had. So, so so good and lives up to its \"butter\" name.  Overall excellent service and very delicious food. Would definitely recommend this place to others in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The Butter Fish is one hell of a dish. 5 mother stars!   We tried various appetizers and I do not plan on ordering any of them again. I was particularly disappointed with the lobster potstickers because they were so overrated! I'd say the appetizers are in the edible 3 stars category.  I ordered an old fashioned and it was terrible. I'm guessing their bartenders are not real bartenders but some random staff? The old fashioned is the most basic and one of the oldest drink so I'd think a restaurant like Roy's wouldn't get it wrong. Hence, I will rate them as a 1 star in this category.  The service was standard and around 4 stars because our waiter was on his game with all our dishes.   I'd definitely come here again for the Butter Fish. Nothing else, just him."}
{"text":"Drinks-4.5 stars Waiter (Frank)-5 stars Food-4 stars  The canoe appetizer was so yummy! But for 10 bite sized pieces of food, $26 is a bit much.   My husband had the prix fixe and it's an awesome deal. The bi bim bap appetizer was tasty but a lil on the small side. His hangar steak was done to perfection. The soufflé dessert was great if you like super chocolatey stuff.   I had the fish trio. The seared ahi was ok, but the salmon and butterfish were the better of the 3. If only the butterfish tasted more like miso like it was supposed to.   Overall, great and solid 4.5. I'm from and love the one in Hawaii so that's the only one that gets a 5 from me :P"}
{"text":"This is the review for their happy hour.  The Skinny: Came in for Monday night Martini night and was unimpressed with the quality of the food (2), service: the bar service is below expectations (1) value: for $30 to try their happy hour menu, not only is it expensive but not that impressive. Avoid.(1.5 star experience bump up to 2).  I was running late from work to meet up with the hubs for Roy's Happy Hour. For the record, this was his idea.  We'd previously been to the Summerlin location (before it closed) for happy hour so we were expecting a somewhat similar experience.   To describe the atmosphere, the happy hour crowd looked like a bunch of aspiring yuppies who can't quite afford the lifestyle. Not exactly my scene but whatever, I went with it. After all, I was here for the food.  Meh.   We tried the Misoyaki butterfish lettuce cups ($6 during Monday night happy hour), Shrimp and Pork Gyoza($6), the Red Curry Samosas($6) Crispy Pork and Steamed Bun ($6). Because I got there late, the hubs finished off his Wagyu burger without me ($9).  I will have to rely of my husband's input on the Wagyu burger. Here's his take on it: the bun:meat ratio was decent however the lack of truffle/togarashi flavor, overcooked patty (medium-well... the cow is crying) and piss poor presentation (the crust of the bun looks like it was molting) makes it a pass.  The Misoyaki butterfish lettuce cups (3pcs)were very lackluster. Although the misoyaki butterfish tasted fine, the dish felt underseasoned with the boiled/watery verimicelli noodles underneath. The flavor of the fried shallots were overwhelmed with some dismal thick batter it was drenched in.   After tasting a really exceptional steamed bun the other day from a new ramen establishment, I was really looking forward to sampling Roy's Crispy pork belly with steamed bun. Sporting 2 small steamed buns, I would have been willing to pay the $6 if I thought they were drop dead good. Unfortunately they did not pass the muster. The crispy pork belly was a bit too dry and it just didn't melt in your mouth like it ought to. There was definitely too little meat in the bun. The bun itself was a little generic tasting and didn't have the lightness of a great mantou. The flavors were okay but nothing special. This was the least offensive dish.  Shrimp and Pork Gyoza. If you serve boiled dumplings, the filling better taste damn good just by the nature of how you plan to cook them. Unfortunately, this dish can't recover from the lack of shrimp and under seasoned pork. In addition, the dish was texturally uninteresting. Served with standard yet diluted (likely due to the water from the boiled dumplings) sweet Thai chili sauce - aka known as \"Firecracker\" sauce, they were definitely underwhelming and not worth 4 gyoza for $6. Not to mention, these were the fugliest dumplings I have ever seen. No Asian worth their salt would ever let these dumplings out of their kitchen out of sheer embarassment.  The Red Curry Samosas fell flat... literally. The puff pastry did not hold up to the rather flavorless bland curry filling. The pastry just sank into a greasy, soggy mess and didn't have the distinct butter layers one would expect with a half decent puff pastry dough. Even freaking Pepperidge Farm puff pastry tasted better than the crap we were served. Of note, the filling contained very little chicken and was very starchy due to all the potatoes. Again 3 pc for $6 is a rather small serving size. That being said, it perhaps was a blessing there wasn't too much of a bad thing.  Considering the level of cuisine you'd expect given the price, this joint doesn't pass the muster. The hubs and I paid $33 for badly presented, poorly textured, flavorless, greasy food and I can in no way recommend this place.  Adding insult to injury, service at the bar was pretty dismal. As soon as I arrived, the server came up and asked what I wanted to drink. I said water. I never got my water and resorted to stealing my hubs glass. And I was there for at least 20 minutes. I'm not even sure why she bothered to ask. I tried to wave her over to grab the check. We made eye contact but she was too busy yammering with her coworker to care. Finally, when she did deign herself to bring the check, she messed up the charges on one of the dishes. This was despite my husband confirming with her before he ordered if the misoyaki butterfish was discounted to $6 on Mondays.  Given the current plethora of great restaurants in Vegas, you could do much better elsewhere at a much more reasonable price. Combined with the poor service, I am uncertain how this location is able to survive in  this competitive environment. I was really tempted to give this place a 1 star review however the food was still edible albeit not much more than that. Therefore this joint gets a 1.5 starred review with a very reluctant bump up to 2 star."}
{"text":"We came for Father's Day brunch. They had a special two course menu for the occasion, your meal included an appetizer and an entree. Kids meals came with a fruit cup to start and dessert after. The wedge salads were phenomenal. I had the lobster bisque which had an amazing flavor but it upset my stomach and I was unable to enjoy the rest of my meal. I ordered the lobster omelet as my entree and was very underwhelmed. Not worth the high price tag. There was very little flavor and very little seafood in the omelet and a lot of onion, which I am not a huge fan of. Those in our party that ordered the steaks and short ribs were very pleased with their meals. The service was good, they changed out our silverware between each course, which we ended up laughing about by the end of the meal. I've never used so many different forks and spoons and knives in one sitting. The lighting was incredibly dim for a mid-day meal. I would understand if it was dinner time and they were trying for an intimate atmosphere, but it was 12 in the afternoon. I want to be able to read the menu, see the food I'm eating, see my family...well maybe not them so much but definitely the food!  If you want dessert you have to let them know early in the meal, as they need 20 minutes to prepare."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Girls night, had Ahi Tuna Poke, Lakanilau Roll, Canoe for two appetizer and wine. Tyler was our bartender and couldn't have asked for better service... Thank you Tyler! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Would recommend this restaurant to everyone.  Great food and service.  Best dessert ever!"}
{"text":"First time here. Good food interesting flavor Japanese influence. Reasonable prices nice atmospheres definitely will have to come back!"}
{"text":"I wish I remembered my bartenders name he had an accent and was very helpful into trying to figuring out something they no longer had on the menu but they were still willing to cook it up for me this place is very good"}
{"text":"Once again I am completely \"under-whelmed\". For the price point you'd believe it would be fantastic. Not so much. Ordered the butter fish which is a Roy's classic and received a \"new\" version on the presentation. The fish was flat and a tad overcooked and the rice was in a shaped triangle. Where was the version atop the forbidden rice? Took two colleagues there for a dinner after a meeting and the bill was right around $300. I am quite sure for $100/person there are better choices in the valley. It seems on more than one occasion at the 2 Roy's in the valley the service has been off. Not, bad per se. Just not what you would expect for a place of this \"expected\" caliber. A good example would be; the waiter in a clueless fashion interrupting speakers in a business meeting to ask \"how the bread tastes?\" Why? because your server just started at Roy's last week. Perhaps they have issues with employee turnover as well.  Over priced, unprofessional, simply just not that good."}
{"text":"On 4/24/17, I hosted a dinner party of 10, for one of my company's very best customers at Roy's in Las Vegas.  I had hosted a dinner for them at another Las Vegas restaurant previously that did not go well at all and this night was the redemption for that.  I have dined at Roy's many times, in various locations and had complete confidence tonight would be a memorable experience for my guests.    The evening started out well at the restaurant's bar and continued into the restaurant.  The first course went off just as expected and excellent as usual.  Our waitress then notified me that the kitchen was backed up and there would be a minor delay with the second course.  I dine out multiple times a week, entertaining guests often and understood that these things do sometimes happen; no problem.  Twenty five minutes later, I asked for an update and am now embarrassed and becoming annoyed.  Our waitress apologized and when she returned, informed me it would be another ten minute wait.  Fifteen minutes later, I asked her what was going on.  She could not provide me with anything more than an apology and free drinks for the table.  I declined the drinks and asked for the manager.  The manager apologized, offered free drinks again and told me I would be the next ticket up; again with no real explanation.  One hour has now passed in between courses and we finally received our second course.  To my surprise, the food was barely warm.  I was dumbfounded.  We feared turning down the food as we just wanted the terrible night to end.  We accepted another bottle of wine, this one on the house.  The waitress was obviously not thinking and fell into her routine by asking if we wanted desert, reminding us there would be a wait for the chocolate dessert.  Predictably, we declined any last course or beverages.  I profusely apologized again to my guests but the apology was sounding ridiculous having been repeated so many times over the last hour and a half.    I have no idea what occurred to allow our table to not be served while others were; including a much larger party in the private dining room.  All I can tell you is that I have only experienced one other dinner with very similar circumstances in my thirty years in sales."}
{"text":"I don't usually visit Roy's in Hawaii because their locations tend to be in shopping centers - not on the ocean. But here in Phoenix, I have found it to be a challenge to get really good, fresh fish and Roy's is my \"go-to\" spot when I am craving something coastal or Hawaiian. Our most recent visit was for an anniversary dinner, but despite reservations.....we were not seated for 1/2 hour. My husband was told the earliest reservation he could make was for 5:30, but when we arrived we not only waited, but noticed the patio and restaurant was quite busy with customers seated well ahead of us. The fact that this was a rough start was soothed by Roy's always-fantastic food. We split the lobster ravioli as an appetizer, and the restaurant really should put this on the menu as an entree. It was \"ONO\" (Hawaiian for delicious). Speaking of Ono, how could I pass that up as my entree?? I didn't even read the rest of the menu! I went straight for the Ono, and I have no idea what the buerre blanc was, but it was roll-my-eyes-omg wonderful!. I have family members moving here soon, and this will be our special spot for many occasions in the future."}
{"text":"\"Making it okay to have seafood in phoenix\"  Yes, yes, that sounds like an awful thing to say! But it really is true, I have had some fabulous seafood dishes in phoenix and some that left a bit to be desired. A group of us came here for the pre-fixe menu. You get an entree and a regular size app for a fixed priced. It's actually a really good deal considering this place is err a little on the pricey side.  We sit down and everyone is super nice! As we wait for our orders, we are brought out some spicy thai like edamame. It was delish!  Before talking about my meal, let's talk about how absolutely knoweldgeable our waitress was. I hate I can't remember her name, but she was SUPERB.. I always say it is nice when you talk with someone who knows the menu down to how the best way to serve it is (i.e. fish should be medium because it loses flavor the longer it's cooked) but offered flexibility when I wanted my potstickers well done (texture always gets me).  My group has the crunch golden pot stickers and calamari - fantastic! They are really setting the tone for me.  For my entree I had the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi - this was mahvelous and cooked to absolute perfection. The spicy mustard that accompanied with it took it over the edge! Everything else my group ordered was good as well. People had no complaints which is hard to do in big groups.  Last but not least, dessert. There was some chocolate goodness and something else. I'm not a big fan of desserts, but for those who are.. these were quite tasty!  Would totally go back and Mondays made it way more reasonable."}
{"text":"Roy's usually is a good time with friends or family combined with great Hawaiian fusion. However, tonight was the opposite. The host started the night off with a snobby attitude and a real lack of concern for customers.   Server Josh was nice and attentive.   Food was from atrocious all the way to terrific. Ahi poke appetizer was not good. You can get a better poke from the $8 quick serve places that are super popular nowadays. Tuna was cut too small so it was mushy and horribly bitter cucumbers were also included.   As always, Roy's takes care of kids with a quick appetizer and a large portion for the braised short ribs.   One Ahi tuna entree came out properly seared while another came out completely over cooked. When sent back, the exact opposite came out where one side of the tuna was not even touched by the grill. The spices tasted uncooked and raw and they even served it with a raw carrot. Makes you feel like the chef was messing with us since we said yes first one was over cooked.   Chocolate soufflés were of quality and taste as usual.   Manager took care of the issues."}
{"text":"This place is great! The service is excellent and the food is delicious. I stopped in for the happy hour I've heard such good things about... And everyone was right. I had the sliders which come with fries, the mini beef tacos, and creme brulee. And I ate it all. (Don't judge me.)  I sat at the bar and I wish I had gotten my server's name because he should be recognized for providing such great service. You can tell everyone really enjoys their jobs here. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at Roy's before, and I was NOT disappointed!!!  For dinner, I had the blue cheese encrusted Salmon with white and green asparagus (as did one of my dinner companions), and the other had the Mahi-Mahi.  We were all very pleased.  My friend and I who ordered the salmon found ourselves wanting to lick the sauce off the plate.  The salmon was perfectly cooked with a slight crispy edge.  For desert, my friend had a chocolate martini and I a hazelnut martini.  Both were yummmm-oooo!  Plus, between the 3 of use we ordered the pineapple upside down cake, served with coconut ice cream, the chocolate souffle served with vanilla ice cream (the gooey center of this souffle was finger licking good), the creme brule, and the fruit tart with blueberry lavender ice cream (this was AMAZING ice cream).  You practically had to roll us out of there because these were all the next best thing to great sex.  Service was excellent and all was well worth the price.  GOOOOOO!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, great birthday experience with my friends.  Loved the food, and their attention to detail."}
{"text":"I gotta say, the service we got at Roy's was the best service I've ever gotten and ever since that visit I measure all other waiters by that standard. It was absolutely outstanding! We celebrated a special occasion there and we couldn't have been happier with our choice of a restaurant. It might be just a little bit too loud if you want a quiet romantic dinner but the service and the food make up for it. Everything was delicious, and again, the service was quite impressive! The waiter made us feel like we were his most special customers not just that night, but ever!:) So Roy's will always be our first choice for special occasions."}
{"text":"Wow!  It really was very, very good.  The server was a little weird but overall everything was peachy!"}
{"text":"Normally I trade in my credit card points for more useful things like gas cards or statement credits, but a few months ago I traded in some and got 100 bucks in cards good at either Roy's or Flemings.  Then this past Wednesday it turned out that both Mr. M and I were dressed nicely at the same time (usually I'm working from home in my \"Hoptimistic a cold beer is in my future\" t-shirt and some old shorts), and we decided to go to Roy's.  I have eaten at several different Roy's, but it's been a few years, and my Mr. had never been to one.    We started with the surf and turf app from the Chef's Selection menu and this was absolutely delicious.  Two grilled shrimp, cooked perfectly and slightly smoky.  Then there was a 3-4 oz. bacon-wrapped filet on top of a light potato puree.  Oh my.  If we go back anytime soon, I want one of those all to myself.  That disappeared very quickly.    We also ordered some cocktails and I had the Buffalo Trace Manhattan and he had the Rye Me a River.  Both very nice and well worth their 12 dollar price tag, but remind me to hit their happy hour sometime so I can afford to eat and drink here more often.  Then for our entrees my husband ordered the Himalayan sea salt ribeye off of the Chef's Selection menu and I ordered the Roy's Trio, which our server offered to make into a quad with the addition of the Ahi for $3.95.  Heck yeah!     We had decided not to take our phones in, and just talk and have a nice meal so I don't have any pictures of the main meal, but suffice it to say, it was all perfect.  The way they prepare the fish here is just amazing to me.  The ahi and the butterfish are so light they melt in your mouth, and the macadamia crusted mahi and salmon are so flavorful.  We also really enjoyed sharing the ribeye which was cooked to a perfect medium rare.    Our server, Anthony, was the most gracious host and when I mentioned we were sharing our food he brought a couple of clean plates right away so we could pass bites across the table, and was very prompt with drink refills.    We don't usually order dessert, and were too full to have the chocolate soufflé or the pineapple upside down cake while we were there, but I thought it would be nice to take something home for later.  On the specials menu they had carrot cake listed and that always sounds appealing so I ordered a piece to go.  When I asked Anthony if they put whipped cream or anything on it, he said \"yeah, they put all kinds of cream and mango or pineapple something on it.....\"  I asked him if we could just get it plain and he said, \"Sure.\"  He got it all boxed up to go and put it in a bag to carry out.    When the bill came it was $140.21 before tip, as expected, so I was really glad I had the gift cards.  The only disappointment came when we got home, and I totally take the blame for this.    When I got home I decided to take a look at the carrot cake and was totally shocked I paid 9 bucks for 2- inch and a half square pieces of plain carrot cake.  See picture.  Nothing else.  No cream cheese frosting.  No nothing.  Ah I should have known.  A great deal of enjoying a meal at Roy's is the presentation.  I'm sure they take these 2 little squares and really doll them up.  9 bucks.  4 bites of cake.  Well, live and learn.  Next time I'll ask more questions or look in the box before I take it out of the restaurant.  Overall, I would definitely go back to Roy's sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"It's good if you are looking for something a little bit different. Just be careful with the menu because their plates are a big extravagant for my taste (that's the only reason for one star less) so you need to know what you are ordering or you risk not liking it. I went there late on a Sunday and the hostess let me know they couldn't help me at that time but she walked me out and showed me some options. Thank you for that. As promised I came back two days later and new hostess was ok, but once inside at my table their service was INCREDIBLE. They make you feel like royalty. I had different servers picking up my plates and asking how things were going, it seemed like they were working as a team.   I got the butter fish plate with the black rice. A bit to strong taste for me, didn't love it. But salad/dessert absolutely delicious. I'm sure if I got the steak or sushi I would've liked the meal a lot more. Again, know what you are ordering."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Roy's and I have to say I was pretty impressed. Our server was awesome (I believe her name was Kelani) she did a great job of answering all of our questions. I started off with the Hawaiian martini and my fiance had the cucumber cilantro margarita both were very good and unique although kind of pricey. We then had the Asian soft tacos which weren't personally my favorite however John loved them. I ordered the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi and originally when it came out it was super salty I could barely taste anything else at all. I let our waitress know and she was very quick to fix the issue and brought me out a whole new plate and it was amazing, nice, flaky, and moist it had great flavor. I had also ordered a side of the pesto risotto and that was tasty as well. John ordered the white truffle and black pepper sea scallops which were cooked to a perfect medium as he had asked also served with the risotto. Both meals were so good we had to force ourselves to stop eating just to save room for the pineapple upside down cake which was to DIE for. It was made fresh to order and served with homemade coconut ice cream(which I could of ate a whole bowl of alone lol) Overall I had a great experience here and while there was a little mishap with the mahi mahi at first they were quick to fix it and the manager even came by and apologized and took care of our dessert for us."}
{"text":"Although I've been to the Roy's in Chandler several times, this was my first experience at the Marriott location. To be clear this location is inside the Marriott hotel on the lower level.   My husband took me here for my birthday on 1/14 and everything about our experience was perfectly lovely:  -Hostess was friendly and we were asked to be seated right our reservation time -The server was knowledgeable, patient and affable -We ordered Korean soup as an appetizer=hearty and surprisingly filling -The meatloaf is AMAZING and I would order it over and over again   And of course Roy's boils all down to the chocolate souffle which is deliciously decadent. Hands down, this is my favorite dessert to order at ANY restaurant.   I truly believe Roy's is a perfect place to celebrate a special occasion since they gave me a birthday card, took a picture of us and gave us a copy, and even threw in a yummy brownie with a candle. :D  I love Roy's in general but this location seems more intimate with the booths. I would request to sit here on a date. ;)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but food not up to par.  My wife had the Mahi Mahi.  Overdone, dry.   My filet was .... Well, ehhh, okay, I guess.   The wasabi mashed potatoes were .... Well, okay, I guess, not much texture or taste.   Two stars is being generous."}
{"text":"First, I usually love Roys restaurant.  I've been to the Roys restaurants in many cities within the United States. This was first visit to the Roys in Las Vegas.   My expectations were exceeded. First we had the edamame. Now, sometimes these are great and sometimes (depending on location) the are so-so. Tonight in Las Vegas they were great. Next we had appetizers (the $36 prixe fixe). Appetizers were spring rolls. We got three of them with two different sauces: peanut and citrus.  Terrific.  Then, a sirloin steak done to perfection with a great wine sauce.  It was perfect. And finally, Roys upside down pineapple cake (I always have this when I go to Roys). The manager stopped by to ask how everything was........ I told him everything was perfect and it was indeed a perfect dining experience tonight."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends 25th birthday party.  She rented out the private room for it... was a splendid time...  The only beef I really had was the autograt for our bill...  No problem if the entire group of 20 was on it... But these were individual drink bills and still the autograt.... weird...   Service and food was 4 stars....  drink bill was 1 star  :p"}
{"text":"Dinner with a colleague during our conference was great at Roy's. Lovely list of signature cocktails and a very seafood-centered menu made me very happy. The service is impeccable, not only are they patient and knowledgeable, but very quick. Like be quick to eat or indicate you are still eating or they WILL clear your table. Ambiance is nice, a little dark for my taste, but a solid dining experience."}
{"text":"Very delicious place. The Prix Fixe Menu is a good deal! I tried their pork chop dish and between that and the appetizer, this was way too much food for me (perfect for the boys though). We were here for a birthday dinner and they give a free small cake to the birthday person as well. It was a nice touch. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Maybe it is because the Roy's in San Diego and Hawaii are in locations that are more fun for me (like the ocean view), or maybe it is because once I got stuck with the bill for three of us for happy hour where I only had one glass of wine and the total was $160.00 but, this isn't my favorite place. It is clean and has trendy decor, but the prices of the food and drinks don't add up to my satisfaction for the value. If your girl friends want to go there for happy hour pick some where else and don't let them get take away food for their hubbies on your tab!"}
{"text":"Inaugural visit on a groupon. Came at happy hour and sampled fine specialty cocktails, and numerous entrees all at 7 bux. Everything was tasty, service was stellar, and the atmosphere was 4 star and very comfortable. Short ribs, lobster potstickers, wagyu sliders, ebi rolls, udon, crab fried rice,  mai tais and martinis on the happy hour bill. Great way to sample many fares and walk out with some green still in your wallet. Definitely recommended and will be returning!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I are here for a convention and came here for Dinner last night.   Our waiters Scott and Adele were quick, attentive and really nice.   We have the pork belly dim sum as an appetizer, which was phenomenal! For my entree I had the hanger steak. For the price, I expected a bit more to it. When it says it includes carrots and peas, they meant one carrot and one pea :p But the steak was cooked perfectly ad tasted amazing. The rest of the group really enjoyed their dishes as well.    Margarita tasted good, but was a little weak, I stuck to beer after having one. Per my coworkers they had a great Pinot.   Had a really nice time :)"}
{"text":"What better way to start your dinner than with a fresh and intoxicating drink? Fresh pineapple juice and rum make for the perfect Original Hawaiian Martini. If that sounds too sweet for you the Fred & Ginger is a much stronger drink ($10.95-11.95).  Roy's offers a Winter Prix Fixe for anyone who loves to treat themselves to something special. The three-course Prix Fixe ($35.95) is a chance to savor anything from Olive Oiled Seared Mahi Mahi to a 5 Spice Braised Duck Leg. A Prix Fixe can satisfy every single taste bud. The hearty Split Pea & Rock Shrimp Soup and fresh Poached Pear and Pecan Salad are excellent appetizers to an evening of Hawaiian Fusion. Keep in mind you might have to wait a bit between dishes but Roy's is definitely worth it.  Two of the entrees featured in the Prixe Fixe are the Seafood Cioppino and Grilled Wagyu Meatloaf.  Although the brothy cioppino came with mussels, scallops and shrimp its flavor paled in comparison to the meatloaf. The meatloaf's braised mushroom sauce and perfectly grilled meat made each bite sinfully good. This tasty entree also comes with creamy mashed potatoes and veggies.  The Winter Prix Fixe insists on ending your night with two dessert options. The seasonal Ginger Baked Apple with oats and cinnamon wasn't as decadent as it appeared. Be careful, what looks like ice cream is actually brown sugar mascarpone vanilla bean sauce! The apple almost tasted like a fancy granola bar...Always on the menu is Roy's Famous Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle with vanilla bean ice cream and raspberry sauce. This souffle is filled with a brilliant dark chocolate sauce that escapes the warm cake after your first bite! Don't forget to leave room for this amazing dessert!  One nice touch that Roy's offers is if you are celebrating a birthday or anniversary they actually take the time to individualize menu inserts wishing you a happy anniversary/birthday that you can take home afterward. Beyond that, waiters will even snap your picture and place it for you in a cute Roy's themed frame! If that's not enough your waiter even brings you a small dessert plate personalized with a special message.   If you are looking to enjoy a romantic dinner check out Roy's Hawaiian Fusion restaurant on 56th street and Ray. One tip: Roy's doesn't open until 5 and it does get pretty busy so consider making a reservation-(480) 705-7697.  No time for a three-course meal? Check out their fabulous happy hour 4:30-6:30 daily!"}
{"text":"Other than missing the tropical breezes of the Islands, this particular Roy's has some of the best ambiance of all.  First off, the service is awesome! Matthew is extraordinary at the bar! He is very friendly, super-attentive, knowledgeable and generous. I recommend dining at the bar if you have the option.  Next, the decor is very pleasing. Though the locations I've been to on the Islands (Kauai and Ko'Olina) are wonderful just because it is Hawaii afterall, the design of this location is more aesthetically pleasing and intimate. I've dined here a total of three times now - twice in the bar and once in the restaurant and I find it very enjoyable.  Finally, the food is consistent with all other Roy's locations, which is very good. Tonight I enjoyed the potstickers and had just an \"okay\" experience with the seasonal salad only because I didn't inquire about the dressing (didn't pair well with my wine). Matthew was kind enough to bring me something to clear my palate afterwards so I could enjoy the remainder of my wine. From my recollection of the other two visits, I remember the food to be quite enjoyable (I believe I had the butterfish at least once and maybe even twice).  When in Chandler, Roy's definitely ranks highly in my book. I almost went somewhere else to expand my experience when in the area, though am glad I didn't.   I've dined at several other Roy's just for context: Kauai, Ko'Olina, San Francisco, and Carmel and this is one of the nicest. Who knows, I may be visiting the Ko'Olina location again in just over a week..."}
{"text":"The three stars given here are an average of my two visits to Roy's while I was in Vegas last week. Having lived on Maui, I am very familiar with Roy's and was looking forward to having some island fish. My first visit on Tuesday,my buddy and I had a great experience. Jeff, our server, made some great recommendations on wine based on our entrees. I had hoped to have some Opah or Opakapaka but neither were on the menu,so I turned 180 and went for the lemongrass steak. It was cooked to order and was delicious. I finished with an Apple Strudel which was ok...a bit dry, but overall a tremendous night with it almost reaching a five star with Jeff's great service.  Saturday night, however, was the complete opposite and the antithesis to the Roy's experience I love. My party of three made reservations early in the week for dinner at 7pm. We showed up a few minutes early and was told it would just be a few minutes for our table and could we wait in the bar area? Being the drunk I am, I embrace this idea like peace on earth...but after getting great drinks from Jeff (see earlier in the review) We notice party after party that came in after us getting seated...45 minutes afer our reservation we bring this up to the maitre d' who says, \"this way\" and brings us to an open table. No Sorry, no there was a mixup...he just turns heel and goes. We then wait another 10 minutes for the waiter where we order our apps and dinner because it's now an hour past our original reservation. The Mongolian Beef Satay arrives at the table 30 minutes later...the plate red hot and the beef barely warm...sitting under a heat lamp will do that. Our entrees helped get us back in better moods with my Seared Ono cooked perfectly. The manager came by the table and when told about the time and service challenges made a generous comp to the table. It certainly brought me back into the Roy's customer fold...but you might want to skip Sat night in the future and hit Roy's during the week...the Tuesday visit for me was a 5 and the Sat visit a 1. Take that for what it is worth."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for date night on a Friday. We didn't have a reservation but they sat us right away. Judging by the prices I expected the service to be impeccable. They were very polite but it took forever to get our drinks, forever to get our food, forever to get our bill and forever to pay. I felt like I was starving the entire visit and desperately trying to leave. The wine, the drinks, the food was above average. But for the price, I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Went here for my wife's birthday. Having been to the Roy's in Waikiki, I wanted to see if this Roy's was anything different. The ambience is quite cozy with the low lighting. We started with the Canoe Appetizer for Two which had the following: Thai Peanut Chicken Satay, Vegetable Spring Rolls, Szechuan Ribs, Spicy Tuna Roll, Kim Chee & Lobster Potstickers. Everything was DELICIOUS! Come with an empty stomach and this will be demolished i tell you. I like how each item came with a different sauce so you get a good variety of flavors and taste. My wife had the Roasted macadamia Nut crusted mahi mahi and I had the Asian fried chicken with sweet potato mash and asparagus for our entrees. I had the prie fixed menu which also included the tuna sashimi as my appetizer. The food was great of which we had still had a lot left over for breakfast tomorrow. We had the molten chocolate cake for our dessert. My wife is a chocoholic and she loved it. There were 2 things I remember that made this experience memorable for us. 1) Roy's made a special menu with my wife's name and 2) they gave a complimentary dessert with a candle. So overall, our night went great and eating at Roy's brought me back to dining at home in Hawaii."}
{"text":"My four stars mainly goes towards the Roy's Classic Trio for 30 bucks. There's salmon, ahi, and BUTTERFISH. THE BUTTERFISH, I LOVE. I like sea bass, and the butterfish was pretty darn close to tasting like sea bass. The soup, salad, and dessert were mediocre. Butterfish was delish =D  We came here for my uncle's birthday. You get free dessert, a polaroid photo of your party, and personalized menu (they print out a happy birthday greeting onto a blank paper  with your name and slide it into the inside sleeve of the menu)."}
{"text":"Gone here for years while staying at the hotel and it's really good. The seafood is always excellent and my kids love the food as well... Even if you don't like seafood there are other options for you to have. If you get a reservation and you give them the first names of your child(ren) then at the end of the meal they will bring out an ice cream sundae with your name on it. I really like that (good photo op) and so did my kids. Go for the chocolate soufflé that takes the chef 20 minutes to make... They usually ask you while you're eating your entrée and it is definitely worth it. Even if you're not saying at the hotel, you're visiting, or you live in Phoenix I highly encourage you to go to Roy's, but don't forget to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Roy's is always a great stop.  We were going out for my m-in-law's birthday, and she wanted some place with chocolate desserts.  Tried another local fave with Chocolate in the name but, holiday season and no reservation (my error)  - couldn't get seated there for 2+ hours.  Quick, where to go that's got chocolate, a reasonable wait, and gluten-free?  Roy's!  This is downstairs at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge - a bit tricky to find at night (the resort, not Roy's).  Dropped the cars at the valet and walked in - nicely decorated for Christmas - well done Marriott.  Downstairs and into Roy's - stylish.  I'd let them know we were on the ways, so they seated us almost immediately.    The servers were very attentive.  My wife and I split the wedge salad - that was a nice starter.  Then, I ordered the Ribeye (if you read my steak-joint reviews, you may sense a trend here). This was served with a peppercorn shoyu brandy sauce (kind of gravy-isa) and a side of truffled bacon mac & cheese.  It was very good (though I'd be just as happy without the gravy).  The mac and cheese was very good, too.  I got a chance to taste the scallops, too - they were good.  For dessert, since it was for a birthday, we ordered Chocolate souffles (gluten-free!) - one for everyone (gotta splurge now and then, and this was one of those 'now' occasions).  Roy's chocolate soufflé is splurge-worthy.   Only knock was that there was a private party in a room a few tables away from us (by the bathrooms) and whenever they left the partition door open, it let a cold draft come toward our table (along with 50+ people worth of 2-drinks-in chatter).  Not a big deal, but would've been better without that distraction.  It was a very good birthday dinner - happy m-in-law makes the holidays just that much better!"}
{"text":"The place: this restaurant is located inside the JW Marriott Resort & Spa. As soon as you walk in the resort you have to go downstairs (or take the elevator to the first floor). It has outdoor and indoor seating. As with any other restaurant there the hostess will ask you if you have a reservation. I didn't so I was offered to be seated outside. The outside area is next to another resturant so you can see people from Roy's and Twenty6 but they split both areas with some small trees. If you don't mind the heat and the ocational bugs (bees + flies) then seat outside. Is nice and they may have some entertainment (a singer) seating outside playing the guitar. Inside is a little bit more \"romantic\" so if this is a special night then I suggest you make a reservation and seat inside.   The food: just as an FYI the food is a bit expensive. All the entrees are over $30 (even the chicken dishes) and because this is hawaiian cuisine most dishes have really interesting/fancy names. Once you start reading the menu you will realized that some dishes have combination of ingredients that may sound weird to put together but I am sure are probably good. Since I was not too hungry I decided to order an appetizer (Calamari) and some sushi rolls (Ebi Roll and the Lobster California roll). All dishes came at the same time and the best one was the Ebi roll. It had shrimp tempura, avocado, coconut, habanero aioli and mango. To me, the calamari was not good (it was o-k but not great). They were in the shape of french fries and were though to eat (husband liked them though). As for the lobster california roll i was not a big fan but husband ate it (he thought it was ok).    The service: the service was ok. Our waitress was nice and took our orders right away but forgot about us until we were done eating and asked for the check.   Overall, the place is nice but the food is expensive for what it is. I don't think I can go back here again (even if I stay at the JW Marriott again)."}
{"text":"As I promised, I am updating my review of Roy's.  I went there last night and there was a great improvement over my previous visit.  We were seated promptly as the restaurant was about half full.  A waitress came over fairly quickly to take our drink orders.  We both had their \"Celebrate Fall\" special, consisting of an appetizer of breaded prawns on a bed of cabbage leaves and a great salsa.  Really delicious.  The crusted salmon was done according to order, i.e., well done for me and medium for my wife.  It was served on a bed of baby vegetables and was quite yummy, no complaints there.  I also ordered a wedge salad as my wife and I were both extremely hungry, pretty much having not eaten lunch.  The bread pudding for dessert was nothing short of outstanding, served with a garnish of fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream.  So, all in all, the food was really good.  So if the food was this good, why the three stars.  Well, for me to give 5 stars I would have to visit a restaurant several times and have a predominantly 5 star experience each time, so I'm no quite there with Roy's yet.  As I pointed out in previous reviews the food and service seems to be spotty, so I'll have to keep an open mind and return a few times to see if their game has truly been upped or if last night was a fluke.  Sorry to be so pessimistic, but my experience has made me very wary, considering that Roy's is not bottom of the barrel pricewise.  Four stars might have been appropriate, but there were a couple of missteps.    To start with, for some reason Roy's is a bit slow on the drinks front, which is odd as most restaurants make a large portion of their profit from the sale of alcohol.  That should prompt the bartenders and waiting staff to get those first drinks out ASAP.  Also, because we were so hungry I asked if we could order some bread.  The waitress told me they don't offer bread, but we could have some complimentary edamame if we wished.  I gladly accepted the offer, but the edamame never materialized.  I was also never asked if I wanted another beer - same comment about alcohol sales.  I don't get it.  (As an aside, Roy's has no beer on draught, just bottles, but I shall not hold that against them in the review.  Again, beer on tap may carry a higher margin than the bottled variety, so why not sell it that way?  I'll let you decide if this is a plus or a minus.  I do find it odd, though, since most good restaurants do offer tap beer and in larger quantities than a 12 oz. bottle provides.)  Lastly, I waited a full 15 minutes to get my bill.  I was basically ignored by the waitress and had to get another staffer to lasso her and get my bill ready.  Oh, yes, during our meal, a gentleman, who I assume to be the manager, did come to our, and everyone else's, table very briefly to inquire as to the quality of our experience.  I don't mean to be rude or mean, but his approach was more perfunctory than warm or cordial, but at least he made the rounds.  All in all I enjoyed the experience, but since 5 stars are out for the moment and since there were still a few hiccups with service, the best I can do at the moment is 3 stars.  I shall go back since the food was so good last night and the service has improved, but still not as good as it should be.   I would love to give this shop 5 stars, so I'll give them a chance to earn it."}
{"text":"Went for my wife's birthday. Food, service...everything was amazing. I boycotted Flemings a while back and so glad I did because I have tried some fantastic places, Roys is on the top of the list. The Ahi was the highest quality and super dark red. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary dinner mostly due to the fact that we had giftcards.  Service was excellent, food was good (although portions were small) and it was a little pricey.  Our party of 6 each had a cocktail, 3 of us got the prixe fixe and we all shared appetizers and the bill was over $500.  Cha ching!  However, they made our night really special, from placing a personalized \"Happy Anniversary\" mesage in each menu at our table to the dessert plate at the end of the meal, again personalized with a \"happy anniversary\" message.  Roy's you know how to do it right!  Just maybe increase your portion sizes a little and it would be perfect :)  Oh, and order the chocolate souffle for dessert.  To die for!"}
{"text":"Roy's is a perennial favorite on my hit parade.  When restaurant week occasioned itself upon us, I saw Roy's on the list and said let's go!  There are two things that make for a great restaurant:  1.)  product (the food), 2.) process (the experience).  From the moment we walked in the place, every single member of the Roy's team went out of their way to make us feel like royalty.  Secondly, the moment we sat down, a very deliberate system came into play that leaves you feeling very well cared for.  This is what the experience should be like!  The setting was beautiful, and the food was out of this world.  And....of course...the chocolate souffle.  If it were possible for one's mouth to experience an orgasm, Roy's chocolate souffle would be the ticket.  Great job Roy's!"}
{"text":"HUGELY disappointing!!!!  OK...we went here just because it was rated the #1 restaurant on trip adviser.  Wait to be seated...awesome...service...UNREAL.  Food...bleh.  We ordered 2 different entrees and an appetizer...honestly..we didn't finish them...we told the server we were not able to eat them...he apologized.  We actually got dessert...since we were still hungry...after not eating!  It was good..some sort of pineapple cake.  Overall...I won't go back."}
{"text":"I was still too full from lunch at The Coffee Cup in Boulder City to eat a whole dinner. I had the white sangria, excellent. Also the salad with the Asian pear and blue cheese crumbles. The dressing was mango, and delicious. But the best part were the desserts. We had the pineapple upside down cake w. coconut ice cream, and the chocolate molten cake, with raspberry coulis and vanilla ice cream. WOW! Both were just awesome. We don't have anything comparable to the pineapple upside down cake in Boston, it was fantastic. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my husband's 69th Birthday here on Monday night... Holy Cow ! Since our last visit this place has gone downhill : (  The food, the service is not what we've come to expect from Roy's !  It was so very disappointing ! If you want to sit on the patio for drinks and apps...Do Not Go Here ! The flies are unbelievable ! Go someplace else !"}
{"text":"Did the travel zoo deal- server was great, food was amazing! Actually liked it better than the one in Pebble Beach (my home town) will be back for sure"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for our Wedding Anniversary. We were half an hour early for our reservations, but they took it in stride. This may be the best service I've ever received from a restaurant staff. They were very into the \"special occasion\" and went WAY out of the way to make it special for us. They had their hands full, as the restaurant was busy, and I know there were at least 2 birthdays within earshot (no they don't sing to you). The food was FANTASTIC. We started with a spicy shrimp roll, it was VERY GOOD. My wife had the surf & turf (steak & lobster), she gave me a bite of both, and the steak may have been one of the tastiest steaks I've ever had. The lobster was also great, not overcooked, good flavor. I had ribs, done more like roast beef, it was also very good, a little \"fatty\", though that can be expected with ribs. I was also served something I'd never had before. It was like a hard boiled egg (yolk still runny - similar to over medium-like) then peeled, and fried like chicken... I had thought it was a hush-puppy or something similar, so I was surprised, but it was great! They gave us a free dessert, and a $20 gift card. We left with a great experience, bellies full & a framed picture of us that they took while we ate dessert. We will be recommending this place to our friends. Thank you for your wonderful service. I rated the food a 4/5 star, and that is probably harsh. The ribs were fatty, but still very good overall. I also rated the ambiance a 4/5 which I feel is fair. The tables are pretty close together, and the restaurant overall got pretty loud. It was a romantic ambiance, just loud. Everything else was worthy of 5 stars in my opinion."}
{"text":"After a few nights in Vegas with nothing but disappointments (thanks alot Bellagio!) Roy's was a much needed positive to our trip.  We made a reservation for 8:45 PM this past Sunday - but of course the Bellagio burned us  (not the first time!) Roy's posted closing time is 9:00 PM but we called and they offered to stay open for us until 9:15 PM!!! Outstanding! Who does that?! Anyways, we arrive at 9:15 PM exactly and they gave us a table.  The service was top notch. Very friendly, and the waiter was even happy to stay open for us! That is not common of most places after closing time!  I ordered the Thai Chicken. It was excellent! The meat slipped right off the bone.  Not sure what the sauce was it came with but DANG! It was great.  My better half ordered the salmon.  It came out looking like something out of a magazine! Spectacular!  All around this was one of the most positive facilities we visited during our 4 day stay in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not sure how this Roy's got such high marks on others reviews. We had eaten at the one on the island of Honolulu and it was outstanding. So we were thinking we were in for another great great. So in celebration of my birthday we looked forward to another great time. Unfortunately we were greatly disappointed. Don't bother with this establishment. The service was subpar. The food took a long time for service. My plate was not what was ordered.  The only thing I can share positive was the atmosphere.  Sorry we spent our money on this place. Never again."}
{"text":"It does not matter if I come here for restaurant week, a special occasion or simply happy hour, it reminds me so much of Hawaii.  We are always looking for a great deal, and they had one.  Restaurant week menu but not during restaurant week.  We had to take advantage as an excuse to go back and as usual we were not disappointed.  I love their food and their to die for chocolate lava cake.  I could just go for the cake any day of the week!!!   We ordered something different other than steak or seafood.  I tried the bone in pork chop and wow, it was simply dreamy.  I took half of it home because I had filled up with the rib appetizer.  I would say five it a try if you haven't been here and if you have, come back.  It saves us a trip from going back to Hawaii for this food (not that I would mind going back to Hawaii, but love this place as it is a treat)."}
{"text":"Well we were told about this place. I must say this was WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Over priced. We ordered surf & Turf and halibut. We had to send back the surf and turf. The steak had this super salty sauce we didn't ask for. Sent it back and the scraped it off and gave us the same steak. The halibut tasted like leather. Both were over 50-bucks. I would rather drive to Scottsdale and get a real steak or fish for a much cheaper price. Realistically you can go to out back and get the same steak.   Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"We had such a great date night here! I recommend a booth as its dark and quiet. Our waiter was great and gave recommendations that helped us. I had the mahi mahi and it was yummy. My hubby got the fish trio sampler and the butterfish was amazing. Drinks were great and the upside down pineapple dessert was great to finish the night. We will come back."}
{"text":"For work I was tasked with finding a place for dinner for our team last night.  It was a large group (19 people)... I picked Roy's because it was in the vicinity of my work and the yelp reviews were good.  Wow this place was really good... handled a large group with ease and the appetizers, food and drinks were all amazing.  I had their special which was four smaller servings of their butterfish, mahi mahi, salmon and seared ahi tuna.  I enjoyed this a lot, but the ahi tuna did not have a lot of flavor and others at the table who had the same thing agreed.  I also had a mango mojito that was perfect!  I did try a couple of bites of one of their signature deserts... it was a flourless chocolate cake with a creamy chocolate center and a hint of raspberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream it was soooo good!  If I am ever missing the wonderful fish that Hawaii has to offer I am heading straight back to Roy's it was really delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service!  Even better service than the Roy's in Maui, if that is even possible.  Our family loves Roy's.  It's one of our favorite restaurants and the location in Las Vegas was no exception.  Food was delicious, hot and fresh.  Service was outstanding.  Drink ninja was in full effect.  Thanks Roy's for another amazing dinner!"}
{"text":"my first-ever experience at one of roy yamaguchi's restaurants was on my tiny little island in the middle of the pacific ocean. poipu, kauai, hawaii to be exact. and since my fist experience, roy's restaurants never fail to amaze me.  this was a special occasion because it happened to be my birthday!! my husband and i decided to do something special and spend the weekend away from tucson and drive up to the phoenix area. i was excited to find a local favorite of mine from back home up here on the mainland.   i made my special birthday dinner reservation and was even excited that they answered the phone with a friendly 'aloha'.  as expected, we were seated at a nice, intimate table. the one thing i love about roy's is how personalized he makes your experience. because they knew i was coming in for my birthday dinner, they made a nice little insert for the menus brought to our table. when we were done ordering, they rolled the inserts up and gave them to us to have as keepsakes.   our server was gracious and kind the entire evening.  the husband had a combination of two types of seafood -- fish and scallops (that were hugeeeee!!) and i got the filet mignon. everything was cooked to perfection. of course we had to get the chocolate soufflé for desert. you can't ever go to roy's and not get chocolate soufflé. it should be against the law. it has to be the best desert on the face of the earth [in my humble opinion]. to top that off, they even brought out their signature flourless chocolate complete with candle and our server took our picture and framed it to also take home.  we both left fat & happy. if i could have it my way, i'd choose roy's restaurant for every special occasion we celebrate because the people that work for roy always go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect.   mahalo nui loa a hui hou, roy's chandler! hope to see you soon!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have never called the manager over at any establishment just to congratulate and compliment on the restaurant; Roy's changed that.  The girlfriend and I came for her birthday dinner, as a part of the celebration that I had planned for her. We picked this place since we always drove by it and never had the chance (or the wallet) to try the food. Upon entering, the Hawaiian vibe is undeniable, but starting from the hostess (who held the door open for us), to the bus person (who directed us to the bathroom, literally walked us there), to the waitress (might've been the best ever), the service was just amazing. Absolutely flawless.   The food...I mean where do I start. The lobster? The filet mignon? Or the trio fish plate that the girlfriend had? And that's not even mentioning the amazing chocolate souffle. I mean, it was completely on-point, and everything was as delicious as can be. The wine (Peru Sauvignon Blanc) was great, as well.  Nevertheless, the main reason why I gave this place 5 stars is because of the way they made my girlfriend feel. From the very beginning, everyone was warm and said \"Happy Birthday\" to her at least once. They gave her a free dessert with her name on it in chocolate syrup, and even gave us a free picture with a Roy's frame. I mean, I literally have never had an experience like this at any other establishment. My girlfriend had an absolutely amazing time, and it couldn't have been a better birthday dinner. In addition to the great food and great service, the way they made my girlfriend feel so special was, above all, the reason why I gave this place 5 stars.  Will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour! Having just moved to the area I have been searching for a location with quality food and tasty beer options with reasonable happy hour prices. Found it!! $5 apps, which I tried 4 of the 6 and haven't decided which I liked the best, as its a tough decision. Kona brewing co. Fire Rock pale for $3... yes please, and may I have another.   Check it out! And maybe I'll see you belly up... pull up a stool!"}
{"text":"We decided to go again for Happy Hour.  Good service and great price for the specialty beer (Kona Brewing Co. Fire Rock Pale Ale) which happens to be my favorite.  This beer is only priced at $3 during Happy Hour and a few select drinks at $7.  My GF decided to have Kahlua and Cream and that was $10 -- a little steep IMO.  Their Happy Hour menu is $7 per small dish; but with only 4 or 5 things on the menu you don't have much of a choice.  We had the Wagyu burger ($10), the ahi roll, and the crispy pork in steamed bun -- they were all good.  We ran up a bill of $60 and were going to leave and use our $20 gift card and were told that the gift card cannot be used for Happy Hour......WTF?  They never said that when we got the gift card as a kickback for spending more than $200 at Mother's Day!  So we had to buy an entree at $32 to use the gilft card.  So the net is that we spent $72 for Happy Hour.  Bottom line is Roy's is OK, but nothing special and their prices are high.  Make your own Happy Hour at some small bistro or some quaint Italian restaurant and it will probably be better and cheaper!"}
{"text":"My two stops in Vegas every year during the big Real Estate Convention are Nobu at the Hard Rock and Roy's here on Flamingo. Although I live just 15 minutes away from Roy's Anaheim, it seems I've been to this Vegas locale more often. And after learning that my old college roommate is the brother-in-law of chef partner Percy Oani, this is prolly a biased review! But again, I've been coming here every year, so this really should be a realistic review, so scratch that!  Service here has always been impeccable and friendly. From the minute you step into the restuarant you are greeted by a hostess, then transferred to your table, greeted by your server, waited on by bussers and checked up on by a supervising maitre d'. On special occassions they'll even have a couple of hostesses that greet you upon entering the restaurant only to 'lei' you! Yeah!  So after having the opportunity to meet chef partner Percy Oani, he totally did us up with the Shanghai Style \"Filipino\" Lumpia and the Crispy Karaage Calamari. This was IN ADDITION to the edamame that comes with a garlic/peppers seasoning, and on the house, mind you! The lumpia comes cut like an order or sushi does, but was stuffed with lobster and topped with a sweet chili garlic shoyu (soy) sauce. Absolutely Solid. But it was the calamari, which I know you can get just about anywhere, that was over the top. This appetizer came with a yuzu aioli and pesto sauce that is TO DIE FOR... I don't like to put mayo on anything. EVER. But once you call it 'aioli,' I'll dip my fingers in the shiz and be lickin for days! And this yuzu aioli is one of those things I wanna bottle up and put on EVERYTHING!  After our appetizers came a Mango & Papaya Salad, which was solid. And being at Roy's, I just always feel like I have to go with a fish for dinner, and we did - the Misoyaki Butterfish and the Teppan Grilled Island Ono. The Butterfish was reminiscent of a miso chilean sea bass I've had at a few other restaurants, but this fish seems to have a little more fat (always good!) and a little more oil. Yum! Although I did not try the Ono, that plate was licked clean as well!  And finally, even after every appetizer was inhaled, salad and fish consumed, we still had to order dessert. Even though there was no more room, even after we loosened our belts, bring on the chocolate souffle and the upside down pineapple cake! Again, the plate licked clean!  And once you think you've taken in the kindness of the restaurant and all it has to offer, our wonderful server Brittany, so kindly calls a taxi for us, just to remind us that not only are we getting an incredible meal here, but the service too, is just as incredible!"}
{"text":"Every once in a while, I will be treated to a nice dinner and a medical talk - this was one of those times.....  Let's just start with saying that rollin up to a JW Marriott in a Chevy Cobalt really makes all the Beemers and Benz's pop out. After non-valeting my ride and walking the mandatory 100 yards to get to the resort, my breath was already taken away by the sheer grandiosity of the resort and the colorful flowers. Roy's is on the first floor of the resort...which will throw you off because the ground floor is considered the 2nd level.  Hostess and wait staff were super friendly, I wasn't sure what the reservation was under but they made the situation light and directed me to where I needed to go. Started off with the Crunchy Golden Lobster Potstickers in a Togarashi Miso Butter Sauce...Yeah, I don't know what togarashi is, but I think he was in the hot dog eating competition at coney island last year. Either way, it was good - the perfect amount of sauce to complement the lobster meat. Definitely a must try.   Also had the Golden Coconut Shrimp that came with a Mustard Mango Sweet & Sour Sauce and that I could've done without. The shrimp tasted fresh, but overall I thought it may have been a little bland. I guess I like a little bit more spice or lemony kick to my shrimp. I probably would have like to try the calamari instead.  The last appetizer I had was the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi and I could have eaten this all day long. Hands down the number one appetizer to try. I never eat Ahi, but the wasabi kick did just enough for me to go back for 2nds and 3rds.  For the actual dinner, I started off with what seemed like the house salad. For this salad, you will need a knife in addition to your fork. It's not often I get confused by food, but I literally had to slice each piece of lettuce because it comes as one big piece. The herb dressing was super good and made the salad. You only get a couple of tomatoes and cucumber slices, but hey - your salad isn't supposed to be filling, so I was okay with it.  For the main entree, I got the Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi....and with that I will make a qualifying statement that I don't eat much fish. I prefer beef and chicken over fish during every day of the week, but since the ahi sushi roll was so good, I decided to get a little fishy. I will also say that I've never had Mahi Mahi before, but for as much fun as it is to say Mahi Mahi, it tasted just as fun as it sounds. It has the perfect amount of \"crusty-ness\" and it just flaked and melted in my mouth. The Mahi Mahi comes layered on top of grilled asparagus, which is layered on top of medium sliced roasted potatoes. One bite - multiple tastes - and it all works. Usually I'm a little hesitant when chef's try to combine too much different flavors into one bite, but it really worked with this entree.   Finished up with a dessert platter and the best one was the cheesecake, the crust was the best part. Pair it with the coffee and you've got a great ending.  P.S. Just because it's a chain, doesn't always mean that the restaurant is bad!"}
{"text":"We frequent Roy's often. The food is always spot on, until this evening. Wife and son ordered fish, I ordered filet - medium.  Fish was cooked to perfection. Can't say that for my steak. First appeared rare. Sent it back. Steak came back with outer skin very warm but center still rare. Send it back again. 3rd time steak is butterflied, I'm ok with that as long as the steak is not over cooked. Well it was well done.  Manager \"Steve\" never came to table to address this disaster. I sat and watched my family eat a great dinner. I'm happy they enjoyed dinner. Wish I could have did the same.  It will be a while before we think about going back."}
{"text":"Great food, incredible service! The waiters are like magic. You never get below a half of the drink in your glass. High priced, small portions but amazing quality and flavor. Have to try at least once. Don't forget to try the chocolate desert!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I was just as impressed the second time, if not more so. The servers are professional, attentive and knowledgeable, and the food, while pricey, is very well-crafted.  Highlights from our trip (YMMV depending on season) included: * the shellfish sampler - a bit small on quantity but sky-high on quality, with a perfect risotto and two terrific sauces. * the garlic-mustard short ribs - moist and tender short rib with a wonderful char and accompanying sauce. Great with a red from the nice wine list. * Chocolate soufflé - lovely crust with a molten center. A must-have.  Roy's is not a high-value proposition in terms of quantity of food, but you absolutely get your money's worth in the other arenas.  They will also do some special touches, such as preparing a special menu page as a memento if you tell them that you are celebrating a birthday."}
{"text":"Went to this location for the first time on a date....I really wish the Scottsdale location was still open because the quality felt alot better there even though it was twice as far of a drive for me. That being said...it wasn't a disaster...just didn't live up to my expectations from previous visits to other Roy's locations.    For an appetizer we got the Szechuan Pork Ribs which is still a favorite of mine here and I swear I would eat a whole rack of that. No complaints there. For the entree I got Ahi tuna and my date got the butterfish from my recommendation as I remember that being really good. I understand quality food takes time...and maybe I was really hungry as I was at the gym prior to coming here but it felt like ages before we got our food....seriously like 30-40 minutes or so from when we ordered it...I feel that is pretty long. I think our server forgot to put our order in until like 15 minutes have gone by.   By the time our food arrived I was full on bread but I can always make room for delicious!....problem was...they forgot the delicious in my Ahi...it was dry and bland...I was disappointed...I tried to like it...I even didn't send it back at first even though my date kept insisting....but after taking a bite of her butterfish I realized what i was missing...so I sent it back and got the butterfish....which was just as good as I remembered.   For dessert as allways...the chocolate souffle which is always a favorite.   All in all the reason I'm giving 3 stars is the speed of food delivery and the blandness of the Ahi. I will come again and will re-review when I go back...i just hope for a better visit next time.   PS: Both my drink and my date's drink were delicious. I got the pineapple mojito and she got a melon margarita."}
{"text":"For bring such a fancy restaurant I was pretty disappointed with my meal here. The service was great but food was mediocre at best. I had the sea bass which was mushy and appetizers weren't so great. The egg rolls were soggy, lobster dumplings were good, ribs were good and tender and calamari was bland. Overall for the price I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio for drinks and ate $7 appies.  The service was great and the food was decent.   The signature entrees looked tasty and were what most of the people were ordering."}
{"text":"Very good - the food was as pleasant to look at on the plate as it was to eat.  We sat outside @ the JW Marriott Desert Ridge - a cool night, and the fire pit we sat by was perfect - romance was in the air.  Ordered an excellent Moet Chandon bottle of Champagne and luxuriated in the taste, the smells, and the exquisite mouthfeel of both the bubbly as well as each other's necks as we sipped our drinks. Our appetites soon got the best of us, so we ordered a beautiful appetizer made up of four of Roy's best creations - the whole thing was perfect.  We decided this was heaven - sitting outside, cool temp's, warm fire, cold Champagne, and a lot of cannodling - what a fantastic memory - you cannot have my friend as your companion, but you can try to replicate our experience - go to Roy's @ Desert Ridge - now - and have fun."}
{"text":"Great service and nice atmosphere.  Didn't like the apps very much but the Waygu Burger was probably the best burger I've had in Phoenix area!  Chocolate souffle is a must try too!"}
{"text":"Rarely do I get the chance to post a five star review but everything was excellent at Roy's on Saturday night.  It was my girlfriend's mom's 82nd birthday and they could not have been more gracious or hospitable.  It started with menus that were special for our table wishing her a Happy Birthday, waiters that catered and understood how 80+ year olds are and did everything they could to make us comfortable.  The waiter even showed up with a camera, took a group shot of all of us at the table and then came back with the pic and a nice little frame as a memento of the night.  Plus they took those one page additions to our menu and rolled them all up and gave them to her.  OH YEAH, and the food was great as well.  Presentation was excellent, hot and flavorful.  Under the \"you get what you pay for\" column, Roy's delivers!"}
{"text":"We ventured to this Hawaiian fusion restaurant in Vegas a few years ago. I remember feeling excited about trying this place since I have read reviews about it and the rating was pleasing. My first expression of the whole atmosphere of the restaurant was I felt comfortable. A 3-star rating because I had high hopes about their food, but I was a bit disappointed. I wouldn't mind going back, but this time I will try it close to home."}
{"text":"I've been to Roy's in SF and Roy's in LV. Both are really good Asian Fusion restuarants! Service is consistent. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour!!! (or Aloha Hour as they like to call it)   The Original Hawaiian Martini is amazing and only $5 during happy hour. In fact everything on their happy hour menu is $5 so there are no surprises! Food is great and quick! You could fill up on a pretty cheap bill.  Food items range from sushi to sliders... delicious!   This is the place to go if you want more than just the typical happy hour food."}
{"text":"We went here New Years Eve. We ordered $400 worth of lobster and steak. Then.. the lobster came out stuffed with crab and upon cracking the claw we found the meat to be completely raw still blue in color. We asked the waitress who was very accommodating to bring this to the chef who preceded to tell her it was fully cooked. He then left for the night we were told. Appetizers and dessert were great and whole meal was comped. It had potential and we believe it just may have been a rush service toward the end of the night however serving completely raw lobster is dangerous. Manager and server were very understanding which is why this isn't a 1 rating."}
{"text":"Great Asian Fusion restaurant. Wonderful food. Live Music on Saturday, shout out to Jared Blackstone. Dan is the best server, very attentive and professional. Try the Butterfish. Melt in your mouth amazing. For dessert, the Molten Chocolate Lava Souffle. YUM."}
{"text":"I have always liked this restaurant and have been there before. So we made it our choice for a family Christmas dinner a bit early. I had a table next to what I assumed was a private dining area with a large party that was distracting so that was a bit unfortunate. I always get the Butter Fish which was melt-in-your-mouth wonderful. However my husband got the Trio as did another person and they felt the Butter Fish was great but the other two fish selections were just mediocre. The pineapple upside cake was good but not outstanding as I would have expected. I guess it was because it was the holiday but I felt the server rushed us through the meal. She even delivered the check while we were still eating dessert. Without alcohol the bill for two people was $125.00 so it's truly a commitment to eat there. And, for that price I was to be wowed; which we weren't. So I think I'll try other high-end restaurant for my next special occasion."}
{"text":"Friends invited me to dinner at Roy's after prom pictures of our kids. The resort was beautiful. We landed a table on the patio. Wow, thought we were in Hawaii on vacation. Some fire fountain off in the distance and tiki torches around us and a fire pit nearby. Amazing palm trees that looked like they been growing for 50 years. Gorgeous setting. My friends ate, I had a glass of the Merlot house wine, but it was perfect. My friends had a surf and turf meal and a tri-fish meal including butter fish, which they raved about all through dinner. I did taste the pineapple upside down cake, which was melt in your mouth delicious.  A couple got engaged at the table next to us. A very wonderful evening with friends. Romantic atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  I had the lobster bisque - delicious, good amount of lobster and not too heavy; and the shellfish sampler.  It was just the right amount.  Melissa, the server, was great.  However, this Roy's gets only three stars from me because the three people at the host stand (yes three) were all very cold and rude.  As a solo diner, they first sent me to the bar.  However there were no seats.  Then they coldly said nothing was available for an hour.  So I left.  But I was able to book a reservation using open table for 15 minutes from then.  They were even MORE rude when I returned.  Management needs to address their attitude.  It is costing them money - or maybe they don't care about that.  I will also inform the JW Marriott."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor seating inside hotel resort.  Nice torches, fire pit, live music.  I feel like I am in the island.  The sauces are too much unless you like salt."}
{"text":"My coworker and I sat outside at the fire pit and had a great experience. Friendly service, delicious food, big portions. The $36 tasting menu was a great value. I had the green salad, short rib and pineapple upside down cake And my friend had the grilled Cesar,roasted chicken and the lava cake. We left so full and happy we chose Roy's."}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  Excellent staff.  Can not tell you how nice and patient and helpful they were with making choices.  Service was quick.  Whenever we needed something they were right there.  No need to hunt them down.  Great for family.  We went with our two sons (11 and 13) .  They brought out a plate for each of them with appetizers on the house to hold them over until the food got there.  They both loved their dinners and again brought out dessert on the house (with their names written in chocolate).  They also did the family photo as the other reviewers mentioned.  What a nice touch.  We never bring out camera anywhere so to get a photo every now and then of the family is a big deal.  Our entire family loved everything we ordered.  You can't go wrong.  We tried several appetizers and shared entrees so that we could taste everything so order away you wont be disappointed.  If you are not sure of a dish they couldn't be better about describing it to you.  Even the kids meals are excellent grilled salmon, what a treat for my son. (Not mac and cheese or microwaved pizza)  My favorite the lobster california roll.  Wow.  Everyone would have been happy to return the very next night.  Total bill with wine and appetizers $150 but you definitely need to add on the appropriate tip because the service is excellent.  Off the strip but not out of the way by any means.  A must try."}
{"text":"I am doing this off memory so I will be brief.  Very very good stuff.  I had the mahi mahi and it was so yummy and buttery.  A true dining experience.   And bring lots of money."}
{"text":"I had always heard this restaurant had great deserts, but that's all I ever heard.  Finally came here last night.  I got the Lilikoi salad, the Hawaiian style Butterfish, and the chocolate souffle.  The butterfish is like a sea bass if I had to explain it to someone.  Whatever is in this misoyako makes this dish memorable.  Hands down I would tell anyone to order this fish and the group should share this dessert.  Service is phenomenal.  The restaurant is beautiful.  I don't care if this is a chain, because it doesn't feel like one."}
{"text":"Remarkable customer service!!!   My husband & I went for my birthday, the entire staff wished me happy birthday, our server was very knowledgeable & recommended great dishes.  They provided a happy birthday dessert & even took a picture of us & framed it. The food was delicious & didn't take long.  Great experience, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at this Roy's a number of times and normally I would give it at least 4 stars. Unfortunately we tried it on Valentines day this year and the experience was not what we expected. Due to the heavy volume they had a done a fixed menu. The problem was allot of the food had obviously been made a head of time as it was luke warm and less then fresh. For a meal that was over $100 per person out the door I expected more."}
{"text":"Roy's is one of my favorite restaurants. My wife and I dined at the original location in Oahu when we got married; that's how much we enjoy Roy's. We plan to go back for our anniversary dinner each year.  Each location has a slightly different menu so when I was in Phoenix for a business trip I wanted to make sure to get the chef's specials for this location. I had the lobster sushi roll and lobster pot stickers for appetizers, and the Himalayan Sea Salt Ribeye with a side of scallops for the entree. Although I love Roy's I have to say the steak wasn't that great. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly, but the cut of meat had too much connective tissue I had to work around. The scallops were wonderful, soft and tender and very flavorful.   I've been here so many times with 5 star experiences that I'm averaging it out to 4 stars for this review."}
{"text":"Hubby and I wanted to eat without spending a fortune. Not that easy to do in Las Vegas these days. Roys has a great HH, they call Aloha Hour. $6 for about 6 different appetizer choices. We tried 4 of them: beef sliders with sweet potato fries - delish!, Mahi mahi taco - so, so (really could have used some additional sauce, meat was pretty tasteless), Lobster potsticker - really really good, great sauce! and the BEST EVER - Tempura crusted Ahi roll. Seriously this thing is sinfully good!! We had the 1988 cocktail and the Mai Tai, both great cocktails. This place was definitely worth the price with great service and a really luxe atmosphere. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour.  $5 cocktails and $5 appetizers.  The best part is that there must have been about 7 food items and 15 drinks to choose from.  All well worth 5 bucks a pop.  The tenderloin skewers and sliders were standouts.  Service was excellent all around.  Get there early to snag a table.  If I lived closer I would be a regular."}
{"text":"We hosted a 50th anniversary celebration at Roy's.  It was simply amazing!!!  We arrived earlier than expected and they accommodated us while we enjoyed Hawaiian martinis for Aloha Hour in the bar.  The meals were excellent and very flavorful.  If you have a special occasion dinner coming up, I highly recommend contacting the sales manager Kathryn.  She did a fabulous job organizing the event.  Our waitstaff was very attentive and accommodating as well.  The evening was perfect!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!"}
{"text":"First off I can start with wow, wow and wow!  This place is very great with their service, clean and very upscale. My fiancé and I had started off with a drink called Hawaiian Martini it tasted quite similar to a pina colada which is my favorite drink ever. We had ordered lobster bisque soup which was delicious be aware it has a hint of a little spiciness to it but nothing extreme. We then had a couple of champagne glasses come out. I thought oh they have a drink special menu but it turned out it was a card with my name on it from my fiancé and as I had opened it and read the card the last bit saying \"look up\" he had proposed to me. It was the perfect atmosphere and place to do it. I am extremely happy. He had planned this way before with the manager and they did a great job setting it all up.  A bit later our entrees had came out.  My fiancé ordered the filet minion and I had ordered hibachi grilled Atlantic salmon. Everything was cooked to perfection. Our waters were kept full at all times. After our dinner was done   Dessert had came out which was the melting hot chocolate soufflé. That has been the most delicious mouth watering dessert I have ever had."}
{"text":"We were staying at the JW Desert Ridge and decided that we didn't want to ride out to look for a restaurant after a long day, so we went with Roy's, a no brainier since all we had to do was dress up and go down stairs. When we arrived we asked if we could sit outside, good decision, it was cool this night and they had the fire pits and torches going, great ambiance under the stars. My wife and I had the salmon and the Mahi Mahi, these were both  great choices. Don't remember what we had for desert but it was something chocolatey, this was suggested by the waiter, and very,very good choice. I have to say this was up there with some of our favorite restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We came here with the same high expectations as last year but today, the food came out very slow and with the wrong cook and also very salty. We are very disappointed with the food quality and the slow service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Arizona for a business trip we stayed in the JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge Resort & Spa and we decided to try the Roys as its one of our favorite restaurant! We tried already the one in Pasadena and the one in San diego and it was always an amazing experience. I have to say that David our server was amazing very friendly and always around to make sure we receive the good service. Food was great as I was expecting. As a started we too the Ahi to share the Roy's Original Blackened Island Ahi* Spicy Soy Mustard it was perfect fresh and flavorful, For the main course I took the fish, the Tempura Alaskan Black Cod with Cilantro Citrus Sauce, Black Rice, Quinoa, Cucumber it was delicious.  My husband took the Braised Short Ribs of Beef with Natural Braising Sauce, Honey Mustard, Yukon Mash, Broccolini this was soooo good I just almost eat it all as well as my fish! I recommend the place its outstanding FOOD is great SERVICE perfect AMBIANCE very charming and romantic. Good for business meeting , date, anniversary, birthday or good with kids as well. Its not noisy just perfect."}
{"text":"Known for their butter fish, chocolate soufflé is the best place to have dinner and feel As you in Hawaii!!"}
{"text":"Awesome dining experience. Called ahead to mention my sister's birthday! everyone and I do mean everyone made her night very special! I can not thank all enough for that! the food the wine the exceptional service made the evening heavenly for 2 old broads. So thank you!"}
{"text":"We tried out Roy's for the first time last night, and had a fantastic meal in a great environment. I *definitely* recommend the trout, it was the best I've ever had. I was expecting Roy's to be sort of chainy and cheap, but it is incredibly classy and unique.  The atmosphere in Roy's is wonderful. Hawaiian meets mid-century modern. Love it. The wait staff was very attentive, and even when they messed up our order (more than once actually), they fixed it immediately so that it wasn't a problem at all. Everything arrived quickly, even though they had a huge party in the next room.  We split the fixed price menu and added an extra appetizer, although we really didn't need it! One order of the fixed price menu is enough for 2 people unless you've just hiked Camelback or something. We started with the calamari, which was perfectly done, and came with a macadamia nut bruschetta-like topping and a spicy dipping sauce. We also had the pork tenderloin on the fixed price menu. Very tasty, but the calamari was better. Our entree was the trout, which as I said was phenomenal. The desert was the cheesecake, which I thought was a little overly rich. But, still, this was the best meal I've had in Ahwatukee/Chandler,"}
{"text":"Roy's is a GREAT Go-To place for any special occasion you may have. The service is impeccable, and ALL the food is Fantastic. The Aloha Hour lets you try out the menu on a budget even. This is a must try restaurant!   Thanks TJ and Red."}
{"text":"We made a reservation through Open Table to celebrate our Anniversary, we wrote on the reservation the motive of our visit...our table was the only one without light candle, the waiter \"noticed\" maybe 20 minutes after we arrived and just \"drop it\" inside of the candle like a coin. Not carefully not attentive, didn't placed the candle on the Center for us or at least smiled..nothing...   I think I'm used to be greeted better? By the hostess and the waiters? Specially at this kind of restaurants where yo pay $60-70 per person right? And well I was expecting at least more friendly and attentive service.  The ambience is just ok, nothing fancy, and dark, very dark I hate how the pictures from the food came out...  Also I can tell the place must be old and they haven't invest in renovations for a while... the ceiling had some problems with the rain or the a/c I wasn't able to tell but there was a hole on the ceiling and the paint was coming off... one of the plates that I got was really scratched and still being used..I mean I will not complain if this is a Hole in the Wall cheap kind a restaurant...but we are paying right?  The music was annoying, very repetitive and the rhythm was accelerated like music that you hear at a fast food place... I don't know I was expecting a more relaxed and soft kind of music... We visited on a Sunday, arrived at 4:30 by 5:00 the place started to get more costumers and became noisy...so keep that in mind. Besides that the kitchen is on a corner and they don't have doors which makes you listen all the noise of the cooking and the handling of the plates...yeah my romantic dinner was romantic because of my husband, that's it the environment didn't help it to make it a perfect celebration how I expected.  The food was salty and I wish they added more vegetables   I'm really disappointed, when we married in Koo Olina our celebration was at Roy's Restaurant and everything was perfect,the food, the service...so celebrating our Wedding Anniversary on this other Roy's made sense to us... However I really regret to try to celebrate on this restaurant my anniversary"}
{"text":"Hawaiian Fusion...mmmm....good.  Their sushi rolls (loved the Lakanilau - the accompanying sauce is to die for) make great appetizers, and the chocolate souffle is a MUST for dessert.  Cocktails are pricey but very tasty.  We liked the capirhina and the sangria.  I had the Shellfish Sampler ($33.95), which came with 2 large pieces of shrimp and 2 large scallops as well as part of a lobster tail with risotto.  Doesn't sound like a lot of food, but it's quality of quantity with this meal.  So good.  My husband had the Roy's Trio ($30.95) w/ hibachi salmon, blackened ahi, and misoyaki butterfish.  He loved it and says he would definitely, definitely get it again.  Our group ordered a variety of things, but I also want to add that if you're not necessarily in the seafood mood, my friend ordered the beef short ribs and nearly passed out from shear joy.  Said it was the best ribs he'd ever had."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with Happy Hour.   The Schechuan spicy pork ribs and the lobster potstickers were not too bad but my martini only filled 1/2 the glass, the tempura-crusted ahi roll was bland and mushy and they overcharged us when the bill came.   At one time Roy's was one of my very favorite restaurants but at this point I don't know if I will ever return."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere in the bar area and the dining area. I had no idea this was a chain restaurant and you couldn't tell by the menu. The calamari was the best I've ever had, in my life, and will always compare calamari to this. In fact I will probably never order calamari again unless it is at Roy's and I'm not joking. Our waiter, Danny, was great and very informative. I couldn't decide on what to order so he literally ordered everything for me from apps to dessert which I thought was a fun surprise each time he brought something to our table. The wine selection is great. We ordered a malbec which was top of the line. The Butter fish is highly recommended here, but wasn't what I expected. It was not bad at all, but I almost wish I would have tried something else on the menu. I would recommend this restaurant, my waiter Danny and their happy hour which is half off apps and 2-for-1 martinis. Yummy."}
{"text":"From the hostesses to the waitress, everything was just wrong. This was my first time in this location, and it will be my last. They need lots of training in customer service and guest satisfaction. They think they got it, but leaving someone standing at the entry without acknowledging, and sitting them next to dirty tables, and waitressses that look at you all weird and managers that respond like if they are so important that they cannot have \"bread\" because they are too \"elegant\" is not really nice service.... It is not!"}
{"text":"went for a celebratory dinner- great service, accommodated food allergies, great food.  we hadn't been there in a long time but we will definitely go back soon!  love the chocolate souffle, the ahi, the ono, the salads...you name it!"}
{"text":"Good and bad to say about this restaurant. It was our first time at Roy's. We ate at the Happy hour where all of the appys are $5! We tried the Wagyu Beef Sliders, Big Island Ebi Roll and Lobster Potstickers. All were good portion sizes and excellent. Couldn't have better service from the time we walked in. Note we made reservations an hour before for dinner! Of course it was a weekday. People were dressed up for the most part but then there was people in shorts, resort wear, casual too. For dinner we had a booth seat (highly recommend!). Dinner was the surf & terf + Shellfish sampler. Here is where the good and bad come in. The steak was luke warm almost cold. The crab on the surf & terf was barely there. For the Shellfish sampler I could of done without the crab cake (not good at all). The U-10 Sea Scallop was amazing! It melted in my mouth! The best fresh scallops we've ever had! They give you edamame as an appy for free seasoned with some spice and salt. So wonderful! This was a happening place! You can tell this is where the locals go. With three appys, two happy hour beers, ice tea and two dinners our bill came to $125 with tip. We'd go back but hope someone from the restaurant reads this. Once again best service from the time we walked in to the time we left."}
{"text":"Wow! Great ambiance, fun/knowledgeable servers and great food. From the time our party of 6 entered the door, we were treated like royalty. We had previously called and their nationally rated executive chef cooked for us what must have been a 10 course truly amazing meal. Eclectic, artfully presented various Asian fusion dishes, each one a true taste delight. Chef Patrick even visited our table multiple times to make sure we were enjoying his creations. This restaurant, guided by their wonderful Chef Patrick, is not to be missed.  ."}
{"text":"Stick with the fish...corporate \"dining\" gone bad.  The highs: butterfish and salmon entrees were excellent as was the service by  Stephanie (We had to verify her name at end of the meal as the check only identified Stephanie by a number...how bad is that!)  The lows: the dim sum pork belly appetizer was all chewy dough and no discernible pork flavor, much less actual pork.  After attempting.to enjoy the first of 4, we carefully dissected the next two and, alas, there was no pork to be found.  Truly pathetic.  We mentioned this to Stephanie and she immediately and graciously offered a chocolate soufflé for desert at no charge.  Another low: the 60% martini.  The \"up\" martini arrived with the glass slightly over half full, which seemed rather unusual.   Another low:  while the seared ahi appetizer contained excellent fresh fish one of the two sauces, on the side, had absolutely no flavor.  Another low: poorly trained staff.  The bartender, if properly trained, would not have made a 60% martini, Stephanie, if properly trained, would not have served it and other table servers would have removed dirty dishes and not tried to remove dishes with food on them.  One last low: the big Happy Hour poster in the outer lobby needs to be read closely if it was a drawing card as it only includes some very basic selections.    Overall impression:  great fish, pleasant server who would benefit from some additional training, poorly trained and/or performing bartender and other service personnel.  Proceed with caution."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant ever.  I'm so glad this isn't the only one around.  One word: Butterfish. This entree was so tender and well flavored. Spicy complimentary edamame was a fun and tasty surprise. Also had the appetizer taster plate-  each part was so good(garnishes too) we cleaned the plate with a spoon. Service was positive & amazing. Will be returning."}
{"text":"I first ate at Roys a few years back in Honolulu... So I was pretty excited to have one here in PHX, when my job brought me to the valley. Good seafood in the valley.. Yay!  Superb service... ask away, the waiters never seem to lose patience or get snippy.. they know the product and the wines..  There isnt a thing on the menu that I dont like.. I havent tried everything.. but whenever friends from out of town come in.. This is one of my first suggestions.. My fav is the butterfish.. and the pineapple dessert.. all the other things are wonderful ... In other words... your not gonna go wrong here. Hey its Roy Yamaguchi..  for Gods sake.. and he can fuse and cook like no other.."}
{"text":"It's been over a year and we are becoming regulars. The menu always changes but everything is delicious and so flavorful. Well worth every penny spent there. We recently went for our 3 year wedding anniversary and Cory was our server. He was wonderful, kind, and respectful. He took a picture of us which he gave us in a Roy's frame. Very special.  I had the crab dynamite swordfish and every bite was a flavor explosion and the fish was so tender. This is the 2nd time I've had it and I'll prob get it again. Thank you to all the people who make Roy's possible!"}
{"text":"CONDENSED IN A SOUP CAN: Stay away from the sushi rolls and you will be one happy camper.  They also have an awesome selection of $5-6 food and drink items during their happy hour (4:30-6pm).  THE MEAT: The main reason why I wanted to go to Roy's was I saw on a food show that they have given birth to the seared tuna dish, and that they do it very well.  In spite of being a franchise that has been mushroomed around the world from Hawaii in 1988, and as their serving dishes shall suggest a probable need for presentation updates, they have managed to maintain consistently high reviews from customers.  I was excited to try it for the very first time.  Aside from the very cute (colored) coloring comic book, the first pleasant surprise was a free nibbling platter they handed my toddler as soon as we were settled with our drinks - Cheese quesadillas, carrots, celery, apples and a ranch dip.  I ADORE places that pay attention to these details in cheering up the customers.    We ordered the Ahi Poke (pretty good, but the nori chips had sat out too long and were chewy), the Schezuan spiced pork ribs (fatty, tender and tasty goodness), the Ebi roll topped with tuna (they had unfortunately discontinued Auntie Lei's Roll with hamachi, and this was what the waiter had suggested... although the shrimp was large and fresh, it was still quite disappointing.. stick to sushi joints for sushi rolls), the Mai Tai (was excellent, the cocktails on the other tables looked damn good as well), and finally the Blackened Ahi.  We ordered the appetizer portion and when it came out, it didn't look very pretty.  But one bite of the tuna with the spiced crust and sweet/salty sauce and I was in heaven.  It was a large piece of good tuna, only ever so slightly spiced and seared, and it was perfection.  Well, we had to ask for extra dipping sauce to achieve nirvana.  We had no more room to try the butterfish and chocolate soufflé.  Definitely good reasons to go back, together with repeats for the Blackened Ahi.  And perhaps an abuse of the happy hour with a group of friends.  I'M STILL DIGESTING... The fact that the interiors of the main dining area was uberly dim.  Makes me feel like I'm in an 80s restaurant.  Good for hiding zits or mistresses.  We stayed in the beautiful porch outdoors.

{"text":"In comparison to San Francisco's Roy's Restaurant, the service at the Las Vegas Roy's leaves not much to be desired. I am used to getting in and out under an hour for business power lunches in the SF Financial District. Who knew a dinner at Roy's would take 2.5+ hours.  Again, compared to the SF location, the food at the LV location was alright. The $39 prix fixe three course dinner has the same proportions as the regular menu items. A good value. Lukewarm. The slightly redeeming quality was that they sent two scoops of ice cream stacked on top of each other with a lit candle as the snowman's arm for the bachelorette. I say slightly because who the heck sends a snowman over for any occasion!?!?!? Sure, leave it to the imagination. I was really confused by their hospitable gesture.  Since the restaurant is off the strip, cabs are scarce. Half an hour before the end of dinner, we asked the host to call a taxi on our behalf. By the time we were done paying our bill, the host still had not called the cab. My friend braved the wide streets and crazily flagged down a cab faster than the host ultimately called a cab."}
{"text":"Have been to this Roy's on Flamingo twice, both times with our kids ages 6 and 9. This is one of the only restaurants I can think of that successfully caters to kids but keeps things really sophisticated at the same time. We were here last year for our kids birthday dinner, and had a really special and memorable experience!! They ask for the kids' names when you arrive (or prior) and write their names in chocolate when they serve the souffles (make sure you order the souffle 20 minutes in advance of when you want it!).   They also take a picture and print it out in a frame for you and sign the back, which is a great little memory of the experience. The kids activity books are really cool, too... and are big enough to keep them busy for awhile.  The food is melt in your mouth good. It's seriously fantastic. I had the butterfish both times, because Roy's butterfish is the best. And if you love short ribs - OMG. The short ribs! They are even available on the kids menu, which is awesome. My older daughter got an adult meal (halibut) and really enjoyed it. Did I mention to NOT forget to get the chocolate souffle?  I hate sweet mixed drinks, but really wanted a cocktail before dinner... I explained to our server what I like and she suggested the The \"Hapa\" Margarita-Martini\". It has Fresh Lemon & Lime Juice, Jameson's Irish Whiskey, Grand Marnier & Agave. It is literally the best mixed drink I've ever tasted and am dying to try making it at home! It's perfect.  My only complaint on this past visit is that they served my younger daughter's kids meal way before the adults were served - so we asked them to take it away & bring it back when everyone was served. This is a great place to teach kids to eat like civilized young adults, so serving everyone at the same time makes sense.   I love that Roy's uses OpenTable to book reservations. What a convenience! I wish every restaurant used it. Attention to detail is what a 5 star experience is about, and Roy's delivers on every level!"}
{"text":"The bf took me here during a one night stop through Vegas. OMFG can you say DELISH! I'm pretty sure he had an orgasm his butterfish was so damn good. My Mahi was just as tasty and the glass of pino, perfect! We sat at the bar and struck up a convo with the pastry chef there. She was pretty cool. Totally worth the moola spent! You MUST visit this place."}
{"text":"The ambience was very nice  The sea food was delicious I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I have yet to have a bad meal.  The food is so flavorful and delicious.  The only problem that I have when visiting Roy's is deciding what I should order."}
{"text":"What happened to Roy's?? Their butterfish used to be to die for and now it's a defrosted slice of mush. The edamame comes from a freezer bag. Even the salmon which is a normally a no-fail standby ended up tasting disappointing. The service was so slow. If it takes you that long to take my drink order and then to bring my drink order there is no way the evening is going to get back on track. Nope. The dessert cake even came out burned. Ugh. I can't believe we paid money for this."}
{"text":"It was decent and fun to have this asian fusion of a menu.  I met here with old friend's from college. The server was great. The drinks delicious.  I got a yelp free welcome drink. That was a plus.  The food was decent. But it wasn't high end enough or commercialized enough to get a 4 star.  If it was more commercialized and outlandish it would be a novelty type place. If it was chic-er it could be considered upscale.  The food could have been good for either. But the ambiance for me made it a bit not either...  Food: decent Waitstaff: good Ambiance: confused....  This is like a 3.5 for me..."}
{"text":"The food we had tonight was pretty bad. I ordered the filet mignon, and it was covered with this sauce that was SO salty. After the first bite, I had lost my appetite. I scraped off as much of the sauce as I could, but it was still so salty. My wife ordered the bacon crusted salmon as part of the three course set meal. The salmon was also pretty salty. Her set meal came with a bread pudding dessert that was horrible. It was hard as a rock, cold, and felt like it was a week old. I ordered the pineapple upside down cake. I thought that also was mediocre at best. I didn't taste any pineapple in the cake. It came with coconut ice cream, but it was so dry, it tasted like it was several years old. The service was good, the waiter was very apologetic when I mentioned how salty the sauce was. We won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic \"Aloha hour\". Great food and beverage selection. Adrian in the bar was especially attentive. Great place for locals plus only 1 mile from the strip."}
{"text":"Absolutly made my anniversary night with my wife spectacular! A must for any romantic. Excellent service, keepsake menu's and food that will make your toung twirl like the north shore."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner to celebrate my Dad's 80th birthday and the food and service were both excellent. They went out of their way to make us feel special in a way that DIDN'T include obnoxious singing of lame birthday tunes. John (with ponytail) was our server, and was fun without being too over the top.   We all had various combinations of the shellfish and salmon, and all were perfectly cooked and flavorful. For dessert, you will want to try their flourless chocolate soufflé. It has molten chocolate inside and vanilla ice cream, with a berry sauce. One of the best restaurant desserts I've had in a while. The atmosphere is a little noisy, but not so much that you can't have a conversation.   All-in-all, they did a great job!"}
{"text":"Love this place :) Hubby & I ate here this past Saturday for our 10yr anniversary.  They personalized our menu with an anniversary wish.  We ordered their calamari appetizer, which was A-MAY-ZING!  It was marinated in some sort of soy-ginger marinade and drizzles with some sort of sauce.  for our entrees, hubby ordered the fish trio, which consisted of salmon, mahi mahi, & butterfish, each prepared differently from one another.  I had the shellfish sampler- (1) lobster tail, (2) prawns (1) crab cake, & (1) large scallop on top of a bed of risotto.  It was very yummy.  The downfall from each plate:  the portion of the fish trio was small for it to be priced at $34; the crab cake was nothing special.  I've tasted better ones at Yard House.  I would have given Roy's 5 stars, but my glass of wine was filled only a quarter of my glass & my Mai Tai was a bit too lime-y for my taste, and our chocolate souffle was over baked- the chocolate didn't ooze out when we broke into it.  Service was exceptional though :) We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Add another location to my favorite Roy's Restaurant. This Roy's is located in a beautiful resort up in North Scottsdale, JW Marriott Resort and Spa. Hawaiian cuisine that you can never go wrong with.  They usually have a price fix menu on Monday's, which is always worth it!"}
{"text":"If I could rate different aspects of this meal I would. The service was definately lacking at this Roy's-and we have been to a few since they have a gluten free menu.   I felt bad for our waiter-he didn't understand the gluten free aspect and messed up the order at first and the final bill.   He apologized but it was more of me telling him, no the menu says this so it's this price etc etc. He came back and said \"you were right\" well duh! I usually am...jokes people!  The gluten free menu here is VERY limited, if you have been to the Roy's in baltimore you will be disappointed in this one. I think there were 5 apps you could pick from, 3-4 main courses and 2 desserts. They did not have a seperate GF drink menu.   We did the prix fixe menu. We both got the california rolls (YAY they are made with real crab instead of the wheat filled imitation). Our waiter brought us the wheat filled soy sauce, luckily he had another waiter who seemed a little more aware of gluten allergy who brought the correct soy sauce out. (Tamari)  Jason for the braised short rib-very tastey. I got the lemongrass chicken with jasimine rice and curry sauce-I love thai flavors. The chicken was lacking flavor but the rice and sauce were melt in your mouth.   We then both ordered the GF chocolate souffle. not disappointed there either.   There are 2 Roy's in vegas, we did not have the chance to go to the other one.   Service-disappointing for Roy's and the knowledge of GF was lacking. Food was still flavorful and melt in your mouth.  Many kids in this Roy's-surprising for me, the other ones we have been too are much more adult oriented."}
{"text":"I've been to many a Roy's in my day and while the overall restaurant usually gets a 4-star rating in my book, this location gets 3 stars.  The food was good, but it left me feeling unsatsified.  The service was also lacking (read: waiter had attitude).  Positives: -Calamari appetizer with yuzu pesto was crisp and refreshing without being rubbery -Shortrib appetizer was fall-off-the-bone tender and seasoned with a sweet, tangy glaze -Orange ginger creme brulee was light and velvety   Negatives: -Lobster potstickers...no,no, no..soggy and oily with almost no trace of lobster. -Miso butterfish; soy glaze was overdone and masked the flavor of the fish...the cut was also much fattier than usual -Rib eye; unimpressive portion with a cut that was less than tender  I like Roy's, but I'd avoid this location."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place.  I have been to Roy's at many locations and especially enjoyed the Roy's on Maui, but this is one of my favorites.  This place is amazing with a reoccurring Hawaiian theme, whats not to love!  It is a mix of European techniques and Asian cuisine while meeting Hawaiian hospitality.  Honestly, I love the Seared Ahi Tuna and get this dish most of the times come. But when I decide to change it up, I am never disappointed.  For the appetizers we loved the crunchy golden lobster pot-stickers, for the salads we loved the roasted beet salad and grilled pear salad and for the entrees (besides the Ahi Tuna) the crab dynamite baked barramundi is delicious(a little rich so be prepared),  the mahi mahi and Hawaiian style misoyaki butterfish is absolutely mouth watering!!! If you are reading this, you must go and try :)  I also heard from one of my friends that the filet mignon is one of the best around.  I have not had the chance yet to give it a whirl. So maybe a surf & turf next? Last but not least is the dessert.  This may be my favorite at any restaurant out there.  Roy's Chocolate Souffle.  A delicious chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and a tad of raspberry sauce - it literally melts in your mouth.  This is a MUST, make sure you order it!  Remember, there is always room for dessert!  Monday nights are usually a fix priced 3-course menu, so you should check it out. Great deal if they still offer.  My friend and I have dined here many times and we have had some issues in the past with take-out food, so make sure your order is correct before leaving.  ALOHA!"}
{"text":"I was completely blown away by the entire dining experience!  My mouth is still salivating from the savory appetizer: Ahi poke and delicious calamari, Hawaiian martinis was delectable, and the entrees that my family and I had were insane!  My husband tried the soy glazed ono, which just melts in your mouth and cooked to perfection.  My sister is a sushi fan, and was blown away by the sushi chef named Kazushi.  He and she talked extensively about Japan, since he is from Tokyo, and sent out many unusual dishes for her to try.  I had the shitake smoked gouda filet mignon, and loved every bite!!!  My husband did too.  We shared our meals, and all treated ourselves to the hot chocolate souflet. It was my sister's birthday, and it was also one of our favorite meals we've had in years!  The chef is attractive, hip, and adventurous with food.  He commanded a presence in the kitchen. Service was excellent.  We were tended to and made to feel very comfortable. We are all looking fw to going there for mother's day!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was completely blown away last night!!!!  Chef Patrick totally took care of us and made my mom feel so special on her birthday.  He was voted one of the Nations Top Chefs of 2013 for an obvious reason!  He's amazing!  The cocktails are scrumptious!  Yet the food was a journey of flavor, excitement, and decadence.  It started with edamame and we just kept building our taste buds with salads, calamari, pan seared scallops, pork belly, butter fish, kobe egg rolls, and dessert was heavenly.  We all felt incredibly spoiled by all these wonderful flavors and textures!  I'd recommend this restaurant even to those less adventurous foodies too.  The service was awesome!  t's just a treat for anyone.  GO!"}
{"text":"This is a great food option not too far from the Vegas strip. I've only been to this location during Happy Hour, but have been to other Roy's and would recommend it as a HH spot. They've got lots of fun, Polynesian-inspired drinks as well as some Hawaiian beer and non-alcoholic options.  My group tried pretty much everything on the Happy Hour menu, and here's the consensus: -Steamed Pork Buns- these are more sandwich-like than traditional bao, but seemed to be a hit at the table. (I don't eat pork but everyone else liked them) -Red Curry Chicken Samosas- these are delicious!! 3 to a plate so you may want a couple orders. And the dipping sauce served with them is a perfect complement. -Ebi Roll- these are a new age sushi roll, with cream cheese and all that jazz. Not my taste palate but the table gobbled 'em up. -Wagyu Burger- this was the star of the show. It's a wagyu patty served with a fried egg on a challah-like bun. It's large enough to split between 2 people (although the egg can get messy!) and comes with a few large onion rings. Not sure if what made it over-the-top delicious was the sauce, the meat, the prep...but it's one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had.  Service was ok. Happy Hour nosh was about $9 each, which is fair considering the quality.  There's a lot of good food on the strip, so I can imagine this is more of a local spot. But as a quick late afternoon airport detour or just as a mini escape, I'd recommend dining here."}
{"text":"closed!!.   why?? i thought the food was good."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, nice selections on the menu... and dinners were plated beautifully!  I recommend the Shellfish Sample which included lobster, shrimp and a scallop! I was very dissapointed in the service this evening! I announced it was my sisters birthday right as we sat down and the waitress asked what her name was.. and then the waitress never addressed the birthday again! When they picked up our salads we had to ask for clean forks since they took ours off our used plates and sat dirty forks back down on our table cloth... rather then bring us new ones! At the end of the meal she asked if we'd like dessert and we all said no... (in my mind I thought there would be some type of a birthday cake or something since I had mentioned it and made such a big deal about it being her birthday) But instead she brought the check.  I had to ask if we could sign for it on our room tab and she had to take it back to set it up so we could sign with her reply \"OH I'm sorry I didn't know you were staying here\" What does that mean? Is it less if we are guests? Do we get friendlier service if we are guests?  We paid $242 for 3 dinners, two appetizers and two glasses of wine and two sodas. Pricing is reasonable and although she was polite, she did not smile or make us feel welcome... and never once said Happy Birthday even at the end of the night. Had she originally stated we don't do anything here at Roys for birthdays then I would have ordered my sister the pineapple cake so she would have left her birthday dinner complete...  If you want great food and average service you wont be disappointed ... but if you are trying to make someone feel extra pampered on their special night then Roys didn't accomplish this and therefore I woud not put them on my list to recommend for special occasions. Very dissapointed!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I enjoyed this place! The dining experience was great. The servers treated us as if we were white regardless of our skin color. They even gave us hot towels to clean off our hands! We gave it a 4 star because the pricing was a little too high in comparison to its ambience."}
{"text":"2 stars bc of service.  Food is pretty good but not this location.  Stoneground at hotel better.  Maybe go here if you want a seafood entree.  Our server was good but hostess and manager disregarded us completely.  Sushi roll was done poorly, meat in appetizer had tendoins.  Kids fruit medley is on menu but server kept pushing sundae even after we went over no sugar for kids."}
{"text":"This is the holy grail of restaurants for parents... a place that is kid-friendly AND has good food. I didn't think it was possible. Based on all the family-friendly spots we've been to, this one has the best food. Now, I don't think it's on par with elite restaurants on the Strip, but it's still very tasty.  What really makes this place special is the value -- a happy hour (from 4:30 - 6:30) where appetizers, wine, and cocktails are $5 and Kona pale ale is $3. They also have a three course prix-fixe menu for $35.  The mixed green salad ($7.95 and not on the HH menu) was respectable, although not the sexiest dish. Both the tempura crusted spicy ahi roll and crunchy lobster potstickers were delicious fusion options worth getting again. The wagyu sliders (2 per order) were tender and juicy and sat on a pretzel-like bun. They were accompanied by garlic sweet potato fries. The biggest letdown was the salt and pepper crisped calamari. While the sweet and spicy flavor was enjoyable and the addition of macadamia nuts was a nice contrast in texture, it was a heavy dish that could have benefited from having the sauce on the side.  The kid menu isn't cheap -- at $13 -- but it does come with three courses. The appetizer is a cheese quesadilla with sliced apples, celery and carrots. There are six kid entrees to choose from. The final course is either a sundae or fresh fruit (guess which one my kid chose).  Another pleasant surprise was the quality of service. From the host and hostess to our waiter and food runners... everyone was warm and welcoming. It's almost commonplace to walk into a \"nice\" restaurant with a child and suffer poor service from employees who don't want you there. So, getting the kind of attention and friendliness that we received was shocking. That level of care will turn us into repeat customers, as there's no doubt we'll be back, whether or not it's for a family night out or a date night."}
{"text":"Fish. Yummy, yummy fish. Divine fish.   I met the most talkative barback here. I had a great convo and dinner here at around 8p, and I really liked the big fish tank with lots of colorful fish to look at.  Service is impeccable, drinks are good, and the food is tasty. I'd love coming here with a group next time, but it's also great if you're a solitary traveler in need of some quiet eat time and easy conversation."}
{"text":"Mothers Day 2017. What a F'n rip off.  A set menu.   $40 for a salad, 1/2 chicken and some potatoes.  Want a bigger rip off?     $40 for a F\"n omelette. That was suppose to have shrimp and lobster in it. PFFFFTTTTTTT      I like to treat mom on Mothers day, but man that just hurt when I looked at the menu.   Never, never, never again."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd Roy's I've experienced and to be completely honest, I was not too impressed... Although the complimentary valet is a nice feature, our reservation was pushed to the right by 10 min. Our dinner took over an hour before it made it to our table."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Roy's since I was \"forced\" to do business in Hawaii years ago. We took the in-laws to this one for a birthday and the food and service was excellent!   We started off with the Wood Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs and they were great.  My wife and I wanted \"surf and turf\" so I ordered the filet and she ordered the White Truffle & Black Pepper Seared Sea Scallops, they were excellent.  We all shared the chocolate souffle and it was delicious.   The wait staff did a really nice job as well and we thoroughly enjoyed the evening.  Will be going back and taking a client."}
{"text":"Even half off the value was just terrible and I left hungry. I have been here several times with a friend who works for the parent corporation and gets 1/2 off our bill.   With the discount I felt I could try a bit more and started my meal with an appetizer. I had the Ahi Poke, similar to a caviche small cubes of ahi came in a martini glass seasoned with some soy and garnished with a wasabi mayo. It was good but quite small.   For my meal I selected the \"Roy's classic trio\" consisting of Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Roy's Original Blackened Island Ahi & Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish. It came out with 3 small I mean small plates in a tasting style display. The Ahi was great, the spices went well with the cool raw interior. The Butter fish was nice too with a sweet miso glaze on a bed (or pillow in this case) of black rice. I thought the salmon was a bit over cooked. After I had finished the three 2oz tastings I was still hungry.   I am probably not the only one with this opinion as on both weekday visits we were one of two tables.   I think if they want to increase the plate count they should lower the prices and or up the portion size."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. The drinks were way netter than we expected. I have nothing negative to say about this place! They know how to personalize the experience!"}
{"text":"Good food but a bit over priced. Service was ok but definitely was not 5 stars. We have the canoe appetizer tray. Wasn't too impressed.  I has the blackened ahi main course which was pretty good. Not sure if it was worth $30. The house Chardonnay was really good and the highlight of the night."}
{"text":"I do eat all food but their vegan options were not that great and they weren't creative. I was not impressed with the food here. Although they might have other good food but their vegan options not good. I definitely could've made more creative dishes than what they had. I'm sure their regular menu is delicious but shouldn't their whole menu be delicious. It was my girlfriends birthday and her dish was salty and she didn't eat it. I will say though that their drinks are amazing.. Their Drunken Mule is amazing and their Martini was really good."}
{"text":"My wife and I were EXTREMELY disappointed with our first experience with Roy's in Las Vegas. We went there for a special occasion and it was so not worth the price we paid for it.  First, we ordered the spare ribs for our appetizer. They came out and were tender, but hot on the outside, ice cold on the inside. We sent them back. The manager brought out of fresh order promising to check in on us, but alas never did.  For our entrees, I ordered the yellowtail with risotto. My risotto was crunchy. It wasn't palatable at all, but the fish was good. My wife ordered the boursin-stuffed chicken breast. The skin on the chicken was chewy, not crispy. The flavor of the chicken was lackluster at best. The potato pave side dish was crunchy but not in a good way.  This would have been OK if the service was good. But it wasn't. Our server barely checked in on us. My wife's drink sat empty until we finally put it on the outside of the table.   We saw other tables that looked like they were having better meals, however our server that night was uninformative and never came to check on us. The only saving grace was that the chocolate souffle was amazing!  We may give this location a second chance, but it will be a while, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Our second visit here with friends. We had an exceptional experience! The waiter was attentive, but not overbearing! The food was excellent, a pretty great dinning experience! Kind of torn between a 4 and 5 star rating! Their seafood dishes are the best you could find anywhere! Again, it's pricey, but worth the indulgence once in awhile!"}
{"text":"E KOMO MAI . . .WELCOME ....... Roy's puts you in a great state of mind when you walk in the door.  Roy's  has an excellent lounge serving supurb \"island\" drinks. The \"1988\" - a combination of grapefruit, Vodka and assorted liqueurs is not to be missed ....  Roy's is just an excellent experience for dinner. I take relatives and out of town friends there. My son had his 21st. birthday dinner at Roy's.  I have always enjoyed excellent service ...... Supurb friendly and knowledgeable people. It is hard to imagine that it is a chain restaurant....  I enjoy everything - the Braised Short Ribs are my # 1 favorite. They have an excellent Prix Fixe menu that changes slightly throughout the year. 3 courses @ $35.00 - hard to beat that deal for the quality of the food.  The meal is usually completed by the molton chocolate souffle. Everyone enjoys the hot liquid chocolate escaping from the cake when you cut into it.   Chef Roy Yamaguchi inspires the Hawaiian Fusion cusine served in the many Roy's locations. The three \"Hawaiian style mixed plates\" along with the seafood choices make dinner selection most difficult.  The quality of the food and the astounding menu choices will make you want to come again. Just to give your second choice for the night a try ....... You will do that over and over again ........  Roy's           -   you could not make a better choice ........."}
{"text":"Food was great.  They blew my order tho.  I ordered 14 oz ribeye with the demiglaze from the filet.  Waiter said they could do it. When my plate comes it's the filet. Rather than wait and have the whole table eat and I eat last I just ate it.  I also ordered crab fried rice that didn't come to the table until I reminded the manager that we'd ordered it.  All that said the food was really tasty.  Not a bad way to spend an anniversary.  Just wish I'd gotten to eat the ribeye."}
{"text":"Not the best Roys I have been to but still a good place to stop in for dinner escpecailly if you are looking for something off the strip. Standard dishes and \"Hawaiian Classics\" fill the menu and the decor isnt the best. Overall good but not a great branch of the Roys Empire.  Roys Baltimore is still number one in my book out of the 6 I have been to."}
{"text":"We've eaten at multiple roy's locations throughout the U.S. And although the Maui location stands out, this one is still one of the better locations.  My significant other loves this place and always gets the butterfish, I've tried a variety of dishes with fixed reviews, the salmon is one of the best I think.  I have to admit that when we come here and it's slow, your Roy's experience is much better than say on valentine's day or close to it. Still this place is pricey, most of time it's worth the cost but on some occasions not so much."}
{"text":"So yummy! They serve you edamame instead of bread. It's so flavorful. It's spicy and sweet - addicting!   I then got a mango martini sans the mint. Oh my goodness also too addicting! So great and bubbly.  I tried their specialty drink that was infused in pineapple for 2 weeks. It was pretty good. If you like coconut you'll like this.   We got the sampler plate. It was OK.  It had sushi, spring rolls, ribs and other food.   I had the Mahi Mahi for dinner. It was great.  Not fishy tasting at all. One negative to the dish was the side dishes. It came with asparagus and sliced potatoes.  The potatoes were so disappointing because they were flavorless and tasted a bit too hard. Besides that the dish was very good with extremely flavorful sauce.   We had pineapple upside down cake and the lava cake for dessert. The pineapple upside down was nothing worth writing home about. It didn't have very much flavor to it.  I've made a box mix pineapple cake that tasted better. It didn't even have that classic sugar crispness that you normally get from the brown sugar.  The lava cake was scrumptious. I do have to say the one negative about it was the raspberry sauce. It didn't taste good. The chocolate cake was still very good and very sweet.    This place is definitely a special occasions kind of place as it is quite pricey."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  The service was a bummer. We had calamari for our appetizer. It was good, however it took maybe 10 minutes before we got plates from our server, who just dropped it off and didn't seem apologetic at all. Then we had a basic salad. It was okay, presentation was poor. It came with mixed greens, then UNDER the greens were some chopped up veggies. Our entrees were excellent. I had the curry swordfish and my husband had the shrimp risotto. The server walked by several times while both my husband and I had empty cocktails. Never did he ask if we wanted another. However the help was great and kept our water glasses full :)"}
{"text":"Roy's has always been a family favorite (we've been to the Hawaii, La Jolla and SF locations) and this one did not disappoint. We were a bit worried its location inside a hotel might mean it was a scaled down version, but they still had everything we could ever possibly want to order.  Misoyaki butterfish will forever be my favorite dish. It's super savory but not too heavy, so you'll have plenty of room for appetizers and desert! The Aloha roll is another favorite!  The waitstaff is friendly enough and attentive when I told them I had food allergies (they're friendlier if you're there for dinner versus just happy hour appetizers). Happy hour outside is really nice when they have live music around the fire pit (you can hear some resort/pool noise in the background, but overall the ambiance makes you feel like you could be in Hawaii)."}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary and it was swell-ish. Compared to the other Roy's we've gone to in North Scottsdale, California and Hawaii, this location wasn't a standout but the quality and service was still great.   I always get the Aloha roll sushi appetizer and they were out of spicy tuna so they ended up subbing it for salmon inside which I loved even more than the original :)  I always get the Misoyaki Butterfish and thought my portion was a bit teensier than usual...but maybe the other Roy's just serve bigger portions.   We will be back (pro-tip: the Costco in Chandler sells $100 Roy's gift cards for $70, so pick some up to get $30 off)!"}
{"text":"Amazing ! I don't know how else to describe it. Food was awesome, service was quick, Rick took care of us the whole time and he was second to none. My mom took me for my 19th birthday a week ago and they went above and beyond to make me special for me, they even had a happy birthday card on the table. I recommend it, food is incredible, service is amazing, and the place is super nice! Thank you so much Rick!"}
{"text":"They ROYALLY messed up our order here. We actually were seated in the bar and expected to have to wait a bit for food, but I think the waiter forgot to put our order in. Everyone around us was served before we were. When we finally asked you could see the lightbulb go off and up comes the manager. \"There was a mix up in the kitchen and your food will be right up, please order a desert on us\". The reason I am giving this review 3 stars is simply because the food (eventhough it was probably prepared in a hurry with a cursing manager wagging her finger at the chef) was absolutely perfect. The butterfish is so great and the pineapple upside down cake was a pleasant but not over sweet dessert."}
{"text":"With all the amazing restaurants  in Las Vegas I often overlook Roy's. But I returned tonight and I now remember why I love this place so much.  Roy's is amazing, the service, the food quality and the beautiful presentation. The fish is fresh and cooked to perfection.   My recommendation is the butter fish (which is really black cod).  Its fresh, firm and melts in your mouth.  The salt and pepper calamari is light and flavorful and not over breaded. The sushi rolls are well made, a satisfying size and flavorful.   The presentation is picturesque and visually appealing.  The service is top notch.  Efficient, friendly and unobtrusive.  My water glass was never empty, my plates were cleared promptly and my every need was met.  Their Birthday service was an unexpected and exceptionally pleasing surprise.  Each menu featured a special page with my name on it.  The staff later presented me with a copy to take home.  They brought out a special birthday dessert with my  name and Happy Birthday written on the plate in delicious chocolate. They then took a picture of me and my guest, printed it, framed it and gave it to me! Hands down the BEST birthday dinner and birthday treatment I have ever experienced!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to this wonderful dining establishment .  Do yourself a favor and make your reservations today!"}
{"text":"The food was good but I think the service was what made it a really good experience for us. Our server Daniel was really attentive and thoughtful. He really went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience. I liked the lobster potstickers and the butterfish I had was good too!"}
{"text":"Ambience decor service all 4 star. Drinks are good and strong. Food  was very good would go again. Pricey but I knew that go in."}
{"text":"When visiting Scottsdale recently, our family wanted something other than spicy Mexican food & decided on Roy's. It was a decent choice, however not spectacular. The JW Marriott setting was beautiful (we stayed at this hotel last month), but hard not to compare it with the Roy's we know & love in Hawaii. We also didn't consider the parking situation. It was disappointing- the choice of far away parking in the giant hotel lot (minimum 10 minute walk or longer in high heels) or paying an exorbitant valet fee.  Most of us had their famous & delectable butterfish and spare ribs. The fish was divine - the spare ribs not so much, we compared it to our mother's pot roast (not a mouth-watering memory). The lobster dumplings were good, the tuna poke had an unexpected majority of avocado & other veggies in it. We also shared a tasty carmelized pineapple upside down cake and the chocolate bomb with remarkable coconut ice cream :-) The staff was professional & courteous. All in all, a nice meal, but rather expensive. I think we'll try a different restaurant on our next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"So I went there last night & It was super good! The apps were amazing. I think we had some sampler. The calamari and the potstickers were great! I forgot what else I ate..too much food! Anyways, so I ended up having the \"Maui Wowie Salad\" ( pretty funny name in my opinion! ) But it was really fresh and really tasty! I had the rib-eye for my main course. I'm not really a big steak fan, but this was amazing! And finally, the chocolate soufflé was a great way to end the night! Cheers to the chef, Brandon Konishi!(:"}
{"text":"Roys contacted us after our experience and was truly concerned about what had transpired.  It shows their attention to their customers and that each experience matters. We will try their business again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to eat here for my birthday and it was our very first time. I loved the food it was amazing and also the service. Since it was my birthday they decorating the table with flowers and a sign that said happy birthday. Then when we got our food the waiter took our picture and came back with a printed copy and put it in a framing. It was so nice! I also got cake at the end. It was the best experience ever. I loved it so much."}
{"text":"We took a stay cation.  Roy's was the place we finally ended up after trying out 2 other bars at the resort and getting no service.  The food selection, drink selection and prices were excellent.  The server was great but his Polo cologne was a little over powering.  Everyone knows polo when they smell it.  Sushi was fresh and cocktails were yummy"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant!  They even created a special \"Happy Anniversary\" flyer custom-made with our names and they inserted it into the dinner menu. Before we left, they removed both flyers and wrapped it up for us to take home as souvenirs. What a nice, personal touch. Food was fantastic (of course) and service very good too. Chocolate souffle was so rich and creamy. Oh, and they also gave us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary too, with chocolate words that said \"Happy Anniversary\" with our names on the plate of dessert. Beautiful touch!"}
{"text":"My DH & I  went for our anniversary last night, 03/27/10. The staff were friendly when we arrived and told us \"Happy Anniversary\", we received a card, as well. We went with their winter 3 course menu for $35. I got the lettuce wraps, tiger shrimp, and chocolate souffle. My husband got the rock shrimp tempura, salmon, and guava tart. Both of our appetizers were ok, nothing special. The entrees were about the same, nothing special, the shrimp were overcooked, and the salmon had too much sauce on it, you couldn't taste the salmon, the ingredients were good, but the way they prepared both entrees, were not very good. The highlight of the evening were the desserts, they were both good!   We've been to Roy's before, and we enjoyed our experience, so this was a complete disappointment.  Last year we went to Noca, and the food and experience was much better."}
{"text":"Times are getting better, much better. But we're still not back to where we were in 05' 06', so when my wife's birthday rolled around we thought it would be a good time to use the Roy's gift card we'd received as a gift from a family member. My wife, daughter (16), son (19) and I slipped into our goin' to town duds and we were off.  Considering the generous amount on the gift card, we thought we were in for treat. We used to be Roy's regulars at the Scottsdale location, but that was quite some time ago, and we were in for some surprises.  My wife had been thinking of sushi all week, but except for one quasi-roll, Roy's no longer serves it, so that's what my wife settled for. My Daughter ordered the short rib, and my son and I splurged, or so we thought, on the surf and turf which was billed as a petit filet and half a poached lobster. I understand petit, and I didn't expect an Aussie tail and an 8 ounce filet but what we got was shocking. If our filet's were 4 oz's I'll eat my hat, (which is about 8 oz). 3 bites and it was gone, the lobster would have been a decent sized prawn, 3 slivers of asparagus, a tablespoon of potatoes. I kept expecting Ashton Kutcher to pop up and tell me we were being punked. Again I didn't expect a Texas steak so big that \"If you eat it it's free\" but this was beyond the pail. I've eaten all over the world, I'm somewhat experienced.  I moved what little there was around my plate and then pretended that I was full from the calamari appetizer. I gave my son half of my steak, (1.5 bites) and all of my lobster tail. It was just appalling. My daughters meal was wonderful and my wife enjoyed the roll, we both had a glass of wine and we still had to cough up $140. on top of the $100 Gift Card. I left the place feeling like Clark Griswold after those Arizona Mechanics emptied his wallet for those 4 bald tires. Totally screwed. It was my Wife's birthday so I kept a smile on my face as we strolled around the beautiful Marriott grounds after dinner, then drove us home and made myself a sandwich."}
{"text":"Incredible customer service. We made reservations on their website and put added the note that we were celebrating my birthday.   When we got there, we were greeted and immediately told happy birthday. They took us to a nice booth and put a ribbon around our candle holder that I assume meant there was a birthday at the table.  Every server greeted me with a happy birthday.  The dining room attendant was very watchful. Whenever our drinks were low, he was right there to refill. Whenever would plates were empty, he would take them. Very attentive and nice.  For an appetizer we got the chef special calamari. The batter on the outside was great. Light, well seasoned, and not greasy. The round pieces were very small, but the miniature squid were great. And the miso dipping sauce was fantastic. Not the best calamari I've ever eaten but definitely great calamari.  I ordered the chef special swordfish and my husband ordered the butterfish. We also got a side of truffle bacon Mac and cheese. My swordfish was great. It was cooked medium. So, pretty well done but not too tough. The mushroom sauce that comes with it is a great pairing. The polenta cake is also very delicious.  The butterfish was amazing. Seriously, the waitress said it would melt on you mouth like butter because it's marinated for 24 hours or more. It did just that. A great mild fish with great seasonings and sauce.  But, the winner was dessert. Our waitress told us when our entree came out about their two desserts that people like to order early because they bake them right them and take about 20 minutes. First option was a pineapple upside down cake with in-house  made coconut ice cream. The other option was the chocolate molten soufflé with vanilla ice cream that everyone talks about. We were celebrating my birthday, so we ordered both.  But even before we got our dessert, they brought us this beautiful plate with scrolled chocolate \"Happy Birthday Bailey!\" With two tarts and berries and a lit candle. So sweet and beautiful.  My husband liked the pineapple upside down cake more, but he doesn't like things that are too chocolate-y. The cake was fluffy and soft. But, the coconut ice cream took the cake (pun intended) for me on that dish. Soooo good.  The chocolate molten soufflé was INCREDIBLE. I am truly a believer that there is never enough chocolate. This is a chocolate lovers dream. You cut into the cake and a hot dark chocolate flows out. The inside sauce is a beautiful bitter dark chocolate. Match that with the raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream... To die for!  I really would come back just for the soufflé.  For Vegas, I thought this place was very well priced. I didn't see anything on the menu over 40 dollars. We got out of there with an appetizer, two of the higher priced entrees, two desserts, and a side for 120 bucks (before tip, which we were generous on because they were so great to us!)  We would recommend this to anyone looking to get away from the strip for an hour or two. Seriously worth it."}
{"text":"More like a 4.5   I was going to give it 5 stars but then went in the bathroom.  The stalls are really small and if I were a little bigger then I wouldn't fit.  And it had been some time since they were checked because there was paper trash throughout the floor.  We went for date night before going to the movies because it is one of the places that offers a deal for restaurant week.  Instead of bread, they give edamame seasoned with sea salt, brown sugar, and togarashi (?) oh my are they addicting! The lobster potstickers were good even though there were only 3 of them, the sizzling beef app was tasty, but not worth $14.  The macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi, YUM!  I would even pay the asking price for that!.  Even the blueberry  cheesecake was light and fluffy.  Eric was our server and he was great!  Everything in a timely manner, the right personality, absolutely loved the team work they had there.  I think every should enjoy Roy's at least once!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Everytime we dine here, it feels like being back home in Hawaii.  The food is great, the servers are fantastic, and don't forget the happy hour special.   I highly recommend it to everyone who has never dine here.   See you soon Roy's...."}
{"text":"I recieved an apology from our server explaining that they did not understand it was our anniversary. I agree there was a lack of communication on our part. I thought they would automatically ask or assume after reading other yelpers reviews.  I think there is something good to be said for a restaurant that cares enough to respond to a negative yelp posting. I think you should go ahead and give Roy's a shot and make your own judgements.   Since I still think that ALL customers should be treated courteously regardless of the reason they come to visit a restaurant I can't go above 3 stars. The food is pretty good though!"}
{"text":"In all honesty, this place is decent.   Our waiter, John was wonderful. I came here to celebrate my birthday while in Vegas and they treated me like the Queen that I am. It was a quiet Tuesday night at 7:50pm and they promptly seated my father and I even though our reservation wasn't until 8:15pm. My father quickly explained to John that it was my birthday and John told me Happy Birthday atleast 3x throughout the night. I throughly enjoyed the Roy's Trio which was my entree. I got my seafood at the Chef's recommendations and it was excellent. As an appetizer,I got the lobster pot stickers and it was a wonderful Asian inspired dish. I appreciated the fact that this restaurant is stand-alone and that there was ample parking space. In Vegas I feel like everything is Valet this or valet that. So it was good to differ from the norm. I enjoyed the whole experience. I even enjoyed the fact that if you're celebrating a special occasion that offer a free picture printed right away.  Overall, I enjoyed myself and I would come back.   It is good to note that on Mondays they have an excellent pre-fix special. Do it if you can!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food. Great place to celebrate a birthday or anniversary. Wish I could visit more often."}
{"text":"I've frequented a few Roy's around the country and have always enjoyed the butterfish entree and the pineapple upside down cake. I was extremely disappointed in my last visit to this location. They stopped serving the butterfish with the black rice and the overall presentation was horrid. What little sauce that was on the plate was splattered around in a very unappetizing manner.  The recipe changed of the sauce too. What used to be a very unique delicious entree was not very good. The cake had a nice presentation but it was dry and forgetful. Not sure if it is a recent corporate change or difference in quality between locations. Looking around at the plates in our party (19 in all), I saw a similar lack of quality.  For the price of the meal, this was unacceptable."}
{"text":"Complimentary bottomless edamame with the meal, which is very nice.  Macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi was good, not especially impressive, but good.  Lobster potstickers and spicy ahi roll were good.    The star of the night was the chocolate souffle.  A must have!  The gooey, hot center was perfect."}
{"text":"Happy Hour! The limited menu at the bar of discounted drinks and apps make for a worthy HH.  The drinks are always solid.  The food is pretty good and fair amount of variety.  Definitely good enough to be the preferred HH location over Flemings."}
{"text":"We were told that this was a very nice restaurant with great seafood however we had a server with an attitude and entrée was just passable. We were not told any of the specials or even our servers name. Sorry I don't think will be back."}
{"text":"I have had good food at Roy's before, but the quality reminded me a bit of a snooty Applebee's this time.  The pot stickers had been under the heat lamp way to long.  The Ono was promised at medium and served at well.  Service was ok.  JW Marriott deserves a better on property kitchen!  11/21/13"}
{"text":"I took my family to dinner here last night and had a good night. They actually had a kids meal, which surprised me because I don't believe the one in Scottsdale had one. My son ordered the same meal that I did but a miniature version(short rib). It's about $13 for a kid's meal. They get to take their cup home which is a small pineapple cup. There was a bit of a wait for our food so the server's brought each of my kids a quesadilla plate which was nice. I wish that my short rib was just a little more tender. But my husband's filet was great! My daughter had chicken strips were okay. The server was very nice, but the bus boy seemed to be irritated that night.  Otherwise, it was a nice night with good food."}
{"text":"I visited here on the first and last days of a recent trip to Las Vegas.  The first trip was impressive enough (I would have given it 5 stars alone) that I was willing to pass up the myriad other excellent Vegas options for a return visit.  Both visits I was accompanied by Matt T. who posted a review on 1/19.  The first trip featured superb service by a waiter named Jeff.  He made excellent suggestions on Pinot Noir, and on a customized surf-and-turf combination to help me get over my indecision on that pressing question, \"steak or seafood?\"  The combination Macadamia-crusted Mahi Mahi paired with the Honey Mustard Garlic-Charred Beef Short Ribs was fantastic.  The ribs melted in my mouth and the sauce was flavorful but not overstated, so as to make it possible to sit alongside the more elegant seafood selection.  I highly recommend both.  I should also mention that the food was delivered in a very timely fasion. On the second visit, I took the opportunity to order a custom sushi roll (a \"Cherry Blossom\" for the initiated among you) and thus verified that these folks also impress on that delicacy. Also on the second visit, our original server Jeff transmuted into our bartender while we awaited seating.  Once again he excelled, keeping us occupied with masterful martinis, beer talk and polished social skill. Unfortunately, other things that happened that evening are what keeps me from going 5 stars on this place (I'd do 4.5 if that was possible!).  We arrived about 20 minutes early for our reservation, and as they were moderately busy they were not ready to seat us early.  However, we passed 45 minutes at the bar before I finally returned to the host station to find that they had simply forgotten us.  At this point we were seated immediately. That would have been OK, except that the next major faux pas was that after placing our orders, it took an HOUR for our entrees to arrive.  Our appetizers were also slow, with my friend Matt observing that the plates were warmer than the food.  By this time in the evening the restaurant was not particularly busy, so it really was completely inexcusable.   Regardless of the mistakes, the entrees still excelled as did the desert.  My attitude about the whole situation was really upturned by very appropriate, tactful handling of the situation by the manager.  I have no qualms about recommending Roy's given the excellence of the food, the overall quality of the service, and that I got to see how well management behaves in those difficult situations which are bound to happen on occassion."}
{"text":"If you want great food, it is here. The service matches the food. Yes it will cost you a few bucks but it was an excellent dining experience. The three fish plate I had was some of the best tasting fish I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Superb service. A +++  Went for my boyfriend's birthday  Good mojitos!  Got the \"canoe' appetizer, which is for two or more people, and it was pretty good.  But ... not great... not worth $26 to me  For an entree I got the the original combo or whatever It came with small portions of ahi, salmon, and butterfish  They were all very good, but not $26 good.   I guess I just wasn't too impressed with the food for the money spent... I dunno  I'd rather spend $200 at Sea Saw or Eddie V's"}
{"text":"Outside of the excellent food, the customer service stands out. Waiters really knew their menu & was always giving great dining suggestions & prep suggestions too.  The pork belly dim sum was really good. Something different & not too heavy.   I had the fish trio and all three fish were cooked perfectly, what stood out from the three fish though was the \"Butter Fish\" so much that I ordered an entree of it! Delicate & it lives up to the name! Melted in my mouth like butter! Only complaint was some of the fish had some bones, but that's expected! lol   Definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow Freakin' Wow.  I have never, ever had such a perfect dining experience from the minute they greet you, learn your name, cater to your every need, and give you FABULOUS, beautifully prepared food since...well, NEVER.   I must say I did do my research, so I did know what I wanted to try and even though I kind of expected the JW Marriott to be more of a snooty place, I felt it would be closest to my house and wanted to find out for myself what all the hoopla was about this Roy person and his fish.  I went with my friend Amy who was visiting from New York. She had been to Roy's before and is a fellow foodie. We got to the restaurant early and went outside on the immense patio area to sit and have a drink. It's December so a bit chilly but the HUGE, soft patio furniture was extremely cozy and we sat and had $20 martinis (LOADED with vodka. Warning: We had to ask for more fruit juice! And we are major drinkers - just gotta throw that in there.) Our waitress on the patio could not have been more accomodating and she even brought us new martinis even though we drank quite a bit of our strong ones. I am a people watcher and it was nice to see that there was an assortment of people sitting on the furniture, some of them looked like they could be relatives of mine, enjoying the late afternoon, reading, conversing....well, if I HAD any rich or classy relatives, that is. It was very nice and relaxing. Plus the Mariott property is stunning and I wish I could have looked around the property more than we did.  When we meandered inside for dinner, the hostess greeted us by name and our server showed us to our table. She was very competent, could make recommendations, and was pleasant without being clingy. We loved her. She reminded me of Joan Cusack. Sounded just like her!  The complimentary appetizer of lightly spiced, steamed edamame was delightful and even though they gave us warmed wet washcloths we were complete heathens and ate with our hands without ever using them.  We shared the Roy's Canoe for Two, which had Lobster potstickers, Beef Satay, shrimp on a stick (not its real name), and Tuna Sushi Rolls. I must say - the Lobster potstickers - better than sex. The Beef satay was basically this ultra-tender beef on a stick, lightly flavored and grilled. Fabulous. But the pinnacle of perfection here was the Tuna sushi rolls, which absolutely knocked our socks off. I have never, ever had such an amazing piece of sushi before that moment. I think our  server, Joan Cusack (Not her real name) thought I was choking because as I ate it, my eyes were rolling back into my head in ecstacy.  She bustled over and once she got closer she could see she was merely interrupting a very intimate moment with me and my tuna roll and she went back to her post after giving me a thumbs-up sign. For whatever reason, these tuna sushi rolls were encrusted in what may have been macadamia nuts and it was completely divine. I re-live that moment over and over. MMM.  But you know, the showstopper was STILL yet to come. I could not believe my luck when my Roy's Trio was placed in front of me. It was a piece of Hawaiian butterfish in Miso sauce, a piece of Seared Ahi, and a piece of salmon. The poor salmon! It was the best salmon I ever had out, but next to those two it was like Cinderella's ugly stepsister. Just upstaged by the butterfish, which is melt-in-your mouth decadence, and the seared ahi - which surpassed the tuna roll I just got done fantasizing about as the most perfect piece of sushi EVER.  Amy got the butterfish. We licked our plates clean. Amy tried my Ahi and declared it, like I did, the BEST seared Ahi on the planet.  For dessert, you KNOW I had to have the molten chocolate souffle. How good was it?? Brad Pitt could have walked up naked to our table and I would not have looked up long enough to stop shoveling it into my face.  Amy ordered the 3 creme brulees - one had a Hawaiian orchid on it, and they were not only lovely but they tasted amazing. The coconut one was so fresh and it made me think that THIS is what every coconut cream pie in the world needs to taste like. I think the other flavors are vanilla bean (very good too) and maybe rum? (also very good)   It may not sound like I am doing the dessert justice but when you've been kissing George Clooney for an hour then along comes Rick Springfield, which one is better? They are both amazing, but by the time Rick comes along, well, you're kind of spoiled already.  Roy's could not have been better - this entire experience was an A++ through and through.   The staff was extremely helpful (someone walked me to the ladies room when I merely asked where it was) (Oh and need I mention the corwn molding in the bathroom stalls was nicer than the crown molding in my house???) (And you know you are in a classy joint when a basket of tampons and maxi-pads is out on the marble bathroom counter, like party favors for down under)  THUMBS WAY UP!!!"}
{"text":"Review #009 - 2016  I can't believe I never wrote a review for this location, considering how big of a Roy's addict I am and how often I visit Las Vegas so this review is long over due...  My family tries to visit Roy's every time we travel just to compare the food and service at each location.  Thankfully, we were not disappointed in the food quality nor the service level at this location compared to San Francisco.  We ordered our usuals--Joshua has always loved their lobster potstickers so he uses that as his guide.  If the lobster potstickers are good, then he will be more than happy to return to that location.  He was so happy with his potstickers that he decided to order a second one as his main entree.    Owen & I shared a wagyu beef steak potsticker as our appetizer, and both ordered the misoyaki butterfish as our entrees and it was just as tasty as we've always remembered.  For dessert, I decided on the macadamia tart, my all time favorite at Roy's and it was delicious.  We also had a complimentary chocolate soufflé which is always good and Owen had a complimentary Hawaiian martini, which he enjoyed as well.  Unfortunately, being that Las Vegas has so many restaurants, it makes it hard to return to Roy's on every trip.    I can never say enough good things about Roy's & am always looking forward to the next opportunity to make my visit to such a great establishment!  Sadly, I didn't take any pictures of our food since we ended up ordering our usuals which we have plenty of pictures of already, according to my son."}
{"text":"Can we say LOVE at first bite? Oh yes we can.  My parents and I recently visited Roy's while visiting Phoenix. I had been to the Roy's in Anaheim, CA and enjoyed it very much. However, this experience was worth writing about. My husband made the reservation for us and indicated that we were celebrating my graduation. Although we were late, we were seated promptly and had excellent service.  We were given edamame and it was just wonderful. I ate it all myself and really enjoyed it, I would say it tops my edamame list for sure. Then I had the short ribs with mashed potatoes and they were heavenly. They basically melted in my mouth and the short ribs were just so tender and perfect. I did not want my meal to end. After we were done, the waiter (who was excellent) brought out a small dessert for me with congratulations written in chocolate (which made it even better) and it was excellent. The staff then offered to get a picture of us and returned promptly with a copy (which actually is a very good picture). Overall, I really enjoyed the experience at this Roy's location. From the food to the service to the ambiance, it was just fabulous.... even though there were a few crazy drunk people at the bar!"}
{"text":"Pre fix Mondays at Roy's are a must!!! Lobster wontons are amazing, macadamia nut mahi mahi is to die for! Any dessert  will do!"}
{"text":"Went to have my what is now a Traditional Birthday dinner and was greeted with friendly faces and kind words. Had a table reserved for me with a Birthday greeting card. My server Ben couldn't of been better and was very customer friendly.  One reason for my soon return is Ben because of his attention he gave to my needs. Was another Great Birthday experience. Thank You."}
{"text":"Roy's is a great place to dine when you want to try a mix of middle east, island, asian, and western cuisine; in other words, a fusion of flavors.  This restaurant was available back home on Guam, but I never had the time to stop by the hotel and try it.  Last night I was on a quest to find something different to eat, and Roy's fit the bill.  When we walked in, it was like stepping into a restaurant on the Big Island.  Comfortable, dim lighting made for a sophisticated yet comfortable eating atmosphere.  The staff uniforms are simply any island shirt and slacks, which is great because individual personalities stand out for each server.  The menu is just as nice as the atmosphere--short and to the point.  There are specialties that your server will point out to you as well as any suggestions for the evening.    I suggest their Lakalinau roll--wagyu beef on top of the roll that has termpura asparagus, snow crab, sesame miso and truffled greens.  That blew my mind.  The textures are fabulous and the flavors were amazing together.  All I could say while eating it was \"Oh my God\".  I'm hardly ever into a roll that much, so this surprised me.    We had sashimi and their rock shrimp tempura which, by the way, was sprinkled with saffron and served with a great peanut sauce.  That was the first time I've ever eaten Indian tempura, so to speak, and it was wonderful.    Their butterfish is so flaky and full flavored that I wanted to eat all of it, but it was my husband's order.  It has this thai chili sauce on the plate that was mildly sweet and spicy.  Great choice.  I had the macadamia crusted mahi, which was very good, too.  Although more firm than the butterfish and not as flavorful, it was still great.  The asparagus was good on the plate.  Their complimentary edamame has this crazy garlic and spice flavoring that it's tossed in, which I loved.  It reminds me of the same garlic sprinkles that are on top of Beijing Noodle's (at Caesars Palace) crispy chicken.  I love that stuff.  Overall, a great experience and definitely a restaurant I'll frequent more often.  You must try their sushi if you aren't in the mood to spend too much on dinner, and if you are willing to splurge, grab the butterfish, the roll I mentioned, and ask for extra edamame.   If I could give 3.5 stars I would, but I can't say that I'm a fan because the sushi was the only thing that flipped my mind.  The flavors are great here, and the food is good, but their specialty is fish and compared to RM Seafood, this place is just fair."}
{"text":"We are staying at the hotel and decided to take advantage of the happy hour. Since it's tax day, it's HH all night. The folks here are really nice, accommodating and the food is fab. I think the manager himself is Roy of Roys because he is so friendly. 5 star service for sure."}
{"text":"Larry the Bartender is amazing, and makes excellent drinks.  The food was good, but I'll be back to that location just for drinks!!"}
{"text":"Service is always excellent, and so is the food.  I always have the Ahi and a Hawaiian martini."}
{"text":"I have a friend that worked here who hooked us up with all kinds of different food.  Everything was pretty good.  Only thing I didn't like was the Schezuan (sp) ribs I believe it was.  Ick.  The molten lava chocolate cake was orgasmic though!"}
{"text":"With all of the raving and great things said about Roy's we (5 of us) couldn't wait to come here.  Two of my group had been here before and had nothing but great things to say.  So what went wrong last Tuesday night?  First the good stuff:  We decided to order drinks, yak for awhile then order.  We told that to the waiter who couldn't quite seem to get it but finally did.  I ordered  a Watermelon and Jalapeno Margarita.  Premium liqour, sliced jalapeno's and one of the best drinks I've ever had.  Went well with the great bowls of edamame they serve as you settle in your seat.     My friends' salmon, butterfish and shrimp dishes were deemed excellent and they were!   Lilokai salad was very different with toasted macadamia nuts.  We liked it very much.   I ordered the halibut in dashi broth with scallion spaezle.  I love spaezle and this one sounded different.   Then I  realized I could substitute so I changed my order  by ordering the pancetta wrapped Hebi but subbed a side of spaezle instead of the squash.   The waiter said \"no problem at all.\"  Well there must have been a problem.....  Here's the bad stuff:   The edamame that we still had half of one bowl left was whisked away along with our dishes while we were still munching on the stuff.  When we told our waiter he apologized and said he'd bring another.  He didn't.  We asked again,  He still didn't.  We TOLD him again and he finally did.     I had no knife and no napkin.  When I asked for napkin I had to repeat my request to the busboy cuz our waiter never brought it.  I never got the knife I asked for 3 times.    The waiter brought our dinners.   I got the halibut.  Realized I got the wrong dinner and by the time I was brought the Hebi I ordered most of my tablemates had finished eating.   The Hebi was tough, I needed a knife to cut it.  Never have cut fish with a knife before but had to borrow a knife from my friends sitting next to me cuz my knife never arrived.    The fish was bland as well as tough so it was a double whammy for me.    J. said her butterfish was outstanding, C. loved her salmon as did M., and they insisted I try it.  They were right, it was awesome. L. said the shrimp was to die for.   I got screwed.   LOL.  I just ordered the wrong thing is all, but the service was bad, just plain bad.   There were two other tables occupied when we got there so there was no excuse.   When we left the place was packed full and for a Tuesday that was impressive.   I would love to give this place another try and maybe I will but the service had better improve.   For the $73.00 that dinner cost me I expected more.   Ambience:  Beautiful and romantic."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go for pick up since Roy's wasn't an in-room dining option at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge.     Called in order from hotel room. Order was ready in ~15mins.  And was able to charge to hotel room.    Rolls tasted ok - didn't wow, but did hit the spot.  Sushi rice tasted flat texture wise and perhaps wasn't seasoned?  Sauces (citrusy ponzu and green onion oil) that came with spicy tuna roll (aloha roll) were tasty and elevated the flavor of the both rolls."}
{"text":"Having grown up eating Hawaiian food, parents are from Maui, I would like to think that I have a certain \"tongue\" for the flavors of the islands.  I've never been able to make it to the Downtown LA branch.   This past weekend's Vegas trip for my cousins birthday allowed us to finally try it out.  I tend to not like \"fusion\" restaurants as they tend to butcher the cuisine away from the traditional and towards the mainstream taste.  I can honestly say that Roy's does no such butchering.  Service:  If I could give a 10 star just for service I would.  On the way to the restroom, I stopped by the front desk and informed them that it was my cousins birthday.  I had found out later that a Happy Birthday message was given to my cousin as I was in the restroom.  Our drinks were never empty over the entire meal, sometimes even being replaced when half empty.  Our waiter was awesome and was very truthful about his recommendations.  As we walked out the front door after dining, the valet had my car already sitting there.  Top notch service!  Appetizers:  For appetizers we had - Tiger Prawns w/ Pad Thai, Rock Shrimp & Peaches, Ahi Tuna Poke and the Heirloom Tomato & Crispy Mozzarella Salad.  All were great, I'd have to say the tomato and mozzarella salad was the best of the 4 with the Poke in a close second.  Main Dish:  I had the Misoyaki Butterfish.  This was excellent as well.  Flavors were bold and the fish was exceptionally prepared.    Dessert:  Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle.  This was by far the star of the meal.  Do not look at anything else for dessert, just order it!  I cannot put into words how good this was.  I loved the whole evening at this Roy's and cannot wait to try the Downtown LA branch.  Hopefully it will be sooner rather than later....."}
{"text":"We went to Roy's last night for my husband's birthday and it was PERFECT start to finish!! They were so attentive and made a special occasion even more special. We had the Auntie Lei roll, makiwaiki salad, butterfish (black cod) which was incredible!! The chocolate soufflé - unreal!   Look forward to next time."}
{"text":"A few coworkers & I were in Phoenix over Valentine's Day, and we paid a visit to Roys that night.   I will preface this review by letting you know that my individual bill at Roys was over 90$ and I didn't even order a cocktail.   The restaurant is fancy, upscale, expensive, romantic, etc. The type of place people might visit on a *special occasion.*  I fully understand the type of offerings this restaurant has and nowhere in print has this restaurant claimed to be veg-friendly, however I was extremely disappointed at the response I got when I requested a vegetarian meal. I was offered pasta & artichoke.   (This may not sound cliche if you are not a vegetarian, however if you are you know that hotels and restaurants OFTEN offer pasta due to a lack of knowledge and/or creativity)   Do you meat eaters and chefs think that's all we eat? Bunny food?  While my co-workers thought that food was decent, delicious, I was borderline miserable.   With a claim like this....  \"Chef Roy has created many signature dishes that have become international favorites through the years. Many of these are featured on our menus throughout the country in addition to the uniquely designed offerings created by our local Chef partners, each of whom has been trained under the tutelage of Roy Yamaguchi himself.\"  .....you'd think this guy could come up with something more than just pasta for someone who doesn't want to eat seafood....."}
{"text":"The service here was exceptional, and the food was great.  To start you get seasoned edemame instead of bread.  The seafood is fresh and the sauces and seasonings are perfect.  Our food took a little  bit longer than it should have, but the manager came over to personally apologize and to see if he could get us anything while we waited.  The portions are perfect- not too big and not too small- and the desserts are delicious.  I hope to go back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow,  the service here is second to none! Truly outstanding.  I didn't care for my dinner but that was due to my ignorance of what I ordered. My wife lived hers.  They went above and beyond to make up for my mistake."}
{"text":"Rating is based on the items that I've had at Roy's!  Sushi is wonderful!  Kobe Roll & Garden Island Rolls are always amazing!!! MMM!  The Braised Short Rib is so moist and soft The Miso Butter Fish is also amazing!!!  For dessert go for either... Chocolate Souffle Macadamia Tart...  SO GOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"It was my sister's 50th birthday and we wanted to take her Roy's to celebrate.  At first we were a little apprehensive because it was near the strip.  When we arrived the surroundings were not the best.  The hostess opened the door and greeted us which was unexpected.  The other hostess at the front greeted us and ask who was the birthday girl.  My sister embrassed by the number of years told the hostess it was my 11 year daughter who was having the 50th birthday, everyone laughed.  We were taken to our table and the hostess pulled each napkin for the ladies in our group and then the gentleman (sign of a good restaurant and professional staff).  She handed us our menus and to our suprise there was a message to my sister wishing her a Happy 50th Birthday, she was very happy to see this.  We ordered appetizers and our entrees.  The appetizers arrived and they even brought a kid's appetizer for my daughter which made her very happy.  Jennifer our waitress and her staff were very attentive.  I was curious about the lettuce that accompanied our spring role appetizer and asked the wait staff what was the purpose of the lettuce.  He said that the chef recommends to wrap the roles with the lettuce and dip it into the sauce to get the full experience.  He also said if we did not want to wrap the roles it would be just as good. We wrapped the spring roles and dipped it in the sauce an it was excellent  As the night went on we were served our entrees. Hanger steak, Sushi, Buttterfis, Salmon and another dish for the birthday girl that I could not remember (senior moment).  The food was excellent.  When we were done eating, the waitress brought my sister a berry mouse/ice cream dessert with a candle and wrote Happy 50th Birtday in chocolate sauce. we also order the pineapple upside down cake with creamy vanilla ice cream which was fabulous.  Later, the Jennifer came to our table with a camera and took a picture of the whole group and we thought that was a very nice touch.  She also took our camera took another picture.    As the night came to an end the manager came over to wish my sister a Happy Birthday.  We told him we missed the W Charleston location and he said there was not enough business in that area to support the restaurant.  However, he did say that the corporation will be opening  \"Bonefish\" at a later date.  Yeah!!  After he left the hostess came by and gave my sister the picture of the whole group in a picture frame.  This was an extra nice touch that we appreciated. The ambience and food were great. We'll be back again and again.   Thank you Roy's of Las Vegas for a wonderfull evening!"}
{"text":"Roy's was the most enjoyable restaurant experience I've had as of recent. Everything from our bartenders recommendations of wines, to the personal attention from the General Manager, to the perfect service from our exceptional server, to the food, left absolutely nothing to be desired. The food itself is plenty reason to go back again and again, but the experience as a whole makes this one notch above the top."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Great attention to detail with the food. It was all delicious and since we were celebrating our anniversary they gave us a bit more attention which made us feel special.  The chefs, waiters and managers really know what they're doing here"}
{"text":"Dined here with family to celebrate a birthday. Wonderful service with personalized birthday greetings inserted into the menu. Food was tastefully done without being over-bearing. Enjoyed the various unique ingredients in each dish. First class service from Parking valet to Manager. You make the 808 proud..."}
{"text":"The service was worse than the food. And our food was not that good. The waitress took 20 minutes to get my wife a drink. I had to ask the manager to find out where The drink was. When our food came the mashed potatoes were cold my kids pasta was overcooked and gross. $13.95 for a kids meal?  They charged us $17.50 for soda water. The \"butterfish\" was decent, but the bottom of the fish was gray and smelled very fishy.  BTW, it was Cod they told me.  Overall I will never come back to this restaurant. It's a shame after all these years this place is going downhill. We went on a Tuesday night, thinking we should get a pretty decent service. Boy were we wrong. We were celebrating a graduation, and this was definitely not a way to end the night.  If you want to pay an absorbent amount of money and have terrible service this is definitely the place you should go."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try out Roy's for a while now, and finally got around to stopping in this past Friday...  We rolled in a little after 9ish, and business was quite slow at this time ... I believe there might have been a few people in the bar area and only another two top in the dining room area.  Needless to say we were seated fairly promptly and the hostess seemed pleasant.  A server greeted us promptly, and since neither of us had been here before and there was a rather extensive menu it took us a few minutes to ask the waiter questions and review our possible menu choices.  I opted to try a Hawaiin (pineapple) Martini, and my friend had a glass of wine.  I must admit the pineapple Martini was delicious and a very well balanced cocktail.   The server asked us if we would like some complimentary edamame, and I must say I believe they flavored the edamame with some sort of hawaiin spice/flavoring because they tasted quite delicious and different from the typical bland heavily salted edamame.... it was nice.  I decided to try the surf and turf option - filet mignon and lobster tail.  It was very reasonably priced at under $60, and it was very good.  I was actually impressed the lobster was soooo yummy.  My medium filet was nicely flavored hawaiin style and it was accompanied with bearnaise sauce, which is one of my favorite dipping sauces for filet, so I was quite pleased.  I will admit it's not the best lobster tail or piece of filet that I have ever had, so it was not absolutely exceptional, but it was great tasting based on the price and portion size - it hit the spot and the plate presentation was very nice too!! The broccolini was a nice light side.    My friend tried the half chicken dinner and seemed to like it ... However, I did not try it, so I really can't give any sort of extensive review about it.  Overall, I would probably rate Roy's a solid 4.5 star review if that was possible.  We really enjoyed our dinners/adult beverages, the service was very good, the overall ambiance and look of the restaurant was was appealing, and the reasonable price point/portions were spot on!  I would absolutely recommend Roy's to others, and I am sure I'll be back to have another filet/lobster tail dinner with a Hawaiin twist at some point in the future!"}
{"text":"Roy's defines all that is good about fine dining. In fine dining it is about more than just good food. It is the entire experience, which I have everytime I go there. The food is magnificent, the Lakinilau roll (I doubt I spelled that right) is to DIE FOR! The entrees are always magnificent, they have the best sushi chef in the valley. The desserts are amazing, try any of the special creme brulee's or their signature chocolate souflee. Besides the food, the staff always makes our night memorable and delicious! The service staff are on top of everything and the management always make every attempt to keep us happy. Many times I will just come in to sit at the bar for cocktails (yummy Hawaiian Martini) and appetizers! I love Roy's!"}
{"text":"Since I'm a fan of Roy's it was great to know that my group was having a business dinner here.  There were a total of 8 in my party. The food was great, drinks were flowing, and our server kept up with our chaos.  Plus, it's nice to know that after a few cocktails, you can just walk to your room since this Roy's is located on the Marriott Desert Ridge resort."}
{"text":"I love there sushi amazing. . Great service and food. Nice happy hour and great e mail specials for the regulars. Never disappoints fun place to go.  Great desserts too."}
{"text":"This Roy's did not disappoint. The waiters here were extra attentive all night long, bringing edamame almost immediately upon our arrival. I ordered from the  price- fixed three course menu, which at $36.95 is an excellent value for this quality food. I began with the spring rolls (3) that were tasty and crispy, although I found the lettuce wrap and peanut butter sauce that arrived with them to be unnecessary. Next, the grilled sirloin steak with jasmine rice melted in my mouth it was so flavorful and delicious. I finished this meal with Roy's classic chocolate soufflé and the chocolate was appropriately runny and rich. My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"First visit.  This is a tricky review to write.  But I'll try.  This place is a little loud.  Not sure why.  It wasn't even full.  But it was loud.  Nice ambiance other than the 'loud'.  An understated tropical feel. I could do without the TV's in the bar, or at least partition them better.  Made the place look like a sports bar (there was some sort of sporting event going on).  The fish tank is nicer but too small to see everywhere.  This was our anniversary.  I expected the place to be full so I made reservations ahead of time.  They asked if we were celebrating anything, and they do a few special little things for your event.  That was nice.  There were three menus.  They had a special three-course meal menu (which my wife ordered), a one-page special drink menu (I didn't really look closely at that one), and the main menu.  The main menu is probably about 1/2 drink menu (the first two pages at least).  The waitress was very professional and explained the different menus, and then made some recommendations.  I went with the grilled ono (a type of fish) because she said it was a house specialty.  I also got the poke appetizer because I like poke.  So the appetizers arrive.  My wife chose the calamari salad as part of her three-course menu option.  I tried it.  It was good.  Not extraordinary, but good.  I did think adding heat to it was a bit odd.  Calamari isn't a strong flavor and you're going to add jalapeño to it (or whatever chile it was)?  I know you want to set yourself apart, but that doesn't seem like an appropriate match to me.  I will be returning to this theme shortly.  The poke was good.  I thought a bit too much avocado with it, but I could taste the poke.  It came with chips which would have been good for scooping, but the chips overwhelmed the poke.  Maybe it was the combination of a lot of avocado with the chips that dulled the poke too much, but I just ate it with a fork instead. It would have been better to emphasize the tuna in the poke.   My wife's entree was the mahi mahi.  By itself it wasn't really very good, but there was a little puddle of dipping sauce (green).  If you used that it was much better.  That flavor combination seemed to work reasonably well.  The kimchee pancakes that came with it were OK.  Not great.  Dipping sauce didn't help.  My ono was fine, if a little sour.  Delicate flavor that they didn't seem to do much with that I could detect.  Just grilled it, maybe some lemon juice (I assume since it was a little sour).  It came with a cheesy risotto that was too strong for the fish, but did counteract the sour.  It was good risotto, but I couldn't taste the fish at all.  So, again, we have a flavor combination that didn't seem to work right.  Presentation was impeccable for all dishes. They clearly paid attention to that detail, which is nice.  Service was pretty good.  Just about the time you started to wonder if they were going to check on you, they checked on you.  A little slower than other places, but at the same time they're giving you privacy for your dinner companion.  The last course was a chocolate souffle, and it was great.  A lot like a lava cake (really hot chocolate sauce inside).  It was probably the best thing we had that night.  My wife also really liked her mango \"martini\" (actually it was a mango-rum drink).  So in summary, we had flavors that didn't seem to compliment each other well in at least two things we ate.  Presentation was expert, service was good, the little extras for our anniversary were nice.  But I can't say I'm a fan, especially at these prices.  For the price paid the food should have been a harmonious symphony of flavors, not a dischordant attempt to partner mismatched flavors.  If you're going to try to be high-end and charge high-end prices, your food has to be high-end too.  And it just wasn't.  I'm willing to concede it may have been a function of what we ordered.  The mahi mahi with green sauce worked, but it's weird that two of our items didn't quite hit the flavor harmony that they should have.  I'm going with three stars (barely) because of the mahi mahi, the chocolate souffle, and the poke (without the chips).  But I would only recommend it with the caveat that maybe if you order something different you might have better luck with the flavor symphony."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this place, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes which was helpful. This way my first time having Hawaiian fusion and I was pleased. I had the Roys Trio which includes the hibachi grilled salmon, roasted macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi and the misoyaki \"butterfish\" and was absolutely amazed by this dish, the butterfish literally melts in your mouth. I paired this dish with the Conundrum aromatic wine which made an excellent pairing. The decor was modern, the restaurant was dim lit which lends to the ambiance perfectly, the dishes are beautifully plated and customer service was excellent. We were even allowed to sit at our table until our cab arrived. I recommend."}
{"text":"Freaking amazing! A MUST try!  I had the Prosciutto Wrapped Hawaiian Ono, again... AMAZING! This place is awesome, can't say enough great things about it! The staff did an exceptional job. Their $5 happy hour menu is a pretty good size with pretty good portions, would recommend two if your creating a meal.  The prices are good for the happy hour selection but the full meal menu prices are  a lil steep ($25-$35, couple items up to $40) compared to surrounding restaurants but well worth it. I will definitely be visiting Roy's again as well as recommending it to others."}
{"text":"No wonder why this restaurant get's some of the best reviews! I ate here a couple nights ago and I must say that this has got to be one of the best restaurants in town! I originally booked my reservation on Opentable.com and everything went smooth! No complaints on that portion! Let's get down to business.. Service : WONDERFUL! Upon arrival my party was greeted promptly by a very friendly hostess and seated quickly (Always A Plus!) The ambiance of this place is nothing short of romantic and classy! I love the lighting around the building and the candle lit tables! We had an awesome waiter named Jerry! Very helpful as far as making suggestions on what to eat and also knowledgeable about the different menu items! I originally ordered a Mojito (Terrible) so I had them switch out for the Roy's Mai Tai (Too sweet) and finally settled with a regular Margarita (Excellent). For the appetizer we went the \"Sunrise At Haleakala\" Yamahuchi Sushi Roll! If you love fish, you will LOVE this! Entrees: Shellfish Sampler & Surf & Turf.. No complaints on either dish! Very well prepared and the presentation was lovely! Desert we ordered chocolate soufflé another great choice of dessert if you are a chocolate lover! 5-Stars across from me!!!"}
{"text":"My husband & I came here last April (2016) for our one year wedding anniversary.  We arrived & they had made a little sign, with our anniversary date on it.  Super cute.  The service was great, dinner was tasty & they treated us to dessert! They definitely made us feel special."}
{"text":"The butterfish is so soft and yummy!  The lobster bisque was delicious.  The calamari was just average. The sauce that came with it was interesting, but it definitely clashed with the calamari itself. I went to taste the sauce by itself and it was delicious, so the pairing was the issue.  The jumbo pawns were about average.  The potato pie dessert was not that great. I have a sugar tooth and it didn't hit the spot for me. It's not really a pie, but more of a cross between a scone and cake.  For the price.... i almost want to give this a 3.5 rating if it were available, but I still had a good time.   The staff was very friendly.  Scaling below 5 being the highest Food: 4 or 4.5 Food Presentation: 5 Friendly Service: 4.5 Ambiance: 4"}
{"text":"Sunday nights are not overwhelming. I doubt this place is ever empty, but at least it wasn't packed! Great service. Thanks, Bruce!   As good as the butterfish is, I loved the lobster!! Served in the shell, butter poached, the best I have ever had!!  Get the surf & turf, it is worth it! Filet was cooked perfectly!!  In general, I noticed how the servers were very knowledgeable with what temperatures the meat & fish should be cooked too, and the chefs prepared everything with excellence.   Lobster california roll was nothing special.   Hibachi salmon was good, macadamia nut mahi mahi was good.  Interesting spice on the edamame.  The portions are not huge, but they are reasonable and enough food. Pricing is appropriate for what you get as well.   Nice plus is that if you don't prefer what the meal comes with, you can sub the sides and there was not an additional charged as I had feared. (subbed rice & bok choy for truffle cream corn risotto-it wasn't for me, but it was prepared very well.)  Definitely a great place for celebrating.  $5 valet with validation. It's the JW Marriott, not Red Lobster, so we were happy to have someone bring us our car.  Service=5, Ambiance=5, Quality/Taste of Food= 5 Stars  I greatly look forward to going back!! I had my eye on those lobster potstickers!"}
{"text":"We went here a few years ago for a friend's birthday.  They were top notch. The service was superb. They put a note on every menu (as they did not know where the birthday girl was sitting) saying \" Happy Birthday\" and her name. It was so sweet. The food was delicious and it had a nice atmosphere. They came around with  cake and a scoop of ice cream that she let us all share with her. In chocolate  they wrote out  \"Happy Birthday\" with her name on the plate as well. It was a beautiful presentation.   We will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Technically, Roy's is outside the northern boundary of which I would drive for a meal, but since it was to be a free meal and I wouldn't be doing the driving, how could I say no?  It is a chain, but in Roy's defense, the majority of the menu items are created by the local chefs with only a portion of the menu available at all restaurants.  Roy's is billed as Hawaiian fusion, but my first thought was \"oh no, there's sushi on the menu, I won't like this place.\"  I am happy to say I was wrong.  Don't let my husband read this.  He thinks I'm never wrong.  My husband also always says I'm stuck in the 80's, so I ordered the 1988 cocktail (grapefruit and pomegranate with a grapefruit vodka and lychee liqueur).  Since I was the lone drinker, I stuck with one, but could have easily had 2 or 3 more of these, especially with a little Duran Duran background music.    We started with Roy's Canoe Appetizer for Two, adjusted for three.  It includes lobster potstickers and teppanyaki shrimp, both of which were really good.  Also on the boat were Thai beef satay and spicy tuna roll, neither of which I tried.  My husband vouched for the tuna roll, however.  Next up was the grilled endive, apple, and bleu cheese salad with pomegranate vinaigrette.  If you're a salad lover, you would probably love it.  If you're a salad hater, you would probably love it, too.  For my entree, the pancetta crusted Alaskan halibut with tomatoes and chevre, mushroom ravioli.  This, too, was fantastic, although there was a little too much oil on the plate, maybe from the pancetta??  But the fish was nicely prepared and the ravioli was excellent.  My husband insisted on the chocolate souffle which must be ordered at the start of your meal, but due to a glitch with our pregnant server needing a bathroom break, it didn't get put in early enough.  We waited and were given a starter dessert on the house, and both the server and the gal who forgot to put the order in both profusely apologized.  Hey, I would gladly welcome another screw up if a second dessert was involved.  The souffle was lick your plate good and the blueberry tart (I think that was the name of it) was incredibly good as well.  So good, I may have to break my driving rule and have dessert there again.  Probably 4.5 stars, but I'm feeling stingy today."}
{"text":"I was seriously disappointed with this place. I've always wanted to try this place out ever since I've heard good things about it when I was in culinary school. The food quality just doesn't justify the prices. For appetizers, I had the calamari and the boyfriend had the short ribs. The calamari came out soggy and rubbery. The short ribs were good but were very oily. For our entree, I had the fillet mignon while my boyfriend had the salmon. Again, very disappointed. The salmon was too plain, and the fillet mignon was meh. Then we decide to order desserts. Bad idea. We decided to order the chocolate soufflé since I am a big fan of soufflés and he likes chocolate. Their \"soufflé\" isn't a soufflé, it's a chocolate lava cake. I used to be a baker/patissier, so I know I'm not mistaken because I've made thousands of soufflés myself before. Plus, it is too sweet, and the berry sauce that they placed with the dish didn't help either, because that one was too sweet as well. Good thing the dish came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to balance it out a little bit. Overall, it was an unsatisfying meal. If we're paying almost $150 for our food, I expect something better. I give them three stars because our server was fantastic. 5* for service, 1* for food."}
{"text":"My steak was good though not great. The appetizers were excellent. The Maui Wowie salad was wowie. I sampled some of the seafood entrees from others and regretted choosing the steak. The service was professional. The setting within the J.W. Marriott resort in the north Phoenix area known as Desert Ridge is nice, but it still feels like a very corporate chainish environment since obviously that's what it actually is. Entrees were about $30 per entree and at that price-point my expectations are always going to be high, so the merely \"good\" steak was a disappointment. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing the Aloha Hour only and those 2 hours are great! Top notch drinks and apps from 4:30-6:30.  All drinks and appetizers are $5 and worth every penny!  The first time my friends and I went we ordered all 6 apps and all of them were delicious.  There's something for every taste. My favorite two if I had to choose would be the Wagyu sliders and the calamari. I've been there twice in the last week and a half and I could still go back!  The drinks are on the sweet side but side nicely with the apps.  Check it out!  You will not be disappointed!  Service is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Probably the worse filet mignon I've ever had... luckily I've only had it about 10 times in my life. Tough and not \"melt in your mouth\" like other times I have had it, but unfortunately about the same price. I added on loaded mashed potatoes, they were very salty. If you were a friend that was coming here, I would say; stick to the bar menu... the dinner menu is priced like a fine dining restaurant, but tastes like a hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"We had dinner at this Roy's for the second time during another trip to Vegas and it was just as delicious as the previous visit in 2010.  There were three of us and we each had a different entre:  Mahi Mahi, Opakapaka and blackened Ahi.  Each was cooked perfectly and the plates were clean when removed from the table.  My wife's pear and candied macadamia nut salad was also wonderful.  Service was also outstanding in al respects.  I have eaten in Roy's restaurants in Hawaii and on the mainland many times and have yet to experience a bad meal or service, so they are highly recommended.  If you would like to have a very nice meal off the strip give this place a try.  I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Roys is always fabulous! Get in early for their Aloha Hour and grab some great drinks and apps for just $5 each. We stayed for dinner and the chefs and servers NEVER disappoint! Soooo good!  Their sushi is very good, as are many of their main dishes.  Any you should really consider the molten chocolate souffle!  YUM!"}
{"text":"ummmm....How about AMAZING! Came for a wedding celebration (8 people).  Service was great and food was better. I didn't like what was suggested to me, quickly the head chef came out and apologized I was brought another order in time for me to finish eating with the rest of the table.  It was scrupdiddilyotious! I absolutely loved the desserts, atmosphere, and my drink was gooooood."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancee have been to Roy's several times now.  My first time was in Hawaii.  When I saw this location we definitely had to try it out.  We came for Easter Brunch last year (Pricey!) then a couple more times after that for romantic dinners.  Each time has been awesome.    We spent valentine's day here and I am very happy we did.  We had a four course dinner and each entree was timed perfectly and was delicious.  Service was great. My beverage was excellent. The dessert was delightful. The patio was pretty and romantic with the tiki torches.  Only drawback is that portions are kinda small and its pricey.  They do have a great happy hour, or actually its called \"Aloha\" hour.  This is  One of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Every year we come to Las Vegas for our anniversary and Roy's always accommodates our request to make the wasabi cream sauce for the butterfish - like they used to serve it years ago. Food and service are always wonderful and we will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Roy's and it was a good spot for date night.   My steak was properly cooked and the sides were nice too.  My wife's lobster, scallops and shrimp according to her were wonderful.  Service was really attentive.  Not the place for people on a budget though."}
{"text":"How horrible can a manager be? Ask them at Roy's! We were sitting in the bar area and were asked to move to a completely new table because a family came in and wanted to overtake two tables in the bar area. What you should know is that the dining room was completely empty and the other did where we were sitting had 3 empty tables they could have pushed together for this family or there was ample room for the family to sit in the restaurant. However, the father insisted in sitting in the bar area with his  entourage which included his children. The manager came out and said he would buy us a drink, how awful to make you get up from your table so they wouldn't inconvenience a family that could have sat in the restaurant. This restaurant only cares about the end sale then treating all customers with respect. Don't go here, you may be re-located halfway into your meal!"}
{"text":"The food was good but not amazing for the price. I had a steak, my husband has teriyaki salmon. I almost liked the veggies on the side better than the meat part of the dish. Caesar salad was  fine but not much flavor. One thing that was really nice- we are on the patio between 6-7 and we were the only people out there!! That is surprising for a beautiful evening in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Solid chain restaurant which serves as one of the better places for dinner in this part of town."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here a bit back and enjoyed the experience. The food and service were both quite good. Despite zero complaints and two very satisfied stomachs, There are places I'd rather go for the price. It is hard for me to articulate why, to be honest. Maybe it is just a personal taste thing?  Either way, I would absolutely recommend that you try Roy's out. I can assure you that you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Roys in Summerlin has a nice atmoshere. I went in and ordered the pre-set dinner $35. Quality of the food is very good along with the service. I would caution people that while quality is very good protions are small. I have to give it a good rating because of the overall visit."}
{"text":"Canoe Appetizer for Two Thai Peanut Chicken Satay, Vegetable Spring Roll, Szechuan Ribs Spicy Tuna Roll, Kim Chee & Shrimp  Very tasty with a nice variety, plenty of food for two  I'm disappointed in the spicy fried rice it tasted very dry & no flavor   The spicy tuna rolls were Devine ! Lots of flavor & very fresh   The spare ribs were tender & fell off the bone   I'll be back for another dessert ah the chocolate soufflé was awesome"}
{"text":"Cannot express how great this place is . I have seen Roy's tiki torches outside since I've moved down the street and it has always been a place we wanted to try. Finally on Christmas Eve with family visiting we made a reservation at Roys on open table. Walking into Roys we were greeted by several friendly and professionally dressed hostesses who immediately sat us to our table. All the servers and assistants were super friendly and very professional . The menu and specials were explained in detail , she also provided her recommendations ! The food was simply amazing I have not had such a selection of fish and seafoods in a long time ;) def a must try asap ."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants!!  We discovered there was one in Chandler and it just happened to be extremely close to our hotel.  We went for Happy Hour and had some drinks and appetizers.  My wife loves the pineapple martini, and I had the Kona longboard, which is what I had at the Roy's in Hawaii.  An authentic Hawaiian beer!  The spiced pork ribs are awesome and tastes great!  The spring rolls were good too, but not as good as the ribs.  I ordered the butterfish, which is a great, tender, mild fish.  My wife had the ahi tuna entree.  Both were delicious, properly cooked and tasted fresh (although I don't know if it was).  The sauce on the butterfish was great, although there was a hint of wasabi, which I didn't really like.  It also came with black rice, which tastes almost like risotto with a sweetness.  I didn't care for he rice too much, but my wife liked it.  And, of course, we got dessert.  Chocolate soufflé for me, and the pineapple upside down cake for the wife.  Both were delicious, but you need to order it early because it takes 20 minutes to make.  We need to give kudos to our bartenders, Justin and Samantha.  We sat at the bar and they served us dinner and drinks all night.  They were very attentive to our needs and chatted us up a bit when things were slow.  Truly professional, friendly, and both made great pineapple martinis.  Loved the drinks, food, and the overall experience!!"}
{"text":"We come back almost every year for the butterfish, they never disappoint. Entree impeccably prepared. All staff from bartender, hostess, waiter are very pleasant and attentive.  Price is very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"We usually come here for special occasions and the staff did an excellent job of making my birthday special!!  We came for the lobster tail offer that comes free if you order the filet mignon or ribeye so we ordered one of each.  Our steaks were cooked to order and the lobster tails were wonderful!!  For my complimentary dessert, we shared the molten lava cake which they decorated with the Hawaiian word for \"Happy Birthday\".  Overall, it was a fabulous way to spend a fall evening at a beautiful resort!!"}
{"text":"The Summerlin location closed, sad since it was beautiful there. The food & service here is excellent! Attention to detail & friendly staff. The Butterfish Tasted a bit fishy & the Filet Mignon was a bit tough, but everything else was really good."}
{"text":"if you have the opportunity, you must visit Roy's. i was intrigued by all the amazing reviews. I felt confident we would be in for a treat and Roy's did not disappoint.    Our server was Kevin. He was fantastic. Funny, entertaining, patient and helpful. Thoroughly explained the menu and helped us select an amazing meal.  The restaurant is nicely decorated with a contemporary Asian flare with an inviting ambiance.    The Roy's canoe has a delightful assortment of delicious appetizer treats. Just get it...we had the Hawaii Kai Style Beef Short Ribs and Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi and savored every bite.    We can't wait for our next Las Vegas excursion and a trip back to Roys"}
{"text":"Overall: for a chain in this price range I like others better but Roy's does a pretty good job.  Food: quality is what you'd expect from a higher-end chain. Flavor varies greatly. Some dishes are great and others are no better than a fast food Chinese place nearest 'anywhere America' - yes really.  Service: Always very good, never a complaint here expect when they did nothing when my dish was crappy. Did not comp the dish or even offer a desert... no, I did not even finish it.  When to Go: business dinners are the only time I use this place. If I spend my on cash, I go other places and get better food for the same $."}
{"text":"The food was Ok and so was the service, my issue is the portion sizes. We had a private room and a fixed menu, I left this place hungry and I'm of normal height and weight... made a pit stop to Capriotti's afterwards."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience.  To be fair, I should point out that we went specifically for the happy hour/bar specials.  However, things were so good, 5 stars it is without trying dinner.  We wanted to get off-strip a little for my husband's birthday, and had thought we would start here for a little snack and drink or two before moving on to more places.  We never left.  3 orders of tuna poke later (yes, three), plus a bunch of other great appetizers and sushi rolls, we were still there.  Had a number of different drinks - all a good balance of sweet, tart, and alcohol.  When my brother decided to mention it was my husband's birthday, they came out with a little birthday dessert complete with a Happy Birthday chocolate syrup plating and candle.  Finished by a picture of us in a Roy's picture frame.  Made for a fun twist on the visit.  I've seriously thought of the poke a dozen times since - nummy, yummy stuff."}
{"text":"I was at this hotel for an event. On one of the evenings we had a client dinner at this restaurant. To be honest I was disappointed. I had eaten at Roy's in the Big Island and though the menu was lovely it wasn't my kind of food. I picked the best entree that I could but I was very disappointed and it wasn't a cheap meal. Again it wasn't anything wrong with the preparation just didn't work for me. I believe it was some sort of meat with a coke flavored sauce.   We started with the usual apps and drinks outside and it was a lovely atmosphere. The service was great and apps were delicious. Then we were seated for dinner and given a pre-selected menu to choose our options for starters, entrees and dessert. For the starter I went with the classic iceberg salad with bacon bits and blue cheese dressing. Perfect. Then I followed with an entree of a filet and shrimp. OMG...I will have dreams about this dish for the rest of my life. It was served with mashed potatoes as well. But the bearnaise type of sauce was a culinary masterpiece. It was absolutely amazing. I passed on the dessert but know my client had something that looked great. The service was perfection as well. I would stay at this hotel just to have that meal again and again. It isn't often these days that I go overboard on a dining experience because I have been fortunate enough to have a lot of great dinners but this was just special. Oh and the filet was perfectly cooked. No missteps here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Roy's for years in all the restaurants in Hawaii and Arizona.  It is our favorite place to eat, drink and visit with friends.  We've never had a less than a perfect meal there.  The staffs are always amazing and the service is the best.  My favorite is the lightly grilled Ahi with the baby bok choy, always awesome!  There's nothing bad on the menu...excellent place to dine!  Easy five stars!"}
{"text":"So we go for the Aloha Happy Hour. Our order and feedback is as follows  Lobster Potsticker - 1 star, where was the lobster? Look I am not looking for chunks of lobster. But I only taste pork. Is it just me? No my 2 eating companions don't taste any lobster either.  Szechuan Pork Ribs - 5 star, all of agree it was damn good. I mean a must order!  Tempura Crusted Ahi Roll - 1 star, wow I am from Hawaii, I love sushi but this was pretty bad. The rice was like mushy   Ebi Roll - 1 star, same as the roll above. If the rice is mushy how does a chef serve this. Where are the standards?   Wagyu Burger - 2 stars, bun is good, egg is perfect, onions are nice, and the Wagyu beef which was suppose to be the star is salty.  I really love my boy Roy but if he tried this he would have been disappointed. This was definitely not Roy's standards and won't be going back anytime soon to eat. The three of us that ate all agreed.  Service - 5 stars great service, just disappointing food, may go for a drink but not so sure I will eat there again."}
{"text":"Great time at Roy's last night.  I had to go with 4 stars rather than 5 because their Google Place listing displays the wrong address and they know about it and have not fixed it :(.  So, it took a few extra minutes to get to dinner.  That said, the food was great.  The \"ultimate sampler\" (I am sure they call it something else) was super good and so was the chocolate souffle for desert.  It did take about 20 minutes for the souffle to be prepared so here is a tip -- order it about half way through your meal."}
{"text":"Dinner at Roy's was excellent! Our server Michelle was very attentive and helpful.  I started with a Jalapeño Margarita and my husband had the Hawaiian Martini.   We went with the Monday Prix Fixe menu which includes an appetizer, entree and dessert. We asked Michelle about an old menu item they haven't carried in a while (braised pork roll topped with spicy tuna) and without hesitation she asked the chef and he made it for us. Way to go above and beyond!  I had the Misoyaki Butterfish which was cooked to perfection. I just can't explain how delicious it was.   For dessert I had the chocolate soufflé which was served with ice cream and a raspberry sauce. I was so full by the time I got dessert but who could turn down a hot right out of the oven soufflé?"}
{"text":"$110 worth of food poisoning! First off, the illness that came afterwards might have been less irritating if the food had been good. Both of us got sick but we ate different meals. One of us had the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi and the other had the short rib. The mahi mahi was flavorless with poor texture and the asparagus that came with the fish was flavorless as well. Not even a hint of flavor from the sauce. Very disappointing. The short rib had flavor but it was no better than a pot roast that I can make in a crock pot for $10 for 4 meals. Both entrees were served at or below room temperature, which was surprising since the plates were scalding hot. We had an appetizer of ribs that had great flavor. We also shared some edamame and ended our meal with creme brulee. 30 minutes after eating while walking through a casino, we both became very ill. We ended up having to sit for about an hour while sipping on Sprite to calm our stomachs before we could even move without getting sick. We also had to have peppermint lifesavers to help our stomachs when we didn't have Sprite. The nausea would come and go for the next 3 or 4 hours and we were breaking a fever. We know that it had to be the food at Roy's because it was our first meal of the day. All in all, the food was overpriced and flavorless and to top it all off, we were very ill. We will never eat at another Roy's again and will be telling our friends not to go there...ever."}
{"text":"I'm a little late in getting this review posted.  Our dining experience was in December, 2017.  Our family visits us here in Arizona every year and this year they stayed at the Marriott over Christmas and we always dine at the hotel's featured restaurant and our December, 2017 family dinner was held at Roy's Restaurant at the Marriott Desert Ridge.  I wanted to give accolades to the nice young man PJ at the host station upfront.  We did some last minute shuffling when we arrived which he managed with nothing but professionalism and a smile even though they were clearly very busy so a big shout out to him for making our experience positive from the very start!  Our dinner, service from the server and assistant was very good considering we had a large party of adults and children and again, they were busy, busy the night we were there.  Food was excellent as expected, everyone at the table was pleased. The only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars was because our primary server was a bit harsh and hard on the person assisting him, openly barking orders to the assistant while he spent a lot of time standing around not doing a whole heck of a lot.  The primary server seems to have it made here with their assistant's doing all the running around and harder work tending to the tables.  I hope they are generous when tip sharing as the assistant did much more for the table than the primary server.   Before we even completed dessert, we all agreed that even if the family didn't stay at the Marriott this next year, we'd all be returning for our annual holiday dinner at Roy's as it truly was a stress free, enjoyable night for us all!"}
{"text":"Love happy hour at Roy's! It is our favorite date night spot. $6 apps and signature drinks. I crave the original Hawaiian martini and the spicy tuna roll. Sliders with sweet potato fries are delish! Have dined here for supper on our anniversary and everything was excellant. The Szechaun pork ribs were amazing. Surf and turf was great, and the pineapple upside down cake with coconut ice cream was so tasty. They even brought out a mini desert sampler and had a special menu insert with our names on it wishing us a happy anniversary."}
{"text":"well off the strip but well worth the trip. that's my take on Roy's in Las Vegas on Flamingo Blvd.  warmly greeted as we came in - quickly seated as i have made reservations prior to my arrival.  the decor of the restaurant is very inviting. classy - but doesn't make you feel uncomfortable if you decided to show up in shorts and a t-shirt. the ambience around was pleasant - soft chatter amongst the tinkering of silverware to plates and the kitchen working in front of your eyes in the center of the restaurant.  what i found impressive was the attention to detail. with myself wearing dark attire - i was given a dark lap napkin while my mom who was wearing lighter colors recieved a white lap napkin.  looking thru the menu - i was salvating from everything on the list - even more so when seeing that i can get such great dishes from under $30!  everything was great from the miso butterfish - to my surf n turf meal. filet was cooked to perfection and the lobster tail was succulent to the shell. wrapped it all up with the chocolate souffle and a glass of wine.   the service was great, the food was spectacular, and the price was right. i'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"First of all let me just say... Best Mai Tai I've ever had! I really enjoyed the atmosphere here. Everyone is very nice and friendly, prompt service too!   I ordered the Miso Soup and Hibachi Salmon and it was absolutely delicious! Hats off to the chef! Definitely worth a trip back to try more of their food and drinks!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a diner here with one of my cousin on a Vegas weekend. KEVIN has been our server, and even though I overheard he has been working over there for the past twelve or fifteen years, you would think he would know some basis of the job, let me explain. Kevin had several tables at the moment, but we had a reservation and got seated right away. The service was very slow and it took a good 10 min to be greeted and place a drink order. He quickly brought the drink but then disappeared for awhile. We ordered our appetizers as well as entrees, and please do yourself a favor, DO NOT order the fried rice. Its watery, disgusting and getting a side is way too much with an entree as long as you don't share and get one per person. If Kevin would have been more listening to my questions and not being so stressed out for some dark reasons, I could have known that every dishes had a side. I didn't want to be rude so I haven't complained about my rice but it tastes like s***. (Sorry.)  The menu doesn't mention which side comes with which entree, at least not clearly enough. While our dinner, I've been a little surprised being watching our server Kevin getting plates ready at the window and passing his right hand into his hair, right before to serve plates to a table, without washing his hands.  That's just one of the basis of the job, hygiene. Maybe having an open kitchen to the floor is a little bit tricky !"}
{"text":"yum just like you were in Hawaii. The fish was fresh and the service was good. Lots of good wines to choose from. I have a gluten allergy and they were very good to work with me. Love that. Tuna for me. Very happy."}
{"text":"This is a very classy and trendy restaurant. I am here with my girlfriend and we didn't wait more then 5 minutes before being seated even though there was a very packed house. The waiter Thom was very polite an attentive and the food was phenomenal. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I sought out Roys for the advertised Gluten Free fare.  The service was great almost to the point of magical.  My glass was never empty and all my questions were answered.  The food, however, was just ok. Especially for the price.  My beef lacked flavor and was a little tough. the lettuce wraps were good, but not amazing.  The ice cream served witht eh souffle was generic and lacked vanilla flavor."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written my review for Roy's sooner! Andy and I come here a ton. The happy hour is amazing. Between the Mango Mojitos and the Lobster Potstickers you can't go wrong. A few other HH items we enjoy are the braised short ribs, ahi sushi, and fish tacos.   We came here on our 1 year anniversary (2 years ago) and had a true memorable experience. The entire staff was so sweet and every single person wished us a Happy anniversary. We had the blackened Island Ahi. So amazing, it had this spicy mustard sauce that was to die. The seared scallops were also delicious. ...don't even get me started on the chocolate soufflé...   We absolutely love the bar staff, especially Nathan. Thanks for all the amazing times. We are sure to make more memories at our favorite seafood restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is the second Roys that I have been to and I really enjoy this one as much as the first. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the attention to detail is obvious. We order a whole bunch of appetizers that were all fantastic and some signature drinks. I look forward to coming back to Roys next time we are in Vegas! I would have given it a 5 star review but because its off the strip and we needed to take a $20 cab ride there and back, this had to be factored into the review."}
{"text":"We booked our anniversary dinner using the open table feature on yelp. From the moment we stepped in the door and told them our name they were wishing us a happy anniversary! The service was absolutely amazing by Nico and so was the food! They def went above and beyond for our anniversary. From the note in our menu to the special dessert. They even took our photo and printed it out for us to take home!  I def recommend Roy's for your special occasion...or any occasion because it was that amazing. Best anniversary dinner to date."}
{"text":"This had been one of my favorite local restaurants. I will give it another chance, but at these prices it better be that \"one bad meal\"- or I'm done paying 100.00 for dinner here.  Decided to splurge for my birthday, so made a reservation for Sat night. Party of 1.   Waiter was good enough, nice guy. He did give me a good recommendation on wine for my second glass. I was happy with him overall.   Their \"signature dish\" Misoyaki Butterfish\" is one I have loved - and ordered every third time I came- for probably 20 years now.   I ordered lobster pot stickers, and they were very overcooked; slightly burned around the edges and slightly tough to chew. This is NOT how pot stickers are supposed to be- and I've loved them previously. (See photo)   Not wanting to start my birthday dinner off negatively, I just ate them and moved on- waiting for the yummy butterfish to come!   The thing about the butterfish has been the delicious Wasabi sauce- slight heat, and slight sweet- that yummy wasabi flavor.   When it came the presentation was a 10! ( see photo) . Was very impressed. My first bite though, was fishy tasting. What? I've NEVER had that happen. Looking at the bottom of that half of the fillet, I could see that dark grey color- which always means a fishy taste. I moved to the other side of the fillet (thankfully the larger side) and had no taste of fishy. Whew!  The other thing is- NO wasabi flavor at all! Just very very sweet. I had loved it BECAUSE of that wasabi kick. WTF?   I did mention this issue  to the waiter when he came by and asked me how it was, and he DID offer right away to replace the fillet, but I decided I would just eat the good part (which was most of it) and again, not have an issue on my birthday dinner.   By now though, I was not happy I had paid $13.00 for hard potstickers and I think it was $42.00 for the butterfish. That's a hefty price for an average size piece of fish- anywhere you eat!  The waiter was sweet to pre order the volcano lava cake for me for birthday dessert (free), and it was perfection- as it had always been. He did then tell me he had taken off the charge for the appetizer due to the butterfish issue. That was decent I felt.   With tip ( generous) it was still 130.00! (2 glasses of wine included)  I think I hit a bad night- the chef/ staff was certainly off.   I will come back- but I will NEVER again order the butterfish. The sauce change alone gives me reason to avoid it.   One more \"fair\" $130.00 dinner and I won't be back again.  I hope that doesn't happen. ************ UPDATE!!! Just ran across another review from late 2017 that complained the butterfish was gray and fishy on the bottom. I don't feel like I'm being overly picky now! Whew!"}
{"text":"before you all start thinking i'm a baller, i've got two words for you. pre fixe. ok, maybe it's one, but i don't speak french.  ask for the prefixe menu - for about $35 a person, you get an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. a screamin' deal for good quality food! the prefixe menu changes seasonally, I think, as my parents went in april and there were slight changes since my visit in december. (on a side note, the siblings and i gave our parents a gift card for dinner here for their 29th anniversary - i mentioned it to the hostess when i was making the reservation for them, and they gave them a complimentary dessert! again. great service.)  the bf and i went here on a whim - (but call at least an hour before you go, especially th-sun; alternately, you can make reservations online as well) and were seated rather promptly.   we ordered some sushi (the sunrise roll), just to see if it was up to par. it wasn't bad, but it wasn't terribly exciting either - so i'd pass on that next time.  appetizers: we had the grilled skewers ( 4 skewers - 1 shrimp, 1 eggplant, and 2 satay beef). one of my beef skewers was more like a charcoal skewer - and our incredible waiter brought me a beautiful new one.   entrees: hibachi grilled salmon and braised short ribs. both were fantastic. the salmon was tender and perfectly flakey and moist. the short ribs weren't oversauced and were soooo goood!   desserts: macademia nut torte - simply divine. but the piece de resistance (so good, it's making me speak french!) was the Hot Chocolate Souffle. oh.my. i would go JUST for that souffle. amazing. delectable. fantastic. spectacular. i'm in love with a dessert.   anyways, go for a superb meal and wonderful service. it's worth the price! (plus, $35/person is actually good for 3 courses!) and if you're bringing a date, valet is FREE with your dinner (get your ticket validated by the hostess). don't make her walk in heels in the bitter december desert cold, like my bf did. but it's ok, the souffle was worth it."}
{"text":"not a fan of this roy's location. and i LOOOOVE roy's.  make the drive, and go to the desert ridge location.   after being seated, we waited for over 15 minutes before our server even remembered to come check on us.   sigh. the service was just sub-par in comparison with the DR Roy's."}
{"text":"Really great food, got their rib eye for less than $30 and it was so juicy and tender. Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"We had such a fabulous dinner at Roy's this past weekend.  Everything was terrific.  The lobster potstickers were a huge hit as were the rib appetizer.  The ono and salmon were fantastic and the toffee blondie dessert was so delicious we practically licked the bowl it came in.  Our waitress was beyond nice.  HUGE TREAT to go here."}
{"text":"Had a business meeting... all in all the food and the service really fell flat... the entire table expressed the same... given the size of the check, makes me scratch my head for options next time...."}
{"text":"This place has great seafood! It's Hawaiian themed with a born of Asian influence as well. It's upscale inside with white linens and lighter woods that give it a Hawaiian feel. They have a nice wall of wine when you enter the restaurant.  Our waiter was very good and knew the menu well. He paced the meal very well and was attentive, yet not overwhelmingly so alike some waiters.  I started with the appetizer sampler (Asian ribs, chicken satay, tuna roll, lobster potstickers, and tuna roll). All of the elements were well prepared and seasoned appropriately.  Then I had the grilled Caesar salad. I really like that the salad wasn't drowning in dressing like lots of restaurants often do.   My entree was seared ahi with rice. It was a perfect seat on he outside, yet tender and rare on the inside. The sticky rice was great as well.  The side order of mac and cheese was very cheesy and rich, loaded with bacon and breadcrumbs."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good.  Thes staff was very attentive.  Expected more from the food.  Not likely to go again.  Not worth the money.  Way too many places with great food, for the same or less money."}
{"text":"Wow amazing food! Loved the atmosphere..classy environment with courteous and professional staff. Chef was a gentleman who came to the table to allow me a few moments to express my gratitude for a wonderful meal and time. Last but not least the Jack & Jill martini...omg! Can't believe it took me 8 years to discover this wonderful Restaurant.   The fish trio was my meal selection and had the appetizer sampler! The prices were fair for a gastronomic experience at this level."}
{"text":"I dined at Roy's on New Year's Eve and thought the experience was okay.  The menu offered during NYE was a 4 course prix-fixe menu with the price dependent on the type of protein you ordered as your entree.  I decided to go with the scallops but was disappointed.    The scallops were a nice size but were not cleaned properly and were gritty.  The sauce was too sweet for my liking.  However, I did enjoy the array of appetizers we ordered and really liked the beef tartare.   The appetizers were good as well and I enjoyed the banana split topped with pieces of mochi.    I'd be willing to give Roy's another chance but won't be ordering the scallops next time around."}
{"text":"Amazing. We travel to Hawaii every year and every year we come home missing the flavors of Hawaiian fare. No more. I have seen and heard of Roy's for many years and for whatever reason we had never dined there. Last night we decided to make a reservation and try it out - so delicious! Our server, Zack, was awesome. We were his first table and he was very knowledgable regarding the menu and helping with a wine pairing. My husband and I have added this restaurant to our list of favorites! We'll be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great dinner and enjoyed awesome service!  Had the mahi mahi.  Also had sushi."}
{"text":"Presentation was amazing, but the portion was quite small. Overall, great customer service and tasty food, just didn't get full."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how much I enjoyed this restaurant. The service, the cocktails, and the food were amazing! The short rib was probably one of the top 5 dishes I've ever eaten. The restaurant is small, but luckily it wasn't packed. I realized it is off the strip and some people may not find that suitable, but I promise the short taxi ride it takes to get there is well worth worth it. You can chose to dine at one of the million restaurants on the strip, but trust me.... most don't compare."}
{"text":"We decided somewhat on a whim to try out Roy's when we caught word that they had their Grand Prix 3 course meal for $36. All and all, it was quite a pleasant experience. The service was great, everybody was incredibly welcoming and our server was quite knowledgeable about the menu.  They start all the tables off with some edamame seasoned with some sort of a mildy spicy seasoning and also surprised us with some sort of a sushi roll that was very fresh. All of the people in our party ordered the Grand Prix so we all got to taste a fair amount of item there. Among the appetizers ordered, the stand-outs were the grilled szechuan spiced baby back ribs & lobster potstickers. Let me first say that Roy's does NOT skimp on their portions. The appetizers themselves were the size of many finer restaurant's main entrees. The baby back ribs were made very tender. The sauce was a tiny bit on the sweet side, but other than that, the meat was juicy and pulled right off the bone. The lobster potstickers were quite delicious. The light soy dipping sauce didn't overpower the sweetness of the meat inside the potstickers. They were cooked just to perfection, without burning the bottoms or having that doughy starch taste of being undercooked.   After the appetizers, we were all quite excited as everything thus far was delicious. Now onto the main courses. I personally ordered Citrus Tarragon Grilled Salmon. I wasn't too pleased with the item as it wasn't very well grilled. It was charred too much on the outside of the fish and lacked that nice gradual progression to slightly rarer meat in the middle. Their Misoyaki Butterfish which was absolutely delicious. Incredibly succulent and flaky with a very light misoyaki sauce to complement the meat. My girlfriend got the flat iron seared scallops which was also quite delicious. The scallops were enormous and cooked to near perfection with the natural flavor of the scallop still being the main focus of the dish.   Last but not least, the desserts. Amongst the table, we tried just about everything on their dessert menu and the key lime creme pie, creme brulee and chocolate lava cake more than held their own. Roy's did an incredible job on the presentation all throughout or meal but their desserts were really well decorated with sugar sculptures skying well above the plate and desserts themselves. Decadent, smooth and rich, not much else needs to be said.   All in all, the dining experience was very pleasant. The food held its own and the portions were very generous. And one cant complain about a nice 3 course meal like that for a VERY reasonable $36. I look forward to my next experience there!"}
{"text":"Update: Roy's manager called and was very apologetic and kind. We will go back for another meal. Thank you for caring enough to contact us. It is clear the experience is very important them, and I am impressed he took the time to empathize and ask for another shot. Thanks again.    We had a gift card and wanted a nice evening. Food was good, but the service was not. We had Anthony for our waiter and we were clearly forgotten... we waited to have appetizer dishes cleared to receive entree- we had about 3 bites left when he came to see if we liked it. We were never asked if we wanted another glass of wine. We didn't, but he didn't know that. Anthony needs some retraining - I won't go"}
{"text":"Just came back from LV over the weekend. Had the pleasure of going back to Roy's since most of the places in the casinos are booked solid over the weekend. We had the tempura roll apetizer. It was a fresh departure from the normal rolls. The filet and shrimp was excellent. Atmosphere was nice and the staff were attentive."}
{"text":"Our anniversary was last month, so we decided to have a nice dinner at a new place. A friend recommended Roy's and I'm so glad we listened!  My husband told them it was our anniversary when he made the reservation, but I never imagined the treatment we would receive. When we arrived, our menus had an insert with our names, congratulating us on our anniversary. Every staff-member who stopped by wished us well. Even though we both ordered the winter prix fixe menu that came with dessert, they still brought out a lovely passion fruit cake for us as well.   Before we left they asked if they could take a picture and then brought us the photo in a souvenir (paper) frame, signed on the back. It was the perfect reminder for the amazing evening!  And lest I forget, the food was incredible. I had the braised 5 spice duck leg to start, and it was rich, complex, and absolutely delicious. My husband had roasted beet and goat cheese salad with lemon grass vinaigrette which was light and refreshing. Both of our main courses (salmon for him, mahi mahi for me) were delightful, especially the meyer lemon sauce on mine. The molten chocolate dessert was rich and decadent....everything was pitch perfect!  We will always keep Roy's in mind any time we're looking for a fabulous dinner with an amazing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I was surprised that they have such a great happy hour, they call it Aloha hour.  But come early because it gets packed.  The chocolate souffle is a MUST every single time I go to Roy's.  Order it early because it takes them a little while to make the oozing cakes of goodness.  I could live off of their souffle!  Can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"We first ate at Roy's at their Kauai location. I'm glad to say that their food is as good in the desert as in the middle of the ocean.   Service is always good, food for the most part has been delicious, save a couple times were a new entree or appetizer didn't lived up to the waiter/waitress hype.  The drinks are very good, perfect blend of alcohol and mixers. I am not a wine connoisseur but the times I ordered wine by the glass I have been more than happy with my selection.  Overall, good food and service."}
{"text":"Always love coming here.  We usually ask to be seated outdoors and its beautiful.  Menu is constantly changing so dont be surprised if your favorite is no longer available.  We love the chocolate souffle so be sure to order so it is ready in time for dessert.  We always bring our friends to Roys... makes a good impression!"}
{"text":"(Per usual, forgive the length)This review is based on one of our favorite activities...a Wine Dinner.  My wife and I attended the Duckhorn Vineyards Wine Dinner on August 23rd.  It was a class act from the amuse bouche (jumbo prawn with watermelon, avocado purée and white balsamic) paired with a Duckhorn Sauvignon Blanc to an amazing dessert of brown macadamia nut shortbread and lemon marscapone mousse.  In between, we thoroughly enjoyed courses of a delicious big eye tuna tartar, King Salmon and pan seared filet mignon!!  Everything was cooked to perfection, the Duckhorn wine pairings were chosen to highlight each course and the chef and distributor provided a lot of fun and interesting facts about their offerings.  Enjoyed it so much that we put reservations in for the September Wine Dinner without knowing anything about it except the date and time.  This was not our first visit to Roy's, which are always top notch, just the most exciting."}
{"text":"I shared the Japanese Style Misoyaki Butterfish,  A Hibachi Style Grilled Salmon , and the short ribs from the appetizer menu with 2 other people.   The food itself was very tasty. Everything seemed to be on the sweet side to me. The short ribs weren't spectacular. flavorful, but I've had better. The grilled salmon was good, but the butterfish trumped everything; definitely, the best out of the three dishes.   The portion size is a little disappointing. But as the menu is a little bit on the pricey side, ranging from $25-35. So if you're on a budget, sharing is a good idea..... before the food comes out that is. I was satisfied, but could have eaten more.   For dessert, we also ordered their chocolate souffle, which is actually a molten lava cake. I was thoroughly disappointed that it wasn't an actual souffle. The molten lava cake is good, but that just wasn't what I was expecting and therefore left disappointed with dessert.  The service, however was excellent. Our group of 9 walked in without a reservation and were seated within 20-30 minutes."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it as always.   The food was great although the Cesar salad was a bad luck for me.   The waitress Alex was fantastic.   Love this place."}
{"text":"My original opinion was that Roy's was one of those obscenely expensive, tourist trap-like hotel restaurants that suckered in hotel guests who were either too lazy or too drunk to venture off the property. Wrong again.   I went here with some business colleagues and enjoyed an excellent experience. Had the seared tuna (and I'm not a fish-in-a-restaurant guy) and it was very flavorful and accompanied by a wasabi sauce I wanted to take a bath in. Service was excellent, although we were a table of 10 with an expense account. Perhaps they smelled blood, or at least this week's grocery money.   My favorite part of the night, and I'm sure it's standard fare at high end places, was that they brought out a selection of reading glasses when I needed to read the small print of the menu. Call me rube if you'd like."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with amazing food and service. They have a sit-down and bar seating area with a full bar. They serve Asian fusion food, which I am not particularly fond of but they do a great job with the flavors. They do have happy hour as well and does offer pretty good deals during this time."}
{"text":"The food here is great... so long as you are getting the proper service to go wtih it.  When your service sucks, it tends to leave a bad taste in your mouth which doesn't make the food very appealing.  We've been here a couple of times and even gone to the one on the Big Island in Hawaii because we like one thing so much... The Lobster Potstickers.  I'd give Roy's a 5-star just for those because they are sooooo delicious.  The first time we came we fell in love with that appetizer by itself and just enjoyed the other items we ordered (sushi / steak).  The second time we went there, the service was absolutely terrible to the point where I complained about it to the manager and he asked, \"so what do you want me to do about it?\"  Needless to say that if I were a different person I would have walked out on my meal and told him to enjoy paying for my meals but I swallowed my pride and paid our $150 tab and even gave a tip.  I just won't be going back anytime soon...  *high five cocky manager*  So great food... terrible service 2/3 times I've gone."}
{"text":"I have been to several other Roy's locations and they have always been absolutely fabulous. Everything from the service, to the attentiveness of the staff, to the delicious food, and gorgeous ambience inside the restaurant. Every staff member you pass greets you- at my home location in Los Angeles (where I celebrated my birthday) every staff member I passed even wished me a happy birthday! Mindblowing stuff. The lobster gyoza are wonderful and I am a huge fan of Roy's Trio, with the misoyaki butterfish, macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi, and teriyaki salmon! The flavors make the food just melt in your mouth. My boyfriend got one of the Chef's creations with Hawaiian ono that he said was amazing as well. We celebrated his birthday and the staff took the obligatory picture and brought out a complimentary and truly delicious dessert for him. It was all lovely and my boyfriend had a fantastic birthday dinner.  My only complaint, and the reason I don't give this location five stars, is that the restaurant was large and not that busy. There were tons of open tables in every room. Despite this, we were seated at a table that was literally situated a foot from an open booth nearby (that had a family with young children in it). My chair was the one closest to the booth and I felt not only that I was being intruded upon, but that I was intruding on THEM since my left arm was practically resting on their booth table! The staff couldn't have seated them ANYWHERE else? We were seated before the family was and there was no reason to have us camped next to each other cheek and jowl. It did detract from my overall dining experience, and this place is pricey already to begin with. If I'm going to enjoy a nice $35 entree with my $15 cocktail, I would like to not have a family of four shouting into my left ear."}
{"text":"Good quality food, good service but not exceptional like I expect from Roy's.  Butterfish itself gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"One of those spots... That hits the spot ! $$ is worth the bucks.   You can't go wrong with the selections."}
{"text":"Roy's is a chain that I've been going to for years.   We like to try different places but sometimes you want that place where you know what to expect and still want quality.   It's really my go to place for any occasion.    The fish is always the star for me however I've had a lot of different things on the menu including the filet mignon and the seafood dishes.  The menu changes often, but they always have Ahi tuna and the chocolate souffle is a staple at Roy's.  On Valentines or New Years they usually do a prix fixe.   The service is good and the ambiance is just right.  Not too casual but not too dressy.  I can wear jeans, the Mrs can dress up and we are blending.    I don't really care it's a chain either.  Some of my favorite places are technically chains.  Is Roy's perfect on every visit?  No but you can tell that they try to be top notch.   They do enough and the food is good enough to keep me coming back over and over.  Isn't that really the sign of a good restaurant?"}
{"text":"Our two entrees were presently nicely and tasted delicious. I had the salmon ponzu sauce which was cooked to perfection, light juicy and flavorful. It came with a heart (aw) shaped sweet white rice with garnish. It was a good size portion and very satisfying. My hub had the short rib, mashed with broccolini and his was filling, hearty and delectable.   Then the piece de resistance was the chocolate soufle, rich and decadent, yum.  Outdoor musicians serenaded the guests. Great evening."}
{"text":"So slow! Waited 30 min between courses. Entree dish was barely warm- the manager removed the charge for the dish. Food was good, not the service I expect at its price point. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Food was okay. 3 of us got the surf and turf. They over cooked our filets. The desert however was delicious. We got the cheesecake, frozen s'mores, trio of creme brûlée = yum. Next time I'd stick with fish. No meat."}
{"text":"LOVE love LOVE love LOVE love LLLLLOOOOOOOVVVVVVEEEEEEE Roy's!  -The calamari -The sushi -Happy Hour -Dessert -Macadamia nut crusted Mahi Mahi -And the service, oh  the service! It's always wonderful!  This is truly a favorite of both the husband and I! :)"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 6 last week. Service was excellent. The atmosphere was great. I like the full selection/choices of wines. I had a Merlot for the table. App for the table were calamari, caterpillar rolls, poke bowl, and lobster potstickers - all very good and fresh. Anyway, two of the group order the roasted Macademia nut crush Mahi-Mahi entrees were a bit overcook but flavorful. Two other had the shell fish sampler - they ran out of scallop that night- so got a crab cake substitute. Must say that the crab cakes were not as good as Chula's or Fleming's...but enjoyable with good size lobster tails. I had the Filet Mignon with Teppan Shrimp -  And that was a well ages and tasty steak! It was spectacular of the night. We finished off the table with two Souffle \"LAVA\" cake with Vanilla ice cream. That's pretty sum up a great dinner.  Why 4 star and not 5 - no scallop, the \"well done\" Mahi Mahi, and not enough crabbies in the crab cakes."}
{"text":"I didn't know until after we ate here that Roy's is a chain. I might have judged it more harshly had I known that beforehand. I know it's not fair, but I always root for the ma-and-pa-type places. Anyway, Roy's serves what they call \"Hawaiian Fusion,\" a blend of Asian and European flavors, using local ingredients, with an emphasis on seafood.   My husband and I went here for a date night (a rarity for us). The ambiance was lovely: Hawaiian without being like we were in a theme park. The service was attentive-- as it should be for an establishment with this price tag.  We had Lumpia (like an egg roll) for an appetizer, and it was very good. My entree was a different story though. I had the Chicken with Gorgonzola and I thought it just good-average. Dave had the Grilled Atlantic Salmon and loved it (but how can you screw up salmon?). The portions are rather small, although the presentation is very nice.   The dining room was very loud, and although as the parents of teenagers and toddlers we were used to it, Roy's might not be the perfect place for a romantic wedding proposal (Will I what???)"}
{"text":"Look for a deal via Travelzoo! We added to the special occasion experience with cocktails and sushi rolls; they provided an extra dessert and photo card. Nice ambiance; good service and delicious food. They offered gluten free and vegan options."}
{"text":"This place is excellent every time we go, Steak is on point as well at the Mahi. Go for the Swordfish when in season you will not be disappointed. Went there for my birthday and they had my name printed on a piece of paper right inside the menu wishing me a Happy Birthday and then they brought out cake. It was very nice. Can't forget the spicy Edamame. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service however they have an odor problem at the males bathroom, there is an open drainage where all the unpleasant aromas flows thru. Stinky smell.  Tomas was our sever he was very helpful and kind, made good recommendations. Had the pork ribs as a starter and my wife had the wayguy gyosas, gyosas were ok but the ribs were outstanding, one of the best ribs ever. Then I had the scallops with pork belly and it was a superb dish! My wife had the prim fix menu that had a macadamia crusted Mahi Mahi And short ribs, the ribs were so tender and flavorful no doubts the best short ribs ever, fish was average."}
{"text":"Roy's is our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. Sometimes I get their Prix Fixe menu which costs less than $40 and includes 3 courses from a limited menu. We always get the chocolate lava cake. It's the best, but order it early as it takes about 20 minutes to prepare.   We go to Roy's to celebrate special occasions. They will usually ask you if you're celebrating anything special when you arrive. If they know that you are, they make the night special by giving you a framed photo of your group along with a chef's choice dessert.   Just a heads' up. We tried their happy hour once and the food specials were incredibly small. The sliders were about the diameter of a quarter. Why bother? LOL.   Stil our favorite place, the menu is always changing, the food is great and the service is very personalized."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the entrees were 4 stars. App was 3 stars, service was great, ambience doesn't do anything for me, 2 stars.  We were staying at JW for a Father's Day staycation and thought we would finally hit up Roy's. I have friends who just love this place and unless we should just be going for bar bites and drinks during aloha hour, I don't get what the appeal is.  We had no reservation which wasn't a problem. The hub only brought shorts and tees, again not a problem. We were seated in a booth, greeted promptly and drink orders taken. All good in the hood.   The child is picky and I wasn't going to waste $12.95 on her kids meal when I knew there was only about 1/2 of a percent chance that she would eat it. She watched YouTube and was rather pleasant during our meal. But my long winded point is that they are totally kid friendly as you would have to be at this type of resort.  We started with the canoe app meant for two people. Anytime there is a pupu type platter, the hubs eyes get wide with excitement and since it was his weekend, I green lit it. After I recovered from the disappointment that it wasn't brought out in an actual canoe, we dug in. There were two of each offering. The steak was cooked well and was delicious. The chimichurri on top (pretty sure that's what it was) on it was so salty! Way too salty--almost gross. The rib was yummy but again, the glaze was too much for me. Around this time, the salt causes me to become a camel and suck down glass after glass of water. The potsticker was good as was the chicken satay. Not impressed, especially with the $30ish price tag.  The entrees were fantastic! I went with the black cod, having had it before and knowing it was up my alley. The preparation was delicious! A lovely glaze made this fish so good! The hub went with the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had a few bites myself and it was yummy.  Because we are such good parents, we let the child order dessert without eating dinner. They wrote her name in chocolate on the plate (which they had asked us for her name when we checked in and we thought that was weird but now we know that this is why).  Overall, not super impressed for the price of the food. I do want to go back when it's not 120 degrees outside and do the bar bites. The decor doesn't do it for me but the hub says its Hawaiian decor and I'm being silly. So I'll leave that one alone. Our server was great!"}
{"text":"There happy hour can not be beat!!  For $5 per item you get fine dining, quality food.  Every bite was better than the last!  Not to mention the best service!  All there kitchen staff & the bar tender have been there since the place opened, 6 years ago!  To me, that is a sign of happy employees.  And when the staff is happy... the customers are happy.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Everytime we've been to Roy's, whether it was in Honolulu, Las Vegas, Chicago, San Francisco or here, we've never been disappointed.  Yea, it's a chain.  Sue me.  One of the best things about this chain is the consistency in the high excellence of food and service.  We love Roy's, we've been going here for a long time.  I would recommend it just about anyone, even the fussy eaters.  If you are a chocolate lover, make sure to try their chocolate lava cake.  You have to order it along with your dinner as it takes about 30 minutes to make."}
{"text":"Wow!! Do they know how to personalize and make your day truly special!!!  I came here on 4/24/2014 for my boyfriends birthday, which they knew in advance, and couldn't have chosen a better place! The servers and bussers already knew his name, made a personalized menu for him and at the end took and gave us a picture (complimentary). Now to the important part, the food!! We ordered:   -The chefs appetizer: shrimp, short rib, egg rolls, potstickers. California roll -filet and lobster with hash -steak strip, mash potatoes, Brussel sprouts -birthday dessert (tart and a cookie) -chocolate soufflé  -macadamia cake -jalapeño margarita.   Appetizers were so delicious, especially the short ribs which just fell off the bone and melted in your mouth.  The filet mignon was perfectly seasoned and tender, the lobster tail was also nicely prepared and not rubbery and the hash, I forget what it was but it was too good! The steak strip, also perfectly cooked to med rare and the mashed potatoes were super creamy and buttery. All three desserts were delicious, so I can't choose between them!! One of my favorite drinks, the margarita, was made even better by adding jalapeño infused tequila.. It was so good that when I asked our waitress for the kind of tequila, she came back with a paper including the recipe!! Thank you!!!  All in all, from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave, you are truly treated like a king or queen. The staff goes above and beyond to make you feel special and even do extra little things to make sure you leave satisfied. My boyfriend even cried a little... Although he blames the liquor.. :) only con: they removed the charleston location, which was much closer to me. Oh well, I'd definitely travel the distance for another memorable dinner. Thank you Roy's!!! -"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 20, signed an agreement for a $1200 minimum, yet we arrived and our table was not ready. We were told we would have a semi-private dining experience but perhaps our understanding of semi-private is simply different. We pre- ordered appetizers, per their request, yet they were not brought out soon after we arrived. The service was not spectacular but it was not bad either. They were trying their best. The food was delicious. The canoe appetizer for 2 had delicious ribs, pot stickers, tuna, and shrimp skewers. The butterfish and all other main entrees were delicious. The chocolate soufflé was warm, gooey, and yummy!"}
{"text":"Great Birthday Dinner with my Wife last night. They are running a Filet & Lobster Summer Special & it was delicious. Sat outside. Nice music. Great service."}
{"text":"Perfect evening.  Great happy hour w friendly bartenders, Zac and Charles.  Dinner was wonderful! Hubby had  the Ono and I the wagyu meatloaf which was fantastic.  Our server John was attentive and knew the menu! The pineapple upside down cake....."}
{"text":"I believe it is safe now after a half a dozen visits and never being disappointed, to review Roy's.  My most recent visit (last week) was pretty typical. FABULOUS service from a Lady who knew exactly how to successfully wait on a small party. As usual, her impeccable service made the experience all the more enjoyable.  I always have a difficult time NOT having The Butter Fish dish. It had been voted as one of the Top Ten Dishes in Las Vegas when I lived there a couple of years ago and, although I have never eaten Butterfish anywhere else - OUT OF THIS WORLD!  On this particular visit, our party had a couple of Appetizers (Pot Stickers, Sea Scallops) and two salads (Chopped, Maui Wowie Shrimp) as well as the aforementioned Butterfish entrée our other entrees included, Salmon and both of the available Mahi Mahi dishes.  EVERYTHING was prepared superbly and I can honestly say, that outside of Legal's (East Coast) Roy's does fish better than any other Chain, and better than most Independents specializing in fish.  A great treat every visit and this past one was as good if not better thanany!    Can't miss here."}
{"text":"Another five star review for my family and I. We came here for a birthday dinner last month and we had a fabulous dining experience. When we arrived we ordered cocktails at the bar while waiting for our table. I had a strong and tasty Mai Tai.   We started with some sushi rolls and they were excellent. For dinner I ordered the Filet Mignon. It was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. Other people ordered scallops, lobster, and shrimp. Everyone loved everything that they ordered. We saved room for dessert though.   I ordered the chocolate donuts and others got the chocolate souffle, the lime tart and the pineapple upside down cake. Each dessert was fabulous. Rich and indulgent. I can't say enough about the wonderful service either. The staff is always checking to be sure that you have what you need. I'm looking forward to the next time that we get the opportunity to come here again."}
{"text":"One if the only places I will order a rib eye as most disappoint...my wife loves the short rib   Recommended!"}
{"text":"Most delicious mahi mahi, lobster pot stickers in the valley! Great happy hour at the bar or quiet special night out in the dinning area. Pro tip- you MUST trip the flourless chocolate lava cake with raspberry topping. To die for! This is hands down my FAVORITE restaurant. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"We went to Roy's for a midweek dinner & it was so crowded we ended up sitting at the bar. No problem, they serve the full menu.  Until the end of September they have a combo plate available that features both the butterfish & beef short ribs for $30. It's the perfect amount of food & a great choice to be able to try an option from both land & sea. I got to try a bite of the mahi mahi which I will definitely order next time.   Very good service & a beautiful restaurant!"}
{"text":"My steak that was ordered as medium rare was well done and cold. Waited +45mins the waiter said they had many customers and to keep waiting.  Ordered side of mushrooms that were so salty we sent them back.  Not the quality one would expect from Roy's. too bad won't come back."}
{"text":"Everything was divine, including our server: Kevin. The cocktails were strong and delicious, appetizers were served on time and the short ribs were MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.  But, why oh why, Roy's, did you get rid of your famous edamame?!? I don't understand and was very disappointed that they are no longer. I was literally salivating at the thought of eating them. Oh well...that being said, it was an amazing dinner and I'm glad I brought my out of town family there to experience it!"}
{"text":"Roy's is now open for lunch, and I love it! As an avid Roy's lover it is exciting I can now enjoy one of my favorite restaurants for lunch. Not many people must know that they are open because when we went a couple weeks ago it was only us and one other party. But not a problem for us as it granted us excellent service! We started with the lobster potstickers (a must in my book) and the lobster bisque (not pictured) which were both amazing. The lunch potions come on cute little plates served with soup, and side salad, and white chocolate macadamia nut cookie. I got the Shrimp and Pineapple Fried Rice which was enjoyable, but I've definitely had better entrees from this establishment. Great dining experience, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Killer happy hour deals!  $7 drinks and apps can't be beat. All the food was great. You should definitely get the Hawaiian Martini. Don't be fooled by the taste this drink is strong"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's surprise b-day party.  The manager and staff was so awesome.  They put us in the a private room in the back.  They took our cake to the back. Let us set up the area a little for the b-day girl.  The service was excellent.  The food was great too.  I got the mac and cheese side dish & roasted macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi."}
{"text":"Nice, but nothing exceptional.  The place was not busy at all on a Sunday night which I suppose might be expected although I think generally speaking Vegas tends to be humming all of the time.  I think this was just a reflection of the Off the Strip location and the nothing special aspect of the place.  The menu is interesting and our entrees were good but some of the items are way overpriced, namely the appetizer boats which did not warrant at all the price.  Decor is nice although the dining room is a bit too cavernous."}
{"text":"I'm glad I, finally, had the chance to try Roy's....altho it's funny how I never tried this Hawaiian fusion restaurant in my hometown of Honolulu. Go figure. What's even better is I tried this place for my birthday dinner with the Vegas fam/friends.  Service was stellar. Waiters were so attentive, polite, and patient with all our questions about the menu. I felt so special seeing my name on the menu with the \"Happy Birthday\" caption above it. Such a great surprise! Swear, I was smiling from ear to ear and wanted to cry when I saw it. I'm such a sap! lol  Started with the great appetizer of Corzo on the rocks and a splash of coke =) The lilikoi mixed greens was delicious. Not as sweet as I expected from the lilikoi which was perfect because that's exactly what I was afraid of. hehe  Normally, I'd get lamb but, since this spot was known for their fish/seafood (obviously!), I went with the Roy's Seafood Sampler which was lobster, crab cakes, shrimps, and scallops with rissotto and a lobster curry sauce. The curry sauce was kinda of unexpected and different but, good. I just didn't eat much of the sauce lol  Not sure the name of my friend's dish but, it was roasted chicken in some pot. lol Technical name, I know but, it was soooooo good. Reminded me of some homecooked meal my grandma would cook or something. Broth was soooo rich!  Ended with cute desserts!   All in all, I'd love to come back here for more seafood fare. Reading about the happy hour makes me excited to go back =)"}
{"text":"One of the best meals we have ever eaten. Started out with the clams - amazing. Not sure what sauce they were in but it was wonderful. I had the rib eye and my date had the butterfish. Both were exquisite. We topped it off with the pineapple upside down cake and the lava cake. I can't speak highly enough on the food and our server, Mitchell. Top notch all around. It is a bit pricey, but more than worth it for a lovely evening out in Hawai'i!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for our Valentine's Day dinner. The chef had a 4 course meal special going on that day... and since it was our FIRST time experiencing this beautiful restaurant we were even more fascinated with how well our server (forgive me in advance if I get his name wrong.. it was either Koi, or Kai) fine gentleman btw. He explained each dish very well. The ambience and theme of this restaurant is definitely exquisite, slightly dimmed lights (just the right shade) gives the room and elegant and soft atmosphere. Tables are distanced well enough for personal space, and music is very subtle. Staff are very polite and polished. We enjoyed our experience and devoured our dinner. Sure to be back again."}
{"text":"Food was just ok.  Nothing like other Roys i have been to.  Their famous ribs were salty and way overdone.  The half chicken was not very inspiring at all and overdone as well.  The short ribs were dry.  Given how fatty they normally are iit takes effort to overcook that as well.  Probably because it was a slow night the food wasn't moving as quick but given what they charge it is no excuse"}
{"text":"It was ok, but not worth the $$$$. Our main server was not that great, but the others were good. The creme brule was horrid, but the chocolate soufflé was really good. It is way overrated & being from Hawaii we can find better food from little hole in the wall places."}
{"text":"I came for my parents' anniversary and ended up taking advantage of the happy hour. We ordered 12 appetizers (two of each), the Penedes cava wine, and four Mai Tais. Five stars for everything including the service. The Creme Brûlée was perfect: served in a shallow, large-diameter dish to get the most hard shelled top!"}
{"text":"For starters, the crispy rolls were great. I also enjoyed the steak. Go at night and sit outside - the tiki torches give the place a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but a bit pricey.  Service was ok.  The bar only has one small tv so definately not going there to see a game.  Did the $5 happy hour menu, some of the drinks were tasty, but very sugary and the martini glasses were only half filled.  Tried all the 5 dollar apps, they were all good, but very small portions.  For an extra buck a drink and appetizer Flemings blows this place away in quality and value."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend for any occasion. Great quality, presentation, and abundant choices to please everyones taste. Staff was on top of everything.  Will definitely return and spread the word. The food was delicious. Kudos to entire staff, managers and owner"}
{"text":"Hands down a great time with excellent service and even better food. Had a blast here with family and friends last December, rib eye a knockout...will come here again real soon!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Fabulous dinner. Lobster, scallops, shrimp were all excellent. The staff was incredible the ambience was great. We could not have asked for anything better.  I truly appreciate when I read someone's response and it helps me. I hope this helps others enjoy their dining experience."}
{"text":"DANIEL G NEEDS TO BE PROMOTED...  My hubby took me here as a surprise because we like to try new places (new to us). We had horrible service (which will be a separate review by my husband), but I wanted to post a review about our Food Server Assistant Daniel G. He saved the day for our visit, because he was polite, smiled, had a great personality and helped us more than our own server did. Daniel's goal is to be a server, and he is working his way up to that point, but in my opinion Daniel G. should be put into a server position and the server we had should go back for more training."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends and had a fancy dinner. We split the Canoe appetizer for two and that was delicious. It had ribs, tuna rolls and  potstickers. We also shared four of the special sushi rolls, and each picked a drink off their cocktail menu.  Service was courteous, food was beautiful, tasty and expensive."}
{"text":"I haven't written one of these in about a year, but I had to get on here and give Roy's the respect it deserves for having easily the best service in Las Vegas.  We called last minute to get reservations on a Friday and offhandedly mentioned that we were part of a bachelor party. Upon arriving, our menues had special inserts on the front page congratulating the groom-to-be. When the appetizers came, they were followed by a complimentary champagne toast. The meal itself was great, and the mix of different price levels worked great for our diverse group. Some people got a few sushi rolls or appetizers for dinner while others went for full entrees.  When someone from our group asked about splitting the check halfway through the meal, not only did our waiter do this, but he actually split the cost of single appetizers among the people who shared them. This was above and beyond, I wouldn't expect any restaurant to do this, and to be honest, if I was asked I would probably lie and say that the computers wouldn't allow it.  On our way out, the manager asked if we wanted a picture together and took one with his digital camera. Before we got into our cab, we had a printed picture in a cardboard photo frame. What an amazing experience.  We ate at Bouchon on this trip as well, but save a few dizzyingly great plates there, I'd have to say that Roy's was the best dining experience we had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place rules!  I came here for my anniversary and they went above and beyond all of my expectations.  They personalized our menus, served us a free dessert and took our picture which they gave to us complete with a paper frame at the end of our meal.  I tossed the frame but the picture is still up on my fridge.  The food was delicious as well the steak was juicy and flavorful and my lobster tail was soft buttery perfection.  They also have killer happy hour deals, Roys would be hard to beat"}
{"text":"Really disappointed - had a mediocre experience here.  First time here, came with my friend for restaurant week in September. We came on a Thursday night around 7:30 - mostly empty restaurant. The hostess was really sweet. The place itself is clean, and the decor is nice.  We were especially disappointed in the server. He seemed overwhelmed, even though there were plenty of other servers there; he was overall inattentive. This seemed especially prominent once he realized we were doing restaurant week - maybe he didn't think he would get the same kind of tip as a table ordering off the regular menu? Not sure. At one point, a second server even came over to \"help out\", but was equally rushed and didn't really seem to help much. Our server also disappeared for long stretches, especially when we were ready for the check, and came back smelling like smoke. It would have been okay if we could have flagged someone else down - there were plenty of servers standing around - but we weren't able to and had to wait 15-20 minutes just for the check!  I really could have forgiven the poor service if the food had been good, but it was just average. Best things we had: - Lobster potstickers - amazing, very good! - Grilled salmon - pretty good, nothing outstanding but a solid dish  Everything else was just \"meh\", including: - Teppanyaki Shrimp ... not good, bland, mushy fried rice - Grilled ceasar salad - Desserts - the choclate dessert and the raspberry cheesecake, both just fine, nothing special.  Overall, for a $100 meal, I would have expected much better - at least on either the service end or the food end. Both could use some improvement. No wonder the place wasn't busy."}
{"text":"I had been to their Happy Hour last summer and loved it. Appies and cocktails (extra pts for having \"skinny cocktails\") for $5 each. You simply must try this place!   Then...come back for dinner sometime when you feel like throwing down some serious cash for some seriously good eats.  I took a friend there last night as a \"thank you for watching my dog while I was on vacation dinner\" (her choice but I was totally IN) and she was SO happy! We started with cocktails: the Mango Mojito was nice but expensive but I REALLY enjoyed the equally pricey Coconut Frappe off the \"Lifestyle--Under 150 calories\" Menu. That little taste of cinnamon was inspired! And the sweetness really set off the salted/garlic edamame which is complimentary (such a nice alternative to bread, which always fills you up too much to enjoy your meal, no?).  We then proceeded to taste everything on each other's plates so I can personally attest to their 3-course Prix Fixe menu (app/entre/dessert for $37)--she chose the Pan-Seared Trout over Black Couscous (not fishy at all, a bit dry for my taste), the Dim Sum (which was nice but I needed a bit more of the Shiso Herb Purée, which was deelish), and of course the Chocolate Souffle (perfectly rich!). I opted for the Trio, which was on a Yelp special for 30% off ($24 instead of $36, yay! more $ for cocktails!) and featured a sampling of 3 of their most popular fish dishes: the Teriyaki Grilled Salmon (yum), the Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi (double yum!) and the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish (triple yum!!). I can't believe I ate it all! And that's after splitting a Grilled Pear Salad w/ spicy walnuts and blue cheese (dressing was divine!)...whew!  In addition to all this gastric happiness we experienced, our service (from greeter/hostess to waiter to table-busser) was wonderful. Attentive, prompt, suggestive and friendly.   A wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"visited the location in Las Vegas, Monday special is awesome!!!  I went with my wife and food and service were excellent!!!  Thanks"}
{"text":"Ate here last night for the 2007 Island hop dinner. It was a fixed 5 course menu with wine pairings. And everything was excellent. The first course was pupu style Honoka'a spiced sirloin steak. It was a very tasty little starter paired with a Chalone Monterey Pinot Noir...excellent. The second course was pan-flashed big island abalone and crab salad. I think this was my favorite. I dont think its on the everyday menu yet, but they mentioned it would be soon. Third course was seared rare ono sashimi with lobster. Again, this was an amazing dish and the pairing with Bochendal Grand Cuvee reserve South African sauvignon blanc was perfect. I dont usually drink white wines, but that one was really good. Forth and main course was Grilled venison chop, kalbi pork, and Thai citrus shrimp. Probably my least favorite of the night, but still very good. I think I might have just been getting full, or drunk off all that wine :) It was paired with Rosenblum San Francisco Bay zinfandel...thats a good wine too. Dessert was Guava chiffon shortcake with lilikoi and strawberries. Yummy! Overall, the whole dinner was great. And for $85 per person, I left feeling like I got a really great deal on some amazing food. On top of all that, they asked trivia questions about Hawaii between the courses, and I won a $35 Roys seafood cookbook, so that made it even more worth it. And all I had to do was name 6 of the Hawaiian islands...If you want to get invited to these special nights, all you have to do is go to the website and sign up. I definately recommend it. They are fun, educational, and we met some really nice people."}
{"text":"Roy's is suppose to be good. And being my first experience here, it was just TERRIBLE. It was a fusion of untasteful flavors that was just disappointing.   Starting with the drinks, the fruit drinks tasted very off in flavor...chemical flavors, man! Our entire party thought the food was mediocre and quite below par. I ordered the Szechuan Peppercorn Salmon dish with garlic rice and bak choy. My expectations was a very spicy and tasty dish. But instead, the berry toppings were overcooked and the salmon tasted like something I could make at home.   The appetizer platter we tried had a sweet and sour sauce, but it tasted more sour than anything. Eww! Maybe that evening's head chef didn't feel like cooking, but man the food was just bad.   Would this deter me from another visit to Roy's? No. But if I experience it again, Roy's will be off my list."}
{"text":"Closes at 9 apparently? Either that or they just didn't want to serve us at 9:20 for some reason. They looked open to me but the hostess insisted they were already closed for the night. Regardless both Yelp and their website said they were open till 10. Very disappointed, was looking forward to trying this place out for the first time but not interested now! Get it together Roy's!"}
{"text":"All I can say is this place is Outstanding! The food is mouth watering.  We celebrated my husbands Birthday and they went all out. They even had a special page made up for him on the menu. The blackened Ahi was amazing. My husband had the the Sea Scallops and he was smiling ear to ear. For dessert was pineapple upside down cake with ice cream. It was delicious. Service was impeccable. Thank you for a great night out"}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Lobster pots tickets were perfect and the scallops were, perhaps, the best I've ever had.  I'm going back."}
{"text":"We've been to this Roy's half a dozen times, but it's gone down hill the last couple go rounds. We went tonight for our anniversary and was hopeful that it would rebound cause we loved it in the past. Unfortunately, it's gone down hill. Our server was friendly but didn't tell us about any specials unless we asked. The apps came out quickly but can't say the same for our drinks. VERY SLOW!! 15 minutes for a bottle wine! Always get the trio, but was just ok , not great, not to mention our back server was more attentive than our server. Just really sad about this place cause it once was a go-to, but now....prolly won't be back. After 3 sub-par outings, it's sad to say it will be our last time. For a $200 dinner for 2...not impressed anymore."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this is my current favorite restaurant.  My boyfriend took me here for a nice night out for dinner.  We eat out A LOT so we are becoming somewhat of food snobs, lol.  The service, the food, the atmosphere was awesome.  We ordered the dumplings for the appetizer and they are the best we have ever had (and I've had A LOT of dumplings in my 36 years of life)!  I ordered the filet mignon and it came out perfect.  I order my steaks medium well, I know I know, everyone makes fun of me.  Thing is, my boyfriend orders his the same way.  Our steaks were perfect.  A tiny bit pink but the flavor was extremely tasty!  We asked for recommendations for cocktails and the waiter picked out some awesome ones.  He knew exactly what we were looking for.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is the bomb!  So, Miss Dani is a food hoard, and one day I came and ordered 5 items off of the HH menu, and no, I'm not over doing it. The 2 rolls I got were both deep-friend fusion but nevertheless tasty. The Ahi dish was flavorful and made with high quality ingredients and fish.   The service was efficient and very sweet. I got to go baggies to pack up my leftovers which the staff graciously packed up in these neat cute containers. They even packed all the sauces individually in sealed sauce containers. I happily waltzed out of there with a full tummy and a bag full of leftovers for the next door. By the time I reached my car, one of the servers chased me out to give me sauce containers I had accidentally left on the table, so I wouldn't eat my leftover w/o sauce. So cute! Such great service!!!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Roy's is a nice place with great service and some delicately prepared foods - flavors that you can't get in too many places. They prepare Americana foods with some nice, familiar Hawaiian flavors, but with some very fine balance.   For appetizer, we had the lobster California roll which was very good. For my entree, I had the shellfish sampler, which I recommend if you want to get a little taste of everything. The lobster, scallops and shrimp were really good, but the crabcake was spiced too much. I love the flavor of crab with some light spices and lemon. This was so heavily spiced though that I couldn't really taste much of the meat which was disappointing. I am comparing this to Maryland and DC crabs though so if you like Asian flavors masking the taste of crab, you will probably like this. My only complaint about my dish is the size. For the cost of the dish, I think they should give you more than two lone shrimp and a couple more scallops.   They also make a great mango mojito. The most unique part of the meal was definitely dessert - we had the pineapple cake and it was perfectly moist and sweet and the pineapple flavor was not overpowering.   The service here is fantastic. They really seem to care about providing an unforgettable experience and pride themselves on their unique blend of flavors. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the entire menu and was able to pair our meals so well.   Will return, but will try something else."}
{"text":"This review is long delayed.  I have been coming to Roy's in Las Vegas for more than 5 years now.  As a matter of fact, when my husband turned 40 2 years ago, we chose this place for his birthday dinner.  It was wonderful and all of our friends 20 of our friends who came loved it.  One thing that I really like about this place is that they are always very consistent.  Their food selection is healthy, fresh and always delicious.  Service is the best.  They seem to read my mind when I need more water, more edamame, or even when I need a taxi.  The last time I came here was last weekend for Halloween, Tiffany did a great job explaining the menu and making some recommendations.  I was actually very impressed that they proactively split the prix fixe menu for 2 of my friends who were sharing (because they were not very hungry and the other one was sick) and did not charge extra for doing it.  Most restaurants would charge for it or just serve it and just give you extra plates.  Oh I love their service - 5 stars!  I had the prix fixe  menu - the salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned, the stuffed shrimp was to die for and the chocolate souffle just delivered me to dessert heaven.  Oh my!  I am craving those hot chocolate souffle and I don't even like chocolate - figure it out.  Only Roy's can make me feel that way about chocolates  - and that is the honest truth."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday. I was amazed by the waiter: not nagging, but very attentive and timely. The menu was also printed to address me and tell me happy birthday--a nice touch on the behalf of the restaurant. I also received a framed picture of us together. As for the food, we ordered different items and shared. Everything was delicious and the mango mojitos were to die for. I don't know if pineapple upside-down cake is normally served, but I was certainly pleased to have my favorite dessert."}
{"text":"Lobster potstickers!  They are delicious and my little girls loved them too.  We went to happy hour and sat outside around the firepit.  The atmosphere was amongst the best there is.  Happy hour prices were good but portions are really small.  We also had the pork tacos and beef sliders both of which were yum.  The cocktails were top notch.  I don't like super sweet drinks and these were perfectly refreshing."}
{"text":"First off, this place gets points for not only having a gluten free menu, but the food was delicious! We ordered the artichoke heart salad and the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi.  It was cooked perfectly and extremely tasty.  I highly recommend the hot chocolate soufflé - it literally just melts in your mouth!  And it's gluten free!  The crème brulee is good, but crème brulee is always good."}
{"text":"Roy's,  You are fabulous!  Your customer service is phenomenal and my family and I will never forget the way you treated us. Our reservation was at 6pm and we were celebrating my mom's bday.  The employees greet us with genuine enthusiasm and we get seated right away.  Once we get seated, we open the menus, and in our menus were customized menu inserts wishing my mom a \"Happy Birthday!\"  It was seriously really really nice.   Then, we order - mahi mahi and roy's trio (grilled atlantic salmon, roasted macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi, and misoyaki  butterfish).  The food melts in your mouth and you want more.  All of us practically ate everything on our plate with nothing but our forks.    On to dessert - we ordered the pineapple upside down cake and the chocolate souffle.  They bring it out with another complimentary bday dessert with a candle.  It was so sweet - literally and figuratively.    Then, the waiter takes a picture of us and they print it out give it to us - no charge.  We were so surprised by their hospitality.  My sister was so impressed with the way that they treated us, that she now wants her bday at Roy's.  ha.  Quite the experience, Roy's.  Thank you so much.    I was a little disappointed that the restaurant was not as packed as it should be.  I highly recommend this place so please stop by and visit Roy."}
{"text":"Worst birthday experience of my life.  There were eight of us who came from the resort pool to the patio for Aloha Hour, then dinner. First we were told that the patio was closed (on what had to have been the most gorgeous evening of the summer.) That's fine. Inside, it's a little too fancy for our pool-wear, although all but one of us had coverups. So we are decoding what to do, when a server tells us we are dressed inappropriately. We say that we know...we were going to eat on the patio and now we are just standing there deciding what to do (ps the restaurant is completely empty except for about five servers who are glaring at us.)  We go back outside where my elderly father needs to sit down for a moment. Normally after a chilly reception like that I would have left immediately, but my dad can't walk very far, the rest of the party is hungry, and we had really been looking forward to Roy's.  The server comes outside where we are standing (except for my dad who had to sit down) and confronts us. I explain that its my birthday, that we have been loyal Roy's customers in Hawaii and here, and that we just want to have a nice meal.  I explained that we weren't trying to offend anyone and that there really aren't any other customers to offend right now any way. She tells me that I'm being rude and that she is letting us know about the dress code because she doesn't want her manager to see us and come confront us (so instead she does the honors, I guess.) I am so astounded by how outright MEAN this woman is. It baffling. She looks like she's early 50's or so...you think she would know how to handle a dress code concern better.  So the manager comes out, tries to smooth things over, tells us we're all dressed just fine except for one of our well-behaved kids, who needs a shirt with sleeves. Reminds us that there's a sign that says that too (expert managers always point to the policy) Tells us that we won't have that woman as our server. She'll give us \"Debbie, who is fantastic like me.\" Okay. Ha ha. Come in.  We get $100+ worth of appetizers and drinks because the full menu is not available yet. Debbie the server is fine. We watch the sun go down through the window. The only good thing about sitting inside is the fantastic live music by Jared Blackstone.  There is also a a very nice server named Tanner, who had brought my dad some water while we were standing on the patio. He comes over and apologizes to us because he has witnessed this whole thing. He's a class act. Kudos to him and I hope he can get a job at an establishment that values service as much as he does.  The manager never came back by our table. We didn't stay for dinner. Instead we walked across the resort to The Blue Sage, where we enjoyed a great meal on the patio on a  gorgeous night.  The experience at Roy's was one of the all-time worst I have ever experienced in my life."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a beautiful evening tonight! Service was fabulous and the food was outstanding. We celebrated our Anniversary with our 2.5 year old and 8 month old. We ordered appetizers and prior to there arrival our daughter received a kids appetizer, awesome! Love it when places accommodate to families and don't fuss over them. We decided to just order a ton of Appetizers for our dinner. Our favorites were the Waygu sushi roll, lobster potstickers, spicy ahi and ribs. Paradise drink was also great. We order the braised beef on the kids menu and it was a huge serving and t was great. Thanks Roy's for catering to families and good food!!"}
{"text":"Great dinner from the wine to the appetizers to the entree to the dessert. Loved every mouthful. The ambiance is nice but it was difficult to have a conversation because it was so loud in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Fine dining establishments, take note! Roy's offers a dynamic menu with excellent fusion dishes. While the decor leaves much to be desired, the food will soon transport your senses to new places. If you're looking for a great fish dish, I recommend the butterfish. It's a white fish with a rich and creamy texture. The chocolate soufflé is not to be missed and is gluten-free! While not on the strip, you won't be disappointed to grab a cab for this experience."}
{"text":"Lobster pot stickers, divine Butterfish, seared Ahi , chocolate lava cake all to die for!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious meal. Started off with the Maui Wowi salad to share - had lots more shrimp and yummy items than I expected!  My husband had the 4 fish sampler while I had the lobster, scallop, and shrimp with carrots and asparagus (due to my special dietary needs - very accommodating!). Both were exceptional!  Hawaii like atmosphere sitting outside under the heat lamps and tiki torches this winter day. Great splurge for our last day in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Came here with a friend for Aloha Hour, great service, amazing prices of drinks (all drinks $5) from 4:30 to 6:30.   All the appetizer's where cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain, but the eats are high quality here. I take my in-laws here for dinner each Christmas, when I cash out some Amex points for gift cards. This is a nice upscale establishment, with an accessible waitstaff and bar crew. Everyone is very friendly and quite knowledgeable about the menu.  The group favorite here is the prix fixe menu, which gets you three courses. The entrees have varied - the last time I was there only one fish option was listed as the entree. (This is odd for a Hawaiian fusion place.) The short ribs I had instead where quite good, however.  The bar crew here is very good, and they make a killer mojito. No beer on tap, though, which is disappointing. (A nice draft Sapporo would go quite well with the fish.)   The atmosphere is upscale casual, so you can get by in nice pants (even jeans) and a nice shirt. Don't be that guy in the baseball cap, though."}
{"text":"We have been a fan of Roy's for many years whether it's been one of their restaurants in Hawaii, Chicago, or elsewhere.   We have also been to this Roy's at the JW Marriott twice before and have never been disappointed.  However, we went with friends last night and the food was terribly disappointing!  One of their best dishes has always been the butter fish and we looked forward to it all day .... so much so that  3 of us ordered it.  The sauce was too salty and lacked depth and complexity.   It tasted like it was made by an amateur and not up to par with an entree that costs $31.  In fact, it tasted very close to the overly salty teriyaki sauce you get in bottle at the grocery store with cornstarch added to it.  Even the presentation was sloppy.  The cuts of fish were not uniform and thinner than we remember.  Then it was just plopped on a messy glob of Japanese rice that was saturated with that terrible sauce.  The single stem of Shanghai bok choy was lacking a leaf portion.  We know it's only one dish, but it's a signature dish of Roy's and should set the standard for the other dishes.  Hopefully, this  is isolated to this Roy's and not indicative of their other restaurants."}
{"text":"Went to this Roy's a couple of weeks ago and  it's restored my faith in this chain.  The last time we were at a Roy's was the one in Desert Ridge and it was not good.  The food at the Chandler location is more up to par with what to expect from a Roy's.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and as usually, the Butterfish and chocolat soufflé were excellent!  The only negative was that service could have been a little better.  Our server just seemed to disappear for long periods of time.  He was also a little too \"enthusiastic\" when speaking which everyone found a little annoying.  As for the food though ..... great!"}
{"text":"1st time visitor for Birthday dinner.  Had high hopes.  Family of 3 ordered the chefs tasting menu.  Watermelon salad consisted of 5 bite size chunks of melon with a fresh cheese spread & dot of vinegar to touch melon in with a few sprouts atop.  It could have been much better.  The plates sat near the heat lamp too long and were quite warm along with the melon.  I was expecting cold crisp melon.  I really don't like to complain.    The 3 of us ordered flank steak atop sesame spinach with mushrooms.  The other orders of same dish looked appealing.  My entree was quite charred and when I took a bite I realized they covered it with soy sauce to try to soften the charred beef up.  The spinach was also covered in soy sauce.  The two other same entrees were not swimming in soy sauce.  I couldn't eat that.  I did bring it to managers attention.  What kind of chef would let that strap of leather flank steak leave their kitchen?   Molasses tart with vanilla ice cream was good.  Extremely sweet center.  So sweet I couldn't eat all of it. Been there tried it won't go back."}
{"text":"I wish I could eat here every weekend....Kinda.  They are on the pricey side, but you can never go wrong if you can have rice for every meal.  Sorry that's the asian girl in me.    The staff was great, and we ordered the Chocolate soufflé its a must!"}
{"text":"Prefixed menu is very good. Salmon was cooked just right. Nice Caesar salad. Chocolate torte was something that we could eat all the time. And I am not a chocolate fanatic, but this was really good. Off the strip in a quiet area. Nice quiet time to spend with someone special. I've been to several other Roy's in Hawaii and California. Each one is a little different. Always nice to try once during a trip. Mango mixed drink was very nice."}
{"text":"I had thought I had posted a review for Roy's when I dined here last year for Restaurant Week, but I guess I didn't.  That's OK, because I wanted to post a new review after eating here last week for my mom's birthday, and make sure that i gave Roy's 5 stars.  First, I made reservations online, and since my mom has food allergies, I typed some information into the box that asked about it on their site.  It also asked me if we were celebrating a birthday, which we were.  When we arrived, we were seated and discovered that they had a special \"Happy Birthday Susan\" paper printed out and inserted into our menus.  What a cool idea.  After we ordered and they took our menus, they rolled up the papers with a ribbon as a gift.  They also took our picture and printed it out and put it in a paper frame for us to keep.  On top of that, a few different employees stopped by the table to wish her a happy birthday.  No annoying birthday song, but everything Roy's did to celebrate was very classy.  On to the food!  I had their prix fixe menu and had the trout along with a shrimp cake appetizer.  My girlfriend had a shrimp dish, and my mom had the halibut.  We all enjoyed our meals immensely, and the staff brought up my mom's food allergies I had typed in before we mentioned it in person.  For me, it was all a precursor to dessert, though, where I had the chocolate lava cake that came with the prix fixe dinner.  This is simply the best dessert I've ever had, and I'd eat actual lava as a main course just to get to the dessert.  They also brought vanilla bean creme brule with a candle in it for my mom, on the house of course.  Our server Justin was great, as was the rest of the staff at Roy's.  Definitely a place I'll be celebrating special occasions at in the future."}
{"text":"Roy's has been on my list for awhile. I've never heard anything great or negative about the place, but the menu definitely made me salivate.  The cocktails are great, fruity just as I like them.  The wagu roll was good but it needed an element of crunch and some acidity. The lobster dumplings were rich but felt like they were missing something.  I ordered the butterfish. Our server totally sold me on it because it's what their known for, but I didn't like it. The coconut milk was overpowering. The fish was executed perfectly, but all I tasted was sweetness. Way too much sweetness.  The partner ordered the scallops and they were good but the park belly was more fatty than crunch. The fennel greens seemed out of place and didn't blend well with the other flavors. It definitely needed something else to make the marriage work.  Dessert was ok. The lemon was a nice zing to a one note meal."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal and best service by far!  Make sure to order the butterfish and a lava cake (or pineapple upside cake) for dessert! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"This place always reminds me of home.  It's the only place in Vegas where they actually prepare Mahi Mahi how it is meant to be done, moist and perfectly seasoned.  We will make it to Roy's at least twice a year, my favorite appetizer is the Lakanilau roll; seemingly an ordinary dynamite crab roll until they (BAM) drape it with some kobe beef and slightly sear it to perfection.  The Hawaiian Martini will definitely put you on a beach in the middle of nowhere if you have more than 2 and the Molten Lava Chocolate Mousse will put you in a state of complete Zen.  There is more than fish here and the Short Ribs are decent, but go for the Mahi Mahi with the lobster butter sauce and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Roy's is the best place to go for a special event.  From start to finish, what a great expereince!!  We placed our reservation online and they asked if it was a special occaision. Not many reservation services do that, so kudos there.  We indicated yes, my sisters birthday and gave her full name.    First tip - take advantage of Aloha Hour.  ALL SPECIALTY DRINKS WERE $5!!! Best MaiTai I had since being in Hawaii.  A menu of great appetizers was available, ALL FOR $5!!!  We got there about 1 hour before reservation and had a great time in the bar area.  About 15 minutes before our reservation someone from the restaurant came up and seated us early, no problem.    We opened the menus and right away noticed a special note in each wishing my sister a happy birthday. How cute!  Food was EXCELLENT!! The staff was gracious, cordial and as attentive as you could possibly want without even remotely being annoying.  They served my sister a special dessert, took her picture and gave it to her with a birthday note along with inserts from menu.  She felt so special  There is a Roy's in Chicago but haven't gone yet.  Tried to go to the one in Hawaii while on vacation, didn't makeit .  Finally made it to the one in Vegas and now its one of my favorites now!!  Can't wait to try it here."}
{"text":"all i got to say is WOW! this place is amazing the service and food was great!! never had a problem the staff was very friendly n very helpfull ! i asked what would they recomend and pointed out a dish ..so i ordered it n it was really good!...you really do get your moneys worth here at roys and all i got to say is stop by and check it out for your self because i know ill be back!"}
{"text":"My food was cold and the fries was almost like they were soaking in freezing cold water before they were served to me, the steak didn't taste fresh at all. I prefer steak 44 or Flemings or Ruth Chris. The mashed potatoes was lumpy and cold and very greasy, like they had too much melted butter on top. Me and my husband was sick after eating here. I tried to call and complain but they were closed. Roy's in Honolulu was amazing when I ate there so I tried the one here and it's not even half as good."}
{"text":"Love love love!!! The food is amazing. We are kind of regulars at this place. With family previously working there we got to try all sorts of different food. Although the menu isnt huge, they still have a pretty good selection. We went here to celebrate my grandmas and my birthday. The server, a family friend. Was fantastic!!! She checked to see how everything was going througout our meal. It was not overwhelming nor not enough. We even had two complimentary appetizers. This location is more on the quiet side. Unlike in kona Hawaii it is very loud and notthe easiest to carry on a conversation.  Butterfish is great! The pear salad just the right mix. And our desserts, put together beautifully."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant!  Staff was friendly and helpful -- This is the kind of place where they place the napkin in your lap!  We ordered the Canoe for Two, which consisted of two shrimp, two crispy spicy tuna rolls, two lobster potstickers, two Shanghai short ribs and two chicken katsu, all with their corresponding sauces.  This gave us an opportunity to try some of the different appetizers on the menu.  I ordered Roy's Trio (a trio of fish -- Hibachi Salmon, Macadamia-encrusted Ahi and Miso-Soy Butterfish) with asparagus and macadamia-pesto risotto.  The butterfish was my absolute favorite -- it didn't fall apart on the plate like some fish does, and it was cooked perfectly! My husband ordered the filet mignon with poblano mashed potatoes and asparagus.  His filet had a demi-glace that was divine.  The steak was cooked just as ordered and was a joy to eat.  We ordered cappucinos and we each ordered dessert -- I had the hot chocolate souffle (delectable!) and DH had the pineapple upside-down cake (delicious!).  Both were served with ice cream.  Our server was Melissa, and she did a fabulous job!"}
{"text":"I recently introduced my husband to Roy's. Although he loves my foodie ways, he is sometime skeptical of my higher priced adventures. Roy's is now his \"favorite restaurant in the whole wide world!\"    We flew into town late and drove over without reservations. No worries, we were still treated with absolute hospitality! I had some delicious Hawaiian Martinis, which I have not quite duplicated at home. We shared the canoe appetizer for two and the Auntie Lie's Aloha Roll. Both were so scrumptious. My favorites in the canoe were the Portabella Pot-stickers and Seared Ahi. I always order the Miso Butterfish, because I just love it so much.  The hubby ordered the Shellfish Sampler, which was even better! I kept stealing the risotto off of his plate! They gave us wonderful care and attention without bothering us on our romantic night. We did not have room for desert on this trip, but I do recommend the Chocolate Lava Cake, which must be ordered 20 minutes in advance. It is so...perfect.   I recommend Roy's for dates, or, If you are like me, just a nice meal out on your own. If you ever have any troubles, just speak to a manager. They will bend over backwards to give you and uncomplicated and excellent dining experience.   I am so very sad that the Scottsdale location closed, but happy that the Vegas location is doing well, so that I may visit!"}
{"text":"It was my first time dined in at Roy's.  I was recommended by a friend long time ago and finally decided to give it a try. We got there late (20 mins later than our reservation), but it was Tuesday so we didn't have any issue.  We got seated at the Bar area, underneath a flat screen TV.  Got to be honest, We were a bit dissapointed at first but after the Olimpics on, it actually helped us to get through the night.  The bartender was our server. So, besides making drinks for the restaurant, he had to wait on us.  He explained what was good to order.  I ended up ordering the Grand prix 3 course meal and my husband order something a la carte.... :) The flow was a bit slow.  We had to wait for the appetizers (Ahi tuna poke) for about 20-25 mins, but it was ok since we had TV to watch so basically we were watching TV while waiting for our food.  After the tuna poke, the salad was next (couldn't remember the name... it was something with pear on it). It was good but too much cheese. The dressing was good though.  Then, we waited for another 15 mins after we finished the salad for our entrees.  By the time, the entrees r served, I was full and needed space for the chocolate soufle. It was the highlight of this visit.  Although we had better soufle at the Morton steakhouse. After enjoying everything, we ran back to our hotel and \"deposit\" our money to the casino. It was a good experience, sufficient service, good food (not great), good ambiance, but that's just not enough to make us go there again.  Thanks for the experience Roy's."}
{"text":"They have steady traffic from the JW Marriott so the service is usually sub-par. No complaints about the food except the house salad had a really sour taste. They didn't offer to give us another salad. Won't be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Review for Restaurant Week 2011 menu:  Service started with a small bowl of edamame.  Another restaurant that does something than give you a bread basket.  Good idea.  Course 1:  Lobster pot stickers with miso butter sauce.  The pot stickers were grilled perfectly and the plating was nicely done.  I expected a stronger lobster flavor, but it is ground filling so maybe my expectations were too high.  They were very tasty.  Course 2:  Macadamia nut encrusted mahi mahi eith lobster essence.  The mahi mahi was tender and soft as it should be and it was moist and cooked perfectly.  There was a base of a small amount of potato puree that held some red potato slices on which the mahi mahi was placed.  It was crowned by asparagus spears.  A fine main course and just the right amount.  Course 3:  Melting hot chocolate soufflé with raspberry sauce and vanilla bean ice cream.  This isn't a traditional souffle, but it comes close to it.  The melted chocolate inside was very hot and you needed to wait for it to cool before really trying more than the tiniest taste.  Service:  Everyone was great!  When i was seated, I was in the dining room at a table meant for 4 people.  I had noticed the kitchen bar/sushi bar seating when I was going to my table.  I asked the hostess if I could sit there instead and she said, \"You can sit just about anywhere you want.  Come on.\"  I like restaurants that have a counter area that overlooks the cooks doing their thing.  I also had a good time talking with a couple of them and they showed me some of the dishes they had made before they were served because they noticed my inquisitive look at what they were doing.  This made the meal all the more enjoyable!  My server was there to ask how each course was after I had chance to try them, and he refilled my iced tea promptly.  Altogether, this was a wonderful dining experience.  I am sure I'll be returning to Roy's.  This RW menu gave me a good taste of their food and the whole experience showed me what they're like."}
{"text":"Started going there last summer and have been back 3 times since and every time we have had great food & service. They're Sushi is ok but they're unique fusion surf & turf meals are great. Go there for they're Aloha Hour and try the Wagyu burger with onion rings it comes with a tall beer, it is excellent!"}
{"text":"We came here with a couple friends to celebrate a birthday. We sat outside and our server was very nice and attentive. We ended up having the happy hour martinis ($7.00 for the Hawaiian - so delicious it's dangerous) and then we got some sushi rolls and lobster potstickers. Food and drinks were both great. Would definitely come back to check out their dinner specials!"}
{"text":"I would say it's quality food & very flavorful. You can tell it's been made by an experienced chef. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel that the  Happy Hour Pricing for food is almost the same as regular menu. It's just $2-$3 less than the regular price. Overall Happy Hour selection in food & drinks is pretty good. Server was knowledgeable & pleasant. If you want to try something unique & delicious, this is the place."}
{"text":"Definitely a gastronomic delight. Ciopino was a surprise, not much broth but lotsa flavor. Save room for the to~die~for chocolate souffle."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Roy;s for years and not just in Las Vegas. We were very disappointed in are food 10/29/2014. Not sure what is going on there but we have high expectations when dining at Roy's. Don't order the Shrimp-Lobster-Crab Cake it is awful. You can get a better Crab Cakes at your local grocery store. Lobster dry and no flavor. Shrimp was good. Are appetizers were so so. Lobster pot stickers and the Samoa's. They need to step up the quality."}
{"text":"Perfect evening at Roy's! It's always an amazing experience the staff is so friendly and wonderful at explaining the menu and answering questions. Food was incredible."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Roy's and have gone to the Chicago and Plano places. It's off the strip and this would be a great place to add to the strip. Went to this location just for the desserts. The pineapple upside down cake is one of my favorites. The service was great and the lighting was dim. I went Valentine's Day weekend and it wasn't too packed. The portions of the deserts were smaller than what I am use to, but they still had Great flavor."}
{"text":"Had a lovely meal here last night for my husband's bday. We enjoyed the $5 aloha happy hour at the bar. All of the drinks were fabulous. The lobster roll was good and fresh, but it was difficult to taste the lobster. The calamari was great, but the sauce was far too spicy for our tastes.  They had a special birthday message in the menu as well as chocolate bday wish on a small dessert plate of cookies and a picture of the two of us to commemorate the special occasion.  My Mahi was very good, although slightly dry. The husband's shellfish sampler was superb. The chocolate souffle was delicious! The restaurant made it a very special dinner."}
{"text":"Every dish in this restaurant is a delight to eat.  I came here with my BF and some friends for their New Year's Eve Prix Fix Menu.  For appetizers: - Pork belly: best I have ever tasted.  Texture of the meat was tender, and crisp on the outside, with not too much fat! - Sunrise Roll: yum! - Beef Tataki: yum!  For entrees: - Rib-Eye: perfectly cooked with a panang curry cream sauce; best idea ever! - Friends ordered the chicken and the prawn entrees and enjoyed them as well.  My ultimate favorite dessert is the Molten Chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.  Great to top off any meal!  Service was courteous.  The only thing is we didn't know it was a Prix Fix Menu when we called to make reservations.  Would have been nice to know what we were getting into!"}
{"text":"My wonderful friend is moving away so we have been trying to spend some time together so we went to Roy's.   They honored my YELP check-in offer (wow, what a concept-unlike Nittayas Secret Kitchen) and the Hawaiian Martini was fabulous!  I even ordered it as we were paying our bill and our waiter brought it right away.  He was great!  Very nice, genuine and offered friendly service. He made some excellent recommendations and was gracious  when I told him I didn't like one of the rolls he brought out.  He took it off our bill.  This was my first time at Roy's in Las Vegas, and they brought out some complimentary items for us to try (some edename and pork ribs-yummy).    I frequented Roy's in Scottsdale quite often so I didn't even open a menu.  The butterfish is always a favorite. I actually had butterfish for the first time in South Africa and it was prepared like its namesake.  When I saw it on Roy's menu and ordered it I knew it would be a marriage made in heaven and I've been ordering it every time I visit.  Tuna roll was very good but I skipped on dessert which is always the Lava cake, because after shopping at Zara's I decided to pass on the extra calories!"}
{"text":"Another amazing meal at Roys!  We were in Vegas for the weekend and decided to have an enjoyable meal Saturday night and popped in at Roy's with (yikes) no reservations.   The hostess was accommodating and seated us in a large booth in the bar area which was great since we were starving and ended up ordering a lot of food.   We ordered the shrimp appetizers with the Brussels sprouts and lobster pot-stickers which were both flawless.  I ordered the petite filet w/ the lobster and he ordered the 3 fish option which both of which were great.  For dessert I had the flourless chocolate cake and he had the pineapple upside down cake both of which were cooked to order.  AMAZING.  The staff was great and attentive.  Their description of the preparation was flawless and confident.  Loved it.  Oh and we had drinks too - the Hawaiian Martini and Mango Mojito were both favorites.    What puts Roy's above the rest is the service and consistent quality of the meals.  Where you go some places that have a great steak or an awesome dessert - here EVERYTHING is excellent.  Definitely go and try out their Aloha hour first if you are not sure which is an amazing deal.  Their menu changes often and apparently on Mondays you can get an appetizer and entree for $29!  If I lived in Vegas I would be here all the time!"}
{"text":"Normally, Roys is out of our budget but their happy hour makes great food available to everyone! $3 craft beer.... $7 cocktails along with a delicious Wagyu burger and super tastey ribs. Great food and great service. Early sat. Happy hour is a nice, quiet getaway!  Thx Roys!  5/18- another great happy hour meal at Roys! Ribs and burgers!!   Great  staff and service as well !  Top notch !!"}
{"text":"I want to begin by saying I love Roy's I have been to Roy's in pretty much every location.  Tonight I am in the Chandler AZ location. I made reservations yesterday after receiving a complimentary lobster email from Roy's.  The restaurant was freezing, the patio was fully occupied and were seated in a dark corner of the restaurant.  The host knocked over all of the glasses  The server argued about the lobster special until I showed him the email.  His defense was he had been off for a few days.  What happened to the customer is always right?! Roy's dining experience use to be special.  Roy needs to come train the staff or get new people who have a passion to serve."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by this place one night for dinner and while the staff seamed hesitant about seating us, even though it wasn't busy (maybe it was because I was in shorts?) they finally put us outside and we had a great time. The staff eventually warmed up to us and the food was excellent. We ended up finishing two bottles of wine that night and talked about coming back again, though we never did."}
{"text":"Had Roy's trio! So delish! THe only reason I did not give them 5 stars was because they took forever to take your drinks and food order.  However, the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went to Roy's this afternoon mid afternoon on a Sunday to use a gift certificate I got for directing a bell choir. It was a hefty gift card ($75) so I thought it would go a long way. Well, it barely covered our meal, which was during the time they called \"brunch\" that I was thinking would be like a brunch buffet. No, you had to order off a very limited menu, but the items on it were very good. Luckily they were able to accommodate hubby with a special vegetarian menu. I had a delicious mimosa (champagne and orange juice, I gather? Sorry, not a drink I'm terribly familiar with), they refilled hubby's soft drink before he even asked, I had the lobster omelette and hubby had some stir-fry dish with rice, veggies and tofu. We split a lime tart. I think it's a great, beautifully appointed place if you want to really dress up and go all spendy for a wedding anniversary or the like, but it's not exactly casual dining. Great for a once-a-year celebration spot."}
{"text":"Roy's is conveniently located within the JW Marriott, right outside the pool area. A few of us went to happy hour here after spending the day at a conference. There was live music that Friday night, and the weather was perfect for sitting outside on the patio. We took advantage of the sushi and drink specials- $6 drinks and apps! The Big Island Ebi Roll was pretty good and not too spicy, while the drinks were nice and strong.   Great way to end a long day of sitting at a conference!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOOOOOOVE this place!!! ESPECIALLY Happy Hour!!!! Well, I'm a fan of ALL happy hours, but definitely GREAT ones!  The HH menu isn't the biggest but it has some good eats on it. I love the \"house\" martini, i.e. \"Roy's Special\" and it has been a perfect end to a couple of not-so-great work days.  The staff is nice and very attentive. The atmosphere is a little more quiet that I sometimes like...I don't even recall IF they play music at all (uh oh)...but that's probably because my friends and I are probably too busy munching to notice.  I've only eaten off of the regular menu once and I chose a steak (pretty hard to go wrong there) so *shrug*   They get my vote for being a nice pitstop on the way home from work. See ya there! ;)"}
{"text":"This was a nice restaurant but the portions and pricing were way out of line for what they provided. The food quality and service was good. I was not impressed based upon the prices we paid for drinks and food. The best deal was the price fixed three course meal and dessert was excellent."}
{"text":"My wife and I, along with two other couples, went to Roy's this evening.  To say it was a disappointment would be an understatement.  My wife ordered Roy's Trio.  She substituted out the butterfish for a double portion of the ahi since she cannot eat soy products.  I ordered the tasting menu.    Starting with my order, the amuse bouche of halibut was at best OK. The presentation was acceptable and the fish seemed to be reasonably fresh.  The sauce though, overpowered the fish.  The first course of wagyu beef carpaccio was poor. The meat was not tender and was sliced too thick.  Basically, it looked like a dish you would get at an inexpensive catered wedding.  I'm not sure how they accomplished this, but dinner went down hill from there.  The proscuitto wrapped prawns were simply terrible. They were way overcooked and extremely salty.  When I asked the waitress  whether the shrimp should be very well done, she stated (to my utter disbelief) that it was necessary in order to get the proscuitto crispy (just silly).  I'd bet that they prepped the dish and pre-cooked it without realizing that the shrimp would continue to cook after it was taken off the heat.  The cherry on top of this disaster was the dessert.  It was a molasses and macadamia nut tort with vanilla ice cream.  The entire table thought it looked terrible and the taste lived up to its appearance. The crust was dry and the filling was nearly inedible.  Even worse, I've had better ice cream from the generic section of the supermarket.  Overall, it was basically a rubber chicken dinner.  My wife's dinner didn't fair much better.  Her fresh greens salad wouldn't survive a rabbit's pallet. It was basically some mixed lettuce, a cherry tomato, some cuke's and one piece of carrot.  I'm pretty sure a supermarket salad would be better. When they first brought out the Roy's Trio, the salmon was so dry and overcooked, it was obvious without even tasting it.  How this made it out of the kitchen was beyond me.  The rest of the fish was properly prepared but completely uninspiring.    Roy's describes itself as high end Hawaiian fusion dining.  While there were a few hints of Hawaii, the 'high end' was nowhere to be found.  There are many fine dining restaurants in the Phoenix metro and Roy's is not among them.  Frankly, for the money, I can think of at least a dozen restaurants that stand head and shoulders above Roy's.  Perhaps we hit Roy's on a bad night, but I wouldn't return to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"We went for my husbands birthday, and they did not disappoint. We came in and it was aloha hour so we got a tempura roll and martinis. The drinks were great, and the roll was amazing. When we sat down they had inserts in the menu saying happy birthday to my husband. The server was amazing. She was knowledgeable about the menu and the ingredients.  And they ended the meal with a happy birthday coconut cake. This is a definitely a place to go, special occasion or not. We will be back on our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Great place to spend an anniversary! They really treat you well. The service was top notch. Fried Calamari was excellent with the spicy sauce. I had the Fillet which was great. My wife had the Butterfish and loved it. The Hawaiian martinis are delicious. Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Here's what you get for not listening to the bartender:  Instead of getting the butterfish, you get the Roy's Trio instead just to, you know, hedge your bets.  Never again.  The butterfish is the way to go, even if you're like me, fellow ginger hater (yes, I am the one Chinese person in the world who hates both ginger and spicy foods).  I started off with a mango mojito, which was absolutely delicious but also absolutely devoid of any kind of a kick.  For appetizers, we got the Lakanilau roll, the calamari and the blackened ahi.  For somebody who loves raw fish, I was at first a little disappointed we weren't getting actually maki, but oh good golly, that roll was CRAZY GOOD.  Order it.  You won't be disappointed.  And then my trio came out.  In case you can't tell from the intro, the butterfish was by far the best of the three.  Don't get me wrong, the others were also delicious, but it doesn't hold a candle to the star -- rich, flavorful, the way that fish is meant to be cooked.  The portions were a mite small when divided into three dishes, so I definitely would recommend getting just one plate.  Last time I got the Shellfish Sampler, which also was a trio but had bigger portion sizes.  We got talked into getting dessert.  I had a small bite of the chocolate souffle, which was one of the best I've ever had.  And given the many choices that Vegas has to offer, I have to say that Roy's is reasonably priced for the quality of the cuisine.  Very happy and can't wait to try the Chicago location."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon to try this place out and so glad we did.  We will definitely be back.  Very good food and great service."}
{"text":"I had seen all the good reviews on Yelp so I expected a good meal at Roy's but I was still pleased at how good the food actually was.  The boyfriend and i hit up Roy's on a Friday night. We didn't have reservations so we were offered a table in the bar. The bar isn't very big but it was full so it was pretty loud. The noise was a tad distracting so I might try the dining room next time.  But other than that we had a nice time. I ordered a Mai Tai to drink and the Macadamia Nut Mahi Mahi for my entree. Boyfriend ordered the filet. The Mai Tai was yummy and rummy. Although a bit on the pricey side - $12. I did not order a second. My Mahi Mahi was served with new potatoes and gravy and asparagus. The fish was done perfectly and had a great texture and flavor. The potatoes were nice and tender and the asparagus was good too. The portion of the fish was quite large. Boyfriend's filet was tasty as well. Slightly more done than he likes it but not overdone. The steak comes with mashed potatoes (with bacon!) and broccoli. He did not hesitate in cleaning his plate.  For desert we ordered the chocolate lava cake. Maybe I was just too full but I found this to be a little underwhelming. The ice cream was more like frozen yogurt and while the cake was full of oozing chocolate it just didn't have that decadent chocolate taste I was hoping for.  Overall I was very happy with my night at Roy's. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Roy's and it was incredible!  Greatest service and delicious food. It's what I expected. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Worth the $$. They messed up our order and Immediately fixed it! The customer service here is awesome and they really accommodate their customers. The surf and turf will bring anyone back for seconds. I like Fleming's but this price is a little better and I like the customer service better. They also make you feel comfortable and it doesn't seem as \"uppity\".worth a shot if you like steak!"}
{"text":"Not the first time at Roy's and both times we had a great experience. Last night was my friend's birthday and the staff was very kind and welcoming. A note was on the table when we got there and the night ended with a group picture, and a small cake. The staff here is amazing and would be the reason why I'd come here again, and have. I ordered the Dynamite lump crab crusted barramundi. The fist was done right, I enjoyed the taste and the sides of bok choy and the carrot. One thing I wanted to highlight was the sauce, while it was tasty, there was way to much of it, that it overpowered the taste of the fish. I would have loved it more if there was less sauce.   Thanks again to everyone there our experience was amazing. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We had a pleasant time for Aloha here on Monday so we  attempted to have dinner here on Christmas eve.   The maitre d said we would be seated in 15 minutes or less. We waited a good 25 minutes before she informed us the table had not been setup yet and she could only seat us outside or wait longer.   OMG! Sorry young lady, located  at the JW Marriott which has several dinning options we got up and walked out! Maybe this is one of reasons why they have closed down the Scottsdale location!"}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. I was stuck in traffic due to construction on Flamingo Blvd and thought its been a while since I dined at Roys. I pulled into the private parking lot verses fighting traffic.  Being I was solo so I opted to dine in the  comfy bar area. Iwas greeted by the friendly waitress who took my beer order and I started off with the appetizer - ebi roll, followed by the wagyu burger. The roll was a generous size and the burger was topped with an sunny side up egg, mushrooms and the most delicious onion rings I've tasted. For dessert I couldn't pass  on the pineapple upside down cake which included coconut ice cream.  Overall, a superb dining experience that was reasonably priced with solid service."}
{"text":"Great food, I had the swordfish (Roy's speciality), perfectly cooked and the sauce was great!! I do not give a fifth star because:  1. They do not have a good beer selection  2. The ambiance could be better (cheap materials and smells fish all around)  But it is a great spot for a nice dinner!"}
{"text":"We went to Roy's on the advice of a friend and were impressed! The Kobe beef sushi appetizer was \"melt-in-your-mouth\" amazing and the Mai Tais were yummy!   Hard to believe that this is a chain!  The cuisine was not \"vanilla\" and service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"I was taken here last weekend for a date night, first date at that.    It was a good atmosphere, not too quiet, yet not too loud.  If you love Japanese Hawaiian fusion then Roy's is your place!   Delicious seafood options and top-notch bartenders make this place a must. Overly friendly staff that is there to accommodate your every need.  There will be a date #2."}
{"text":"I went here on January 22, 2013 and it was extremely quiet for a holiday night. The servers were all friendly. And I also checked in on yelp and got a free martini for doing so. So be sure to check in maybe you'll get a free Hawaiian martini too!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.  In other words, food is good, but you're paying high prices for the privilege. I wasn't blown away by the food, it was good...but I must admit I've had better at some of Roy Yamaguchi's other locations (in Hawaii in California).  The mai tai was just as good at the Chandler location as it was in Hawaii though, so bonus points for that!"}
{"text":"We heard many good things about this place in Phoenix Mag.  I called to make a reservation for our anniversary.  I think we'd have been fine on a Wednesday but they asked if it was for a special occasion and greeted us with Happy Anniversary from the get and repeated it numerous times throughout our experience.  They even had a little Happy Anniversary card on the table and gave us a free desert (Key Lime) with it written on the plate.  It was awesome by the way.  We ordered the canoe for two and the Poke Bowl along with the pineapple upside down cake and we loved it all tremendously.  My favorite was probably the Tuna Roll on the canoe for two and the Tuna in the Poke Bowl.  Trust me it was all delicious but the Tuna had a great spice to it we loved.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent visit.  The only reason I am dinging them one star is because they don't serve the three course dinner on Saturdays.  We all started with the ceasar salad.  My wife had the filet and lobster tail, her cousin and I ordered the short rib dinner.  We finished with a chocolate souffle and the pineapple upside down cake desserts.  We enjoyed our meal and our our conversations.  Would get a fifth star if the three course dinner was on the menu."}
{"text":"We came  here with two other couples. Got two of the appetizer combos. In the combo, the ribs and shrimp were phenomenal, the sushi roll was good and the pot sticker and chicken tempura satay were ok. Next time will just order shrimp and rib appetizer. For mains we had lamb chops, mahi, short ribs and surf and turf. Best was the lamb with risotto and short ribs. Everything else was very good except mahi which was average. For desert we had the chocolate soufle which was another winner. I think it was a good value for the service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Very well decorated place, with lots of good Hawain food selections. The ambiance is very friendly, and the well it's Las Vegas..:)  I have no much comments about this restaurant except, you should give it a try when going to Vegas. The price is right, portion of plate is right, crabcake is Yummy..  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"We ate here last Thursday and all I can say is the service was excellent.  Food is a little pricey but tastes good.  I ordered the Winter 3 course menu. I had the clam and mussels appetizer,  trout for main course and the chocolate souffle for dessert. My husband had the hangar steak special and  my daughter had the roy's trio of seafood.  My husband's only complaint is that it's a little salty for his taste.  Overall,  it was a good dinner. They gave us one free dessert and 3 pcs of dumplings."}
{"text":"I received your solicitation for the Cooking Class on Saturday 2/11/2017.  I signed my wife and sister in-law up for the class.  Based on your words in your ad, I told them that they will actually be involved in preparing the meal.  Here are your words \"for an exclusive HANDS-ON cooking class.\"   I was shocked when my wife called a few minutes ago and told me that they did not have any \"HANDS ON\". I have frequented Roy's numerous times over the past 20+ years at various locations and shocked about this misrepresentation"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable - fish was awsume   Service solid   Manager was polite and on top of his game   Enjoyed this location three times while at the Gartner SCM conference late May 2017  We will be back"}
{"text":"The ahi tuna & avocado salad was an amazing starter. The addition of the seaweed and cucumber made for a nice crunch with the softness of the tuna.  For mains, the filet mignon was delicious with a small garnish of vegetables & mash. The Asian style pork chop was huge, cooked so the meat was slightly pink and juicy. For dessert they had a special upside down pineapple cake which you have to order at the same time as your main & came with coconut ice cream. It was sweet without being overly so. The homemade ice creams were excellent and mix of flavours you haven't tried before (the Hawaiian 'passion fruit' with coconut sorbet was amazing)! Overall and excellent meal with prompt and friendly service."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Nothing you'd expect from a chain.   Went during a business trip, was floored by service and quality."}
{"text":"Walked from my hotel on the strip to Roy's - sketchhh. My paranoia kicked in and I freaked out a little over the man seemingly \"following\" us the entire time, until I remembered it's just one long road.   Anyway, onto the restaurant. My first impression upon walking in was great. An employee opened the door for us (valet parking? even though there barely a crowd). The hostess was very friendly, greeted us, and sat us down at our table, even putting our napkins in our laps - every detail counts! I was pleased with this small act of good service, as some nicer restaurants I've been to in Manhattan never did this for me.   After that the service was a little off, but only if I'm being incredibly picky. Somehow our server never got a chance to come over to our table until we wanted the check. It was another server/busboy? who took our order, and I don't even remember if someone checked up on us. However, just giving the benefit of the doubt, our server seemed busy? walking back and forth, although the restaurant was quite empty, really. I think he sensed that we weren't as happy, so when I tried to clean up my mess on the table, he stopped me and told me that was his job and that we were to just relax. So I'll give him points back for that ;)   I was really excited for the food after reading Yelp reviews, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. I ordered the mahi mahi to much regret. It was horribly plain, but thankfully the lobster cream sauce was just fantastic and saved the dish (a little). My boyfriend ordered the Trio, and GOD I wish I ordered the butterfish like they suggested! It was absolutely amazing.   We were joking that my boyfriend's little brother got the best deal. He ordered the rib eye (?) off the kids' menu, and I believe it came with an appetizer and dessert (unless we misunderstood), for only ~$12! Our entrees were almost double the price but I felt like I could have been equally filled with his dish(es), haha!   This place wasn't toooo bad, but it didn't meet my expectations. I really think we got unlucky with everything - perhaps ordering the wrong thing on the menu, and not getting a chance to fully experience the great service everyone speaks of on Yelp."}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter while on spring break.  This was the place we chose for our one expensive meal,  and yes, I did set a new personal record for my most expensive meal!  Absolutely no complaints though.  Everything was outstanding from the mment we walked in the door.  Everyone was so nice and professional.  I'm not going to go into all the details of our food, but it was all great.  Probably the best service I have ever had and I plan to go back when in town with my wife.  I do recommend making reservations, as we did and got right in. One last thing that blew me away, yesterday in the mail I got a thank you card from Thomas our main waiter, hand written and included a sushi appetizer for our next trip!  I have never experienced that before!  Totally unexpected.  You can't go wrong with Roy's!"}
{"text":"Restaurants like Roy's make me wish Yelp had a 10 star system so we could really separate the men from the boys.  People have already raved about this place, but let me tell you some unique things that push it over the top: 1.  My girlfriend's birthday: they printed her name and a birthday message on the inside of ALL of our menus! 2.  The Butter Fish 3.  The Butter Fish 4.  The 36.99 Prix Fixe summer menu (a STEAL at a restaurant like this) 5.  My parents both had special requests, not on the menu, which were immediately fulfilled  To the entire staff, THANK YOU.  This is a lifetime top 5 dining experience for me.  BY FAR the best restaurant in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Roy's sent out a promotional email with a $25 off coupon, so my husband and I went for our anniversary.    The food here just isn't as good as it is in the Roy's locations in Hawaii. I thought I might have been too picky the first time we visited this location a few months ago, or perhaps the kitchen was having an off-night, but our food this time around was even worse:   Hawaii Kai Style Beef Short Ribs: should have been savory and melt in your mouth. It was just ok. It was much better prepared on our last visit.  Side dish of Szechuan string beans: I  was appalled. It was a pile of steamed green beans -- that's it. When I asked the server, he checked with the kitchen and said they had sauteed the green beans in the Szechuan sauce. It clearly wasn't, but I asked if I could have some of the sauce on the side, so he brought some. The sauce was ok, but not really Szechuan. From what I could see it was just shoyu and chilipaste. Was pretty miffed I had to even pay for this.  Alaea Salt Crusted Bone in Ribeye - My husband ordered this. It was fine for a steak, but nothing great. The biggest disappointment was the Truffled bacon mac n cheese! It had zilch seasoning, had very little cheese sauce, and there was hardly any bacon. I'm someone who can get by without much seasoning, unlike Ryan who wants 10lbs of salt on everything, but even I thought it was waaaaay underseasoned.   Raspberry Chocolate Lava Cake (forget the actual name on menu): The last time I was here, I commented that it was a bit chewy. I was hoping for a better one this time, but it was even worse. There was not much oozing of chocolate goodness unfortunately, and the cake was even harder/chewier than last time.  I think if you've never been to Roy's in Hawaii, the food is fine and you'll enjoy your meal here. But if you have been to Roy's in Hawaii, it will be a letdown. There is just no comparison!"}
{"text":"Customer Service = 5 out of 5 stars Cleanliness = 5 out of 5 stars Quality of Food = 5 out of 5 stars  First time experience was fantastic.  The bartender gave excellent recommendations and the food was definitely fusion inspired for sure.   In addition the dessert was top notch - I am not a big fan, but the suffle.  Thank you to Roy's staff for a 5 star experience.  -Todd Customer on 3/13/2011"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband, and SO glad we did! The night started out with some deliciously spicy edamame! Our server, Cody, was one of the most attentive we have ever had. He told us he was new, but you would never believe it. We ordered a sushi roll- I can't remember the exact name- but it was so tasty, and fairly inexpensive. When it came time for out main entrees, we were so pleased with our choices. I ordered the Filet Mignon, which came with a bernaise sauce, grilled asparagus, and cheesy mashed potatoes. YUM! My husband had the butterfish with forbidden rice. So delicious, melt in your mouth, sweet, absolutely perfect. We normally don't order dessert, but we splurged and ordered the pineapple upside down cake. It came with a side of homemade coconut ice cream. My hubby is normally repulsed by all things coconut, but he devoured it! Truly one of the best date nights we ever went on. The service, from the host to our server to the front of house manager, was all stellar. We will without a doubt come back here in the near future."}
{"text":"This review is just based on their Happy Hour! I've been here for dinner and I think that it's pretty marvelous, but that's for some other day.   Everything on the Happy Hour menu is $5! They have some good food items, Wagyu Sliders, Calamari and the Potstickers were my favorite. Hard alcohol is not $5 unless you get something that is a Roy's specialty cocktail. The Strawberry Basil Martini is definitely the drink to drink if you are like me that likes something sweet but not too sweet. It is definitely marvelous!   Service was good, they have the patio and sushi bar for Happy Hour open too, so that way there's a whole bunch of Happy Hour tables.   I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week. Never been here before and wanted to try something new. Wow....blew my socks off, for sure. So...the boyfriend and I headed out to this very posh place. The waiters were very attentive...like putting a napkin on my lap, refreshing water practically after each sip, walking me to the restroom, clearing plates as soon as we were done...like that. So we had lobster pot-stickers to start out with. It had a butter demi-glaze sauce (I believe) that had a spice to it and i don't think I can have any pot-sticker ever again that will be as good as this. These were so good! Second course I got filet mignon and the boyfriend had short ribs. Both excellent, cooked to perfection and came with buttery mashed potatoes, brocolini and small carrots. Seriously...the potatoes were amazing. I kept dipping the veggies in it to enhance their flavor.  Dessert choice was a chocolate souffle for me and a cheesecake with blueberry sauce for the boyfriend. All in all, best service, best food and wonderful experience that I've ever had. Need to try this place again....the pot-stickers alone make it worth while."}
{"text":"take your girlfriend here and she'll love you forever..hehe  the kobe beef sushi is awesome!! lava cake thingy supper good:] we got the prix-fixe menu so we got an appetizer/salad, main course, and their lava cake . and if its your birthday they greet you like a hundred times and your menu could be personalized:] mine was;D  everything was yum, great presentation, outstanding service, but take in mind that they charge at fine dining prices."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and amazing service!! Bartenders know their drinks and know the menu. I would recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd Roy's location that I've been to. My husband and I visited for our anniversary and enjoyed the experience overall.   Our waitress was so nice and very informative about the menu. My husband and I normally don't drink when we go out to eat but he decided to go ahead and order a beer. He asked for a \"Dos Equis\" and they let him know that they didn't carry that brand. He decided to go for his other favorite beer, Blue Moon, which they did carry. Sadly, the beer never came. Our waitress must have forgotten. The group that she was serving next to us was ordering so many drinks and so many menu items so she might have felt the tip over there was going to be higher and proceed to neglect us a little bit. Not a big deal.   The food was really good and we, of course, ordered the chocolate souffle. Unfortunately, when I cut into the souffle, the chocolate didn't ooze out like it normally does. It was certainly over-baked. Again, not a huge deal as I've had it in the past and it's always been incredible. I'm sure it was just a fluke.   Could our service and experience been better? I think so. Will be go back? Certainly!"}
{"text":"Roys is an upper end restaurant located a few blocks east of the strip on Flamingo. It has valet parking as well as self parking and was easy to find. We made reservations for 5pm on a friday night and were able to be seated immediately upon our arrival. The first thing I noticed was that all the tables had white table clothes and wine glasses, and the clientelle was mostly older, mature couples that were obviously very well heeled. I should also point out that the dress for this restaurant, based upon the patrons I saw present and already seated, is business casual, meaning slacks and open collar long sleeved shirts for the gentlemen and pant suits or dresses for the ladies. We started dinner with two cocktails and appetizers consisting of a shrimp plate (4 Large jumbo Shrimp) in a szechuan style clear dipping sauce and a green salad with shaved pear slices, macadamia nuts in a vinaigrette dressing. The salad and shrimp were both excellent. The husband ordered a combination Filet mignon with shrimp and garlic mashed potatoes while I ordered the Roys Trio plate. The Trio plate contained 3 pieces of fish, each weighing about 2 ounces each. The Grilled Salmon, Mosoyaki Butter fish and Macademia nut encrusted Mahi Mahi were served on a rectangular plate with individual sections for each entree. In addition we also ordered a side dish of the truffled bacon mac n cheese. The fish was cooked exactly as requested, medium rare salmon and medium rare to medium Mahi Mahi & Butter fish. The fish was all very good and I enjoyed them very much, but I didn't think the serving sizes were adequate as I was still hungry after finishing them. I tried to fill up on the bacon mac n cheese which was also very good and some of the husband's mashed potatoes and filet mignon. The filet mignon was served medium rare and just literally melted in your mouth. The garlic mashed potatoes were exactly what I expected both in texture and flavor. Good but nothing to get excited about. We finished our meal with a desert with a piece of hot pineapple upside down cake and a dollop of vanilla ice cream. The cake was excellent, and just as advertised by the waitress who recommended it to us. Next time we'll be here, we are certainly going to try the chocolate soufflé. The service by all, waiter, waitress, bar tender and hostess were more then I ever expected, and they were very attentive without being annoying with their presence in the process. In short the service was just excellent. The food is also excellent, both in the menu items offered and the way each item is prepared and served; that said it is also very, very pricey. The above item for both of us came to more then $168.00 and when a 20% tip is added my bill was right at $200.00. It was a nice restaurant to try but I won't be going back anytime soon, as I can find just as good a meal elsewhere for a lot less money."}
{"text":"This review is for the Valentine's four course meal.  Service was phenomenal... food was good but the entrees were not as spectacular as I expected.  I actually had ordered the scallops which were terrible and they gladly switched out my food. My wife's filet mignon was amazing.  Dont get me wrong, good foor but not $100 per person good..."}
{"text":"Shellfish Trio = the bomb diggidy! Try the lavender ice cream & the Canoe appetizer :)p"}
{"text":"Although Roys are everywhere, I never had an opportunity to go until recently when we were vacationing in Arizona.   I love this place!  When we arrived, we were early enough to catch the tail end of happy hour which means that for $5.00 each, I got to try the Hawaiian martini, lobster potstickers, and cucumber and cilantro martini.  Everything was so damn good!  Once we sat down, we received edamame, compliments of the chef.  I wasn't a huge fan of the seasoning on it.  I kind of prefer rock salt.  I ordered the surf and turf for dinner.  Again, it was amazing, although the lobster was lobster claws, not a tail, which was kind of disappointing.  For desert, we ordered the molten lava cake, which was phenomenal.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great time and amazing family dinner last night (Christmas Eve) at Roy's.  Service was fantastic - drinks were served or refilled quickly and they all tasted good, especially the Hawaiian Martini.  Our family of 9 ordered some appetizers (highly recommend the ebi roll) & a cross section of the menu for main courses.  Filets were cooked to perfection; osso buco was extremely flavorful; braised short ribs were so tender you could cut them with a fork; scallops seared to perfection - everything was OUTSTANDING.  Topped the dinner off with a chocolate souflee.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the quality of our dinner here. A co-worker and I gabbed dinner here the first night of our convention. We split the lobster pot stickers and they were pretty good. The grilled Caesar salad was excellent. I ordered the halibut and scallops combo and it was one of the best main courses I have had in awhile when it comes to seafood. Decent wine selection as well. We split upside pineapple cake it it was just ok. Overall a great dining experience."}
{"text":"There are few things in the world that excite me more than going to Roy's for dinner.  Where to start! Roy's has this spectacular way of taking everyone's favourites and turning into edible art. They take their food very seriously and that message is strong the minute you step into the door. The service is always impeccable and prompt, the food is well thought and plated to perfection and the flavours are definitely something to write home about. I recommend the prix-fixe at $34.95 as it includes a little bit of everything for such a great value. If you ever read a review and listen to it- let it be this one you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best meals and best service we have had in a very long time. Shawn was a top notch server who was attentive, knowledgeable, and engaging.  We had drinks during happy hour (excellent bartender) then in to dinner with wife and son. Order the combination appetizer-very good. Then we had three different meals; all three were top notch. Desert and coffee topped off the perfect evening. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Apparently I am not getting this place. The service was eh (my younger friend and I didn't look like we were flashing dough I guess, despite a large bill) and really, I've had better food MUCH MUCH cheaper elsewhere.  My friend and I went there recently. We had a giftcard and she heard it was a great place. It was gorgeous, I'll give it that. The prices are outrageous for the portions. It is very arty and portions were tiny. I am a small person who doesn't eat alot, but I left hungry after a $30+ dinner!!!  I had the scallops, which were good, but there were literally 5 scallops, 2 TINY breaded mushrooms and a cake of rice, about the size of a half deck of cards. WTF?  The only thing appealing about dinner was the basil strawberry margarita.   Sorry, I just can't recommend that you come to this place, unless you love spending tons of money on tiny portions!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Roy's for their \"Aloha (Happy) Hour\"...and boy we were sooooo happy we did! We had been there for dinner before but it was a nice change :)   First off the bartender, Matt, was super personable and greeted us right away.  My husband and I don't eat meat, but we LOVE fish - so we ordered 1 of each of the fish appetizers served during Aloha hour...  1) Mahi Fish Taco - Super fresh and a nice crunch...oh and the jalapeno sauce -YUM! 2) Lobster Potstickers - also very nice...wish there were more than 3 per portion 3) Ahi tuna roll - Definitely our favorite of the four! One of the best sushi rolls i've ever had 4) Ebi Roll - close second to the ahi roll...the addition of mango  really elevated this \"shrimp tempora\" roll to a new level  We finished it off with the lemon cheesecake - so refreshing!  We definitely recommend Roy's for dinner or Aloha hour!"}
{"text":"What a perfect place for a date the customer service is outstanding. The food is fantastic and everything about this place screams the perfect date. Every time I come to Roy's I am always impressed."}
{"text":"We went last night for an anniversary, our first visit to Roy's.  We made reservations in advance and it was nice to be greeted with a \"Happy Anniversary,\" along with a menu message.  Our waitress was very good. She answered our menu questions and obviously knew the menu.  We started with the lobster potstickers (recommend).  I ordered a Hawaiian martini; husband ordered the Maui Mule.  Wished I had ordered the Maui Mule.  Salads were excellent, perfect sizes and tasty.  I ordered the fish trio, which was just the right-sized portions of the butterfish (highly recommend), mahi mahi (tasty) and salmon (so-so).  Husband ordered the swordfish (so-so) and wished he had ordered the butterfish.   We did order the soufflé; however, if we'd known we'd be getting a complimentary brownie for our anniversary (delish!), we'd probably wouldn't have ordered the soufflé.  All in all, a nice dining experience.  Our feedback:  Music: The music was too loud and not very classy.  Had a Denny's Restaurant feel.  Was expecting a classier décor.  Servers: As soon as we finished a final bite, the servers swooped in and removed our plates, making us feel rushed.  They even swooped away our desert plates and utensils, leaving us to use our fingers for the complimentary brownies. Not cool.  Food and cocktails were tasty. We'd go back."}
{"text":"I'm not being bias because I use to work there, but I think Roy's is a great concpet with good value.  I love the Miso glaze butterifish among other dishes.  There's always something new on the menu so give  Roy's a try and if you dont like it, it's  on me."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her birthday dinner and it was great. We started with the lobster potstickers, then we had the lobster roll, next we had Maui wowie salad awesome. For our entrees my wife had the Shellfish sampler and I had the filet and lobster combo. Both were delightful. For dessert we had the flourless souffle cake and the restaurant threw in a key lime dessert for my wife's birthday. Finally Stephanie was awesome. She started the evening with a birthday card and finished the evening with a picture that we took home. First class. The only one thing I would improve is  the wine list did not offer any really good Bordeaux choices and we were in the bar under the TV. Finally the restaurant threw in a gift card for our next meal."}
{"text":"The food was excellent I ordered the filet mignon it was perfect !  Although dessert they kinda flopped on !  The facility is clean and bathrooms well maintained!  Great place to go for a nice evening out !   Attire is semi dressy and the meats are always perfectly prepared! Although they do offer a lot of seafood and sushi we opt for the Steaks and meats!  Although friends of ours rave about the seafood their so I bet it's a great meal as well !   Our waitress on the other hand was just okay !  As it got busier she seemed to stop by less and less I had an empty glass sitting in front of me for some time ! That's one thing that drives me nuts . Just fill my glass before its empty especially if it's just a simple glass of soda ! I would have tipped her a lot more then I did if she didn't have a waiter in trading or what seemed to be the buss boy offer us dessert and such ! So besides her dropping the ball a little bit with consistent waitressing it was all wonderful and worth every penny !   Thank you for a wonderful night out !!!"}

{"text":"Having lived in Vegas for just 6 months, we are still exploring the non-strip restaurants. This time we hit gold.  A previous review said this was a cookie cutter chain. It maybe. I did not explore their corporate structure but it in no way feels like it. We went to the happy hour and did a couple of appetizers and the Hawaiian Martinis. Tip - if you check into Yelp while you are there you get a FREE Hawaiian Martini!  On Monday's they feature a three course meal for $36.95. Appetizer, main course and desert. You can choose from almost any item on the menu to build your meal. If you are a calamari fan, DO NOT MISS the calamari appetizer. We all had Butter Fish as the main course and it was amazing. My favorite of the desserts was the pineapple upside down cake.  Our server was Dan. We gave him the task of choosing what appetizers and desserts to bring. He was spot on. If I owned a restaurant, I would try and steal him away. He was very attentive and helpful.  This is my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"They have an ahola hour it's decent but still a little pricey. Lobster pot stickers are a must wagyu burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had. Our waiter Zane suggested it when I gave him my 2 choices. I also got the pineapple upside down cake for my birthday and it was crispy and not too sweet. I do think they are completely overpriced and wouldnt go unless on aloha hour"}
{"text":"Just had a terrible experience at Roy's Las Vegas on Flamingo. Entered the parking lot at my reservation time to find no open parking spaces. I pulled up to the door and asked valet where I was to park as all the lot was full except those coned off for valet. They told me unless I let them park my car I was pretty much out of luck. I pulled up to the door, went inside and asked the Managing Partner (Rodney Johnson) about parking. The ensuing ten minute conversation revealed that Roy's management is subservient to the contract parking valet and restaurant management cannot override the valet decision. I asked him if it made good business sense to turn away a regular customer (a customer that hosted his son's $3500. wedding party at Roy's) over parking. He said they were saving the twenty open spaces for those that may come later and want valet. So it is Roy's business model to save spaces for those diners you hope will come later and might want valet while turning away someone that is already here and ready to be seated. He reminded me that valet is complimentary. I told him I would not let a kid that looked like he should be home studying his Jr. High math homework drive my Corvette. I ultimately left telling him that it just doesn't seem good business to turn away a $150 check so the valet boys MIGHT later get a $5.00 tip. Not hard to understand why the other Las Vegas location recently boarded its doors and took down the torches."}
{"text":"This happy hour is like a two hour trip to Hawaii. At a $6 price point for island infused cocktails, mahi-mahi taco's and bbq pulled pork, arrive on an empty stomach. I have dreams about their pineapple martini's. Their sushi rolls are reason enough to veer off of the strip."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Roy's on 8/13. I must say overall it was disappointing and not up to the standard we have had at other Roy's. The Caesars salad was wilted and somewhat brown. The filet was over cooked and had consistency of a much cheaper cut of beef. The waiter was good and knowledgable. The butterfish was prepared well but just average in my opinion. The only reason for 2 versus 1 star was the soufflé which was excellent."}
{"text":"I really wanted to LOVE Roy's, but it just didn't do it for me.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either.  I left feeling very \"meh.\"  My husband and I were staying at the JW with a Travelzoo deal, and we had been wanting to try Roy's since we live very close anyway, but never had the chance.  So we figured why not.  We were greeted and seated right on time in a very private booth indoors.  The weather was nice enough to sit outside, but everyone was outside and we wanted a more romantic dinner rather than having to listen to everyone else's conversations and screaming kids.    Our server was really great - knowledgeable, attentive but not overbearing, and I wish I could remember his name.  We started with our drinks...my husband ordered his typical Jack and Diet and I ordered a glass of wine.  I wasn't impressed with the wine menu, however, as I was trying to decide between two different glasses, our server brought me tastes of both options, which was a really nice touch.    We had the lobster potstickers for an appetizer, which I really enjoyed.  However, as others have mentioned, the portions are very small for what you are paying.  I rolled my eyes at those reviews before I dined here, but having experienced it now, I can confirm that really, they are small.  It wouldn't have bothered me if I paid $15 for 3 bites and those bites were the most amazing flavors I've ever tasted, but that was not the case.    Moving on to dinner - I ordered the Roy's Trio, which included 2.5 oz servings of the salmon, mahi, and butterfish, and some rice.  Again, very small portion.  Although I was satisfied with the amount of food, my husband was not.  I like the butterfish very much and wished I had ordered that as my entree.  The other two were just \"meh\" as far as flavor for me.  My husband had the Ahi and he liked it but didn't love it (story of the evening).  We finished with the chocolate lava cake.  Great decision.  It was soooo good.  We aren't big chocolate people, but it just sounded good that night and boy are we glad we ordered it.  SO YUMMY.  I would have really liked Roy's if they had been priced just a little lower - I don't think my entree was worth paying more than $25 or so.  I have spent the same amount of money on the same amount of food (appetizer to share, entrees, dessert to share) at much nicer restaurants, which is really what is holding me back from liking Roy's more.  I would tell people to try it for yourself, but for us, it was fine but just didn't live up to expectations."}
{"text":"Really personable and efficient service.  Made reservation and had no unnecessary wait.  Minimalist decor that is very modern and relaxing.  Wine from the bar was good and reasonably price.  No cheap wine listed which I'm enough of a snob to appreciate.  Food was not overly filling and definately as tasty as it was good for the consumer.  The only draw back was the parking lot which wasn't well lighted and had people from the street who paid unwelcome address to exiting customers.  The need a presence in a door man to prevent this uncomfortable approach from strangers."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place I have eaten in all of Vegas so far on any of my trips.  This time I had the filet, but also had the sampler plate that has a mix of everything.  Their sushi is good, short ribs, potstickers, desserts ... etc EVERYTHING I have had here is AMAZING.  Do yourself a favor and go there and start picking any and everything off the menu ... I will be back to this place every time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place.. .. especially on Mondays.. with their 3 course menu special.. well worth the trip.. must try the hot chocolate soufflé..."}
{"text":"Food was great, solid 4 stars! The fifth star is for our amazing server Kristie! She was so nice and accommodating. The dragon shrimp, lobster, butterfish, and kim chee fried rice were excellent. The pineapple upside down cake is a must for dessert! Good dinner restaurant off the strip. Worth the 15 minute drive!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible dinner. Not only the wait was over 90 minutes for the entrees but the delivery of the food was not according to order = overcooked steak - extremely salty mushroom and limited customer service. Absolute under average experience not worthy a Roy's"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Roy's before but I wasn't super impressed.  I sat at the bar where there was little ambiance.  The butterfish tasted a little metallic but the miso sauce more than made up for it.  The lobster maki was delicious but the rice had far too much sake in it.  Overall, it wasn't worth the price for me."}
{"text":"I love Roy's! This location is nice, cozy and tucked away inside the JW Marriott hotel. Perfect for an intimate, exclusive vibe! I chose to have my birthday dinner here with a group of friends. The staff was very lovely and welcoming from beginning til end. Our server Clayton, was knowledgeable, attentive and fun. They made my occasion even more special with a complimentary round of champagne for my guests and I. The food, of course was fresh, eclectic, tasty and delicious! I never feel disappointed when I come to Roy's, a guaranteed awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Canoe for two appetizer is great!  I had the quad seafood platter... there is a trio listed on the menu, but the quad includes the macnut-crusted mahi.  I enjoyed the misoyaki butterfish the most.  I tried the pomegranate mojito.  The waitress warned me that it was made with patron silver tequila instead of rum, but I didn't really enjoy it that much.  I like the Kona Grill mojito much more.  But the food was world class and the service was great.  The waitress even brought me an extra pom mojito that the bartender had made in excess.  It seems like the dress is a bit more casual at this location than others I have been at."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  After a full day of attending a conference at the JW Marriott, I decided to grab Roy's to-go and cozy up in my room watching tv while eating #MeTime. Roy's is located on the first floor of the Marriott hotel - turn right at the bottom of the stairs (opposite side of the bar). The friendly hostesses directed me toward the bar to order.  Roy's Trio ($39.90): Misoyaki butterfish, blackened island ahi, hibachi grilled salmon paired with furikake rice and cucumbers. My favorite was definitely the grilled salmon followed by the misoyaki butterfish - both were flakey and cooked to perfection. Parts of the rice was soggy from the juices of the cucumber by the time I opened the to-go container =( 4 different types of sauces provided with the meal -- wish they provided some background as to what the sauces should be paired with.  For the price of the meal, I wasn't completely satisfied. Should have ordered the macadamia crusted mahi mahi instead!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit this restaurant for years and it was worth the wait.  The food was delicately prepared and arranged- beautiful presentations tend to make you savor and sample. And the butterfish!  It tastes exactly how it sounds. Our server was very versed, knowledgeable, and friendly. Small intimate setting. It is nice to know that Las Vegas has places like this that put a delicious and thought-out spin on what a typical meal consists  of."}
{"text":"This place was soooo good in many ways but I really held back on one star because the connectivity was a bit wanton. I felt I had to work to be treated like I belonged there commenting on the food. The lack of a sommelier is a noticeable miss also since there is an extensive wine list but nothing but up sellers pushing the most expensive options without real pairing consideration.  We found a pretty nice South African wine called Excelsior which was a less expensive cabernet sauvignon which matured in  stages.  It really went well with the all the fish with initial fruity tones of fig and a peppered wood. Sophisticated if you wait a good 30 minutes.  I got the combo trio plus one that is not on the menu but available... butterfish to die for, seared ahi ahi, teriyaki salmon, and a lovely grilled fish ( cannot remember which it was but it sat royally atop a lovely prepared potato slice).  Impeccable sauces and vegetable pairings were just the right thing to set this place apart from other fish houses.    I could not help but also try a guiness chocolate cake special.  If it sticks around, definitely try it if you want to skip the souffle.  But who skips souffle unless they've had it every day for a month?!   I have to acknowledge my servers, Ben and Erin.  They really worked hard to try to answer questions and were attentive to my needs.  My only note for improvement has to do with setting the tone initially.  There was something lacking a bit to make the experience warm from the start.  Perhaps it seemed too rehearsed and not genuine.  It was all redeemed after it seems Erin relaxed and was herself and got to really participating in our dining experience versus just serving us.  Does that make sense? In other words, by the time we were leaving I felt like she really did care that I had a good experience.  Still, it was good and I will return."}
{"text":"Everything was so flavorful. Lots of seafood options. Menu items truly are very creative."}
{"text":"We went to Roy's on a recent trip to Vegas.  I guess we were expecting the quality of the Roy's on Oahu.   Really, for how slow the restaurant was, I expected better.  Maybe we'll have better luck next time.   I do have to admit that the calamari was great but everything else was so so."}
{"text":"We have been to Roy's on island many times and have never been disappointed. When we learned that we have a Roy's in Chandler we knew we had to go see how it compared and we were not let down. Outstanding atmosphere, and unbeatable food, drinks, and service! I have never had better Butterfish and the sampler appetizer is fantastic. If your looking for an intimate this is it"}
{"text":"Amazing service (as usual).  For some reason, I disliked my mai tai so they let me order another drink with no problem. The food was great as usual but for me was missing that unique Roy's touch that I've seen both in Hawaii and Florida. The special roll for the summer was awesome.  Fresh, good fish.  The Korean fried rice side dish was only okay. Drinks are strong--I liked the drink with the date in it (like 1928 or something).  It was slightly sweet."}
{"text":"I've visited a few of the Roy's locations around the planet.  While this one is in no way exotic as some, it was very nice.  Remember, when you make Open Table reservations through Yelp, you don't get the dining points.  At least I did not when making my reservation for this location.  I broke one of my biggest dining rules when ordering here, and it cost me.  No excuse that I had been drinking at the pool for 6 hours prior to this meal.    Rule - never eat seafood unless you can see the ocean.  My scallops were burned on the outside and under-cooked on the inside.  Everything else about the meal, including orders of the rest of my party, was top notch as expected.  So, lesson learned.  Find places via Yelp - Reserve via Open Table - And order something other than seafood in LV.  Nuff said?"}
{"text":"Why the hell does anyone go to Kona Grill?  Unless you want to take a spray tan gold digger to be your wife, seriously the food blows.  Happy hour can suck it, like the girl who can't find a seat and has to sit on your lap.    Want great food, real happy hour, and a chill environment in real Island style hit Roy's.  Not only is their food fresh, delightful, innovative, and their staff is attentive and friendly.  We dont eat huge meals and they were happy to let us share.  The server actually recommended we have Opah two ways and both ways were wonderful.   They have a really cool cocktail menu and a great prix fixe menu deal this month.   The crab salad with mango and avocado is now a new craving.  I could eat this for lunch everyday."}
{"text":"Wonderful cuisine, beautifully presented! Every course was quite unusual. Very elegant but fun place to wear your Hawaiian attire and turn back the hands of time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant!   My favorite entree is something that I don't see on the menu anymore. It was a med rare pan seared salmon that was so delicious, and flavorful that it melt in your mouth and got you coming back for more! I used to come here often to order the same thing even when the menu has so much to choose from.   This Hawaiian Japanese fusion restaurant has tons of mouthwatering creations. I have tried the Misoyaki Butterfish, and I know a lot of people that like it, so i would recommend it.   I have also tried a roll that had wagyu beef, snow crab, tempura asparagus, avocado, and truffle greens which was really interesting.   I have tried the Lobster California Roll during happy hour once. But for $5, you definitely need two orders to be completely satisfied, it is NOT enough to share, especially if you came to eat!  All the food is perfectly portioned and full of flavor. I don't want to say rich to deter anyone health conscious.  The service is perfect. They have well trained servers and hosts that make sure that your experience is special. All the dishes come out moist, fresh, and decadent!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to do a review of Roy's when the wife and I went there for our anniversary dinner last year.  Anyway, the food was spectacular just like it always is at Roy's.  I had a jalapeno infused margarita that was awesome.  I've been trying replicate it at home but so far haven't been able to make it as good.  The table we were seated at was decorated, (since they knew it was an anniversary) and 2 managers came over to see how we were doing.  It must have been a great experience if I'm still thinking about it a year later.  Great food, great service.  Roy's always seems to deliver."}
{"text":"I like the tiki torches outside and the decor inside. I enjoyed the service and attention to detail and care the waiters gave us. From the time we sat down we felt so pampered. Who wouldn't want to feel like a king for the evening.   Our party ordered the sampler appetizer. I was disappointed with the Filipino lumpia. I'm Filipino so it was not up to the standard were acustomed to. In my opinion, it tasted like an old batch since it was a little sour. The beef sate was really good, same with the shrimp skewers, and the calamari. Me and my gf shared the Filet Mignon and the Sea Bass. Filet was just ok, I've had better. The sea bass was ok as well. I did like the couscous and mashed potatoes that came with our dishes.  For me the best part of the evening was dessert. The chocolate soufflé and pineapple upside down cake. This was memorable since I'm not a big dessert guy.   Final bill is $499 not including tip for 8 people. No wonder they took good care of us. There are places where the quality of the food, service, and prices make it all worth it. In this case I may go back for dessert but that's as far as I would go. It's way too overpriced in my book for average food and excellent service."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to eat at Roy's which I was soooo looking forward to.  It was my Mom's 75th birthday.  So we all went as a family affair.  The waiters were very attentive and handsome but that is all I'm gonna say about them.  The busboys were on the mark about cleaning up after each course.  My six-year old niece got special treatement which was great and kept her from getting bored like lil kids usually do.  Now about the food: CALAMARI-was ok.  Was kinda wet...don't know if it was the sauce on it or not cooked enough.  Ask for the sauce on the side so you can dip it yourself.  I've had better calamari and the tentacles were missing. (HOUSE SPECIALTY)-HAWAIIAN MARTINI-on the strong side...tasted good...strong....a wedge of pineapple on the glass...nothing spectacular.  RIBEYE-I always order medim.  Nice size, tender.  I can taste the burnt parts. It's ok-at least it was really grilled.  Some sauce on it...again...shoulda asked for sauce just on the plate or on the side.  I don't like my food soggy.  Mashed potatoes very buttery...but it was...umm mashed potatoes.  Green beans-tasted like green beans.  I didin't like and I usually like the green beans. The sauce tasted buttery and the rib-eye had an assortment of mushrooms on it.  I love mushrooms but they did not excite my pallette. My son ordered the BBQ CHICKEN- he was not thrilled with his order.   My sister ordered the BUTTERFISH-I think she really liked it..especially the sauce.   My parents ordered the SURF AND TURF-they finished it (either they were really hungry or really liked it! lol) The menu had a special HAPPY BIRTHDAY greeting inside it for my mom.  Nice touch.  As the dessert came CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE- a special plate for my mom was brought out.  Candles, happy birthday on the plate with chocolate sauce and some cute dainty cupcakes for her.  The souffle was yum.  Hot and melted chocolate inside.  My son described it as a CHOCOLATE LAVA.    ...overall- AMBIENCE:  dark, great place for a date. (too dark for my mom's eyes-she had a hard time reading the menu)  I liked the fact there was an eating bar overlooking the kitchen and you can see the chefs working their magic.  ...WAITERS-easy on the eyes, attentive ....FOOD-take it or leave it.  Maybe I was expecting too much since I heard so much about this place and it's \"Hawaiian-Fusion\".    I want a place to \"WOW\" me!. I want to eat something I could not cook at home.  It was a nice place...but it does not get an OMG from me.  Try it for yourself for the experience."}
{"text":"Went twice during a recent visit to LV.  The first night, we hosted a party with five guests.  The waitier Edmon tried to upsell us at almost every opportunity, from a suggestion to start with a house specialty cocktail..to the tune of $14-15 each.  Then some high-priced appetizers were suggested.   He was more that happy to suggest some pricy wines, which of course would have spiked his \"fixed tip\" (due to  the size of the party they added 20% to the total).  Was the food good?  Yes, but the service left a lot to be desired  The second day my wife and I stopped by for happy hour.   A great value.  Good drinks and good pupus.  Like Roy's at Hawaii Kai! ;)"}
{"text":"Top-notch: - Food - Service - Atmosphere - Memories  Roy's is probably one of the best places to celebrate a birthday; the staff here treated me like I was an A-list celebrity and they shouldn't have! The place is impeccable and the \"tiki torches\" outside are an interesting touch to the restaurant.   Appetizer: Lobster Potstickers (not memorable but delicious nonetheless) Entree: Macadamia Nut-crusted Mahi Mahi (melted in my mouth) Happy Ending: A plate with some fruit dessert and \"Happy Birthday\" with my name \"written\" with icing which was NEAT! :) The menu also had my name on it which was kinda creepy.  The BEST THING about the experience was not just the interesting shit talking we had in our table but the ATTENTIVE SERVICE! Not just our server but the hostess, busser, chef, and manager came individually to check on us and if our tongues and brains agreed with our food. The hostess even opened the door for us as we exited. It felt nice but I felt guilty at the same time. Thank you Roy's for the exceptional experience!  Plan your next birthday here! :)"}
{"text":"I had an amazing birthday dinner. Steak was delicious. Cooked just right. Service was spectacular.  Very attentive.   Everyone should expierence Roys you won't be disappointed. 5 stars, they earned it tonight especially since the whole place was packed with guests.  Thank you."}
{"text":"All I have to say is- start with the pineapple upside down cake with coconut ice cream.  If you eat nothing that night this is a MUST!!!!!!  Everyone was nice- I was disappointed that my drink glass not only had chipped rim in many spots but there was a huge crack that was ready to go. My girlfriend had chips on her rim glass too.  Split the sushi appetizer- it was perfectly seared Ahi Tuna- perfectly cooked- but it's spicy. I am not a huge spice fan so I cut the edge and then was able to tolerate it.  Had the bass- just as wonderful as I though. My girlfriend had the halibut- yummy. The oven roasted tomatoes on the halibut plate were AMAZING- but only two little slices. When it's that good you want a bowl full.    The setting was a bit dim and low noise level. We were getting tired just being there. They need to turn up the lights.  I would go back without a doubt- but I am not kidding when I say probably THE best dessert I have had in my life- and I know desssert!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can not say enough good things about this place, great food, atmosphere.  Total package, always have a good time here!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, but it was a very disappointing experience. Food was mediocre to say the least. WAY OVERPRICED!!!!! $260 for anniversary dinner. There was nothing special about the set up or experience. Server didn't even come to check on us once our food arrived , I had asked to speak to her as she recommended a dish but forgot to mention my food would be smothered in wasabi sauce! it was so gross!!! So in general , food was over priced ,service sucked and the experience brought me to tears almost, worst anniversary dinner ever! Next time we will stick to our usual ... Melting pot or Different Pointe of view."}
{"text":"When in AZ, you must come here and dine in the grand courtyard out back, They got tiki torches, tall heaters, fire pits, huge, fireplace, 69 degree perfect weather and no bugs! Best alfresco dining experience in my life!!   Now you gotta try the food. Comp edamame, Asian spare ribs, Roy's Ono, caramel infused rack of lamb, and homemade coconut ice cream. And the best damn be bim bop I've ever had, period."}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance of this restaurant.  The food was amazing and the service was excellent. We started with the Famous Roy's Hawaiian Martini, Lobster Potstickers for apps, Scallops and Swordfish for our entrees and everything was cooked to perfection.  If you are a dessert lover like I am... especially CAKE, you must try the Pineapple Upside Down Cake served a la mode...SO Good!  This was  my first time, but I will definitely dine at Roy's again!"}
{"text":"I was here for my friend's birthday. My two stars were for the service and environment not the food. The food was way overpriced and not good! I ordered a Seafood Hot Pot. I expected to see a HOT POT! BUT nope, my dish had a overcooked small size lobster, 3 medium size shrimp and 10 big shells with pinky size mussels on top of two bites of salty noodles . It cost me $40 for that. I am not sure what they cook with their food but my mouth and throat were so dry and uncomfortable after the meal. To me, it's not worth it. I had better somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Roy's three days in a row and each day was great !!  Ben and his team took great care of us and, of course, the food was great !   Amazing food and service.  Thanks a million !"}
{"text":"A delicious ALOHA hour experience. Review is of bar-seating and happy hour only.  Roy's is a chain, but this a chain I can get behind. Food is creative, yet sensible. Selections on the HH menu seem to be well thought-out and executed. I would not mind one bit returning to Roy's for another HH session, nor would I mind returning for a full out meal.  My friend and I dined on a Tuesday afternoon around 5 PM. We sat ourselves at the bar, which was empty, but became full as we passed out time there. Our bartender was congenial and happy with us, except toward the end when he realized I would only be having one cocktail during my time there.  Ordered:  Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos ($6) - A decent little presentation of hard-shelled tacos filled to the brim with Mahi Mahi. I did like the tacos, but wish the fish had been more prevalent. There was quite a bit of some kind of sauce in there that I could have done without and just had the fish. It was still good.  Ahi Roll ($6) - A very nice roll presented on a plate of sauce with wasabi and ginger. Soy sauce and chopsticks were provided. The roll was good enough for me, but I have had better at restaurants that specialize in sushi alone. But do not take that as the roll being disappointing and bad, as it was good and met my expectations.  Wagyu Sliders & Sweet Potato Fries ($) - I shared this with my friend. The slider was delicious. Very juicy and the meat was so incredibly tender. It comes on a pretzel type bread which is presented with great care. The fries were very yummy and a delicious alternative to plain-ol French fries.  Texas Blackberry Lemondrop - Off of their specialty cocktail menu this drink was recommended to me by the bartender. It is a beautiful magenta color served in a martini glass with a mint leaf on top. The drink is very refreshing without a harsh alcohol flavor. I doubt it will get you anywhere near being drunk, but it's still a nice concoction.  Overall: Food, while good was not perfect. However, it is definitely high ranking. The bartender's service was also pleasant and I believe my friend and I had a nice time here. The lighting is a bit dim, but once you're inside for a bit you do adjust.   I want to go back to try a full-out meal (and definitely try their butterfish I hear so much about!)"}
{"text":"Went late at night after New Years and it was almost empty. But the service staff was very fast and friendly. The Butterfish was AMAZING. The Mahi Mahi was a little overcooked but still good. I also loved the Hawaiian Martini."}
{"text":"My husband and I totally, totally loved Roy's.  Definitely not inexpensive and quite expensive for us.  We celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary here this year.  I made a reservation online, very easy.  Saw their menu online, so I knew our dinner was going to be over $100 for the two of us.  Neither of us drink alcohol, so that greatly tamed our bill.  The ambiance is romantic and tropical, but noisy and fairly dark.  The staff there from the time we entered all treated us like royalty as well as the others.  They had a note for us in our menus helping us celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We really loved the personal touch.  Our water glasses were always refilled.  The food was scrumptious.    For appetizers, I can't remember the exact names, we had some pork spare ribs (this was a lot and I expected a couple spare ribs but it almost seemed like 1/3 or 1/2 a slab of baby back ribs.  Very tender and cooked perfectly.  My husband LOVES ribs.  I ordered some type of beef spring rolls, but spring rolls for the Asian is not deep fried, rather they use rice paper.  They deep fried these \"spring\" rolls.  These were delicious, but the most expensive eggrolls I've ever eaten.  Still that's fine.  I think appetizers price can go from $7-$15.  Every plate that came out from the appetizers to the dessert were all beautifully decorated.  Different people other than the main server checked on us.  They made it very special for us.  For dinner, my husband ordered some stuff pork tenderloin stuff with pecans and dates with a bacon risotto.  We've never eaten not fully cooked pork before.  We were uncomfortable with eating medium rare pork and sent that dish back to the kitchen to have it cooked more.  They were fine and didn't treat us as if we were ruining the chef's creation.  My husband liked the pork well done and not pink.  This was probably in the realm of $28-30.  I had some butterfish, which is a black Alaskan cod that just melted in your mouth.  The sauce had a sweet taste to it and it was atop baby bok choy and a black rice.  Very yummy.  I think this was in the realm of $35+.  I didn't expect the portions of food to be so big.  I was thinking the portions would be more along the lines of French food, so by the time dinner was done, we were stuffed and had to take home some food.  This was more than enough food and we didn't have any room for dessert, but they surprised us with this beautiful plate of desserts with \"Happy Anniversary\" written on it with a trio of desserts on it - creme brulee, some chocolate thing and something else.  All very yummy.  Though we were stuff, we ate this and this really put us over the edge.  We gave a really big tip because they gave us way, way more than we expected with top notch service.  This won't be a restaurant we frequent due to price, but it is definitely worth doing on a special occasion.    This was a wonderful date.  All the food was yummy.  Excellent service and worth every penny."}
{"text":"I have been a longtime fan of Roy's for almost ten years! If my travels come across a Roy's I am sure to dine in and enjoy the food and ambiance this restaurant provides. I have spent just about every occasion at Roy's; birthdays, anniversaries, New Year's, I even brought my entire wedding party to Roy's in Hawaii when I got married. Needless to say the service and food have been consistently good while the prices are very fare.  My latest journey into Roy's was off of Flamingo in Las Vegas; the manager this night that personally greeted our table was Chris Korom our server, Michelle. My husband and I ordered appetizers and the short ribs (one of our favorites)! While we did feel one of our appetizers was a little off this time the rest of our meal was amazing! We like to give feedback so we kindly asked Michelle about our appetizer to see if any recent changes had been made to the menu or prep and she immediately informed Chris of our tossed feelings toward it... Chris then re-visited our table apologized and brought us out desert on the house. Now this is important for everyone to know, one of the prime reasons we choose Roy's for our very special occasions is because we know we will never be disappointed; just as this case proves! Chris and our waitress went above and beyond to make sure we were not only 100% happy with our meal and visit but 110%! Chris brought our three deserts for us not just one. With this he brought out something new, chocolate doughnut holes! I always order the chocolate soufflé however if Chocolate doughnut holes are on the menu I will be sure to order it again! It was wonderful to my taste buds, just fantastic.  Again, this restaurant and its employees did a wonderful job and my husband and I will be sure to go back!"}
{"text":"Hmmmmm.....  My husband and I came for date night and thought we'd treat ourselves to a great dinner. We've always wanted to try Roy's, especially since I'm from Hawaii and a chef who's specialty is in the same realm of fusion.  I could've cooked us a great dinner....I probably should've....now we know.  Started off with a slow restaurant and hostess trying to seat us right next to a loud party, literally right next to them c'mon, who thinks that's a good idea.   I will also note we are both in F&B positions.   Don't get me wrong, service from Regi was great, besides the constant reminder of dessert before ordering, while ordering appetizer, again while ordering entree, and AGAIN after taking 2 bites of entree.   Had a glass of Parradox Cab ($18) and Mai Tai ($12) to start, both delicious!  Started with Garlic Prawns ($12) which consists of 4 21/25 shrimp (maybe smaller). Delicious but imagined atleast 16/20's or something a bit larger based on description. The Brussels sprouts and sauce were amazing though.....however we ordered prawns, not Brussel sprouts.  Husband had he Roys Trio ($36 - forgot actual price) and I got the Shellfish Sampler ($42?). Husbands meal was good, but not as good as we were expecting.....just a \"eh it's good\". Mine on the other hand was a big disappointment, the lobster tail was overcooked and unseasoned, bland and chewy, just what I was hoping for . Crab cake mushy and the \"teppanyaki shrimp\" was the exact shrimp as our \"garlic prawns\" but with a different sauce c'mon Roys, thought you could come up with something better than that.  Basically mediocre food for shelling out $160 ($135+tip).   Didn't leave with the same smiles we had when we arrived. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is great for both happy hours and dinner.  I usually sit at the bar side for dinner.  Matt, bartender/ manager, is awesome. We always had great service at bar, awesome entree/appetizers n drinks ;)."}
{"text":"Must say this is one of my Favorite places to spend my money even better the Bestbuy and I love electronics.  I have always had a quality dinning experience be it in Oahu or here in Chandler.    My favorite dishes- all of them, you can't go wrong.  They even have fantastic dishes for children which are priced reasonably.   You must get the chocolate soufflé, if you go- order ahead as it takes 25 minutes to prepare.  I usually ask for an extra scoop of vanilla ice cream.  We go here for all of our special occasions.  You won't go wrong if you do too!!!  Butterfish! Even the meatloaf rules!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  we started with the pork ribs and sushi sampler appetizer which were both amazing...dinner the teriyaki salmon was great and you have to get the chocolate lava cake for dessert.  All this for $36.95 makes it a great value and worth the trip."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service ever... came in for a very expensive dinner with 4 people waited, waited, waited... and finally got water, a special occasion my parents came 10 years ago for an anniversary and got nothing the same... the manager Steven gave no care, and the server (Daniel) gave little effort ... spent hundreds and would have rather went to in and out"}
{"text":"03/31/11  Had planned to partake in Fleming's happy hour (had a giftcard), but came here instead when I saw how busy it was at the bar (and I didn't want to sit outside in the heat).  I knew Roy's had a quasi-HH (free edamame-- what kind of HH is that?), so I had resigned to have Roy's tasty Waimanolo (sp?) salad.  Surprise, surprise!  Roy's now offers four food items (ahi tuna, calamari, Wagyu sliders, and beef skewers!), as well as a few wines by the glass and ALL of its signature cocktails during happy hour for $5 each!  I've tried the skewers before and wasn't too impressed, but I knew the calamari was very good, so I didn't go for that (even though I really wanted to have some).  No, what I had my eye on were the Wagyu beef sliders, w/ caramelized onions and, wait... what else did I read?  Sweet potato fries??  Oh, yeah!  My name was all over this dish!  I also placed an order for chardonnay, but I changed my mind when I saw that I could try another of Roy's signature drinks-- the last ones I'd tried many, many months ago were my espresso martini and a friend's lemon martini I'd sampled.  I was doubly-excited when I spotted Roy's Hawaiian take on the classic sidecar!  This happy hour was going to be FUN!  The Fred and Ginger cocktail did NOT disappoint!  It contained Hennessy VS cognac and Domaine du Canton ginger liqueur w/ a candied ginger peel garnish served in a martini glass.  It was beautiful to behold and so very delicious to sip!  'Twas a shame I couldn't finish the whole drink-- had to save some room for the sliders and fries (and the dessert I hadn't even planned on having later on!).  I really liked the sliders-- there were two of them, one on either side of the mini-Chinese takeout box filled w/ seasoned crispy sweet potato fries.  The sliders tasted like Whoppers (back in its heyday in the early 80's) kicked up several notches (LOVED the crispy/chewy pretzel buns!), and the fries were seasoned w/ herbs and even had a bit of cheese drizzle here and there!  I would definitely order the cocktail and app again, and for $5 each, they're a steal!    (I almost did not want to yelp about Roy's happy hour, bec. I wanted to keep this a secret for a little while.)  Thinking back, the cocktail and app would've been enough to satisfy me for the rest of the day, but I didn't really want to leave Roy's just yet ( had planned to write a review or two), so I broke down and decided to try the Chocolate souffle ($9.95), Roy's take on the chocolate lava cake, but w/ homemade vanilla bean ice cream and a raspberry coulis.  This item is baked to order, so if you are on a time limit, you should place your order in early, as it takes about 20 minutes to bake.  Was it worth the wait?  Hmm...  I liked the outer edges of the chocolate cake, which had the chewiness of a soft, fresh-baked brownie.  The lava center was definitely gooey and rich, and it tasted like hot brownie batter.  I think I'd have enjoyed the cake and its lava center a lot more if the accompanying vanilla ice cream was of a better quality.  I didn't care for its texture (not creamy enough), nor its flavor (vanilla bean specks were absent and the vanilla essence wasn't strong enough).  This dish cost as much as the app and cocktail combined, and I didn't think it was worth the price.  Can't wait to go back here for HH w/ friends!"}
{"text":"Roy's is a nice restaurant located in the Casa Paloma shopping center with an array of Tiki Torches surrounding the exterior of the restaurant and ample parking. The inside is nicely decorated with painted plumerias and a vibrant saltwater tank.   The service was slightly slow and disorganized yet not horrible.  The Ahi tuna roll was fresh, flavorful and filling. The Macadamian Nut Mahi Mahi was better than what I read on the prior reviews and the dish was accompany with crisp cooked asparagus and properly seasoned potatoes. The chocolate flourless torte cake was the best of all. As I cut my fork into the delicious piece in front of me, I see a warm chocolate center oozing onto my plate like lava exploding out of a volcano. The taste is perfection in my mouth and worth the 3 miles on the treadmill.  I also found out the restaurant offers both regular happy hour and reverse happy hour. Prices are only valid at bar and not formal dining area. Go to their website to view the aloha happy hour menu."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and each time has been excellent. Our first time was in Hawaii and we were happy to see one in phoenix.          Me and my Fiancee had a four course Valentine's day dinner here. Dinner was great.  Food was timed right and our server was on top of it.   Our server sent us a personal handwritten post card thanking us.  Dinner came to be a little over $200 with drinks, so yes its pricey, but my fiancee and I loved it so it was worth it."}
{"text":"There were some very high points and very low points to this 12 person weekday dinner.  I had made the reservation earlier in the day and had to put down a credit card to hold the reservation.  My 3 aunts and 1 uncle went early, during happy hour, and absolutely loved it.  The other 8 in the party arrived for dinner and we were promptly seated.  Both my uncle and I ordered the miso butterfish which we both thought was amazing (tasty and moist) but my husband thought it bland.  Three people got the filet mignon and all said it was tough.  My mom got fish with no salt and sauce on the side but it arrived in the standard preparation so she sent it back.  One persons fish was raw in the middle, another person's was overcooked but still tasty, they said.  They messed up the dessert order (forgot to bring out one of the two souffles which take 20 minutes to make).  In the end they comped us nicely (add 1 star) but I don't know how they messed up so much.  I am attributing it to the large party size but we only had one person with special requests."}
{"text":"Was an amazing experience. I had reserved the table through OpenTable and mentioned in there it was my anniversary. The service we got was amazing. They even brought out a little anniversary gift/desert for us. Took our picture and gave it to us. Was a great experience. The food was good, the service was good. I dont know why it took me so long to get in here and eat, but it wont be this long before our next trip."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed ourselves. We ate outside which was beautiful. Night time with the fire going. Food was delicious and the service was great. I read some of the bad reviews and don't know why they had such a difference experience. Ours was great!"}
{"text":"Great services from the doorman on the way in to the hostess stand out. Knowledgeable waiter and efficient bus staff. I had an opportunity to try a few things on the menu, Roy's Canoe Appetizer for Two appetizer ( Szechuan Baby Back Ribs, Blackened Ahi, Crispy Spicy Tuna Roll, Lobster Potstickers, Pork & Shrimp Lumpia ), Honey Mustard Garlic-Charred Beef Short Ribs and the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish. The Butterfish is the best fish I have ever had. We finished off out meal with the melting hot chocolate souffle, and it was amazing.   I will be visiting Roys in Baltimore where I live and the one in Vegas when I go back. I was very impress, the best meal I had during my week in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fire Grilled Filet Mignon with White Cheddar Mac & Cheese was amazing.  Great food / great service.  Finally try the molten lava cake....what else needs to be said."}
{"text":"RIPPED OFF.  Received an offer for a cooking class/lunch for $49 per person.  Reserved two (my guest was celebrating a birthday and this was my gift to him).  Menu was supposed to be:  Burrata Salad with Heirloom Tomatoes, Short Ribs and Butterfish, Meyer Lemon Tart.  These dishes are described in a small booklet/menu placed at each place setting.  First of all, it is not a hands-on class.  You are seated with about 30 other folks at round tables of four; and at the front of the room is a Chef standing behind a banquet table with a portable stove on it. Its impossible to actually see what he's doing and this particular \"Chef\" was, seemingly bewildered.   It was a bizarre demonstration.  He started by explaining that they were \"out\" of the Ti leaves, in which the fish is cooked and so he would be using Taro leaves instead, which \"are poisonous and leave a weird sensation in the back of ones throat\".  So, NO, don't eat those.  We were instructed to marinate the fish for 3 days & make sure that it's \"cooked through\"' because butterfish is \"slimy\". So, after that setup, I'm praying that we wouldn't end up food-poisoned.  Oh, and they \"didn't get the Heirloom tomatoes in\", so cherry tomatoes instead.  Then, he explains how \"we don't make our Burrata (cheese) here\" and proceeds to dump it out of a plastic tub onto a cutting board.  Salad was supposed to be a \"tower\" (alternating heirloom tomatoes with the burrata).  It was an extraordinarily long, meandering \"class\" and he admitted that he really wasnt aware of \"what's on the menu\". It's like a substitute teacher was brought in and didn't know what was going on.  Nice guy though and it would have been amusing if I wasn't (over) paying for this....  So on to the food, which was actually prepared by the kitchen and served after each of the \"Chef-Tutor's\" monologues:   \"Burrata salad\":  cheese slices with some rock-hard green cherry tomatoes tossed about.  Entree: tasty but SLIMY fish, leathery short ribs, and some weirdly molded rice wedge with what looked like lime green confetti dusted over the top.  Lemon tart: was not actually a tart.....it had the consistency of a dry & dense polenta and was bitter.  Ugh....  To add insult to injury, the bill presented had another $25 tacked onto it....for 2 iced teas, coffee & tax.  So, I got to pay nearly $120 (after they deducted the $4.00 coffee I never had) for 2 mediocre lunches and a wasted 2.5 hours. Gratuity, of course, was extra.  When I phoned the Manager after leaving, he suggested that I \"come back in (Now!) and I'll give you a coupon for a discount the next time you visit\". Big whup.  Anyway, last time for me at Roy's....here AND in Hawaii."}
{"text":"The lobster potstickers are to die for! I get the blackened Ahi every time and it never disappoints. I love that it feels like I'm on vacation every time I go. Highly recommend!"}

{"text":"My boyfriend and his family are huge Los Angeles Kings Hockey fans. Every year The Kings play a preseason game in Las Vegas, and it always falls on my Birthday weekend.  This year mom wanted to join us so she could celebrate my birthday weekend with me.  To celebrate my Birthday she took me and my boyfriend out to dinner at Roy's at 7:30p on September 28, 2012.  I had an awesome Birthday experience!  We were lead to our table and handed customized Birthday Menus announcing MY Birthday!!!  This customized approach really adds to the reason's of why I'm glad I chose Roy's as my Birthday dinner place.  Our waiter Thomas, made for a very welcoming experience, his personality makes you feel as if you are right at home. He was very attentive and informative and was able to accurately describe all the dishes we asked about and make them seem tantalizing.  He also peaked our interest with some of the specials he described.  Throughout the meal we never had to want for anything as he was always available to serve us.  We decided we could order a few plates and share a bit as well.  To start -The Lobster California Roll:  I order variations of this roll at many places I frequent and Roy's did not disappoint.  Also the portion was a very good amount so that we were all able to share and there was still a piece or two left.  My Mom - Shellfish Sampler: The lobster tail was huge and very meaty.  It melted in your mouth.  The scallops we so tasty and also huge. The crab cake recipe was delicious.  The curry sauce drizzled over the meal was flavorful and just the right amount of spicy/smokey taste. They should really bottle and sell that stuff. Normally I don't go for alot of carbs but I couldn't stop eating the Macadamia Nut Pesto Risotto from her plate.   Strawberry Daiquiri - How could you go wrong with this?  and Roy's did not disappoint.   Me - Lilikoi Pear Salad: I love their Candied Macadamia Nuts! I was eating a salad but it definitely felt like I was cheating. There was plenty of Gouda cheese in the salad, unlike some restaurants who want to skimp on the expensive cheese.  The Asian Pears went great with the salad and the dressing balanced it all out. DeLoach Pinot Noir from California - I loved this wine.  It was rich and had a slightly sweet red cherry or blackberry hint to it.  My Bf - Pan Seared Trout.  Again, the portion of the meat was more than expected. This fish was flaky and smooth.  The sauces and side dish pairings were detectible. The Jalepeno Margarita - We are Tequila drinkers and our favorite mixed drink would probably be the margarita.  This is why this menu item piqued our interest.  This is definitely not your normal margarita but if you are in the mood to try something different it is one that I would recommend.  The Chocolate Molten Cake was very decadent.  The only problem was that I was stuffed! As the meal went on and on I was getting so full, but yet all the food was so delicious that I couldn't stop taking small bites of everything.  By the time the Chocolate Molten Cake arrived I could only squeeze in 3 or 4 bites.  Even as full as I was, it was the Best Chocolate Molten cake I have EVER had!  It was just crispy enough on the outside with a pool of creamy chocolate inside of light and fluffy cake.  So rich, but still edible.   I would definitely recommend Roy's for any occasion.  Friends in town, Birthday, Anniversary, or just looking for some place to eat where you know you will get detectible food of good portions, no matter what you order, exceptional service and attentive staff plus a lovely ambiance."}
{"text":"A fine dining restaurant that offers a great affordable menu during their Aloha Hour (4:30-6:30). And in the words of the eccentric Nicki Minaj, it got that super bass. $5 drinks and appetizers are too good to pass up, chain or no chain. The setting was dim, clean and a bit romantic. Their workers were totally friendly and attentive. Based on my observations, I conclude that it attracts Summerlin housewives and retirees who love to slurp on pink drinks and wine. Bravo TV, if you plan on casting for the Real Housewives of Las Vegas, come here. They're botox and Louis Vuitton ready, trust. Anyway, I recommend their sliders, lobster potstickers and tempura tuna roll. I'm unfamiliar with their drink menu to recommend anything because I stuck to wine. I saw only one beer though. And bar space is limited to a few tables, so I was lucky it was dead when we came. Despite this, I still would visit to unwind with a bunch close friends."}
{"text":"I love everything about Roy's.  Everything.  I started going there for wine club. If any one from Roy's happens to read these reviews please please please please bring back wine club what happened???  Much like a meal let's start with appetizers. This was the first place I've ever had sweet potato fries. Sounds weird right? But it's not. On their happy hour menu they have sliders with sweet potato fries and they are amazing.  They have a little garlic on them they are just so good try them immediately!!  All of their main dishes are incredible imaginative and tasty.  The desserts are so good but unfortunately I have never tried any of them except for the chocolate cake.  They all sound good but when I think about having anything but the chocolate cake it hurts my heart.  Tell them at the beginning you're going to order that for dessert because it does take a little extra time but it's well worth it and it's well worth the price tag.  I always want to go to Roy's."}
{"text":"Had sushi roll. They are good !! Menu looks attractive l. Need to come back to taste the meat."}
{"text":"Walked in at 10:15 and they completely ignored me, I mean not even a word.  I never ever complain about service but this was just ridiculous.  At least address me and tell me it's closed, but ignoring the situation is unacceptable.  I've been here a dozen times and I've enjoyed myself, just let down."}
{"text":"I recently came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend. My parents had recommended the place so I figured I'd give it a shot. I loved the ambitious and feeling of the place, but felt the food could have been slightly better.  To start we shared the lobster potstickers which I think were great, prob the best part of the meal.  For entrees we had the filet minion and seared scallops. Both were good, but I didn't like the pork belly that accompanied it. I also felt that the garnishes outweighed the food. Meh.  For dessert we had a chocolate soufflé which was exceptional, the raspberry sauce really pulled it all together. They also took the time to write a birthday message on the plate. Great service! I'd definitely return and hopefully another dish will better meet my desires."}
{"text":"I liked the place even approaching it, nice steak and seafood place.  Walk in, greeted by a nice host, there for my wife's birthday, she was treated very well and they really \"do it up\" for you.    We tried potsticker appetizer, it was amazingly good.  We tried a shellfish sampler and a surf and turf and we shared both.  They were top notch.  We tried a pineapple upside cake (called something else), it was amazing.  The drinks were very nice too, and for the FIRST time, a bartender made my wife a vodka martini that was excellent (she has always said only I make them worth a damn).    I finally have a place to go to for great seafood, even if I have to go to Vegas for it, I will be back.  The price is what makes this place 5 stars, because other places with similar approach and quality charge a lot more."}
{"text":"Great food in a very nice hotel. Good service but I did feel rushed. Not many people as I was in early but I am not a fan of being asked about dessert when I have not finished my dinner."}
{"text":"Great place to celebrate a birthday. Short ribs was delicious."}
{"text":"Roy's is never a disappointment. And everytime I go there (any location) I eat and eat and eat. I mean everything is excellent. This time I tried their Jalapeno margartia and it was excellet. I need to learn how to make that! Had the boat of appetizers which includes the shrimp, short ribs, lobster pot stickers and dim sum. It was all perfcet of corse. I mean seriously I may get flagged for this review because it might sound like I work here I like it so much. But I DONT, its just that good. Got the Ahi tuna which was awesome, the mustard sause was too spicy for me (and I like spicy hence the jalepeno marg) but I think it had wasabi in it. Then for desert the coconut cheesecake was devoured in 3 mins. Went away full, happy and wanting more."}
{"text":"This place is heaven on a plate!  This was my second trip to Roy's in Vegas (we first discovered it's wonderfulness in Hawaii on our honeymoon).  Service is outstanding.  We were celebrating our anniversary during this visit.  We received a specially created menu for the occasion, in addition to a nice, formal picture that was taken by our server and presented to us in a cute frame at the end of the meal.  Now...where to begin with the food!  My husband has celiac disease, so he needs to eat gluten free. Roy's has a decently sized gluten free menu, which included a grilled trout option, that was similar to salmon, and my husband devoured it.  Also, another added bonus is that they have freshly made California rolls (no imitation crab here...only the best of the best).  Because so many restaurants use imitation crab which includes gluten, a simple California roll was a treat for him!  I ordered the ahi tuna steak, medium well.  In addition to rice, and steamed bok choy, the sauce included with the fish was a spicy mustard, which was outstanding (I wish I could have bottled some up to bring home and put on all of my food...fish, chicken, even steak...this stuff was great).  The only thing I would have changed is to have had them cook the tuna slightly less, leaving it a little more pink in the middle.  Even so, that was totally my fault...the restaurant actually recommends the tuna to be cooked rare.  Finally, topping off our meal, were two desserts for our anniversary, one which included a pretty plate, decorated with \"Happy Anniversary Kim and Chris\" in chocolate, with a side of coconut sprinkled sorbet.  My husband also couldn't pass up the gluten free, molten chocolate cake with a side of vanilla ice cream.  I had a taste myself...very very rich (I don't even want to think about how many miles I'd have to run to burn it off if I had eaten the whole thing), but very yummy.  So overall, I love this restaurant.  It is probably one of my top 5 of all time.  The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because it is so pricey, so even though the food makes me happy, my credit card bill will be crying out in pain next month.  Regardless, it's perfect for that special occasion (like an anniversary) and I highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are some bad reviews. We came here 3 years ago for our rehearsal dinner. We were treated like royalty. Three years later, nothing has changed. The food was delicious and the service was beyond excellent."}
{"text":"My hubby and I ate here last night for my birthday dinner.  I wanted to go somewhere close to our house but didn't feel like steak.  A lot of independent restaurants are closed on Mondays so that is why we had to do a chain. I am not sure if that also explains why this place was so packed.  It may also be due to the fact that they have a great prix-fix deal on Mondays where you can get almost any appetizer, entree, and dessert combination for just $37.  Not a bad deal since we both left the place absolutely stuffed to the brim and we are both big eaters.  Overall, the service at this place is really great and the food is prepared well.  I really enjoyed our visit there but I would never really become a regular since for some reason I am just not a fan of their menu.  I love seafood, but most of their dishes come with a ton of sauce or crusted or wrapped in something.  I think if you have fresh, high quality seafood then you should just let the flavor of the food shine through.  That's just me.  I did really like the taste of the wasabi sauce on my butter fish entree. I highly recommend ordering that dish. And also, their cocktails. I have sampled a few of their specialties on the drink menu and they are all quite good even if they are way overpriced.  I think Roy's is a great option for happy hour when you are looking for something a little higher class than your basic patio bar or for dinner when you feel like a taste of the islands. But I can't honestly say I'm a fan, hence the three stars."}
{"text":"I HATE chain restaurants.  No matter how much people tell me how great they are, I feel like I'm getting something ordinary.  This is soooo not true with Roy's.  Each restaurant carries the vibe of the city it's in.  The SF Roy's pulls you in from Mission street with the copper topped bar and two level open dining room.  It pulsates with the City vibe, but has just enough of the Hawaiian undercurrant to remind you where you are eating.  The Phoenix location has FLW influenced touches and feels both contemporary and familiar.  The same goes with the food.  I've had a half dozen dishes on the menu, and while I hate to say it, everything is good here.  I'm partial to short ribs and their's are the version I compare others against: fork tender with a rich sauce, not fatty or tough and resting on a bed of mashed potatoes that manage to be creamy without being dense.  Seafood is a specialty.  Their seared tuna comes with a wasabi and a mustard sauce and both complement this delicious dish.  For a great value, order off the seasonal Prix fix menu. On my last visit, we ordered one prix fix and two appitizers for my husband and I.  There's was more than enough food and we were able to try a wider variety of dishes.  Oh, and the shrimp risotto app came with two monster shrimps, perfectly cooked, of course.  We also got the seared scallops, divine in a lemongrass cream sauce.  Service is a standout here.  No matter what you ask for the staff are attentive without being overbearing.  I always feel like a welcome guest when dining here.  And just to be clear, we are not big spenders, but I feel like a high roller no matter what we order. Bottom line; Roy's is one of the best chains around."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined here on our way out of Vegas the last time we were there. All I have to say is... the food was amazing. We shared the braised duck leg to start as well as the Szechuan pork ribs. The sauces on both were incredible. I ordered the rack of lamb, which came with scalloped potatoes (holler!) and the boyfriend ordered the grilled pork tenderloin (served medium rare) with bacon hasbrowns. We finished the meal with a chocolate lava souffle, done so right. The vanilla ice cream augmented the dark chocolate so well.. ugh. Burned my tongue on it, I wasn't able to control myself. Also ordered a latte.. so good!  The staff was very courteous and did everything in their power to make sure we had a remarkable experience. The restaurant was very quiet but it was the perfect way to end a Vegas trip. Full and happy!"}
{"text":"We came on Valentine's Day with a special four course menu. Everything was delicious. We went with another couple and all ordered different items. Food was yummy, though it was pretty pricey! I think I'd only come back for special occasions. Filet mignon was to die for and I loved the peanut butter cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Oh...Roy, you big stud you! I love me some Roy's.  I specifically like Roy's Happy Hour. It goes on till 7, thanks for waiting Roy's! And, there is something on the menu for just about everyone. The drinks are fantastic and so well made. The bartenders are always gracious and if you want to chat it up, they will keep you entertained. The food is absolutely fabulous. There is nothing not to like. Lobster Potstickers are a particular favorite as is the Ebi roll. Wagu beef sliders anyone? Yes, please!    You can make a meal out of a couple of appetizers, have a few drinks and for two people, get out of there for about $40.00. It is a lot of fun and the vibe is always fun and casual. It is not $2 beers or chips and salsa and I'm thrilled with that because you won't find me eating that..."}
{"text":"Even though Roy's is a nationwide chain, it's a pretty nice chain, built from the hard work of creator Roy Yamaguchi, whose Asian-fusion dishes embody the spirit of Hawaiian cuisine.    A nice perk of making reservations here online is that they offer 1000-point Opentable reservations for certain times and days.  This will put you half-way towards redeeming a gift certificate!    After we got seated and were poring through the menu, we received a plate of steamed edamame to snack on.  They were nicely seasoned with a sweet-salty-spicy mixture.  They currently offer a prix-fixe menu, where you get your choice of 1 out of 3 appetizers, entrees, and 1 out of 2 desserts for about $36.  Our waiter recommended a few a-la-carte items for our meal, which is what I ended up ordering (Go with what the experts know!).    I started with the lobster potstickers.  They had a nice crunchy pan-fried outer texture to contrast with the ginger-lobster filling.  The lobster was nice and tender, and had a delicate flavor that went pretty well with the sauce and glaze accompanying the dumplings.  My husband had ordered the prix-fixe menu, and decided on the citrus salad, which was served in a beautiful presentation, with bright, vibrant colors, and refreshing flavors.    As for the entree, I got the recommended misoyaki butterfish.  The butterfish was indeed a tender, buttery melt-in-your mouth texture.  The glaze seemed more heavy on the \"(teri)yaki\" side rather than the \"miso\" side, and as a result it was a bit too sweet for me.  There was a small bed of a pico de gallo type mixture on top of the fish which helped balance out the sweetness of the glaze somewhat, but I would have needed more of it to go with the rest of the fish since it was a limited amount.  The presentation was beautiful, as the darkly glazed fish was perched on top of a bed of bok-choy and forbidden black rice, surrounded by an emerald green wasabi sauce.  I also tried some of the prix-fixe pork shank, which was fall-off-the-bone tender, excellently seasoned with a lovely broth-like sauce.    We shared dessert, which was the chocolate souffle.  The molten dark chocolate in the souffle was nice, and the cold vanilla ice cream was a good complement to the deep, rich chocolatey hot souffle.  Service was a little sluggish, but friendly.  If you feel like splurging on a good meal, Roy's might be a good choice if you want an upscale Hawaiian experience in Arizona."}
{"text":"We made reservations for 12 for dinner on a Sunday evening (12/20/15) after our wedding. We didn't tell them it was our wedding beforehand, but they figured it out quickly enough when I showed up in my wedding dress. The staff and managers treated us like royalty. We started out with a champagne toast. Our daughters were getting a little fussy and hungry, so they quickly brought out a snack for them while we were waiting on the rest of the meal. Everything was delicious. The presentation of the meals and desserts were outstanding. All around an excellent job and SO appreciated. They helped make our wedding day special. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Things weren't up to par last night. We had a reservation, but the 4 people checking in folks were flummoxed by the two groups in front of us without reservations and by answering the telephones. We had to wait. And wait and wait. The food was good for the most part. The dim sum pork belly was not. The dough was oddly chewy. Service was forgetful and rushed. They should turn down the background music. The noise level was jarring."}
{"text":"My husband asks me to travel with him, often.  99% of the time, I just can't get away.  However, when he told me that he was going to Scottsdale AND that there's a Roy there, I asked him to book my ticket immediately and I would clear my schedule!!  We live in Charlotte, NC and the closed Roy's is 6.5 hours away!  Shameful!  Let me preface the 4 star rating by saying that it really should be 4.5 stars, but that's not an option (Hello, Yelp...get with the .5 star ratings already!).  I really wanted it to be a \"5\" experience, but it didn't quite live up to the 5 star stellar perfection of the experience that we had at Roy's in Waikiki Beach, Hawaii.  If the Miso Butterfish (one of Roy's Signature dishes on the menu at all of their locations) was prepared exactly as it was in Waikiki, then I would have given 5 stars, no problem!  Everything else about this visit was spot-on, but the difference in the fish had to take it down to 4 stars.    We arrived early for our reservation so we waited at the bar and enjoyed delicious drinks and an appetizer from the Happy Hour Menu until our table was ready.  My husband had the Mango Mojito and I had the Hawaiian Martini.  Both of them were strong and delicious.  The Hawaiian Martini was my favorite drink of the week!  I ordered the Happy Hour Tempura Crusted Spicy Ahi Tuna Roll.  It was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!  Easily, the most delicious thing I ate all week....and I ate some really good food in AZ that week!!!  The Bartender was new to that location so he was still learning the ropes.  He was SO nice, very friendly, and very attentive.  He's going to do great there!  Our table opened up just as we finished our appetizer.  We were seated at a nice table that had great view of the dining room.   My husband ordered the Bing Cherry stuffed Pork Tenderloin.  It was beautifully plated, seasoned perfectly, and was moist and delicious.  He was very pleased.  The Apple & Goat Cheese Potatoes Au Gratin were also excellent.  As mentioned earlier in my post, I ordered the Miso Butterfish.  It was very good, but it wasn't the sublime dish that I had in Waikiki Beach.  The flavors were only marginally different, but enough to make a difference.  We ordered the Kona Coffee Creme Brulee for dessert, but it was a bit too strong tasting for my liking.  Service was excellent, attentive, and timely.  The restaurant is very pretty and the overall ambiance is inviting and upscale, but still comfortable and not stuffy.  It was a great meal and a lovely dining experience.  I would definitely go back and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service was great. For appetizers, we tried a couple of kobe beef rolls however the one with shrimp tempura tasted better. I don't remember what its called. For entree, I had the tiger shrimp with pad Thai noodles. It was good but I wish it came with more noodles. It was like a tease. BF ordered the fillet and it came out perfect. Best part of the meal was the chocolate souffle. Oh my god it was freakin delicious! Don't leave Roy's without trying it. Meal was pretty expensive but its expected for a fine dining experience. There's a Roys in Newport Beach too. Wonder if the food is similar."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this spot for about 7-8 years and I have to say that that the level of food quality is declining.   This used to be a great spot to take everyone because I was sure they would love the food and ambiance but in recent years the ambiance has remained in tact and the menu/chef has declined. Beware, the surrounding area is pretty scary at night.   The sushi appetizers are all absolutely delicious: namely aunt leis roll and the sunrise. You can't go wrong.   Entrees are iffy...the menu has changed. The butterfish is the best on the menu but the tempura sea bass is HORRIBLE.  Very poor execution. So bad that it was the first and only dish that I've returned in my life at any restaurant. It's oily and covers the flavor of the fish (waitress specifically recommended it stating that it's surprisingly not oily). I've also had the poached, somewhat dry lobster. Guests of mine have had non fish dishes and I've heard mixed reviews.   As far as cocktails go, the Hawaiian martini is amazing and the desserts are all top notch if you have room. (Order early as they take a while to make).   One note: the waitstaff is always impeccable and helpful. They are trained well in always satisfying the customer (waitress that recommended the returned sea bass was overly apologetic to the point that I felt bad)."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dining experience at Roy's. I've heard much about how good the food was in Hawaii and I was recently in town for some bachelor parties.  The waiters were always attentive but the most impressive thing was how much they could accommodate to orders that weren't on the menu.  I heard great things about the butterfish but I also have a soft spot for lobster tail. So a simple request to do half and half was easily taken care of. No hassle and no crazy bill adjustment. Our table soon quickly changed their orders to this custom one and we were all taken care of.  Drinks were quite stiff so I was glad I was getting my money's worth. What was interesting was the staff even took the time to print out little leaflets and place them in our menus to commemorate our bachelor's big day.   About halfway through dinner, the waiter had the courtesy to inform us that there were specific desserts that needed additional prep time and should be ordered at that point. Incredibly thoughtful.  At the end of dinner, our bachelor was treated to an actual printout with our group picture for the event.  I returned to vegas the weekend for a second bachelor and had the exact same excellent service: A guest of ours had ordered a dessert that required extra time to bake but was mistakenly forgotten about. Roy's quickly took action and awarded him with a free dessert on the house which tasted delicious.  If you love seafood, you have to check out Roy's even though it's off the strip"}
{"text":"This is the first Roy's that I ever went to and I was VERY impressed. Every course was dynamic, interesting and delicious. I still day-dream about the perfectly done, chocolate souffle. I've had so many of the things here at different restaurants with bigger-price tags and I don't think they ever come quite close."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 19th anniversary with dinner at Roy's. It was absolutely amazing. I ordered Chef Quy's NY strip steak and my husband ordered the butterfish. Everything was delicious. I can't forget to mention the Jalapeño Margarita...YUM! They took a picture of us with our dessert (the chocolate souffle was amazing as well) and within minutes were back with a complimentary picture to remember the evening. Everyone was very nice and professional. They kept checking on us to ensure we had a great evening and a great anniversary.  Thank you Chef Quy and team. The experience was amazing!!"}
{"text":"What a great dinner date spot. You don't have to worry about getting all fancied up but still get a fancy-nice dinner. They even open all the doors for you on your way in AND out!   Also nice to see that they have a fixed menu for little more than the standard entree. The mochi-covered seared ahi was an interstingly delicious start. The mochi and crunch from the sear really work with the truffle essence/foam that they top it with. Continued on with the macadamia crusted mahi mahi. Talk about delicious. The fish was wonderfully prepared, and the crunch from the macadamias was nice.   Finished off the night with the chocolate souffle which definitely did not disappoint. I really hate it when people have their own \"interpretation\" on the classic, so I definitely appreciated Chef Roy's true-blue version, raspberry coulis and all."}
{"text":"Hello my old friend Roy. I don't know why I wrote that. Ok, whatever moving on. One of the nicest places to enjoy a food and drink adventure alone or with friends. Aloha Hour(Happy Hour for all you main land peeps) reigns supreme for getting to know the Pacific Rim flavors. Aloha Hour Bar Bites and cocktails are $7. They have a couple of wines and a craft beer on the special menu as well.   Located inside the Desert Ridge Marriott  Aloha Hour:4:00 PM - 6:00 PM Late Night Aloha Hour:9:00 - Close"}
{"text":"I stopped in for dinner while on business travel.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and the staff was helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.  I went with the fish sampler which i enjoyed and green beans.  With tip it came to around $55.  i prefered the mahi mahi of the three.   PS.  The happy hour has a burger that sounds good."}
{"text":"Began our meal with Beef curry empanadas:  very delicious   For a main dish : \"Classic Four\" fish sample plate with crab lump fried rice   New York strip steak with lobster Mac and cheese.   A perfect finish to our meal was enjoying both of their signatures desserts:  pineapple upside cake with vanilla ice creams and the chocolate mouse \"lava\" cake."}
{"text":"Very corporate but very excellent. The server did the best she could with her mandatory talking points but a scripted feel still bleeds through. It's not the sever's fault. In fact, she was awesome. Everything front of the house was on point. It's not a new place and they've kept it up wonderfully. The food didn't disappoint. I had a perfectly cooked steak, my wife loved her shrimp and we devoured the lobster pot stickers almost too quickly. For dessert we had a chocolate lava souffle a la mode with raspberry sauce. It was good but I'm sure there are more interesting desserts there and I will definitely go back to find out."}
{"text":"Ate here on Valentine's Day, I must say it was delicious! I started off with the Garlic Prawns which were cooked to perfection. S and entree I had butterfish..I think it was a Little over cook and for the price it was sort of a bummer... The tomato salad was on point it had a mix of sweet green tomatoes and red. I also love the Crispy Pork Steamed Buns!!! The dessert was ok I had a chocolate cake that was sort of dry.. Overall it was still a good experience dining at Roys... Last thing is if u do find yourself here u must try their Hawaiian Martini Omgeeee!!"}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner here.  Service and food was great, enjoyed the surf & turf, which was incredibly delicious and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Pricey but delicious! This place is located inside the JW Marriott so the price tag is not surprising. Thankfully my parents were treating. We had a great meal here last night. The weather was spectacular and we were able to dine outside by the light of tiki torches.  Great starter salads. I had one with pears and strawberries. Very fresh tasting fish. Sampled the ahi, salmon and to die for butter fish. Next time I would just cut to the chase and gorge myself on as much butter fish as possible.   We had GREAT service. My dad has lots of food allergies and our server went out of his to way to accommodate him and went as far as finding out all the ingredients in the sauces to find out which ones he could eat. They only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because for the price the servings were pretty tiny. Especially the sides with the main course. Be sure to order and appetizer with your dinner if you are very hungry!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They make a wonderful black cod dish! The fish is ALWAYS fresh! This is tough to do with black cod, but it is my favorite fish! They also have a wonderful Aloha Hour that includes the kobe burgers. This is a must try! Their drinks are great too. My favorite is the Hawaiian martini."}
{"text":"Great Service and Awesome food.  Everybody at the restaurant goes out of their way to make sure you have a wonderful experience.  I really enjoyed the lobster potstickers, the sushi and butterfish.  Roy's Las Vegas is a restaurant that you must try if you are in town.  I would recommend making reservations in advance."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant the service was excellent and I love that they had gluten free and vegetarian menu and the food was really good :-)"}
{"text":"We recently celebrated my mom's birthday and were treated to a wonderful time by Roy's on Flamingo in Las Vegas. This was our first experience with Roy's. This location is a few blocks from Las Vegas Blvd on E. Flamingo and it was nice to get away from the cheesy strip for a bit. My folks travel quite a bit to Hawaii and enjoy Hawaiian and Asian food and Roy's Hawaiian fusion menu sounded perfect so we made reservations.  From the moment we arrived we were impressed by the impeccable service as two sets of doors were held open for us. The decor - modern but casual - tasteful with clean lines and not Vegas cheesy. A few of us arrived early so we tried a couple of mojitos. Jeff the bartender was great - he was friendly, easy going  and helpful. My brother got a guava mojito and I tried the pineapple ginger mojito - both awesome (my family likes to share food and drinks with one another just as a note).  When the rest of our group arrived, the Hostess, Betty took great care of my family, welcoming everyone and making us all feel at home. We were seated and the staff went to work offering water, unfolding napkins etc. Yes, they really were like a bunch of ninjas making sure everyone's needs were met. My nephew made a comment that he finished his soda and turned away for a second and when he turned back his drink was refilled.  When it was time to order and this was our first time at Roy's, Bobby, our head waiter went over the menu, explaining the appetizers, entrees and desserts. He went over which ingredients were local and which ones were flown in from Hawaii. He even checked to make sure no one had any specific allergies.  As far as the food goes, it was magnificent! On time and perfectly prepared. Most of our family enjoys sushi so we started with the maguro, unagi &  Lobster California Rolls. We also had the crispy vegetable spring rolls and the Crispy Karaage Calamari. This was on top of the yummy & spicy edamame courtesy of Roy's. The maguro was refreshing but the unagi was delish! Big, fat pieces of unagi (some places skimp on the eel).  The California roll was good but fairly standard tasting. The Crispy Karaage Calamari was excellent! It was really crispy, tasty, tender and not at all greasy! Excellent technique and presentation. I tried to get a picture of it but the group demolished the calamari before I could snap a photo (sorry if my incessant picture taking annoyed the other guests). The veggie rolls were delicious too. Very crispy with a wonderful sauce!  For entrees, we had (and shared) the \"Pulehu\" Sirloin & Maui Onion Jus, the \"Mojo\" Grilled Pork Chops, the Rustic Grilled Filet Mignon, the Teppanyaki Seared Tiger Shrimp, Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Blackened Island Ahi, Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish, the Prosciutto Seared U-10 Scallops, Dynamite Glazed Tiger Shrimp & the Hibachi Styled Grilled Salmon. It was all so delicious! The meats were all cooked perfectly to order and all the seafood came perfectly cooked - nothing overcooked and nothing raw. I can't stand undercooked fish and rubbery overcooked shellfish and will send it back. Two items that really stood out were the pork chops, which had an amazing flavor (I begged for the recipe for the marinade and finally got a list of ingredients - without the measurements, of course so I will never be able to re-create it) and the Butterfish. This Butterfish was a firm, large flaked but fatty fish. It was absolutely wonderful and I will now go to Roy's in San Francisco just for this fish. The rest of the food I tried was also delicious and not one in our party had a complaint (and we love to complain about food). I can't wait to try the Roy's in Kihei as well! We all tried the molten chocolate souffle, the pineapple upside down cake and the passion fruit dessert. Incredible!   Finally, I just want to thank the amazing staff at Roy's on Flamingo in Las Vegas. To the hostess, Betty and also to Bobby, Jeff, Troy and the rest of the staff and servers - Thank you so much for making our stay in Vegas a wonderful memory! To Kathryn, the manager, thank you for your hospitality and professionalism - you really took care of my family. Thank you for all the special birthday touches and for having the cabs called. My mom is still raving about it. Also to Chef Percy Oani and your wonderfully skilled sous-chefs ... BRAVO! We are huge fans and will eat at your restaurant whenever we are in town! Thank you Chef Oani for coming out to meet us as well - we will cherish the pictures we took with you. So I guess, my critique is a bit biased but it cannot be helped as our experience was flawless!"}
{"text":"We decided to start our high roller evening at Roy's for its Aloha hour. Though we did not order food, what we saw others eating looked very good.  On the first round I ordered Roy's Original Hawaiian martini (SKYY Vodka, Stoli Vanil Vodka & Malibu Coconut Rum) while my wife went retro by choosing Roy's Island Mai Tai. On the second round, there had to be one, my wife wisely chose the Hapa Margarita martini (fresh citrus, Jameson's Irish whiskey, Grand Marnier and agave). Not to be outdone, I ordered the 1988 (Finlandia Grapefruit, SOHO Lychee & Patrón Citrónge). Each drink was delicious and priced right.  Our servers were very congenial."}
{"text":"We stayed at the JW with a bunch of other families (12 adults, 14 kids) and wanted to have a private adult-only dinner.  I contacted the restaurant's group coordinator (Kaleb) and he was awesome in helping me plan.  Since we were dining on a Monday night, we was able to book on of the private rooms for us with a pretty low F&B guarantee ($900).  I had preordered 4 canoes (appeitizers).  We we arrived, we were quickly escorted to the back room.  At 8pm, the restaurant was about 75% at capacity.  The back room was nice.  There were sliding doors for privacy and we were able to control the thermostat and music easily.  We had multiple waiters and servers there to help us and never had to wait on anything.  Our drink orders were taken right away and the canoes came out.  The highlight of the canoes were the pork ribs and shrimp skewers.  The cocktails were good and better priced than Meritage ($8-12 vs $12-15).  One of the girls didn't like hers and they quickly exchanged it.  We ordered some beet salads and hanger steak loco mocos.  The salad was a hit as well as the loco moco.  Some of them came out with the fried egg overcooked.  The waiter apologized and quickly had them fired up some new ones.  Not a big deal.  The loco mocos were very very good.  I could have probably have eaten that for the entree. The one thing that really impressed me about the restaurant was that they were so willing to make substitute and customize our menu.  Most of us elected for the Surf n' Turf and that (the hanger steak) could have been paired with pretty much anything (lobster tail, butterfish, mahi mahi, shrimp, etc).  I paired mine with the butterfish and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The Hanger steak came out already cut and was tender.  The flavor was just ok.  However, the butterfish was awesome...just melted in your mouth and was very flavorful.  Everyone loved their food.  Only complaint was that the surf portion was small...can't have everything. Dessert included the pineapple upside down cake and the chocolate souffle.  The pineapple cake was very buttery (a tad too much) and the souffle was great.  We had a great time and really enjoyed dinner.  Roy's is a perfect place for a group.  Very convenient access from the hotel (literally outside the elevator).   If we return to this resort, I will be calling Roy's again.  You can't be the food, service, or value."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night for a pharmaceutical dinner presentation. I was early as usual and was shown to one of their private dining room. This room was nicely decorated with a nice big flat screen tv in the front. The problem arrived when the rep came and found the room set for 20 people when her contract was for 25. The server was no help and got the manager. He was very calm and polite and quickly tried to find a way to solve it. The room supposedly fits 28, but I think that would have been pretty damn tight. After making some arrangements, he was able to set up the room for 25 with a few square inches to spare. The AV was not an issue. From that point forward, service went well. The server was great in taking orders and bringing out the items. The guests all had a good time and the food appeared great. I am unable to comment on the food because I didn't get a chance to try it. So this review is strictly based on service and facilities.  I would return and give them another shot at it."}
{"text":"One of my best dining experiences ever! Amazing food and service! Ask for Talisa, she was beyond fabulous and best of all, genuine. Roy's exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 6pm at 5:45pm via the yelp website.  I also put in a little note that it was our anniversary.  We were seated right away, our Anniversary was recognized by the server and with a special dessert! Our server Stacy was fantastic! The food was wonderful! For appetizers we had a surf and turf and the lobster pot stickers. Oh my goodness! Our main course was divine! My husband had their 3 seafood special with lobster and shrimp.  I had the Crab Dynamite Broiled Barramundi which was recommended by Stacy and both of us were thrilled.  We only chose this place because we had received a gift card, it will however become our new go to restaurant!"}
{"text":"My dining partner and I honestly hadn't been back to Roy's (Chandler) since our 1 visit in 2014. We received an email invitation from Roy's that Caymus Winery was hosting a Wine Dinner with limited seating. The menu preview sounded fantastic, so we jumped on it.  Apparently Caymus Wineries hosts this Wine Dinner every year. It started off with a Mix & Mingle introducing their Champagne and an introduction to their wines and a short video of the history of the winery. Then followed the 5 course dinner paired each with a different wines. We started with the Dungeness Crab then the Sea Scallop & Foie Gras, followed by an Alaskan Black Cod and a Wagyu Beef Short Rib, finally to end with a Baked Alaska. All the while sipping on their selections of Caymus Blended White, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. All the dishes and wine pairings were absolutely spectacular!  Again keep in mind this was a Roy's hosted event with Caymus Wines and a representative along with Roys serving staff and chef to make these special dishes for this occasion.   Private room, service and food 5 STAR! I would recommend this to anyone next year when Caymus Wineries comes back."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience.      I have been wanting to come here for a while and so glad I finally made the time.  We booked a table on the Open Table app and wow that was awesome just walking in and being seating right away.     Everyone was very friendly and eager to answer any questions we had as this was our first visit.     The food was outstanding.  Great seasoning and excellent combination of flavors.  We started with the lobster potstickers, which were very good and u highly recommend.  My girlfriend ordered the scallops and pork belly and they were very tender and cooked perfectly.  I ordered the Braised Short Ribs. Wow they were delicious, tender, and perfectly seasoned.  The mash that came with them was just as excellent and the broccolini and carrots were simple yet a nice touch.    We had mentioned we were there to celebrate an early birthday, and even though it still wasn't her bday Roy's still brought us a dessert and even took our picture from their camera and printed us a photo.     It's the little things that stand out the most and Roy's excelled in that area.  I highly recommend to everyone and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday nite with our good friends to celebrate their 25th anniversary for happy hour and dinner. We sat in the bar for the Happy Hour specials which were great. Not too busy as it was Sunday. We had 8 in our party and it was getting a little busy for the bartender to keep up, mentioned it to the manager and Wala- she took care of everything and some. The food was exceptional. Excellent sushi, pot stickers, ribs- yum! Roy's stands out as one of the best east valley restaurants and last night was no exception. Been here a few times and have never been let down. Thank you for a great night out."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for a belated birthday dinner and everything was WAY beyond our expectations. I have know about Roy's even back when they were a Flemming's restaurant...but had never eaten at one. The owner of some of our favorite Denver restaurants got his start at the original Roy's in Hawaii. I am not a seafood fan...but my wife is and it was her birthday. She LOVED her fish and I thought my Filet was very good. All of the sides were great and the service was also really great."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was fabulous! Lobster California rolls and the lobster and shrimp omelet were all SO delicious. I'm glad this seems like a well-kept secret as there was no waiting and our server, Kim, could be very attentive. This was a special occasion meal and everything was perfect."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic up scale resturant. Happy hour is cheep but the regular menu is pricy how ever that being said the food is worth the price! We had a fantistic time the fish tank is unbielievable and the decor makes you happy you came so do the servers. We had the 3 corse meal for $35 the fugi apple salad was the best salad I have ever tasted and the Coco vin was soo good and so much I had to box it up to have room for thechocolet suffle which is delish!!!!  The lobster potstickers were great everone loved their selections and koodos to Roy;s"}
{"text":"Really bland food, really overpriced.  Menu has your mouth watering, but you should eat the menu because all the preparations are dull.  No bread, edamame,  I like it but others don't.  Asked for salt and got it half way through the meal.  Fish was good quality but really for the price it ought to be.  Tempura was very oily, I have had much better in no frills ethnic places in Chicago a million times.  $220 for 2 of us, and the wine was not that pricey.  Save the money, go to Red Lobster...."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving Roy's two stars is because my husband and son loved the food.  I found Roy's to be disgusting and bland. I do not believe the food is very fresh. The server was nice and took great care of us!!! I do not recommend Roy's to anyone. Just go to the fantastic restaurants next to Roy's!!!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for restaurant week and it was really, really good. I have been to Roy's in Florida and was impressed so I figured it had to be good in AZ too. We'll it was and being gluten free is a big plus for me. The short ribs were amazing and my husband had the crusted mahi mahi, my appetizer was so large I could not finish my entree or desert, brought leftover short ribs to my room can't wait to eat them maybe for lunch today. Attentive staff, good ambience, great dining experience."}
{"text":"We love Roy's and have been to many.  Went here for Aloha Hour and it was great.  Bar staff was very friendly, appetizers and Hawaiian martini were awesome.  The pineapple slices from the martini process - yum!  Thanks guys!  The only downer about this place is kind of the location, parking lot is kind of scary."}
{"text":"Another trip to Arizona and another trip to Roy's. Certainly a different experience than I had the last time. Friends were talking about the \"Aloha Happy Hour\" from 4 to 6 pm so we stopped by. Their outside patio is probably one of the nicest spots in town.   Everything on the happy hour appetizer menu is $5 and trust me my party tried them all. They also have a special 'cocktail\" menu (everything is $5) if you are looking to expand beyond wine and beer.   Happy hour can include anything from crispy lobster potstickers, lobster spring rolls to mini burgers or tenderloin tips. All delicious and certainly enough to fill even a hearty appetite. Our server \"Rebecca\" was not only very attentive but also very knowledgeable and helpful in making our menu and drink selections.   A sure \"winner\" and probably one of the best deals in town."}
{"text":"This was such a great restaurant in sad to see it's closed.   My favourite thing was the Ahi Mignon.   RIP :("}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is awful. We showed up for our 7pm reservation and ended up waiting over 25 minutes in the lobby for our table to be prepared. We were offered a table in the bar area but what was the point of making a reservation for that.  Once we finally got to our table it was another 15 minutes before our waitress bothered showing up.  Before we could place our drink orders she disappeared.    Once we finally got her back and placed our order, things went better. The drinks were Devine and the food was delicious. I would highly recommend their signature drink that comes in the metallic pineapple. We just had to laugh how comical the service was. If I'm going to spend over $100 for a meal, I would at least like to be waited on a little.  Hope this place can get its act together as it really does have a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Had my Birthday dinner here while staying at the Marriott and the service and food were exceptional. you have to get the lobster potstickers and sushi for appetizers and the butterfish and short ribs for main dish! so yum!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming to Roy's for may many years. Well, more so the Kahala and Ko'olina location. This location was the first time but, I have to admit the food and sauce are very consistent which I find fascinating being that we are in the continent and not in the islands.  It was nice having our server from the islands and few other workers as well, I was feeling homesick on Christmas eve, missing the food, and family so having to be in the presence of some local people from Hawai'i was super nice and being able to talk hawaiian pidgin was a major plus! Totally needed that.... Now, back to the food I had their delicious seasoned pre fix menu, it's super easy  selection for me because everything is all chosen for me I just have to select which appetizer, meal I would like and I always love Roy's Chocolate soufflé.  I love the shrimp with the their wasabi sauce it was soon ono if I knew it was that delicious I would of just ordered a big order of just that...Lol! For pupu's we had Lakanilau Rolls- yummy, my husband and I shared the ice berg salad which is always refreshing and for my meal choice I had their alaskan halibut, the sauce on the fish was good but, I think it was a little over cooked but, it was great though considering usually I order the Mahi Mahi or Ono fish. My husband had the short ribs and of course, we cannot forget Roys Chocolate souffle, my favorite for many years.  I'm happy their is some kind of island flavor here in Phoenix area with some local people working in the industry it's a nice feeling being away from home, now if only you guys can incoroprate some hawaiian entertainers to come up and play on special occasions that would be even better... :-)"}
{"text":"The bar drinks were strong! Try the red, white, blue shit for the 4th of July The food on the other hand was terrible! The salmon was dry no flavor. Actually everything was without flavor & not to mention it's expensive."}
{"text":"Come here for aloha hour and you won't be disappointed I promise! We always sit up at the bar to have some appetizers and their incredible mango mojitos! Best things ever!  Justin served us today and was really attentive. I have a gluten allergy and he was so knowledgable and helpful! Note that they have a GF menu and can make most dishes GF if you ask. We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Marriott for a work conference this week. We had a team dinner at Roy's. We tried to get reservations for two days but they were not able to accommodate us until tonight. The restaurant is cozy and the menu is great. The portions are smaller than I expected, but honestly, they were the perfect size. Especially after eating appetizers.   I recommend this restaurant - but it is pricey."}
{"text":"Lobster potstickers make it worth the trip alone. Ordered the Roy's Trio because I couldn't decide, it featured Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Misoyaki \"Butterfish\" and Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi. All were delicious but next time I'm saving room for just the butterfish. Loved this place."}
{"text":"Super good ... these guys understand the restaurant business .... service was perfect .. they didnt rush us or ignore us ... food was perfect from cocktails/appetisers to dessert ..."}
{"text":"I've been to Roys before but this was my first trip to this location.  It's premium price but their food is solid and the service is outstanding.  We had some questions regarding the menu and wine pairings.  Our server was well versed and provided sound guidance.  We ended up with PEI & lobster apps.  I went with the Ahi as a main dish.  All prepared with skill and wonderful presentation.  I prefer the hidden \"hole in the wall\" but this is a great place to have in the resort."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Everyone was so friendly. It was super refreshing.  The current reviews are not giving this place the credit it deserves.   Excellent service, excellent execution on our entrees.  Some nice extra touches by a complimentary photo, and birthday desert for my fiancée.   Great job guys!!"}
{"text":"Sooo Good, our family loves this place, super kid friendly too.  The dumplings are so good."}
{"text":"Visiting from NYC and found the food and service excellent. I ordered off the winter pre fixe menu. Our server, Aaron,was attentive and gracious to the many special requests of our dining partners. I would return!"}
{"text":"Yea...uhm Whoever has been to Hawaii, knows that this is not Hawaiian food. This is Hawaiian fusion. Uhm Where's my LocoMoco or my kahlua pig. Even better yet. a bowl of freakin rice.  Yea if I wasn't tricked to this place being hawaiian food I would have probably rated it higher. I just missed real Hawaiian food. Poke is good if it's done right. I miss Trader Vic's or even real home cookin like Bruddah's in LA! Yea baby. Well Aloha Kitchen is good home cookin hawaiian food. Maybe I'll go review that....Ok so 3 stars because I was TRICKED like a John looking for a 25 dolla fix."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour, which is bar only. Shame because it was a nice night, and the patio was dead. The cocktail menu was fairly big and not badly priced at $6 a pop. The appetizers were fine, too. I recommend the sliders and the rolls.   So why three stars? Because for a happy hour, it was all just meh. The food was fine, but not outstanding or particularly filling. The cocktails were fine, IMO, but others at our table found them too sweet. Very limited beer selection, too.  Looking at the regular menu, there's no way I could swing those prices for the plates I saw people receiving. I hear the chocolate souffle, though, is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Place sucks ....., I eat every day slow... Very slow ....there are other places to go  It took 30+ to get the food"}
{"text":"Stopped in to this place to hang out with a friend that was visiting on business and staying at the Marriott. The company was buying our drinks, so how I could resist?   The atmosphere was very inviting, dark and private but still the kind of place you'd love to sit down and hang out with old friends, which is exactly what we did. Service was fast and attentive, not to mention extremely pleasant, both of which were surprising given the crowd.   I'm a fan of the Marriott in general, but I'd go back again just to hang out at Roy's with friends or colleagues. Definitely a nice place with a great decor and perfect for bar hopping or hosting a happy hour after work. You can't beat the tropical paradise surroundings of the hotel, or the awesome effect of the flaming torches that line the patio.   Looking forward to giving them another try in the near future, and will definitely be updating this review as I try more of their offerings. For now though, I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Aloha hour is where it's at!  $6 menu with assorted signature cocktails and apps!  Loved the Mahi Mahi tacos.  Only downfall is there are no kid friendly items available during Aloha Hour.  Makes a bit of sense it is Happy Hour (adult friendly) but it is located at a very family friendly resort."}
{"text":"Ugh, it hurts my heart to leave a three star review but as much as I love Hawaii, Roy's is really just \"ok\" in my opinion.   Lets start here: the food was great but the service was really lacking personality. We came in pretty early, around 6pm and our server was nowhere to be found so another server did the diligence of saying \"I'm free, let me take your order.\" From then on, we still never saw our server. Thanks to the food runners & bussers who were taking care of us. Near the tail end of the meal we ordered two desserts and only one appeared at the table. We finally flagged down our server and it seems like he just forgot. 5 minutes later, dessert came, cool, they even comped one of them, not complaining. For some reason, I just felt like Roy's didn't live up to the 4.5 stars Yelp gave it.   See ya Roy's, I'll probably try Morton's next time."}
{"text":"I decided to take my bff to Roy's as a surprise for his Bday. I had an evening planned of dinner and fun and Roy's was definitely an excellent choice for his surprise seafood wish. To start off dinner we actually had a couple of the \"Original Hawaiian Martinis\" - Maui pineapples are drenched in SKYY Vodka, Stoli Vanil Vodka & Malibu Coconut Rum.Shaken and served with fresh pineapple (SOOOOO Yummy.) We then decided to skip the appetizers and went straight for our dinner entries. My bff got the Roy's Trio which had Hibachi Salmon, Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi & Misoyaki Butterfish then sides of Baby Bok Choy & Steamed Rice. An absolute must try if you have a hard time deciding to dedicate to just ONE fish :-) I did the Shellfish Sampler (another moment of indecision here) which had the Butter Poached Half Lobster Tail,Seared Crab Cake, U-10 Sea Scallop & Shrimp with the most delish Macadamia Nut Pesto Risotto & Lobster Curry Sauce. Absolutely amazing. Our two dishes together made for a teeny little Roy's sampler buffet and was to die for. Unfortunately at this point we were way too full for dessert so we will be going back to try their Prixe Fixe menu. A side note, my friend got a special little menu with his name on it and the Happy Bday greeting. nice touch. We had only experienced this one other time at the Oceanaire in San Diego ."}
{"text":"It makes me very sad to remove 3 stars from my previous review, but unfortunately things have changed at Roy's.   We had a party of 8 and being frequent diners at Roy's, we always request the patio. I called earlier that day asking for patio seating. The hostess told me there is no table that can accommodate that many people. Huh? Okay, whatever! I've been there before with that many people and sat on the patio with no problem.   I arrived a little early for my reservation so I took a stroll outside and find a 10 person party sitting at a table on the patio. Hmmmm.... Not too happy about that. I tried again to request a patio table, but it was too late. Fine.   It was Arizona Restaurant Week and several of us ordered from the special price fixed menu. The fish option was a Barramundi (white flakey fish similar to Mahi Mahi). It was super salty, over cooked and quite frankly unedible. We sent it back and ordered Seared Ahi Tuna instead, which was also unedible.   I can't believe what a huge disappointment the food was.   On top of all of that, valet parking used to be complimentary when you dined at Roy's, however they changed their policies and it's now $4.53. WTF!?! Who charges $4.53 for valet parking???   So long Roy's and JW Marriott...won't be seeing you anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I would never eat here after the greeting...the greeter said what? I asked can I see a menu. He said \"well it's there if we were open but whatever\". I said \"what time do you close\" greeter \"9pm\". I said \" well it's 850 and we're hoping to have a good dinner and not leave the JW Marriott property\".. he said \"well we're closed\" I'm confused you just told me you stop seating at 9. If this is what Marriotts top of the line hotels \"JW\" is about and \"Roy's\" then I am out. Roy's is clearly to pretentious to what people."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent.  The butterfish was unique; we had never tasted anything like it.  I had sushi for the first time and it was great.  The service was attentive but not obtrusive  It is pricey.  We made reservations through Open Table and didn't get seated at the kind of table we would have preferred.  The decor is OK; it not as inviting as we expected.  It seemed unusual to have big screen TVs with sports showing although I was OK with it.   The Sangria was nothing special."}
{"text":"First off, my first experience at Roy's was followed by a 5-star review.  The food, service and atmosphere were all a home-run.  That was the Vegas Roy's, and there, we ate strictly off of the Aloha Menu.  The appetizers were $5 each, and we kept talking about the tasty food for days, even months since our visit.  Here in Phoenix, we decided to try some more food, not from the happy hour special pricing.  I was expecting greater portions, or even sides, but it seems like Roy's is expensive for the sake of being expensive.  One appetizer, one entree, no drinks and our bill was $60.  Let me explain.  We wanted to try the largest appetizer called \"canoe for two\".  The food was rich in flavor as always, but I was surprised that for $30, you only get ten (10) pieces of food. Two ribs, pieces of chicken, shrimp, potstickers and sushi rolls.  Again, only two of each....as in two ribs with a little bit of meat on them, and two pieces of shrimp!  I'm not a \"cheap\" eater, but for $30, I would sure hope for more food than that.  I mean two pieces of a sushi roll? give me a break!  I know this choice is under \"appetizer\", but in today's food world, that doesn't mean \"miniature\"...especially for the price. (funny they don't mention \"2 of each\" on the menu)  The main course was a hanger steak that was cooked nicely with..wait for it, four pieces of sweet potato wedges...small wedges.  No veggies, nothing substantial.  I guess what I'm getting to is this:  Why does it seem like Roy's rations food to an apocalyptic portion?  Is the world out of shrimp, rice or chicken?  Has supply and demand multiplied a hundredfold?  Sure seems that way when dining at Roy's!"}
{"text":"After searching Yelp and Trip Advisor (Roy's is #1 on T.A.), and seeing a salivate-worthy happy hour menu, my wife and I stopped in our first night whilst in Vegas.  We desired selection, so we stuck with only the happy hour appetizers, and ordered four different ones:  Both sushi rolls, lobster pot stickers and the sliders with sweet potato fries.  The food was out of this world!  It completely filled us up for $20 bucks total (not including my $3 beer).  Service was spot on as well.  My wife's Sprite never even reached 1/4 glass before refills...same with our waters.  This is the sort of thing I look for at upscale eateries.  Which is why it deserves a perfect \"5\".  Amazing food, cleanliness and service:  A must visit!"}
{"text":"Roy's is in a beautiful setting. We enjoyed eating out on the patio on a pleasantly cool October evening. Unfortunately the food was not that great. I had Roy's trio with a salad and my husband had the Ahi with a salad. There seemed to be something wrong with every dish: their simple salads were completely one note and salty as can be, the bok choy with the tuna had no flavor except strong mustard, my mahi mahi was the driest I have ever had, the salmon was fine but nothing special, the butterfish would have been delicious except they put a little pico-de-gallo like garnish on top that didn't go at all--I'm still scratching my head over that one. Really I would like to give Roy's 2 1/2 stars for the nice ambience, tasty butterfish, and nice sauce that was served with the dry as a bone mahi mahi, but for the price we paid for mediocre at best food, 2 stars is what they get."}
{"text":"This place was excellent! It was very, very busy, but they got us to a table quickly. Our waiter (despite the noise and crowd, there were a lot of people there) was incredible. So attentive and accommodating. Warm and relaxed ambience. Beautifully decorated. It's not cheap but it is reasonable and it's well worth the quality of food and service you receive. Love this place"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin; this place was AMAZING. The food, the atmosphere, the staff.. everything was perfect when I went to Roy's.   First the staff, they were all so kind with everything; they accommodated my dish for me due to my food allergies. They even surprised us with a printed anniversary paper for my boyfriend and I, because that was our occasion when we went! They were very attentive and welcoming. I ordered the \"Roy's trio\" dish for my entree which included the Salmon, Butterfish, and the Mahi Mahi. They were all so good, especially the Butterfish. That fish was to die for, it was so so so heavenly!! It did not fill me up but it was definitely satisfying. I am planning on getting an appetizer the next time I go.  For dessert, we got the Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé and we finished that in less than 5 minutes!   Definitely would recommend this to my friends, but it's not exactly in the safest area, so if you're having a ladies night, please be careful! Be sure to check out their happy hour, \"Aloha hour\"!"}
{"text":"We ate at Roy's on Valentine's Day 2015.  To our surprise, they didn't have their regular menu, even though there was no mention of a special menu on the website or on Open Table.  The starter that my wife and I both chose was the coconut shrimp.  The flavor was delicious.  My wife's was cooked perfectly.  Mine was dark brown, severely overcooked, and tough.  The clam chowder was not at all a traditional clam chowder, and was delicious, as well.  My butterfish entrée was cooked perfectly, but so oversauced that I had to scrape everything off it to eat it.  The flavor of the sauce literally drowned any butterfish flavor.  My wife's Mahi Mahi tasted \"fishy\" and was tough and hard to chew.  The chocolate soufflé for dessert was excellent.  Service was quite good, after we asked the waiter to slow things down - otherwise, it was rushed, rushed, rushed in an effort to turn tables.  Disappointingly, the ambiance was dreadful - many tables in what was one sparsely decorated large room - as if you were in a convention hall.  We've eaten in Roy's in Pebble Beach, Chicago, and Orlando.  We will go back to those as they were excellent.  We will avoid Roy's Chandler forever.  It wasn't worth eating there and is not worth going back."}
{"text":"The only complaint I have is the check-in 20% did not apply :( which is why we chose the restaurant for our 9 yr Anniversary on 4 July. Otherwise, I enjoyed our waiter Ben. He gave us his undivided attention. Explained the menu in detail. Gave us his recommendations. Great service from Ben. Food was good. I would come back for the hilo roll and Hawaiian Martini cocktail. The lobster was tasty but the shrimp and crab cake did not compare, and the rice with asparagus was subpar. Our key lime tart was delicious exceeding our expectations. The pineapple upside down was just okay. I wouldn't order it again. I loved the restaurant's decor and cleanliness. I would go back.....just have to know what to order, I guess."}
{"text":"Last night me and my hubby spent our second anniversary here.  First of all the service was excellent - if I were just rating that they would get 5 stars.  We got a cute anniversary card, and many of the staff wished us a happy anniversary (they know from the ribbons the hostess puts on the table).  We started with the appetizer canoe and drinks.  The drinks were wonderful - I particularly enjoyed my Roy's Island Mai Tai.  The best item on the appetizer plate was the blackened ahi - we each could have ate a plate of this - the pepper and chinese mustard flavors were what we really enjoyed.  The rest of the items were not bad, but were not great - they were ok.  For dinner I had the shellfish combination - scallops, shrimp and lobster.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and had good flavor.  The sauces on the plate had peanut and spicy flavors and were quite delicious as well.  The shrimp were stuffed - they were too small and overcooked.  The 1/2 lobster tail was a bit small but good, although I was surprised that it wasn't mostly cut out of the tail, so that was a few minutes I had to fight with it.  My hubby had the fish combination - salmon, ahi and butterfish.  He really enjoyed his - particularly the butterfish and the sauce on that one.  He kept putting his rice on that portion of his plate to get that flavor.  The ahi was the same as the appetizer - so he ate that up so fast that he didn't even offer me a bite.  :)  He also enjoyed the salmon.  For dessert, we ordered a pineapple upside down cake.  It was way too sweet for me and not really that special.  Sure it was ok, but not spectacular.  The cake part was pretty flavorless.  It was also served with coconut ice cream, this is normally one of my favorite flavors, but not tonight.  Since it was our anniversary, they also brought us a small piece of a chocolate cake.  This was absolutely divine.  A great chocolate flavor, cooked perfectly.  If we would not have already ordered the pineapple, I would have ordered another one of these."}
{"text":"Both the food and service at Roy's is exceptional.  Even busy as they were when we went, you still got outstanding service.  We had the Lobster appetizers and the Scallops for out main course.  I have never tasted anything so good.  I would highly recommend this place for any occasion.  I felt we received a good value for the money we spent.  Can't say enough good, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are very good and upscale...however I disagree with other reviewers who say they have a great happy hour...There are 5 food items on their Aloha Hour and if you don't like shellfish or beef, the other 2 items are Ahi Tuna and pork short ribs...We sat in the bar and the atmosphere is pleasant and the drinks are a decent price but the food is very very limited...We spent $28 on 2 drinks and 2 appetizers- and we are still hungry...There are other places in the area who offer a better happy hour"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate an early Valentine's Day and to use a gift card I had received at a work event. From the first moment you walk in the atmosphere is set with the dim lighting and decor and it all goes up from there! The service was absolutely fantastic from the initial seating all the way through to getting our check. Tim was our waiter for dinner and his service could not have been better! He explained the menu perfectly and all of his recommendations were divine. We had a great time chatting with him and he definitely added to the positive experience! We ordered the lobster potstickers at his recommendation (10/10), and he so highly spoke of the fish that I ordered the Roy's trio of salmon, butter fish, and mahi mahi and it did not disappoint! Even if you aren't the biggest sea food fan it is so tender with such complex flavors anyone is bound to enjoy, but the non-seafood options are still a hit! My boyfriend ordered the mango pork tenderloin black jack apple bbq and practically wipes the plate clean! While it is a bit expensive, it is 100% worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"When I made the reservation online I noted that it was my boyfriend's birthday.  Most places give you a dessert and that's about it.  Wow did Roy's go out of their way and make him feel extra special.  They had menu's with inserts wishing him a happy birthday in them and ribbon on top.  The waitress mentioned many times it was his birthday as well.  He had the fish trio and enjoyed it and I had the butterfish.  Last time we dined here my boyfriend had ordered it and I don't usually like fish, but this one just melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more so I just had to order it!  It didn't disappoint and he had wished he had ordered the full order as well.  They brought out a plate with a tiny dessert and happy birthday and his name written in chocolate on it.  This is one of our favorite restaurants and we will continue to come here time and time again.  Thank's Roy's!"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for our anniversary dinner.  There is a lot of seafood on the menu, however we don't eat seafood and we're still able to find some delicious options!  the vegetable spring rolls are really good, as well as the truffles bacon Mac and cheese!  My husband ordered the filet and it was cooked perfectly.  I ordered the braided short rib with asparagus instead of the broccolini, it was so tender and flavorful!  The mashed potatoes and asparagus that came with it were good, creamy buttery potatoes and asparagus was tender!  over all we had a great meal and enjoyed our dinner out without our little one..since I have a huge sweet tooth,  have also taken pastry and baking classes, and am a cake decorator for a living I had to try their creme brulee....I was actually very displeased with it, the topping didn't crack when you hit it with the spoon, and the sugar on top was not fully torched so when I took a spoonful you tasted the raw sugar.  very dissatisfied with it, kinda bummed out the end of our meal."}
{"text":"Just one word, disappointing ,,, The sushi appetizers were average; the entrees, while good, where nothing spectacular, and the service left much to be desired. I can accept the mediocre food; but the service was down right weird for a high-end restaurant. I arrived late, after the other 5 in my party had been seated. I ordered a Dirty Vodka Martini ... after 10 minutes the waiter returned to ask me if I wanted that \"neat\" ... duh dude. 10 minutes after that our pre-dinner drinks arrived. My second pre-dinner drink arrived after we were served dinner. I had also ordered a bottle of wine for the table. That arrived 5 minutes after our meals as well- there was simply no sense of continuity in the meal.  If this was Denny's ... I can understand the slip-shot service; but at $30 a plate, I at least expect to have my wine served with my meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently went to Roy's for our anniversary. We read some Yelp reviews before going and because we saw that some people have had issues with the kitchen being slow, we asked our waitress if she could time our plates to be done at a certain time--our babysitter had to be home at a certain time. She accommodated us happily and we were able to fit in an appetizer course, salads, entrees and dessert without being rushed or worrying about the time! She suggested the \"quad\" entree for my husband, and it was delicious and fun to get to have a small portion of four different fish entrees! He liked the salmon and ahi best, Mahi mahi second and black cod butterfish third. I ordered the scallops and they were wonderful!  We ordered the pineapple upside down cake and chocolate soufflé for dessert and they gave us a complimentary lime tart to take home because it was our anniversary! The pineapple upside down cake with macadamia ice cream was really good and memorable! The chocolate soufflé /lava cake was good but similar to what you can get at any nice restaurant--they didn't really put their own spin on it at all. We had a lovely evening!"}
{"text":"Living in Texas the past five years prevented us from visiting our favorite restaurant, Roy's, where we have happily spent many an Anniversary and/or Birthday.  Now back in Phoenix, we went to the Roy's at the Marriott where we have been before.  The food was very good.  My wife had Salmon and thought it was the best she had ever had.  I had the Ono and it was good, if not a bit overcooked.  The service was way, way below par.  Normally at Roy's you are showered with greetings from everyone as you walk to your table.  This night....crickets.  We sat outside and since our last visit (6 years ago), they have formed a large, informal seating area to augment the dining tables.  So, as we are beginning our meal, about 8 people plopped themselves down - all having just come from the pool.  A few were very loud and instantly, Roy's became a Pub.  They ordered pool-side food and the atmosphere was shattered.  Roy's invited this by setting up this seating area.  We finished our meals and the plates sat on the table for nearly 10 minutes as the wait staff disappeared.  This is 180 degrees different from how Roy's used to be.  I spoke with the manager and reminded him that we were there to celebrate my wife's birthday and that we wanted to move indoors to have our dessert and coffee.  They obliged us and were apologetic.   So, all in all, the food remained good, if not overpriced, but the attention, service and outdoor atmosphere took a big bite out of the experience.  Sadly will think twice about returning."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of Roy's and this visit wasn't any different.   Thanks Yelp for the aloha martini!   The hostess Caitlin was really nice and had the doors opened for us as we walked in. My favorite dish is still the butterfish - it was excellent! We tried the yellowtail and it was delicious as well. I would still pick the butterfish over any other fish.   Dessert Pineapple upside down cake - OK, should have had their famous chocolate souffle Coconut butterscotch Bread pudding - Pretty good  The bathroom supplied lotion, hairspray and etc.   Overall service and the dining experience was great."}
{"text":"Roys never disappoints. Tonight I had a shrimp won ton appetizer and Fire rock pale ale. The sauce was slightly spicy but not too much. For the entree it was Crab Dynamite Broiled Barramundi. It came with the rice in the usual Roys fashion,  and baby bok choy. The sauce on the fish was very good. I made the effort to conserve the fish so it would be the final three bites left! Of course for dessert I had that chocolate soufflé and a Justin Obtuse to go with it."}
{"text":"We are regulars at Roy's. Love their Maui Wowie shrimp with avocado salad and disappointed they removed my favorite entree, crab barramundi. My husband loves their one chicken entree--very tender and leeks cooked perfectly. Good for date nights. Great mai tais and aloha hour. I agree with previous reviewer that scallops are great but wish they weren't paired with fatty pork belly."}
{"text":"Roy's was excellent, but I wasn't full-on blown away.  The service is amazing and the food is 4 stars.  My bf took me here as a surprise for date night. We were greeted right away and taken to our table. I ordered a Hawaiian martini, which was a bit too sweet for my taste. For food, we ordered the garlic prawns as an app, and I ordered the Chef's special pork chop and the bf ordered the butterfish.  The pork chop was good, but the noodles were lame, like lo-mein noodles from a cheap Chinese restaurant. The pork chop was also not as tender as I would like. I guess it serves me right to order something that I cook to perfection at home. The butterfish was melt-in-your mouth delicious. It was a very tiny portion though. Luckily for bf, I shared quite a bit of my giant pork chop so he wasn't left hungry.   The garlic prawns were the absolute hit of the night for me. They are actually just normal shrimp that are slightly larger than average and come with this garlic sauce and brussel sprouts. The sauce was delicious and tasted so good on the greens that topped the prawns.   I think for me, the ambiance was a little off because it's a bit more of an old-fashioned older crowd. Also it wasn't very busy. We were in and out of there within an hour. We also had a $25 gift card so the bill wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Went to Roy's for Mothers Day.  Unfortunately the experience was subpar, let's start with the positives.  The edamame every table starts with was tasty, we also ordered the lobster pot stickers and they were excellent, perfectly crunchy but not overcooked and the sauce was great.  For entrees we ordered the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi which came overcooked and desperately needing seasoning.  I returned that dish and received a second attempt, which unfortunately was undercooked and still tasteless :(.   The second entree ordered were the short ribs.  These also came overcooked, chewy but had a slight flavor present...close but no cigar.    My two children had the shrimp sushi roll off the kids menu. Let's just say they were hungry when we returned home.  Bland, tasteless and just all around careless cooking.  Lastly we ordered the chocolate souffle...this was the highlight of the entire meal, very delicious.   I have been to Roys many times before with very satisfactory results, but it seems they have lost their passion and soul.     We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Damn Roy, you are an expensive place, but so worth it!   We try to only save Roy's for special occasions. And, use it as an excuse for that chocolate cake. It's so nice to be able to share a delicious dessert with my gluten-free Husband at a restaurant.   I have never been disappointed by the food or service. Only a little sad everytime that check rolls around."}
{"text":"Wagyu burgers suck, ,they can't get it right. Really terrible because everything else is great. So with this 1 star review, maybe someone will tell the chef's to buy a watch. A fine cut of meat should not be charred! !! 3 times this happened ask your bartenders. So there you have it, overcooked  beef sucks."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing restaurant. The food is top notch. They take normal menu items and put a twist on it. The service has also been amazing every time. Our waiter went over the menu and drink list with us and explained happy hour. While we were there there was also a small band which was very entertaining. I will be back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our first date at Roy's in UTC over 10 years ago. Ever since that first date we moved to PHX and have been going to Roy's ever since. Our favorites are the ribs, ahi poki, Butterfish and of course the lava cake for dessert! We've become regulars over the years because the management, bartenders and servers make us feel like family! We always try new restaurants but we keep coming back week after week because of the level of service and delicious food! It's difficult to get great seafood in AZ.   We seem to always celebrate my birthday here and this year was no exception! Even on an unexpected holiday weekend they seem to accommodate us.   We LOVE you guys at the Chandler location!"}
{"text":"We went here 10 years ago for my husbands 25th bday and had a wonderful experience so we thought it would be fun to go again for his 25thbday. It was .The main dishes were pretty awful. He ordered the filet Mignon and it came out covered in some kind of teriyaki sauce and it said NOTHING on the menu about it being served that way. My steak was sooo bland. The only thing that wAs good was our appetizers. We ordered calamari and the lobster pot stickers which were GREAT! Our waiter was ok until we told him we were unhappy with the main dish and then he was avoiding us. Needless to say we won't be back here and will stick to our absolute favorite steak house which is Morton's."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Roy's all over...IL, AZ, CA,  HI. Since Outback has bought them, the food has denigrated to average to below average to poor. And the waitstaff has become inattentive at best.   Ate at the Roy's in Desert Ridge at the JW Marriott in Phoenix. Sat outside where it was a beautiful evening. Had to ask the waiter for any specials.   Wife and aunt ordered seafood trio of butterfish, mahi mahi and salmon. Butterfish, their signature dish was mushy and tasteless, not dry and flaky. Mahi was dry. Salmon not cooked thoroughly.  I had the scallops. Three sea scallops over something non-descript. Not even any rice or veggies. Delicious, but a small portion for over $30.   Usually, midway during the meal the server asks if anyone wants a lava cake or upside down cake, as it takes time to prepare. This time nothing. After finishing the entrees, server comes over and asks if anyone wants dessert, then omits the upside down cake from the offerings. I had to remind him.   Eaten at Roy's oodles of times before, but now its a very pricey Outback. Awful and won't be returning."}
{"text":"My husband took me to Roy's when we first started dating and I have to say I was blown away by the food and service.  My husband had the Ahi and I swore I'd never take a bite of something that raw, well, it's now a favorite of mine, it melted in my mouth and was so truly amazing. I can't tell you what I had because it's no longer on the menu but it has shrimp- Roy's is classy all the way around ...."}
{"text":"So, we were back at Roy's for our anniversary dinner.  Seems like each time I go here, it gets better!  Had to have a couple of the Hawaiian Martinis again.  They are my favorite.  Again, we started with the Crunchy Golden Lobster Potstickers, the best I have had.  For the main dish I had the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish, which literally melted in my mouth.  Was delicious!  I am usually not one to eat \"everything\" on my plate, but left nothing here.  They had asked us if we were celebrating anything special while they seated us, so we let them know it was our anniversary. They brought out to us a plate of mini desserts to have and offered to take a picture for the occasion.  We also had ordered some dessert.  There was nothing left when we were done and left completely satisfied.  I cannot wait to return for more great food!"}
{"text":"Roy's Aloha Hour was the newest addition this summer to this Asian-Fusion restaurant hailing from Hawai'i.  On Mondays through Fridays, from 4:30 pm to 7 pm, $5 menu items for drinks and food are available.  Of course, when we arrived the past Friday we didn't know about this special hour.  So our dinner reservations (celebrating Restaurant Week) turned into a happy hour feast.  Taking a seat outside to enjoy the warm late summer evening, we looked over the drink menus.  With quite a selection, we began with:    * 1988 \"A tribute to our opening year in Honolulu.  Perfectly balanced blend of tart grapefruit and tangy pomegranate with ABSOLUT Ruby Red Vodka, SOHO Lychee Liqueur and Patron Citronge Liqueur echoes the idyllic island lifestyle.\" (HH $5) - Delicious.  This was the Husband's drink choice and I didn't give it a second thought because it had grapefruit in it.  However, I caught a whiff of the lychee and couldn't resist taking a sip.  It was good, without the bitterness of grapefruit.  For my second drink and his, we both ordered one of these.  * Mango Mojito \"Fresh mango puree blended with Bacardi Limon Rum, hand-squeezed lime juice and freshly muddled mint.\" (HH $5) * Kalua Pork Grilled Cheese Sandwich \"Garlic Parmesan Fries\" (HH $5) - This was my first drink choice and it was decent.  It wasn't as great as the 1988 though.  Food bites:  * Chicken & Shitake Mushroom Lettuce Wraps \"Chili Hoisin Dipping Sauce\" (HH $5) - A generous portion of bibb lettuce leaves and stuffing sat in a three sectioned platter along with the dipping sauce.  It probably could have been presented a bit better.  The lettuce wraps were okay, a bit too sweet though.  The Husband found it to be rather mushy, and I would have to be agree.  Not the highlight from this menu.  * Crispy Mochiko Chicken Bites \"Madras Curry Aioli\" (HH $5) - Served in a bamboo steamer, a generous portion of chicken and dipping sauce arrived.  I was pleasantly surprised by the tasty chicken and the sauce complemented it nicely.    * Spicy Tuna Roll \"Spicy Tuna, Cucumber, Kaiware\" (HH $5) - A simple roll cut into 8 pieces, but very good.  They do their sushi rice well here.  We ordered another one.  * Japanese Shishito Peppers \"Sweet Su Miso Sauce\" (HH $5) - A surprise and delightful find.  We've had this elsewhere, but it was so much better here.  So good we ordered another.  I didn't use the dipping sauce, rather I dipped it back in the sauce it came in.  * Kalua Pork Grilled Cheese Sandwich \"Garlic Parmesan Fries\" (HH $5) - Sliced into two triangles, the sandwich looked exciting from across the table.  Then I noticed the bread, it's a lot thicker and softer, and I prefer it crispier as well.  The shredded cheese wasn't melted all the way, which I think contributed to the lack of gooeyness one expects from a grilled cheese sandwich.  I didn't even notice the pork in the sandwich as a result.  The fries were good though.  Service was okay, not as stellar as I have expected from the Roy's chain though.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Not only does Roy's offer his Prix Fixe menu for $35 most of the year, his restaurants also participate in Restaurant Week!  Cozying up to the chef's counter is one of my favorite things about Roy's restaurants.  Their chef's counter really gives you a bird's eye view of the happenings of the kitchen.  In this experience, we not only engaged with the staff, but watched the dynamics of some errors that happened in the pick-up station.  As we waited for our dinner to begin, the sushi chef offered us an appetizer of shrimp tempura.  This shrimp tempura was perfectly fried, and the tasty miso barbecue (with mustard seed) dressing was very tasty.  It was a great beginning already.  The Restaurant Week prix fixe menu was $30.09.  My mind was on one thing only, which wasn't offered in this prix fixe unfortunately.  So, this is what The Husband got:  * Roy's Appetizer Trio \"Baby Back Ribs, Seared Tiger Shrimp Stick, Crispy Pork & Shrimp Lumpia\" - Shrimp was cooked perfectly, ribs were tasty, and the lumpia was decent too.  * Char Siu Marinated Pork Chop \"Cilantro Scented Forbidden Black Rice, Asian Plum 5-Spice Demiglaze\" - You could smell the char sui sauce as the plate appeared.  The pork chop was moist and tasty.  It was a hearty portion that sat on some Asian greens.  Now I learned my lesson the last time I was at Roy's.  I ordered the Roy's Classic Trio which gives you a sampling of three of their fish dishes. DO NOT ORDER THIS!  Once you get your mouth on the butterfish, you'll wish you ordered that instead.  So I warn you now, just go straight past the Trio, and head for the entree version of the butterfish.  You'll be so glad you did.  And that is exactly what I did!    * Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish \"Chinese Sizzling Soy Vinaigrette\" ($28.95) - The fish is so buttery, literally.  It's so soft and supple and just flakes so nicely.  The dipping sauce is light and just perfect for this fish.  I wasn't digging the rice as much though, I wish I had The Husband's Forbidden Black Rice instead.  Asian greens rest beneath the fish.  * Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle \"Flourless Chocolate Cake with a Molten Center, Raspberry Coulis, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream\" - Yes, this is the dessert to get.  I'm not even the biggest fan of molten chocolate cakes, but I like Roy's version a lot.  He does this dessert so well - so gooey, and sweet, and just yum.  I was thinking that my homemade vanilla ice cream was tasting a bit better than theirs though.  Service this past Sunday evening reflected the kind of service I'm used to and expect from Roy's.  The counter staff really go out of their way to talk to you, and the rest of the staff were friendly and did their job.  They had a large party near us, so we had various staff members throughout the evening and they all reflected what Roy's customer service is all about."}
{"text":"This place is really great! A favorite for my fiancé and I to go on date nights. The ribs are the most amazing ribs I have ever eaten! They are fall off the bone delicious! The Thai chicken and jasmine rice is my favorite meal. And the mashed potatoes, the best I have ever had! Seriously, super yummy food and beautiful atmosphere. I'd definitely recommend this place. Only warning: prices are a little on the high side so this restaurant is more for special occasions."}
{"text":"How can anyone not love Roys?  The service is fabulous, the food top notch. It is beautiful. They have valet parking. We were even more impressed because we got there a little early and it was Happy Hour!  Nothing like a maitai, ahi tuna and kobe sliders to start the night off right!  Not cheap, but all around better than the Strip. There is a reason it's been in Vegas a while - it's that good. A++"}
{"text":"Nice place. Didn't realize it was a chain. PS: listed as a Thai restaurant by Yelp, which it is not!"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is absolutely WONDERFUL! In celebration of my birthday a group of friends and I went to Roy's. A friend made reservations well in advance and when we arrived we were immediately seated. I opened my menu and to my surprise inside the menu was a flyer that was personalized for all the guest in my party wishing me, yours truly, a happy birthday. It was a nice keepsake. At the end of our meal we were also photographed and given the picture in a nice frame to forever capture the event....Anywho...on to the food.  For an appetizer I enjoyed the lobster roll. It was good. The seafood fresh and the presentation awesome.  My girlfriends had salt and pepper calamari and the other had szechuan baby back ribs (these were heavenly).  Main entrees we enjoyed the misoyaki butterfish and it was succulent, moist and melt in your mouth fabulous. My other friend enjoyed the rack of lamb and judging by the bones left on her plate they must have been pretty darn good as well.   Dessert. I had the pineapple upside down cake and my friends had the apple crisp tart and the molten hot chocolate cake...orgasmic...lol  Oh, I forgot the sangria it was Wonderful as well...  This place is awesome. However, if you are looking for a $20 meal this is not your place. Be prepared to spend a little more than average here. It is worth every penny. Appetizers are roughly between $10 -$20. My dinner entree alone was $28.95 and desserts average what appetizers cost. Bring your credit card...lol   I hear happy hour is wonderful with wonderful prices. I will be returning very, very soon."}
{"text":"My quick summary: One of the best places I've been to eat, possible ever.  My husband and I went here last night to celebrate our anniversary.  My husband had made the reservation online.  It was great because it asked if we had any allergies, so he could let them know ahead of time that I'm gluten free.  They also asked if we were celebrating anything special, so he let them know if was our anniversary.  As soon as we walked in the door and let them know our names, they immediately wished us a happy anniversary, and grabbed me a gluten free menu.  When we got to the table we found they had created personal menu inserts, congratulating us on our anniversay, brought us a complimentary glass of champagne, and let us know the chef had prepared for us an anniversary tasting menu (gluten free for me) if we wanted to go off the regular menu.  It was truly memorable.  The tasting menu was amazing, simply amazing.  The started with a shrimp & scallop appetizer.  Scallops are one of my favorite things, and this was cooked perfectly.  They brought us a small plate of steamed edemame, and the seasoning was super delicious.  The next course was ahi tuna poke.  It was a little spicy, but the cucumber and avacado they served it with toned it down and made it perfectly balanced.  We were then served butterfish bites.  I have to say, that is one of the best things I've ever eaten, hands down.  It served with a ginger glaze and a little wasabi.  I could have eaten a whole portion of that.  We also had a small salad of arugala, dates, panchetta, and a white balsamic dressing.  It was so light and refreshing.  All the flavors just exploded in your mouth.  The main course consisted of steak and a half lobster.  The lobster was buttery, delicious, and perfectly cooked.  The steak was served with a red wine ver blanc.  The official dessert was their chocolate souffle, but as a surprise they served a mini dessert for us with chocolate cake and creme brulee.  They decorated the plate to say Happy Anniversay and took a complimentary picture for us.  Those mini desserts were divine.  Then came the souffle, I'd been eager to try it for about a week.  It did not disappoint.  The chocolate was rich, the inside was gooey chocolate goodness.  Between the experience of all the managers & our server catering to our anniversary and the amazing food, my husband and I are guaranteed to become regulars here."}
{"text":"Roy's (8701W Charlston, Summerlin, 702-838-3620) is a QUIETER and less crowded place for wonderful Happy Hour! They serve a variety of delicious sushi dishes and tasty drinks (all for $5 each)!  LONGER Version:  I went there to try out its happy hours three times; twice on Sats and once on a Fri evening.  I was impressed with its nice bar menu, drinks, and attentive, friendly servers, as well as their setup (table cloth in the cozy patio) for happy hour. Roy's has a small and comfortable bar area inside, as well as a patio with table clothed tables outside for HH. All food and drinks are $5. My friends and I really loved their Cabinet Sauvignon (nice Rutherford), seasoned tender fried calamari, beef sliders, and ahi dishes! They are of great value.  Roy's lives up to its reputation for happy hours. So, I was really surprised that on those occasions, this place was NOT crowded - nothing compared with Gordon Biersch or Kona Grill in Boca Park a mile away, which would have been swamed with young people at happy hours. - Therefore, if you enjoy delicious foods and drinks and want to have a QUIETER atmosphere for happy hour, then do give Roy's a try! Parking is easy; it also has valet parking, if needed.  When we were leaving near 7pm, we saw the dinner crowd coming in, and the parking lot was getting busy. SoI guess Roy's might be more famous for their dinners than happy hours. But my friends and I found Roy's happy hour to be among our top choices at any rate, ESPECIALLY WHEN we do NOT want having to fight/wait for a table or parking space, and like to enjoy our good foods, drinks and conversation in a quieter setting. - Peterskis, Dec 2011 Happy Holidays!"}
{"text":"Came here for a one year anniversary. The service was excellent and our server she was really nice and very helpful in choosing what to eat. Place is pretty pricey but the food is worth it. I had the rib eye and it was cooked to perfection and the wife had  The classic four . Make sure call for reservations or you'll be seated at the bar area ."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of people  Very disapppointed but maybe I just have bad luck. There are only 2 things I don't eat: curry and cilantro (don't judge me)  My seafood dish (scallops, shrimp, fish) had curry sauce and it wasn't listed on the menu. Drink that the waiter suggested had cilantro in it and he didnt tell me that while explaining what was in the drink. I didn't want to send anything back because I didn't want to wait for another order to be made. I just ate around the curry and I dealt with the cilantro.  We also felt very rushed the whole time. Service was not good and food was not good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Had dinner here for a friend's bachelor party and they made sure the occasion was memorable. The food is top notice and the prices are very reasonable.  I plan come here each time that I'm in Vegas and would advise anyone to do the same.  Definitely a must do when in town.  Absolutely no negatives to report."}
{"text":"We went to Roy's for a special occasion dinner and started at their Aloha Hour. For $5 each, we got lobster pot stickers (3), Beef Skewers (3 single bites) with Kimchee Cucumber Salad. I had the 1988 with Grapefruit juice, pomegranate and lychee...YUM. My husband had a Mai Tai and wasn't overly thrilled with it. It was all yellow and not overly tasty (just pineappley). We each ordered a glass of wine to take with us for dinner ($5 vs. $15 on the dinner menu...getting it there was much more cost-effective).   The staff was very friendly. They surprisingly got very busy all at once, so there were some delays in service but we were in no rush so didn't mind. The seafood was very tasty. Portions are on the small side though. One item in my seafood sampler was not as it should have been (stuffed shrimp arrived empty!). The waiter asked the chef about it and tried to convince me it was really there but just on the outside which was irritating because it clearly wasn't. So, the chef gave me a blob of stuffing on the side. A little odd, but at least some effort was made to make it right.   The Chocolate souffle is certainly worth the $10.50 and 20 minute prep time. THE BEST.   If you want a little tropical getaway, it's a great place to go. Expect it to be a bit pricey (if not doing Aloha Hour) and portion sizes a little small, but the tastes are very large and worth it and they do make special occasions special!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Vegas. Get out of the casinos (yes, there are great restaurants inside the casinos) and go to Roy's for an awesome experience. Not only they have great food, but friendly service and a lot of attention to details. We had a reservation (OpenTable) and were promptly seated upon arrival. We started with the Ebi Roll, which was very good and some nice drinks as well. After, the Japanese-inspired three-course menu was selected and was fantastic. The chocolate soufflé (which was excellent) was a little dry inside - the waiter noticed that and decided to remove from the check, was it \"was not in the way we should present the dish to the client\"! Come on, such a high level of service, for very fair price. It is a no brainer, go to Roy's and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious! and top-notch service.  I found a special for Roy's on TravelZoo and we decided to check this place out for our anniversary.  When I called to make the reservation, the hostess was super friendly, and asked if we were celebrating a special occasion.  They had an 'Anniversary table' setup for us, and we appreciated the added 'champagne toast' upon being seated.  There was a specific TravelZoo menu, and all options sounded delicious.  We chose the crispy chicken spring rolls as an appetizer, our salads were fresh with a light and tasty citrus dressing.  We shared a grilled, marinated salmon and baked chicken; both were so tasty.  Then we shared the Chocolate Torte w/fresh berries and cream.  All portion sizes were perfect.  The atmosphere was calm & crisp, and definitely clean.  Our server and the host were very attentive.  We will definitely return...that's a big deal for my husband! :-)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite hawaiian fusion restaurant. I love the regular menu and the happy hour menu,. For the regular menu you may want to try to order the  sampler it has 3 types of meats, that will give you a taste of what Roy's is all about. I had my birthday celebration here and they make you feel really special with a special menu greetings for your birthday or whatever occasion it may be. Then a photographer comes to take yoru picture to capture your dining experince,.If you did not want to dine in the regular price menu they have an awesome happy hour menu from 5-8pm half off appetizers, fanging from 2-5 dollars. way awesome to relax after work and chat with your freinds in the lounge. Love this place and would highhly reccomend it!"}
{"text":"Pros:  - Aloha Hour (happy hour) is 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm everyday, not just weekdays - Excellent service  - Good food  Cons: - Pricey - Cookie-cutter chain restaurant"}
{"text":"Ate here about 7 pm on Sun/2 Nov: - Had a $25 coupon that AMEX (American Express) sent me, with the caveat that I couldn't use it on a special (eg the three-course prix-fixe taste of NE Asia option) and so had to be seated in the main dining room. - At the maitre 'd podium, they said I could set anywhere and still use the coupon so I opted for the bar area. - Instead of bread Roy's provides free tasty, exotically salted (with curry powder?) edamame at the start of your meal.  I went with the $36(?) Roy's three-fish entree: mahi mahi (ok), salmon (good), butterfish (awesome), which came with a side of steamed white rice (I didn't ask if I could have brown rice).  Since it was NFL night the Aloha (happy) Hour bar bites was in effect all night, so I also got a $9 (normally $15) wagyu burger.  It was good, but of the three massive onion rings on the side - I could barely finish one because the breading/batter had bits which were really hard to chew.  - Nico, my server, was great. - I miss the Roy's on Charleston in Summerlin (it closed down I think earlier this year), but this place is a suitable replacement."}
{"text":"I was looking for a special place in Yelp to treat my beautiful fiancee for a nice birthday when I come accross Roys. So, I made the reservation online and arrived on time.   We were greeted by a nice host that congratulate my fiancee on her birthday. A terminator looking server that seems to just wanna get over the order and get the heck out of a way.    The food was fantastic thought the cakes is too small, I prefer the tao restaurant when it comes to birthday cake, they really go all out.   All and all, everything was alright and we enjoy our meals."}
{"text":"Awesome service awesome food without the $$$$ price.  The staff were incredibly nice, even taking our photo with the house camera and giving us a blown up picture for free.  Food - well............................ lets just say delicious, delicate, unctuous, without being hoity toity.  The type of food that you take that first bite of, keep it in your mouth and close your eyes to give your mouth the time it needs to comprehend it all.  The type of food where you immediately say............... \"you gotta taste this\".   Order fish.  Any kind.  Just order it.  You'll thank me."}
{"text":"Roy's has been a staple for us when it comes to fulfilling our need for fresh seafood. This last round was extremely surprising as the food simply did not taste fresh. The \"butterfish\" did not have the exceptional texture or taste that we had grown accustom to. We may have just hit them on a bad night and we will head back soon to see if this was just an anomaly."}
{"text":"This is based on a happy hour review, and the food (ribs and lobster potstickers specifically) were excellent - better than I was expecting. The bartender was a little rude, maybe just aloof...but definitely not put together. I don't understand why management wouldn't want their bartenders to look presentable especially when working at a nicer restaurant. Does it really take a lot of effort to brush your hair or put on a little makeup..she looked like she just rolled out of bed to go serve her local dive bar. Makes me feel like I'm at some hole in the wall place. Didn't help that another bartender or server who was tabbing someone out in front of me put the persons credit card in his MOUTH while he messed with the screen. Come on, seriously.   Besides that the ambiance was fine, I sat at the bar on a Friday and while it was busy, you could still get a seat pretty quick. The ribs for $7 happy hour price were AMAZING. You get 4 and they slide right off the bone. Can't say enough good things about them and everyone was ordering them. The lobster potstickers were sooo good too, definitely will order again. We also tried the mac and cheese (didn't like them - it was more noodles with not enough flavor or cheese), and the crab fried rice (I liked there were big pieces of crab in them, would probably get again).  It's a good place to try, I'd like to go back for their full dinner menu."}
{"text":"I have driven by Roy's numerous times and wondered if the Hawaiian fusion was something I would like to try considering that spam musubi was my favorite Hawaiian cuisine.   The opportunity to eat at the restaurant came after my team at work won a contest and the reward was a dinner at Roy's.    I was pleased with delicious canoe appetizer that featured Szechan Baby Back Ribs that were so tender they fell off the bone, Blackened Ahi that prepared you for a little more, Crispy Spicy Tuna Roll (it was alright).  However, the Lobster Potstickers with sauce made me want to ask for more.    For an entree, I had the Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi in Lobster Butter sauce with asparagus and red potatoes. The portion size was perfect and although I am not a fan of macadamia nuts, this dish didn't have too much and so I enjoyed it.  Desert was fabulous too with a trio of delights. I had a teeny tiny chocolate covered cheese cake-sicle on a tooth pick, a delicious brownie and an itty-bitty strawberry cake.    At the end of the evening, I had a cup of coffee to call it a night!    I recommend this restuarant for its ambiance and for a sophisticated night out on the town.  If you want to impress your date, this would be the place.  D"}
{"text":"Overall the place was good especially for the price, not the best food in Vegas. The crispy wrapped filet and udon noodles were great appetizers. Veggie spring rolls are what you would expect. I got the short rib for dinner and was good, very tender didn't need a knife to cut it. I thought it didn't have much flavor though. The soufflé was awesome, a must have!! The service was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"The food and service here are both excellent. Prices are about middle of the road for Vegas, so there's value here you won't find in other big-name restaurants in town.  The Aloha Roll was enormous and absolutely delicious. Amazed it was only $12. I had the filet / shrimp combo it was delicious. Their mojito's were great too. We finished with the deconstructed cheesecake which was creative, and tasted good.  Excellent service. The waiter was friendly and extremely attentive. As we were winding down they asked if they could call a cab for us. When it arrived they led us from the table to the front and held both doors open for us on the way out. I've never been to a restaurant that did that before. A+"}
{"text":"Overall very tasty and the ambiance was nice.  The fillet and lobster was cooked perfectly. My dynamite ono dish was super yummy and the trio was ok as well. A bit less spectacular as the first two dishes, but still tasty. The lobster potstickers were OK... Can't really tell the lobster part, so not very worth it. The calamari was OK, too... but it had this weird mushiness texture in the inside that I've never had with other calamari dishes.   The wait staff was super attentive... The food took about 25 minutes to come out after we got our appetizers.   It was my mom's birthday, so they provided a yummy chocolate mini dessert.  At the end of the dining experience, we found a spider that had drowned in my dad's water cup. We didn't complain about it though because we figured it may have landed in there recently... or at least we hope it was just recently. Never can anticipate when and where you'll find spiders...."}
{"text":"Been here about 4 times. Food is always stellar. I got the crab dynamite with boiled barramundi. Had large pieces of bok choy that were good, but semi difficult to eat because it was just like a whole half chunk of bok choy all together. Also had a fancy little carrot that was still super crunchy and ginger rice that was tasty, but a little cold...  Also tried a couple pieces of the ribeye. Very flavorful! And macadamian but crusted mahi mahi, which was good but not as flavorful as my dish or the ribeye.   Wait staff is typically great, but today's girl never smiled. Wasnt friendly. Just took our order. Did her thing."}
{"text":"Had to write another round of kudos for this great chain.   One might think that now being affiliated with the Outback Steakhouse Group would diminish it's dedication to quality - WRONG. The chef, the people, the quality and service.. ALL THERE. And.... it's not just Sushi :-)  I've written about this and other locations before but the consistency is there and it's always a great experience. This time it was the perfect night to sit on the patio and enjoy a couple drinks, some wine, a great dinner and great AZ weather.  The hanger steak was perfect, but what has always made Roy's the tasty experience you want is.. the sauces. They must have spent decades (OK maybe hours) making these sauces that add so much to everything they serve.  With that in mind, the Asian pork ribs for an appetizer were THE BEST. When i was in San Diego a few weeks ago we ate there and they were nice enough to make the appetizer portion into a dinner for me - WOW... i love those ribs. My client had the crusted Mahi Mahi (also my dad's fav) and it didn't disappoint - cooked perfect and again, the sauce reduced enough for flavor but didn't overwhelm.  The drinks are great, even their own house wines are good for the price. (Hey, after a couple great Mai Tais who needs a $20 glass of wine?)  The only issue this trip was that the Chocolate Souffle lacked that yummy runny explosion of chocolate sauce when you break it open BUT... seeing that, our waiter insisted on a new one for us. Hence.... 5 stars.  The service was professional and knowledgeable as usual and it's a pleasure to go somewhere once in a while where the waiters aren't \"almost helping you\" in between texts and meaningless chatter with the dishwasher.  Their reservation system actually works and automatically applies any promotional discounts to your bill. Nice to see efficiency.  Bravo again to Roy and his well trained people and well conceived concept. Try any of their locations and there's a 99.8% chance you won't be disappointed.  How do you say Bon Appetite in Hawaiian? (Roy's i guess)  http://www.roysrestaurant.com/index.asp   (PS - I don't work there... I just love the place)  :-)"}
{"text":"The food was on par for the price point. The server was good, but didn't seem to know the menu. The real point that made things sour was how management treated our table. Maybe they are used to the \"locall crowd\". I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!!  We had our Dinner Rehearsal here!!   I have to say the staff that handled or served us were amazing.  Our party (50 at least)..yep big group were satisfied.   We had the custom dinner menu  .For our appetizer , we had the Family Style Canoe (Lobster Potstickers, Tempura Crusted Ahi Sushi Roll, Szechuan Spiced Baby Back Ribs, Blackened Island Ahi)..all I can say is they were so good..the one that stood out for me was the Szechuan Spiced Baby Back Ribs...they were damn tasty!!!   For salad we had the one that's called Sweet Home Waimanalo Salad Dean Okimoto's Creamy Herb Dressing....that creamy herb dressing was the BOMB.  For our main entree..each guest had a choice of  Hibachi Grilled Salmon with Japanese Citrus Ponzu ;Tender Braised Beef Short Ribs with Mashed Potatoes, Broccolini in Garlic Butter ; Pan Roasted Chicken Breast  with Herb & Garlic Chicken Jus....and there's another one...I forgot what it was...I chose the Pan Roasted Chicken..the chicken was moist and tender...the other dish looked good too!!!  The Hibachi Grilled Salmon that my son chose was excellent (I should have picked that) ..As for the dessert, it was a dessert sampler plate...very small but very good =)  I felt that the main highlight of our dinner was Roy's Restaurant Staff...they all made us feel Special =)"}
{"text":"First of all I have to say that I was here a few weeks back as part of a company dinner event with clients, and we were seated in a private party room with a pre-fix menu, so this review is based on that.  Now, I have to admit that the food is quite good here, and worthy of the many glowing reviews being bandied about.  We started with a \"Family Style Canoe\" which featured crunchy golden style lobster potstickers, sesame seared shrimp, grilled Szechuan pork ribs, and blackened island ahi. Everything on this appetizer boat was very good, but the ribs were absolutely amazing! I pretty much scoffed down all four ribs that were on the plate - sorry everyone who didn't get one!  \"Sweet Home Waimanato Salad was next. It came with a creamy herb dressing. As far as salads go it was just ok and pretty standard.   There were four plates offered as entrees. As a main entree I ordered the \"Hibachi Grilled Salmon\" which came with a Japanese citrus ponzu. The salmon was prepared perfectly, and was a great choice for one trying to eat healthy while on the road.  Of course, it's not all about having no fun, as I had to try the \"Dessert Sampler Plate\". Each plate came with three mini desserts. Yeah, I ate all three. Can't remember much of what they were, maybe a cheesecake thing, and a chocolate thing, but all were eaten happily.  The staff here is on-point. Everyone I encountered were more than helpful and highly courteous. Our room was nicely appointed and they even had a special menu printed up for our company event which added a personal touch.   Must definitely book a meal here next time in Vegas on a vacation to check out what a regular dinner is like. Great spot off the strip!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I never got around to writing this review.  I have been here a few times, including Mother's Day Prix fix.  The atmosphere here is very inviting and warm.  It is an excellent setting for date night or for special occasions, and the service has always been exceptional.  Rarely do I tip the busperson above and beyond the waiter, but I usually drop a few bucks directly to them for their assistance with the dinner here at Roy's.  They really go above and beyond making sure you need nothing.  The food is always great....I have had some very very good dishes here, but what they excel in IMO, is seafood.  Roy's has some of the best tasting fish dishes I have consumed, and has prepared me my most favorite Sea Scallops to date!   Whether it is full fillet of fish or shrimp and scallop dishes, you can't go wrong!  Only thing that is a bummer is the prices...seems like I never leave here without spending over $200+ with tip and drinks for two, but I always leave with a smile on my face and a memorable food journey, so I will continue coming!"}
{"text":"Roy's is absolutely one of the best restaurants in town no matter what way you slice it.  Prices:  Extremely competitive prices, not typical of what you find on or near the strip.  Food:  We had a party of 7 and I didn't hear one issue from anyone throughout the entire meal.  The consensus favorite dish might have been the Butterfish.  However, I substituted the Ahi for the Salmon in the Trio, and I will say that I'm not sure I could pick between the Mahi Mahi, Ahi, and Butterfish...they were all excellent.  Service:  Our waiter (Melvin I believe) was great.  Upbeat, enthusiastic, clear, and very knowledgable and accommodating.    Furthermore, their Birthday service exceeded expectations.  Each menu featured a special page with my wife's name on it.  They later presented her with a copy to take hope tied with a bow.  Later in the meal they took a family photo with their camera as well as several camera phones.  They brought a printed and framed version to take home shortly after.  Lastly, they brought out a special birthday dessert with my wife's name and \"Happy Birthday\" written on the plate (chocolate sauce I believe).  All in all I felt like Roy's offers tremendous value.  I think you would be hard pressed to find better quality food at these prices (or any price for that matter).  We will definitely be back to Roy's"}
{"text":"We went to Roy's for my birthday on Sunday, May 1st.  I made a reservation online and the online form asked if there was a special occasion, so I entered that it was my birthday and it asked for my name... when we got to the restaurant they had personalized the menu's with a welcome and happy birthday page which was beautiful and a really nice surprise.  Each of us (me, my husband and two teenagers) had something different and everything was delicious.  They also brought a complimentary birthday dessert as well as took a group photo and delivered it to us in a frame.  The birthday desserts as well as the chocolate lava cake and the pineapple upside down cake were a perfect way to complete a wonderful evening.  I really would recommend Roy's for any special occasion."}
{"text":"Great Pineapple Martini and some other fruity drink that Larry the bartender made us. Larry was such an awesome bartended we decided to eat at the bar. The calamari was so so, good not great. We tried some Blacked Ahi, salad, chocolate soufflé with some port...All were excellent. I enjoyed our stay very much!"}
{"text":"Great Ahi. I love just getting a drink and app, well maybe a dessert as well. Always Yummy."}
{"text":"Ordered two dish dishes and both were amazing. It was very tender and perfectly cooked and seasoned. Atmosphere was very classy."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Kim is wonderful always so attentive. And the food is excellent! You can't go wrong with their soufflé!  They even gave us a free photo and complementary dessert for our anniversary"}
{"text":"We went here tonight for our first time. The service was excellent. The drinks were good. The appetizers were over the top delicious as well as our entrees. Even our dessert, which was given to us for celebrating our anniversary was delicious. Would return for a birthday or other celebration. Thank you Tim for you service."}
{"text":"I have been to several Roy's ,at different locations, this one is far better than the one at the JW Marriott.  Service and food were top notch -- they even switched chairs for my elderly visiting parents, to make them more comfortable.     Well done job on all counts for this location!"}
{"text":"We always try to go to Roy's This one is within the Marriott Desert Ridge resort. Great local chef selection menu and the regular menu. Great sites on the property. Great service"}
{"text":"We went to for a date night.  Sadly enough, being born and raised in Hawaii, I never got around to going to any of the Roy's restaurants.  I guess when you've got so many different choices for Hawaiian fusion food, I never got around to it.  I ended up with the winter pre fixe for $35 choosing: Rock Shrimp Tempura (Shishito, Shimeji, Malaysian Curry Aioli), Tender Braised Beef Short Ribs (Creamy Mashed Potatoes, Natural Braising Sauce), and for dessert, Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé.  They were all very excellent choices.  The shrimp tempura is cut into bite-sized pieces and tossed in the sauce.  It was a touch sweet, but still crunchy and very yummy.  The short ribs were super tender (no need for a knife) and very tasty.  It did remind me a bit of a homemade pot roast.  I split the dessert with my husband which was a good choice because it was really rich.  It came with vanilla ice cream and a raspberry sauce on the side.  The hubby started with the The Original Hawaiian Martini (in classic Hawaiian fashion, our Maui pineapples are drenched in SKYY Vodka, Stoli Vanil Vodka and Malibu Coconut Rum. Shaken and served with fresh pineapple) and really enjoyed it.  He said all the flavors mixed together really well and it was a very smooth drink.  Later on he also tried Roy's Island Mai Tai (a 1940's classic with a contemporary twist. A sweet blend of Castillo White Rum, fresh pineapple, orange curacao and Myers Dark Rum for a flavor found only at Roy's).  He enjoyed this one also but preferred the martini just a bit more.  He said the mai tai had a bit of a bite to it.  For dinner, he started with the Crispy Karaage Calamari (Yuzu Aioli & Thai Basil Almond Pesto).  They were very lightly breaded and had the 'o's and baby squid tentacles in the mix.  I enjoyed the yuzu sauce while the hubby preferred the pesto.  The pesto made me think Italian restaurant, not Asian.  As a main course he decided (with some prodding from me) on the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish (Hong Kong Sizzling Peanut Oil & Soy Vinaigrette).  I didn't get to taste it (one of the few times he didn't share a bite) but he loved it.  He even ate super slow to try to make it last longer.  Overall, the service was very quick and friendly.  My husband was wearing black and instead of the white napkins on the table, they offered him a black one so he wouldn't get white lint on his clothes.  He felt very fancy.  All the food came out very quickly and always piping hot.  We thought it was great and will probably make another trip back sometime in the future."}
{"text":"I had the Misoyaki \"Butterfish\" (Black Alaskan Cod) about 4ish years ago here. It was a pretty big portion for the price which is always a big plus especially in Vegas. I'm now writing this review because I just had the Alaskan Cod at Table 10 in the Venetian Hotel which was pretty good but not as amazing as I remember Roy's Cod to be. It melted like well... Butter. I literally still think about that fish every time I eat cod now."}
{"text":"This is a great place to celebrate a special occasion.  When you make the reservation--warm, wonderful people greet you, specifically Catherine and Lynn!!!!    I don't want to spoil the surprises for the special occasions, but it is above and beyond what restaurants normally do.       The food was wonderful, and the restaurant is TOTALLY committed to your satisfaction.  This is a classy operation.  And the people make it that  much better.      I would love to see this location update its surroundings to match the one in Newport Beach, but that's my only suggestion.  Thank you to all the wonderful people who made our dinner so special."}
{"text":"Get there at 4:30 for the happy hour...the menu is not as good as I thought.... Order a couple drinks and two dish from the happy hour menu and get another combo appetizer.....the food is just fine but the severs are great... I have been to the one in AZ...the food is better over there....wondering WHY? :("}
{"text":"If I could give this place ten stars, I would! Everything about this experience was perfect!  It was mine and my wife's 4 year anniversary and so I made reservations here for 7pm on Friday. When we arrived, we were greeted by multiple friendly employees and I believe even the manager, who was walking around to make sure things were running smoothly, it seemed! We got walked to our table and were soon greeted by our server Eric. He was so kind, and so friendly. He made sure we were taken care of!  We started off with the Sunshine sushi and omg! Tempora, yellowtail, salmon, avocado, rice cooked to perfection, YUM! It was the best sushi roll I've ever had in Arizona! My entree was the shrimp and fried rice and my wife got the braised beef. Each dish was incredibly delicious. The shrimp was fresh, juicy, and plump. The beef melted in your mouth! The entrees did not disappoint! Last, the dessert was pineapple upside down cake and oh my... Let's just say that was gone QUICK!    Overall, if you have a nice occasion and want to eat well, choose Roy's. It was one of the most pleasant experiences we've had and we can confidently say we'll be back!   A side note though, it is more on the fancy side so I was surprised to see people in T-shirts and flip flops.... Cmon people! It's fun to get dressed up every once in a while. Let's keep it classy!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Roy's in several different locations (New York, Philadelphia, Hawai'i) and I pretty much know what to expect and I had high expectations since the other locations were always very good.  This location did not disappoint but I do have one major complaint.  The service was good.  The hostess that greeted us was friendly, but one of the waiters was hanging out around the hostess stand flirting with them and quite frankly was annoying them and me.  Our waitress was friendly and efficient (she was not the red headed monster as some reviewers previously described).  The food was typical Roy's - very good.  I had the butterfish (of course) and it was excellent.  The portion was a bit small however and left me wanting more.  My wife's scallops were good, but she was a bit disappointment with them - a tad bit too overcooked.  We sat outside and it was perfect weather.  The lighting was very poor but they did give us little flashlights to read the menu by.  The major complaint I have is that this location is overpriced.  While I understand that you are paying a premium because of the \"Roy's\" name, I found the pricing way out of line for a restaurant in Phoenix.  The pricing was more in line with a New York or San Francisco.  Not cool and I would not go back to this location for this reason.   I'd give it 3 1/2 Stars if I could.   The Marriott Hotel that the restaurant is inside is stunning by the way.  I definitely recommend staying there."}
{"text":"Service was unacceptable given that it was not very crowded. It started with the person that sat us, he put us right next to a family of four even though there were many open tables. From there it went down hill!"}
{"text":"We came here for our 2nd anniversary. It was delicious and nice. We caught happy hour and had some poke and sake in the bar.   Everything looked good so we tried a bunch! We really liked the lobster dumplings, the lobster bisque, and more poke...   I really liked the butterfish, but it was almost too saucy. We also loved the chocolate souffle!   Service was great! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had not been in for awhile sick it can get pricey.  Found a Groupon and took advantage of it.  Now I remember why we liked the place so much.  Excellent service and great food.   Note the Groupon is for a special prefix menu so the options are a small but the flavor was full."}
{"text":"melon salad needed a little salt to bring out the flavor, if you don't have salt on the table you need to get it right,  had the fish trio the portions of ahi and butter fish were very small the salmon was a bit bigger, all were cooked correctly and tasted good, the rice was served on a seperate plate which made mixing with the sauces akward, the bok choy side consisted of one leaf, must be running low.  Dessert was ok they did a great job making scratch creme brulee taste like instant and the pineapple thingy was the high light of the evening, if I was headed home from a winning time at the casino and my car broke down out front I would think about stopping in for a bite"}
{"text":"Went for HH. The staff was friendly. Nice atmosphere. The drinks were wonderful. The mahi tacos were good, but a little bland. The ahi roll was delicious though!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, the wine was good. HOWEVER, the menu said that we'd get a 2014 bottle of Chardonnay and instead we got a 2016 bottle of said wine. (See photos for reference). This has happened to us in the past at other \"higher end/specialty\" restaurants and it just seems sort of SHADY. Honesty says all you need to know about a reputable establishment. I'm disappointed and not likely to return to Roy's."}
{"text":"What a perfect meal! We were seated right away and greeted by our server, Edmund, who could not have been more charming and informative. We ordered two Hawaiian Martinis - perfect balance of pineapple, vanilla, and coconut. Off to a great start with the martinis and the appetizer assortment that included ginger chicken, lobster potstickers, Szechuan ribs, shrimp and spicy tuna rolls. All of it delicious! I ordered the Misoyaki Butterfish for my main course. OMG! I can see why this fish got this name as it practically melts in your mouth. So delicious with the spicy vinaigrette! The meal was finished off with a delicious coconut tres leches cake. You could hardly taste any coconut, but it was tasty anyway! The wine list was excellent and we had a wonderful pinot grigio with our main course, as well two great dessert wines. This restaurant is a great choice if you want something a little more exotic (Hawaiian fusion) or if the chaos of the Strip is starting to get a little too much. There is a good reason why Roy's is currently ranked one of the best restaurants in Vegas. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"WOW....that's all I can say....I've been here a few times now and each time it just gets better. I brought 2 of my out of town business associates to dinner last night....one is a strict vegan. He was shocked at how many vegetarian dishes they offered. He said it was the most of any restaurant he's been too that's not a vegan specific restaurant. The best part for him was when they said could adapt any of the vegetarian dishes to be completely vegan. The meal he had was, as he put it \"the best I've had since turning vegan 2 years ago\". He loved it and was excited when I told him there was a Roy's in So-Cal near where he lived.   I personally had the Roys trio...the portion size was perfect for a \"sampler\" meal. But the flavors were out of this world. Man was It great. Service was excellent and the entire meal was very enjoyable. Even the drinks were a strong pour and very good. I'll be back often."}
{"text":"I actually enjoy going here....My kids like it also.  My kids get the short rib.  You should get it here also.....  Go during happy hour, I personally love the Kona beer and lower prices on the happy hour menu.  Great outdoor seating, when its not 100+.  The servers are excellent and we almost where going to the point the servers remembered us?  Happy hour prices with excellent food.  Lobster potstickers, Kona beer, and maybe some tuna tartar for lunch?  great refreshing ambience and great food. Can't get Lobster potstickers anywhere else I have been thus far.....  I had to give it 5 stars, because I have gone here so many times......great food always brings me back...."}
{"text":"Roy's turned out to be a good choice for dining while staying at the JW Marriott, but I'm unsure if I  would venture out here otherwise. We came here for dinner and enjoyed an excellent bottle of German Riesling to accompany the Hawaiian ahi poke, which was good but nothing incredible. The lobster roll we ordered also was quite underwhelming, ranking as below average sushi in my opinion. Roy's definitely ended the evening with a high note with the warm chocolate soufflé and the pineapple upside-down cake, I really enjoyed both of these desserts. Overall, it was a nice evening, but I think the experience fell a little short of our high expectations."}
{"text":"Amazing food but horrible service. The waitress and manager were both extremely rude to my table and did not take ownership for any of their mistakes.  Will not go to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Fresh seafood and great dishes. You can't go wrong with Hawaiian Japanese fusion. Presentation and plating of each dish was a piece of art. Melt in your mouth sushi and excellent service.   All I have to say is CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE............WOW!!!!"}
{"text":"We usually dine at the Roy's at Desert Ridge. However, since we stayed at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass, we tried the Roy's in Chandler. As far as ambiance, the Desert Ridge location is better since it is located in a resort and their patio seating makes you feel like you are in Hawaii (think palm trees and tiki torches) The Roy's in Chandler location is located in a mall area. The food and the service at the Chandler location were excellent. I got my usual which is the Ahi and hot chocolate souffle. Everything was delicious. We were celebrating some birthdays and the staff made us feel special with birthday desserts and a group picture. Would definitely return if we are in the area again. Rating 4 stars instead of 5 just because of the mall location. We have dined at many other Roy's restaurants all over the country. Many other Roy's locations have great views, this one does not."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Definitely recommend this place!!! The calamari is phenomenal and the sushi rolls are amazing!! The people are very nice and service is great!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service! John our server made our anniversary very special covered the table in Flowers and a free dessert and photo! Great dishes, VERY GREAT fresh Hawaiian cocktails and again exceptional service! Well be back soon for what looked like a great daily happy hour!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to eating at restaurants owned by famous chefs there is a chance of being let down. Maybe it's the high expectations, the even higher prices, or just the wait that comes with going to a high profile restaurant.  I'm pleased to say that this time the experience matched the expectations and I had one of the best meals I have had in years.   My mother is in town from Oklahoma and we sat on the patio and with the weather starting to cool was great. There was a fire pit, many torches, and a guy playing acoustic guitar which set a nice relaxing atmosphere.   We had the bento box, and the California roll for appetizers. the roll was good and the crab meat was fresh. but the bento box was great. It has braised short ribs, pot stickers, a couple pieces of spicy tuna roll and shrimp skewers. The ribs had a nice balance of teriyaki and smoke and came right off the bone and were delicious.   My mom got the butter fish and I had the Roy's trio which had butter fish, salmon, and tuna. All three fish were excellent and well seasoned but that butter fish was amazing. It was my first time to have the fish and it was buttery, had zero fishy taste and was just delicious.   for dessert we shared the blueberry tart with lavender ice cream. Again, just great. the blueberries were ripe, the ice cream was creamy and refreshing, and the presentation was superb.   in conclusion, i have nothing bad to say about Roy's. I think if I had to use a word to describe the food it would be balance. Everything plays well off of each other.   My mother said it was the best meal she has had in years and I have to agree. The bar was set high, but Roy's knocked it out of the park."}
{"text":"Being from the East Coast I hadn't heard of Roy's Fusion.  I am all about Fusion food, but really didn't find it to fusion-y.  The wait staff was very attentive but he spoke so fast that I couldn't understand him.  We were a large party so we ordered the \"boat\" of mixed appetizers.  This was like a glorified pupu platter of the crummy Chinese/Polynesian variety.  The spare ribs were moist and  tender, nothing bad there but not over the top, the potstickers seemed like they came out of a frozen bag and were steamed once again underwhelming, the ahi tuna sucked.  Was over cooked and should have been served sashimi style and the roll was not as good as what I can score at Wegman's.  Instead of salad I opted for the clams in sizzling soy sauce.  Now for the kicker...Roy's serves NO BREAD...The sauces would have been nice to have something to dip.  upon request they did produce a banana leaf roll of steamed rice (they took  off the leaf...think it would have presented better with a few of them on a plate tied up malay/philippine style.  The clams and the chorizo were awesome...wish I could have ordered a mammoth plate of those instead of the butter fish I ordered.    If you have lived near the pacific and/or visited Japan you most likely would  have encountered the butterfish.  It is a slender fish that yields small tasty filets.  Typically a meal is 4 or 5 of them either sashimi'd or fileted and broiled or grilled.  I am not sure what I got was butterfish.  I do know that it was to come in a sizzling soy vinagrette (it did) and was served over asparagus and  bok choy.  The fish was totally overcooked and  the presentation was  just not that attractive.  for the 32.95 it cost I thought it was wayyyy overpriced.  Last but not least we shared desserts which were the mousse and the pineapple upside down cake with vanilla ice cream...should have went straight for a  dessert drink...these were overpriced and ridiculous as well.  I'm thinking I won't be back and am really glad I wasn't paying for it.  Trader Vic's used to be more fun and just as good.  Sorry Roy Yamaguchi the place doesn't fly."}
{"text":"Roy's is a great mix of pristine sushi,  steakhouse and wine. Try the kalamari appitizer and be amazed."}
{"text":"I've been to Roy's in HI, FL, CA and NV and they always consistently hit the mark.  I was here last week which happened to coincide with my birthday and the extra attention they gave was awesome, from the custom birthday insert in the menu, a photo of the occasion and a little dessert surprise. 5 Stars all the way!  The Hawaiian Martini is always a favorite.  All the food was great, the dressing on the pear salad was a little too tart, but not worth a ding on the review."}
{"text":"We had high expectation for this place came highly recommended by friends.  Maybe it was us, we have been going all out in Vegas eating amazing food and this place was just ok.   First its not on the strip, our taxi driver got lost and dropped us off at the wrong restaurant.  Finally when we arrived, we were seated instantly I had reservations.  The place was modern with a touch of Island.  It was Saturday night so it was busy.  Roy's is known for Hawaiian fusion, back home doesn't have any Hawaiian restaurants at all so this was exciting to try.    We started with some sushi, several rolls and I must admit this was the highlight of our entire meal.  Sorry tried to look it up for description on their online menu but could not find it possibly a special that night.  For our main dishes we all decided on getting Roy's Trio which included Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Misoyaki Butterfish, and Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi.  It seemed like the best choice.  They are known for their Butterfish, and reading the reviews it seems highly recommend.  But I also wanted mahi mahi.  When we received our food it was nicely presented in a plate with three divisions.  I was really looking forward to the Butterfish but the mahi mahi was my favorite out of the three fishes but overall it was ok to me.  I was looking for more flavors, it was missing something.  The fish was all nicely cooked though.  We shared spicy Korean chili fried rice and Szechwan style green beans.  The rice was tasty and the beans were ok, I've had better.   We ended not getting dessert our server seems to be shocked by this and so were we but since we weren't blown away but the food we decided to get our bill and have dessert elsewhere.   The service was good, our server and other helpers seem to be very attentive.   Overall is was an ok experience we just had higher expectations if I could give it 2 1/2 stars I would."}
{"text":"Eat here from time to time & tonight came for the Butterfish. Two bites into my husband and I's meal ( we both got the Butterfish ) and we see charcoal all over the bottom underneath our fish. They did remake it for me, but then it was loaded with sauce on the side& missing the richer sauce on the top. $160 for 2 of us, snd I am not impressed this time. I also ordered a jalapeno margarita & they always come with the jalapeno garnish instead, this one came without. My favorite part is the jalapeño.  All in all they came & took $20 off our bill. Huh?!?"}
{"text":"OMG!!! * Terrific service * Excellent food * A great birthday experience!   It definitely lived up to all the rave reviews.  We would recommend Roy's highly.  Greeting - 5 stars  The hosts acknowledged my birthday immediately and they provided several menu selections, including vegetarian and gluten-free.  Service - 5 stars (and this is from very picky people) The server told us he was going to help make it a perfect meal, and he did!  Both he and busser made sure everything was right, repeatedly.  Even took a photo, which arrived later with a frame.  Food - 5 stars + (see detail below:)  Auntie Lei's Aloha Roll (Spicy Tuna Roll) - 5.7 stars Extremely fresh & tasty.  We were forewarned by our server that is was spicy... and it was, with an incredible burn (maybe too much for others, but we loved it.) The roll was great and SO flavorful; wasabi horseradish and ginger were not required!  Rock Shrimp & Peaches - 5.9 stars A surprisingly awesome combination!  Not only exceeded our expectations, but also we would order again in heartbeat.  The shrimp was perfect, the peaches picked at the peak of ripeness.  Ahi Poke - 5.2 stars Super fresh Ahi that melted in your mouth.  A bit heavy on the sesame oil, which we only noticed because the Rock Shrimp was so light and refreshing.  Porcini Dusted Hangar Steak - 5.3 stars with Creamed Collards, Crispy Onion Rings, Asian A-1 Prepared like a long tenderloin, with perfect searing.  The meat was a touch more rare than medium rare, but it tasted great.  Their Asian A-1 was good too.  The collards, although rich, went with the steak quite well.  The onions rings... TO DIE FOR!  Butterfish - 5.9 stars How do they do it!?!   We've cooked ourselves at home and ordered Butterfish before out and this was \"Out of this World\" experience.  An amazing charred-caramelized searing with a perfect tender texture inside.  The Sous Chef came out later to speak with us (a very nice touch) and talked about how he charred, and then baked it.  Chocolate Soufflé - 5.0 stars The texture of the Soufflé was very good and the molten chocolate oozed out of the middle across the plate just like you'd imagine.  But, while uber-chocolaty and decadent, it was a bit too sweet.    But, it was a GREAT experience & meal.  We would come back in a heartbeat.  Thanks Roy's!"}
{"text":"I won't go into all the details of Roy's. It's a chain and while the menu varies from place to place - it doesn't vary all that much. I personally love the chain It's got great hawaiin and asian-fusion food with \"americanized\" accents. They make great drinks...even the arnold palmer here tastes better than in other places.  But let me focus on this one in Summerlin for a minute. The two or three times I went, the service was pretty sharp. The location is great only if you happen to live or be staying in Summerlin. It's a bit of trek for tourists from the Strip. It stays fairly quiet inside which is nice and a bit of a change from most other members of the chain. No smoking except in the bar - which is a plus (this is Nevada after all)."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 6 stars!!! Our server Michele was the best we ever had. Prompt attentive courteous helpful knowledgeable. Our first time here and we were so amazed with everything. The Ahi and the Mahi were both phenomenal and the cheesecake was awesome. We will be back !!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! We've been to both the Chandler location and the Anaheim, CA location. Every single thing on the menu is incredible!! Can't wait to go again and try something new - you literally can't go wrong with any choice! Highly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't been here!"}
{"text":"Vast improvement over our visit 3 months ago, so it's worthy of an updated review.  We went to Roys for an early Valentines day dinner.  Service and food were spectacular.  Our waiter, Timothy, was hustling all evening. The girl bussing our table was exceptional... filling water and clearing plates quickly. She is ready for promotion....she was probably the most polite  employee there.  Even the manager refilled our drinks once.  Everything was served quickly and with a smile.  The food was excellent!  I highly recommend the short ribs. My husband marvels at the creamy texture of the mashed potatoes. The only issue was that we had to wait for our table 15 minutes after our reservation time. A couple arrived after us but were seated before us. Even if their reservation was the same time or before ours, it's my opinion that you should seat waiting/on time people first. We will be back."}
{"text":"Confused after going to Ray's Asian, we finally made it to Roy's fusion to meet up with friends on a Saturday evening to order off of their happy hour menu.   - Friendly staff. Open and closes door for us. Fancy fancy - Multiple waiters serving us - Tiny tables. We had a group of 5. Probably meant for 2. haha. Couldn't fit all the cups, small plates, and appetizers on the table.   - half off appetizers from 5-8pm. Ain't mad at that! - Sushi is pretty weak quite frankly. wimpy tempura shrimp. lots of rice. drenched with sauce pouring on the plate making it soft.  - Sliders were cute. Sweet potatoes fries are always good. - Idk why they think putting a pool of sauce makes the presentation nicer. lol. Order the gyoza to find out. haha - Overall, service exceeds food experience so that makes me come back for more."}
{"text":"The food was average - but service and dessert were great. Would go again but nothing to rave about!"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times. This last time I went, the service and food were bad. Maybe that's because they have a new manager. I will try it again with hopes that things have improved..."}
{"text":"One of the poorest food quality  I have had in a long time. The service was outstanding! The food was cooked well and to order, but the quality was way way below standards of even a causal. The worst  Mahi Mahi I have ever had. The Braised Ribs where very bland with no flavor. The Fillet was chewy. The  Peanut Butter Mousse was bit sour and not sweet.  The Calamari was really good. Ambiance is very classy."}
{"text":"Good food but not the best. Be prepared to hold on to your wallet.  Went in for some simple appetizers and no drinks.....walked out $131.00 later.  Service great just over priced in my opinion."}
{"text":"When you step into Roy's you are instantaneously transported to your Hawaiian getaway. It really feels like you are on vacation on the islands. Try Roy's signature Hawaiian martini and try to tell me different. It's perfect. We came here for valentines and had the four course prefix menu which ended with the most incredible chocolate souffle. It sent me over the edge. Roy's staff were all friendly and efficient. They all had the aloha spirit. The manager came to the table and gave us a $20 gift certificate after we paid the bill. How sweet is that? I love this place. It was a memorable dinning experience."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is the place to be. It starts at 4:30 and I want to say ends at 6:30. All drinks and selected appetizers are $5. The eats menu is limited, but has enough variety to give you a taste of Roy's.   I had been eating all days so these small bites were perfect. Enough to fill up and inexpensive. The offerings consist of lobster pot-stickers, lobster California roll, calamari, beef skewers, and wagyu beef sliders. All of the items come in tapas size portions. The calamari were tender and possessed the crunch that a superb karage should have. The sliders were the crowd pleaser. The beef was tender, juicy, and flavorful. Topped with caramelized onions, bib lettuce, and tomato made for a simple flavor that did not mask the immeasurable taste of the meat. It comes with sweet potato fries and these are pure crack; seasoned well then garnished with Parmesan shavings.  The drinks were a hit or miss. The Mai-Tai is a classic for anyone who wants a drink where the alcohol is not forthright. The same could not be said about my Pineapple Ginger Mojito. What is there not to like? It has all my favorite ingredients in it, but came on like rubbing alcohol. I really wanted to steal my friends Pink Grapefruit Paloma. Why didn't I find out about it during the summer? It is light, refreshing, bubbly and tastes like candy.   Getting there early is nice because only one or two other people were in the lounge area with us."}
{"text":"***Happy Hour Review Only*** The best thing about Roys Happy Hour is that it starts (4:30) about an hour before the actual restaurant opens, so we pretty much had the place to ourselves. The restaurant is elegant yet relaxed. Everything on their Happy Hour menu is $5.  Alot of us got their Original Hawaiian Martini, which was good. Apps we got were the Lobster California roll which was just average, not much going on there. The Lobster Potstickers were a bit better, had more taste, cooked nicely, loved the sauce, but it were really small, 3 little potstickers:( A friend got the Wagyu Beef Sliders, probably the best deal for the price (2 sliders and some sweet potato fries). The Szechuan Grilled Beef Tenderloin Skewers was a tiny portion also. The Salt & Pepper Crisped Calamari was a decent size dish. My companions seemed to like the food. We shared a Creme Brulee (not on happy hour menu), which was pretty tasty. Staff was great, very attentive, got our food and drinks quickly, being the only ones there helped I think. I'd go back to try the food in the restaurant, but I'd skip Happy Hour. It's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Really good happy hour drinks and some decent apps for $7. That's where the good stuff stops.  Sat down for a Travel Zoo Prix Fixe meal that was $59  Basically it felt like we were eating the dinner menu at a senior living facility. The fish came out on top of boiled Potatos. Weird. Flavorless.  The Mac and cheese had a gritty texture that was quite gross.  The fish itself was Amber Jack and quite overdone.  Would not go back anything other than the happy hour drinks. The food is utterly uninspired and bland. Which would possibly explain the lack of anyone under 60 in the restaurant at the time.  The bartender was excellent."}
{"text":"When Roy's came on the scene a while back i was a big fan.  Not so much anymore, and definitely not at this location.    My wife and I went for a late night bite recently and were very disappointed in the food and service.  We ordered the \"canoe\" appetizer, and it was horrible.  Bland, mushy, cold, industrial preparations.  Felt like the stuff came out of the freezer, popped in the microwave for a few minutes, and then left on the counter for an hour.  With two glasses of wine the bill came to $60.     We come to the JW every year for spring break, and had a similar experience last year.  Roy's must think they have a captive audience that is largely transient, because I can't see them getting much repeat business.   Save your money, grab an Uber and head off property to a restaurant that isn't just mailing it in."}
{"text":"Let me start by talking about our waiter, Ben!  He was awesome!  He was very professional and attentive without being a pain.  He even asked all the women at the table for their order first, then the men!  We went for Happy Hour.  The Mango Mojito was to die for...!  We all ordered a different appetizer (tempura-crusted ahi roll, wagyu beef sliders, lobster potstickers, ebi roll, Szechuan spiced pork ribs, to name a few) and there wasn't a single complaint.  Everything was fresh and made to perfection!  Too bad we don't live in the area, or they'd definitely see us again!"}
{"text":"First time here... We had an incredible experience... Great food!!! Service was good..."}
{"text":"THIS RESTAURANT IS NOT AT THE FLAMINGO HOTEL!!!  Do not go to the hotel looking for Roy's.  You will walk around for an hour with people pointing you in different directions, and then you will call the restaurant to find out exactly where in the hotel the restaurant is, and you will find out that you are still a 30 minutes walk from Roy's.  You will then go eat Mexican across the street since you will be starving.  Clearly this was myself and some colleagues a few weeks back.  Very disappointing since I know and love Roy's and we never made it there.  Do yourself a favor....plan better than I did.  Once you get there, you will love it.  Amazing seafood, sushi and the chocolate cake for dessert is amazing.   Best of luck."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner to go and when I was getting ready to pay I found out my account was hacked.  I was so upset not just because of what happened with my account but because I am in Vegas taking care of my father who is in the hospital and I had just found out my father-in-law passed away while I was here and not at home with my husband. I have to say that Simpson Leong, the manager and Stephanie, my waitress were so AMAZING.  They gave me my meal for free.  They were so very kind to me and I was so grateful for their kindness. Thank you for being so wonderful during such a difficult time!"}
{"text":"Otherwise known as \"my happy place\" I absolutely love this place BASED ON their happy hour alone and only when I'm sitting outside. Located in the beautiful JW Marriot Desert Ridge the drinks are always great and consistent each time I visit. For a happy hour menu there are quite a few appetizers to chose from. The service is always great! However I've never joined them for dinner and don't think I ever will. The dining room is always empty (granted they are located in a hotel)  but the outside is too beautiful to be stuck inside! Definitely recommend for their happy hour! I bring all of my out of towners for a drink!"}
{"text":"The aloha hour is gooood! The scallops w coconut black sticky rice was fabulous! I was alone (on business travel) and sat at the bar. The bartender was kind of rude. Even though I was alone my meal wasn't cheap. I did change my mind once right after I ordered and politely asked if it was too late to change. He said I could change it but then razzed me a little about it later but not in a friendly joking way. I changed to something more expensive...maybe he was having a bad day...which might explain why he stood and looked at his phone across the bar with my beer getting warm in his hand..."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to stay in Chandler for our anniversary.  We typically go to Scottsdale for our special occasions and we were reminded why after receiving poor service at Roys tonight.  Our bus boy gave superior service so we tipped him directly but our server did not provide half the service anyone should expect from this restaurant.  The food was pretty good but the lack of service tainted it."}
{"text":"Aloha hour...$5 lobster California roll and lobster potstickers are amazing!!! I first dined here a while back with my Mom. She absolutely loved it. We ordered the prixe fix menu and were dazzled by the display of each prepared item. This is definitely one of those rara-shishi type places where the portions are small, but the taste more than makes up for it. I returned here for happy hour with a coworker and we enjoyed some unusual (Strawberry Basil Martini) yet delicious cocktails and noshed on appetizers that were much easier on the pocket than the dinner menu. The only issue would be that the happy hour crowd here is more of an older bunch, but if you're just looking for some gourmet eats and delectable drinks this is your place."}
{"text":"Fine but not consistent with other locations. I've eaten at several Roy's, not probably in 5 years, but took my girls here for their first time for valentines and was definitely disappointed. The server was very nice and i don't fault him, but the kitchen definitely messed up this evening. Prix Fixe menu should make it easier to get people in/out with good food, but that was the opposite. The apps were good, but the next dish of soup and salad took forever. This is not the dish that should take a long time. Salad was the same temp as the soup, why wasn't the Caesar chilled and just waiting to add dressing? For the price I expect something other than bland non-seasoned white bread for croutons. Just seemed weird for a nice restaurant. The main dish was ok, wife's was amazing, mine which was the most expensive option was mediocre at best. The desert was ok, except the red velvet cake which taste worse than store bought. Cake was not soft and moist and very average frosting. Not what I expected when you say you have a master pastry chef. Small detail, but still frustrating, nice restaurants need to taste their water. When you serve water and don't ask if you'd like bottle or filtered than I expect the water to not have a bad after taste. This is an easy fix and overlooked. It took about 2 hours for dinner, about 15 min was our fault, but not worth the wait.  Last night I spent the same money for 3 people at another restaurant. We had more food, more drinks, and everyone loved their dining experience and couldn't stop talking about how good the food was. Had I known how far Roy's had fallen I would have taken my family to the place I went last night instead to ensure they had a special evening."}
{"text":"I'm so glad the manager got back with us or I would've given this place a lower rating... Food was delicious! We had the surf n turf, pork tenderloin and braised ribs - all wonderful! I wish I could say the same about the service... Caroline I believe her name was was terrible... She had a permanent RBF the whole time she served us... I wish her assistant was our server and I wish I could remember his name... If she does not like her job she should not be a server where your job is to be nice, I would know since I was once a server myself... I realize we have bad days but suck it up and put on a happy face ... Kudos to the manager for realizing how crappy she is and hopefully does something about her attitude..."}
{"text":"Food was a mix-bag while the service was great. I had scallops, my fiancee had ono.  Scallops were excellent the ono, however, was very dry.    I was a bit disappointed that this Roy's location has the 'standard' menu. I was expecting it to have the more frequently adjusted menu items since it's located in a fancy resort."}
{"text":"Robert and Matt are awesome! We came in for happy hour and were treated so well!   I stay at the hotel where this Roys's is located a fair amount and always find the service to be pretty good. This time was really noteworthy because of how warm and attentive everyone was.  Happy hour is a good deal with both bites and drinks on offer. So if you find yourself at this hotel and want to save a little money but not end up driving then this is a great spot. The food is always spot on and while it is a chain it is consistently good. I really liked the potstickers and ample pours of wine! ;)   My coworker was also really happy with the service. She was offered samples of any of the wines she took an interest in and was therefore really pleased with her selection.   Again it's a chain in a J Dub. Not the height of AZ culinary choices but happily a solid choice especially if your staying at the hotel. The staff have a great attitude that reminds me of a sweet vacation even if for only an hour... After that back to work."}
{"text":"The most flavorful food and friendly staff!  We have been to some of the finest restaurants in Las Vegas this week and many were good but this tops them all!"}
{"text":"We always like to go to Roy's happy hour from 4:00 to 6:00 pm and again from 9:00 pm to close.  We sit outside on comfy sofas.  The ribs are awesome and the Ebi roll is by far our favorite.  Service was good.  Never disappointed when we go to Roy's"}
{"text":"Good food, good service...However the dining room is in dire need of a refreshment in terms of updating, decor et...  My friend and I were there for happy hour and there was not a soul there. Upon seating, I first noticed a Nespresso commercial grade machine, which impressed me as it is a sign of quality.  The bartenders were very friendly and efficient but then again we were the only ones there. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and drinks as if we were famished and really thirsty or wanting to cause trouble and our bill came to $ 115...with my favorite being the samosas, a little fried dumpling made with red curry chicken. For drinks, I ordered the mango mojito and the red sangria which were both ok, just not enough booze in either drink considering the $ 7 price tag..  So the grade may seem a little harsh...however there was no atmosphere and again the dining room is in dire need of an update."}
{"text":"Roy's came highly recommended and I chose to go with the entire chef's recommendations for 4 courses.  I am short on time and will give the highlights and may fill in later. Entrance: inside of Marriott Resort approached from a gorgeous sitting area Reception: polite no issues, bland greeting Interior: somewhat cramped where we were sat.  The group behind me, hit my chair a couple of times. Table and seating were otherwise comfortable. Meal: for being the chef's specials and perhaps it is the local, I found every dish to be bland.  That is not to say bad, but simply lacking the punch I would expect for something hand picked by the chef.  Portion sizes were minimal for 1st two courses and adequate for 3rd.  4th was desert and it too was meh. Drinks: I had the recommended Mango Julep cocktail and again meh.  Tasted more like pineapple juice.  Seriously doubt there was alcohol in it. Waitstaff: top notch ... about the only thing that felt appropriate to price level.  Walter quickly refilled.  Frequent passes.  Bottom line: the meal was wanting for some pop.  The atmosphere was good but cramped where sat."}
{"text":"We love Roy's!  Reverse happy hour is great, their burger is the best.  Butterfish is amazing,  chocolate lava cake rocks.   And, they have booker ' s bourbon."}
{"text":"I went here for an unforgettable birthday with my boyfriend. The service was fantastic and the food was divine. Loved everything. Had the lamb, the chef's special appetizer roll and short ribs and lobster bisque. Since it was my birthday they gave us complementary dessert truffles (to die for).   Everything was amazing. The lamb, which we had med-rare, was juicy and tender. I've never had a better piece of meat. We got a bowl of lobster meat which had us confused.... until our service poured hot bisque in the bowl at our table. Such a delightful presentation! Each dish not only tasted terrific, but looked beautiful.   I want to try everything on this menu! Definitely our new go-to spot to bring our friends from out of town."}
{"text":"This Saturday night, we decided to have our belated Valentine's Day dinner at Roy's.  To say it was disappointing is an understatement.  The waiter was non-existent.  After stopping him as he passed by to order an appetizer, we pretty much never saw him again.  While the tables around us were served, we were sitting there for an hour and we were never asked to place an order.  In order to get a glass of wine, we had to flag down another waiter.  In order to get the check to leave, we had to flag down another waiter.   The plus side is the appetizer was good and the drink was good.  Too bad, actual dinner was a stop at Jack in the Box since it was now nearly 9:30pm."}
{"text":"To sum it up: great food, horrible waiter who spilled martini over everything and didn't try to make up for it---advised by friends to always go to the Chandler location instead.  So first, the food is delicious.  Went here for a birthday dinner with my mom and aunt. We ordered the Lobster Potstickers and Maui Wowie salad to start... I had the butterfish, my aunt had the red snapper special, and my mom had the Mahi Mahi. For dessert we ordered the pinnaple upside-down cake and the chocolate cake.  And two martinis.    That being said, the whole dinner cost more than $200, which is as expected.  But the service didn't compare to the food quality. Our waiter completely spilled one of the martinis all over my aunt, getting the drink all over her clothes, her handbag, and the table. The second martini got about ¼ of it spilled but the majority of it was saved.  So instead of help my aunt clean up, he grabbed the empty glass and ran off to the kitchen. He returned a 3-5 minutes later with 2 new napkins to wipe the mess up.  Meanwhile, my aunt is cleaning off her bag (thankfully it was patent leather instead of cloth, otherwise the restaurant would have been replacing a rather expensive bag).  When he came back, instead of offering to replace the table cloth, he just advised my aunt move over to the other seat... which was also drenched from the drink. It took another 15 minutes for him to replace the one martini, while my aunt sipped on her partial martini that he left for her (which we paid full price for even though a good chunk of it was missing). We had to tell him the table cloth needed to be replaced (since it was drenched) and he took all the silverware, plates, waters, napkins, etc. When someone else came and gave us a new cloth, it was another 5 minutes or so before we had to flag down another employee to give us new napkins so we could continue to eat.  Overall, the way the server handled the spill was embarrassing for him and the restaurant.  And for him not to replace the other martini that was partially spilled too was absolutely ridiculous.  I am not one to demand freebies, but when a waiter spills an alcoholic, sticky beverage all over a patron, the table, and her designer handbag, it wouldn't be a stretch for him to throw in a dessert on the house----or at least comp the beverage he spilled!   I hear that the Chandler location has MUCH better service because they aren't attached to a resort, so they actually have to work to keep their clientele. Next time I'll be going to that location. I advise you do the same."}
{"text":"Roy's is exceptional. This was the second time we dined here and whether business was slow or chaotic, the staff provided us with excellent service. This time, we came to celebrate my birthday and I must say it was a great choice. They really treated me like royalty from the time we checked in with the hostess to the time we walked out the door. Every employee that walked by our table wished me a happy birthday using my name. That wasn't the end of it. The menu as well as the dessert said 'Happy Birthday, Shue.' They sure do know how to make someone feel loved.    For a chain restaurant, I am quite impressed with how good the food and service is here.  My absolute favorite is the upside down pineapple cake.  I'm usually not the biggest fan of upside down pineapple cake, but Roy's recipe is definitely out of this world.  This is a great place to go for a date and/or happy hour..or your birthday.  The ambiance is romantic with an artistic modern twist.  Dress up business casual, wear your favorite shoes, and enjoy a nice glass of wine with your delicious meal."}
{"text":"Talk about the best steak ever. The cocktails are to die for and oh my goodness the desserts are orgasmic!"}
{"text":"Our second time to this Roy's in the JW Marriott Desert Ridge.  We receive excellent service from the Bartender and our waiter Gordon.  We asked a few questions about the wine and Gordon had no problem asking his co-worker, another waiter with more extensive wine knowledge to assist us.   He was passionate about wine and his knowledge was very good and we enjoyed hearing him tell us about wine from his point of view.    Of course the food was very good.  The butter fish was excellent as was my wife's Ribeye.    Pineapple upside down cake \"made to order\"...need I say more?"}
{"text":"We went to Roy's for a \"date night\" and most certainly did not choose wrong! We fell in love with Roy's when we were in Kauai and this location surpassed even that! From the edamame they serve instead of bread to the lobster potstickers to the Cesar salad, everything was melt in your mouth delicious! I had the Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi, and it was truly a dissolve in your mouth tender with a light crunch coating. We shared 2 martinis before dinner. The 1988 and a pineapple one. Both were fabulous. This has become our new favorite place to go for special dinners or anytime dinners for that matter. The service was excellent, though a tad slow coming from the kitchen, but since every thing is to order, that's understandable. The decor and ambiance was spectacular , lots of bamboo, flowers and tiki torches with a modern twist. Definite go to this place! You cannot go wrong!!"}
{"text":"So... I was rather unimpressed with this place.  Just pulling into the parking lot I had to go around 2 cabs that were parked out front of the restaurant, I would never advise anyone to leave the strip to take a cab here, it's really not worth it.  Then I almost hit 2 people who were coming on the wrong side of the parking lot on their scooters [ya I'm not kidding].  We were a little early for our reservation which was at 7:45, we got there at 7:00, the hostess informed us we were early and that we'd have a seat once it was time. There were like um I dunno 15-20 unoccupied tables-OK.  So we went to the bar that was indeed crowded and sure enough just missed happy hour by like 5 mins, that sucked [minus2].  Ordered a drink with one guy, who then left the bar and was taking orders at a table, 5 mins later girl brings our drinks over. Dirty martini wasn't very  'dirty  [minus 3]  After about 30 mins I went back to the hostess stand and asked if our table was ready yet.  It was, she walked 4 steps behind where we were sitting at the bar [now mind you this table was empty the whole freaking time] and sat us at a table by the bar. UMMMMM Ok how did that make sense?. [minus 4]  Bartender comes over and takes our order. I ordered a lobster dim sum appetizer that was really good.  Prices were reasonable, [plus 1], ordered a seafood combo and my friend ordered scallops.  Mine came out and was pretty good, the sauce on top of it  reminded me of a lobster bisque soup, the pea risotto was rather meh.  Friend's scallops were undercooked in my opinion, so much so, that he asked me if it was OK that he ate that them way. Waiter came over mentioned the scallops he said they always cook the scallops medium rare. hmmmm so I Googled it, it's there but I have never heard of medium rare scallops.  Anyhow, 3 out of the 4 scallops were cooked right, one scallop was definitely pink in the middle.  So the food was MEH for me, the service was MEH for me.. i have no intentions of returning!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the Roy's in vegas and decided to visit the one in chandler for happy hour last friday.  this is decorated just as lovely as the vegas one.  the cocktails were very tasty just like in vegas. I couldn't help myself, I ordered the same as i did in vegas- the original Hawaiian martini.  the bartenders were friendly enough.   overall the Roy's in vegas blew me away however this one in Chandler is very nice and I would return to try a different hh cocktail. great hh spot."}
{"text":"we celebrated our anniversary dinner at Roy's. we had a 615 pm reservation and we selected Roy's since it's a little off the strip and within our budget.   we were greeted pleasantly and they made us feel comfortable.  when the menu arrived, it had our names and happy anniversary inside the menu.     for my drink, i ordered the the original hawaiian martini and this is such a nice refreshing drink, the original hawaiian martini consist of fresh pineapples, SKYY vodka, stoli vanilla vodka and malibu coconut rum are shaken and served with fresh pineapple. made me feel like i was in Hawaii.  i will say that this is one of the best meals we had while in Vegas.  we decided to order the spring prix fixe menu for $35.95. which includes an app, entree, dessert. for my app i ordered the roasted beet salad, for my  entree i ordered the teppanyaki seared barramundi and for my dessert strawberry angel food cake.  the husband selected short rib bi bim bap for his app and his entree kalbi grilled hangar steak and his dessert he went with the roy's melting hot chocolate soufflé- i had a bite of it and it was so rich and yummy.  our server took a picture of us and dropped it off  at our table while we were enjoying our coffee and dessert. it's a nice gesture that they took a picture of us to mark our 14th anniversary.  everything was done very classy and i appreciated the nice touches. everyone was so sweet to us, especially our server. perfection."}
{"text":"I don't hate this place, but, it's hard to love a mediocre hundred dollar meal. Price doesn't always justify quality of food, and, Roy's is a perfect example of that. The food by itself is not bad, it's just not worth the price tag!   The appetizer sampler was good. Okay, some stuff was really good on that plate. The entree (fish trio) was disappointing to say the least, and, the chocolate souffle did little to make up for it. I wouldn't have disliked the dessert as much, if they didn't call it a souffle!  The great service jacked up my rating to a 3."}
{"text":"We went to Roys for the first time tonight. Everything was good. The service was on point. As far as the food, we had Lobster California roll and Ebi roll were great starters. My wife had lobster bisque which had a great curry type taste. For main courses we had the Braised short rib, yukon mashed and greens. We also had the lobster, shrimp, crab cake trio which was really delicious. It is definitely worth checking this restaurant out if you are visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents, which is always a hard sell since they have high standards and are on the cheap side.  Our waiter was attentive and patient with my parents' many menu questions. I asked for some more seasoning on my rice (I wanted the seaweed sprinkly stuff), and he misunderstood me and brought me some more of the amazing sauce that was on my fish, which we ended up gobbling up (and I got my seaweed sprinkles)  Highlights: Ahi Tuna Poke appetizer was awesome (as always) Our waiter poured free samples of Roy's brew (beer) for us Service was impeccable Parking was easy Fish was fresh  The place is not very crowded (economic downturn?) so we had reservations for 5, but they were perhaps not needed."}
{"text":"I had an issue with this place.  We came here for restaurant week and the menu didn't dazzle us.  It didn't showcase why Hawaiian is in the name of the restaurant.  The fish was average.  The flavors were not unique, just tasted like gingery soy sauce, and their beef is standard fare.  Also, the service was subpar.  The server did not even offer us the option of wine, jumped right into the main courses and our water glasses were often left empty.  Next."}
{"text":"I've been going to Roy's for at least 5 years and was never disappointed, until recently.  They have made a lot of changes and I'm not to thrilled. They used to have several options on a seasonal prefix menu. Now they just have one.  They also took the beef short ribs egg rolls off the menu. It was rich but so tasty. The portions have gotten smaller and seems to be more expensive. I noticed they are now offering sides? So it has a different feel for it. Then to top it off, a lot of new employees. the atmosphere just isn't the same either. It sounds like the bar has taken over the resturant because it was just so loud in the dining room area. Luckily thr chocolate soufflé was still incredible. But I'm afraid I'm not going to be running back. So sad."}
{"text":"The customer service here is excellent comparable to a 5 star restaurant.  Most of the food was very good.  I ordered the prix fixe menu and Mr. Bear ordered the Seafood Hot Pot.  The water glasses were always filled, dishes were cleared off.  They even folded the napkin when Mr. Bear left the table for a bit.    My only issue is that we made our reservation online and entered that it was our Anniversary, yet they did nothing special for us even though other reviews mention a photograph and menus with special surprises.  I am dissapointed that we were not given the same treatment.  The waiter never asked if it was a special occasion either.  Due to that we are dropping one star and not all the dishes were good.  The appetizer of the Beef Dim sum was barely edible.  The carrot cake was kinda dry.  As was the pineapple upside down cake."}
{"text":"The dining room has soft lighting and is cool and comfortable.  The restaurant staff made it a priority to make sure we were having a nice dining experience.  I ordered a fresh local greens salad with Carrots, Heirloom Tomatoes, Daikon in vinaigrette. Also, I ordered an Alaskan Black Cod with Baby Bok Choy and Furikake Rice. I had Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Soufflé. The meal was very tasty, satisfying and enjoyable. I had a nice time at Roy's. I wish the location was not so far out near the edge of town. It is not centrally located and inconvenient to get to."}
{"text":"Over priced with horrible service.   Steer clear of the red headed waitress. She is rude, condescending, and lucky to have gotten a tip. The drinks were very sweet, the meal was fine, prices did not justify the quality or service.  Note that this restaurant is independently operated and not at all linked to the hotel. Its unfortunate, as this place clearly doesn't reflect the impeccable service of the Marriott."}
{"text":"The food and service is always amazing here.  I had a business dinner there with six people and the wait staff knew exactly when to approach and when not to.  Super high quality seafood, vegetables, and dessert of course.  Will be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner, service, and experience.  We love going to Roy's all over.  It was our first time at this location and we were treated like we owned the place.  Outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Our stop in Vegas on our way to Hawaii had a preview of the Islands in the form of Roy's restaurant, famous for Chef Yamaguchi's fresh Hawaiian flavors.  We had been to Roy's in Waikiki a few years back and didn't even know he had a place in Vegas.  Making reservations was a snap and they had a $25 reward for a limited time.  Being off the strip, it's not as glitzy and a little more classy.  We sat near the open kitchen and had a great view of the well-oiled kitchen staff going through their paces (and nosily seeing what everybody else was having).  You are treated with a bowl of edamame with salt and sesame oil instead of a bread basket.  For appetizers, we started with Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs, Ahi Poké & Sunrise over Haleakala Roll, all very tasty and whetted our appetites.  My wife had the beautiful Spicy Seafood Hot Pot, brimming with shrimp, mussels & lobster tail and my son had the Alaea Salt-crusted Bone-in Ribeye.  The ribeye came with a side of truffle bacon mac & cheese, some of which I stole from his plate when he wasn't looking.  For myself, I had the Braised Beef Short Ribs, which was prepared differently from how I expected, being sliced and not on the bone.  It was still delicious though.  The Spicy Kimchi Fried Rice was a great side dish to accent the entrées.  For dessert, the signature molten chocolate soufflé lived up to it's reputation and oozed it's fresh-out-of-the-oven chocolatey gooey goodness all over the plate.  The pineapple upside-down cake, however, was overcooked (re:burnt) and a little lacking in the pineapple department.  It was also overly sweet, even for a dessert.  But that might just be me, the guy that likes a dash of coffee in his cup of sugar.  The accompanying house-made coconut ice cream, however, was smack-your-lips mmm-mm good."}
{"text":"Great Happy hour! I love their pineapple martini, it is nothing short of amazing. Food can be hit or miss sometimes for me but mostly bulls eyes."}
{"text":"A group of us went for a business dinner. We had a vegan in our group. Not one of us had a complaint with the good. Delicious, great portion size and the Hawaiian martini was yummy to!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars. This is the best dining experience I have ever had. I called to make reservations and was asked what was the occasion, I let them know it was an anniversary. When we arrived there, the workers all were wishing us a happy anniversary. They sat us by a very nice secluded table and dressed up our candlelight base with cute ribbons.  When we opened the menu book, we saw that they had printed out \"Happy Anniversary Evangelia and Andres\" menu sheet. We ordered the prix fixe menu at $35, the food as always was delicious and filling. They gave us a free desert and the plate had \"Happy Anniversary Evangelia and Andres\" and took our picture. This place is amazing and the workers are so pleasant and nice"}
{"text":"I've only been here for happy hour, but it was great.  We ordered the sliders on the recommendation of other yelpers and they were delectable.  The ahi roll (and some other roll) were just OK.  Next time I'm just ordering double sliders.  I clearly should have yelped this a while ago while my memory was clearer.  All drinks were half off which was really nice.  I had something with grapefruit and pomegranate (I think) then a glass of wine.  Very nice happy hour."}
{"text":"I chose this place because of the reviews.  I'm glad I did.  The food was incredible.  I had the mixed green salad and steelhead trout.  The salad had great bold flavors and the steelhead was cooked to perfection and very yummy.  The service was excellent.  With all the great places to eat in Las Vegas, it's hard to decide but you can't go wrong with Roy's."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere, and customer service was wonderful. I got the ribeye when I went (since I don't do seafood). I was told their mixed drinks are wonderful, but I couldn't tell you for sure. I stuck with coke."}
{"text":"Slow service. Staff was pretty stuck up and yet didn't know what German Reisling was when I tried to order it. Small, small and smaller portions. On top of it not being very impressive quality. Super expensive. And after 2 hours of being there I am broke and hungry again. No thank you. Will not be returning here."}
{"text":"We went for Aloha (happy hour) and the specialty cocktails for $5 were great as well as the calamari but the sliders were awful and the sushi rolls had no flavor. The place was pretty dead and they are obviously just hanging on... very sad to see when Flemings right next door is jam packed.  Better food and some personality behind the bar would work wonders. We would only return for the calamari and there is better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  The portions are tiny and the food is bland and overpriced."}
{"text":"I'm a slacker and didn't get any reservations in to the local restaurants I've been wanting to try for Arizona Restaurant Week. However, when I gathered some friends to decide on a night out, Roy's still had plenty of openings (not necessarily a good sign, but they have a large dining area). Now, I've been to Roy's a few times and they never disappoint, but I've been VERY spoiled with local, fresh, non-chain faire lately, so I wasn't expecting much.  The choices for restaurant week were quite good. I started with the scallops, which were a bit bland, but good quality scallops and veggies. I also had a Cucumber Basil Collins... the cucumber basil combination is my current favorite for cocktails and this held up quite well. My petite filet showed up and everyone commented \"oh, it's so cute!\" That's code for \"it's tiny!!\" However small the steak, the poblano mashed potatoes had a balanced kick, the red wine sauce brought the filet up a notch, and I was perfectly satisfied. What was supremely killer was the flourless chocolate souffle. I had remembered that Roy's does dessert like nobody's business, so I ordered a little glass of extraordinary port (Justin's Obtuse; I was excited to see it on-hand!) and went into fully food-induced orgasm mode. One touch from the fork and the souffle exploded with a flood of chocolate goodness, which went perfectly with the ice cream and drizzle of berry sauce... only to be elevated by the richness of the port.  Food aside, what impressed me most about Roy's was the service. Every member of the staff greeted us as we entered and departed. The host graciously offered to have the bar tab transferred to the table when our entire party arrived. Our waitress was full of personality and provided incredibly detailed descriptions of each dish. And when dinner wrapped up, they even offered to have our valet cards validated and our cars brought around front for us... nothing tops off a beautiful evening like having your car waiting out front when you finally decide to meander outside.  While I'm a confessed food snob, we'll certainly visit Roy's again... and it may become a special treat for happy hour now that the weather is nice; the cocktails are top-notch, their specials are a good deal, and the patio at Desert Ridge looks divine!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner for the first time last night at the Roy's here in Chandler, AZ.  I had the absolute worst experience in a very long time.  To be honest, the Butterfish was pretty good, but it should be at $38 dollars.  Here is where Roy's fell completely apart for us. The server was absolutely terrible, I told him that this was our first time at Roy's, but that didn't appear to matter. He never introduced himself, never told us about the specials and had a unpleasant attitude the entire time.  I overheard the server behind us introduce himself, being very professional, and explaining the menu in detail.  I can't remember the last time I didn't leave 20% gratuity, but quite frankly, the server \"Brandon\" deserved 0% and additional training. I'm not some kind of food snob, but Introducing yourself, and assisting the customer \"who is a first time guest\" isn't asking very much. We moved to Arizona 18 month ago, and Roy's left a terrible taste in my mouth. Awful Experience!  Gary L Traylor?"}
{"text":"I have now been to 3 different Roys across the country.  I did enjoy my meal at this Roys.  Probably one of the better places to get fresh Hawaiian based seafood in the middle of the desert.  I partook of the Swordfish off the main menu this time along with an appetizer and some dessert.  The lobster potstickers were excellent.  The lobster meat was tender and succulent with a crisp wrap.  Probably the best seafood potsticker I have had outside of a specialized dim sum restaurant.  The swordfish was dense and meaty.  While good the artichoke filling (different from the web based menu) was not to the quality I was expecting.  Although maybe this is just regression to the mean taking effect.  The pineapple upside down cake was excellent, but needs to be ordered during your meal so it is ready.  The cake was a nice tight crumb and dense enough to support the pineapple without being dry or gooey.  The pineapple was juicy and flavorful with a sweet sauce surrounding it that highlighted the flavor.  I did enjoy my dinner but have had better meals at another Roys, this maybe due to the swordfish comparing to the misoyaki butterfish.  The service was good with friendly and quick staff.  i would return to this particular Roys without hesitation and Roys in general."}
{"text":"Went here for their happy hour and loved it! Apps and drinks were $5 and they did not disappoint! Beef skewers, wagyu sliders with sweet potato fries, poke, and calamari. All of it phenomenal. I was worried knowing that outback had taken over the chain but was so happy with everything from service to food. A great place for a date or a quick bite before a show on the strip. We will definately return asap!"}
{"text":"ROY'S ROY'S ROY'S...!!! Both the butterfish and short ribs will blow your mind. Two totally different but equally excellent meals."}
{"text":"A regular 1000 pointer on Opentable we gave this a try thinking it was a chain so it wouldn't be that good.  We arrived and were greated with the nicest hostess ever.  WAfter being escorted to our table we were given a sampler of their appetizer specialty, lobster potstickers.  They also brought a special appetizer for our daughter including quesadilla, carrots, etc... she was in heaven.  First place I have been in in a long time that didn't make her feel like she was a third wheel or offer her only boring dishes.  The food was great, the service incredible and the desert fabulous.  Their fish is cooked to perfection and their choices are varied.  I wish the prices were a little cheaper but they do offer fixed price dinners for reasonable prices.  I would spread out the tables a bit more, we were close to our neighbors and overheard their whole conversation.    Still, a must go treasure in Summerlin."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and the staff is amazing! Very attentive and friendly, reminds of the one on Oahu. They brought us extra bites to nibble on and everything had the perfect flavors. I especially like their take on edamame with a little kick... YUMMY :)"}
{"text":"i come here every time in vegas and bring as many people along as possible.  probably the best all-around happy hour on earth - $5 cocktails and $5 appetizers.  to understand how great a deal this is you have to try both: the drinks are top shelf with fresh ingredients and the appetizers are a representative sampling from their very creative menu.  in short: get fat, drunk and happy for $30 and under a person."}
{"text":"Spent a weekend in Las Vegas and celebrated a momentous event here. Food was great and service was even better. Kevin our host was fantastic, with superb attention to detail. Our food was delicious and the location of Roy's was excellent. Off strip with ample parking."}
{"text":"It's one of those things... Roy and me had a wonderful relationship for a while and then Roy changed.  Yes, he still looks good, menu is looking sharp, but it's time to change the aquarium ph.  It's 2018 now and it looks like 2009."}
{"text":"I went with my brother and another couple. It was a Monday night at 6 and it was empty inside but we sat outside. We had wonderful service and the food was delicious. I had the ahi roll, shared the Maui Wowie salad, the butter fish as entree and the macadamia nut tart with expresso banana ice cream for dessert.  All of it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Terrible experience!!  Slow service and way over-priced!  We were a party of 9 and we  informed them it would be separate tickets. They lost my credit card. Insisted they didn't have it and after 20 minutes of looking for it , they finally found it shoved under some other stuff near their register. It would be customary for any restaurant to do a courtesy comp  on the meal but manager would not do it because I was not staying at the hotel. I am not a local, this was a huge inconvenience!  High end restaurant, low end service and very poorly managed!!  Will never darken the doors of a Roy's restaurant again.  Shame on you for a poor experience in every way!!"}
{"text":"A review for the \"Aloha Hour\" that could use a little island sunshine -  a smile and some attention from the bartender, a pineapple garnish, or...even a day-old orchid would have perked things up.   Here's how it looked from the bar, after receiving drinks: - Bartender doing prep work - stripping an herb - close enough for conversation with us but instead... - We hear a generously audible exchange with another worker who comes and goes from behind the bar - Two other servers hanging out at the end of the bar, we can hear rooting for some guests outside, \"it's cold out\" \"don't sit out there\"... - and meanwhile, I'm deciphering the Mai-Tai: a solid 2/3 of a lime sunk in the bottom (and a brown nub on it, I discover while I maneuver it through the ice-field to the surface)   An overlooked lime chunk doesn't the best garnish make - especially while watching the bartender do prep work. Aren't cocktails in general about the lovely mix of alcohols, the perfect pour and the garnish? Hawaiian cocktails are known for their style. Really \"needs improvement\" on presentation to make a guest feels like this place is on par with even a basic bar.   Let's go from low to high: when two of three food items finally arrive, (delivered by a kitchen runner from behind us) the food was plate-smashingly good! Both the \"Ahi Roll\" and \"Bacon mac and cheese\" - excellent textures and flavor combos.  The thing I remember about the third item: its absence. By the time we finished the whole roll and half the mac, we finally summoned the bartender, \"this is all very delicious\" and he looked over from his work. He didn't mention anything about the Wagyu sliders so I asked about them and he appeared annoyed, hastily went through a door behind the bar and several minutes later (seriously minutes, and we were ready to cancel it) but he appeared...put down a plate and merely stated, \"The kitchen burned the first batch.\" I've worked F&B and easy way out \"blame the kitchen.\" But blame and the kitchen and no apology? Maybe all these people were just having a bad day, but we weren't - and we didn't need to catch theirs.   The sliders were delicious too but insufficiently adequate to overcome the bad taste of a disjointed happy hour as un-aloha as that lime- definitely not on par with memories of Roy's Chicago and Waikiki."}
{"text":"Food and service were good.  Prices are reasonable.  The decor/ambience doesn't help them at all.  Felt like I was sitting in a hotel lobby from the 80's.  Recommend that you sit outside and benefit from the hotel grounds."}
{"text":"Wow the food is delicious. It's pricey for sure but worth the splurge! It's a unique flair and the chef clearly has put hard work into his plates. Make sure to get the potstickers and consider getting two orders. Trust me."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan of Roy's. You can never go wrong with Roy's Canoe Appetizer for Two - Grilled Szechuan Pork Ribs, Kalua Pork Dim Sum, Seared Tiger Shrimp Sticks, Lobster Potstickers & Crispy Spicy Tuna - all of which are simply fabulous. For my entree on this visit I had the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi - and the Spicy Soy Mustard Butter Sauce was absolutely amazing.  On top of the food, however, the service was amazing. There was a hockey fan at our table who was interested in the final Kings game (where, yes, they beat the Devils) and since there was zero cell reception where we were sitting a trip to the bar to see the TVs was the only fix available. Of course the game end was coming as the main course was being delivered and who I assume was the manager asked us almost immediately if we needed it placed under the heat lamps for a bit. To extend this good gesture it was brought back at the same moment the game was over and they were ready to enjoy the meal -- without even asking for it.  Then, if you have never been to a resort before in the Phoenix area get ready to leave the desert for a brief moment while you take in the surroundings of the Marriott location."}
{"text":"Very Average And Over Priced - Went to this restaurant while staying at the Desert Ridge Marriott. We were greeted by the hostess who obviously needs a lesson in phonetics, as she asked me 3 times how to spell my last name. And why do they need my last name you say? Because the waiter wanted to greet us.  Once seated, we were annoyed by 3 couples who were intoxicated and very loud. The waiter re-seated us thankfully.   We ordered the dinner salad that was very bland and small. The entrees were good (mahi mahi and shrimp) but not exceptional, but very pricey.   Although the experience was tainted by the loud blowhards, we still felt that the experience was much less than expected, and we regretted our choice."}
{"text":"Say Hello to Aloha Hour!  We had cocktails and ALL the apps on the Aloha Hour menu this week on the patio @ Roys.  The Musician was FANTASTIC and added to the ambience. We loved all the food selections, with the exception of the ribs, which were quite fatty.  The weather was a bit cool for AZ but the fireplace and heaters were a nice addition.  Service was attentive and nicely paced."}
{"text":"Lovely date spot with great food. Food took longer than expected...think the kitchen was backed up...but still had a great dinner."}
{"text":"I wish this could have been better, BUT...  The short rib mushie app (for 3 out of our 5) had a surfeit of sauce and pasta that was overcooked in the middle and mega-dente on the extremities.  All of the recipients (3 of 5) explained this to out patient wait person.  The mains were all aces!  Salmon was perfect as were the scallops (only 2 had the pork belly... this caused some interesting interplay) and the hangar steak was cooked per spec and well received.  For 3 of 5 of us, the dessert comprised too much cake, not enough flavor.  The crew thought the sour cream was lame.  Last, if you have an open kitchen, one would hope the staff played their part.  We are used to the Roy's in SF (2nd & Mission).  The chefs we could see looked like those booted from Hell's Kitchen... slow yet ineffective.  This might explain why there was no decent pacing to the meal.  Sadly, this has erased Roy's LV from our dining circuit, but Roy's SF remains a winner."}
{"text":"They have a lot of menu items I haven't seen anywhere else.  We had some sort of crusted fish/crab combo and the shorts ribs.  My wife and passed them back and forth.  All good. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our second time visiting this joint and loved it again. Last time we went for dinner. This time we did the $5 Happy Hour! AWESOME! We had an entire meal of the $5 appetizers. The beef skewers were the best! Sarah and Dave, the bartenders, were great and the food came out so fast! The $5 Happy Hour is every day except Saturday, but the word is that they may extend it into Saturdays eventually! The food, the service, the attention-it is all wonderful!!!!! We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Tried Roy's for the first time last night when we met some friends who rave about their Aloha Hour (Happy Hour).  Always avoided going because we tend to not like restaurant chains, but this place is a gem and exceeded our expectations.  The bar area is relatively small, but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.    For food, we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Crème Fraîche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.  Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle, which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering.    Definitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared.  Aloha Hour is a must.  Extra props to Matt, our waiter, and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service.  We had a great night."}
{"text":"I was initially skeptical about Roy's - after all, there was a Roy's in Philly a little while back, and for some reason, it didn't last. But...my husband convinced me otherwise, and I'm so glad that he did.  We made an online reservation.  We visited on a Thursday night - it was quiet and the atmosphere was very relaxing and nice. We ordered drinks (I got a martini, my husband got a Moscow mule) and they were brought to us quickly. They also gave us complimentary edamame for the table (it wasn't great, but it was free, so I didn't let it factor in to the overall impression of the restaurant). My drink was very strong, and it tasted good.  I ordered salmon, and my husband ordered a seafood meal (I think that it was lobster, shrimp, and something else that I can't remember.) It sounds crazy, but the rice that came with my meal was probably the best rice I've ever eaten. The salmon was unbelievable. I actually made \"all gone\" which rarely happens.  We finished our meal with the amazing molten chocolate cake - it was absolutely delicious. My husband isn't even a big chocolate guy, and he loved it.  This is not really within quick walking distance of any casinos, you will need to call for transportation (just my advice!)  I loved Roy's and hope that I'm back in Vegas soon to dine there again!"}
{"text":"I went here based on the yelp reviews.  Well....yelp you have let me down again.  This place is expensive and bland there are so many places that are cheaper and way better that are locally owned (St. Francis).  It was loud, the service was slow, hardly any beer selection and the fish was marginal and farm raised.  Go somewhere else......save your money."}
{"text":"The best part about this place is the service.  I was dining alone and traveling for business, but the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Leah was a fantastic server.  While she was taking care of a few families, she kept a watchful eye on me.  The other staff was also very friendly.  The happy hour is a fantastic deal for both food and drink.  The sushi rolls were great.  The one thing I was not a big fan of was the pot stickers that are recommended as a favorite by all the servers. They were okay, but I tasted more fried flavor than lobster.  I would have preferred them steamed. Other yelpers love them, so that could just be me.  All-in-all, you absolutely should visit this restaurant if you are staying at the resort or visiting the spa!"}
{"text":"I was never really all that interested in going to Roy's and only went because I had a gift card from a friend.   We were all set to order the summer prix fixe menu until our server recommended the Lobster Pot Stickers, Heirloom Tomato & Mozzarella Salad, Hibachi Salmon, Macadamia NutCrusted Mahi Mahi & Misoyaki Butterfish & the Hawaii Kai Style Beef Short Ribs.  SOLD.  It was all great and our server was great.   Nice atmosphere, & no wait. Really glad I had the gift card to make me go.  I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"visited Roy's for the 1st time in chicago and loved it, went to Maui but didn't get a chance to try it , until we found out there's one right here in AZ, we loved the cocktails, appetizers and food was great! Highly recommend for a special occasion, the service was excellent and we had a reservation that we had made only 15- 20 min prior to arriving,  but I do recommend making reservations if you have a large party.  GO visit this place if you want a nice seafood dinner and great drinks."}
{"text":"I agree with previous review. Butter fish was awful.  Onion rings tasted like cardboard.  Thank goodness it was happy hour prices otherwise we would have let the mgr know how awful the food was.  We will never return!"}
{"text":"The Misoyaki \"Butterfish\". The most delicious fish dish, everything on the plate is perfect. Lots of great items on the menu,  but WOW the Misoyaki \"Butterfish\"."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service....had a special birthday event held here, worked with the manager to make sure the night was special.  They created a customized, personalized menu, centered around our party.  4-course meal at it's best.  The menu consisted of a appetizer, salad, entree and deserts.  Food was very fulfilling, atmosphere and vibe was great.  Some people in our group had never experienced \"fine dining\" and they were blown away by the presentation and how prepared our hostess was....looking forward to visiting again....Nite was memorable"}
{"text":"I'm from Hawaii and have had my share of Hawaiian fusion, Asian fusion, Pan Pacific, Pacific Rim, whatchamacallit cuisine.  Roy's makes me happy... the food is excellent and service with warm aloha spirit brings me back to my hometown, Hawaii.  The fish there is so fresh (melt in your mouth fresh) and the food light and delicious.  A must try for sure!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here with 16 of my closest friends & family. Not only were we late for our reservations, but we were pressed for time because my aunts had a flight to catch right after. The staff was superb in meeting our needs, the food was delicious, the ambiance was beautiful (especially overlooking the pool area of the resort) and my young niece & nephews were well taken care of. The prix fixe menu is a good deal, the bowl of corn chowder easily serves 2-3, and the chocolate souffle was to-die for, like always! They were even so kind as to write \"Happy Birthday, Jennifer\" in chocolate on the rim of my (complimentary) bday cake plate."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and go someplace else!  My father and I have been to many locations of Roy's over the years, so when visiting Las Vegas he wanted to go.  That decision was a complete let down.  Atmosphere was completely bland and felt like you were eating in an office.  The waiter did not inform us about a non item special, Chilean Sea Bass, we had to ask.  When the food arrived my Mahi Mahi was over cooked and had no flavor, Dads fillet was under cooked, and the special Chilean Sea Bass was such a small piece of fish.  We ordered some lava cake and espresso for dessert. The lava cake had an extremely hard bottom that could not be cut with a steak knife, and the espresso never showed up.  Had to ask the waiter a second time for the espresso, and he was nice enough to not charge us for it.  For the prices this place charges, everything should be perfect and the food should make you scream with joy.  I will never suggest nor dine at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner for our Anniversary! Mahi Mahi was excellent, short ribs and lobster pot stickers. Rick gave great service and was so friendly made our Anniversary perfect. Also came by took our picture and a complimentary print out. Pineapple upside down cake was delicious!! Overall great experience, highly recommend and will definetely be back."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday and practically had the place to ourselves. We dined for lunch. The hostess did say that Sunday's typically are slower days. Our server was great, attentive and generally what I'd expect from an establishment like that. I've been to Roys in Hawaii but they are not opened for lunch so it was a pleasant surprise. I wish they offered a lunch menu but everything we had was delicious. We started with the sampler appetizer (I forgot the name) and it was amazing. My husband had the braised short ribs and I had the lobster bisque. Oh my word, it was all heavenly. My girls just had the keiki breakfast and it was breakfast. It's not always that we go all out for lunch but when we do, we'll make sure to go big with Roys. I'm already dreaming about the braised ribs (of course I took a bite)."}
{"text":"WOW is the only thing I can say when I left this place. The food was absolutely amazing. I had the pleasure of eating several courses and each bite was great. But the one thing that takes this place over the top is the service.  Our servers were very knowledgeable of the menu and options and made spot on recommendations. Everyone was extremely professional and welcoming. I do intend of on returning. Unfortunately it is a bit pricey but is worth it. While I wont be going every week but special occasions and anytime I am feeling like a treat I know where I am going."}
{"text":"Roys used to be one of our go to resturants. Used to be being the optimal phrase. Tonights experience was the last straw. After being told that the earlist we could be seated in the main, or outdoor, area, was 8:30, we were told we could sit at the  bar and still enjoy the full menu. It was 7:00. When we left at 8, there were still empty tables. We ordered drinks and looked over the menu. My wife has not been impressed with her choices the last few times and I have been so, so. After questioning our server about how serveral of the dishes were prepared, and getting very non-commital answers about how creamy they were, we settled on a shrimp risoto dish and herb scallops and halibut dish with polenta. My shrimp was over cooked and my wifes halibut was tasteless. Her scallops were good but the polenta was very creamy. Overall the meal was no where worth the almost $100 cost that Roys charged. The biggest complaint though was the service. Not only was.our server non-commital about how the food was prepared, I assume because he was a bartender and not a main room server, he never once asked how we enjoyed our meal. His tip was.indicative of our displeasure. As we left the resturant, we voiced our bad experience to the lady up front and again we were dismissed. The customer.service and the food is terrible and we will never return. What a shame!"}
{"text":"What an amazing blend of flavors! I love Roy's and will definitely make it a regular stop whenever I can find it. Definitely try the chocolate cake dessert, and the rockfish. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"My most recent visit to Roy's was 3/11/15. I have never been disappointed with the food or service, as I have dined there many times. However, I would like to mention a particular server in this review. We had the pleasure of having Ian B. serve us. He is superb and very pleasant, recommending items that we may not have tried if not for Ian. We usually have a seafood dish and as always, we were very satisfied. The fish is always fresh and cooked just so. I really do not think you can go wrong with any dish at Roy's.  I do have one small negative. We were seated by an area where the servers called out the orders to the kitchen and it was loud and annoying. Next time I will know better and not sit in that area.  All in all, a solid experience."}
{"text":"Oh ROY!  Ba-Boom!  I debated on a 2 star or 3 star review.    ....2 Star - - - Here's why:  I went here for a Birthday Dinner..The service was great once we got to the table...What I mean is we had late reservations.  The hostess acted like she was doing us a favor.  She made us wait 15 minutes for them to \"set up a table\". Our server was very good, and dinner was nice but the portions...wayyyyy too small.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a BIG eater by an case, but it seemed as they only served a \"taste\" of food. They did leave me wanting more with the salmon but for the most part it was disappointing.  I have to give them credit for having the Hawaiian brew which is very tasty if you give it a shot.  KONA BREWING CO."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! They have the best happy hour, $6 appetizers, wine, and martinis!! It's close to home and a great place to stop in after work. The service is impeccable, even in the bar area. Sushi rolls are yummy, along with lobster potstickers.  This is one of our favorites, we are here once or twice a month.."}
{"text":"This is one of my top fav restaurants. Their Prix Fixe menu is well worth the money. The food is exquisite and we always have 5 star service when we come here. Highly recommend for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. Wonderful birthday dinner for my mom. The food was gourmet but the atmosphere wasn't, thats a good thing. It was relaxing and nice and dark. Very casual but an up scale casual.  Our waiter was a wonderful guy. He was very cautious of my fish allergy. Much of the food there is made with fish since it is Hawaiian fusion. He was very careful to ask the chef if certain things had fish in them. I didn't even ask him to do this! That was the great part. He was just good at what he does.   We sat down and surprise! The menu had a special insert for my mom with her name and a birthday msg  Was going to try the calamari, but our dude informed us its fried with other fish. Nice for him to give me a heads up much appreciated. We got the garlic prawns to start. Very good, real nice sauce.  My boyfriend got Lobster Pot pie, very good portion. I never had a braised short rib in my life, and Im glad I had my first one here. It was so soft and had a great glaze.   Desert was a cute little layered crunchy thing that came with a pretty birthday greeting.  Very good place. loved the food!"}
{"text":"Mahalo to our server Clayton. He was very friendly and knowledgeable about Roy's menu items. The food delicious (I had misoyaki butter fish and my date had the shrimp and scallops with risotto), had the calimari appetizer and the wedge salad which Clayton had chopped and tossed for us. Service was great and the food delicious."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Been to this one, the one on Maui, and the one on Kauai. Nice selection of foods. They used to have the best Lobster Bisque but that disappeared from their menu several years ago which makes me unhappy since I can't find one even close."}
{"text":"Food is good, tried many dishes and they were good but the sushi is just ok. We have had better sushi so we know what good sushi like. Price is kinda too high compared to the quality of the food. Service is great."}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here for Restaurant Week and I was not disappointed!  The restaurant is beautiful and you are greeted by a huge fish tank with exotic fish near the hostess stand.  Feels like a little bit of Hawaii!  I did not know this place would be so \"intimate\" as in dimmed overhead lighting with candles on each table.  It would make a great place for a special date night.  As for the food, I tried the tempura ahi tuna roll appetizer, the short ribs entree, and the lemon blueberry cheesecake.  My favorite was definitely dessert!  The cheesecake was thick and creamy with a sweet graham cracker crust and topped with lots of whipped cream and TONS of blueberries.  The ahi roll was good, although I would have liked it even better if it had not been fried and had just been a regular roll.  The short ribs were also good and very tender, but sooo rich and fatty.  I know that's what you should expect with short ribs, but it was almost to the point of being TOO rich.  And the flavoring/marinade on it was a bit strong and salty.  I think it would be good with a lot of bland potatoes or something to balance it out.  It did come with a mashed potatoes side, but not enough to counter all the strong flavor and fats from the short ribs.  I also like that they offer online reservations, makes it so simple and easy to plan your night out."}
{"text":"I have always liked Roy's and make it a habit to get to a Roy's a least a couple of times every year. Very good fusion cooking.  This location on the JW Marriott property was very good. Nice patio seating area, good service and of course great food. Their appetizer sampler plate is a good way to start.   Good wine list and all of the entrees our group had were well liked.  Vital Statistics: $5 appetizer happy hour menu is a really good deal. They also have some good wine options at very reasonable prices. Overall you will spend about $60 - $70 per person if you splurge a little."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE! My husband and I went here for New Year's Eve and had one of the best experiences we've had in all of Vegas. The staff greet you every time with Mr. & Mrs \"last name\" which I find to be a classy touch. My husband and I have a very alternative look about us and therefore we tend to not always be treated like we should service wise, but at Roy's that was not the case at all. Our waiter was very attentive, but didn't over do it. Now for the food... there was a set menu for NYE. It didn't disappoint. We both had steaks. My husband the filet and I of course had the ribeye. Both were very different in the style which was great. His was more classic steakhouse, and mine had a more rustic vibe. I will definitely be going back here again."}
{"text":"Have the lobster pot stickers have been there a few times has good service and good food"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at celebrity Roy Yamaguchi's chain-restaurant:  Roy's!  I had enjoyed a Roy's Classic Four: Hibachi Grilled Atlantic Salmon, Misoyaki \"Butterfish,\" Blackened Island Ahi, and Roasted Macadamia Nut Mahi Mahi ($53) with a Flirtini on the side.    The Hibachi Salmon was cooked to perfection which Arizonians seem to love to over-cook.  The Blackened Ahi was moist.  As for the Misoyaki Butterfish, OH. MAH. GAWD!!!  The butterfish supplied an explosion of flavor where I literally closed my eyes during that first bite.  Phew, is it me or is it getting hot in here?  The staff is super friendly and the ambiance is perfect for a date with your significant other!"}
{"text":"Roy's is a branch of the Hawaiian chain. The chain is known for friendly service, and this branch was no exception, from the valet to the bartender to the waiter. It was very easy to relax here. My meal: *  A complimentary appetizer of a grilled shrimp (good), barbecued spare rib (very good), pot sticker (good to very good), and crab cake (fair to good). *  Asia Pear Salad. Recommended by my server, it had a few (but not too few) thin slices of Asian pear, with a large amount of good mixed greens. The passion fruit dressing was far too sour. Rating: fair to good. *  Japanese Misoyaki Butterfish. Grilled butterfish, nearly black on one side, using a sweet miso grilling sauce. Served with baby bok choi, rice, and a little bit of a couple of sauces. The fish was delicious - soft, buttery, tasty. The nearly black grilling gave it very good flavor. The only criticism is that the fish was of uneven thickness, and as a result part was nicely cooked while part was slightly undercooked. Very good. *  \"Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffl - Flourless Chocolate Cake with a Molten Hot Center, with Vanilla Ice Cream.\" This was a dark chocolate souffl. The very hot molten center has an intense chocolate flavor. The vanilla ice cream was ordinary. Rating: very good to excellent.  After eating at Roy's, I felt it was good. However, I've since seen how many fine restaurants Las Vegas has to offer. I still think Roy's is a reasonable value, but there are better places out there."}
{"text":"Amazing service and decor. Try the ribs, they melt in your mouth"}
{"text":"Why did they close the Charleston location?? The butterfish is the most delicious thing on the menu, but everything is great right down to the cocktails."}
{"text":"I cannot imagine how many times I would dine at this place if I lived locally. Within the last seven years, I've probably dined here over 20 times.  The food is consistent and delicious. You can never go wrong with the lobster dumplings, butter fish, and the molten chocolate cake.   The service is pretty decent, and the presentation is impeccable.   If it turns out you have food allergies, call ahead, they will work with you. A good friend of mine is a diabetic and we call a day ahead and let them know and they always have something ready for him. What a nice bonus!"}
{"text":"Met friends at Roy's on Saturday for Happy Hour and although the food was okay the service was below par. Our first complaint was the overly loud music which the waitress commented that he is known to be loud and plays there only on Saturday's, we then asked if we could eat outside and were told no because it there had been a little rain on Friday and the marble could be wet, hello this is Phoenix! It was 92 degrees on Saturday! The busboy must not have been properly trained because he almost spilled soy sauce on my husband's white shirt and then poured reg water into his sparkling water which we had paid for and then when we told him he didn't make any adjustments, no offering to replace his sparking water or even apologize. I complained to the waitress about our busboy and she went directly to the manager and no response from him either! I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"An equally impressive version of the Hawaiian classic.  Great sushi, entrees, and drinks."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that if there was a Yelp site where businesses got to rate and review their customers, I would receive less than 1 star from Roys after my visit a few nights ago. Me, and my girlfriends, may have been the worst table to ever step foot in their restaurant. They were thrilled to see us go.  We were staying at the property across the street from the Marriott, where Roys is located. It was a trip with several of my college girlfriends and we see each other only a few times a year. We looked over our restaurant choices and decided to go with Roys. We made reservations for 7:30 pm, got dressed up for our big night out, and headed across the street. We were 30 minutes early and this is where the problems began. Several of us, feeling in a celebratory mood, had consumed cocktails during the day and were feeling good when we arrived. Having 30 minutes to kill, we decided to enjoy a drink by the firepit. Vodka martinis with blue cheese olives (yum). Our cocktail waitress there must have been new because she struggled a bit, but whatever, we were having  fun. Unfortunately, vodka martinis on empty stomachs were NOT a good idea and by the time we were seated in Roys, a few of us were, well, blottoed. After one of my girlfriends announced \"I don't want to spend $40 on a meal right now because I want to drink my dinner,\" I realized that the night might not go quite as I had thought. So, we had a dilemma... do we get up and leave or do we stick it out? Right as we were debating that issue, our lovely waitress Laurie (from Illinois) came around the corner with our drinks. Our decision was made... we would stay.   After the first round, we had to secretly--- via a finger across the throat--- indicate to Laurie that serving another drink to one member of our party would not be a good idea. She seemed in complete agreement and played along with us as we diverted attention away from an empty coaster. I then told her one of us was a vegan, which must be a nightmare for pretty much any restaurant. Not nearly as big of a nightmare, however, as food allergies which I also have. I informed her of that --- I'm allergic to shellfish. She gladly brought the vegan menu and I ordered something that sounded delightful. By the time, two of the party left in pursuit of cocktails rather than food.   Long story short, my vegan meal showed up COVERED in green and red peppers which I am ALSO allergic to. I swear on the menu it said nothing about bell peppers and Laurie immediately offered to get me something else. While waiting, my girlfriend begged me to take my vegan hat off for a moment and try her delicious fish, which I did. When our waitress returned, my girlfriend asked what kind of fish it was. Laurie told her and all I heard was \"blah blah blah fish covered in a lobster sauce.\" OMG. I just ate lobster!!!!!! I exclaimed as Laurie looked on in horror. She swiftly left the table and I tried to figure out what to do.  She then came back with the head waitress to discuss the situation, then with the manager who looked particularly unhappy but offered me an EpiPen. I had them box up my second vegan entree (which I ate the next day and it was great) and left without the EpiPen, but in search of Benadryl.   Needless to say, Roys was thrilled to see us go. I think I saw a few rose petals floating behind me as we talked out. But they handled us so beautifully, especially our waitress, that I had to give them a 5 start review. Other than the bristle of the manager (which really, can you blame her?) they were fantastic to probably the worst table that has ever dined at Roys."}
{"text":"Conveniently tucked inside the Marriott Desert Resort.  So those staying at the resort can get some fresh seafood and their asian cuisine craving satisfied.   Food: I feel many of their dishes take on a modernized/fusion Japanese style.  Sushi, lots of teriyaki, and sweet pickling.  They also offer a vegetarian and gluten free menu.  Not a whole ton of items on these menus, but def have some options.  We started with the caterpillar vegetable roll and futomaki.  Both were refreshing and delicious.  If you want to start with a vegetarian roll, go with the futomaki.  Don't know what was in it, but something gave it this wonderful smoky flavor.  Highly recommend.  I had the salmon.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, medium rare.  The sauce was a little on the sweet side, as well as the pickled cucumbers that came alongside.  Dabbed on some sriracha, and I was good to go.  My friend got the tofu dish.  Nothing special there.  Two large pieces of tofu grilled with what appeared to be teriyaki sauce drizzled on top.  Once again, sriracha to the rescue.  We ended with the lime tart.  Refreshingly tart and sweet... no sriracha needed here.  LOL.  Good meal, with fresh ingredients, presented and prepared well.    Service:  Definitely no complaints here.  We were greeted at the front by a pleasant hostess.  No need to wait, because we went a bit early, around 530pm.  Now while we were eating dinner, it got really packed.  So if you don't want to wait, I would avoid normal dinner traffic hours.  Our waiter super friendly and patient.  Helped explain the menu.  Drinks were always full, never had an empty plate sit too long, and not once did I need to do the side-to-side head turn to find our waiter.  Service with a smile, check.   Ambiance: nice and romantic, candles everywhere, mood lights on strong.  Dressing up a bit may help to enhance the experience of the dinner.  Cute top and jeans, or maybe even a cute sundress or maxi dress.    Dranks: Oh boy.  They had a great wine list.  Even the per glass option was not too shabby.  Long list of various types of sake.  Some good beers available.  Now the cocktails.... would not recommend.  Not sure why these cocktails were on the too-sweet side.  I mean, even the jalapeno margarita was way too sweet.  They do have a full bar, so you may want to stick to what you know you like.  Overall: Was a good experience.  Not really sure if I would give it another go, but it also may just have been my order that night.  They do offer fresh ingredients, great service, and booze... so I would recommend everyone trying it at least once.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"It's great to be back in Vegas and again enjoy Restaurant Week offerings.  Wasting no time, Diane and I went to Roy's to sample its cuisine for the first time, and except for an order of sushi, stuck to Restaurant Week menu items.  After a short wait, we were ushered to a booth.  Ambiance was rather elegant, with much polished wood and a show kitchen.  Only a small blotch on our tablecloth detracted from the romantic mood of the setting.  After scarfing down all salt-boiled beans inside pods of complimentary and addictive Edamame, which was well seasoned, I opened with Sunrise at Haleakala sushi, a warm, interesting, and crispy roll of tuna, yellowtail, salmon, avocado, and asparagus served with Spicy Butter Sauce on a decorated platter.  This unusual, tasty dish was given tempura treatment on the outside but spicy tuna and other centered, edible focal points were left raw on the inside.    Continuing on with multiple appetizers, Crunchy Golden Lobster Potstickers were served in a mild Spicy Togarashi Miso Butter Sauce.  The potstickers were very good but not that crunchy.  Panko Crisped Calamari with Macadamia Nuts, Orange Chili Glaze, and Yuzu Aioli looked angry, probably because of the highly spicy Higurashi hairs that liberally adorned it, and black spots that looked like crayfish eyes but weren't.  My wife could not handle the high spiciness of the dish, which was noticed by our server, so he brought a whole new batch sans Higurashi hairs.  But, it was still too hot for her to consume.  Diane has a very low tolerance to spicy food.  But, even for me the first batch of calamari was very spicy hot, although the second not so much.  The calamari came with few nuts, but the strips of squid were cooked perfectly, and the very creamy and soothing Yuzu Aioli, with its slightly citrus flavor, ameliorated much of the spiciness of the dish.  The Shellfish Sampler, which included a Butter Poached Half Lobster Tail, a moist Seared Crab Cake, a large U10 Sea Scallop, and two medium-sized shrimps with Bok Choy, Mashed Potatoes, and Beurre Blanc, nevertheless seemed to be a small dinner portion.  But, all of the crustaceans were tasty morsels.  A large hunk of Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi was cooked just to correct doneness.  It was well seasoned but perhaps a bit too heavily salted.  The fish melded well with the soft Red Potatoes that supported it and the Maine Lobster Essence that was smeared on the fish platter.  Accompanying asparagus was of the small variety and undistinguished.  Roy's Melting Hot Chocolate Souffle was decadent and delicious, especially spooned with the smooth Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and specially requested Lemon Creme Anglaise that accompanied it.  The chocolate inside the souffle was hot and upon being opened did quickly melt as billed.         Another great dessert was the muffin-shaped Mascarpone Cheesecake with Coconut Crust, Lemon Creme Anglaise, and Blueberry Syrup.  The cheesecake was moist and creamy, and blueberries in the Blueberry Syrup added a welcome fruity flavor to this second delicious dessert.  One of the delights of Restaurant Week is that, besides the incentive to try out new places, the three- or four-course meals offered at a reasonable price supply enough different food for a party of two to sample multiple appetizers, entrees, and desserts.   Service was friendly, very efficient, and extremely accommodating, and all food was well prepared.  I only wish Diane liked spicy food, so I could make several return trips to Roy's.  I still may sneak back someday on my own!  This was a solid 4-1/2-star experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service! One of the best places for happy hour in the Chandler/Ahwatukee area!!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend Roy's to anyone. I first dined at the resturant in 2006 for my husband and I's 1st anniversary. The service was great, the food was delicious, and the mini-french rolls with butter were delectable.  In 2009, the experience was completely different. Edamame replaced their bread/butter. I am a Texan gal and love bread and butter with my filet mignon.  The service clearly went downhill; the waiter never refilled my champagne nor my husband's soft drink. There was no anniversary dessert offered like during our first visit. Overall the service no longer catered to the customers.  I did speak with management a week after our visit and he offered a free dinner. We never took him up on the offer because we frankly will never visit this restaurant again.  Save your money and go to Mastro's or Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"I've been to several Roy's locations and have enjoyed every meal I've had here. I love the Las Vegas location; I think they have some of the best seafood in Vegas. The ahi is an absolute must-try. And the edamame that they give you to start off the meal has the most amazing seasoning on it. The service is very professional and fast. I definitely recommend reservations here on the weekends."}
{"text":"I was the entertainment for a wedding reception recently and I was amazed at how fantastic this restaurant is! The staff was very attentive and so nice. The food was absolutely awesome! My pianist and I enjoyed a small bite after we were done and it was delicious.  I enjoyed the Lobster California Roll and a glass of Wente Morning Fog Chardonnay and it could not have been more perfect!  Next time you are in Vegas, make sure you stop by this off-strip gem.  I may have to go again for my birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, and relaxed and stylish atmosphere. Great service. Ever since I first ate food by Roy Yamaguchi I've been a fan. Excellent cocktails too. This is a great place for a special occasion.  They have a dedicated gluten-free menu too, which even includes a flourless chocolate desert, which I've heard is amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing fish!  Got the Butter Fish and Salmon and they were both some of the finest fish I've ever had.  Wish they would've had some yummy bread, that's what keeps this from being a 5.  Chocolate Lava cake was amazing as well."}
{"text":"If you're looking to get away from the craziness of The Strip and want a great meal, this should be on your list. Service is very friendly and professional and food was wonderful.  We shared a starter of tempura sushi roll with ahi, swordfish, and salmon that was very fresh tasting and delicious. I ordered the shellfish sampler with stuffed shrimp, lobster and scallops over macadamia nut pesto risotto. Fish and risotto were perfectly cooked and a home run. My boyfriend ordered the macadamia encrusted mahi mahi. Cooked to perfection, moist and full of flavor.  To round out the we had their pineapple upside down cake with coconut ice cream. AWESOME.  Even though this is a chain, they are following a formula for success. We have been to other Roy's and they are a consistent winner for great food and service."}
{"text":"If you love Japanese Hawaiian fusion then Roy's is your place!! Delicious seafood options and top-notch bartenders make this place a must. Overly friendly staff that is there to accommodate your every need. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great spot... They treat us like kings. Everything was great. The waiters and bar staff were great."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite restaurant in Vegas, and I HIGHLY recommend joining their email list because they give amazing perks!  We've been several times and always come away full and happy.  We left not too long ago from a good-bye dinner with our friends to enjoy a final night out before my husband is deployed.  We were over half an hour late (we did call to let them know!) and they were still as friendly as could be and we were immediately seated.  The menus had special inserts that said \"Happy Birthday and Be Safe!\" (it was a birthday dinner, too!), ribbons were on the table, everyone who came by wished him happy birthday, and his celebration dessert was delicious and impeccably decorated.  Our waitress then took our picture and had it printed and brought it out for us.  I could not ask for anything more. I have tried many things on the menu and always been impressed.  This time I asked for a dish normally included as part of another appetizer to be served on its own, and they did it without even blinking, and it was of course delicious.  I would recommend the appetizer boat for two, the mahi-mahi, and any surf-and-turf combo available because they've all been stellar.  Our friend enjoyed the butterfish, he said he cannot wait to return to eat it again. Desserts are my favourite part, everything was soooo yummy!  The dessert portions are kind of small but I like that, as I'm usually too stuffed by the end of a meal to enjoy a large dessert, and their taste perfection makes up for anything they lack in size.  (And to be honest, they aren't even that small.  It's just moreso places like the Cheesecake Factory serve such large dessert portions that when I see a normal one I'm like, \"Hey, what's this white space on my plate??\") We always leave wondering when we can come back, and now with this lovely send-off Roy's is held in even higher regards with me.  My only complaint?  That the Summerlin location is no more - now that is a true tragedy."}
{"text":"LOVE! Their happy hour is amazing! The kobe silders with truffle oil sweet potatoes fries was YUM! & It was only $5! Also, their shellfish seafood medley was to die for! Ah..I was in heaven...  ^_^"}
{"text":"Amazing food and knowledgeable, attentive service!!  A little pricey, but definitely worth the money is you are looking for quality, style, and service!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Ordered the sushi which was expensive, but since this was happy hour it was $5 cheaper.  They bring only 6 tiny pieces out.  Are you kidding?  I wonder who many you get if you pay full price?  Then I order the sliders at $7 instead of the $11, and they only bring out two.  Tasted good, but two?  If you pay the full price do I get four?  I would have asked the bartender but he was too busy watching the game.  A foo foo place--prices too high, quality too small. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great for special events, I mentioned in the reservation we were there for a 30th birthday and we were given menus with a personalized insert in the first page.  Additionally they gave us a small dessert with happy birthday written in chocolate on the plate and took a photo they print out and place in a Roys paper frame for you.  We ordered the Hawaiian martinis which are delicious and dangerous as the fruit masks the alcohol content very well, and the miso-yaki butterfish which I think is the best thing on the menu, it is so flavorful, and whenever we come here (about twice a year) I just have to get it.  We also ordered the boat for two appetizer, the rib, shrimp, and chicken pieces were especially tasty and I would consider those again as individual apps but pass on the lobster potstickers and spicy tuna roll as they didn't stand out."}
{"text":"We had our Wedding Reception on 031415 at Roy's and they were absolutely fantastic. Everything was planned by a friend and was spot on. All guests were catered to impeccably and even my vegan demands were met. This is the second time we've been to this Roy's and they are always friendly, professional, accommodating and  the food is perfect. Thanks Roy's!"}
{"text":"We have been several times and always had excellent food and service!  We have ordered almost everything on the menu at one time or another and never disappointed!   It is a little pricey but I know I will get my $$ worth"}
{"text":"We came here almost 7 years ago and decided to come back to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The decor and ambiance inside is nice, the hostess greeted us quickly and showed us to our table and handed us our cloth napkins. For starters we ordered the calamari and the calamari itself was lacking seasoning on the batter, but the firecracker sauce definitely made up for it. It had an Asian flare and nice spicy kick. I ordered the filet mignon and what I got did not look nor taste like the filet mignons I've ever had before. It was a flat piece of meat that was overly charred and burned on the outside and covered up with some kind of weird sauce that didn't taste very good. My husband got the Roy's trio that came with ahi tuna, butterfish, and salmon with a side of rice. He didn't like the ahi and said it tasted funny and the other two fishes were just ok. Our server took forever to come back after we got out food to ask how things were and we wanted to ask for hot sauce and a redo if the steak but the time we waited for him to come back just wasn't worth it. The fries we ordered were nothing great. We saw on yelp pictures that other guests got really nice anniversary desserts and what we got was definitely not the same but I understand times change and it was better than nothing. Overall, nothing great and we probably won't come back."}
{"text":"xoxo the \"1998\" cocktail, just a bit too sweet for this ol' sour lady.  The yellow tail was SO GOOD. I loved the coconut milk broth."}
{"text":"I saw an ad for Roy's $39 prix fixe dinner and thought we would give it a try. I have to been to Roy's before in Orlando and Hawaii and it was very good. We arrived at 5:00 with no reservations but that was not a problem since the restaurant was empty. This Roy's seems really outdated compared to the other locations I have visited. We were quickly greeted and seated. Our waited was over to the table quickly to take our drink orders. I went with the recommended signature maitai. We were ready to order when he returned with the drinks.   The prix fixe menu allows you to choose 1 of 2 appetizers, 1 of 2 entrees and 1 of 2 desserts. I went with the shrimp shumai, Kona coffee crusted pork & Kauai prawns, and the chocolate souffle. We also started with an Ebi roll which is shrimp tempura, cream cheese, avocado, coconut and habanero sauce. Unfortunately the theme of the night was very nicely presented good looking food that just had very little flavor. The descriptions all sounded wonderful but failed to live up to expectations.   The Ebi roll arrived after a few mintutes. It was quite small being only 6 pieces as most sushi rolls are 8. It was ok but quite bland. We could not taste the coconut or habanero. Next was the shumai. Served on a long white plate it was probably the least appealing looking and tasting. They tasted just heated up, not freshly made.   Next up was the main course. Again, I was really missing the flavors promised in the description. The pork loin had no kona coffee flavor at all. It was well cooked though. The prawns didn't have too much flavor and just a little too fishy which fresh prawns are not. Lastly was the chocolate souffle. The souffle was cooked to perfection! It was served with vanilla ice cream and a raspberry sauce which was not mentioned on the menu. The raspberry sauce totally over powered the chocolate. Every time I took a bite of that rich chewy chocolate all I could taste was tart raspberry. What a shame because it would have been a 10 without that sauce.   The service was absolutely fantastic, 5 stars for sure. Our waters were never less than 3/4 full and empty dishes were cleared quickly. If our waiter was not around one of the assistants always was. The courses were also timed very well. Compared to my two other Roy's experiences this was disappointing."}
{"text":"Not bad, but considering the price, it's not good.  I shouldn't have a high expectation for seafood in AZ, but still, it's pricey and the taste was mediocre. I liked the atmosphere though. It's a good place to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times. Tonight though, the food we ordered wasn't quite as good as the other times. Shrimp was tough, mashed potatoes had an after taste, rice was very sticky and lumpy. Although the lobster potstickers and braised short ribs did not disappoint."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience here.  We started out with the Aloha Happy Hour outside, enjoying the tunes and the service.  Dixie was our server, and she was outstanding.  The drinks were great (I love the skinny margarita), and the apps were OK.  My only complaint on the apps were that they were not on the healthy side.  Fried/tempura sushi rolls, and we had the beef tacos and they were very greasy.  They need to add an appetizer that is a version of the butterfish for Happy Hour.  We moved inside for dinner, and of course, we ordered the Roy's Classic Trio, and the Seafood Trio.  You cannot go wrong with either one of these options.  Dixie was also our server here, and her service continued to be rock star.  We were consistently greeted by management staff, and the rest of the wait staff was truly wonderful."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Roy's in Hawaii about 10 years ago, where I fell in love. Now that I live in Vegas (coincidentally only about 1.5 miles from the Roy's in Summerlin) I am still a frequent diner to Roy's- no matter what they always deliver a delectable meal!   Best Appetizer- Ahi Poke, a traditional Hawaiian starter, it has onions and avocado mixed in, which all together it just melts in your mouth. Their edamame has chunks of sea salt on it that are like the size of a large grain of sand- I love salt, so it's one of my favorites!  The butter fish is always prepared and cooked flawlessly. The macadamia nut crusted opakapaka with lobster sauce (It was a special when I was there last) was outstanding.   For dessert, the chocolate soufflé- be sure to order this before you start your entree, it takes a little while to make.  Don't feel like going for dinner, they do have a great Happy Hour too!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food, and interior. Upscale hawaiian-fusion."}
{"text":"If a place has a bunch of good reviews, most people, myself included, would probably ignore the one star review.  But I'm going to post anyways.  I had been wanting to try Roy's since going to Hawaii a few months ago and never had the chance to go.  So when we drove into Vegas and picked up my parents at the airport we checked into our hotel, took showers and started walking to Roys.  The walk took a bit longer than anticipated - little over 30 minutes.  I called the restaurant and told them I was running late for my reservation.  The hostess told me they stopped serving food at 9:30 and closed at 10.  I ended up pretty much jogging the last 5 minutes to the restaurant to make sure we got there on time and left my husband and parents walking behind.  I got there at exactly 9:33. Basically, if we would have gotten there at 9:29 we would have been seated.  They refused to serve us anything but dessert.  When I explained I had been wanting to eat at Roy's for months, and my parents had been traveling for 8 hours, and we had been driving for about as many, and had just walked 30 minutes to get there - me jogging at the end - and just really wanted some hot food, the manager said - 'well, some of our desserts are hot'.  What?! Can't believe he said that. Apparently, the food is good from other reviews I've read, but due to their incredibly crappy service my husband refuses to set foot in there again and I'll probably never try it."}
{"text":"What a great option at the JW Marriott in Phoenix!   You can never go wrong with the ambience and the food choices at Roy's. Sushi rolls, butterfish, short ribs! Oh man, what do I get?!  This was my first time at this location and it did not disappoint. I ordered the Misoyaki Butterfish, which is hands down one of the best items on the menu. The fish is so tasty and melts in your mouth!   Service was good, although I did see the waitress drop a full wine glass.   Overall, I would definitely dine here again if I stay at the Marriott again."}
{"text":"went to roy's last night! O.M.G.!!i had the roy's trio & it was great! the cocktails were awesome too! u have to try the 1988 its so awesome!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had been to the North Scottsdale location many times and were worried that the Chandler location wouldn't be up to par.  The food was just as amazing and the service was better than the Scottsdale location.  And I didn't have to pay for valet parking (I wish the other location would fix that).  People of Chandler, you finally have a restaurant worth going to, so just suck it up and pay a little more or you won't get another."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Roy's in Waikiki several times.  This was the first shot at the Chandler version.    Overall pretty good.  However, while the server was nice, the service overall was uneven at best, out of sync at worst.  I ordered wine before I finished my salad but it didn't show up until after my main course showed up.  How does that happen?  This is another case where 3.5 is probably where this place ranks, but agin it's not a choice.  That being said, its not a 4 based on the uneven service."}
{"text":"Talk about service!! Brandi the beverage manager completely took care of my parents on their wedding anniversary!  If you are looking for someone special for a romantic occasion in the east valley, this is it!!  Butter fish & Hawaiian martini are to die for!! Will be back"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices.   Four of us went for fabulous food and drinks.  They have a happy hour menu with appetizers and drinks. My favorite was the lobster appetizers.  We had numerous other plates and our bill was not up to a price of a dinner.  The weather was splendid and we sat outside enjoying the peaceful patio setting.  The wait staff were superb, tending to us and keeping a watchful eye for when our drinks got low.  I would recommend dining here."}
{"text":"Absolutely my most favorite restaurant ever. I reserve it for special occasions, but when I do go, the service is 5 out of 5. The entrees are portioned just right and the presentation is wonderful. The overall atmosphere is calm, cool, and collected. There is not too much excitement that is distracting nor is it quiet as a library."}
{"text":"My last visit to Roy's was several years ago when the restaurant was in Scottsdale and event was outstanding. I wish I could say the same about the Desert Ridge location this past weekend. We had reservations and we were sat immediately. The waiter, though okay as far as service and being knowledgeable about the menu, was dressed sloppy and had a dirty shirt. You would think that there would be a dress code for the service people. We ordered and our food came fairly quickly. For the price of the food, it was ho hum. Nothing great to equal the price. We were very disappointed and will not returned. Certainly not up to the standard that Roy's was in the past."}
{"text":"Well, we were underwhelmed with the food as compared to our Roys experience in Hawaii. The shrimp in the Shellfish trio was also off. I am not saying it was bad, just did not taste like the quality we expected. No one item was amazing. And when you spend $200 for 2 and only 1 drink, it should be amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here for a girls night out. We ordered Ahi Tuna for an appetizer and it was absolutely delicious. For entree, I ordered the Prime Rib on the chef menu and it literally melts in my mouth. Service is great for the most part...except our waitress sounds like she is from the military. She made us feel like she is putting us on a strict schedule. \"This is what we've got. What would you like?\"...and when got got our dinner she already wants to puts us on a schedule for dessert. We all felt like she is stressing us out. All in all it was a great experience. We will definitely go back there again"}
{"text":"Service, in a word.... incredible!  We went to Roys to celebrate my wife's birthday, I checked out the reviews on Yelp before we went to Las Vegas and the feedback on Roys was pretty nice. When we arrived and noted our reservation, through Open Table (I noted it was for my wife's birthday), we were greeted and seated right away. The waitress had a short stack of menus and looked like she was on her way to class ;). When we were seated they opened the menu and there was a happy birthday page with my wife's name and a nice quote. Great touch, very personalized! The waiter was very helpful without being overbearing, you know, not checking on us every 10 minutes. Rather we were allowed to enjoy our meal but recieved attention when we gave subtle signals. She ordered the surf n turf, lobster with filet mignon. They cooked her filet to perfection and she said everything was awesome. I had the macadamia encrusted mahi mahi and it was delicious.  Then they brought out a little birthday plate, small fruit and a little cake. That was nice but the cool part was that it had happy birthday and the date written in chocolate on the plate. Again nice touch. When the brought the plate out the waiter took our photo, then came back with photo in a frame with a note on the back. Funny thing, wife's eyes were shut in the photo so we asked if they could take it again and it was no problem!  We had two managers come by and check on us towards the end of the meal. They seemed generally interested and not just going through the motions.  Be prepared to make tough decisions here because there are so many delicious looking items on the menu!  One of my favorite things was that this was off the strip and we didn't feel like we were in the chaos zone known as the strip full of drunk douche bags or the fanny pack army.  If you are in town check this place out!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we thoroughly enjoyed it! We tried the Travelzoo special which enticed us to try the place and we were not disappointed. The Cesar salads were delicious. My husband got the beef spare ribs and I got the teppan shrimp. We liked both dishes. They were even kind enough to get our son a little complimentary snack plate. Service was awesome! I would definitely love to come back to try their other dishes! Keep it up Roy's!"}
{"text":"This resort is top notch- but the service was really just lacking giving the number of guests at the restaurant.  The food is - okay- I just wanted more from the experience I guess.  I live nearby so I will be back. But I can't give it a glowing review."}
{"text":"Another delightful dinner at Roy's.  Never do they fail to impress.  All the dishes here are such an incredible blend of flavors and I look forward to what the chef has decided to make his special. Couple that with fantastic cocktails and you have another enjoyable evening.  I saw some friends there that i had recommended to the restaurant and they were raving and thanking me for sending them there.  I never get tired of eating at this great place."}
{"text":"This spot was not our first choice for dinner as we tried to reserve at multiple restaurants but to no avail as it was the Phoenix Open weekend. Our waiter was very friendly and the setting was romantic and cozy. Started the night off with some cocktails and their version of the Moscow Mule did not disappoint (Drunken Mule). The Beef Short Ribs was full of flavor and very tender. And the perfect ending to the night was the Chocolate Molten Lava Cake."}
