{"text":"I love me a burrito, yessir I do. So I'm just tickled that this place opened up right next door to work. I've been twice now, that's how tickled I am. 

And it's good, but not amazing. It will join my list of non-food court places to eat when I'm too lazy to pack a lunch, but probably wouldn't rate if the location wasn't so good. 

The burritos are big and priced well enough. My bean and cheese (also loaded with rice, salsa, sour cream and peppers) was 7$ or so. The hot is actually HOT - I can taste the habanero. Mmm. Options for fillings include steak, chicken, soy, bean, and 'fajita vegetables', so there's a range of things to suit my every mood (from 'I'm so frikkin hungry I could eat an entire cow' to 'maybe if I eat some vegetables today I'll feel better about myself').

The 'decor' is pretty much the same as when it was a wrap place, nothing with any real personality, but a fair bit of seating space for those who don't eat at their desks. 

The second time I went in I actually ordered a bean and cheese quesadilla, but was presented with a bean and cheese burrito. I didn't mention it, but they do lose a star for poor listening skillz. Friendly, but not so big on the detail work."}
{"text":"Been to this location two times. First time I came around 8pm during a weekday and there was nobody at the counter to take orders. Waited for about 5mins and decided to leave. There was another person waiting while I was there and I assumed he also left shortly after.

Decided to come again since there aren't too many burrito options in Markham. This time there was someone there this time to take orders but was thoroughly disappointed in the food. I ordered the fish burrito and seemed the fish was old or microwaved. The burrito didn't seem fresh at all and did not taste very good. After this experience I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"had the chicken taco's today.. OK.. the burrita was actually pretty good!."}
{"text":"Ordered a steak burrito at Commverce Valley location. Half way into eating it, I found a small piece of plastic paper in the burrito. Needless to say, I will never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that benefits greatly from being in a good location despite mediocre food. I ordered a pulled pork burrito and the person behind the counter put the pork in a bowl and then heated it up in a microwave, which put me off. I have also only ever seen one person behind the counter, taking orders and making them. If there is just one person ahead of you in line that means you are in for a wait. God help us if there is a lineup which, to be honest, I have not yet seen."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both ordered delivery and we got the Vegetarian Soy Burrito in medium heat and they were WAY too hot. My lips are still burning, I like heat but this was too much!! Also, I ordered a Ginger Ale but got a DIET Ginger Ale. The Guacamole was pretty bland, how is that even possible? And the salsa was just too onion-y. The only good thing I can say is the portions are MASSIVE and if you are dying for some burritos and don't feel like paying for a cab to deliver Burrito Boyz go with these guys. Definitely don't see myself ever eating here again."}
{"text":"Had a better than average fast food vegetarian burrito, which was wrapped then lightly grilled. Small diner with a big tv."}
{"text":"Nothing Mexican about this place. The Persian or Afghan staff is very stuck up. If it wasn't for the lunchtime office crowd this place would be out of business"}
{"text":"This place happens to be near my work, so I go here for that Mexican food fix once in a while. It is a bit pricey, but sometimes they have specials that can save you a bit of money. You'll need to go to the actual location to find the specials though as they're not listed on the website. 

We usually call our orders in ahead of time and pick them up 20 mins later. It is hit or miss with this place as they've messed up our called-in orders about 30% of the time. There was one instance where they forgot a whole burrito! 

I usually get the nachos (with ground beef, fully loaded) or sometimes I'll get a naked steak burrito (served in a nacho bowl). These are both pretty big portions, but still could be a little less $ than what they charge. I should also mention that their menu (online and printed) has Extreme Fries, but this Commerce Valley location DOES NOT have Extreme Fries. In case anyone goes there and is thoroughly disappointed as I was :P

The food is good about 80% of the time, but again it's hit or miss and depends what time of the day you go and which day of the week (usually best to go Mon-Thurs, before 12pm or after 2pm).

Barburrito---it's good enough."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch seeing as this was the only burrito joint close by.
I usually frequent the downtown burrito joints like Burrito Boyz, and Big Fat Burrito so I draw a lot of comparisons to them.

When I first walked in the place is relatively small with several tables to dine in. The decor was minimal but overall the seating area and restaurant was tidy and clean. Expect usual fast food service.

They do have some variety in their menu which offers tacos, quesadillas, nachos along with their burritos. I ended up getting a chicken and steak mix burrito, but was disappointed there were no options for additional toppings like in some other popular burrito places (at least I didn't see a list). They also offer a mild, medium, or spicy hot sauce, but don't have different brands of hot sauces to choose from. Final price was ~$10 with a canned pop.

My order was ready pretty quickly within 5 minutes. The burrito itself was large and they are pretty generous with the meat. But the taste was kind of bland and not that great. I've definitely had much better burritos before.

Come here if you are hungry and are looking for a quick burrito fix to fill yourself up, but don't expect to get great or even decent tasting burritos."}
{"text":"Service is quick and employees are kind, however, the vegetarian burrito wasn't very good. Their prices are reasonable but i would rather pay an extra buck for a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"BarBurrito equals blah burrito. To the point in fact that I was astonished when they called themselves authentic Mexican cuisine. 

I had their fish burrito, it was tasteless and filled with wilted lettuce. I hate to beat a dead horse, but what is lettuce doing in a grilled burrito. Making a soggy bed for for their bad fish?? I combined the bad fish with worse guacamole, though I almost daren't call it that as it was more of a cilantro puree. If you enjoy avocado in your guac, you should really go elsewhere.

When I think of Mexican food, I think of a delightful mingling of flavors, hot and spicy with a slight vegetable kick. There was no kick, no oomph in this non-mexican mess. If you don't mind I'd rather not try this one again.

Bottom line..there are so many other much better Mexican options in this city, don't waste your time here"}
{"text":"This BarBurrito changed owners like a year ago and it seems to improved the place.  He is super friendly and chat to you all the time. Even gave me a free pop. I tried most of their burrito and the pulled-pork burrito is pretty damn good. The owner always willing to give me extra gac for no charge.  I also tried the steak and chicken burrito.  The steak is good as well but the chicken is too salty.  I also tried the fries and nachos which was both good.  This might not be authenic Mexican food but I do not think I ever had authenic Mexican food so I cannot comment, but I do know that BarBurrito is pretty good for a quick snack.  I def be back espically to show support to the new owner which is honest and super friendly."}
{"text":"This is a decent tex-mex option in the Bay/College area. I would rather eat here than any of the options in the food courts around this part of the downtown, for sure.

The place is clean, the ingredients are fresh and well-prepared and service is quite prompt. (One note: if you have special requests for the order make them very clear at the start so they're noted on the post-it.) I think the prices are maybe $1-2 more than they should be, but the portions are really reasonable (a regular sized burrito leaves me stuffed).

For vegetarians and vegans - make sure to ask for vegetarian refried beans. For vegans: specify no dairy at all; I contacted the company to ask about the 'soy' option for the burritos and tacos, and it's vegan too.

Their guac is really nice, flavoured with cilantro leaves and just the right amount of garlic. You can have chips w/ a guac side, and it all goes very nicely with a grapefruit Jarritos, let me tell you. Great lunch option for those of us who don't want Subway."}
{"text":"In all my travels, which includes Los Angeles, I have never eaten a better steak burrito or quesadilla. We ate there two days in a row while doing work in the area. The steak is seasoned so salty delicious. You have the option to add green onions, cilantro, corn, jalapenos, diced tomatos and a few other great toppings. I was happy I realized they put lettuce on as a standard so I could have them leave that off."}
{"text":"We were looking for burritos in Markham and this place came to mind. The last time we drove by, however, it was closed because it was a Sunday. Unfortunate, but I thought we'd give it a shot again.

Checked the website, said it was open until 9pm so I called ahead to order. Rang and went to voicemail and by that time, we were pulling in to Commerce Valley. It's a Saturday evening so the parking lot isn't the quickest to navigate through (especially when you're starving!) but when we finally got there, the sign said closed! It was before 8:30 pm so it definitely should've still been open or at least had a message on the voicemail and/or site if they were closing early for the day. JMO but if I happen to drive by and it actually happens to be open next time, I'll review my rating."}
{"text":"Listen, options are pretty limiting in this area in terms of non asian cuisine. I'm a huge Mexican food lover, and I knew this wasn't going to be like the commercialized toronto based burrito boyz, and knew even more so less likely the tacos would be anything like La Carnita but was hoping for something at least authentic.

Ingredients were fresh, I has the fish haddock burrito and it was ok, my boyfriend has the quesadilla and said it was just ok.

If you're dying for Mexican it will fulfill the void - but you're still better to drive the 20 minutes to the city to do it right."}
{"text":"Ordered catering service for a team of 25 people. 

There is an online form that you can print and email to them. It was very easy to use and I emailed it to them. I spoke to the person who was in charge and he advised during lunch time- he is the busiest and cannot deliver. We arranged for someone to pick it up from work. 

However- when the delicious burrito and quesadila's arrived. One burrito out of 21 was missing. 

We called back and the owner/manager Arash told me that he is short-staffed and if we can send someone. However it being the busiest time of the year hence we all ordered in. WE said we cant. Arash called me back to tell me he is on his way. He drove down within half an hr and dropped off the burrito's.

The part that made me feel guilty is that he said he shut down his store in order to make it happen.

Great Customer service. Thanks for not letting one of my co-workers be the odd one left out without food!"}
{"text":"I HAVE MET MY MATCH! Sometimes, it's better to take the cook's word for it!

After work, I stopped by Bar Burrito to pick up a taco salad. I've been meaning to try it since I keep walking pass the Yonge Street location, so I was pleasantly surprised to see it on Bay Street. 

They offer a variety of taco salads, obviously I went for the vegetarian salad -but I made it vegan by omitting the cheese. \" The taco salad comes in a white taco shell bowl -which is a bummer for me because I like whole wheat taco shells, but it was still good, with fresh romaine lettuce and crumbled nacho chips on top. Unlike my favourite taco salad place, Mucho Burrito, Bar Burrito does not have a great variety of ingredients to top the salad with, for example, Bar Burrito only has one type of salsa, while Mucho Burrito has three. Bar Burrito's salad also does not come with black beans or pinto beans, but to make up for that, their taco salad comes with soy.... meaning fake meat... which wasn't bad at all. Another bummer, Bar Burrito charges you for guaccamole, while Mucho Burrito doesn't, obviously that disappointed me because I love avocados! 

Despite the lack of variety of ingredients, Bar Burrito's salad was pleasantly satisfying. The cook was very generous with the fake meat and the ingredients that they did have, such as corn, tomatoes, and green peppers. What surprised me was their hot sauce. I most def have met my match today. I had asked for hot sauce to go on my salad because I love spicy food and eat hot sauce with almost everything. And unlike most places with \"hot\" sauce, Bar Burrito's hot sauce was actually really, really spicy. O-M-G!!! The cook/ server had warned me when I asked for their hottest sauce (they have a milder hot sauce) and said it was REALLY hot. I naturally scoffed and actually flung my head back, laughed and asked him to load it up because I've never really had a hot sauce that made me gasp for water... and to me, if I'm not gasping for water, then it ain't hot. However, not only did I gasp for water, my face actually went NUMB while eating and I could feel the sauce BURNING the inside of my stomach. And to add fire to the damage, I tried to put out the burning within my tummy with orange juice -tremendously horrible move on my part because orange juice is acidic! I'd thought the sweetness would calm my stomach down. I knew milk would have helped, but dammit, I'm vegan! 

I would most def come back to Bar Burrito for a salad, even though their salad is more expensive than Mucho Burritos', it doesn't come with a whole wheat shell, they lack a variety of ingredients and their hot sauce can do real damage and my stomach may need to lay off hot sauce and cayenne pepper for the next few days... it was just good and having another place to go to for a taco salad (that comes in a taco shell bowl) is always a good thing."}
{"text":"This is down the street from my work, so one day a few of us ordered this for the first time along with another coworker who's eaten there before. I had ordered the chicken and steak quesadilla, and honestly, it was so good! It comes with some salsa and sour cream on the side, which I didn't expect, so it was a nice surprise. The ingredients were fresh and the whole thing was really flavorful. I'll definitely be back.

Also, if you happen to work in the area and place several orders, you can ask if they would be willing to deliver."}
{"text":"Someone please tell me why I insist on finding good Mexican food in Toronto??? It's just not going to happen!!! So disappointing. For the first time in a very very long time, I wanted a refund. Why is it that people believe they can just open up a restaurant (because they have some money lying around or something), make up their own version of what they call \"ethnic and authentic\" and screw  the consumers? I have said this before \"google it\"! My goodness, for your prices, the least you could do is made the salsas.

This place is an IMITATION EVERYTHING!! imitation/substitute salsa, imitation chips, imitation rice, imitation taco shells........ everything they have is either canned stuff or something that come out of a box. ALL of the items are substituted with crap. NO BUENO AMIGOS! I know times are tough, but if you want to stay in business, start cooking. Mexican food is not meant to come out of a freezer a can or box. Get with the program people!"}
{"text":"There were 2 people in front of me. They didn't order anything special. I had to wait 20 min before their order was complete. Another 10 min for my order. Definitely  not worth my time. 

The burrito itself was not anything special. 

Could've gone to the Sobeys, bought my own ingredients, went back to my office and made my own, tastier burrito"}
{"text":"I got the chicken nacho burrito for ~$8.  I thought it was pretty good.  I wish it was a little warmer on the inside.  It's a huge burrito, so the inside was not a warm as I would like.  For the price, taste, and portion, it's a pretty good deal.  There were Chinese people eating there, and I've never seen Chinese people eat Mexican food in my life, so it must be good."}
{"text":"My advice, go to Taco Bell instead.  From the look and taste of all my food, half of these items can be bought at costco.  In fact, I would not be surprised if this was owned by Costco and they are simply serving food they sell there.

Not in a million years would I call this Mexican food.  It has a menu that reflects mexican food items but seriously there's nothing half decent about the taste of this food.   

Sorry, but quest for half decent mexican food in Toronto is still turning up ZERO results.  

I had \"3 steak hardshell tacos\" and the \"chips and guacamole\".   I'll post pics.  Don't be fooled.  They walk and talk like mexican food but they sooo don't taste anything like it."}
{"text":"The burritos here are pretty good and reasonably priced.  

The steak and chicken burritos are more or less standard affair, however the truly unique item on the menu would have to be the pulled pork burrito.  Not only is the pork delicious and tender, but it's also great to have a different option instead of always going for steak and chicken burritos.  A large burrito here will probably end up costing you around $9, so the prices are fairly average.  The service is usually pretty good, the burritos are made quickly and the staff is attentive and well mannered."}
{"text":"The place advertises that there's fish / chorizo burrito and I love both choices but when I asked he said shipment wasn't not in yet therefore none of the choices available and took away the sign. Ended up getting a chicken mild everything burrito. Still good but still want to try fish or chorizo next time! I tried the fish burrito second time i went there it took quite a while to cook the fish it might be because I went there during weekend and it was not busy? Fish burrito was not bad."}
{"text":"If you have to work in this area, you know how crap the food options are. BarBurrito is pretty darn good. 

I came in after work tonight on a whim because I knew I didn't have much in my fridge expect beer and maybe some baby carrots. The guy working there was hilarious and we talked for awhile because he was bored. He gave me a free pop, too. 

As far as the burrito goes, it's pretty flavourful and the flavours were pretty well balanced. I ordered medium spice I can  taste the fresh hot peppers. It's not the best burrito ever but it's good. IMHO it's better than Big Fat Burrito, which I find tastes wildly different with every bite and is the only burrito competitor in the area."}
{"text":"Had a large chicken burrito form her a few times and it's nothing to rave about which is why I had never reviewed it I'm the past. It's not horrible but there's way better Mexican food in the area so I never found the need to review it. After my last experience there I really did find the need to review it, there was RAW CHICKEN in my burrito. You've got to be kidding me you can't even throughly cook chicken! Thank god my friend noticed the chicken inside my burrito was raw or I could have gotten extremely sick. Honestly if you can't even cook chicken your business shouldn't even be open. I hope this seriously makes people consider going to this place, raw chicken in a burrito is just plan awful and I don't even know how this place hasn't been busted by healthy and safety."}
{"text":"I had a seminar to conduct followed by one-on-ones today for a client in Markham.

I don't know Markham but came across Barburrito for lunch. I love burritos so thought I'd check it out.

It's in a strip of restaurants on Commerce Valley Drive, just west of the DVP.

They have a variety of burritos, tacos, quesadillas, nachos, etc.   I ordered a large chicken burrito (minus lettuce, sour cream and guacamole) and a Coke Zero.

It's not a cozy spot at all.  In fact, I had walked in and then out again, considered going to the burger joint next door.  But looking at the amount of people at tables and in line, I thought I'd go ahead and try it after all ... and I'm glad I did.

My burrito was big and delicious!  I had it medium spicy and there was some kick in spots.

The servers were efficient but cold.

So I give this place low marks for decor and service but high marks for the food. I'd go back there for another burrito."}
{"text":"A decent new burrito place at Bay and College. It's no Burrito Boyz but it gets the job done. I went with my usual Bean & Cheese Burrito ($6.50).

The size was impressively big, especially given the relatively low price. Toppings were fairly predictable: refried beans, rice, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, green pepper, and corn. As for sauces, I wasn't so impressed by the guacamole, but there was plenty of sour cream, burrito sauce, salsa, and hot sauce to (almost) make up for this.

Unlike a lot of burrito joints there was a good amount of flavour and spice going on in this burrito. It almost felt like they stole their burrito sauce recipe from Burrito Boyz and that's not a bad thing.

My only real complaint is that this was probably the messiest burrito I've ever eaten. It basically exploded before I took the first bite. Perhaps they need better tortillas.

The space looks like your typical fast food joint, i.e. not much character, but it is clean and there's lots of seating."}
{"text":"Special on weekends. One burrito for $5 if you buy a drink. One pop plus chicken burrito came to $7.12. The food here is not great, but it is not bad either. It's annoying how the keep the sauces behind the counter. If you want more salsa (I love green salsa), asked them to put some in a container for you. They also close really early. It was closed at 9pm on a Saturday!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this just as I Ieave this burrito place behind as my friendly-next-door fast food option for a new neighbourhood, but our last experience was pretty bad.  

We normally get the fish burritos, which have proven a consistently tasty choice.  Informed that they were out of fish last week, I ordered the bfff a chicken burrito, which was so horribly over-salted he could not finish it, and even after one bite of it, this incurable sodium addict experienced salt sweats.  

Another recent adventure for fish burritos yielded a friend and I downing probably a couple litres of water each from the spice level (both of us are very comfortable with a lot of spice).  It truly seemed like an error, not a deliberate choice to include that much heat, since I only ordered medium spice, and because this is supposed to be a burrito, not a serving of chicken wings that servers ring a big bell for finishing.  

With these as our most recent experiences, I'm left to wonder if the production quality is on the downturn.  I'd say they need to revisit the labels on the measuring spoons in the kitchen.  I want to root for this place to keep it from being supplanted by another Starbucks or something--so hopefully they will check themselves asap."}
{"text":"BarBurrito is a pretty standard Mexican grill just North of Gerrard on the West side of Bay street. They serve burritos, quesadillas, hard tacos, nachos and something called \"extreme fries\". I can only assume these fries base jump and drink Mountain Dew.

It's pretty spacious with about 25-30 seats but I probably wouldn't hang out here. Very fast-foodish. I wasn't offended by my chorizo burrito, but I wasn't blown away either. And at almost $8, I should be somewhat impressed. I was happy with the spice level though, and the toppings were definitely fresh. 

I probably wouldn't go out of may to come here, but it seems like a reasonable lunch option for people who work nearby. They take debit and credit.

Obligatory Title Pun: Bar-bar-bar, bar-BarBurrito!

Menu Readability: Classic backlist over-the-counter sign.

Need to mention: They flip your burrito to grill each side of your burrito separately. This takes forever.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'm less extreme than certain fried potato products."}
