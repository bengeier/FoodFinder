{"text":"When I learned that Anise Cafe was closed I about died! I'm sure a lot of people felt the same way. When I found out they just changed name and new location I was jumping off the wall! Why? It's simple The food is delicious, outstanding service!, pleasant environment!  I am now a happy happy person!"}
{"text":"A nice spot to get some Vietnamese food. I had the house soup and it was quite good. The owner and staff are very friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"I love their pho I have order beef pho 3 times now and each time more delicious than the last! I love it here, a little hard to find since its inside the city hall building but once you find it you'll love it. Its clean!!! And the food is made to order and fresh"}
{"text":"This place is permanently CLOSED. This place is permanently CLOSED.  Closed. Closed. Closed.  Yelp wouldn't let me just write on  sentence."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. This is inside the court house so WHO KNEW!! This place is a must!! What amazing Tai food I was blown away from the flavor the broth the way each ingredient had its individuality even tho it sat in a bowl of broth. I could not get enough. This is a mom AN pop place Ann the owner came out and greeted us and was very sweet. The spring rolls were fresh and one bite as delicious as the next. I will definitely go back next time I am in Peoria. Make sure you go early as they keep court hours. Do not let the fact that they are in a court house deter you from going. Happy Eating."}
{"text":"This place is located inside Peoria City Hall, and I wish I work there so I can eat this every day! Jk...I'd be broke.  Food-excellent! I was surprised. Normally food places inside a company building aren't that great, but this was! I don't remember the name of what I got, but it was this soup noodle. Both were very delicious, and everything on the menu looked good.  The place was very clean, and the owners were very nice. Parking was easy to find; they have a guest parking in the back and it's a close walk to the cafe. I would definitely go back. Go try it out!!"}
{"text":"Out of this world Pho. Great service. Clean restaurant. Perfect in all aspects except....  It is in the City Hall building so this means they keep City of Peoria hours at 7am-3pm Monday-Thursday. So unless you can get here for a lunch you will likely have a hard time expericing this well hidden gem.   I am thankful we have found this place though because me and the Wife have a great little Pho spot for lunch right in the neighborhood. If you can, do yourself a favor and check this place out for lunch if you are in the downtown Peoria area."}
{"text":"Very pleasant lunch in a super clean in the chrerful environmrnt of the Peoria City Hall. Greeted with many smiles and suggestions for my lunch. I tried the banh mi (I am not sure of spelling),  sandwich with chicken and it was great. The chewey bread filled with chicken,  pickled carrot, daikon and cilantro with a sauce worked well together. I will go back to try more of their menu at this hidden gem. Try it ss you will too be a fan"}
{"text":"I had a huge craving for some really good wonton soup! Used yelp to help me find some around this area & I discovered this little hidden gem. This cafe is inside of the city hall building.   I ordered wonton soup & also added noodles to it! I believe the wonton are homemade. The meat inside of them are so well seasoned. The portion of the soup was pretty decent for the price. The egg noodles really added a nice touch to the soup. Although the broth was slightly a little too sweet for my liking. Overall the soup really hit the spot for me!"}
