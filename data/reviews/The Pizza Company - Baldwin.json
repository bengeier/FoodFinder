{"text":"I live in Ohio but visit Pittsburgh on a regular basis. Everytime I visit I order pizza from The Pizza Company - my family and I love it! Their food is top quality and their customer and delivery is second to none. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a takeout order (ready in time specified) and got an Italian hoagie and a cheesesteak/steak hoagie. Both were superb. The guy running the joint was friendly. What more could a hungry fella ask for? I'd definitely return. I'm curious about the pizza, but the hoagies are a \"go\"!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is great but a little on the greasy side. Love their hot wings just be sure to ask for sauce on the side. Sometimes they come with only a little sauce and other times they're drowning in it."}
{"text":"Not pleased with the large mushroom extra sauce pizza I ordered which cost me near $16.00. I don't mind paying any amount for a good pizza but this one was far from that. Almost no sauce, plain tasting & maybe 5 mushrooms on the whole pie. Not a happy customer. Will not be back to this place."}
{"text":"The food is extremely overpriced. $15 for what looked like a small pizza. 8 tiny slices. When I called to ask if they sent me the wrong pizza, I was hung up on. I called back and the manger told me that she hung up on me \"because it was Friday night and they are busy\". Then she had the nerve to comment that I didn't tip the person that delivered the food. The reason I didn't tip is because I didn't get a bill! I don't keep cash on hand all of the time. I tip very well, but I've never not received a bill to sign. This is the worst experience I have ever had with a pizza shop. We will NEVER order here again & would not recommend them to anyone. Extremely rude manager & way overpriced food. I told them to come back and get their food & they refused."}
{"text":"The Greek salad is the best salad you can get from a pizza place, maybe any place. This is the forth or fifth one I've gotten, the lettuce is always fresh, generous amount of feta cheese and olives. Pizza and hoagie are great too"}
{"text":"Just moved back to south hills, so it has been my mission to find the best pizza places around. i'm still searching but I think this is definitely one of my top choices. Really good stuff, all of it. The dough is cooked perfect, soft inside. Good cheese blend, do i detect cheddar? Great wings, nice n crispy, a little small though. Like little baby chickens, maybe midget chickens. Check it out"}
