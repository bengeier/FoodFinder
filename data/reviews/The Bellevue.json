{"text":"As a chocolate addict, I was intrigued by the chocolate-banana-jalapeño juice. Also ordered were the honeydew-avocado-banana and a lemonade made with crushed mint leaves and sugar cane. ($4)  I liked them all - the lemonade was the most refreshing for the hot day, but I enjoyed the banana-chocolate- jalpeno flavour the most. With a consistency that's more shake-y than juice-y (makes sense given the ingredients), I enjoyed a jalapeño \"bite\" after each chocolately slurp. I wish they used a darker chocolate instead though - I think that the stronger cacao taste would go really well with the jalapeño.  The honeydew-avocado-banana was light, sweet and also on the thicker side. Next time, I think I will ask for some ice cubes in my drink even though it will dilute it a bit more just to keep it cold.  The Squirrel ($10) Peanut butter, sardines, hot chili sauce, cucumber, sprouts and white cheddar on dark rye How could I not order this? The combination of salty, buttery, cheesy, and spicy was pretty darn good. I just wish there was more! At $10 though, it's not bad considering the big bowl of soup that came with it.  I'd love to try this with a few slices of tomato and avocado. My friend disagrees saying that it's just make it too soggy but I think it'd be great. I think I will request that addition next time, if possible. I like tomatoes on everything though...  The Beach ($10) Chick pea salad, roasted coconut, yakinori, sesame, sprouts, and cheddar on dark rye Not bad, a decent healthy sandwich. The chickpeas were chickpeas, the sprouts were sprouts - I got exactly what I ordered. While tasty, I won't be craving it anytime soon and I'd sooner try something else off of their menu.  The Fish Fry ($14) Golden fried Ontario Rainbow Trout, with a dandelion & avocado mixed green salad, white vinaigrette. The Rainbow Trout was well done, although I wish there was more to the salad. I wonder how much it would have cost to upgrade to the Greens with Envy salad? Purple kale, dandelion, cucumber, green onion, sprouts, and broccoli sounds pretty darn good.  The following two items come with sandwiches, or you can order them separately. Soupe de Soleil ($4) The butternut squash and was thick, filling, and satisfying. I actually like my squash soups a bit chunky so I was quite happy with this homey bowl. There was also a bit of tomato & scallions and possibly carrot, if I recall correctly. Yum.  Black Beans ($6) The black bean dip with avocado was also tasty with the red tortilla chips. Dense and chunky, the bowl was spooned clean. I wished there were a few more large chips in the pile, but no biggie - I just scooped some dip with my spoon with the little chip bits. In hindsight, I think I would've liked this in the sandwich too!  Julies' Pies! Ooh...pie. With Wanda's Pie in the Sky down the street I was surprised to see \"Julies' Pie\" for dessert. I racked my poor memory for a bakery named Julie's and drawing a blank, I asked where/who Julie('s) is. It turns out that one of the owner's (Ryan) cousin's wife bakes yummy desserts for their cafe. Talk about family love :) It was a sweltering hot day, but he convinced me that the pie was \"reaaaalllly good\" with a knowing \"omg\" look on his face. Not that my sweet tooth ever needs much convincing anyways.  And \"reaaaallly good\" it was! Totally catering to my not-so-secret love affair with Ontario peaches, the filling was just the right amount of sweet and the crust (which I think is just as important!) was nice and soft. While my friend said he would've preferred more of a \"bite\" for both the peaches and the crust, I was quite satisfied as I liked the super-soft pieces of fruit. Mmmm. It wasn't syrupy or overloaded with sugar. This pie-lover was satisfied.  The service from co-owner Chris was very friendly and conversational. I heard they were going to offer fish tacos at yesterday's Pedestrian Sundays however a combination of a precarious weather forecast and something about the cousin who was going to cook 'em up made it a no-go. I must have looked crest-fallen as I got a consoling tap on the shoulder from Ryan (is it creepy that I'm using their first names as if I know them?) and a promise of their appearance on August 29th's Pedestrian Sunday. Sadly I will be out of town, but as a fanatic of Little Italy's Fish Store, at least I know where to get my fish-fix. Pout.  Overall, I had a good time at The Bellevue. While there were some things that I would like to tweak, everything tasted good and homey. The items are things that I could easily make at home, but the creative combinations certainly stirred my imagination. It won't be long before I start making my own Sardine-Nut Butter-Rye sandwiches...which may or may not be pleasant for The Bellevue to hear!"}
{"text":"So we decided to try this place out since we had a friend visiting from out of town who was already around Kensington.   The service wasn't too bad, but the food took over an hour to come out to us since the place was heaving.  Pretty understandable given the size of the kitchen. I had the El Especial and the scrambled eggs were quite nice, cheesy and creamy like described.   The salsa and sausages were a little bland, but wasn't too bad.   The wife and our friend both had the fish fry and were kinda left asking where the rest of the fish was, but what do you expect for the price?  All in the all, not great.. but not too bad.  Ended up picking up pork rolls from chinatown because wife and friend weren't entirely satisfied."}
{"text":"Expensive, and mediocre... We went for breakfast, and all three of ordered different things. Mine was a standard breakfast. It was good, don't get me wrong, but I could get the same thing for half the price from the all day breakfast place across the street."}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest brunch spots ive seen in a while. the decor, the wait staff , just the vibe is awesome. The brunch menu is very eclectic and the presentation is fantastic. I loved the food although Im a huge eater so my only complaint was that the brunch mains arent massive although i eat more than the average person. total came to 20$ including tax and tip . i love the vibe of this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a such a great find.  I wandered around Kensington Market for awhile on a Saturday evening looking for any place that was open past 7pm.  My friend and i happened to wander past this place, and i'm certainly glad we did.  The atmosphere is cozy, laid-back and cute.  I would say it is a unpretentious hipster hang-out.  The first thing i thought was - wow, this place would be great for a date!  Its got that dim-lighting, warm feeling that i dig, but the music ISN'T blaring, which means you can actually hear what your company is saying!  The staff are also really friendly, service is excellent.  I should have pre-faced this with the fact that i did not actually Eat anything from their menu, so i'm not sure of their food.  I can say that the food menu looks expensive-ish, but good quality/fancy.  There is also decent-priced beers ranging from 5.50 and up for what i'm assuming is a pint.  The glasses of wine go for 7$.  I had the best tea ever here, its called \"toasty almond\" and it is amazing.    The bathrooms are in the basement; are clean and cozy."}
{"text":"A wise person once told me that great is always different (e.g. Picasso) but different isn't always great (e.g. Andy Dick).   In the case of The Bellevue Diner, it's both different and great. I had their eponymous Bellevue sandwich ($12): blackened snapper, thick-cut meaty ham, cheddar, Swiss, tomato and onion on a Kaiser roll. I would've never thought to put such disparate elements together but the salty ham and cheese perked up the mild fish in a way that was unexpected but totally scrumptious.  All their sammies come with a choice of soup, salad or black beans/avocado/tortilla chips. I opted for the day's soup of watermelon gazpacho because I am a sucker for chilled soups (and because my two melanin-deprived dining companions snagged the shady seats on the patio and left me to broil in the sun so I needed something cold and refreshing). It did not disappoint.  If you go, I dare you to try The Squirrel sandwich ($10): peanut butter, sardines, cheddar, sprouts; then tell me if it's worth enduring sprouts for. I've already got my eye on the egg salad-gorgonzola sandwich for my next visit. They also serve pastas, a fish fry entree, and three dishes for their all-day breakfast, two of which are vegetarian. It is Kensington Market, after all. Nothing is over $14.  Service was sweet, friendly, and leisurely. The space is small and intimate with just a few outdoor tables under patio umbrellas. Overall, this place is cute...different...and great!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE - ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES OR SENSITIVITIES.  I finally tried this restaurant despite hearing poor reviews of this place.  My boyfriend had enjoyed his meal there previously and convinced me to go.  Upon ordering, I alerted my server that I have a severe strawberry allergy.  (I didn't specify that this allergy causes me to swell like a balloon for anywhere from 3 months to possibly a year.)    When I received my brunch and started eating the salad, I tasted what I thought to be strawberries.  I quickly called the server over and asked him what type of dressing was on the salad.  He came back and told me berries.  I asked him if that included strawberries.  His answer to my question (after having to return to the kitchen) was \"Yes.  Definitely strawberries.\"  I told him that I needed to rush out for allergy meds and left. My boyfriend settled up his part of the bill but said that I wouldn't be paying for mine since I didn't get to eat my meal.  The server had the nerve to try and charge for some orange juice which I also didn't get to enjoy!  I received no apologies!!!  The server casually told my boyfriend \"I hope your girlfriend feels better\".  Feels better?!!  I'm lucky that I didn't go into anaphylactic shock!!!"}
{"text":"hey guy who just picked up the phone. No need to be a sarcastic dick. I thought you were called the Bellevue Diner. it was an honest mistake-  If I ask if you can seat 7 people you don't have to say \" well maybe if we were open\" I do not know your hours, hence the phone call.  The snobby attitude says \"dont eat here\" loud and clear."}
{"text":"We are continuing our search for good weekend brunch places with something different to offer.  The Bellevue Cafe in Kensington Market was promising and for the most part, it delivered.  We both had the special brunch dish, with scrambled eggs, tomatillo salsa, black bean sauce and crispy tortillas.  The salsa and black beans were well flavoured, the coffee was strong and bold.  Service was excellent, friendly and attentive. Keep in mind that it is a small, neighborhood restaurant and the patio is tiny, with 3 tables.  Not really a place to relax and chat with friends. Convenient Green P lot just down the street."}
{"text":"Turns out, walking down Bellevue Street was one of my best decisions of the day. I literally stumbled upon The Bellevue. We didn't even know the name of this establishment because only a mysterious exclamation point graces the storefront signage.   Seating inside was limited and when it was suggested that my friend and I crunch up at the bar by the door, we opted out for the patio. It was surprisingly full for a November day, but there was still plenty of room. Very cute wooden tables and chairs. Menus were scarce so we had to share, NBD.   We ordered coffees and they were quite strong! Very good with the provided cream and the raw sugar. Bringing us stirring spoons was mentioned, but they never did make it to the table.   I got the omelette of the day which included three types of fancy mushrooms, caramelized red onions, and goat cheese. Basically, my mouth is watering as I write this. It came with bacon, a mixed green salad, red chilies in oil, a few roasted cherry tomatoes and buttered sour dough bread from Woodlot. Mouth is still watering. I love Woodlot and I loved using their bread as a vehicle to put all of the above on one slice. Everything was amazingly fresh and was only more delectable when I put it all together. My only qualm was that the omelette was pretty runny, and my preference does not align with runny eggs.  However, they did not scrimp on any of the mentioned ingredients and I'm excited to see what other combinations they come up with.   I'm not sure who our server was. There were so many people helping us out! Hopefully the tip went to the right person, though I'm not certain on who that person is. For two omelettes and two coffees, with tax and tip, the bill came to a cool $20 per person. I found it to be worth it and I look forward to a dinner and eating in the coziness of inside."}
{"text":"mmmm mmm mmm ; o ... felt like I was in burger heaven while eating the homemade burger here.  They took the time to actually butter toast each side of the bun and slit the bun open ---as opposed to cutting it in two halves--- so the juices don't spill out from the bottom and so that you can get every last bit of yummyness from this oh sooo good burger.  What more can I say? : ]  I came here for dinner on a Friday.  The dinner menu only has a few items, but from what I could tell from my meal and the meals of my friends, whatever they do make they make very well.  The meat in my burger was juicy yet smokey and combined with the perfect amount of blue cheese, the two jalapeno peppers and the flakey buttery bun it was a deeeliiiciiious mixture.     Whatever this burger lacked in size (because it was no too big) it made up for and more in flavour.   Very simple yet very very tasty, just the way a burger should be.  On parr with a Utopia burger... although come to think of it, I think I can actually say that I enjoyed this even a little more : /... : D  Bonus: the ambience is very cozy and unique without trying too hard to be hip or trendy... a clean and not purposefully grungy looking place like some of the other restaurants in Kensington.  Plus, the service was excellent.  A warm and friendly waiter who answered all of our questions with ease and to top that the chef came out in a nonchalant way to our table to personally ask us what we thought of the food, made me feel like I was eating at a friend's house.   A very nice experience at a down to earth place with personality : )))"}
{"text":"Great to meet up with ol' friends once again.  This place had good reviews. We were a little worried that it would be too bohemian for us with loud boogie woogie music. But the owners and staff couldn't have been more accommodating and friendly.  Grasshopper wheat ale Beer ordered as we walked in. Music too loud? Speakers turned lower.  Food not what ordered, quickly replaced. Kimchi pancakes were the special and they were delicious batter with spicy cabbage built in. Veggie friendly with soy cream cheese.  Plenty of bacon for the non-believers."}
{"text":"The Bellevue located on the corner of Bellevue in Kensington market is a sweet little cafe.  It is very simple, quaint and old-fashioned.  The restaurant boasts hardwood floors, wood tables, graffiti street art on the brick walls exterior, a charming bar and a nice outdoor patio.  The bar menu is pretty great.  They have some unusual beverages-like pimm's and hot mulled wine.  The food menu is also pretty creative.  I sample the charcuterie plate and it was delightful.  The cheese selection paired wonderfully with the meat and preserves and it was well priced.  The service was fantastic and our server was incredibly charming.  Plus he did not make fun of me when I ordered a hot chocolate when all of my friends were ordering alcoholic beverages.  Nobody puts The Bellevue in a corner!"}
{"text":"I'm really trying to remember all the details of my brunch at the Bellevue this morning but, in truth, all I can think about is the bacon.  I think I might actually have a crush on the Bellevue's bacon.  Maple-y.  Tender yet crispy.  Generous.  Smokey.  Everything else was pretty darn good, but I would go back just for a plate of that pork.  (And did I mention it's local and well-sourced?)  Now I'm blushing.  We were welcomed by an earnest waiter (Toronto hipsters are so polite!) who gave us delicious, creamy americanos and gave us lots of advice on what to order.  I opted for the omelette of the day (filled with roasted peppers, sweet caramelized onions, whole basil leaves and a hit of goat's cheese) that was generously served with fresh bread, avocado, tomato, homemade hot peppers and...did I mention the bacon?  My husband's veggie version of the El Special (cheesy eggs, tortillas, black beans and salsa) was decent but, as happens with so many veggie substitutions, it was a little meagre without the meat, yet they charged the same amount.  Always a bit of a bummer.  Overall, a very good experience.  The kitchen is a little slow, though, so bring a magazine to read or just watch the Kensington activity passing by.  Vegetarian score: 6.5/10.  Some good options, but it's a crime vegetarians have to miss out on that bacon."}
{"text":"You want to be chill, eat a fairly healthy meal, and check out the pink bath loofah hanging from the power lines? Go here!   Kat \"me say no to meat\" F., Susan \"meat lover\" C., and I had brunch today at The Bellevue Diner.   Opened just 4 weeks, we decided to check the joint out and see what this new place had to offer.   With sandwiches named \"The Squirrel\", I knew I had to test this place out. Meat eater Susan and I had the Bellevue. As someone who doesn't eat a whole lot of fish (hello....it ain't red meat!!!!) but should, I decided to step out of my usual flow and go for it. The fact that it had pork with it, its like bacon on your bacon - all good.   The menu is small, but I actually prefer that. Why have 30 items that are all sub-par, when you can have 10 that are great. This is how you run a restaurant. This spot does not have fries and burgers, again, it is much more on the healthier side. You won't leave feeling like you have been pumped full of salt and carbon.   When I go back next time, I want to try one of their avocado drinks!   This spot used to be two stores, and combined to form the Diner. No liquor license yet, but it is in the works.   The staff are friendly (bonus points for the guy who made my yummy latte and sported a red handkerchief around his neck!!) and pretty attentive. For a place that has only been open for 4 weeks, it was pretty busy on a Friday afternoon.  Note they take all forms of payment (except for Canadian Tire money, I asked)."}
{"text":"Really good brunch spot.  I had one bad experience in the winter when the only seating was indoors and they were blasting music really loud and it was only 11am. My friends and I were hungover  which made it more uncomfortable and had to yell at each other across the table, and eventually gave up on having a functional conversation. Every other time I've been has been great.  I've been for dinner and sat on the patio and the server didn't mind coming outside even when it was raining a bit (we were under an umbrella).  The burgers are great, fish tacos are good but on the small side, and their sangria is the work of 48 hours of alcohol infusing labour - they even give the berries a booze bath. I've been for brunch multiple times, everyone always enjoys the smoked salmon and guac bagel and their london fog. I took my 74 year old grandmother and my mother and they like it more than I do.  The patio is really nice in the summer, just bring sunglasses as some of the tables dont have umbrellas"}
{"text":"\"Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free; Take a load off Fannie, And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me.\"  I've been championing this place for the past 8 months so my review may be a little biased. I'm not in any shape or form connected to the restaurant I just really believe in what they stand for and am a supporter of local, passionate restauranteurs.   The Bellevue offers brunch, lunch and dinner. They're actually opened for most (or all?) of the night. Well at least thats what I was told the last time I was there. Three friends own the joint and work there everyday. (well most, we all need a break) They are incredibly passionate and it shows in their food and commitment to the place.  Food I've been a dozen times for breakfast and sadly only once for dinner but I plan to head back soon. They recently launched their new dinner menu with specials for every day of the week.  Find them on facebook and 'like' their group. You'll get updates on their menu daily. You can't go wrong with anything on the brunch menu, Everyone who has ever gone has been impressed and fully satisfied. Get the fresh squeezed orange juice- It's actually fresh squeezed. The coffee's are stiff and their smoothies can be hit and miss. Must orders Brunch: El Especial, The Surfista, Steak and Eggs and The Squirrel. There's so many positive reviews about these so I don't think I should blab on.  Dinner- I went on one of their first nights and was pleased all around but I'd like to try some of their other options before going all out on the review.  Price - it's a little steep for the neighbourhood but once you taste the quality in their food you know it's worth every dollar  Location The location is superb. Away from the chaos of the main streets and still oozing in all of the charm you expect from Kennsignton. The location hugs a corner street and is surrounded by trees and the locals who live in the area. During the summer, some locals would come by and play on the old piano and the owners would come outside to mingle with friends and patrons.  I confidently recommend Bellevue. Can't wait to return for dinner!"}
{"text":"This place was just alright for me. I've heard amazing things. But the steak and eggs I ordered was pretty bland and so was the breakfast special my girlfriend ordered.  The caesar was great. They made a good latte too. But the food was nothing to call home about."}
{"text":"Short and sweet review!  I love coming here for any meal. The menu is seasonal and always tasty, and reasonably priced. The staff is great and service has always been awesome.  When in the area, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and each time the food is phenomenal! I only wish I could afford to eat out more often :)"}
{"text":"First off, The Bellvue's website is not up to date. Their Happy Hours no longer exist. No more $4 pints and $4 charcuterie plates. I had to learn the hard way yesterday, when I finally made it to The Bellvue and was told there were no more Happy Hours.   Despite the disappointment, I stayed. My friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant for about an hour, which was lovely. The servers were friendly and fun. We bantered, which is always enjoyable with a pint of beer. (The beers on tap are Guinness, Okanagan Spring Lager and Blanche de Chambly.)  There is a salumi and cheese menu (four salumis and four cheeses). Each kind of meat ranges from $3.50 to $4 per 60 mg. I picked the Speck and the Culatello. The meats were served on a long, wooden cheese board, with a few slices of perfectly pickled beets, baguette crisps and an assortment of roasted nuts. It was all topped off with a sprinkle of pines. It was very pretty. And man oh man, that meat was to die for. I really, really liked the Speck. If you like cured meats, you need to order this juniper-smoked, fatty meat. It was so soft in texture, it melted.   The service was great. The servers were all attentive and friendly (without being overly friendly).   My friend and I sat on the bar stools by the open windows, which was really nice. We could watch all the characters in the market go by.   I would go back to this place in the late afternoon for another pint."}
{"text":"Torontoians love brunch--even more, I think, than other Canadians, who still take the late-morning meal seriously, but have fewer restaurants dedicated to the art of Caesars, mimosas, and bennies. Within a dizzying array of options, the Bellevue holds it's own. Really on the 3/4 star cusp, everything was solidly good, but I can't help but hope it was all a touch...better.  On the corner of Nassau and Bellevue, the Bellevue is in the heart of Kensington Market, more a neighbourhood of coffee shops, hipsters, and fresh fruit and veg stands and a 'must-see' for first time visitors to Toronto. (Plenty of parking on the weekend along Nassau, or a short walk off transit from Bathurst).  Inside, the mood is hip, but not overly so. In fact, the Bellevue lacks any really interior design save a few prints on the wall and the creek of old floorboards under our feet. All the waitstaff were a touch too cool--waify boys with deep V-neck t-shirts, delicately coiffed hair, and big glasses. All fairly predicable for Toronto's brunch scene and our location close to the UofT. But service was a touch slow at the worst and chilly at best. Despite being the only table of diners in the restaurant, I felt forgotten about for moments at a time.  My friend and I both had the chorizo hash and americanos so I can't speak to the other menu options directly, but they looked similarly tasty in that egg-cheese-protein kind-of-way. The hash was topped with a poached egg--I love poached eggs and love nothing more than puncturing my poached egg to get that yolk running all over my plate. I poked. I poked again. No run. Both of our eggs were poached hard, robbing me of the fun of yellow yolk working through my hash. Had it just been one, I would have thought it was a mistake, but seeing my friend's the exact same way, it was clear this was their way of poaching eggs. Otherwise, the meal was quite nice. The chorizo cooked and seasoned perfectly. They also make their own hot sauce--if you ask for it--that isn't so much hot as it is sweet and tangy. A nice binding agent, especially in the absence of my precious yolk. All that said, the portion is actually moderate to small--we both scraped our plates clean--and didn't leave bursting."}
{"text":"I don't want to be too critical of this place - from what I gather, it is fairly new, and it's Kensington afterall, so I went in expecting things to be basic.  It started off well - when I asked the server how they prepared their iced coffee, he said \"You can have whatever you want - it's kind of like your own kitchen here. Just don't mess with the menu though.\"  Unfortunately things went downhill from there.  I ordered the El Especial, and my friend had the rainbow trout fillet.  My friend's fish was nice and light, and served with a green salad with avocado.  My breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, two flour totillas, and some black beans.  It was tasty, but really, it was just a typical diner breakfast of bacon and eggs, with tortillas instead of toast, and a side of beans added.  For $40 (yes, $40 for brunch and a coffee each - in Kensington), I expected more than to have to endure the entire meal in the heat, feeling the sweat work its way through my t-shirt, without even an offer of a water refill.  If you are going to have a restaurant without air conditioning, you need to do a little something extra to make your guests comfortable.  Also, regardless of the informal nature of your establishment, a quality check is essential.  We did not see our server from the time he dropped off our food to the time he came back with the bill."}
{"text":"Sometimes you finish a shift, or a nap, and you just need two mason jars of sangria, bbq'd maple sausage with caramelized apple, and one glimpse of the blonde woman who rides a tri-scooter. Take it! The city is yours!!  I've been frequenting Bellevue since I moved here and it can be a little wooden dreambox if you hit it at the right time. Everyone who works there is smart and good at what they're doing, and the food's great.  It is also standards-loweringly romantic if you're dating with any tragic flaws. Include the walk down Bellevue from College for the best willow tree going."}
{"text":"We walked into Bellevue somewhat by chance. It become immediately apparent to us that the new owners are trying to do something out of the ordinary with this place. They serve breakfast, brunch (on weekends), lunch and dinner. The menus are written on chalk board and seem to change quite a bit from day to day. If you are tight on time and drop in for food, you might be disappointed to learn about the 2 hour gap between 3pm and 5pm, when food is not served. If your timing is right, you will realize that the food is made with a great deal of care and attention to detail. Beer drinkers may be displeased with a lack of options. I do, however, highly recommend the cocktails, as they are absolutely divine. The French 75 really hits the spot on a hot summer day. The white sangria is served in a mason jar with ice and a berry medley. The food was modest in size but not lacking in flavour. The flat iron streak and shrimp seviche were incredibly succulent and tasty."}
{"text":"I've stumbled in and out of this place on numerous late night adventures.  It's always packed, and the music and crowd are always enjoyable.  I recently grabbed some to-go Americanos with a pal and the coffee really impressed me.  Looking forward to doing a food review soon--but that may not happen before my next blurry memory of the Bellevue at night, awwww yeah."}
{"text":"After reading on BlogTO that this was rated one of the best new brunch spots in Toronto, my girlfriend and I went into the market to check this place out.   We sat down at one of the stool spots inside and glanced the menu. We both had americano's which were pretty good, nothing special. I ordered the El Especiale which was more or less a huevos rancheros and my girlfriend ordered the omelette of the day which had rapini, mushrooms and a cheese (I can't remember right now) which looked pretty good but I did not have any. Upon food arrival, I noticed the black beans/tomatoes/guacamole all came together in a small bowl on my plate. I always hope that when a rancheros arrives that is a big soupy mess of beans and salsa. The meal was ok however the sausage that came with it was pretty top notch. 3 long and skinny pieces that were very fresh and tasty. These guys seem to do a good job of that.  All in all I would go back, however I would not hype this place up to be anything special."}
{"text":"Bellevue was nice, but when we went we had specific look-for's in mind, and although the vibe was nice, it didn't serve our needs.    For 2-3 ppl, it's fine, but I wouldn't recommend this place for a large group (6+ ppl).   It's not AC'd, which would be fine for most, uncomfortable to others.  The snazzy online menu looks nice (I like its Western font), but it's been outdated for months.  (Don't worry, though, fellow Yelpers, I've uploaded their current menu - just look through pics posted for them here on their Yelp page).  They have mostly vegetarian and omnivorous options for breakfast. They have a few vegan and possibly gluten free options as well.  ex: tofu steaks; watermelon gazpacho soup.  Prices are around $12 a plate.   Enjoyed: *the cool server w/ the trendy hairstyle.  He's the kind of server who looks like any Kensington Market patron...  Trendy Indie-type, nice friendly service.  *Food was nice, fresh.  *They seem to emphasize local ingredients as well: yay!  *Easily accessible by local transit, bike friendly (enough), and there are two green P city parking lots - one at Baldwin X Spadina; the other lot is on Bellevue past Nassau st.  (approx. across the street from the home at 27 Bellevue).  On the sucky side:  *Their path leading downstairs, ultimately to their narrow chintzy bathrooms, triggers my childhood visit to Ottawa's Museum of Science and Technology's Crooked \"Crazy\" Kitchen (ref: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPP_TQLXb3k). *Food was good, though not too much beside their surprisingly fresh lettuce, stood out enough.  (I also wish that they added more salad dressing, it was so faintly there).   I'd go again, sure, but there are so many eateries in K-Mkt.  Might be a while before, and if, I visit this place again."}
{"text":"I might be a sore thumb here, but I despise the place. Bad (no.. HORRIBLE) experience during my first visit was enough to make me want to avoid this place for the rest of my life.   We ordered the El Special and Steak & Eggs and our waiter told us that the S&E would take 20 mins to make. Not a problem, we told him to just bring in both orders at the time. An hour passed by and we still had not gotten our orders. We followed up w/ our waiter and he told us they would come out very soon. The table next to us came in 45 mins AFTER us and they got their orders FIRST within 15 mins after they ordered. Guess what? They also order the Steak & Eggs, which we had been waiting for AN HOUR. Our meals did come out just after theirs.   We were so pissed that we couldn't enjoy our meals at all. Will never ever EVER go back to this place."}
