{"text":"Generally, I have enjoyed my visits to the Free House Pub.

The bartenders know how to make a good drink there. Their Free House Pub Old Fashioned is well-balanced and strong. They have a great whiskey selection and good beer options.

They make a good sandwich here. Anything with turkey on it involves thick cut turkey breast that is moist and flavorful. They use cherrywood smoked bacon which is fabulous, and strong cheeses. The garlic Parmesan fries are so delicious! Crisp fries with shaved parm and a strong garlic flavor. A friend of mine swears by the sweet potato fries and another by the spicy Asian slaw.

The cheese curds we ordered were overcooked, with little cheese left inside the breading. Bummer.

Overall, good food, good service, great beverages.

They also have a very nice patio!"}
{"text":"Hovering between a 3 and 4 I think, wish I could do half or quarter stars. I really the garlic parmesan fries, the \"ole standby\" is a good, simple burger, and the drink list is pretty good, but the service can be a little inattentive and I think some of the prices are high. I would go a few times during the summer to linger on the patio, but there isn't really a \"wow\" factor to get me back on a consistent basis."}
{"text":"Went to this quaint place for homecoming in Madison and were charged an automatic 20% tip. The food was good, but the service (waitress) was rude an inattentive.  Middleton is worth a visit, but keep walking past this place. No one should EXPECT 20%.
Thank you Yelp for helping us keep everyone honest."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and I likely won't go back for a while. The food is really very good, but, the service is slow. The first time we went, it was around 1 pm on a Saturday. The patio was full so we were fine sitting inside. The bartender ended up serving us and she couldn't have been more annoyed or stressed out. She rushed us and never even smiled. After waiting about 15 minutes for our food, she told us the kitchen was backed up and it would be another 5-10 minutes. It ended up being another 15-20. They slightly messed up the order, but, overall the food was great! The second time I went we sat outside. Our server was so sweet, but, again seemed stressed. We waited at least 35 minutes for our food (party of 4 people) and when it came my order was wrong. I sent it back, waited another 5-10 minutes, and then got my food. It was delicious, again, but didn't feel worth it since we waited for so long. Our server did thank us for our patience when we left. A third time I went I just had drinks. It was fine, but, slow service, again. 

I think this place will be great when they figure out their staffing. I will go back again, but, I will give them some time to figure it out."}
{"text":"I really like the bar area the big windows and open atmosphere really create a great vibe for the space. The bar staff was very friendly and attentive. The beer selection was pretty good, as was the food. I had the buffalo chicken wrap; it was nothing to write home about but it was good nonetheless. My boyfriend had the Cajun chicken sandwich and the garlic Parmesan fries. His sandwich was really good and we both really liked the seasoning on the chicken. If I'm on that side of town I'll definitely go back to try some more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Won't be going back. 
Decent selection of beer and clean premises, but that's about where it ends. 
I had the ABLT and it came to the table without the avocado. We tried to flag down the server 3 times without results. There were only 2 other tables present. Finally got the Host's attention and got the avocado. I had to wait so long that my sandwich cooled significantly. the bread (grilled, not toasted) got soggy and oily, the bacon was too chewy, and there was nothing spectacular about the palette. The greens were ok, but also very oily. 
My husband had the portabello sandwich. the bun was as cold as if it had just come out of the fridge. It actually hurt his teeth to bite into the cold bun and then the very hot portabella. There was also nothing special about the flavor of his selection either. The bun would be better toasted at the very least
He had a Guinness which came in a can. It was an older beer. If you drink Guinness, you know it doesn't have a long shelf life in a can. 
We sat inside because of rain. The restaurant area was very warm, as in I was sweating. It's 60 degrees out today. It made it very uncomfortable to eat. 

I think this would be a good place to catch a few drinks or hit happy hour with some co-workers, but I'd skip eating here and head to one of the better restaurants in the area. 

They say they are locally sourced for food, but I'm not entirely sure what part is locally sourced and which isn't. While I applaud using local sourced and keeping small businesses going, making bland food doesn't do justice to the local suppliers."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here the food is very good, but they short pour every beer that is better than bud lite. It is the place to go to get a beer you can't find elsewhere, but if you can find said beer somewhere else my recommendation is to go to that place and get a full pour."}
{"text":"We went here on a recent mid-week night.  We got seated in the quieter side of the restaurant, which I was glad to see--compared to the entry/bar area, which was crowded, sounded like there was a live band, and had a football game on.  

The server was attentive and quick.  I was going to get a beer but their cocktails list was tailored to the British public house feel so I tried one and would do so again. One of us ordered the avocado salad and the other ordered a burger, and both of us were pleased enough to want to return.

I enjoyed coming here on a quieter weekday night.  Not sure what the weekend atmosphere is, but I have hopes to make this place a semi-regular outing."}
{"text":"I've only had the pleasure of experiencing the environment of this restaurant during evening hours. Casual ambient lighting and overall a very clean place to dine in with your loved ones.

Definitely recommend this place :D"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and overall we truly like it.  I enjoy handmade cocktails and my girlfriend enjoys the beers.  The service has been good almost every time we've been here but is the reason for 4 stars.  The food has been very consistent and well priced.  The Wednesday night fish fry is great, the burgers are better than average, my girlfriend likes the veggie burger option.  The fries are always properly crispy, which is something so many places seem to mess up.

We will continue to eat and drink here and hope they get a little more consistent with the service."}
{"text":"Living in Middleton, this place is almost too easy for nights when we just don't feel like cooking, so we've ended up here several times since moving back to town. Definitely a gem in Middleton! My sister was married in this building back when it was Forrestal's, and I am impressed with the way they have used the space, allowing for plenty of room for larger groups as well as some semi-private tables. 
Their house old fashioned is one of the best in town. The sandwiches on the menu are large and delicious, particularly the ABLT and pressed pesto. Splurge the extra $1.50 and upgrade to a side of the sweet potato fries, or better yet, the garlic parmesan fries!"}
{"text":"cool atmosphere, great drinks...will be back to try the food!"}
{"text":"Visited this place twice while in town on holiday. The food is excellent. The seared tuna was perfect, not over-cooked. Less one star because they were unable to process a credit card for me to purchase a gift-card without me being present."}
{"text":"I will never, never, never go back to this place again. The service was awful. The food was marginal and the waitress added a 20% tip to the bill for no reason.
I adjusted the tip to 15% on my debit card (still too high) and they still billed me the higher amount.
Stay away from this shit hole.
If you decide to go and get a waitress named Amy leave immediately."}
{"text":"Great beer (I had the Krombacher Piilsener) & great atmosphere.  Sitting at the bar and salivating over their whisky selection made me wish I could take a cab home! Haven't eaten there yet, but when I do, I suspect I might change my review to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie burger with side salad, overall unimpressive. The burger was tiny and completely dried out, tasted like something you would microwave at home. The salad was simple with a nice dressing but also very small. The atmosphere is nice and the staff pleasant but $9 for a slightly large slider veggie burger and tiny salad I left feeling cheated and hungry. Nothing special about this place, might be nice to grab some drinks but the food is typical pub fair done sub-par."}
{"text":"Stumbled in one night and can't wait to go back.  Hostess graciously offered to pull up a couple of extra stools to an already crowded bar so that we wouldn't have to wait.  Food was great (especially the smoked ketchup ... seriously, why have I never thought of smoked ketchup), beer was great and the whiskey selection was great.  Great great great."}
{"text":"Food is ok but love the atmosphere.  A nice addition to dt middleton."}
{"text":"We recently lunched at the Free House. First, amongst the best cheese curds in Madison area. Black bean soup had a nice 'zip' to it. Asian wrap was very good and rather unique. Very good local beers available. Only negative was BLT bread was fried (heavy in summer heat), but you may love it."}
{"text":"On a recent Friday night, after a ridiculously difficult week at work, I was in desperate need of a fish fry - walleye, please. So we decided on the Free House.

It was a gloomy evening, but not actually raining, so we took a table outside. The patio is lovely and the tables have umbrellas big enough that, if it had started sprinkling we wouldn't have gotten drenched.

I ordered a Templeton rye old-fashioned press - which was perfectly made. Bonus points, too, for having Templeton.

Free House offers a choice of grilled or fried walleye - I went with the fried and decided to upgrade (for $1.50) to parmesan garlic fries on the side. Wish I hadn't with the fries - I'm not sure what I expected, but the parmesan and garlic were just shaved over the top. Not even remotely melted, so they just fell off when you picked up a fry. Wasn't really thrilled to eat the cheese and garlic that I paid extra for separately with a fork. And they were served with some kind of dill aioli that both I and my dinner companion mistook for tartar sauce because of the dill. Let me posit that one thing that should NEVER appear in aioli is dill. Yuck.

The walleye...*sigh*. My favorite fish - but this was not my favorite way to have it prepared. Cornmeal? Really? Cornmeal is for catfish - not walleye. If you're going to do something unorthodox like that, please say it on the menu. The fish, itself, was slightly overcooked, but not ruinously so.

On the other hand, the cole slaw was excellent. Too bad there was so little of it on the plate.

Service was friendly and attentive. And again - that old-fashioned. Yum.

Maybe just drinks next time...

Update: So the management says they don't use cornmeal on the walleye. Huh. Well, it looked like cornmeal and chewed like cornmeal. Maybe it's those dried breadcrumbs you can buy in the grocery store. They have a similar look/tooth - and lack of flavor. I still think the method of prep (breaded or battered) should be on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I like to eat a low-carb diet as much as possible. We've both seen enormous benefits to our health and weight by doing so. Sometimes, it can be expensive to stick to our self-imposed guidelines when we're at a restaurant, because a lot of places like to short you on protein and veggies and pad the meal with cheap filler stuff like potatoes and bread. Not The Free House. 

There's tons of yummy salad options on the menu that come with homemade dressings. The jalapeno popper appetizer is not breaded or fried. Any sandwich or burger comes with fries, but greens can be substituted for no.extra.charge.

Plus, the food is DELICIOUS to boot, and the staff is friendly and fun. Even if you do not eat low-carb, there's still tons of other carby-yummy-goodness on the menu too. It's just nice to know of a restaurant where you can choose to eat healthy, or not. It's nice to have options.

In the summer, the patio is fun too!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place after deciding I wanted more of a local flavor than Subway sandwiches. My burger was great - it had a really homemade quality to it and was just the right size. The outdoor patio was lovely, not too crowded with a great mix of people. Spot on service as well. Really charming downtown too. I hope I organize my fellow Epic trainees to step away from the franchises and come this way. I'm glad I did and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was fine.. nothing to complain.  fried cheesecurds were delicious!!!  wait staff was great.  it was a fun atmosphere.  My burger was just, meh.  I coworker enjoyed his beer though."}
{"text":"No back story- just went out for dinner one night, so I'll get right to the review:

Nice-looking place with a nice patio.  We were seated promptly, but at a table towards the back of the room which was very lacking in light.  I suppose I should have asked for a different table near the windows but we'd just come from outside & I guess I thought that once our eyes adjusted it would be fine.  I ended up having to read the menu to my dad (he's in his mid-70's).  They also sat a few tables after us and it got quite loud- it seems the acoustics are not suitable for light conversation across the table.

Good, but not spectacular menu selections.  We opted for appetizers of cheese curds & jalapeno poppers.  Both were good but a tad over-priced for what you get.  Drink selection was very good (though I wish they had a straightforward IPA... they offered a double IPA, an oak-aged IPA, an APA, an American IPA... what gives?).  The kids menu is limited.  One gets the impression that they will serve kids but it's an afterthought.

I was happy with my prime rib sandwich- very tasty.  The side of parmesan fries could have been executed better... they were very garlicky and the parmesan was in wet clumps on top, rather than tossed throughout.  My dad got the walleye special and enjoyed it.  The kids got burgers which were cooked correctly (they hate when they are served hockey pucks).  My wife got a strawberry and mixed greens salad, which she was kind of disappointed with... I'm not really sure why but I think she expected a chopped salad.  She did say that candied walnuts were advertised but the walnuts she got in her salad were plain.  

In conclusion: we were not wowed by our visit to the Free House Pub, but we didn't hate it.  I think I'd definitely stop in again to sit in the patio and have a cocktail, if I happen to not have the kids with me. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection. Fair prices. Good old fashions. The food was way better than just normal bar food. I would give this place 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"The back bar (on the Parmenter Street side) is a WONDERFUL place for a quiet drink. The regular bar is expansive and if there is a big crowd in there it gets noisy and it echoes. But the back bar (or side bar, depending upon how you look at it) is a VERY nice cozy quiet place for a drink.

For whatever reason I'm most often in the Free House in the cooler months of the year. They have an excellent selection of single malt scotch whiskey and I usually try one of them (Scapa 14 and Talisker Storm being particular favorites of mine, also Laphroig) and a porter or stout on the side. 

Excellent selection of draft beer and single malt scotch. I have not yet experimented much with their bourbon selection."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything this restaurant doesn't have! From the friendly, totally knowledgeable wait staff, to the fantastic beer list to the cozy atmosphere, The Free House really hit the spot. The big surprise to me was the number of vegetarian and fish options. My group split the vegetarian nachos, which were GREAT but pretty rife with peppers, so beware! I went with the Ahi tuna sandwich and even without the wasabi mayo, it was still very moist and perfectly seared and very fresh. The menu also had lots of great sounding salads and sandwiches and burgers that included a variety of sides and local ingredients, like Madison Sourdough, Angelic and Colonial breads.  I also really appreciated the local beer selection and wound up trying something from Sand Creek Brewery, which I'd never heard of before. The waiter let us know where we could buy some to take home, so that was cool. Overall, the dark-wood paneled  bar area was the perfect place to have a winter lunch before venturing back out into the cold. It looks like there is outdoor dining in the summer, judging by the size of the patio."}
{"text":"Fairly salty regular pub food. Decent but uninspired. Due to the heavy salt content I doubt we will be back often, but it's not a bad place to grab a meal if you are in downtown Middleton."}
{"text":"Their portobello mushroom burger is amazing! We used to go there all the time after football games, and they are always very friendly, even though they get super busy in a small location. Love it!"}
{"text":"When you're having such a great meal that, before you know it, you've ordered drinks, an appetizer, dinner, AND dessert, you know you've found a good spot! Ya know sometimes you're feeling a little frugal and order water to drink and choose between an app OR dessert, or forgo both!. With the amazing meal we had at the Free House, I can't imagine skipping one course next time we return! 
I ordered the Free House old fashioned to start- the Yahara Bay cherry brandy makes it quite delicious and quite strong! Loved the jalapeno poppers for our appetizer-made with fresh, unbreaded jalapenos, so don't touch your eyes after eating! 
The oven roasted turkey sandwich was mouthwatering, and I think I'll have to make it my go-to order on all future visits! The dessert special that night was pumpkin cheesecake. Homemade and OHSOGOOD! 

Really looking forward to returning after this miserable winter is over, and enjoying a meal on the outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Our first visit was great. The place was clean and nice looking and everything we ate and drank was really good. They have a really nice outdoor patio area we enjoyed. Our server was also very nice. I highly recommend trying it."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes when I went in because of the great reviews and the cute patio. We opted to eat inside because outside was packed. It was really cute and felt like home. 
No one was really friendly there. The hostess barely spoke to us and a few servers nearly ran us over. Our server was nice enough, but not super attentive. It was obvious that they were understaffed, as I saw a few bartenders indoors running food outdoors.
That aside, our food was also just mediocre and it took quite some time. Both my fiancé and I ordered burgers, and we waited over 45 minutes for them. We were in the restaurant over an hour a half having diet Pepsis and burgers. No one apologized to us for the wait, but the couple at the table behind us had their meal comped. We aren't big complainers while at restaurants, but we probably should have spoken up tonight, and we didn't. At the same time, I completely understand what it's like to work when you're understaffed and the kitchen is too busy. It sucks. I just wish someone would have told us something, but no one said anything to us. Really, they took our order, and gave us our food. That was it!
Needless to say, we will probably never go back to the Free House."}
{"text":"Very very good. Locally sourced food, tasty local brews. Happened to stop in for lunch during Madison craft beer week (as they were promoting East side breweries vs West side, and glad to have been able to sample this 'civil war'). As it was a colder dreary spring Saturday, sat inside (but also had a cool outdoor seating area). Great vibe overall that works well - historic building in the cute hamlet of Middleton, married architecturally with a clean more modern long bar. Great friendly (and knowledgeable) service too...nothing not to like here. Lots of locals, And if I lived here I would frequent often too. Nice establishment!"}
{"text":"Free House is located around a growing restaurant cluster around Parmenter St in Middleton in the old Forrestal's Gallery.  The building is historic and has been home to many former businesses - the building dates to the 1800s. 

Free House's beer, cocktail, and separate whiskey menu are extensive.  This explains the crowded bar area in the entryway around happy hour on my visit.  The food attempts to match other local upscale bar food (The Great Dane, The Laurel Tavern, Coopers Tavern).  Granted, the crowds I've seen here are mainly divided into the bar group and families with children in the dining area and neither are likely going to demand fussy hipster ingredients.  Chicken fingers, a standard burger, and grilled cheese are all available.  The restaurant does have sweet potato fries, parmesean fries, and a homemade vegetarian chili, though, so it's not exactly a country dive bar, either.

As a vegetarian, I appreciated the availability of a veggie burger made in-house.  I had mine with a side of greens.  It was fairly good, though needed some sort of additional moisture from sauce or veggies.  My friend's \"Big Tex\" burger was loaded with sauce and needed to be cut in half to avoid a BBQ fashion emergency.  The goat cheese beet salad and fish fry special (on a Wednesday night, no less) at the neighboring table looked like good bets for next time.

Service is quick and prices are reasonable.  The decor is probably a work in progress but I'm guessing with time they'll bring the current \"rec room chic\" up a level or two."}
{"text":"The Free House has a nice outdoor patio area in the summer,  and the best seats indoors are the bar stools by the window. The rest is dark and dated, but the food often makes up for it. Today I had the walleye po'boy; the fish was grilled to perfection, not too spicy, and served with hot, freshly made fries. Another favorite is the avocado salad, with garbanzo beans,  cherry tomatoes and kalamata olives, with drizzled balsamic vinegar; add grilled chicken, because it's delicious. Today's salad was served with a piece of bread that was day-old at best; two days old is more likely--the kind even a squirel or pigeon would not eat, and the kind no one with a hint of self respect should ever serve to humans.  If you're a drinker, there's a vast selection of great beer and an impressive list of underpriced Scotch.  I was drinking diet Pepsi and had to get up and go get my own refill (when I have a beer, someone asks if I want another faster than a Porsche can hit 0-60).  As Einstein said, god is in the details (and we should listen; he was a pretty smart guy).  However, the management IS paying attention, and the Free House, more often than not, is a place where the food and service are both solid."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends for dinner and some drinks. Since it was so nice out we decided to sit outside on the patio, which was pretty spacious and luckily had a lot of seating. Unfortunately I never saw the inside of the place, but from what I could see it looked pretty nice! 

They have a great beer selection, with a lot of great choices on tap. I ordered a burger and it was cooked exactly the way I had asked. The parmesan fries on the side were really good, although the pieces of parmesan were cut too big. Normally I would prefer this for a salad or on pasta or something, but for a finger food it made eating the fries somewhat difficult to eat as the parmesan didn't adhere to them. My friend mentioned that they would be amazing with some truffle oil, which I thought was a great suggestion. Overall a pretty cool place with a decent menu! We will probably be back!"}
{"text":"The beer selection was good.  We waited a long time for our food and the waitress did come back to fill the chips and salsa we ordered.  The food was not awesome just ok.  I expected more from the raves I heard about this place.  The service was sooooo slow for a week night."}
{"text":"Here last Fri night. Cool building. We ate in the bar area next to the spiral staircase. Service was great. We had the fish and a burger. Food was ok not great. First thing I noticed when we were seated is the area was kind of musty smelling but it is an old building. Also had a couple of the blueberry cocktails which were really good."}
{"text":"Really cute place. Went there after work for dinner and had a great cocktail and delicious tilapia tacos. Great outdoor patio for this summer weather. Will definitely come back when I'm back in the Middleton area."}
{"text":"I would give this 10+ rating, if I couid.  FABULOUS fish fry!  One of the best that we've ever had.  This is going to be a regular Friday night fish fry for us, from now on.  Grilled cod, with mixed greens, cole slaw and an awesome dipping sauce for the cod.  Awesome!  AND the best part, healthy!!   We had Deanna and she was wonderful! Very nice, extremely efficient. Our meals were perfect!  Everyone else is nice there, too.  Cozy, very comfortable atmosphere and not too noisy, so it was easy to visit with our friends.  A \"Must Go To\" restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Garlic Parmesan fries are delicious. Good drink selection. Service is average but friendly. 
We will be back."}
{"text":"The best Fine Whiskey list in all of the madison area, gotta specifically ask for the list tho, off the chain!"}
{"text":"What a cute place! My friends and I were looking for a new place to try for dinner and drinks and happened to stumble upon The Free House Pub. I'm so glad we did! Great service, food and drinks. Not to mention the incredible outdoor seating area. 

First, the ambiance. The outdoor patio is amazing. Plenty of seating without feeling too cramped, and as a bonus there was a guy playing a wooden flute/guitar all night. The space is also super cool - a renovated old, old house. The combination is awesome! 

Now, the food. Between the three of us we tried the Black Bean and Edamame salad, ABLT, and Honey ham and sharp cheddar sandwich. Each entrée received raving reviews. The only complaint heard throughout the night was that the dressing on the salad may have been a little too salty but that was it. 

The drink menu is huge. They have a wide variety of beers to choose from, and serve just about any local beer you could think of. I tried the Free House Old Fashioned and really enjoyed it!

Service was great too, super fast and friendly. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Edit: I actually increased my rating. I have been going here off and on for the last two years and I think their food has improved. Beer and beverage selection is still great. 

Once you get past the attractiveness of the outdoor patio this place is really kind of meh. They have a good import selection and good drink selection but the food is often bland and unimpressive. I feel like they are overpriced for the quality of their food. Menu is pretty simple and doesn't change often."}
{"text":"Went to Free House for drinks on my birthday and my mom and I ordered 2 glasses of Rose.  The server was quick to our table and very attentive, and the Rose was delicious.  The reason I rate this place at 5 stars is that the size of the pour was very large- I don't pour my glasses of Rose at home as full as they poured ours today.  Very impressed!  And the server was very kind and genuine.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Three strikes and I'm afraid you're out. I won't be dining here again after tonight. The first time I ate here (a little less than a year ago) and got poor service I thought it was a fluke. The food wasn't great either but the atmosphere was excellent so I wrote it off. The second time I ate here (this summer) the service was mediocre at best and the food was worse than the first time. We also got seated in a huge room with no windows and where there wasn't a single other diner in sight despite it being the middle of the day. Lots of time had passed between my first two visits so it wasn't as though I had been anticipating a bad experience or anything. Months later, tonight, I visited The Free House a third time. This time the appetizers, main dish, and service were pretty unremarkable. The lettuce rolls were not rolls at all -- the plate consisted of an ice cream sized scoop of filling that resembled something akin to pink dog food and a dozen or so puny scraps of lettuce. I guess we were meant to assemble the rolls ourselves. My dinner mates (a strapping teenager accustomed to eating just about anything and a grown man with a healthy appetite after working all afternoon on a farm) exhibited no interest in that dish and ultimately we sent that plate back. The waitress expressed no disappointment, nor did she offer to bring out anything different. To her credit the appetizer did not appear on our bill but one can only wonder how routine that may be given that it produced no reaction whatsoever from our server. After we were served our fish tacos and asked how the first few bites were, our waitress again had no reaction (not one word, in fact) when I expressed my disappointment. The fish tacos (which both my partner and I ordered) consisted of little more than reheated, mushy, breaded fish strips with an excessive amount of thousand island dressing zigzagged across the top. Blech. I was able to get one of the three down despite not having had lunch today. In sum, while this restaurant exhibits some lovely exposed brick, wood panelling, a couple of nice bar areas, and a pleasant semi-covered outdoor eating area, the food and service certainly leave much to be desired."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming. I had the mushroom Swiss burger and paid $2 extra for gluten-free bread that fell completely apart immediately. They sat us in a back room with no atmosphere, which seemed to be where they put people with kids. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Love it! Exactly the way I would want the bar in my house! Super friendly staff too :)"}
{"text":"Definitely dig The Free House Pub ! 5 stars 
Cajun chicken sandwich was delicious. Pineapple and Malibu was on point. And the fries are good enough to eat without ketchup. I'll be dropping in again soon!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Friday night fish (fried version) is really, really good! Just ask Darcy, Dan, Ann or Ian.  Sweet potato fries excel. Vast selection of brews on tap, too."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but only ever just for after-work drinks and appetizers. We decided to try dinner just last night. Things started off fine. The overall ambiance, noise level, and lighting levels (nicely dimmed) were fine at the bar. The selection of beers on tap were interesting. Things went downhill from there, though. I waited five minutes to get someone to put my name on a table list. Someone did ask early on if I was wanting a drink from the bar and I said no, we want a table. I guess that wasn't their job because then they just ignored me. We finally got a table and opened the menus. The variety of food offered seemed very standard and uninspired - nothing really jumped out as saying \"try me\". That's a personal preference though so I won't dwell too much on that. We settled on the fried cod since there was nothing else that looked interesting to us. It took a long time to come and when it did arrive the fries were soggy and cold. The three blocks of fried fish looked like they might be Sysco frozen fish sticks. Tearing into them didn't change my opinion.The breading seemed like a dense, hard, tough over-seasoned shell protecting water-logged flavorless cod. My friend and I barely finished it all. We both agreed that this was probably the worst fish fry we've ever had in Wisconsin. I will still come back for after work drinks and maybe appetizers but I will not be coming back for dinner unless I hear that they make some serious changes in their kitchen."}
{"text":"This is an incredible whiskey bar. They allegedly have good food... but that's not why I come.

If you're seeking allocated whiskeys, chances are The Free House Pub has a few. The selection of whiskeys changes as new ones come in and old ones go out. When you step up to the bar, be sure to ask for a whiskey menu. There are things that your eyes won't find. At the same time, look around. Sometimes there are things available that haven't hit the whiskey menu yet.

When you're looking at the menu, check out the prices. You won't find any Miami, Chicago, New York or Las Vegas pricing here. You'll get excellent pours at very affordable prices.

If you're into Angel's Envy, they even have their own private bottling of it.

Finally, the staff is very friendly. I know my whiskey. Sometimes the bartenders do, too. Regardless, I've never run into anyone there who wasn't a pleasure to deal with and won't take a few moments to chat with you, especially during slower times.

The Free House Pub can get very crowded. All I'll say is patience is a virtue that will pay off.

My only recommendation would be for the food menu to be more gluten-free friendly. I'd love to sample some of the food. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is nice and busy without the overbearing crowded feeling. There was a back up in the kitchen and I had to wait longer than expected for dinner. There is a nice outdoor area, but the menus is limited for the outdoor area. I had the shrimp tacos and the shrimp were seasoned well and the flavor was noticed. The garlic fries were ok, but you may skip them and choose another option."}
{"text":"As far as American fair this place rocks! The food is great. I highly recommend the Avocado BLT with parmesan cheese frys! The have a great area with couches and tv for easy lounging while eating and drinking."}
{"text":"We traveled up North for the day, National Mustard Day in Middleton....decided to have lunch and was pleasantly surprised at The Free House Pub. We had pretty good service, would like to have had water refill on a more regular basis since it was pretty hot out and we sat on the patio.  But, on the whole the service was friendly and prompt with food..Had the Black Bean & Edamame Salad which was light, refreshing and a great lunch.  My husband had the Black & Blue burger and said it was one of the best he's had..Our son ate quesadilla's and like them...big and cheesy!  Great beer and wine selections and if your a whiskey drinker...you'll be in heaven!  Will definitely  visit again!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first experience at the Free House Pub and am looking forward to a second visit. 

To start, the atmosphere is charmingly quaint. The building and patio are old stone with vines inching across the exterior. A guitarist and wooden flute player sat on the outdoor patio and entertained guests with lively irish music. All of this really made for a low-key, rustic- almost old world- feel to the place. The patio was busy for a Monday night, I don't think there were any empty tables after we sat down, though it wasn't loud and it didn't feel cramped. I was inside briefly, as we ate on the patio. The interior had a warm and inviting feel- dark walls, dark wood, dimmed lights with pub style tables. 

The food was very good, as far as pub-fare goes. I ordered the Black Bean and Edamame salad. The ingredients tasted extremely fresh and the dressing was light and flavorful. My two friends ordered the ABLT, and the Honey Ham and Sharp Cheddar Sandwich. Both were impressed with their sandwiches. Both were made on quality breads with artisan cheeses, and had large portions. 

The cocktails were average. I had an old fashioned and it was nothing special.  They have a long drink menu with a wide-range of beers, and a few wines. Next time I will probably stick to their beer menu. 

I will definitely come back for a casual, inexpensive dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Great place to eat outdoors in Middleton. I have never had a server here who wasn't very sweet and helpful - always good. The beer selection is awesome - try the Duchesse sour if available. The food is perfect for \"what it us\" - you won't break new ground for originality but what you'll get could scarcely be improved on. The sweet potato fries are CRUNCHY - when was the last time you had really crunchy SP fries?? I eat plant-based or vegan, and I got the salad with chickpeas, and added the portobello which tasted like a marinated steak. I save five stars for meals that blow my mind... But my whole family loves this place (kid's meals are huge, btw) and I'll be back time and again!"}
{"text":"I was in Wisconsin for training for the week and this place was close to my hotel.  Also, they had fried cheese curds on the menu which I HAD to try!  I had been hearing about these things for weeks from my coworkers who have already been out there. It was a Friday evening and the place was pretty packed. The atmosphere was typical suburban bar. Not too rowdy, but loud. I'm not a beer drinker, but the Pinot Noir was good! :o)

We had to wait a few minutes before our waiter came. The fried cheese curds were good! They tasted like fried mozzarella sticks to me, but still pretty good. My coworker got a burger and I got a deluxe grilled cheese sandwich that we shared. Both were really tasty and filling. She decided to try the clam chowder and it wasn't that great. I may be a little biased, but I don't buy seafood in the Midwest. Unless it's deep fried in beer batter and served with fries. The specialty is meat and cheese. Seafood, I'm sticking to the east coast. I decided to try the sweet potatoes fries which were very good. 

Overall I liked this place. It was walking distance from our hotel, the people were friendly and the food was good. It was a nice place to have a laid back and chill meal after a long week."}
{"text":"I'm very fond of the Free House, and as a local, I will return to it often. The atmosphere is excellent. A great chalkboard mounted to the exposed brick wall over the bar lists all the current (and all-Wisconsin, and all awesome) craft beer listings. Every one of their signature cocktails contains locally distilled spirits - try their Free House Old Fashioned, made with Yahara Bay cherry brandy. Yum!

As you might have figured, the focus at this place is on the local bounty. From the Clasen's hamburger buns to the locally sourced beef, not much will show up in your glass or on your plate that's not from nearby. And of course, it's all delicious. 

The Free House has two owners, and each of the 10+ times I've been there, both owners are around. I'm pretty sure they don't sleep - one manages front of house, the other works in the kitchen. I'm sure their constant presence contributes to the quality of the place.

On the whole, the staff is A+. They have some extremely talented bartenders who always remember everything about me, to the extent that I'm a little alarmed. In general the servers are competent, although I've had one or two slightly unpleasant experiences with frazzled servers on busy nights. And this is one of the very few downfalls I've discovered about this place - it does get very busy. If it's a Friday or Saturday night, or if there's music on the (beautiful) patio, expect the Free House to be noisy and crowded.

On the whole, I highly recommend the Free House. My favorite way to enjoy this establishment is to sit at the bar with a microbrew and split some delicious grub with a friend. The bar has the best atmosphere and the most talented staff, and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I really liked the garlic parmesan fries...I substituted the regular fries for those.  I thought I'd still get the small amount with my wrap and salad, however, I didn't get the salad and got a larger than expected amount of fries.  I took them home to my dog which he loved!  The Hawaiian Barbeque Chicken Wrap was tasty.  I returned 3 days later and had the buffalo chicken salad, again...tasty!  I may come here more and more often if I can afford it.  A portion of the sandwiches are about 9, but the average plate here is about $12 for lunch."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, nice concise menu, excellent outdoor patio. Definitely get the garlic parmesan fries!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:45, but the place was already packed. Since I was dining solo I decided to forego a wait and eat at the bar. 

Arrival: It took a little longer than I would have expected with 3 people behind the bar to get someone's attention, but finall I I asked the bartender for a drink list and he handed me a beer list. No biggie. Asked a different bartender if there was a drink/whiskey list and got the right menu this time. 

Drinks: There are a number of interesting cocktails using locally distilled liquors. Theres also a fantastic selection of Scotch whiskeys arranged by region of origin, including Oban 14, one of my favorites. At $9.50 it's just a smidge more than I would expect to pay at a place like this. Unfortunately the price wasn't the only issue. First, they served me a fine single malt scotch in a highball glass. Second, for $9.50 I would expect at least a 2 finger pour, this was barely more than 1 finger in a narrow highball glass. I'm thinking it was probably a 1 shot pour at best. I don't think I'll be ordering another straight whiskey here anytime soon. Stick with the cocktails.

Food: Food took about 15 minutes from order to service. Pretty impressive considering how busy they were. I ordered the Big Texan Burger  which is local beef on a local bun with bbq sauce, fried onions, and cream cheese. The patty was tasty and well seasoned but I ordered medium and this was cooked past that closer to the well side of medium well. The patty itself was a little small and got lost under the rest of the toppings. Speaking of the toppings, the BBQ sauce is spicy..like. quite a bit hotter than I would have expected, that must be why they put the cream cheese on it. Still, everything together didn't quite work. The patty which clearly was tasty was overpowered by everything else, and by the time I was done I was still craving a BURGER. I ordered the Garlic Parmesan fries and unfortunately we ran into another problem with the bartender not listening to what I said. When my order came it had sweet potato fries. Had another bartender check the order, sure enough, he put in sweet potato fries. Considering I had a conversation with my fellow barmates on which fries I should order, we were certain it was not a mistake on my part. I kept the sweet potato fries since I want to eventually try both. The fries themselves were crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and had just the right amount of sweet. Serving size was again a little small considering I paid a dollar extra for them. All in all, the food was high quality, but not quite what I asked for and may not have quite been to my taste, but I can't hold my preferences against them.

The thing that really turned the visit around for me was some time talking with Tim , the owner. He asked how everything was, and when I said there were a couple of issues he was totally responsive. Right down to coming by with the bottle of Oban later in my visit and pouring me another serving in apology for the previous short pour. I confirmed with the owner that they are doing a 1.5oz pour. So $9.50 gets you 1 shot. Tim also talked with me about some future plans for the place including a possible expansion out front that will be a whiskey and wine patio. According to him, he wants to be the preeminent whiskey/scotch bar in the Madison area. Considering the place is only 6 blocks from my house, I highly approve. 

All in all I can't complain. They're busy, they just opened, and the food is clearly of a high quality. I'm excited to come back again a few times over the coming months and see if they're able to smooth out the bumps."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I's favorite place to take people who are visiting in town. The drink selection is huge (especially if you like whiskey) and the beer selection is pretty darn good as well. The only reason this doesn't have a 5 star rating is because the wait staff could use some serious work.

We walked in on a Friday evening, prepared to wait for a table. They offered us one right away, but after sitting down it was far too close to the door and was very drafty. They let us know that the seating was \"first come first serve\" so we walked into the next area and sat down, thinking it would be no biggie since it's \"first come first serve\". Well, a few minutes later a waiter comes by with a group of people, and asks us if we checked in at the front. We said yes, but then he told us that we would have to move because this wasn't our table.

Come to find out, it isn't \"first come first serve\" after all! It was a little embarassing, and wasn't handled very well by the staff. Our waitress at our next table was also not very knowledgable about the beer list. I asked for \"a wheat draft beer\" and she brought me a bottle. It was a good beer, but not what I had wanted.

Even with all of that, their pretzel appetizer is to die for. If I could sleep on a pile of those fluffy pretzel breadsticks, I'd be the happiest girl alive."}
{"text":"The Free House Pub was a nice, casual dining spot. The menu contains classic Wisconsin staples such as cheese curds, a prime rib sandwich and a Friday Fish Fry. Our food was solid and good. We started with cheese curds, which were average. We split the short rib stuffed grilled cheese, thinking this sounded unique. The sandwich was good, not nearly as heavy as it sounded, but I think it is accurate to say we would have preferred it to be a little heartier. It was a little skimpy on the meat. We chose the Asian slaw as our side, which was actually excellent. I recommend it. We tried the clam chowder (it was cold out), and despite low expectations (I realize ordering clam chowder in Wisconsin is a gamble), it was really good! It wasn't too potato-y, and there were a lot of clams. 

So, food got three stars. We weren't drinking, but I have a feeling if we had been the Free House would have gotten 4 stars. For a Friday in Middleton the bar crowd was lively, and the place has a great beer and whiskey list. I think I will return for the full experience. 

One nice note-bar and dining is very separate, so the Free House can provide a great kid/family environment, as well as a nice place to grab a beer with friends without feeling like you're surrounded by kids."}
{"text":"Just got back from a fun night out with some friends there.  We just went for drinks.  We wanted to sit outside on the patio, but it was too cold out, so we went inside.  The bar was great - plenty of people inside, but not too noisy - in fact, the vibe was calm, and my friends and I could hear our conversation.  Mixed drinks were good and the bartender was super nice!"}
{"text":"When our friends suggested this place for dinner, my first impression before coming here was \"oh great, bar food.\" I wasn't completely wrong in that aspect, but I was definitely surprised at the quality of the food and service.

Four of us shared the fried cheese curds appetizer with ranch and honey mustard. Not too salty. Not too bad. I kept the ranch for my fries.

I ordered the California Burger. If finishing it in less than 5 minutes doesn't tell you how good it was, then I don't know what will. I requested the meat to be cooked medium, but it came out more medium-rare. I didn't bother returning it since I noticed the temp half way through the burger. French fries were seasoned well and not bland. Not soggy either, which is always a plus. 

My fiancee loved her Free House Bleu Cheeseburger. She raved about the garlic aioli sauce it came with and dipped the life out of that burger in that thing. She also loved the garlic parmesan fries. It wasn't just seasoned with garlic parmesan--it had huge shavings of parmesan cheese with a nice kick of garlic in the mix. She was a happy gal. 

Service was great. Our server always checked on us at appropriate times and split our bill as evenly as he could, even though it really wouldn't have mattered if a couple dollars went here or there. A for effort, though! The music that accompanied the evening reminded me of being a village with hobbits. It was entertaining, nonetheless, and actually fit with the ambience of the restaurant.

I take it back when I first said \"oh great, bar food.\" Definitely exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"My second visit I had the BLT - although I swapped out the bacon for a piece of cheese. It was excellent...a much better sandwich than the one I had on my first visit!"}
{"text":"I had a very negative experience here a few weeks ago. I actually created a Yelp account just to review this bad experience. We sat as a group of 3 on the front patio. Our waitress came to our table twice in a relatively short time - for drink orders and then food orders. As soon as we placed our food orders, we did not hear from her again for FIFTY MINUTES. Yes, it took 50 minutes to get us two cold sandwiches and a burger. And during that time, we did not hear from our waitress once. In fact, we didn't even see her outside during that 50 minute wait, so we couldn't have even flagged her down to refill our drinks or ask for a status on our food order. My friend finally got up and asked the man at the host stand (middle aged guy, potentially a manager?) why we hadn't heard from our waitress in 45 minutes. He was completely unapologetic about it and just said, \"Yeah, she's pretty busy tonight.\" When she finally brought out our food, we were offered no apology or explanation for why it took so long. Not even a \"Sorry for the wait.\" Based on her lack of caring, as well as the guy at the host stand's, it is pretty clear that this restaurant has extremely low service standards."}
{"text":"I particularly enjoy the Sazerac, and anything with Shrub-although the Ginger is my favorite flavor."}
{"text":"I live and work close by so I've been to this place many times.  They have a lot of taps but really only a decent selection.  The best beers at at the smaller bar to the right of the larger one.  The outdoor are on Parmenter is really a better place to hang out than the packed-too-tight patio.  These Food Fight restaurants are starting to wear thin as far as food goes.  It is all decent to good, but nothing special, but I think that is part of formula.  It is fairly boisterous and meant for the after work crowd. The worst thing is the service.  They just can't seem to hire many personable people.  Even at the bar, it just doesn't feel right.  They have huge TVs but don't try to be a sports bar, they have lots of taps, but charge premium for less than premium.  They have good food but not that great.  It's like they took their idea from the Hilldale or Verona Great Dane, but don't make their own beer.  So don't seek this place out, but meet your work buddies there then find a decent place to eat, and a more friendly place to knock back a few."}
{"text":"First visit for a quick lunch.  We arrived at 11:40 am and were seated promptly in a quieter back room.  Menus and water came quickly. My burger and wife's Mediterranean salad, did too!  Both were solid and would enjoy again.  (The Tipsy Burger from the Tipsy Cow is still my fave though!). Their menu is not huge but seems to have something for everyone, all with a little more upscale twist.  Just right!

They have a nice interior in darker woods and nice outdoor patio seating.  We will definitely return to dine AND enjoy their outdoor seating and nice selection of tap and craft beers.  I know it'll be fun.

Good food and solid service at fair prices in a nice environment.  Yaay!  Love it.  We're fans.  I believe we just found a good reliable spot.  See you there.  Until then, Yelp on!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorites in Madison! The atmosphere in here is super unique, and you can feel like you're in different spaces depending on where you sit. Very neat way to utilize a historic space. They have an expansive selection behind the bar and I totally dig the (very large) chalk board beer list! A wide variety of beer for all tastes. I've always loved the food here. The turkey sandwich is second-to-none, and it takes so much will power to try something different on the menu because it is just that good (although whenever I try something new I'm never disappointed!). They often have dessert cheesecakes and those too are second-to-none. In the nice weather months the patio outdoors is a great place to enjoy a cold beverage. Last time my dad was in town he said he was in the mood for a turkey sandwich (GO FIGURE!) so we drove well across Madison to go here - he said it was well worth it. The Free House is also totally wheelchair accessible (to include bathroom!). Highly recommend to all!"}
{"text":"Sigh my love for one too many English novels might influence this review. I could picture stopping by this inn on a snowy day getting down from a carriage and warming myself with hot food and ale at this pub. 
It was reminiscent of an old English pub. 
We were seated immediately. The service was good.
I ordered the free house old fashioned - it was delicious. I am no expert on Old Fashioned's.. in fact, this was my first taste of this cocktail and I really liked it. 
We got jalapeño poppers and chips salsa and guacamole for apps. The jalapeño poppers were hot and fresh out of the oven. Loved that it was not breaded.. has a slight kick to it. The chips salsa and guacamole in hindsight may not be a good choice at a pub. It was ok. Chips were too thick/hard, salsa was good but guacamole was alright. 
We split a pesto sandwich with fries. The sandwich was very good. I loved the bread it was made on. The fries were also crispy and hot (just from the fryer). 
The total bill for 2 drinks, 2 apps and 1 entree was $35. WHAT?!? 
Oh and if you are a whiskey connoisseur they have an entire page dedicated to different types of whiskeys that they carry."}
{"text":"I love the tap selection here. The food was ok... It almost seems pre-prepared... I like the unique architecture/ floor plan of the place. I think I might give it another try this summer when things warm up. Service could be a little better, there was not one smile on the Sunday afternoon that I was visiting."}
{"text":"Was delicious.  Hubby and I were treated to a kidless night out.  Sat out on the patio at the Free House and enjoyed a couple of burgers and a few manhattans.  The menu is very simple...nothing crazy and not many choices.  Perhaps I was surprised about the simple menu at first, but on further consideration....the choices were good, and the place isn't trying to be snooty and weird.  Just good bar food in a great atmosphere.  Very relaxing, service was wonderful...great ambiance.  Can't wait to head back!"}
{"text":"I have heard so many things about the Free House Pub and I thought...hmmm, it is about time I tried it.  And?  No regrets!

I ordered their prime rib sandwich with harvati cheese.  This is honestly the BEST beef sandwich I have had in Madison.  (Technically they are in Middleton, but this  sandwich made up for the distance.)  The harvati cheese provided a nice flavor pop to the sandwich.  The bread was also well chosen.  It was on a soft roll, not too chewy.  My big complaint?  The au jus.  It was SO salty.  It was pretty much inedible.  Luckily, the sandwich did not need the extra moisture.  

I upgraded for $1.50 to the garlic parmesan fries.  They were delicious!  The fries were crisp, hot and nicely seasoned.  They came covered with fresh parmesan flakes.  Absolutely delicious.  The aioli that came with the fries was good.  Not great.  It was creamy and a little sweet.  The fries stood alone but it would have been nice to have something with a more savory flavor.

I paired my lunch with a beer from Ale Asylum Hefeweizen.  The beer and cocktail menu was pretty expansive.  I wish I had tried a house cocktail rather than the beer.  It was just ok.  

I definitely plan on going back soon.  We ate on the patio, which is gorgeous and nicely covered.  Whether you want something shady or sunny, you can find it."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times with the boyfriend for dinner and drinks. I really like this place! I've sat both on the patio and in one of the back rooms inside. Next time I'd love to sit at the bar.

Overall, I have no complaints about the Free House. The food is good, the beer and wine selection is vast, and the servers are nice. One of our friends is a cook here, so we try to head out here as often as we can. I've had the Friday fish fry (yum) as well as a few sandwiches. I would recommend the grilled cheese. It's delicious and the bread is perfectly toasted. A great app is the Garlic Parmesan fries. They have a lemon dill aoili sauce and it is oh so good.

This would be a great place to come in the summertime. I've had the best experiences on the patio. It's very quaint, and it's fun to sit outside, drink a giant glass of wine, and dine of yummy food. The atmosphere is quite casual, so it'd be a great place for after-work drinks."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Great curds. But slightly sterile vibe. We came for happy hour and encountered a somewhat uptight after work crowd. The music was really lame. overall this is a good spot to grab a brew, but wouldn't go out of our way for it."}
{"text":"Really like this place. The hubbs and I like to go here as well as our daughter. Lots of locals like To go there. Local food Decent place. Friday is a bit bananas. What isn't crazy busy on a Friday night though"}
{"text":"Four of us came here on June 3rd for fish on a Friday night.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table outside.  What a nice area to eat outside!  We had the jalapeño poppers for an appetizer.  Delicious!  They were not fried, but grilled!  What a nice change from the usual fried appetizer.  We also split the fried cod and an order of grilled cod.  Both were equally good.  The fried had a light breading and was not greasy at all.  The grilled had a good seasoning on it and was not dry.  The french fries were the best I've had in quite a while, and didn't even upgrade to garlic fries!"}
{"text":"Twas Sunday night and we met a couple of friends for dinner and drinks at FHP on a recommendation.  Our experience left much to be desired. Everyone had something to complain about.  

They had a beer list which included a couple of beers that weren't available.  No big deal, it happens.  The waiter took our food order while half of our drink order had not yet been served.  We thought OK, well he's definitely not an experienced server, let's cut him some slack.  He told us the soup of the day was Beer Cheese Brat. The soup he delivered had carrots and chicken.  We asked if there were supposed to be chicken and carrots in the Beer Cheese Brat soup. He said it was definitely Beer Cheese soup.  When the bill came he later apologized and said that it was in fact Chicken Pot Pie. 

Besides the crappy careless service, the food was incredibly meh.  We ordered the smothered fries as an app.  It was fries with cheese and a few crumbles of bacon.  Extremely underwhelming for a $10 appetizer. My girlfriend's Ahi Tuna sandwhich was gross.  They forewarned us that the tuna was cooked rare.  Totally cool, thanks for the heads up.  The sandwich was served less than lukewarm.  Gross.  It was served on a dry flakey bun.  It was disgusting.  I had the Hawaiian BBQ wrap.  All you could taste was the vinegar slaw which made up over half of the over priced, under portioned wrap.  My friend loved his buffalo chicken salad. 

Everyone agreed that the place was overpriced and definitely didn't deliver. If it was located anywhere besides a rich suburb it would fail miserably.  I gave it 2 stars because of a decent beer selection.  None of us will be going back."}
{"text":"The parmesean garlic fries are SO GOOD. My friends and I devoured them. Real slices of parmesean on top and a great dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Ahi tuna sandwich was very good, and gluten free bread was a nice option. Great drink selection and bar area was nice with patio option."}
{"text":"Food was good  fresh and tasty. Quality ingredients and friendly waitstaff. Meal and value were as expected. Definitely will return when Im in the area."}
{"text":"Long wait for food to arrive. Terrible chicken roll up. Too much really Hot sauce made it inedible.  Wife's Cesar salad was in her opinion very good. The coleslaw was tasty and good. If it wasn't for the terrible rollup I would give it a better review. The service was pleasant but very slow so I didn't get to return the rollup and replace it with something else. I guess you could say we were underwhelmed with the experience today"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for a quick beer so a sit down dinner. There are about 40 beers on tap and local beers abound.
The Cajun chicken sandwich was delicious. I love the jalapeño poppers.  You will not go wrong here."}
{"text":"The food was bad. There was three of us so we got appetizers. It's hard to imagine messing up soft pretzels, French fries and cheese curds, but they did it. The cheese curds were the best of the three. The pretzels weren't really pretzels. They were like little loaves of bread. The French fries were covered in thick, unmelted cheese. It was not a good meal. The service staff were rude or ignored us. Not a good time."}
{"text":"Outside dining on a fall night = delight with Raspberry Mule. ABLT & Pulled pork served us well. Family friendly & healthy drink options."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, great atmosphere... perfect.  It's a pleasant surprise in a area with dumpy bars like the Hody and Village Green.  Friday fish fry has the BEST fish I've ever had in this area (grilled or battered)."}
{"text":"Food was great, the patio was fantastic. I ordered the avocado salad. Ingredients were fresh and chicken on top was a nice combo.  My fiancé ordered a Bloody Mary (which was delightfully spicy) and the buffalo chicken wrap which was also good. Service was friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food loved the vibe! I little nosey at the bar but what bar isn't loud! A must go to in Middleton!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Madison! Where every restaurant loves Gluten Free people. Sometimes I feel sub-human since many restaurants don't have a lot of options for a Gluten Free person like me. Trust me, I'm not GF by choice.

This place had GF beer to start - always a win in my book. Then we had the spicy deviled eggs which were a hit with the majority of our party. There were a lot of delicious options on the menu but I went with a Avocado BLT on GF bread which hit the spot. Unfortunately, their fries were not GF but I had a lovely side salad instead.

The Free House Pub also has two peaceful outdoor seating areas for the beautiful summers months in Madison. If you live in Middleton, make yourself a frequent visitor here!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying the Free House Pub and was disappointed.

The positives:  a very attractive interior, well lite with several large screen TVs.  The bar has a large selection of beers and full alcohol service.

The negatives:  slow and inconsistent service.  When you walked in the sign said to wait to be seated and a young man, standing over near the bar kind of just stares at you for a minute before you realize he is the host and you need to speak to him (because he was not approaching us).  We got our menu quickly (we sat at a high top in the bar) but the waitress never came back.  Luckily a bartender noticed the lack of service and came over for our drink order (and food because we had read the menu about 5 times).  The food was not to our liking.  The chicken tenders were food service quality and something I would expect at a dive bar at 1 am.  The roasted turkey sandwich was not turkey roasted on site like the menu indicated, but process turkey slices.

I see no reason to go back.  I can get a less expensive beer at many places.  I know where to get the best burger in Middleton.  PJ Alders has much much better tenders.  And I rate largely on service and honestly, both of which were substandard here."}
{"text":"The special costs twice as much as anything, and it's not so special. Good service. Nice outdoor space. Just don't order the special."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, drinks were well made, price is average for Madison bar I think. We would go back."}
{"text":"Had my first visit at Free House a couple of weeks ago and just now have time to write a review. First lets talk about about the ambiance, very spacious, live music (not a band, but a fiddler and banjo type) which in my book was great, tons of big screens, and low lighting which i enjoy for a casual dinner. We had a party of 3 and opted to sit at the bar, we came just to check it out, grab a couple drinks and maybe some apps. For my first round i got a whiskey sour, nothing to be impressed about but wasn't terrible either, the other 2 got beers they've never had, they liked them. 2nd round i got a chocolate stout, which i throughly enjoyed. Now onto food, we got the sweet potato fries with smoked ketchup, im not a huge ketchup fan to begin with but even i liked it! We also got the parm fries with lemon aoli sauce VERY GOOD sauce, the fries were cooked perfectly also, not soggie or too crunchy. I wanted to try something different so i ordered us the deviled eggs, because how often do you see that on a menu?? I really liked them, i mean it's hard to mess up a deviled egg but all the extras they put on it were great, fresh cooked bacon, sirracha, and chives! I would totally recommend them. The reason why im only giving a 4 is, the bartender (also our server) was kind of a crab, wasn't friendly, didn't care to give us recommendations, through our food and menus down, didn't come to check on us, seemed to be only focused on a couple of women at the opposite end of the bar, but hey we all have those days i guess. We'll probably come back for an actual meal but would probably sit at a table next time."}
{"text":"Had a good dinner tonight at Free house pub.  Very Gluten friendly restaurant.  We got the jalapeno poppers which are chargrilled and mu daughter enjoyed the cheese curds.  I got the ABLT on gluten free bread and my wife had the grilled walleye poboy both with fresh greens on the side.  We had free house old fashioned drinks which were excellent.  Enjoyed the meal and the irish music was just kicking up as we left."}
{"text":"I just ate here this week while attending a training conference. The atmosphere was quieter than I expected but it was a Monday night. The interior was clean. The staff was courteous and seated us quickly.

I was told to try cheese curds while I was in the region. For those not from the area it is basically fried cheese served with a dipping sauce. The ones here were tasty. I also had a burger. It was perfectly cooked, good sized, and the cheese on it was flavorful. The price for the appetizer and entree was about $20 which was quite reasonable for the quantity and quality.

The beer selection was also quite good. I will be eating here again when I have another trip in a couple weeks."}
{"text":"We came here on one of the first decent nights this spring to enjoy the patio, cocktails, and food and we were not disappointed! Cozy cute atmosphere in downtown Middleton with great service. Decent beer selection, and a full menu of different types of whiskey. I had the grilled cheese which was delicious and my husband had the roasted turkey sandwich. Updating to the garlic parmesan fries is a good choice, but they could use some truffle oil. Prices are reasonable, the only thing that could make it better is some heating lamps on the patio for when after the sun goes down!"}
{"text":"It's difficult for me to review this place 3 stars, but our food was extraordinarily slow coming out of the kitchen. Also, the cheese curd appetizers weren't fresh and didn't \"squeak\"- we actually suspected they might have just fried up pieces of mozzarella!

With the negatives out of the way, our portabella mushroom burger and bleu burger was pretty tasty! Also, our waitress was a nice and bubbly college aged girl who was fantastic. I didn't have any of the beer, but they were all reasonably priced at $4.50 and feature many local brews!"}
{"text":"Was staying one night in Middleton and needed a great spot for Sunday night dinner and located this gem here.  Housed in a historic building in old town Middleton, they serve a great selection of pub food -sandwiches, burgers and wraps along with a variety of local brews and cocktails.

It was a mild night so we sat on the secluded outdoor patio starting with barrel-aged Old Fashioned cocktails (among the best I've ever tasted) and some cheese curds (arrived super fast, even beat the drinks to the table!), very fresh and hot.

For dinner I chose the roasted turkey sandwich with cheese and bacon while others in the group had the walleye po'boy (a bit spicy) and the pulled pork sandwich (tangy and sweet).  All the food was top notch and arrived very quickly (they weren't super busy).

Service was good and I'd definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"This is one of those \"tweeners.\" i'd like to rate this about 3 1/2 stars. it's a decent pub with decent food and decent atmosphere, but I cant give it much higher praise than that.

The Free House sits in a beautiful area full of shops and restaurants, and it looks like it would be great to sit out on their patio on a summer's eve. Alas, it was 40 degrees last evening, so we were inside. The building was evidently originally a residence or lodging, and is thus comprised of many separate rooms and coves; it's very homey in feel. What it is *not* is quiet. The sound seems to reverberate off everything, and it's not easy to hold a conversation. The decor and furnishings are nothing memorable, mostly dark wood and plain walls.

One of the good features of TFH is their tap beer selection, which contains many local microbreweries. Prices are decent, around $5 for a pint. The bar was crowded on a Friday night, and it looked like a fun place to sample some local wares.

As - I guess - befits a pub, the menu is limited to basically sandwiches and hamburgers. I had the battered cod sandwich, which was very good. Mi esposa enjoyed her battered cod fillets as well. The \"Old Standby\" cheeseburger was ordered by my son, and was exactly that, and my daughter had the buffalo chicken wrap, which she found to be quite buffalo-ey - that is to say, spicy. The french fries were not extraordinary, but were certainly good. All in all, a solid, if unspectacular, meal.

Our server was attentive, and my kids received refills on their drinks before they even knew they were a quart low. Overall, a fine experience, but not one that I'd go to extraordinary lengths in which to partake."}
{"text":"We only had drinks here so I will have to update if/when we have a meal. Stopped in on a friday night around 6:30 and the place was crowded. From what we could initially see, all of the seats at the bar were taken. 

The hostess pointed out a second bar in the back of the restaurant, and let us know that if we could not find a seat there, we could order our drinks and take them up a small winding staircase to another seating area. 

Hooray for the seating area! It is a cozy little loft with a few tables and chairs. Either people did not realize it was there or patrons having food were seated downstairs (with good reason, the staircase is narrow,) but the space was ALL OURS. 

I ordered the \"Barrel Aged Old Fashioned\" and was unimpressed when the flavor of the brandy conquered all other flavors in the drink."}
{"text":"Really good, awesome draft selection, amazing bourbon and single malt list. I had the patty melt and shoestring sweet potato fries with smokey chipotle ketchup and the wife had the turkey Sammy with regular fries. Our waiter suggested a perfect pairing of a German Pilsner with my wife's Sammy.  Excellent food! Great service!"}
{"text":"I went to The Free House on a date after my dad mentioned a good review he'd seen in a local newspaper.

I loved the building right away. It must be in an old house or something, because the tables are located in what looks like a former dining or living room. We had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated (it was a Friday or Saturday night), so we sat at the bar for a little while first. I had a Wisco 75 cocktail. I thought it was great--very fruity and light. My boyfriend had a glass of Glenmorangie whiskey, a favorite of his.

Once we were seated, it took several minutes for our server to arrive, which was a bit annoying. She was very polite and nice, though. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken wrap, and his only complaint was that it could have been a bit spicier (but he has a high tolerance for spicy food; my taste buds are crazy-weak, and I thought the wrap was plenty spicy). I had the salmon sandwich, and it was delicious. The salmon (an actually manageable size, which seems rare for a salmon sandwich) was fully cooked but not overdone, the lettuce and tomato were fresh, the lemon dill sauce was delicious, and the bun really held up well.

Overall, I loved The Free House, and I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Food is ok, not great, although it's really hard to screw up a sandwich.  Serving sizes seem small, with an over abundance of bread.  Outdoor tables during the nice weather are nice."}
{"text":"I love Free House. I've been 20+ times. It is located near my home and work.

My all-time favorite thing on the menu is their buffalo chicken salad. They are friendly and open to changes from the listed menu descriptions: (no crouton/no bacon, etc.) 

Their fish special is also worth the visit. I love their baked cod.

A must-visit if you're in Middleton!"}
{"text":"Well, I was in town visiting and saw this place highly rated with a nice food and beer menu. I was a little less than impressed by the service. I waited 10 minutes for my beer. Fine. I understand that it's busy. But then, after the waiter brought my beer, I immediately ordered my food...a buffalo chicken wrap and the garlic parm fries everyone raved about. I wasn't asked if I wanted a refill on my beer and no one checked on me or gave me an update of my order in the 40 minutes I waited for my food. When I got my food, my fries, which I paid extra for, were cold. I informed the waiter who promptly brought out hot fries which I really appreciated. 

All in all, I give this place a solid 4 stars for food and beer but deduct a star for the slow service. A well run kitchen, even with freshly prepared food, doesn't have a 40 minute wait for bar food."}
{"text":"We ate out on the patio. The atmosphere and food was wonderful. Friendly service. Large beer menu. Afterwards we walked around the quaint neighborhood. A great place for date night away from the kids. We'll visit again!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Free House perhaps a couple of dozen times. My experience has been that they were novel and really pretty good early on, but have settled into ho hum west side mediocrity. 

The food is pretty bland and some of the options at on the spendy side... $15 for a fish po' boy? I had the avocado salad and added chicken tonight. Decent portion of chicken... But it was more a green salad with a half sliced avocado. There were some garbanzo beans as well... but they seemed more a garnish than anything else. 

I've had the last iteration of the the fish sandwich... Not the current $15 version. I was put off at the extra charge for an a request for additional tarter sauce... 

My Mom had the prime rib sandwich... We often it rare... It came out a loud medium to medium well. It was pretty bland - albeit good for my Mom. 

I really want to like this joint... But the service is spotty and the food is just sorta OK. I will way the beer selection is robust, they do serve
late and are open on Sunday evenings."}
{"text":"I love the free house.  I have never had a bad meal here. Great staff, great atmosphere.  They have great knowledge of fine whiskey."}
{"text":"I'm bummed. I like The Free House. I do. But today we had lunch and well...I was...bummed. Maybe it's a rest-on-laurels thing. And they could have every right. They usually get terrific reviews. But my experience today was less than terrific. 

I had the Buffalo Chicken salad. Let me say this; it's huge. Super huge. But for all of its huge-ness, the quality was not so huge. The greens were decent and mostly fresh. But wow. The chicken seemed like an afterthought of left-overs. Diced and very dry. Jerky dry. The croutons (I think the menu refers to them as homemade..not sure though) were actually rancid tasting. The chunks of blue cheese and tiny diced red onions almost made up for it. And there was enough dressing served on the side in two separate dishes, which was nice because the chicken was so dry. Normally I'm not a dressing kind of person but this time, it was welcomed. The slice of bread on the side looked ok but I didn't eat it.

My guy had a Cobb salad and said it was great. He also says braunschweiger and limburger on rye is great, too. Which it is. So he's probably telling the truth. 

I don't know... I guess all in all it wasn't awful. Just not good. I'll wait for the patio to re-open and stick with my glass o' vino and appetizers."}
{"text":"Downtown Middleton is such a cool little town! If you are def check out this brew pub. The outside sitting is so cozy and it was accompanied by live music. Def load up on the appetizers they are all really good. Highly recommend the deviled eggs and the cheese curds! The sand whiches were all right! There is a lot of good food here for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is an awesome little craft brew location, on the trolley route. They have excellent fresh food, and an amazing collection of craft brews, with lots of local selections. I had the bacon lettuce tomato with avocado, with Parmesan fries. I also had cheese curds, which are unlike anything I've had before! All of the elements on the BLT were fresh and very high-quality. I will be back later this week and on future visits.
UPDATE: back again months later. Still great! French dip was outstanding. I also tried the salmon sandwich on a prior visit, very good as well."}
{"text":"I probably would have given this restaurant 2 1/2 stars if I could have, but didn't think it deserved a 3 star rating.  The term \"meh\" definitely applies here - nothing exciting with the food, drinks, service or atmosphere.  The homemade chips, guac and salsa were all bland and the portion size was very small.  My sandwich and my dining companions' burgers were very bland.  Oh, and don't order the sweet potato fries.

If you're looking for a burger/sandwich/fry place you can find much better in Madison, or even Middleton!"}
{"text":"The food was good, I was there with 4 co-workers we sat on the patio which was very nice.  The waitress was cold and barely did her job.  It ruins a meal when you feel like you are inconveniencing the waitress to get more water.  Disappointing, it's amazing how poor service can ruin your opinion of a place.

I went back again to see if it was a random situation last time.  We walked in and tried to figure out who to ask for a table., a waitress told us where to stand- we stood there ignored (it was 4:00 on a Friday) for ten minutes while waitresses chatted behind the bar.  Until I went up and asked who was going to seat us they ignored us.  Again it was a bizarre experience.   Too many good restaurants to bother to try again."}
{"text":"This place serves up top notch bar food. Definitely deserving of four stars. The service however was mediocre at best. I took my parents for dinner and we sat at the bar for a good twenty minutes before someone offered us a menu. My dad isn't the most patient person in the world so we went out of our way to put our order in. That being said the food was very good. I started out with the vegetarian chili. Absolutely delicious. Lots of Flavor, lots of heat. Just enough to make your forehead sweat. For my meal I had the can chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. Very good sandwich, not dry, with plenty of spice. My parents had the turkey sandwich which was even better. The turkey wasn't processed it was freshly carved and the bread was toasted perfectly. Had the service been a little better I would have been at 4 stars all day long."}
{"text":"Great food, great selection of beer, great atmosphere and great outdoor seating. One of my favorites in the Madison area!"}
{"text":"Very nice outdoor seating for our first time eating here! Tried to come on a Friday night and it was too busy with an hour wait. Great whiskey selection. Get the Parmesan fries!!!"}
{"text":"I come here for the fish tacos every few months, which would be more frequent but I don't live super close by.  Always amazing.  The service can be a little slow (even when not busy), but the consistency of the food makes it worth it.  My husband always tries new things and keeps coming back with me.  Parking can be a pain but again, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"A perfect stop for a vegan before (or after) the Mustard Museum.  Best menu in the vicinity.  I enjoyed an icy cold black IPA beer from the long list of regional offerings, a bountiful & delicious salad w/ plenty of avocados & chick peas, and we shared a heaping basket of sweet potato fries with smoky ketchup for the table.  Who could ask for more? The menu also offers veggie chili, a portobello burger, and a veggie burger."}
{"text":"Really cool, laid back vibe. Nice diverse collection of customers. Good food (prime rib sandwich; cheese curds); great selection of beer and liquors. Friendly, efficient service."}
{"text":"Great place to come with the family. The poppers are excellent and the free house Manhattan project is awesome !"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!  A great eatery for lunch or dinner or drinks after work.  They have an excellent bar with a wide range of beers, wines and scotch and whiskey.  It is located in a historic building in downtown Middleton and it is a major step up from the grease spoon bars located in the area.  The bar area is set up to open up 8 doors to their out door seating area.

Their food ranges from custom apps, to sandwiches, to fresh local beef burgers to custom salads (greens are available as a substitution for fry's at no charge).  I would imagine their menu will grow over time.

I'm for sure hooked on the Free House Pub!"}
{"text":"In town for a business trip and went here on the recommendation of a business associate. Wow! What a great meal!! I got there around 6:45pm on a Thursday ... and it took a little time to get a seat. Bar was packed with people! Great selection of beers on tap. I enjoyed a couple different local flavors. I got the Old Standby with the Parmesan Garlic fries on the side. The burger was tremendous and the fries were simply out of this world! Absolutely worth the buck fifty upgrade. The food was tremendous and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Great service, fantastic burgers and sandwiches, fun music choices, and great atmosphere - couldn't ask for a better choice for both food and drinks. The menu stays up-to-date and the staff are both friendly and knowledgable. In the summer months, the patio is the place to be.

The service is usually quick and friendly. It's not a long nor difficult table wait as there's often room in the bar (you can also eat in there easily enough). The beer and whiskey selection is especially pleasing."}
{"text":"This is a classy and cozy pub atmosphere. There are several rooms of different sizes that helps create the ambience. Having smaller spaces helps with overall noise levels too, making this a good choice for a romantic night out. I liked the eclectic beer selection as well as the extensive list of wines and spirits. Being from out of state, I had to go with walleye for dinner, and the Po' Boy sandwich didn't disappoint. A large grilled fillet with Cajun seasoning was topped with slaw and Sriracha aeoli. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food here was great!  I had the ABLT sandwich with fries and a side of cheese curds.  The grilled sourdough bread for the sandwich was super tasty.  This place offers indoor and outdoor seating.  I'd definitely recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Downtown Middleton is a charming small town and an equally charming restaurant. We came after the lunch rush and had our choice of seating.
It was a perfect day to eat outside. Days like this make me rethink living in California or moving to Madison.
The service was spot on and we quickly ordered our food and drinks. We started with the fried cheese curds. Need to start a blog to taste all the fried cheese curds in Wisconsin. These were yummy and gone quickly. They were more chewy then I thought it would be.
I had the buffalo chicken salad... it was quite the heaping pile of greens sprinkled with the buffalo chicken. I felt obliged to dump both ramekins of dressing on my salad but should only used one.
I don't know that the iced tea was fresh brewed ... it tasted a little bit like a powder tea.
But overall, a gorgeous day to be eating outside at the Free House."}
{"text":"Visited for an early weeknight dinner. Long-ish beer list with local and international options. Average food (tried nachos, burger, BLT, and a salad). Okay service. The patio and ability to linger for awhile to laugh and talk was the highlight of the dinner."}
{"text":"Food made this 4 stars. It was nearly 3. Free house struggles with a Very Congested entryway. They allow bar patrons to effectively block any access to the place. It was hard to get on the list because we couldn't get to the hostess stand.

But FOOD.
It's good. It's got a zing of specialness. Not Mind blowing spectacular but Plenty of new tastes to explore.
1. Spicy deviled bacon eggs- I will just make them this way forever now
2. Sweet potato fries- YES. Crispy texture. Finally. If you like sweet potato fries try these."}
{"text":"First impression was good.  The place looks nice and the addition to the building was nicely done.

We stopped for a late lunch.  We ordered a bloody mary and asked for water as well.  We had to remind the waitress twice to bring the water and we were halfway through our meal when it finally arrived.  Not a big deal.

We didn't want a large meal so ordered appetizers.  The Chips and Salsa were mediocre at best.  The guacamole was definitely not home made---more of the variety that comes in the squeeze tube from Sam's Club.  The menu said the chips were home made.  I'm not saying they were lying, but the tri-colored chips sure seemed like any garden variety you could get at Sam's, Costco or any other grocery store.

The cheese quesadilla was better, although the guacamole once again was free of any evidence that it was made on site.  

The drinks were good.  

What disappointed me were two things, one of which will guarantee that a return trip to this restaurant will be delayed until they work out the new restaurant kinks.

First, I went to the mens room.  As the restaurant had been newly renovated, I was surprised to find a smelly, hot and humid mens room that had obviously not been recently cleaned.  They definitely did not renovate the restroom from it's original incarnation when it was the Gallery.  It is a hot and humid Wisconsin day and there are no air conditioning vents in the restroom.  Instead a window is propped open.  It was a smelly, disgusting, hot and humid room.  A few hundred dollars more to what was obviously a costly renovation and they could have freshened it up and run an AC line into the restroom.

Frankly, I wish I wouldn't have gone to the restroom before I ate since it dampened my appetite significantly.

The worst thing though, is something I witnessed after we had paid our bill and were getting ready to leave.  We were seated in the bar area and one of the waiters approached the bar and placed an order for drinks for two women who were seated outside.  One of them ordered a draft beer.   

When the bartender pours the beer, the glass overflowed.  She then picked up the glass with all five finger wrapped around the top of the glass.  This alone is disgusting, unhygienic and goes against all of the basics of germ control.  What happened next was the topper, though.   As I said the beer overflowed on rim and side of the glass.  In front of the waiter and with any customer within eyesight able to see she took the BAR RAG and wiped off the glass and the rim of the glass.  

The potential for cross contamination from the bar rag to the rim of the glass (and the customers lips) creates the possibility for incredible pathogen transmission.  While I am sure this was unintentional, it is nonetheless unconscionable and is reason enough for the health department to intervene with severe sanctions.

As we left, I saw the waiter delivering the tainted glass of beer to an unsuspecting customer.  I couldn't walk by without saying something, so I told the customer what I witnessed.  I hope she demanded a replacement and/or decided to walk down the street to another restaurant.

I hope they get their act together.  It's a good location and has potential.  However, with what I witnessed today and with the disgusting restroom experience, I predict that this recent addition to Middleton's sparse dining scene will be short lived."}
{"text":"Beer selection is always top notch. Food is never a miss. Wife and I got married in that same building years and years ago so this place has a special meaning to us so ... We go often. They also run/own the Hawks Landing Tap Room and we split up our dining out between these 2 places. Both equally phenomenal."}
{"text":"Serious options for a place to sit and serious beer choices make it a solid pick... once I want to eat at and update soon!"}
{"text":"The most horrible service ever.  Ordered a pint of beer, charged for a pint of beer, and got a 12oz serving.  The waitress argued with me told me I was wrong as the 12oz glass sat next to another pint.  We still stayed and ordered food....only to be asked later to leave by a different waitress at 4pm because the patio was only for people that ordered food....  Great place if you want trashy cheap service from crabby waitresses who expect a tip just for breathing..."}
{"text":"Ordered my burger medium rare, it came with a thin browned outside and cold pink throughout. Medium rare should be a cool - not cold pink center (the middle 50% should be red/pink - this was 95%). 

The food was otherwise good, the service was polite enough but .... weird. The reaction to showing her the burger, before taking a bite of it, was \"no, that IS medium rare, next time order medium well.\" 
Um, no it isn't, would \"rare\" be just raw meat then, because you couldn't actually cook this any less - and no, there won't be a next time. 
That's just one example, there were other misses that made my whole party just wonder. Just odd."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time yesterday. We were walking around the area and decided to stop in for a beer. All we tried was the beer, so I can't really comment on anything else they serve.

Since the weather was nice, we asked to sit outside, and they very kindly let us do so. Normally, they only let people ordering food sit at the tables outside, but there were quite a few free tables. The service was attentive and very nice. The ambiance was really relaxing and laid back, which I liked a lot. They have an impressive selection of beers on tap, and we were both happy with our beers.

Overall, a nice place to stop by for a beer or drink. I'd love to come back with friends."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick lunch. There is free street parking available. Had no trouble finding a spot at lunchtime on a weekday. We were seated promptly. Service was friendly and quick. The menu is very standard fare with sandwiches, salads, etc. the standout item was the sweet potato fries. The Cobb salad was good but not great. Solid draft list. Very impressive whisky list. The patio seemed nice but we sat inside. Seems to be a very nice place to enjoy a drink and some good food. The area is cute with several restaurants and shops."}
{"text":"Not sure why anyone would knock this place. I went on a Wednesday around 2:00 pm and the place didn't have much going on but that was to be expected. The hostess/waitress welcomed us right away with a smile and friendly attitude. I used to live in Middleton and the first thought that went through my mind was that I wish this place had existed when I lived here. The decor is quite nice and the restaurant is spacious and clean. However, it should be noted that the restaurant seems to be comprised of two separate buildings that were later conjoined with the bar in the middle, which does give it an awkward albeit unique feel.

Anyway, we ordered the jalapeño poppers which we both thought were very spicy but very tasty. They were grilled instead of fried so the jalapeños were fresh and the accompanying dipping sauce was a great compliment to take a little edge off the peppers heat. I had the BBQ burger which had a mound of sliced jalapeños and cheddar on a Colonial bun. I loved it! My GF had the ABLT which according to her was \"super good\". She got it with the sweet potato fries which she thought were \"awesome\" and I'd have to agree with her on that. Also the sweet potato fries came with a side of chipotle ketchup and again it was spicy but very good. The theme here was SPICY and it's one of the reasons why we liked it so much.

I will be going back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Solid watering hole. Friendly and attentive staff. Local and regional distilleries well represented on the menu. Outside seating to boot. A welcome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"What can I say about one of my Top 5 bars in Madison?

The food is first and foremost amazing. I have ate almost everything on the menu and have only a couple times had something I didn't think was stellar and delicious. I recommend this place to all my friends and they all have such good experiences here. I personally reccomend the Quesadillas, fish tacos, and ABLT.

They have 2 patios; one for just drinks and the other for drinks and dining. Both are relaxing and pleasant to sit in. The place is large and can accommodate large parties at a short notice even. They have 2 bars but the 2nd one is usually only open on weekend nights.

They have a constantly changing quality beer list as well as a great selections of whiskey (whisky). 

The staff cares about good food and good service so I would recommend making a trip here even if you are on the East side of town!"}
{"text":"I recently went to the Free House with two friends.  We decided to go there because it was a beautiful early summer day and we wanted to sit outside.  Their patio is amazing and I will definitely be back.

There was a short wait to be seated (which is expected on a Saturday night) and we made ourselves comfortable by the back bar.  There's an awesome little spiral staircase leading up to a secluded and quiet small seating area, so we happily enjoyed their AMAZING selection of German beer up there while we were waiting for our table.

We were sat quicker than we anticipated and were very happy with the menu and the service.  Like others have commented, their fare is the hip Wisconsin bend on American dining similar to what you'd expect at Cooper's or the Great Dane.

We got the garlic parmesan fries for an appetizer.  YUM!  I enjoyed the turkey sandwich and my friends both had burgers.  Our only complaint is that they both requested their burgers to be medium rare and they both were cooked on the \"well\" side of \"medium well\".

After dinner, we continued to enjoy the patio and their large selection of excellent beers and cocktails. One of my friends offered me a sip of their old fashioned and it was perfect.  And, when we got our bill, we were all pleasantly surprised  as to how little we had spent.  The price point was definitely below what you'd find at a similar establishment downtown Madison.

Definitely check this place out, especially if you want some great outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"It's your typical bar food but done really well! The drink selection is great too. 

I'm trying to eat healthy but sometimes you want a burger, they'll actually let you get a wheat bun and a salad on a delicious burger. Of course there's the unhealthy option too. 

Service is good, they have great outdoor for the summer time. 

I've been numerous times and will gladly be back."}
{"text":"I've been curious about the Free House for a couple of years now because I pass its outside table area almost every day and see scads of happy patrons eating there. I finally got my chance this past weekend when the wife and I took our neighbor out for burgers and decided to give the Free House a try. We got seated immediately on a busy Saturday evening and were lucky enough to nab an outside table on what may have been the best day of the summer so far (temps in the 70s, not a cloud in the sky, etc.). All three of us were hankering for a burger and we all three got their \"Old Standby,\" a basic burger with cheddar cheese and a side of fries. The burger was excellent and the fries traditional and very good. The service was a little on the slow side, which I'll chalk up to a busy Saturday night with immaculate weather. All in all it was a great experience. It scratched our burger itch and left us curious to come back soon and try some of the other items on the menu. Definitely worth a look if you're in the area and hungry!"}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday when the weather was nice. We took a patio seat and the place was really nice. They served solid beers including my favorite Kolsch.

Fish tacos were OK. I wish they had a little more spice. Buffalo wrap was OK. I wish it had more spice. The pretzel appetizer was fantastic.

The service was awful. No smiles, no personality, she only checked on us once."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and had the avocado BLT with garlic Parmesan fries. The sandwich was mediocre. There wasn't much bacon and it really lacked seasoning. It was a very average sandwich. The fries were good and you get a lot of them. The garlic aioli was a nice dipping sauce for the fries. 

The decor is very nice. They have a cool outdoor seating area too. The staff was very friendly and the service was prompt."}
{"text":"I've been giving this place a try every 6 months since I attended it's soft opening. I want it to succeed. It's a great location, but the food is bland, drinks pricey, and service in the bar area poor. Example: ordered two imported tap beers, watched the foamy heads disappear as they sat behind the bar for 11 min. My friend finally reached over and grabbed them. That got the bartender's attention. If you go here, I recommend getting a table with a dedicated waitress. You \"might\" get decent service."}
{"text":"Positives:  The bacon & blue burger with fresh greens and grainy bun for 50 cents more was very tasty;   the beer selection is thoughtful;  the situation and decor is pleasant-breezy-suburban plus aspiring;  the staff are smart, hard-working, sharp people.

Negatives:  Beer prices are kind of high;  the Gulden Draak was great but the Capital Maibock reeked of buttery/skanky uncleaned line - - no way will I go back for a casual and overpriced brew under dubious quality control;  ueber-commercial and pretentious feel to the operation, for better or worse;   you are likely paying for slickness, cool, or posture, not for essential quality (though the kitchen product was very solid)."}
{"text":"Fantastic fish fry! Yum! We had the grilled cod, clam chowder and the deviled eggs. Service was quick and the old fashioned was yummy. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"What an adorable set up this place has! Great menu with plenty of meat free options too!  Was just here for lunch with some coworkers and their meals looked just as tasty as mine. Could be a little less over zealous on the soft drinks though. I had taken maybe three sips and they brought me a second glass, so by the end of our meal the table was cluttered with untouched drinks, but I will definitely be coming here after work one day to try some of those beautiful bottles behind the bar!"}
{"text":"Been here several times since my first review so I figure it time to update. We still almost always enjoy their bar service. I think we've sat outside twice. We really enjoy their deviled eggs with siracha and bacon. We tried the cheese curds today and they were really tasty, very lightly breaded. The ranch they came with was really delicious. I would steer clear of their jalapeño poppers. They were insanely spicy and inedible. And my husband and I love spicy food. I've made jalapeño popper before and they should be seeded and/or deveined more. Service is always really good, very friendly and they check on you often. My husband really enjoys their large beer selection. He can always find something new he can try. I also like how they change up their cocktail menu and the drinks are usually good and well made. We will keep come back here for drink's and good bar food."}
{"text":"Found this place thru Yelp while traveling to Wisconsin Dells from St Augustine, FL. It did not disappoint, from the incredibly tasty walleye Po'boy to the garlic parm fries to the fantastic beer menu. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was alright. We got the pretzle appetizer, with spicy mustard. I ordered the blt with avacado and my husband ordered the beer cheese burger. Everything was fine, but not out of this world. I would go here again but if it didn't impress me the second time around I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal! This is one of my new favorite places outside of Madison. I wish the Friday night fresh fish fry was every night. Everything was reasonably priced and the atmosphere is one to be desired for by couples. The wait time was a little longer than I would have liked, but that's a demonstration of how great the food is."}
{"text":"My friends and I visited on a Saturday night after skiing and we got PLENTY of food!  The nachos, cheese curds, sweet potato fries, burgers, turkey sandwich and Old Fashioned drinks were ALL wonderful!!  It's not a cheap place to eat, but certainly worth the money.  No wait, and the atmosphere is very comfy."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great vibe. Cozy evening atmosphere in downtown Middleton.  I was impressed by the vegetarian choices offered.  Most places offer 1-2 choices, Free House had about 5-6.  That made it worth our trip.  Veggie burgers with sweet potato fries were a great choice.  

Other choices included Tofu wraps, salads, portobello mushroom burgers and veggie chili.  And of course they carry the usual carnivorous choices as well."}
{"text":"This is a cozy pub/restaurant.  I enjoyed the comfortable and simple atmosphere here.  There aren't tons of signs or loud artistic displays, instead it again has a pleasant home feeling.  Since I went here for lunch with friends I didn't explore the menu in detail, but it has a fair amount of selection and everything I saw looked amazing.  Their salads are large and fresh.  I had a ham and Swiss melt which was delightfully toasted, not too greasy and the side of greens were lightly mixed as well.  The service was great - polite, friendly and there just often enough."}
