{"text":"By far the worst service I've ever received. It took almost 20 minutes to receive our drinks after we ordered them. When we finally got them, they were delivered by a different waitress.  Took another 10 minutes before our waitress came back to take our food order and almost 40 minutes after that until we got out food. My appetizer came after the rest of my food and we were never checked on during our meal. Then our waitress brought our bills before we were even done eating. Even though she asked who was together at the beginning, she brought all separate bills and all our bills were wrong. The food was alright but definitely not worth waiting almost an hour for along with the several other inconveniences."}
{"text":"Don't go there to watch CFL playoffs or grey cup. 12 TVs and they would only put it on the little tv in the far corner. Would not put it on any other TVs even when I asked. Management not stamps fans at toad and turtle I guess"}
{"text":"As Monday to Friday'ers what a rare luxury to go for a late lunch with my Hubs on a Friday! It really is too bad that our server (clerk 61) was more interested in visiting with her colleagues than pay proper attention to her tables (or at least, us). 

My steak was over done and my fries were under done (not that I was asked). I wasn't even done eating when she came over with the bill and the machine and just stood there waiting for payment. My Hubs asked for a couple of minutes to pay the bill so I could at least swallow my last bite. 

And then we were abandoned... You wonder how I know her 'clerk id' number? I had to process my own payment on the machine the server left at our table and consulted my bill to gain access because we waited so long for her to come back. 

Too bad, we typically enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Sat on the roof top patio with my fiancé. We ordered wings, chicken fingers, tacos and some drinks
1. The wings were sitting for so long they were cold on the inside. 
2. The tacos were supposed to have meat in them. They had maybe 2 tablespoons of meat between the 3 tacos. My fiancé didn't even finish them he was so disappointed (especially after the cold wings)
3. He order fries and got chips
4. I wanted to alter the watermelon jalapeño mojito so it didn't have jalapeño in it. That was not possible because it comes premixed. 
5. I ordered Caesar salad with the chicken fingers. The dressing was no where near mixed. Gobs of it were all on the bottom of the salad 
6. Got a paralyzer, had to wait about 15 min for the drink. 

The only good thing was the appetizers were 2 for 1 and the chicken fingers we didn't eat were thoroughly enjoyed by our dog. That's the only reason I'm giving more than 1 star."}
{"text":"Come down, grab a seat, and enjoy a pint. A relaxed atmosphere with a wide selection of beers on tap and cocktails created in house."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner on our way back to Edmonton this week. Will never visit again. 

We didn't get menus and when our waitress came over to ask if we'd decided what we wanted, I said we weren't sure as we still hadn't received menus (that we asked for when she brought our drinks). She brought them and we ordered wings to start. The waitress then decided it was a good idea to comment that \"if you just wanted wings they're in the drinks menu, I didn't have to bring you a dinner menu\".... not impressed. That should have been communicated to us and she should have kept her snide comment to herself. 

Ordered salt & pepper wings that were way over seasoned. I coughed each bite I took because of the drastic amount of salt. After getting our wings we ordered dinner - a spinach salad and a cheeseburger wrap. The salad was $14 and was the size of a starter. 4 pieces of spinach deep and drowning in balsamic vinegar. It was a terrible. My lips were raw by the time I left because of the amount of salt and balsamic on the food.

I should have stopped ANYWHERE else and would have been much more satisfied and would have saved money. If I hadn't been incredibly hungry, I would have stopped eating after a couple wings. 
Terrible experience. The waitress was definitely not hired for her customer service or intelligence."}
{"text":"Great Options for wing Wednesday

Busy and a little loud but it's a pub 

I'll be back"}
{"text":"Toad n Turtle has gotten a lot better since I first tested it out. 

Service is friendlier, and faster. I only seem to visit on wing nights now, but even when it's that busy I still feel welcomed. The only complaint I have since I started goof more frequently is that, on more than one occasion, the glass my drink had come in was dirty. I once even got a glass with someone else's lip imprint on the rim. Ew! The server fixed it right away but not something that should occur in a clean place.

I also wish they had a bit more selection on their patio and the tables weren't as squished together. Either way, they've improved!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times, sadly some of our favourites are gone in favour of a summer menu that isn't as appealing to us.  Our last visit was a quick lunch while D was working and I had the day off.

He had the BBQ Brisket Sandwich with fries and gravy, and I had the Steak n Prawns special with fries and a side of gravy as well.  I also tried the elderflower cider, which was delicious but very unusual in flavour so D didn't like it but I found it unique and worth trying again.

The Steak was a little over for me, I like mine medium rare and bordering on rare but it was closer to medium.  Still the seasoning was great and the fries were good, especially with the nice thick gravy.  The prawns were fresh, but it would have been nice to have a few more of them.

We'll be going back but probably not too often until the next menu change."}
{"text":"Meh...
I know yelp doesn't allow title's on reviews but that would be mine. I had not been their in a while and was in the area last night for a little mid week dinner out. 

Let's start off with the good things: 
- The restaurant seemed really clean. The tables were nicely wiped down with no weird film on them (as some tables at pubs tend to get). Every tables was neatly set up and waiting for guests. 
- The uniforms on the waitress were not too revealing and the seemed to be allowed to wear comfortable shoes. I know this is not a big deal for some people but it is for me. I don't like how some pubs have their waitress showing WAAYYY too much skin on top or on the bottom. I can't you how many times a hard working waitress has been just performing the regular functions on her job and I have seen a pantie or some boobage pop out of their 'uniform' (or lack there of), none of which is appropriate in a workplace. I also hate those restaurants that have their waitresses dress in super high heels while running their feet off and standing for long hours. I know those waitresses would never complain but as a patron I can tell your are in pain and I hate seeing it (jumping down from my soap box now).
- They have a decent sized menu. There seems to be something for everyone so I could see how the place would be really inclusive to all food tastes. 

Some of the not so good things:
- I found the food to be sorta pricey. Every plate was at least $14 for items that are less expensive at other pubs. My husband partook in the evening special which was a vegetarian pizza which was half off (that was a good deal) but the menu said it would be an 8 inch pizza and when it arrive it was 6 inches at best. I suppose maybe they 'measure' the pizza before it goes in the oven and then it's 8 inches or because it's on special it's smaller but if you were paying the full price, that pizza would be expensive for what you got. Don't get me wrong it was a tasty pizza but not worth the full price tag only worth the half off. 
-The food was just okay for the higher price tag. I had the Yorkies and I am a HUGE fan of Yorkshire pudding and these were good (my momma still makes the best thought.... SHOUT OUT TO MA!) but the roast beef was a little dry and the gravy was pretty salty and unidentifiably lumpy.  However, I just scraped that gravy off and enjoyed my plate of food, it just seemed expensive for what I got though. 
- I found the drink specials to be not that special, the Tuesday night beer special was really only $1.00 off the smallest one, $0.75 off the medium one and $0.25 off the largest one. I get it you are discounting beer and you don't want to be throwing profits away but come on, offer a better incentive and maybe it would be fuller in the restaurant. 
- The service was kinda slow to begin with. I hesitate to mention this as our waitress admitted that she was new (but in later conversation with her she said that she was there a month which is new-ish and makes me feel slightly better about mentioning this). We waited almost 20 minutes to get our menus. Not so much as a 'Hi, I'll be right with you' or an apology for the wait. She spent a lot of time chatting up the tables of men that were also assigned to her section. The place was also not really that busy so I wonder how service would be should it have been busier.

LASTLY, the down right unacceptable:
- They charge for refills on pop. WHAT?!?!?! Is it 1991? Have we stepped back into the past? Can we smoke now in this bar? Is Brian Mulroney Prime Minister? Is Ralph Klein the premier? I am sure that the menu mentions it, but, because its not 1991, I didn't even look to see if the pop was bottomless. So imagine my shock, when I received my bill and was not only charged $3.25 for a pop (which we all know cost less than a $0.25 and it was half ice) but I was charged an extra $1.00 for each refill. I was charged almost as much as a beer! If I would have had a beer, I probably would have received more actual liquid (on account of the pop being mostly ice). When we brought this to our waitresses attention she mentioned that she had just worked there a month and this was the first time she has noticed the charge. 

I know I probably won't be back to this restaurant as I felt super nickle and dimmed at this place. It wasn't that great that I can over look the feel of paying too much for what I got."}
{"text":"Really wonderful coconut shrimp and fish and chips! Didn't like the lemongrass Caesar. Service lacked at first until the manager started serving us. Would go again for the food and fairly quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"I live close by and have been there a couple times thinking \"maybe this time it won't be so bad...\". But each time is worst than the previous. 

Went on wing night, ordered 3 different flavours. The sauce was alright the wings on the other hand was either burnt or undercooked. The entire menu is over priced for the quality. 

Staff is mediocre at best. Mostly hired not for their resume but for what they look like in the \"uniform\". 

Generally unprofessional, Unhygienic and unimpressed."}
{"text":"We drove to Airdie to meet up with some friends to try this place out. There were 5 of us and we were able to get a table. Quite busy on a Mon night and a very cold night at that! 

Casual atmosphere, decent service but the pub is very new and no doubt has some kinks to work out (no drink specials yet on menu we were told by wait staff). 

The food was ok, none of our party was blown away by anything.

Ordered was:
Salad (greens)
Salmon Fish and Chips
Pub Burger
California Chicken Club
Pulled pork sandwich

Portions were alright, prices on par with Calgary standards.

The place can get loud as most pubs do so be prepared! Not really a place for kids in the evening. (rowdyness, swearing)

30 beer on tap.

Each night has a food special. Tues is half off pizza night and we were all in agreement that this is the only time we would return here - to try that out."}
{"text":"The Good: Friendly staff. Food was good quality and well prepared. Clean environment. Nice atmosphere. Staff was willing to accommodate a mess up.

The Bad: I received the wrong order. What I ordered (bison burger) was served to another customer somehow. The wrong meal was on the house which was acceptable. Anyways, they did say I'd get the right order \"to go\" on my way out.

The Ugly: I never received my bison burger."}
{"text":"Stopped on our way to Cranbrook BC from Edmonton.  Decently fast service considering it is lunch time.  Lots of beer on tap from local Alberta brewers.  Good menu with traditional comfort pub food."}
{"text":"Better than many of these reviews state, the food is quite good and the service always very friendly and prompt. You could do much worse in Airdrie."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite place in Airdrie for wing night. Great service, good wings and great company! If your going on on any other night food can be hit or miss but the amazing girls there will always make it right!"}
{"text":"Best wings in airdrie! Good service and great beer. 
We expected it to be bigger, rooftop patio is huge"}
{"text":"You said it zoey!! Absolutely disgusting! Waaay over priced! They shut off the deep fryers for our food because they wanted to stop serving food! Everything was undercooked and full of fryer grease because they were cooked at too low of temperature. The only thing decent was the drinks and even those stopped coming before we were even done the food! They wanted us to leave ASAP! Get out of there so they could stop serving a \"diner\". This phoney Toad'n'Turtle is a bunch of crock! I actually watched a waitress hike her skirt up through the evening as she probably got the 5-9 shift! It took 3 hours to be served an appetizer and main, a complete waste of time and money! I doubt they would pass a food inspection! I'm actually repulsed thinking about this place! All their \"special menu\" items are completely fake, nothings actually a deal! Worst place in Airdrie! 

Also Allison below here is a fake hired yelp reviewer that they paid to comment nicely on their page! Look how many times she reviewed places, nobody does that unless they were paid to! And notice how negative is \"sandwiched\" between 2 positives, she did that on purpose. A classic marketing expense to boost up their reviews so people might check it out."}
