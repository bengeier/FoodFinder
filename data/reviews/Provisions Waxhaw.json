{"text":"Our family truly enjoyed the food and the atmosphere for breakfast this morning. I appreciate supporting local and family owned businesses. There is a sense of community and the food is definitely made with love. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My my wife and I just had lunch at this location for the second time. The food is amazing and worth the trip into town. We ordered a smoked turkey sandwich as well as a grilled Cheerwine BBQ chicken sandwich with a side of potato salad."}
{"text":"Used to be cool but has gone WAY down hill :(

Bottom line, I would NEVER go back here and would not recommend it to a friend. This was one of the most disappointing lunch experiences I've ever had, honestly. I'm not just being dramatic.

Was looking for lunch in downtown Waxhaw on a beautiful Saturday afternoon around 2 pm. There was one couple in front of me to order. The line moved quickly and the cashier who took my order was friendly. My husband got a pulled pork sandwich and I ordered the country ham sandwich. It was to-go.

It literally took them 45 MINUTES to make our sandwiches. I checked in after about 20 minutes and the male 'chef' told me they were going as fast as they could and I should be patient, in a condescending, I don't want your business kind of way. I could see them working, the line is right there behind the counter. The two of them were the slowest workers I've ever observed, they just acted like they could care less about their tasks. I saw the woman put meat on a sandwich, then fondle it a bit, moving it around on the bread, then put it back and grab something else. They ran out of the sides I ordered, they only had one folded cutlery set (and seemed annoyed when I asked for another, since there were 2 to go boxes, and was told that's all they had?).... 45 minutes people. 

But the REAL disappointment, as if I thought it couldn't get worse, was the actual food. Disgusting. Inedible. I'm attaching a photo of the \"ham\" that was in my sandwich. It was sickly gray, cold, and super fatty. I did NOT eat it! It just didn't look safe. I ate the bread and lettuce. My husband's pulled pork was dry, with no sauce and no seasoning at all. Even the pasta salad was bland - no dressing or anything on it, just cold spiral pasta - he threw it away.

I was absolutely livid, and still am just writing about... I thought about going back to ask for my money but honestly, it probably would have taken another 30 minutes and I didn't want to ruin my afternoon having to deal with those people who honestly don't care about quality or customer service. I figured my time was better spent writing this review, warning other patrons to steer clear of this place. It's a shame because it is a very cute, rustic 'southern' looking store, I'm not sure what happened but it sounds like ownership has changed, for the worse! :("}
{"text":"Great local downtown Waxhaw spot for lunch. Staff is very friendly and food is incredible. I have tried the meatloaf sandwich and the BLT and both get 5-stars. They are worth the visit to Waxhaw. Check out some of the other foods and products they sell while you're in there!"}
{"text":"The hospitality is so refreshing. The food is good and the atmosphere is just inviting if you like that small town feel. I go there for lunch, to find other ingredients and quirky items that can't be found at the local grocery stores. The only reason that I do not give it a 5 is because the menu isn't large and they close to early."}
{"text":"Love love provisions.  It represents what Waxhaw is to me. It's a country store at it heart, yet offers so much more. From fresh local meats, dairy, cheeses to fancy soaps you'd buy in Whole Foods. Its a country store keeping up with the times without losing its charm and history. Much like Waxhaw. 

Oh, the food is good too!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken salad sandwich which was very good. Hubby had the Reuben, he said was delicious. It's suppose to be the best in town. Cute place!  Plenty of to dine in. It had a little place for kids to play with \"vintage\" toys. 
Food tasted and look very fresh!  Nice to know there are restaurants in Waxhaw that are not a franchise and owned by the locals."}
{"text":"YAY! I love this place. We just moved to Waxhaw this week and this is going to be our number one spot to grab a sandwich or snack - just lovely. 

They have an amazing selection of local spices and.. well.. provisions. We had bacon from here, just wonderful.

The chicken salad on a croissant was amazing, as was the kale salad. My husband got the Rueben and it was ooey gooey corned beef deliciousness. 

Can't wait to come back and try the breakfast too!"}
{"text":"A very unique place and the food is excellent! I do not go as often as I would like because we are usually looking for a dinner spot and they are not open for dinner. Whenever I have been for lunch, I have loved it.  Well done, food is very good, in a beautiful setting!"}
{"text":"Incredible Customer Service | Delicious Food 

The owners and employees of Provisions treat their customers with love and respect."}
{"text":"We were excited to step into this quaint restaurant for the first time. Unfortunately, as we were eating, the children's play area in the back of the dining room was very loud. Without realizing it, we felt like we entered Romper Room. The toys echoed, falling on the wood floors. 
Too loud and not too excited about returning."}
{"text":"They changed the menu so the items are not what they used to be for lunch. I will say it is super friendly in here and fun to hang out if you have the time. Still like the selection at the store."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy food. I had the meatloaf sandwich which was amazing. It came as a grilled cheese sort of sandwich--very good. 

The service is great--very attentive and helpful. 

The store is filled with lots of goodies. I imagine we could all find something in the store. Pastas, spices, mixes, meats, you name it!"}
{"text":"I visited Provisions for lunch and really wanted to love this place.  The restaurant is so cute and it's located in downtown Waxhaw which is such a quant authentic small town with a great local atmosphere. 

Despite the atmosphere, the food was nothing special. They cook everything on a hot plate and do not have ice.  They do not have a proper kitchen to serve out of so the food was probably going to be bad anyway and there is not much that can be done about it.  

The store/restaurant does have a wide selection of packaged specialty good such as high quality herbs and spices and locally made or sourced foods (butter, eggs, meat, cheese spread and breads). 

I would go back to the store for items such as local butter and eggs but not for a meal."}
{"text":"Love this place every time we go. Excellent choice for a lunch date. So far I've had the Turkey, Italian, and Reuben. Each were a suggestion from the chef and I have thoroughly enjoyed it every time. Tried the Reuben today-- excellent crunch texture of the bread, crisp hot ingredients and melty cheesy goodness of a perfect classic. Lentil soup was a flavorful complement to the sandwich. You get quality and quantity for what you pay for here and our meals always come out much quicker than expected. From the market side of the store I recommend the black raspberry cheesecake mix and apple hard candies. This restaurant will remain a favorite for sure"}
{"text":"Fun little shop with large selection of local products!! Delicious food with good service. You have to try the ham pimento melt. It's fantastic!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here after seeing Maxwell's Tavern was packed and we were too hungry to wait. 

I ordered the pimento cheese & ham melt which was very tasty and perfectly melted. My mom ordered the specialty quiche and said it was dry and bland. My grandma ordered the Italian hero, also bland. My grandpa ordered the meatloaf sandwich, which was better than most.

In my grandma's potato salad we found a fly at the bottom... alive... it made our stomach's turn to say the least. I would give one star simply for the bland food and fly, but the staff was exceptionally nice and attentive. 

I probably won't be back unless I'm really craving good pimento cheese."}
{"text":"Best damn Meatloaf Sandwich I've ever had.....  Plenty of eye candy on the shelves as well."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Great service. Super friendly. Loved the local food. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place, it's our favorite in Waxhaw. Super family friendly, food is always great and has good ingredients. Nice music always playing, chill atmosphere. We like to buy their milk and other items off the shelves too! 
It's hard to find good options for gluten free and vegetarian in Waxhaw.....many options at Provisions!"}
{"text":"The family and I are big fans of Provisions Waxhaw. We purchase a lot of our pantry items in bulk from them, like dry beans, salt, seasonings, etc. They also have a lot of different items that are hard to find like lavender and saffron. What would make this place even better is if they reduce all the plastic containers they use to sell their merchandise. It would be perfect if they sold their larger bulk items like Wholefoods where you bring in your own bags to purchase.

But in any case, their restaurant was a perfect addition to the store. The food is really flavorful and yummy."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow, ordered two biscuits, one had cheese, but the other was plain. Took them over 20+ minutes to get a to-go order out, and they weren't even busy, no apologizes either for taking so long. Get the biscuits finally, and they aren't done on the inside, but doughy. On top of that, they were so salty I couldn't even get through two bites, they had a baking soda after taste. They have some work to do on the food for sure. 

The overall place, it's an adorable concept! Provisions as a whole with being able to buy local eggs, meats, butter, spreads and high end herbs, that's for sure going to sell. They just have room to grow in their food department! A brush up on customer service wouldn't help them either. 

I know places have bad days, so I'll come back again to give it a second try, but for a first timer trying the food, not impressed. I've heard lunch is better (my parents have eaten here), but still they commented service was slow."}
{"text":"Indeed the best Ruben in town - tender, piled high and stacked perfectly on toasted, marbled rye bread (the way it SHOULD be!). The Chicken Salad is spectacular as well, featuring flavorful thigh meat on a buttery croissant . Even though it was 95+ degrees outside, the Tomato & Basil Soup was a huge hit with our four top. 

Outstanding service from the attentive wait staff and an adorable team working the front of the house. Shop the food market and micro-antique nook coming and going."}
{"text":"This is an awesome breakfast place for the whole family! My family just recently went there for the first time and it was really good. We were seated right away and the food was brought out in a timely manner. The store is filled with a lot of local items that make the store very unique! I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a good breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"Following a change of ownership, the quality is back. Great paninis and good service.  We gave it another try and you should too."}
{"text":"This little spot is so delightful! The atmosphere is so quaint & homey! It's just so unique & different. Casual & laid back. I love it.

The food is delicious! I love that their food is all locally supplied. Everything is fresh! We ordered the busicuts & gravy (only available on the weekends), a homestyle grit bowl & 1 pancake. We shared it all & left nothing on the plate! Nothing about this was ordinary.

If your looking for great atmosphere & great food that's not a chain restaurant.... this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Today I saw a man selling poppies kstop a lady and asked if he could re-posiktion her poppy. While doing so he told thsat lady she should wear the poppy on their right side; the red represents the blood of gall those who gave their lives, the black represents the mourning of those who didn't have their loved ones return home, and the green leaf represents the grass and crops growing and future prosperity after the war destroyed so much. The leaf should be positioned at 11 o'clock to represent the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, the time that s?World War One formally ended. He was worried that younger generations wouldn't understand this and his generation wouldn't be around for much longer to teach them.

{"text":"The food is delicious and we love what it stands for.  Sustainable, ethical, farm fresh foods. We've gone here for lunch on a few occasions as well and it's great.  The service is nice and the vibe is good, even for children.  They'll play in the play area while we wait for the food."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Great surprise- everything fresh and from local vendors. Friendly, pleasant and the store offers a variety of gourmet cooking essentials. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today. The lady taking our order was so nice and friendly, including taking to my son directly. The owner came out to talk to us and was so friendly.  Oh, and the food was so yummy!  You can tell that all of the food was definitely homemade."}
{"text":"Provisions Waxhaw is a great spot to grab a coffee, breakfast / lunch, or pre-made snacks and meals. I had breakfast here on a Saturday. This place gives old country store vibes, and they have the hospitality to match.

The restaurant was quite busy on a Saturday morning. We ordered at the counter, found a seat, and then explored the store as we waited for our food. We had the grits, french toast, and croissant sandwich. All were delicious! 

The prices are super affordable, the place is very family friendly, and the food is great. As a warning, it is pretty loud as there are tons of families with small children here, so if you're looking for a quite meal I'd go somewhere else. The noise wasn't an issue for us!"}
{"text":"Cool place, hardwood floors and rustic feel. Their thing is sandwiches, salads and soups. Some items stay on the menu and some move off making room for specials and seasonal options. 

Most everything is from local sources and it's all fresh. They have milk, butter, cheese, eggs etc for sale from local farms. 

When they first opened I wasn't impressed but as with good establishments they figure it out. They have become more creative with their sandwiches and I've tried most of them. The last item I had was the Thanksgiving which is an open faced option. It's exactly what you think it would be and it was awesome. 

Happy this place opened that offers great fresh food...check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Fresh, amazing, LOCAL food! The roasted chicken salad is amazing and the Cuban is so delicious!  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. A definite stop for us when in Waxhaw!"}
{"text":"Take Yelper Theresa's  review regarding the folks are rude at this establishment with a grain of salt. BELIEVE ME it's completely the contrary ( sure anything can  happen) the staff is SOOO gracious and WE locals know it & appreciate it! :) 

I live down the road hence frequent Provisions OFTEN & I have NEVER experienced or witnessed at NO TIME anyone being treated rudely or indifferently. Of course everyone has a bad day (we ALL do) but to award such a LOW rating based on her commentary is sad & a bit much! 
The public is wise, they know people utilize Yelp & other sites as a form of draino ...they would complain IF they encountered a $100 dollar bill on the floor but would become upset after realizing it had fingerprints. Can't pls everyone \"but\" we locals are VERY proud of the staff at Provisions ...they could not possibly be anymore helpful & genuine! 

Provisions is 1 of my favorite stores in downtown Wax! They have so many different items to choose from such as goat soaps, great variety of Amish teas, unique candies, homemade Lavender laundry soap, baked goods, fun kitchen towels to include homemade cough syrup  AND the BEST part I left for last.  

GET READY!!!! Drum roll ...NO need to drive all over Charlotte as they house a good selection of Gluten Free products! Yayyyyyy, music to many ears :) 
They have phenomenal gluten free products that taste sensational, try their chocolate sprinkle donuts, they  are a MUST, truly scrumptiously delicious. 
They carry gluten free cookies, pastas, bread and it's nice to have an option to select gf bread with ones sandwich. 

I can't imagine Waxhaw downtown without Provisions, it would be tough & heartbreaking as their food is so FRESH & TASTY as is their soups. 

We love you ALL & be in the know \"most of us\" do appreciate your long hours & hard work that \"some\" don't seem to take into account.   

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"We both eat out fill. Huge vegetarian options and vegan for the Wife and wow the local bacon and sausage are great! I love farm kitchen feel. It's not you run of the mill breakfast and we love it!"}
{"text":"Love their breakfast! Everything has been great that I've tried. Fresh and they even have gluten free options. It's a great local spot. I like shopping the little store too."}
{"text":"What an interesting place to stop....   it was confusing where to start when we first walked in.  But we figured it out... 
Love the food selections!!!  We were a bit frustrated to find out that drinks were just a variety of pre packaged drinks that were very highly priced... I figured I'd save money by getting a water...  nope, still so expensive, only to find out when I walked into the dining room that there was free water in there.  I really wish the person at the counter would have said something!!!  I felt deceived. :/
It was nice to walk around and look at things while we waited for our food... so many interesting things to see.
All of our food was fantastic.  But for 5 of us to eat lunch on a Sunday, and pay $65, I would have at least hoped we wouldn't have left hungry....   but we were all still hungry!!!
If they had a better system for drinks, and either lower prices or bigger portions, I would have given this place 4 or 5 stars, and we would already be planning a return visit."}
