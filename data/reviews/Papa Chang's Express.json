{"text":"So convenience to buy Taiwanese's food in Pacific Mall, it is so delicious, specially the chicken bento, must try, recommend to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Papa Chang's always has a place in my heart. It is always my number one! And I think it will be staying at that number one spot for even longer!  Whenever someone asks for a suggestion of where to eat, I would always say Papa Chang's. This is back when Papa Chang's only had one location, but I always told people ... It was worth it! What I liked about the original location is the consistency. I always, always say this in my reviews, but consistency is key.   It doesn't matter when I go to Papa Chang's. Morning, lunch or even late night. The food will be cooked the same and in perfect seasoning at any time of the day. It never changes. And that's one thing I appreciate.   And fortunately, this new Papa Chang's Express location has nailed it to a tee. I'll be honest, I kind of had my doubts. Because whenever a certain food place starts to branch out, it won't be same as the original. And there will always be heavy differences between the two. But the Express location just slammed that all down. It was honestly like I had gone to the original location.   I'm just super happy and relieved that I won't be having to travel so up North now to get my Chang fix, since Pmall is soooo much closer to me!  If you haven't tried Papa Chang's, you gotta try it! Absoloutely top notch Taiwanese food that just can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Taste just like Papa Chang's restaurant (as it should) but sometimes the food court version isn't as good. We just ordered a chicken skewer (3 pieces for $5) and fish skewers (3 pieces for $5). Decent price and it's good, made fresh to order.   I gave them 4 stars because the batter fell off our chicken skewers.. it just wasn't sticking and she put a bit too much wasabi on the chicken so it masked the actual taste of the chicken."}
{"text":"Pa Pa Chang's Express   My Wife and I visited Pa Pa Chang's Express with hopes that we would have an equally enjoyable experience as we did with the main branch at Highway 16.   We enjoyed the main branch a bit better than the Express version.   We ordered the Chicken Skewers, Popcorn Chicken Bento, and for take away we ordered the Popcorn Chicken.   Tho when we ordered the chicken skewers, the staff member did not make it clear that it was regular mayo or wasabi mayo with the chicken skewers.  All she stated was if we wished for \"wasabi\" which in my mind was the perception of wasabi that goes with sushi.  So I declined the wasabi.  When I went home and checked other users comments about chicken skewers on Yelp, I learned that it was supposed to be \"wasabi mayonnaise\" if that was the case when we ordered I would have accepted the wasabi mayo gratefully.   We found the popcorn chicken to be a bit salty for our tastes.  We plan to order popcorn chicken at the main location and see if there is a difference in salt content.   Sadly no filtered water offered at Pa Pa Chang's Express. :(   For at least the Popcorn chicken, rice bowls, bento box and skewers we're willing to revisit Pa Pa Chang's Express.  Anything else, we would likely go to the main location at Highway 16 due to the larger menu."}
{"text":"Recommended by a coworker, we came for lunch.  I enjoyed the popcorn chicken however my husband thinks another establishment's is better.  The pieces were quite big and had meat not just battered.  We had a rice bowl with minced beef and sausage and a hard boiled egg which was very nice.  We also shared some soup noodles.  Very good lunch spot."}
{"text":"Typical Asian restaurant but smaller in size and quality of food is decent. Interior is simple and the price is quite cheap. Although this location is small, its not too busy and the service is quick. Much like many Asian restaurant, the servers have limited English vocabulary and it can be difficult to communicate. Noise level is at a low and good place to grab a quick meal."}
{"text":"mmm Papa Chang's.. need I say more?   I was really craving and went to the original restaurant only to realize that they were closed for the day. Ended up going to PMall's express location instead.  This is in the upstairs food court. I ordered the signature rice bowl with egg, sausage and ground pork. My partner ordered the bento box with satay beef. We also got fish skewers.   Loved the fish skewers, rice was decent,but the satay beef could have been better.   Overall, great food for a decent price. I will def come more often to try other items on the menu =)"}
{"text":"not as good as their Markham/16 shop but still way better than most of the competitions"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  It;s quaint, affordable and most of all consistent. I love the minimal variety of choices because you know the chefs perfect that product and cuisine. Ive had Taiwanese popcorn chicken in various places but I think Papa Chang is one of the best imo. It is also close to where I live so it is always a joy to go stop by and take out. I also very much enjoy their sausage and minced pork rice. The veggie combo and fishcakes and radish makes the combo savory from the heavier batter of the chicken and sausage.   Honestly I have only had two things at Papa Chang and everytime I either get the popcorn chicken or Sausage minced pork rice. It has became a comfort food which I very much enjoy."}
{"text":"Wow....Papa said knock you out!!!   If you have been craving a new taste. Do yourself a favour and try out the chicken  skewers!!! Explosion of taste's....  Hidden upstairs in the food court in Pacific Mall is a new to go place.  Think dim sum boiled chickens deep fried and breaded and presented in a skewer with a sweet sauce and wasabi sauce sprinkled on top...the mixture of mustard spicy and sweet and tender chicken was mesmerizing. I lie to you not- I was with three heterosexual male co-workers and we were all silently chewing away and every time I stared into their eye..we had a moment- a moment to define that we were in love. In love with the same chick - en!!!!  I had to of course try the popcorn chicken- which would have been amazing if I didnt just have my taste buds blown away by that skewer. However - for $8 I was left feeling very very nourished.   Please tell papa chang- I will be a good boy, I will listen and I will eat all my food.  P.S- my co-worker asked for his popcorn chicken to be spicier- so they added a little spice shake and it altered the flavour completely. I asked for wasabi on top of mine as well and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Papa Chang's! It is hands down the best Taiwanese restaurant in the GTA that I've tried. Unfortunately the express location doesn't offer the same quality or quantity of food as the other locations. I had the Taiwanese sausage with minced pork on rice, and my sausages were tiny! My fiance got the braised pork bento box, and you could tell that the sides were reheated and even the sauce was kind of jelly-like. It was still good, but definitely under performs the 16th/markham rd and richmond hill locations."}
{"text":"Located right inside pmall upstairs floor food court. At first was a little hard to find, but there are signs in the centre of the food court to direct where papa chang is. I love their original location on 16th and thought how convenient it is to have an express version of it closer to the heart of scarb/markham. Only come for the popcorn chicken though as it is my favourite of all time here!! Price is fair for the amount of popcorn chicken you get. Super crispy and the meat is tasty and tender. The only down fall is it does get a little salty and oily after eating so many in one sitting (but who can you blame... thats what you're getting into anyways!) Will definitely return when i have that craving for popcorn chicken and am in and around that area!"}
{"text":"Papa Chang's has one of the best popcorn chicken I've ever had and after I knew that they had opened a second location on the top floor of Pacific Mall as an express eatery, I had always kept it in the back of my mind to go visit.  When I arrived at the express eatery, they were just opening for business.  It was just before 11 a.m. on a holiday.  Luckily for me, the man behind the counter agreed to sell me a serving of their popcorn chicken even though their cashier staff hadn't arrived yet.  (I had waited a few minutes already.)   The popcorn chicken was deep fried and lightly battered with salt and pepper.  Mmm, this was the best!  I really appreciated the decent-sized portion too.  For $6.20 after tax, this was a very reasonable serving of fried chicken bites.  Since it was so hot and fresh from the fryer, it was so enjoyable to eat.  The pieces of chicken were substantial too and there were a good number of large and small pieces."}
{"text":"Not sure why the hight reviews!!!! This place is okay if you come drunk. When all your taste bids are out of wack. The food is eatable but nowhere close to traditional. The fact that its not own by Taiwanese people explains it. So if you want okay eatable food you can try it out. But if you want traditional, unfortunately this probably not a good spot. Aorry to be so harsh but when I left this place i was actually pretty upset."}
{"text":"Delicious cheap eat! The place is very small and only has a few tables. When I went it was undoubtedly full so we had to wait for a little bit. The popcorn chicken was delicious! We also ordered this taiwanese pancake type dish with wasabi on it. It was really good, a little more wasabi than I'd like but still good. A lot of the food has wasabi in it which can be a little overpowering for those who aren't used to it. But as someone who doesn't eat wasabi at all, I really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Delicious popcorn chicken! $5.99 an order and you definitely get enough pieces to put bbt places to shame (you know, if you ever order from those places). I haven't tried the popcorn chicken from Hot Star yet so I can't compare, but this place is probably the best tasting + value IMO.  If you're wondering where it is, you have to walk through the middle aisles, it's not on the outer shops. Definitely don't wanna miss!"}
{"text":"Whenever I need a Taiwanese food fix, I can rely on this place. Enough said.   I'm glad they opened this location which is more convenient for myself and everyone else. Even though it's a small place, their kitchen is stocked well & service is fast. Taiwanese people practice their menu to the tee so as long as they're consistent, which Papa Chang is, there's no going wrong with ordering from them. It's not the healthiest of foods, but their authentic flavours sure pack a punch!"}
{"text":"I love the original Papa Chang's so I was excited when they opened a more conveniently located spot in Pacific Mall. However, the menu's smaller and the food tastes a little different, but it's still decent.   I usually like to get the beef noodle soup at the main location but they didn't have it on the menu the last two times I went.   On my latest visit, I ordered the thick soup with pork and vermicelli noodles. The broth was a bit too salty. I also had a side of pork and cabbage which was pretty tasty and good with a side of rice.  I also tried the Taiwanese sausage with rice which was decent.   Overall, it does satisfy the craving for Taiwanese food, but is missing that extra something that makes the main location that much better."}
{"text":"Minced pork on rice is my fave!   Food is served hot and fresh, pretty average amount of food for the price.   Place is not busy during dinner time on weekdays. As expected, more rice than meat for what you pay."}
{"text":"Still good, and the other review still applies. Here's an update though. My first time having intestine noodles was here! I've been wanting to try it for so long, and I've finally had it! Yes! My thought on it here though, is that the bowl is surprisingly small for the price. It's about $6.50 for a bowl, and the bowl is the size of a side soup bowl. Given that the rest of their stuff is decent for value, I'm left disappointed in this dish. It was tasty though. I love that goopy texture."}
{"text":"Great deal at pmall food court.  Always service with a smile.  Popcorn chicken bento with rice is a great deal at $7.  Chicken tastes great.  Much better value than hot star chicken.  One bento with sides really fills u up.  Not a fan of the fried chicken skewers with mayo sauce though."}
{"text":"Decided to spend an afternoon at Pacific Mall just browsing and trying out the various food options. It's been awhile since I've been here so I've never noticed this stall before. I decided to try the fried chicken skewers and to my surprise I really enjoyed it. The chicken itself was moist and the combination of sauces and ingredients was great. The rest of the menu looked interesting too so very interested to try them out.  The price of the skewers were average and the staff was pretty friendly when taking my order and giving me my food. I hope to try some more of their items next time so I'll update this review once I do."}
{"text":"Food is cheap but tasty.  I would recommend it to everyone who likes Taiwanese food. It's on the second level of pacific mall. Fast and easy. Have been there once in a while, never disappointed. Only thing is that you have to be okay to eat at the food court and be patient when you try to find a seat because it's pretty packed usually."}
{"text":"Papa Chang's is pretty good, especially for mall food.  Their bento boxes are great. The pork cutlet one is my favourites.  The fried chicken pieces are good too, but gets a bit too salty after a few bites so you might want to share those."}
{"text":"I love papa Chang's original location and I was really excited when I found out this location opened because it is much more convenient being closer to Toronto.   My usual items are the minced pork on rice and the popcorn chicken bento. I ordered these items here to share with a friend and we brought it over to the food court tables to eat.   My first thoughts was that the popcorn chicken wasn't crispy. It was soggy. I was really disappointed because the fried foods at the original location tasted freshly made. Whereas this location lacks in the quality of the food. Perhaps it's because it's in a booth inside a mall and there are less customers compared to the original restaurant location, and the turnaround for food is slower so it is less fresh. But regardless, I was quite disappointed and I will probably not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Papa Chang's is probably the safest place to eat in Pacific Mall. It has a wide variety of Taiwanese snacks and meals, ranging from skewers, bento boxes, tofu pudding and more. There usually never is a line and food does not ever take over 10 minutes to be served. The food is reasonably priced and is quite filling. The Taiwanese sausage and minced pork on rice is flavourful and not extremely salty, which is common in many Taiwanese places. Bento boxes at Papa Chang's are also great because of the numerous main options and how delicious the three sides are. The only thing that is not all that great for me, is the popcorn chicken because it tastes like it could come from any other shop that had popcorn chicken on the menu for three fourths of their price. Honestly, Papa Chang's is a place with good food, but there is no wow factor that makes it exceptional. Nonetheless, this place is still a good option to eat when at Pacific Mall."}
{"text":"Papa Chang Express is located in Pacific Mall on the second floor where all the food places are. Don't be intimated by the hustle and bustle of the area as it's meant to replicate the traditional Asian markets. We ordered a popcorn chicken bento and a braised pork with preserved veggie bento. Both of these boxes came with rice and a generous portion of meat as you can see from my photos below. The chicken was tender, boneless, flavourful and the batter was cooked to a nice crisp. The braised pork was soft, juicy and had the right amount of flavour! Especially the fatty parts. Our only complaint about the food was that the rice was a bit too hard.   Seating can be problematic as the area can be very busy due to proximity to other eateries. We had to walk around the upper level to find seating to eat. We eventually walked back to Papa Changs where they have about four seats hidden on the side. Overall a good place to try authentic Taiwanese cuisine at a good price. Will definitely return to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a coupe friends, they recommended this place for Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken.  Been meaning to check it out for a while now since I always pass by.  Popcorn chicken meat was super juicy and tender. Wasn't too much batter, in fact, I would say the batter was just right. The portion was good size.  Also ordered their Taiwanese Minced Pork Rice, had to pay extra for the egg.  This dish was so-so, it didn't taste bad by any means - your typical restaurant quality, I just have had much better at a few other places.. the portion was pretty small..   I know of their 16 and Markham Road location and it's in my Yelp bookmarks, would give it a try if someone wanted to go, but don't have an urge to go anymore..  Take out for the two items totalled $12.40.."}
{"text":"Nom, nom, nom! Taiwanese snacks, yay!  I've been to the Papa Chang restaurant on 16th & Markham Rd, but I don't remember their chicken skewer being that delicious! Or did I not eat this there?!  For $5 you get 3 skewers. 3!!  If you think about it, it's a pretty good deal considering the portion is pretty decent.  I came here twice.  The first time -  it was so amazing I just HAD to buy another $5 worth. The batter, the sauce, the seaweed.. Everything went together so well. The chicken was fresh and juicy.. bursting with flavour! I personally preferred no wasabi, because the wasabi was so strong that it covered up the mayo and seaweed taste. So I asked for wasabi on only one of the skewer. The lady was nice and gave us a lot of sauce and seaweed.  The second time - ohmygawd, what is this?!... Where's my delicious chicken skewer... They cheaped out on the sauce AND the seaweed. How dare they!  So I asked for more. The same lady from last time looked at me (probably secretly cursing at me for asking for more seaweed =( ) and she sprinkled a little bit of seaweed. Well, if I didn't know any better it looked the same. Oh well. This time around, the batter fell right off the chicken. The chicken was not properly cooked and didn't taste too fresh. What a disappointment.  But I will return! Because I always go to pmall anyways. I will return for my chicken skewer! The one that tasted so great the first time.."}
{"text":"i would recommend minced pork on rice, good portion for only $3.49, and the chicken skewers with wasabi mayo was good too!"}
{"text":"Papa chang is always packed with people and long line-up, but it's totally worth the wait.  For first time comer: Must order - popcorn chicken, green onion fried cake with egg, crispy intestine, meat floss pancake"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good reviews for Papa Chang's regular sit-in restaurants. Was pretty excited to try their express version at Pacific Mall. I'm a pretty big fan of Taiwanese food and my usual order includes popcorn chicken. I ordered the popcorn chicken bento here and a side of \"Tender Chicken\". I figured that the side would be similar to popcorn chicken which they had and would be convenient as a snack for dinner. My order was ready in no time but I was pretty confused with what I received. The \"Tender Chicken\" was apparently deep fried mushrooms on a skewer?! I double checked the Chinese name for it with my friend and sure enough, it says mushroom in Chinese. Pretty disappointed with the fact that it was mislabeled."}
{"text":"Papa Chang's Express located inside Pacific Mall is good to get some Taiwanese snacks and comfort food.  Tucked in the 2nd floor in the middle of all these alleys and stalls. Just walk around, you will find it eventually.   Minced Pork with Sausage ($3.49) and Popcorn Chicken ($4.99) were both ok. Not gourmet food but more like street food for a quick snack. The use of dark meat for the popcorn chicken did make the pieces more moist but I highly recommend sharing that, as the taste did get a little boring after a few pieces.  Place your order and walk around for 10 to 15 minute and your order will be ready."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their minced pork on rice and sausage. Haven't had such an enjoyable Taiwanese dish for a while ever since I moved back here from Vancouver. Will go to their main location next time!"}
{"text":"I tried their chicken skewers with my friends, and although they enjoyed it, I was not a fan of the sauces they used. Chicken was well done though, and I would return to try other items on their menu.   Solid three for now, but may change in the future."}
{"text":"Grabbed some food here since I was craving Papa Chang stuff but didn't want to go the distance. The food here is so far behind in quality compared to Papa Chang at Markham Road.   They had probably the worst popcorn chicken I ever had recalled. It's hard to even start. It had some cartilage mixed in and overall it tasted horrid. I only ate a few pieces and just buffered it with rice because I was hungry.  This branch didn't even have the deep fried pork belly. Though I am afraid on how they would F it up considering how badly they F'ed up the popcorn chicken.   I didn't even bother trying out the lurofan. Because if you saw it, it was a just a couple of spoonfuls of meat over a disproportionate amount of rice.   Never going to go there again. Might as well go for Chung King takeout.  Or go the distance and head over to 16th and Markham Road to get the proper one."}
{"text":"I have been to Papa Changs in Markham before but not the express location at Pacific Mall. It's located in the 2nd floor where there are many stalls so there is no place to sit down and eat. I ordered the standard minced pork with rice and pickled veggies, which is a standard Taiwanese staple dish. The minced beef was very tasty and the pickled veggies was good, but I could tell that it was probably microwaved frozen food and it was in a take out container when I asked for eating in. When I tried to pay with credit card, I was told that there was a 0.50 cent charge which surprised me. As well, the egg was an extra 0.50 cents when i thought it usually came with that dish. The pricing was very cheap and affordable for $5.99 But the extra costs were very surprising. If I were to go back, it wouldn't be to this express location though."}
